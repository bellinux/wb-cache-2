25|$|Born in Oldham, Lancashire, Maynard {{was brought}} up {{on the island of}} Anglesey in North Wales where he first joined Glamorgan. His career started in fine fashion when he hit a century on his debut in 1985, hitting three {{consecutive}} sixes to reach the 100 and he became the youngest-ever player to score 1,000 runs for the country in 1986. The 54 centuries he scored for Glamorgan during his playing career is also a record - the most any player has scored for the club. These displays of skill did not go unnoticed by the England selectors and he earned a call-up against the West Indies at the Oval in 1988. He was picked again in 1989 but then ran foul of the cricketing authorities by agreeing to go with Mike Gatting, on the controversial rebel tour of South Africa when that country had been banned from international sport because of its policy of apartheid. He later justified his decision by saying that he was desperate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> of international cricket having just been dropped from the England team. Nevertheless, his conduct led to a three-year Test ban, but he was eventually granted a recall for the Ashes series in 1993 after he had hit a century for Glamorgan against the Australians, but he failed to make much of an impact with the bat.|$|E
500|$|Both Æthelberht and Sæberht died around 616 or 618, {{causing a}} crisis for the mission. Sæberht's three sons had not {{converted}} to Christianity, and drove Mellitus from London. Bede says that Mellitus was exiled because he refused the brothers' request <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> of the sacramental bread. Whether this occurred immediately after Sæberht's death or later {{is impossible to}} determine from Bede's chronology, which has both events in the same chapter but gives neither an exact time frame nor the elapsed time between the two events. The historian N. J. Higham connects {{the timing of this}} episode with a change in the [...] "overkingship" [...] from the Christian Kentish Æthelberht to the pagan East Anglian Raedwald, which Higham feels happened after Æthelberht's death. In Higham's view, Sæberht's sons drove Mellitus from London because they had passed from Kentish overlordship to East Anglian, and thus no longer needed to keep Mellitus, who was connected with the Kentish kingdom, in office.|$|E

He tried to grasp the hand, first with his paws, then with his mouth; but I had too much fear of his great cutting teeth to let him succeed.

60|$|Do what he would, Unc' Billy couldn't get {{the thought}} of eggs off his mind, and the more he thought about them the more he wanted some.

He had long ago {{resolved}} never again to go there, but the longing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> of eggs was too much for his good resolutions, and as soon as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun sank to rest behind the Purple Hills, and the Black Shadows came creeping across the Green Meadows and through the Green Forest, Unc' Billy slipped away, taking pains that old Mrs. Possum shouldn't suspect where he was going.|$|E
60|$|It was {{morning when}} I {{came back to}} the salmon pool. Unlike the mossy forest floor, the hard rock bore no signs to tell me--what I was most curious to know--whether he came down the tree or found some other way over the mountain. At the point where I had stood when his deep Hoowuff! first startled me I left a big salmon, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> of which any bear will go far out of his way. Next morning it was gone; and so it may be that Mooween, on his next journey, found another and a pleasanter {{surprise}} awaiting him {{at the turn of the}} trail.|$|E
60|$|But Amyas {{thought that}} enough {{was as good}} as a feast, and they held on downwards, while the slaves followed, without a sign of gratitude, but meekly obedient to their new masters, and testifying now and then by a sign or a grunt, their {{surprise}} at not being beaten, or made to carry their captors. Some, however, caught sight of the little calabashes of coca which the English carried. That woke them from their torpor, and they began coaxing abjectly (and not in vain) <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> of that miraculous herb, which would not only make food unnecessary, and enable their panting lungs to endure that keen mountain air, but would rid them, for awhile at least, of the fallen Indian's most unpitying foe, the malady of thought.|$|E

6000|$|Indeed, {{the latter}} has taken {{complete}} command at the tap-room of the tavern, {{not so much because}} he has convinced, as because he has out-talked all the old-established oracles. The apothecary, with all his philosophy, was as nought before him. He has convinced and converted the landlord at least a dozen times; who, however, is liable to be convinced and converted the other way, by the next person with whom he talks. It is true the radical has a violent antagonist in the landlady, who is vehemently loyal, and thoroughly devoted to the king, Master Simon, and the Squire. She now and then comes out upon the reformer with all the fierceness of a cat-o'-mountain, and does not spare her own soft-headed husband, for listening to what she terms such [...] "low-lived politics." [...] What makes the good woman the more violent, is the perfect coolness with which the radical listens to her attacks, drawing his face up into a provoking supercilious smile; and when she has talked herself out of breath, quietly asking her <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> of her home-brewed.|$|E
6000|$|To {{return to}} the Antique, what the President's [...] "Captive Andromache" [...] must have cost in models alone is {{difficult}} to reckon. When times were cheaper, fifty years since, my ancient Britons in [...] "Boadishia" [...] stood me in thirty pounds: the central figures, however, were members of my own family. To give every one his due, [...] "Andromache" [...] is high art--yes, it is high--and the Antique has not been overlooked. About the back-view of the young party at the fountain Mr. Horsley {{may have something to}} say. For my part, there seems a want of muscle in vigorous action: where are the BICEPS, where are the thews of Michael Angelo? The President is a touch too quiet <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> framed in the best schools. As to his colour, where is that nutty brown tone of the flesh? But the designs on the Greek vase are carefully rendered; though I have heard it remarked by a classical scholar that these kind of vases were not in use about Homer's time. Still, the intention is good, though the costumes are not what WE should have called Ancient Roman when the President was a boy--ay, or earlier.|$|E

Pat, I hope that spring is still open where you put the minnows last fall. Suppose you take this net and pail and see what you can find." [...] He opened a small folding net as he was speaking. [...] "I take it for granted that you youngsters have your belt axes with you, as good Scouts in the woods should. One of you can run over to that alder thicket and cut a dozen straight sticks about three feet long and as thick as my forefinger. The other two can chop holes in the ice. They don't need to be very big, you know, not over a foot across. I suggest that you scatter them pretty well. It adds to the fun to have them some distance apart, and it multiplies the chances of a good catch. While you are doing that I will start a fire and get things started for lunch." ...|$|E
