5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was that the boys would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the car on the way asked their father to speak to <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, {{it was the last time}} he saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{confirmed}} in the Catholic Church in 1966, she adopted Veronica as a confirmation name. She {{was raised in}} the Detroit suburbs of Pontiac and Avon Township (now Rochester Hills). Months before her mother died of breast cancer at age 30 on December 1, 1963, Madonna noticed changes in her behavior and personality, although she did not understand the reason. Her mother was at a loss to explain her medical condition, and often began to cry when Madonna questioned <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying.|$|E

The next day they wake up after spending {{the night in the}} same bed, and Naz later watches Sol at dance rehearsals. Asher returns a necklace to Naz, and Sol sees this. He confronts <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. She insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. In an attempt to get Naz and Sol to reconcile again, Stevie pretends to swallow the key to the flat's front door, leaving them trapped. Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol angrily says she can stay there. When left alone, they get close again, but Asher interrupts them when he returns. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he sarcastically tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. She returns home and prepares to leave for Turkey but her father discovers she has escaped through a window.

25|$|Nadezhda von Meck's {{claim of}} {{bankruptcy}} {{was not entirely}} untrue. Along with his fortune, Karl von Meck had left a sizable amount of debt upon his death, and this debt proved {{to be far more}} extensive than his wife had previously known. Rumors of this debt started circulating publicly in the early 1880s. Tchaikovsky had questioned <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in his letters.|$|E
25|$|His wife Mary has {{recently}} returned from treatment for drug addiction and has put on weight as a result. She is looking much healthier than the family has been accustomed to, and they remark frequently on her improved appearance. However, she still retains the haggard facial features of a long-time addict. As a recovering addict, she is restless and anxious. She also suffers from insomnia, which is not made any easier by her husband and children's loud snoring. When Edmund, her younger son, hears her moving around at night and entering the spare bedroom, he becomes alarmed, {{because this is the}} room where, in the past, she would satisfy her morphine addiction. He questions <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> indirectly. She reassures him that she just went there to get away from her husband's snoring.|$|E
500|$|In {{his senior}} year, Ostrum was {{involved}} in film class and, at the interest {{of one of his}} instructors, looked back into theatre and acting. [...] After auditioning for, but not landing, several roles (including Equus on Broadway), Ostrum decided not to pursue it further. [...] After putting his short film career behind him, Ostrum declined reporters and interviews, preferring not to speak on the subject; [...] "I wanted people to judge me on who I was, not what Iâ€™d done". [...] For some time, Ostrum even lied and told people that his brother, and not he, had starred in the film. [...] It took Ostrum years after moving to Lowville before he told anybody there about his one-time stardom; even his wife Loretta did not know about his role until he warned <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> just before she met his mother.|$|E

500|$|Lead vocalist Mark Hall {{says that}} [...] "Praise You In This Storm" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's experience with a young girl, Erin Browning. The band made arrangements to meet Erin, who had performed a dance at her public school to one of the band's songs, and her family on Valentine's Day 2004 before one of their concerts. Right around the time the band connected with Erin and her family was when she was found to have cancer. Erin died on November 1, 2004. According to Hall, [...] "Watching [...] walk through this really showed me truth about my worship. Watching her walk through a real storm showed me that my worship was extremely situational". Hall began writing the song before Erin's death and told <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but was not able to complete it before she died.|$|E
500|$|At age 17, she {{returned}} from Northwestern [...] "in disgrace" [...] after failing {{out of school}} and unable to tell her family why. But she was compelled to continue her search for information. She found some in the novels available at the time: Nightwood, The Well of Loneliness, and Extraordinary Women. Soon thereafter, her father discovered The Well of Loneliness in a pile of other things in her bedroom. He was so appalled at what he found that he instructed her to burn the book, but did so in a letter as he was unable to speak to <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> face to face. Still eager to learn more about homosexuality, Gittings took a night course in abnormal psychology where she met a woman, with whom she had a brief affair, her first. At age 18, she left home to be on her own and moved to Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{realizes that}} {{although}} she has her dream job of salesman, she just might not be cut out for it after all since she makes few sales and very little money. A chance visit from a vendor gives her an idea to finagle a promotion to office administrator, hopefully for some added income. She informs Gabe of her promotion [...] "from a few months back" [...] and tells him {{she has not been}} paid accordingly, to which Gabe promises her he will get the missing wages if she can get all of the department heads to sign off on it. While she is busy convincing everyone that she has become the new administrator, Gabe catches on that she might be lying, and confronts <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Using a strategy she learned from watching poker, she stands her ground against Gabe and becomes de facto office administrator.|$|E

500|$|President Obama {{was visiting}} Australia and Indonesia when the {{discovery}} was made. Michelle Obama {{had returned to}} the White House on the morning of November 15, going to sleep shortly after arriving. An usher went to check on her later that day and began talking about the shooting, assuming she already knew about the incident. According to Leonnig, the first lady was [...] "furious", wondering why the director of the Secret Service, Mark J. Sullivan, who had accompanied her on her flight back to Washington, had not told <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Leonnig also stated that Sullivan was subsequently summoned to a meeting with the first lady, during which she [...] raised her voice so loudly she could be heard through the closed door. Sullivan disputes this report, though he declined to give any details regarding the conversation. A detailed inspection of the White House for evidence or damage and interviews with key witnesses began later that afternoon. Leonnig also stated that president Obama was angered over the flawed response and the failure to notify the first lady. According to one presidential aide, [...] "the shit really hit the fan" [...] when Obama returned from his travels five days later.|$|E
