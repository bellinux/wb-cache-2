5|$|The feudalism {{introduced}} under David <b>I,</b> <b>particularly</b> in {{the east}} and south where the crown's authority was greatest, saw the placement of lordships, often based on castles, and the creation of administrative sheriffdoms, which overlay the pattern of administration by local thanes. Land was now held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. It also saw the English earl and Latin comes begin to replace the mormaers in the records. However, the imposition of feudalism continued to sit beside existing system of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers. In places, feudalism may have tied workers more closely to the land, but the predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made the imposition of a manorial system, based on the English model, impracticable. Obligations appear to have been limited to occasional labour service, seasonal renders of food, hospitality and money rents.|$|E

Despite this, both the Virginia Cavaliers and Virginia Tech Hokies have been able to field competitive teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference and maintain modern facilities. Their rivalry is followed statewide. Twelve other universities compete in NCAA Division <b>I,</b> <b>particularly</b> in the Atlantic 10 Conference, Big South Conference, and Colonial Athletic Association. Three historically black schools compete in the Division II Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and two others compete in the Division I Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. Several smaller schools compete in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference and the USA South Athletic Conference of NCAA Division III. The NCAA currently holds its Division III championships in football, men's basketball, volleyball and softball in Salem.|$|E

500|$|The España {{class was}} a series of three {{dreadnought}} battleships built for the Spanish Navy between 1909 and 1921. The construction of the ships, particularly the third vessel, were significantly delayed due to shortages of materiel supplied by Great Britain during World War <b>I,</b> <b>particularly</b> armament. The class comprised España (Spain), Alfonso XIII, and Jaime I. The three ships were the only Spanish dreadnoughts ever built. They were also the smallest battleships of the type constructed, owing to the weak Spanish economy. The ships were armed with eight [...] guns, but their small displacement—only —forced the designers to compromise on armor protection and speed.|$|E
500|$|James Cameron had {{a fascination}} with shipwrecks, and, for him, the RMS Titanic was [...] "the Mount Everest of shipwrecks." [...] He was almost past the {{point in his life}} when he felt he could {{consider}} an undersea expedition, but said he still had [...] "a mental restlessness" [...] to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. So when an IMAX film was made from footage shot of the wreck itself, he decided to seek Hollywood funding to [...] "pay for an expedition and do the same thing." [...] It was [...] "not because <b>I</b> <b>particularly</b> wanted to make the movie," [...] Cameron said. [...] "I wanted to dive to the shipwreck." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Friend or Foe" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews.

[...] Mavis also praised the episode calling it [...] "brilliant" [...] because [...] " [...] Krabs and Plankton are strong enough characters, with their own mythology, that they can sustain their very own episode with only a cameo from SpongeBob." [...] He also said the episode is [...] "hilarious (I {{love the fact that}} it's a barely disguised version of Rashomon), with an especially funny look at Krabs, Plankton, and even SpongeBob, as babies." ...|$|E

500|$|Current {{scholarship}} has identified a single book as having belonged to Netley Abbey; {{it is now}} conserved as Arundel Ms. 69 in the British Library, London. The volume [...] has an inscription, added in the 15th century on folio 265v: [...] "Codex iste pertinet ad domum sancte Marie de Netteley" [...] ("This codex (i.e. a book not a scroll) belongs {{to the house of}} Saint Mary of Netteley"). The volume itself is a Latin manuscript executed in the 13th century, a copy of Roger of Hoveden's Chronica ("Chronicles"). [...] Roger (died c. 1201) was an English historian of the reigns of [...] Henry II and [...] Richard <b>I</b> <b>particularly</b> important for his account of the years 1148-1170. Little is known in detail about his life, but he may have been a priest and was a courtier to [...] Henry II, and accompanied [...] Richard I to the Holy Land on the Third Crusade and [...] served as a local justice in the north of England, and more generally as a negotiator between the crown and various barons and monastic houses.|$|E
500|$|As [...] "Kenny", {{as he was}} {{sometimes}} known, grew, he did an increasing share of the farm work, later stating, [...] "I did my share—and it was a substantial share—in {{taking care of the}} 13acres... I do not remember that <b>I</b> <b>particularly</b> liked to get up at 3:30 in the morning." [...] Kenesaw began his off-farm career at age ten as a news delivery boy. [...] He left school at 15 after an unsuccessful attempt to master algebra; he then worked at the local general store. He left that job for a position as errand boy with the Vandalia Railroad. Landis applied for a job as a brakeman, but was laughingly dismissed as too small. He then worked for the Logansport Journal, and taught himself shorthand reporting, becoming in 1883 official court reporter for the Cass County Circuit Court. [...] Landis later wrote, [...] "I may not have been much of a judge, nor baseball official, but I do pride myself on having been a real shorthand reporter." [...] He served in that capacity until 1886. In his spare time, he became a prize-winning bicycle racer and played on and managed a baseball team. Offered a professional contract as a ballplayer, he turned it down, stating that he preferred to play for the love of the game.|$|E
500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and <b>I</b> <b>particularly</b> like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E

500|$|Connery's {{interpretation}} of the character differed considerably from Fleming's, being more promiscuous and cold blooded than the literary version. Connery described Bond as [...] "a complete sensualist—senses highly tuned, awake to everything, quite amoral. <b>I</b> <b>particularly</b> like him because he thrives on conflict". Academic James Chapman observed that for Dr. No, Connery's {{interpretation of}} the character, although not complete, showed the actor [...] "should be credited with having established a new style of performance: a British screen hero {{in the manner of}} an American leading man". In his second film, From Russia with Love, Connery looked less nervous and edgy; he gave [...] "a relaxed, wry performance of subtle wit and style". Pfeiffer and Worrall noted that Connery [...] "personified James Bond with such perfection that even Ian Fleming... admitted that it was difficult imagining anyone else in the part"; academic Jeremy Black agreed and declared that [...] "Connery made the role his own and created the Bond audience for the cinema". Black also observed that Connery gave the character a [...] "spare, pared-down character... inner bleakness along with the style". Connery played Bond with [...] "the right mix of cool charisma, violence and arrogance... against which all others are judged". Raymond Benson perceived that Connery [...] "embodies a ruggedness and an intense screen presence this transcends any preconceived notions about the character". Benson also noted that Bond was witty, but contains [...] "an assured toughness that epitomises the machismo male". Roger Moore agreed with Black and Benson, commenting that [...] "Sean was Bond. He created Bond. He embodied Bond and because of Sean, Bond became an instantly recognisable character the world over—he was rough, tough, mean and witty... he was a bloody good 007". However, despite his charm and virility, Connery was characteristically laconic in his delivery. Christopher Bray says of him that [...] "in his single-minded, laconic, mocking, self-sufficient vanity, Connery's Bond was the epitome of sixties consumer culture".|$|E
500|$|Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune praised Rick Heinrichs's {{production}} design and Jim Carrey {{for having a}} balanced performance as a scene stealer. Elder called the film [...] "exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy and bitingly subversive." [...] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post reasoned over a fellow film-goer's characterization of Count Olaf, [...] "Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. <b>I</b> <b>particularly</b> liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur." [...] Ty Burr, writing in The Boston Globe, observed, [...] "Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling's not a hack like Chris Columbus, and Snicket has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two Harry Potter films. The film's no masterpiece, but at least you're {{in the hands of}} people who know what they're doing. The movie, like the books, flatters children's innate sense that the world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something. How you deal with the cognitive dissonance of a $125 million Hollywood picture telling you this is up to you. At least there are no Lemony Snicket Happy Meals. Yet." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that [...] "the film is first and foremost a fantasy, but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events manages to remain witty throughout." [...] Roger Ebert gave a mixed review: [...] "Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, but I suppose a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I'll tell you what. I think this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked. The original Spider-Man was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made Spider-Man 2, the best superhero movie ever made." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, [...] "A Series of Unfortunate Events suggests what Mary Poppins might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly, Burton's longtime {{production design}}er Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets, while ace Emmanuel Lubezki (Burton's Sleepy Hollow) contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes." ...|$|E

She wrote {{instructions}} for her funeral during an illness in 1841 at Sudbury Hall: [...] "I die in all humility", she wrote, [...] "we are alike before the throne of God, and I request therefore that my mortal remains be conveyed to the grave without pomp or state…to have as private and quiet a funeral as possible. <b>I</b> <b>particularly</b> desire not to be laid out in state…I die in peace and wish to be carried to the fount in peace, and free from the vanities and pomp of this world." ...|$|E

2500|$|A sequel {{went into}} {{development}} {{after the first}} game proved a critical and commercial success, but it was cancelled when Computer Artworks went into receivership in October 2003. According to Diarmid Campbell, [...] "we had the contract in place to make the sequel and were pretty excited about it. We had a very cool prototype of 'dynamic infection' and some really imaginative thing 'burst-outs'. <b>I</b> <b>particularly</b> liked the one where the person would split in half and their top half would jump to the ceiling and start swinging around like an orangutan with his intestines turned into tentacles." [...] However, the project never developed beyond the proof of concept stage, with Computer Artworks producing some concept art, showing locations and enemies, and two short demo videos, but nothing else.|$|E

[...] In the end, the NDP gained 8 new seats, taking its tally to 37. This result still left the NDP as Canada's fourth party, behind the Bloc Québécois with 50.

2500|$|Sharon Knolle of TV Squad stated [...] "From the {{inspired}} 'Tik Tok' musical opening sequence to {{the last}} gag, 'To Surveil With Love' {{ranks as one of}} the best 'Simpsons' episodes in years. I never expected the rest of the episode to live up to that killer opening, but, unbelievably, it just got better as it went along." [...] Todd VanDer Werff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- and said [...] "I thought this was a strong episode of The Simpsons. I laughed frequently throughout, I thought both of the major storylines mostly made sense and concluded well, and I enjoyed some of the ways the episode turned satire on its ear. <b>I</b> <b>particularly</b> liked the idea of Lisa conforming by becoming a brunette after everyone made fun of her for being a blonde. Dumb blonde jokes are as old as time itself, but the way the episode turned the whole thing into a sly parody of diversity and conformity was winning." ...|$|E
