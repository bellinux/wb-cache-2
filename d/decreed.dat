50|$|Amyraldian {{hypothetical}} universalism, {{associated with}} John Cameron and Moïse Amyraut, differs by asserting that God <b>decrees</b> {{the election of}} some to salvation logically subsequent to the <b>decree</b> to provide salvation through Christ. This represents a change to the traditional infralapsarian scheme of the logical order of God's <b>decrees,</b> where God's <b>decree</b> to save some was conceived of as logically preceding his <b>decree</b> to provide salvation. It is the same order as that advocated by Jacobus Arminius and his followers, though Amyraldians differed from Arminians by asserting {{that there are two}} phases to God's <b>decree</b> to save some. First, God <b>decrees</b> the salvation of all through Christ, but this <b>decree</b> is ineffectual because some people do not have faith. God then <b>decrees</b> that some will have faith and be saved.|$|R

The study also provides an account of the Brown v.

The Chicago Public Schools Policy Manual, official reports of the proceedings of the Board of Education of the City of Chicago, and transcripts from the signing of the Original, Modified, and Second Amended versions of the Consent <b>Decree</b> served as valuable primary resources to support this study.

5|$|Andronicus' {{rule was}} marked by {{incompetence}} and short-sighted decisions {{that in the long}} run would damage the Byzantine Empire beyond repair.

To popularize his rule he repudiated the union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches <b>decreed</b> by the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, thereby further increasing hostilities between the Latins and the Byzantines.|$|E
