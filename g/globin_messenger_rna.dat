Using a mouse cell line infected with Friend leukemia virus, T- 3 -Cl- 2, which can be induced to accumulate mouse-globin messenger RNA, we show that mouse-globin messenger RNA sequences are present in viral particles purified from the culture medium of globin-producing cells. These <b>globin</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> sequences are absent from viral particles derived from T- 3 -Cl- 2 cells that are not producing <b>globin</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA.</b> Virus-associated <b>globin</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> sequences sediment {{in association with the}} 60 S viral RNA complex as well as in free, 9 S form.

The specificity of the globin complementary DNA in annealing reactions was verified by preparing DNA complementary to liver messenger RNA and showing that the globin and liver complementary DNAs are specific for their own messenger RNAs. Both DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II from sheep liver and RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli can transcribe <b>globin</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> sequences from rabbit bone-marrow chromatin; however, the mammalian enzyme appears to be more specific in that globin gene sequences represent a higher proportion of the RNA synthesized.

The RNA was {{extracted from}} immature erythrocytes of ducks and fractionated under denaturing conditions by sucrose {{density gradient centrifugation}} in 99 % dimethylsulfoxide. The RNA sedimenting faster than 45 S was able to direct the synthesis of duck globins in the Krebs II ascites cell-free protein-synthesizing system. The newly synthesized globin molecules have been identified by their characteristic electrophoretic properties in polyacrylamide gels containing either urea or sodium dodecyl sulfate, and by immunoprecipitation of the released globin chains by rabbit antibodies against duck hemoglobin.

Under the conditions employed, no significant in situ hybridization occurred to lymphoma cells (L 51787), mouse L cells, or hepatocytes; whereas reticulocytes from phenyl hydrazine-treated mice showed extensive in situ hybridization. The proportion of fetal liver cells showing predominantly cytoplasmic in situ hybridization increased from about 30 % at the 1 lth day of development to 80 - 85 % by days 13 - 15. Unlike more mature cells, proerythroblasts did not show in situ hybridization, except to a slight extent at later stages of development.

40|$|In human reticulocytes, the {{critical}} balancing of a- and fl-globin synthesis may be controlled {{in part by}} differential translation {{of the three major}} adult <b>globin</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> (mRNAs), al, a 2, and ft. In this study, we determined, as a parameter of trans-lational efficiency, the relative ribosome loading of these three mRNAs. Using oligonucleotide probes specific for the al- and a 2 -globin mRNAs, we find that these two mRNAs have identical translational profiles. Their distribution contrasts with that of j 3 -globin mRNA, which is present on heavier polyribosomes and is less prevalent in pre- 8 OS messenger ribonucleoprotein frac-tions. The relative distribution of a- vs. 13 -globin mRNA is con-sistent with more efficient ft-globin translation. In contrast, the parallel distributions of al- and a 2 -globin mRNAs suggests they are translated with equal efficiencies.

Plasmids carrying globin sequences were identified by hybridization of 32 P-labelled globin mRNA to total cellular DNA in situ, by hybridization of purified plasmids to globin cDNA in solution, by analysis of recombinant DNA on polyacrylamide and agarose gels, and by heteroduplex mapping.

Patients with hemoglobin (Hb) E-beta-thalassemia exhibit clinical phenotypes of severe beta-thalassemia, a circumstance not encountered in other compound heterozygous states for structural beta-chain mutations and beta-thalassemia. We have analyzed the kinetics of globin synthesis and the levels of <b>globin</b> <b>messenger</b> (m) <b>RNA</b> accumulation in patients with Hb E-beta-thalassemia and Hb E trait. The initial rate of beta-globin synthesis (betaE/alpha= 0. 20 - 0. 34) was less than expected {{on the basis of}} gene dosage, or comparable studies of other compound heterozygous states for beta-thalassemia and structurally abnormal beta-chains. betaE-globin synthesis was not only reduced during short-term incubations (1 - 5 min), but also remained relatively unchanged during long-term pulse or chase incubations up to 5 h. Analysis of globin mRNA by cell-free translation and molecular hybridization confirmed that the unexpectedly low levels of betaE-globin synthesis were associated with comparable reduction in the levels of beta-globin mRNA. In Hb E-beta-thalassemia the betaA + betaE (alpha globin nRNA ratio observed were substantially lower than those obtained from reticulocytes of patients with heterozygous beta-thalassemia, or Hb S-betaO-thalassemia, while in Hb E trait, the betaA + betaE/alpha mRNA ratio was in the ranged observed for beta-thalassemia trait. The betaE-globin gene specifies reduced accumulation of betaE-globin mRNA, a property characteristic of other forms of beta-thalassemia. The beta-thalassemia phenotype associated with inheritance of Hb E is thus determined at the level of beta-globin mRNA metabolism...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine fetal gene {{expression}} in maternal plasma after fetoscopic intervention for twin-twin transfusion syndrome or congenital diaphragmatic hernia. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve women with pregnancies that were complicated by twin-twin transfusion syndrome and 10 women carrying fetuses with congenital diaphragmatic hernia were sampled before and sequentially after treatment. Levels of glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, human placental lactogen, and gamma <b>globin</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> were measured by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification. RESULTS: At all time points, glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase messenger RNA levels were higher in the congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases than in the twin-twin transfusion syndrome cases (P <. 05), but during the immediate postoperative observation period, there were no significant changes in glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, human placental lactogen, or gamma <b>globin</b> <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> levels in individual patients or patients who were grouped by procedure. CONCLUSION: Fetoscopic intervention of complicated pregnancies does not affect circulating fetal messenger RNA levels, which is in contrast to earlier observations that circulating fetal DNA levels increase after laser ablation for twin-twin transfusion syndrome.

While the most abundant β-amyloid precursor protein <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> in the brain of all three species under study were, in descending order, β-amyloid precursor protein 695 and β-amyloid precursor protein 751 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs,</b> the least abundant form was not the same for all species: in human it was β-amyloid precursor protein 714 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> and in rat and mouse brain it was β-amyloid precursor protein 770 <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA.</b> Our results show differences both inter- and intraspecies of the relative abundance and distribution of four β-amyloid precursor protein <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> in rat, mouse and human brain. The non-coincidence of the distribution of β-amyloid precursor protein <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> isoforms suggests different physiological functions for the β-amyloid precursor proteins. Interspecies differences should be considered when comparing results from animal and human studies.
