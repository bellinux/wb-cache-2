After seeing The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen, Løvold started working to build a mermaid statue fountain in Kristiansund. The mermaid statue was never built, although he eventually secured sufficient funding to build a fountain. Løvold traveled to the United States in 1951 to visit his siblings Oscar and Lise in Minnesota, which he had not seen in 42 years. He also visited New York City, where he drove through the Holland Tunnel. On his way home he came in contact with Prime Minister Oscar Torp.|$|E
5|$|The {{nationalisation}} of the AESC was {{the most}} prominent manifestation of Playford's economic pragmatism; although ideologically a supporter of free enterprise like his colleagues, he saw ideology as secondary if {{in the way of}} his objectives. He had little time for those who objected to plans that were <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>betterment</b> <b>of</b> South Australia, despite these plans being contrary to particular interpretations of party ideology. The struggle for Leigh Creek was seen as a critical point in Playford's premiership; a second legislative failure was seen as being potentially fatal for Playford's leadership of his party, but the successful passage of the bill enhanced his image and gave himi enduring control over his party for the rest of his career, although it angered some of the staunch LCL conservatives in the upper house for some time; a significant number of them refused to talk to Playford for a substantial period of time thereafter.|$|E
