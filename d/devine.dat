5|$|Jay Lethal {{defended the}} TNA X Division Championship against Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Johnny <b>Devine,</b> Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt in the 2008 TNA Xscape match {{to open the}} event. In this match, the six {{competitors}} fought until four were eliminated by pinfall or submission; the two remaining wrestlers then fought {{to escape from the}} cage, with the first to do so the winner. The duration of the contest was 10 minutes and 45 seconds. Dutt was the first eliminated in the bout by <b>Devine</b> with a roll-up pin at 2 minutes and 50 seconds. The second was Shark Boy at 4 minutes and 30 seconds, after Creed performed his signature Creed-DT maneuver. At 7 minutes and 15 seconds, Creed was eliminated by Curry Man after his signature Spice Rack maneuver. Curry Man was the last eliminated at 8 minutes and 40 seconds by <b>Devine</b> following his signature <b>Devine</b> Intervention maneuver. With the match down to two competitors, <b>Devine</b> and Lethal fought to escape the cage. Lethal escaped the cage first, thus winning the match and retaining the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match to}} {{take place on the}} event's card was the Six Man Tag Team Tables match pitting the team of Johnny <b>Devine</b> and Team 3D against the team of Jay Lethal and MCMG. The match lasted {{fourteen}} minutes and fifty-nine seconds. The objective of a Six Man Tag Team Tables match is to drive {{one of the members of}} the opposing team through a table. During the contest, Lethal drove <b>Devine</b> through a table with a driving elbow drop. However, as the referee was scripted to appear unconscious, this allowed Team 3D to knockout MCMG and Lethal with the X Division Championship belt. They followed by draping <b>Devine</b> over Lethal, making it appear as though <b>Devine</b> had drove Lethal through the table, thus winning the match for his team.|$|E

5|$|A Six Man Tag Team Ultimate X match pitting {{the teams}} of Johnny <b>Devine</b> and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) against Jay Lethal and The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) (MCMG) was another {{featured}} match on the card. This match {{was the result}} of Team 3D's feud with the TNA X Division. In October 2007, Team 3D began a storyline in which they were trying to eliminate the X Division. MCMG became their rivals in the thread with MCMG defeating Team 3D at Genesis. TNA X Division Champion Lethal later joined MCMG in the fight; around the same time, <b>Devine</b> turned on the division and joined Team 3D. The teams then fought in a Six Man Tag Team Tables match at Turning Point, which <b>Devine</b> and Team 3D won. The two teams fought again on the December 6, 2007 episode of Impact! in a Six Man Tag Team Ladder match, which <b>Devine</b> and Team 3D won. On the December 20, 2007 episode of Impact!, Lethal and MCMG defeated <b>Devine</b> and Team 3D in a Double North Pole match to determine the stipulation to their match at Final Resolution; choosing an Ultimate X match over a Plate glass Tables match. On the January 3, 2008 episode of Impact!, Team 3D attacked and injured MCMG in the storyline by beating their hands with kendo sticks.|$|E
5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) {{challenged}} Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young), {{who were}} accompanied by Coach D'Amore, for the NWA World Tag Team Championship in the seventh match. Johnny <b>Devine</b> interfered midway through by hitting Storm with a kendo stick, {{which led to a}} pinfall attempt by Young, however Stormed kicked out at two. Later, Young went to grab a chair from <b>Devine</b> who had his back turned to the ring. This caused <b>Devine</b> to panic and hit Young in the head with the chair. Storm immediately followed by grabbing Young and pinning his shoulders to the mat with a school boy type pin attempt for the victory.|$|E

5|$|Team 3D and MCMG {{continued}} their rivalry heading into Turning Point, with MCMG now joined by Lethal. On the November 15 episode of Impact!, Johnny <b>Devine,</b> an X Division wrestler, betrayed and attacked MCMG and Lethal, joining Team 3D in the process. This {{led to the}} six meeting in a Six Man Tag Team Tables match at Turning Point. Team 3D and <b>Devine</b> {{went on to win}} the contest.|$|E
5|$|Team 3D's {{feud with}} the X Division {{continued}} into Final Resolution. The two teams fought {{again on the}} December 6, 2007 episode of Impact! in a Six Man Tag Team Ladder match, which Johnny <b>Devine</b> and Team 3D won. On the December 20, 2007 episode of Impact!, Jay Lethal and MCMG defeated <b>Devine</b> and Team 3D in a Double North Pole match to determine the stipulation to their match at Final Resolution; choosing an Ultimate X match over a Plate glass Tables match. On the January 3, 2008 episode of Impact!, Team 3D attacked and injured MCMG in the storyline by beating their hands with kendo sticks, which {{made it hard to}} compete in an Ultimate X match in storyline. At Final Resolution, <b>Devine</b> and Team 3D won the bout. The feud came to an end at Against All Odds, where Lethal and MCMG defeated <b>Devine</b> and Team 3D in a Street Fight to save the X Division from disbandment.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{the first}} record of <b>Devine's</b> made that is fully backed by a band (previous albums {{typically}} feature at least one acoustic song) and his fourth produced by Chris Bracco (Bracco co-produced <b>Devine's</b> Make the Clocks Move and Split the Country, Split the Street with Mike Skinner and produced 2009's Brother's Blood). The album was mixed by Rob Schnapf, who produced <b>Devine's</b> 2006 album Put Your Ghost to Rest and the 2008 single Another Bag of Bones.

5|$|The Six Man Tag Team Street Fight {{between the}} team of Jay Lethal and MCMG (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) and {{the team of}} Johnny <b>Devine</b> and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). The {{stipulation}}s were if Lethal and MCMG won then Team 3D {{would be forced to}} work with a weight limit, while if <b>Devine</b> and Team 3D won the TNA X Division would dissemble. Another added stipulation before the contest was whoever gained the pinfall would win the TNA X Division Championship. It lasted twelve minutes and thirty seconds. A Street Fight is fought under no disqualification and no count-out rules, with weapons legal and provided for the match. During the final minutes, both Sabin and Shelley were scripted to appear unconscious at ringside, which caused Lethal to have to fight off <b>Devine</b> and Team 3D alone. Near the end of the match Team 3D set up a table; Lethal followed by sending both out of the ring and laying <b>Devine</b> over the table. Lethal then stood {{on the top of a}} padded turnbuckle and jumped off to perform an elbow drop on <b>Devine</b> through the table to win the match. With the victory, Lethal won the TNA X Division Championship, prevented the X Division from disbanding, and forced Team 3D to work with a weight limit in the company.|$|E
5|$|A National Army relief column {{including}} the detachments under Husher, Fleetwood and <b>Devine</b> assembled at Lurkers' Ridge {{during the morning}} of 12 February. Under the command of Captain Tony Clark, it flanked through the townships south of the Alamo, engaging ZIPRA guerrillas along the way, then turned north to relieve Dyck. The Elands led the way, with <b>Devine</b> himself standing upright in the turret {{of one of them}} with a machine gun. At one point this was shot out of his hands, prompting him to briefly stop the advance so he could jump down into the street to collect it. By the time the relief column reached the Alamo at 13:00, C Company had been pocketed for 16 hours. Four wounded 1RAR soldiers were evacuated, and Dyck left the building to point out targets for Devine's armoured cars. During the afternoon, A Company relieved D Company at Lurker's Ridge, and the ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas withdrew into the townships and the surrounding country, sporadically exchanging fire. <b>Devine</b> was sent to Essexvale to engage the rest of ZIPRA's armoured battle group, which surrendered when he arrived; the T-34 tanks were later found by the Zimbabwe National Army to be nonfunctional. By the evening of 12 February, the rebellion was over.|$|E
5|$|Next was the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament finals for {{the vacant}} TNA World Tag Team Championship between LAX, {{accompanied}} by Guerrero and Salinas, and Team 3D. The duration was eleven minutes and thirty seconds. <b>Devine</b> tried {{to interfere in}} the contest by setting up a table for Team 3D, but Guerrero stopped him {{and set up the}} table for himself outside the ring, placing <b>Devine</b> on top. Guerrero then climbed a padded turnbuckle and jumped onto <b>Devine</b> with a diving foot stomp, forcing him through the table. In the ring, Team 3D performed one of their signature tag team maneuvers, the 3D II, forcing Homicide into the mat and following with a cover, but the referee refused to count because Homicide was not the legal man in the contest. Hernandez then performed his signature Border Toss maneuver on Devon, slamming him into the mat from the top of a turnbuckle. Homicide followed with a splash from the top of a padded turnbuckle on Devon for the pinfall victory, winning the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament and the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{fighting}} {{broke out}} between ZANLA and ZIPRA {{members of a}} recently integrated Zimbabwe National Army battalion at Ntabazinduna, just north-east of Bulawayo, the two guerrilla camps at Entumbane began exchanging rifle, machine gun and mortar fire at about 20:00 on 11 February. Dyck, at the Alamo, reported that both sides were also attacking his position. He radioed Brigade HQ for instructions and was told to pull out; he replied that this was impossible as he was surrounded. At Shute's orders, McKenna mobilised {{the rest of the}} battalion at an airfield near Brady Barracks within an hour. Meanwhile, a detachment of ZIPRA armoured vehicles left Essexvale for Bulawayo, and was spotted on the road by one of McKenna's observation posts. <b>Devine</b> was sent with his Elands to intercept them, supported by 12 1RAR men under Major Tony Husher. At an intersection {{on the outskirts of the}} city, <b>Devine</b> encountered a ZIPRA BTR-152 APC and impacted it with a single high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round, killing all 20 combatants inside. McKenna then told <b>Devine</b> to advance to the city limits, where he and Husher set up an ambush on the road. Husher's men shot out all nearby overhead street lights, and some of them went to scout ahead; <b>Devine</b> positioned two of his Elands on each of the two lanes of the road under cover of darkness.|$|E

Before the match, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that the winner would take Kurt Angle's place in the main event, {{in addition to being}} the TNA X Division Championship number one contender. In this match, the ring was surrounded by a giant red steel barred cage with a domed roof. The wrestlers were to compete as they climbed up the side to a hole {{in the center of the}} ceiling; the first to escape the cage would win. While <b>Devine</b> was attempting to escape, Kaz intervened and caused <b>Devine</b> to fall from the ceiling into a group of wrestlers huddled in the center of the ring. Kaz then climbed out of the hole to win the contest at ten minutes and forty five seconds.|$|E
5|$|The main storyline in TNA's X Division {{revolved}} around Team 3D's (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) attempt {{to eliminate the}} X Division.
