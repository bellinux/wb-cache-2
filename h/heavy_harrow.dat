Each depth resembled the compactation caused by the constant use of rotovator, light harrow, <b>heavy</b> <b>harrow</b> and disk plough, tools that are commonly used by formers in tillage operations in "La Sabana de Bogota". To test the influence of depth of compaction a split plot design experiment was used in which the main plot was the depth of compaction and the subplots the type of vegetables (cabbage, silver beet and carrots). The depth of the compacted layer had a big influence in the yields of all the tested vegetables. Assuming that the 30 cm depth of compacted layer produced 100 percent, when it was 5 cm the relative yields decreased down to 38, 32 and 22 percent for the same crops respectively, showing the negative influence of oompaction, which affects soil water storage capacity and nutrient absorption by reducing the available soil volume for rooting...|$|E

Este trabalho avaliou os efeitos dos sistemas de preparo sobre as propriedades químicas e físicas do solo, em um experimento instalado em 1985. A área {{experimental}} vem sendo cultivada com culturas anuais em seis sistemas de preparo: semeadura direta (SD), arado de discos (AD), arado de aivecas (AA), grade pesada (GP), grade pesada + arado de discos (GP + AD) e grade pesada + arado de aivecas (GP + AA). O delineamento utilizado foi de blocos completos casualizados, com quatro repetições. As amostragens foram realizadas após a cultura do milho (safra 2001 / 02), nas profundidades de 0 - 5, 5 - 10 e 10 - 20 cm. As amostras de solo foram submetidas às análises químicas e físicas e as médias comparadas pelo teste de Tukey. Os sistemas de preparo influíram nas propriedades químicas e físicas do solo, com a maior parte das diferenças ocorrendo entre a SD e os demais sistemas. A densidade do solo foi superior na SD, em relação à dos demais tratamentos. Houve incremento nos valores de MO, pH, CTC efetiva, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K e P, na camada superficial da SD, em relação às demais profundidades. A semeadura direta apresentou valores de Al 3 + inferiores aos dos demais tratamentos, na camada de 0 - 5 cm de profundidade, e superiores aos dos tratamentos AD, GP e GP + AA, na camada de 10 - 20 cm.

40|$|Tillage {{involves}} great expense {{for many}} farmers today. Lowering machinery costs, fuel consumption and working hours per hectare can reduce total costs. However, {{this must be}} achieved without compromising the results of tillage. In a project {{carried out in the}} autumn of 2003, draught requirement and tillage outcomes were compared for different tillage implements during autumn sowing on a light soil and a heavy soil. The tillage implements used were mouldboard plough, shallow plough, stubble cultivator, heavy duty stubble cultivator with wing shares, tandem disc <b>harrow</b> and <b>heavy</b> disc <b>harrow</b> designed for shallow tillage. Except for the mouldboard plough, one and two passes were investigated for each implement. After primary tillage, the seedbed was prepared with a disc harrow for shallow tillage and a roller adapted for cultivation. Seed was drilled using a combi-drill with discs for shallow tillage. For each implement the fuel consumption was measured using an adapted tractor (Massey Ferguson 6290) with equipment for measuring fuel consumption. The equipment was calibrated to give the PTO effect for any combination of fuel consumption and engine speed. This effect was assumed to be equal to the effect available at the wheels. The drawbar power was calculated by subtracting power losses through wheel slip and rolling resistance. The draught requirement was calculated by dividing the drawbar power by the actual speed, which was measured during work. The actual working depth was calculated by measuring bulk density before tillage and then weighing the cultivated soil from a specific area. On the basis of the tillage depth, the working width and the draught requirements, it was possible to calculate the specific draught (force per cross-sectional tilled area, kN/m 2). The draught per metre working width (kN/m) was also calculated and used to calculate the fuel consumption per hectare for the different systems. Some of the cultivated soil from each line was sieved into different fractions, allowing the approximate surface area of the tilled soil (m 2 /kg) and the energy requirement for fracturing (J/m 2) to be calculated. After drilling, the soil surface was photographed and the images were analysed to calculate how much of the soil surface was covered with straw from the previous crop. To make a fair comparison of draught between different tillage implements, the actual working depth must be taken into consideration. The pre-set working depth is not an adequate parameter because the different implements do not leave equally uniform tillage bases. Therefore they till different volumes of soil at a particular pre-set working depth. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough nearly always worked to the pre-set depth while the other implements always tilled to a shallower level than the pre-set depth. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough had the lowest specific draught requirement. On the light soil, the specific draught did not differ much between the other implements. On the heavy soil, however, the specific draught was highest for the stubble cultivator and the heavy duty stubble cultivator with wing shares. The specific draught for the second pass was higher than that for the first pass for each implement because the actual working depth became very shallow. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough were least effective at fracturing the soil, while there was little difference between the other implements. However, the tandem disc <b>harrow</b> and the <b>heavy</b> disc <b>harrow</b> designed for shallow tillage fractured the soil most effectively. The fracturing did not increase much after the second pass with any of the implements. The mouldboard plough and the shallow plough buried the straw best, while the direct drilling treatment left most straw on the soil surface. The differences between the other implements were low. The second pass did not seem to decrease the amount of straw on the soil surface. The tillage systems with the mouldboard plough and the shallow plough consumed the most fuel. Much of the fuel used in the overall tillage process is consumed in seedbed preparation. Both the tillage systems with the plough required more seedbed preparation than the other systems {{and that was one of}} the reasons why the fuel consumption was higher. The direct drilling system required the lowest amount of fuel. Of all the cultivation systems, those with one pass with the tandem disc <b>harrow</b> and the <b>heavy</b> disc <b>harrow</b> for shallow tillage consumed the least fuel. On the basis of all the parameters studied here, it is hard to identify an optimal tillage system. The choice depends on the prevailing conditions in the field in question. If there is a large amount of straw from the previous crop that is likely to cause problems, the mouldboard plough or the shallow plough are preferable because in such cases it is important to bury the straw well and this can justify the higher fuel consumption. The results of this study show that shallow ploughing (~ 11 cm) with either of the two ploughs requires a lower amount of fuel, fractures the soil better and buries the straw as well as deep ploughing (~ 20 cm). If the straw from the previous crop is not a problem, the system with the <b>heavy</b> disc <b>harrow</b> for shallow tillage or the heavy duty stubble cultivator with wing shares is preferable since both these implements give high soil fracturing and slicing across the entire working width, killing weeds effectively...|$|R

In this study, we evaluated the effect of soil tillage and of amounts of plant residue on surface roughness of an Oxisol under simulated rain.

O presente trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar a qualidade do processo de colheita mecanizada de cana-de-açúcar crua, utilizando o controle estatístico do processo (CEP), e a capacidade do processo gerar resultados dentro dos limites especificados, por meio da análise de capabilidade, quantificando as perdas e os danos causados às soqueiras pelo mecanismo de corte basal. O experimento foi conduzido em área de ARGISSOLO Amarelo, localizada no município de Arez – RN, sob dois tipos manejos do solo, no sistema convencional de preparo. Os tratamentos foram: AR+GM (arado de aivecas + grade média); GP+GM (grade pesada + grade média) e as perdas determinadas por meio de amostragem. Os atributos do tipo rebolo repicado, toco e totais diferiram estatisticamente entre os tratamentos estudados, sendo os maiores valores de perdas quantificados para o tratamento que utilizou o arado de aivecas seguido de grade média. O processo de colheita apresenta-se fora de controle para os atributos do tipo rebolo repicado, cana inteira, cana-ponta, pedaço fixo, pedaço solto, lasca e estilhaço. O tratamento arado de aivecas seguido de grade média apresenta maiores graus de danos ocasionados às soqueiras, comparado ao tratamento (GP+GM). O tratamento (AR+GM) apresenta maior área de microrrelevo, diferindo estatisticamente do tratamento preparado com grade pesada seguida de grade média. The mechanized {{harvest of}} sugar cane {{is relevant to}} the whole productive process of the crop, including {{the quality of the}} final product that is delivered for processing at the plant. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the quality of the process of the mechanized harvest of raw sugar cane by means of statistical process control, and also the capacity of the process to generate results within the specified limits through the analysis of capability, quantifying the losses and damages caused to the stalks (ratoon) by the mechanism of the cutting base. The experiment was conducted in an area of yellow clay soil located in the municipal of Arez, RN, Brazil, using two methods of managing the soil within the conventional system of preparation. The treatments were: (a) moldboard ploughs followed by average weight offset disc <b>harrow</b> and; (b) <b>heavy</b> offset disc <b>harrow</b> followed by average weight offset disc harrow, with the losses being determined through samples. The losses attributed to splinted stalks, pieces and stubble total differed statistically between the treatments studied, being that the highest values of quantified losses came from the treatment using moldboard ploughs followed by average weight offset disc harrow. The harvesting process proved unmanageable due to splinted stalks, whole cane, cane points, fixed pieces, loose pieces and splinters. The treatment using moldboard ploughs followed by average weight offset disc harrow presented the highest degree of damage to the stalks when compared to treatment (b). The treatment (a) presented the largest area of microrelief, differing statistically from the treatment using <b>heavy</b> offset disc <b>harrow</b> followed by average weight offset disc harrow...|$|R
40|$|O processo erosivo é a {{principal}} causa de degradação dos solos, trazendo, como consequência, prejuízos ao setor agrícola e ao meio ambiente, com reflexos econômicos e também sociais. Este trabalho foi realizado com o objetivo de avaliar as perdas de solo e nutrientes em diferentes sistemas de preparo num Latossolo Vermelho-Amarelo ácrico típico. Foram instaladas cinco parcelas experimentais contendo os seguintes tratamentos: preparo convencional e cultivo morro abaixo (CMA); preparo convencional e plantio em nível (CEN); preparo com uma grade aradora e uma niveladora e plantio em nível (CNiv); preparo com duas gradagens niveladoras, plantio em nível (NA) e cultivo mínimo em nível (CMN). As perdas de solo foram determinadas pelo método direto durante o ciclo da cultura de algodão, de dezembro de 2005 a junho de 2006. A cada coleta foram retiradas amostras de solo para quantificar as perdas dos nutrientes N, P, K e carbono orgânico (C-org) nos sedimentos. A diminuição no revolvimento do solo proporcionou menores perdas de sedimento, nutrientes e C-org, destacando o CMN como o mais eficiente. As perdas de N, P, K e C-org nos sedimentos apresentaram tendências semelhantes às das perdas de solo, e N, P e K variaram conforme as adubações utilizadas. O C-org foi encontrado em maior quantidade no sedimento. A taxa de infiltração básica (TIB) expressou diferença entre os tratamentos na seguinte ordem em valores crescentes: CMA CNiv NA Erosion {{is the main}} cause of soil degradation, and it leads to adverse effects to agriculture and environment, with social and economic implications. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate soil and nutrient losses in different soil tillage systems in a typic Acric Red-Yellow Latosol (Oxisol). On five plots with the following soil tillage treatments were evaluated: conventional tillage and down-slope tillage (CMA); conventional tillage and contour seeding (CEN); tillage with one passage of <b>heavy</b> disk <b>harrow</b> and one passage of leveling harrow and contour seeding (CNiv); tillage with two passages of leveling harrow and contour seeding (NA) and no tillage and contour seeding (CMN). The soil losses were determined by the direct method during the cotton crop cycle, from December 2005 to June 2006. Along each runoff sampling, soil samples were withdrawn to quantify the losses of N, P, K and organic carbon (C-org) in the sediments. Decreasing soil tillage lessened the losses of sediments, nutrients and organic carbon, indicating that the CMN treatment was the most efficient. The trends for N, P, K and C-org losses in the sediments were similar to the soil losses. N, P and K varied according to the fertilizers used. The constituent with the highest concentration in the sediment was C in organic compounds. The basic infiltration rate differed among the treatments in the following order: CMA CNiv NA < CMN, indicating that tillage systems that reduced soil revolving and increased organic C, increased the basic infiltration rate and decreased soil erosion...|$|R
40|$|Shallow {{cultivation}} to a {{depth of}} 5 - 7 cm has in the last years become a realistic alternative to common ploughless tillage (cultivation depth 1 0 - 15 cm), especially in Great Britain, France and Germany. Shallow cultivation means avoiding unnecessary soil loosening, preserving the soils natural structure, increasing activity in the top layer and decreasing fuel consumption with less power requirement. Two years ago VäderstadVerken AB developed a tillage tool for shallow cultivation called Rexius Carrier with System Disc. The tool consists of a heavy roller and a front tool called Systern Disc. The front tool includes two rows of concave, close mounted discs, which combined with a trave 1 ing speed of 10 - 14 km/h leaves a well leveled, 100 % work through, top layer. The aim of this thesis was to test shallow cultivation with Rexius Carrier under Swedish conditions, as autumn cultivation and as spring cultivation after a catch crop. This thesis includes the results of three different series of field experiments. The first, "Minimized autumn tillage to a spring crop", R 2 - 4122, was started in the autumn 2000. The result of the trial showed the highest yield for mouldboard ploughing and the lowest for the shallow cultivation, with deeper ploughless tillage in between. The second series, "Spring seeding without autumn tillage, including a catch crop", R 2 - 4123, was started in the spring of 2001. The series contained three experiments on sites with different clay contents, and compared autumn and spring ploughing with ploughless tillage to different depths and with different tillage intensities. The shallow cultivation performed well in this comparison. Despite a less suitable seedbed, plant establishment and crop yield in the shallow cultivated plots was nearly as high as for autumn ploughing. The weed population was greatly reduced in the shallow cultivated plots. The spring ploughed plots had less sui 1 able seedbed properties, poorer germination, more weed and lower crop yield than autumn ploughed plots. The third series, "Shallow cultivation to winter seed", started in the autumn of 200 1. In this series conventional mouldboard ploughing was compared with shallow cultivation with Rexius Carrier, chisel ploughing with and without roller and <b>heavy</b> disc <b>harrow</b> with and without roller. Before the second cultivation the germination of weeds and volunteers was counted, without any differences between different treatments. Before the seeding, the amount of straw and stubble on the surface was compared using digital image analysis. No differences between the treatments were found. After the seeding, the seedbed properties and the plant establishment was determined. Due to the large amount of rain that fell in the autumn, which had an equalizing effect on the analyzed parameters, {{no significant differences between the}} treatments were found. The trials has shown that only shallow cultivation before seeding can give good opportunities for the following crop. The trial R 2 - 4123 showed that shallow spring cultivation after a catch crop can maintain harvest yield compared to conventional mouldboard ploughing. Shallow autumn cultivation has a future as an alternative to conventional methods. The plant establishment were quite comparable despite the large amount of rain that fell in the autumn...|$|R
