5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed <b>fire-retardant.</b> Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the fires, erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped millions of gallons of water on the fires, and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate-based <b>fire-retardant</b> material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E

40|$|To clarify how {{the fire}} {{performance}} of ultra-low density fiberboard (ULDF) {{can be improved}} by complex <b>fire-retardants,</b> the limiting oxygen index (LOI) and microstructure of ULDFs with different additive amounts of complex <b>fire-retardants</b> was analyzed. The char yield, chemical bonding, and thermostability of ULDFs treated by different temperatures were also tested. Results showed that the LOI values and compactness of ULDFs were increased with increased amounts of <b>fire-retardants.</b> Three steps of char yield curves in control fiberboard (CF) and mixed fiberboard (MF) were apparent. The preliminary degradation in lignin and cellulose of CF occurred at 300 °C. The cellulose had completely decomposed at 400 °C, {{but in the case}} of MF, the lignin and cellulose were not completely decomposed at 400 °C. It was shown that there are different ways to improve the fire resistance of ULDF using boron, nitrogen-phosphorus, silica, and halogen-based <b>fire-retardants.</b> The fiberboard with silicium compounds had the lowest mass loss in three stages and total mass loss. Compared with CF, MF had a lower mass loss. Furthermore, the exothermic peak for MF at around 400. 0 °C was decreased, indicating that the fire resistance of ULDF was improved by the complex <b>fire-retardants.</b>   Validerad; 2016; Nivå 2; 2016 - 12 - 01 (rokbeg) </p...|$|R

25|$|A plane {{en route}} to the island airport crashed in Lake Ontario in January 1987, during snow squalls. The plane sank, leaving its two {{occupants}} floating in the lake wear life jackets for an hour before rescue. The pilot died due to hypothermia, while the passenger survived. A crash inquiry was held into the circumstances of the crash. It was found that the rescue of the two occupants of the plane was delayed by communications problems in the notifications of appropriate search-and-rescue authorities. It also found, according to the airport's fire chief, that the island did not have enough fire equipment to put out a fire if a Dash 8 crashed. The revelation about the fire equipment prompted a debate at Toronto City Council about possibly closing the airport over safety concerns. Council had been assured that the airport was safe a year earlier, when the agreement to allow the Dash 8 was made with the city. The Government of Canada admitted that the island airport did not have enough fire equipment and <b>fire-retardant</b> foam. It only carried 650 litres of foam, when 5,500 litres was required according to the types of planes and numbers of flights occurring at the airport. The Government of Canada purchased a 6,700 litre capacity Walter 6000 firetruck and it was put into service in November 1987. 1987 saw an increase in takeoffs and landings at the airport, from 182,215 to 198,072.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The durable <b>fire-retardants</b> {{based on}} the {{colloidal}} solution of cationic aminotriazinealdehyde resin have been applied to HINOKI sliced veneer and filter paper. The treatment is accomplished by soaking samples through an aqueous solution of these resins, drying and curing at room temperatures. The effect of kind of acids and of varying ratio of fire retardant components in treat-ing solution on the fire proofing efficiencies of HINOKI sliced veneer and filter paper are discussed. Results are compared with those reported in previous paper 4 l and ammonium salts as fire retardant agents for wood, paper, fabrics and other combustible materials. Aminotria-zine-aldehyde condensation products combined with strong acids such as phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid and sulfamic acid imparted excellent fire resistance to wood and filter paper. Satisfactory fire proofing properties can be obtained in both HINOKI sliced veneer and filter paper at resin add-on as low as about 1 O~ 15 % with a few excep-tions. Total amount of resin required becomes lower as the melamine/acid ratio is de-creased...|$|R
40|$|Fire {{fighting}} retardants {{are rapidly}} gaining acceptance as {{effective and efficient}} tools by fire management agencies. Nevertheless, fire operators were alarmed by a blue layer developed on aluminum surface after the use of <b>fire-retardants</b> while few papers considered the corrosion effect of these products. The aim {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the corrosion behaviour of aluminium and steel alloys in contact with long term fire retardants (Fire Trol ® 931 and Fire Trol ® 936). New tests are carried out like electrochemical measurements to obtain accurate information regarding the corrosion rate of the materials within a short period of time. The aggressiveness is found to be dependant of the solution used: in Fire Trol ® 931 aluminium alloys showed better corrosion resistance than steel. On the contrary steel showed lower corrosion current in Trol ® 936 in particular at beginning time of immersion. In both cases, the anodic reaction of corrosion phenomenon favours the deposition of a Prussian blue layer on the surface. This layer reduces the corrosion phenomenon on both aluminium and steel alloys...|$|R
40|$|Many {{types of}} <b>fire-retardants</b> {{are used in}} poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET, formulations, and two {{commercial}} fire retardants, Ukanol(TM) and Phosgard(TM), {{have been shown to}} improve significantly PET flame-retardancy when used as comonomers. Phosgard incorporates a phosphorus atom within the main chain whereas Ukanol incorporates a phosphorus atom as a pendent substituent. Despite their acknowledged effectiveness, the mode of action of these fire retardants remains unclear, and in this paper we present a comparison of the overall thermal degradation behaviour of PET and Ukanol and Phosgard fire retarded formulations. DSC and particularly TGA data show that both Ukanol and Phosgard have some stabilising influence on PET degradation, especially under oxidative conditions. TGA and pyrolysis experiments both clearly indicate that neither additive acts as a char promoter. Only the Phosgard formulation shows any release of volatile phosphorus species which could act in the gas phase. On the other hand, the most striking feature of the pyrolysis experiments is the macroscopic structure of the chars produced by the fire-retarded formulations, which hints at their fire-retardancy action - an open-cell charred foam was obtained upon charring at 400 °C or 600 °C. This foaming layer between the degrading melt and the flame would lower the amount of fuel available for combustion, and would also limit the feedback of heat to the condensed phase...|$|R

The second one {{is based on the}} diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and uses the same hardener / accelerator combination. Reactive organophosphorus compounds were incorporated into these resins together with low-priced inorganic substances to give efficient flame-retardant systems.

Combinations of 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -oxa- 10 -phosphaphenanthrene- 10 -oxide (DOPO) and 30 % of crystalline boehmite (Nabaltec (R)) showed outstanding flame retardant efficiencies, so that low phosphorus contents (0. 4 % in DEN 438 (R) / DICY / fenurone, 1. 3 % in DGEBA / DICY / fenurone) were sufficient to reach UL 94 V 0 rating. Melamine polyphosphate (MPP) amplifies the activity of organophosphorus flame retardants, too. Additionally, novel salt-like additives were found to be efficient <b>fire-retardants</b> in the epoxy resins examined. Their flame-retardant efficiencies could be further enhanced by combination with boehmite or MPP. Using these synergistic mixtures allows the maintainence of the glass transition temperature (T-g) of the cured samples and to reduce the loading of phosphorus compounds.

40|$|Abstract Perfluorinated {{alkylated}} substances (PFAS) are persistent compounds {{with many}} uses, for example impregnation of fabrics and leather and as <b>fire-retardants.</b> Recently, it {{has focused on}} these compounds, because of their wide environmental distribution {{and the lack of}} knowledge about their behaviour in the environment. Since they have been detected in the Nordic marine environment, two PFAS were chosen as test compounds. Tributyltin (TBT) has been used in anti-fouling paints since the mid- 1960 s and has proven to have adverse effects on many species. This study aimed at clarifying effects of a 56 day exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and tributyltin (TBT) on the cellular energy allocation (CEA) in the polychaete Hediste diversicolor. Avoidance behaviour, survival and growth were also recorded. The CEA biomarker assay involves using colorimetric biochemical methods to quantify the energy reserves available (Ea) and the energy consumption (Ec). This information can then be integrated into a single value expressing an overall net-energy budget value. The assay was initially developed for use in short-term toxicity assays with Daphnia magna. The compounds spiked in the sediment had not been present in the concentrations intended during the exposure. PFOS was not detected in any of the sediment samples, and was probably washed out of the sediment when it was added to the aquaria. PFNA was detected in sediments not spiked with the compound, probably because it already was present in the sediment to some extent. The compound perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was also found in the sediment samples. There was not observed any significant differences in cellular energy allocation or any other parameters measured between the control group and the treatments. No significant effects were seen with respect to avoidance behaviour, survival or growth, nor did it seem that low actual contaminant concentrations in the sediment significantly affected the cellular energy allocation parameters of the test organisms...|$|R
