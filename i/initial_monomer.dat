50|$|Gelation {{occurs when}} a polymer forms large {{interconnected}} polymer molecules through cross-linking. In other words, polymer chains are cross-linked with other polymer chains to form an infinitely large molecule, interspersed with smaller complex molecules, shifting the polymer from a liquid to a network solid or gel phase. The Carothers equation is an effective method for calculating the degree of polymerization for stoichiometrically balanced reactions. However, the Carothers equation is limited to branched systems, describing the degree of polymerization only {{at the onset of}} cross-linking. The Flory-Stockmayer Theory allows for the prediction of when gelation occurs using percent conversion of <b>initial</b> <b>monomer</b> and is not confined to cases of stoichiometric balance. Additionally, the Flory-Stockmayer Theory can be used to predict whether gelation is possible through analyzing the limiting reagent of the step-growth polymerization.|$|E

It is shown from the experimental data that the polyconjugated system (PCS) formed during thermal oxidation and thermolysis exerts initiating or activating action during the process. The cause of such properties of the PCS is the existence in macromolecules of stable biradicals capable of complex formation with dia-magnetic molecules. in this complex the radical reactivity is enhanced due to an increased probability of ST transfer (effect of local activation).

40|$|The {{structure}} and rheology of randomly branched polyamide melts, {{in particular that}} of branched polyamide 6, are predicted {{on the basis of}} their initial reaction recipe. To this end, a Monte Carlo approach has been developed in order to build different molecular architectures from the <b>initial</b> reactant <b>monomers</b> at the appropriate conversion level. This approach allows us to analyze the composition of these melts in terms of topological architecture and molecular weight of the various polymer species present. Subsequently, the linear rheology of each sample is predicted within the tube model framework [van Ruymbeke et al., Macromol. 2006], based on the position/seniority of the different branches in these polymer species, by averaging over a limited number of representative segments. This approach allows us to discuss the role the different polymer architectures play in the overall viscoelastic response, the importance of the different <b>initial</b> <b>monomers</b> to adequately tune the composition (and thus the rheology) of these branched systems and the necessity of reaching a high conversion level in order to obtain a large zero-shear viscosity. We also extend this approach by applying a bimodal distribution to describe the solid state polycondensation of these products. The predictions are in good agreement with experiments. This method may be applied to any branched polymer product that is synthesized via a melt condensation type reaction and can be used as a tool to test and screen in detail the flow properties of materials without prior synthesis...|$|R

Various types of polymeric nanoparticles were thus synthesized in order to assess the effect of the emulsifier, initiator and comonomer type on the particle morphology, stability and codeposition behavior. The polymerization experiments were carried out in laboratory-scale glass reactors and the most promising recipes were successfully scaled-up in a fully automated pilot-scale reactor. Replicates of some representative experiments, which were run both in lab and pilot-scale reactors, indicated excellent reproducibility of the polymerization process.

Atmospheric pressure (AP) plasma was used to activate the polysulfone substrate surface, and subsequent graft polymerization of hydrophilic monomers was carried out with an aqueous monomer solution. Optimization of generating the surface initiation sites was guided by water contact angle (WCA) measurements of the PSf surface after plasma treatment at different gas compositions, radio frequency (RF) power, and the treatment time. Optimal surface activation of the PSf substrate surface was achieved for AP helium plasma of RF power of 50 W and treatment time of 15 s. Graft polymerization was carried out at <b>initial</b> <b>monomer</b> concentration {{in the range of}} 5 - 20 vol% and reaction time of 0. 5 - 2 h at 60 °C and 70 °C for grafting PMAA and PAA, respectively. Compared to the PSf surrogate surface (WCA: approx. 97 - 100 º), the surface hydrophilicity of the grafted surfaces was improved for all grafting conditions, with the water contact angles of the PMAA- and PAA-grafted polysulfone surfaces decreasing by 28. 8 % and 34. 0 %, respectively, both at the lowest <b>initial</b> <b>monomer</b> concentration of 5 vol% and the longest graft polymerization time of 2 hours. Surface topography of the grafted surfaces was evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Both the surface feature number density and root-mean-square surface roughness (Rrms) increased with <b>initial</b> <b>monomer</b> concentration, from 5 - 20 vol%, suggesting that a higher density of surface grafted chains with a wider chain size distribution was achieved with increased <b>initial</b> <b>monomer</b> concentration.

40|$|In modern world, {{plastics}} play {{a significant}} role in our daily life. However Sri Lankans' still have not introduced proper waste management system to daily increasing plastic garbage. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the main plastic used in day today life as packaging material, soft drink and mineral water bottles. Sri Lankan peoples alone consumes 6. 5 million PET bottles per month but only 1. 5 million bottles collected for recycling. This gives clear indication about the role of PET in environmental pollution. This report present development of effective chemical recycling process to depolymerize PET waste into its <b>initial</b> <b>monomers</b> and use of de-polymerized products to synthesized alkyd resin which can be use in coating industry. Depolymerization of PET was done by hydrolysis method to extract terephthalic acid(TPA). Here Na 2 CO 3 was successfully used as hydrolysis agent instead of highly corrosive NaOH. This overcome the common disadvantages of NaOH. At 170 °C, 35 minutes and 1 : 4 PET: EG (ethylene glycol) mole ratio 78. 89 % PET was reacted with Na 2 CO 3 without any catalyst. Recovered terephthalic acid was used to replace Phthalic anhydride in alkyd resin. Due to the inability of conventional alcoholysis method to making alkyd resin from TPA, a new methodology was developed. New Process was successfully incorporated to produce long oil alkyd resin with soya oil, glycerin, maleic anhydride and recovered TPA. Under this new method alkyd processing time was greatly reduced and minimum time achieved was 120 minutes at 280 °C. Practical application of this project to the local PET waste will help to reduce the plastic land fill in Sri Lanka and also provide more beneficial effects to the alkyd paint industry by reducing production time and raw material cost...|$|R

This paper {{presents an}} understanding of how initial molecular weight and <b>initial</b> <b>monomer</b> fraction affect the degradation of bioresorbable polymers in terms of the underlying hydrolysis mechanisms. A mathematical model was used to analyse the effects of initial molecular weight for various hydrolysis mechanisms including noncatalytic random scission, autocatalytic random scission, noncatalytic end scission or autocatalytic end scission. Different behaviours were identified to relate initial molecular weight to the molecular weight half-life and to the time until the onset of mass loss. The behaviours were validated by fitting the model to experimental data for molecular weight reduction and mass loss of samples with different initial molecular weights. Several publications that consider initial molecular weight were reviewed. The effect of residual monomer on degradation was also analysed, and shown to accelerate the reduction of molecular weight and mass loss.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{strongly}} relates to ongoing {{research on the}} development of cationic polymers which are of great interest due to their enormous potential for biomedical applications, especially as non-viral vectors for gene therapy, antimicrobial agents and active components in DNA sensing devices. The current paper demonstrates that a functional group approach can be successfully realized in a free-radical copolymerization process to prepare cationic copolymers with a desired composition of amine groups, which can be protonated in water thus, providing electrostatic interactions between a polycation and DNA. Three replicas of the cationic copolymer, acrylamide/ 3 -(N,N-dimethylaminopropyl) -acrylamide (AADMAPA), were synthesized using this strategy. The values of average molecular mass and polydispersity index, are similar for the replicas, averaged to 24 000 2000 g mol 1 and 1. 5 0. 1, respectively. The copolymer composition according to 1 H-NMR (D 2 O), was corresponded to the molar ratio of <b>initial</b> <b>monomers.</b> The dynamic light scattering studies and zeta potential measurements confirmed that in water positively charged AADMAPA/DNA polyplexes are formed at N/P > 2. 2 : the formed particles have bimodal distributions with the average diameters of 70 and 700 nm. Zeta potential measurements indicated that the point of zero charge (isoelectric point) is close to N/P y 2. 2. According to the atomic force microscopy positively charged AADMAPA/DNA polyplexes have axially symmetric shapes. The authors are grateful to Prof. Babushkina T. A., Mrs Klimova T.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{replicate}} within their cellular host, many viruses have developed self-assembly strategies for their capsids which are sufficiently robust {{as to be}} reconstituted in vitro. Mathematical models for virus self-assembly usually assume that the bonds leading to cluster formation have constant reactivity over {{the time course of}} assembly (direct assembly). In some cases, however, binding sites between the capsomers have been reported to be activated during the self-assembly process (hierarchical assembly). Results In order to study possible advantages of such hierarchical schemes for icosahedral virus capsid assembly, we use Brownian dynamics simulations of a patchy particle model that allows us to switch binding sites on and off during assembly. For T 1 viruses, we implement a hierarchical assembly scheme where inter-capsomer bonds become active only if a complete pentamer has been assembled. We find direct assembly to be favorable for reversible bonds allowing for repeated structural reorganizations, while hierarchical assembly is favorable for strong bonds with small dissociation rate, as this situation is less prone to kinetic trapping. However, {{at the same time it}} is more vulnerable to monomer starvation during the final phase. Increasing the number of <b>initial</b> <b>monomers</b> does have only a weak effect on these general features. The differences between the two assembly schemes become more pronounced for more complex virus geometries, as shown here for T 3 viruses, which assemble through homogeneous pentamers and heterogeneous hexamers in the hierarchical scheme. In order to complement the simulations for this more complicated case, we introduce a master equation approach that agrees well with the simulation results. Conclusions Our analysis shows for which molecular parameters hierarchical assembly schemes can outperform direct ones and suggests that viruses with high bond stability might prefer hierarchical assembly schemes. These insights increase our physical understanding of an essential biological process, with many interesting potential applications in medicine and materials science. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{problem of}} {{branching}} occurs during propagation, when a chain curls back on itself and breaks - leaving irregular chains sprouting {{from the main}} carbon backbone. Branching makes the polymers less dense and results in low tensile strength and melting points. Developed by Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta in the 1950s, Ziegler-Natta catalysts (triethylaluminium {{in the presence of}} a metal(IV) chloride) largely solved this problem. Instead of a free radical reaction, the <b>initial</b> ethene <b>monomer</b> inserts between the aluminium atom and one of the ethyl groups in the catalyst. The polymer is then able to grow out from the aluminium atom and results in almost totally unbranched chains. With the new catalysts, the tacticity of the polypropene chain, the alignment of alkyl groups, was also able to be controlled. Different metal chlorides allowed the selective production of each form i.e., syndiotactic, isotactic and atactic polymer chains could be selectively created.|$|R
