The first was that “the bomber will always get through.” The speed advantage of biplane fighters over bombers was insignificant, {{and it was}} believed that they would never catch them. Furthermore, there was no effective method of detecting incoming bombers at sufficiently long range to scramble fighters on an interception course. In practice, a combination of new radar technology and advances in monoplane fighter design eroded this disadvantage. Throughout the war, bombers continually managed to strike their targets, but suffered unacceptable losses in the absence of careful planning and escort fighters.

Shi et al. have tried to integrate the properties of CNT with that of dendrimers. MWCNTs were functionalized with generation 5 (G 5) amine-terminated polyamidoamine dendrimers, on which FITC and folic acids were covalently linked. It was found that the nanocomposites are stable and biocompatible. Through amide linkage using 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) chemistry, the dendrimers were attached to the COOH groups present on oxidized CNTs. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the MWCNTs functionalized with folate have selectively target effects of the cancer cells that overexpress folate receptors.

40|$|To {{achieve a}} good control {{performance}} of automatic gantry crane system, sensors are indispensable instrument for feedback signals. However, sensing the payload motion {{of a real}} gantry crane, particularly swing motion, is troublesome and often costly. Therefore, sensorless anti-swing controls for automatic gantry crane system are proposed in this paper. The proposed sensorless anti-swing controls are based on mathematical model of the crane based on two approaches. First, a soft sensor based on mathematical model of the crane is introduced to substitute the real swing sensor. In this method, the swing motion of the payload is estimated based on the mathematical model from the measured trolley position. Second, a reference modifier is introduced to produce anti-swing trajectory while performing trolley positioning. An experimental study using lab-scale automatic gantry crane is carried out {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the proposed sensorless anti-swing controls. The results show that both proposed sensorless anti-swing controls are <b>effective</b> for <b>payload</b> swing suppression since it gives similar performance to the sensorbased anti-swing control.

Polynomial functions are adopted in order to guarantee that the input function has a continuous derivative of an arbitrary order. Moreover, the motion time can be minimised, taking into account constraints on the actuators, by means of a simple bisection algorithm.

40|$|Black-box {{security}} {{testing of}} web applications {{is a hard}} problem. The main complication lies in the black-box assumption: The testing tool has limited insight into the workings of server-side defenses. This has traditionally led commercial as well as research vulnerability scanners toward heuristic approaches, such as testing each input point (e. g. HTTP parameter) with a short, predefined list of <b>effective</b> test <b>payloads</b> to balance between coverage and performance. We take a fresh approach {{to the problem of}} security testing, casting it into a learning setting. In our approach, the testing algorithm has available a comprehensive database of test payloads, such that if the web application’s defenses are broken, then with near certainty one of the candidate payloads is able to demonstrate the vulnerability. The question then becomes how to efficiently search through the payload space to find a good candidate. In our solution, the learning algorithm infers from a failed test—by analyzing the website’s response—which other payloads are also likely to fail, thereby pruning substantial portions of the search space. We have realized our approach in XSS Analyzer, an industry-level cross-site scripting (XSS) scanner featuring 500, 000, 000 test payloads. Our evaluation on 15, 552 benchmarks shows solid results: XSS Analyzer achieves> 99 % coverage relative to brute-force traversal over all payloads, while trying only 10 payloads on average per input point.

We also show that the capsules can be readily detected via rapid X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), vital for progressing such a system towards clinical applications. This also offers the opportunity to image the dispersion of the drug payload post release. These imaging techniques also influenced capsule content and design and the delivered dosage form.

The “pilot missions” include: an extensive provision of specialised services in the 11 / 14 GHz frequency range, a very high capacity service at 20 / 30 GHz for a videocommunication application and a global service at L-Band for aeronautical, land and maritime mobiles. The associated technologies focus essentially on antennas and signal processors. The antenna sub-system must generate high gain spot beams. Low sidelobes requirements are also an essential characteristic in view of an efficient frequency re-use. Large reflectors will be necessary, with possibly a deployment in orbit. Complex and active feed networks will be implemented. On board signal processing represents another major break-through in payload technologies.

The advanced scientific instrumentation on Ulysses continually measures the properties of the heliospheric magnetic field, the solar wind, solar radio bursts and plasma waves, galactic cosmic rays, energetic particles, solar X-rays, and interstellar neutral gas. By the end of 1995, the spacecraft will have completed measurements at heliographic latitudes up to 80 degrees over a single orbit of the Sun. The properties of the heliosphere are solar cycle dependent, and Ulysses' first orbit of the Sun will have taken place around a solar minimum. In order to characterize the heliosphere over a full (11 year) solar cycle, it is desirable to continue measurements over a second orbit of the Sun, a new Odyssey that will extend through 2001.

Due {{to the absence}} of reaction mass, solar sailing can deliver significant effective delta-v to reach high eccentricity and/or high inclination targets which are either difficult or impossible to reach using chemical or even solar electric propulsion. Typically, such missions can be delivered using a small, low cost launch vehicle due to the modest payload required and the use of a low mass solar sail assembly. A range of mission applications will be discussed in some detail, including a sample return mission from a high inclination target body, near Earth asteroid 2001 QP 153, selected as a representative high-energy target body to demonstrate the enabling capability of solar sailing for such missions. In addition, fast rendezvous missions to high eccentricity short period comets will be discussed such as Wirtanen and Encke. For sample return mission, the sample can in principle be delivered to the ISS in low Earth orbit rather than aerocaptured. This return mode would allow the structure of highly porous samples to be preserved by avoid the extreme mechanical loads experienced during re-entry. In addition to the <b>effective</b> delivery of <b>payloads</b> to small bodies, solar sails can station-keep at artificial equilibria in their vicinity to provide novel vantage points for imaging and on-orbit science. For example, by hovering at a fixed phase angle relative to the target body, mapping can be conducted by allowing the target body to rotate relative to the static solar sail. Other more exotic possibilities include using the solar sail as a reflector to enhance surface illumination and to illuminate the interior of shaded craters. Finally, the use of solar sail propulsion for near-Earth asteroid hazard mitigation will be discussed. A near-term solar sail will be investigated which can deliver an inert projectile onto a retrograde solar orbit, raising impact speeds to at least 60 km/s. Such high-energy orbits increase the energy liberated during impact by a factor of 40 or more, while reducing the required projectile mass by at least 95 % relative to conventional concepts for kinetic energy impact schemes using prograde orbits.
