5|$|After {{finding out}} that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true {{feelings}} about the accident and more is revealed about how they actually have felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she {{shows up at the}} office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie, who is at the fundraiser, tells people that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all they did was dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>goes</b> wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in the waiting room, and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later.|$|E
25|$|Standard cost {{accounting}} can hurt managers, workers, and firms in several ways. For example, a policy decision to increase inventory can harm a manufacturing manager's performance evaluation. Increasing inventory requires increased production, {{which means that}} processes must operate at higher rates. When (not <b>if)</b> <b>something</b> <b>goes</b> wrong, the process takes longer and uses more than the standard labor time. The manager appears responsible for the excess, even though s/he has no control over the production requirement or the problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{recreational}} solo diver uses enhanced procedures, {{skills and}} equipment to mitigate {{the risks associated with}} not having another diver immediately available to assist <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>goes</b> wrong. The skills and procedures may be learned by any effective method which provides the appropriate competence, including formal training programmes with associated assessment and certification. Recreational solo diving, once discouraged by most training agencies, has been accepted since the late 1990s by some training agencies for experienced divers who have skills in self-sufficiency and redundant backup equipment, and by experienced divers as a personal choice and assumption of responsibility for their own safety.|$|E

The actual power source for the camera motor was in the sound booth.|$|R
50|$|Torishima {{described}} the Dr. Slump anime as unsuccessful {{in his opinion}} {{because it did not}} loyally follow the manga. He said this was {{because it was the first}} time the Weekly Shōnen Jump team had to manage an anime based on one of their manga and its creative process, explaining that, <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>went</b> wrong, it was too late to change because it was already animated.|$|R
500|$|Moore {{performed}} {{his first}} solo show {{at a small}} club in Istanbul on March 23, 2007. The hour-long show consisted primarily of material from Graveyard Mountain Home, which was accompanied by projections of the corresponding scenes from Age 13. [...] "I {{thought that it would}} be good for the first show to be sort of small and comfortable... so I thought we [...] just have a hundred people," [...] Moore said. [...] "Everybody can see, everybody can be comfortable and sort of enjoy themselves. And <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>goes</b> horribly wrong, it only happens in front of a hundred people." [...] Moore hoped the show would form the basis of more elaborate, longer shows. He planned on playing more shows in Turkey, before touring Europe and the rest of the world.|$|E
2500|$|In current practice, ed {{is rarely}} used {{interactive}}ly, but does find use in some shell scripts. [...] For interactive use, ed was subsumed by the sam, vi and Emacs editors in the 1980s. ed {{can be found}} on virtually every version of Unix and Linux available, and as such is useful for people who have to work with multiple versions of Unix. On Unix-based operating systems, some utilities like SQL*Plus run ed as the editor if the EDITOR and VISUAL environment variables are not defined. <b>If</b> <b>something</b> <b>goes</b> wrong, ed is sometimes the only editor available. This is often the only time when it is used interactively.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a lengthy}} {{interview}} with Paddick published in The Daily Telegraph on 17 November 2007 detailing his thinking on becoming London Mayor, {{he made a}} revealing comment possibly connected with difficulties that have arisen because of the de Menezes killing: [...] "Policing is a dangerous job, we should trust the professional judgement of officers on the front line. We shouldn't prosecute them or their bosses if they decide to put {{their lives on the}} line for the public." [...] In addition, on 26 November 2007 in The Independent Paddick was asked if Commissioner Ian Blair should have resigned over the de Menezes case. His response was: [...] "Yes. The public allows the police to use force on the understanding that someone will be held to account <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>goes</b> wrong. An innocent man was killed by the police and in the absence of any individual officer being held to account, the person at the top should take responsibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|ABC {{required}} Wallenda to wear {{a safety}} harness for the walk. After {{the decision was made}} in mid-May, a spokesperson for ABC explained: [...] "We had always made clear from the beginning that significant safety precautions would need to be taken. This is the outcome of that." [...] Wallenda was not happy about the decision, stating [...] "It's disheartening—I wanted to do it without anything." [...] The Niagara Parks Commission indicated it was unaware of such a requirement when they were considering approval. [...] During the walk, Wallenda told his dad that he felt [...] "like a jackass" [...] wearing the harness. Many observers predicted he would remove the harness partway through the walk, but ultimately he did not do so. Before the crossing, Wallenda had promised that he only would remove the harness if it became a hazard during the walk. [...] "When I first found out about it, {{there was no doubt in}} my mind I was going to take it off", he later said. [...] "But as [...] got closer and closer, I realized I had to honor my word. I've always said I'm a man of integrity." [...] He also acknowledged that removing the harness would have created contractual problems with ABC. [...] "The way a TV network works, <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>goes</b> wrong, they fire people," [...] he said. [...] "If I would have dropped that tether, four people would have been fired because I'm too selfish to care or because it's all about me." [...] In addition to the harness, Wallenda wore a waterproof track suit and shoes custom made by his mother for the walk. Part moccasin, part ballet shoe, the shoes were designed to get a good grip when wet.|$|E

25|$|Ironically enough, {{there was}} {{universal}} reliance on folk healers – but clients often turned them in <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>went</b> wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft {{as a means}} to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.|$|R

The labeled {{expiration date}} is a manufacturer's promise {{for a time}} until which the drug will have full efficacy and be safe as manufactured.

However, {{it is difficult for}} anyone including researchers and physicians to find information to verify how much any given drug will degrade in efficacy or become unsafe over time. Drug manufacturers never support the use of drugs after the expiration date because that could make them liable <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>went</b> wrong.|$|R
