5|$|Lennie {{started on}} the family's player piano {{at the age of}} two or three.

He was born with weak eyesight, possibly as a consequence of his mother being affected by the 1918–19 flu pandemic during pregnancy. A bout of measles when aged six may have exacerbated his condition, and by the age of nine or ten he was totally blind as a result of glaucoma. He initially went to standard state schools, but attended the Illinois School for the Blind in Jacksonville for a decade from around 1928. During his school days he played several instruments, including saxophones, trumpet, guitar, and drums. At the age of eleven he had his first gigs, playing clarinet in a brothel.|$|E
5|$|Lurie's script {{received}} a rewrite by Pamela Pettler, {{who worked with}} Burton on Corpse Bride, but the director hired Big Fish screenwriter John August in December 2003 to start from scratch. Both August and Burton were fans of the book since their childhoods. August first read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>eight</b> years old, and subsequently sent Dahl a fan letter. He {{did not see the}} 1971 film prior to his hiring, which Burton believed would be fundamental in having August stay closer to the book. The writer updated the Mike Teavee character into an obsessive video game player, as compared to the novel, in which he fantasized about violent crime films. The characters Arthur Slugworth and Prodnose were reduced to brief cameo appearances, while Mr. Beauregarde was entirely omitted.|$|E

5|$|Carey has {{routinely}} written {{throughout his}} career, including developing his stand-up comedy routines {{in his early}} stand-up career, and then moving on to assist in writing sitcoms. In 1997, Carey published his autobiography, , wherein he shared memories of his early childhood and of his father's death when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>eight.</b> He also revealed that he was once molested, had suffered bouts of depression, and had made two suicide attempts by swallowing {{a large amount of}} sleeping pills. The book discusses his college fraternity years while attending Kent State University and his professional career up to that time. The book featured large amounts of profanity and, as the title suggests, includes multiple dirty jokes (there is one at the start of each chapter) and references to beer, which was a departure from his on-screen persona. The book was featured on The New York Times bestseller list for three months.|$|E
