5|$|In {{the weeks}} before his death, Goldstein's {{behavior}} had been erratic {{and he had been}} missing appointments.

He promised to check himself into a rehabilitation center following his scheduled gig at Rain Nightclub in Las Vegas that <b>Friday.</b> <b>When</b> he missed his flight and would not return phone calls, friends brought the police to his apartment.|$|E

Angela (Angela Kinsey) {{complains}} to Toby (Paul Lieberstein) about Oscar (Oscar Nunez) wearing sandals to work and having {{to look at his}} feet. Meredith (Kate Flannery) disgusts the rest of the employees by wearing a very short dress without any panties or a bra, thus exposing herself {{to the rest of the}} office as she tries to adjust it to meet Toby's requests. Toby calls a meeting with everyone regarding Casual <b>Friday.</b> <b>When</b> Dwight tries to take charge of the meeting, Toby is finally stern with him and cancels Casual Friday, much to everyone's disappointment.|$|E

The Soviets refused but prepared large amounts of military equipment at airfields for dispatch to Syria and sent Marshall Pavel Stepanovich Kutakhov to Syria {{to find out what}} happened to the Syrian SAMs, fearing that NATO might do the same in Eastern Europe. On June 9, Assad met with American envoy Habib in Damascus and rejected his terms, demanding that Israel withdraw its forces from Lebanon as a condition for a ceasefire. US President Ronald Reagan called on Begin and Assad to accept a ceasefire effective at 6:00 AM, on June 10. By noon on <b>Friday,</b> <b>when</b> the ceasefire took effect, the IAF had shot down 82 aircraft without losing any in air combat.

25|$|Thursday morning, February 3, Mayor Makowski {{lifted the}} travel ban without {{consulting}} {{state or federal}} officials, and many people drove into Buffalo. They found the parking lots were not cleared, so left their cars in the roads. This turned many four-lane roads into two-lane roads. The NWS had forecast snow for Thursday, and the new snow arrived accompanied by winds, resulting in near-zero visibility and some areas claiming worse conditions than the previous <b>Friday</b> <b>when</b> the blizzard initially struck. A state of emergency continued or was declared in additional areas, including Alden, Brant, Evans, Lancaster, Newstead, North Collins, Wales, and West Seneca.

500|$|White is {{also used}} as the color for anyone commemorated on the {{calendar}} who was not martyred and is the color appointed for funerals regardless of whatever {{the color of the}} day might otherwise be. [...] Purple is commonly used for the season of Lent. [...] It is also optional for use during Advent, though blue is the preferred color for this season because of its hopeful connotations rather than the penitential character implied by purple and its association with Lent. Red is used for the commemorations of martyrs and is used on the Day of Pentecost. [...] Scarlet {{is also used}} for Holy Week, though purple is also allowed. [...] Black (with purple as an alternative) may be used on Ash Wednesday. [...] The only day which does not have a color is Good <b>Friday,</b> <b>when</b> all the paraments are traditionally removed from the church.

2500|$|Yaqui Holy Week is both ritualistic and {{theatrical}} in its celebrations. The {{major event}} of the Yaqui Indians during Holy Week occurs on Wednesday evening in which people arrive at the church on horseback and begin to crawl and dance naked on the floor. Light begins {{to go out and}} people beguin the whipping, screaming and crying to the sound of ceremonial music of sacrifice. Children in white robes with blue painted faces and a dark hooded figure, symbolizing the betrayer of Christ, join the Thursday morning procession to the church. There they promise to serve God for the next three or five years, until their eyes start to bleed just like Christ's would. That night, there is a symbolic search for Jesus when the “Pharisees” visit various crosses in the streets and capture the “old man” (symbolic Jesus). A solemn atmosphere arises on <b>Friday</b> <b>when</b> a member of the church who volunteers to represent Jesus is beaten and buried for two days. On Saturday, an image of Jesus’ betrayer, Judas, is detained, as many people gather to watch the celebration. Sunday is a much-anticipated celebration of Christ’s resurrection filled with beautiful flowers and fireworks, while the volunteer rises from where he was burried. [...] A dance drama is performed enacting evil being defeated by good.|$|E
