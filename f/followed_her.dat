5|$|After several {{diplomatic}} {{failures and}} military defeats in the 1730s, Austria {{seemed to be}} declining, or even {{on the verge of}} collapse. After her forty years reign, Maria Theresa left a revitalised empire that influenced the rest of Europe throughout the 19thcentury. She gave the Habsburg dominions an efficient administrative system that allowed it to remain a great power in its own right, without the support of the Holy Roman Empire. Her descendants <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> example and continued reforming the empire. The acquisition of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria gave the empire an even more multinational character that would ultimately lead to its destruction. Her introduction of compulsory schooling, as a means of Germanisation, eventually triggered the revival of Czech culture.|$|E

5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not want to be like either of her parents: her father had <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is {{frequently}} conflicted trying to balance between the two, and fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E

5|$|During her directorship, Cosima opposed {{theatrical}} innovations and adhered {{closely to}} Wagner's original productions of his works, an approach continued by her successors long after her retirement in 1907.

This was {{a defining feature of}} Bayreuth for decades, into the Nazi era which closely <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> death in 1930. Thus, {{although she is}} widely perceived as the saviour of the festival, her legacy remains controversial.|$|E
