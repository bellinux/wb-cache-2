40|$|Web 2. 0 and {{specifically}} Social Networking Software have become ubiquitous tools for communication {{over the last}} five years. Across many disciplines, practitioners and researchers have been exploring these technologies with the hope of tapping into their perceived potential. Not least in this endeavor is the field of Education. Educators and Researchers have been engaged in active research on the practical and pedagogical benefits and implications of Web 2. 0 and Social Networks. This paper explores the use of <b>Facebook</b> <b>Groups</b> in the Undergraduate Computer Science Program at the University of Guyana. Specifically, Guided Assessment strategies using <b>Facebook</b> <b>Groups</b> are compared with unguided and non-assessed <b>Facebook</b> <b>Groups.</b> Specifically, this study provides a comparative outline of the usage patterns of two (2) Instructor-Guided and Assessed <b>Facebook</b> <b>Groups</b> with three (3) student-led, non-assessed <b>Facebook</b> <b>Groups</b> that supported a form of Open Discourse. Results suggest that planned and guided, instructor-directed activities provide more focused responses from students compared to Open Discourse. However, information sharing and communication is common among both groups and in similar patterns. Particularly, students shared links, videos, and blogs with their colleagues. Planned activities are recommended for specific course objectives, while students should be encouraged to evaluate and share information among their peers...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to answer the {{following}} overarching question: How does a Twitter discussion format compare to a Facebook discussion format in terms of promoting collaborative argumentative discourse? Data analysis focused on the difference in amount of arguments, counter-arguments, reasons, and elaborations generated by participants between the two social media platforms. In addition, the impact of participant use of sentence openers on the amount of argument components was also examined. A Mann-Whitney statistical test was conducted to determine the differences between Twitter and <b>Facebook</b> <b>groups</b> in argument components across three small group discussion questions. The results of the test revealed there was a significant difference in the amount of argument components per discussion between Twitter and <b>Facebook</b> <b>groups,</b> with the <b>Facebook</b> <b>groups</b> including more argument components within their discourse. In addition, 15 participants were provided with a list of sentence openers. A content analysis was conducted on 319 tweets//postings. Although zero participants utilized the list, of the 15 participants provided sentence openers, 7 used variations (47 %), with 5 in <b>Facebook</b> <b>groups.</b> Of the 12 participants not provided sentence openers, 4 used variations (33 %), with 2 in <b>Facebook</b> <b>groups.</b> There was a small qualitative trend for the sentence opener groups to use variations, especially the Facebook participants. Based on these results, Facebook was identified as a viable tool to promote collaborative argumentation within an online discussion. What the results of this study determined is that the use of Facebook could be effectively incorporated into a full-semester online course...|$|R
