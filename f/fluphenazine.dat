500|$|A North American tour, the band's {{first since}} 1977, was {{scheduled}} to commence on 17 October 1980. On 24 September, Bonham {{was picked up by}} Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (between 16 and 24 oz.), with a ham roll. After taking a bite of the ham roll he said to his assistant, [...] "breakfast". He continued to drink heavily after arriving at the studio. The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page's house—the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor. After midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45pm the next day, Benji LeFevre (Led Zeppelin's new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead. The cause of death was asphyxiation from vomit; the finding was accidental death. An autopsy found no other recreational drugs in Bonham's body.

50|$|Extrapyramidal {{symptoms}} are most commonly caused by typical antipsychotic drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors. The most common typical antipsychotics associated with EPS are haloperidol and <b>fluphenazine.</b> Atypical antipsychotics have lower D2 receptor affinity or higher serotonin 5-HT2A receptor affinity {{which lead to}} lower rates of EPS.

50|$|<b>Fluphenazine,</b> {{sold under}} the brand names Prolixin among others, is an {{antipsychotic}} medication. It {{is used in}} the treatment of chronic psychoses such as schizophrenia, and appears to be about equal in effectiveness to low-potency antipsychotics like chlorpromazine. It is given by mouth, injection into a muscle, or just under the skin. There is also a long acting injectable version that may last for up to four weeks.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{medications}} {{specifically designed}} to target tics. Typical neuroleptics, or antipsychotics, are primarily used to treat schizophrenia, but one - pimozide (Orap) - has been FDA-approved for treating Tourette's. Pimozide, along with haloperidol and <b>fluphenazine</b> are the medications with the most proven efficacy in controlling tics. These medications work by blocking dopamine receptors, but {{are associated with a}} large side effect profile, including tardive dyskinesia, parkinsonism, dystonia, dyskinesia, and akathisia when used long-term.|$|E
50|$|Decanoate ester prodrugs {{of various}} {{pharmaceuticals}} are available. Since decanoic acid is a fatty acid, forming a salt or ester {{with a drug}} will increase its lipophilicity and its affinity for fatty tissue. Since distribution of a drug from fatty tissue is usually slow, one may develop a long-acting injectable form of a drug (called a Depot injection) by using its decanoate form. Some examples of drugs available as a decanoate ester include nandrolone, <b>fluphenazine,</b> bromperidol, and haloperidol.|$|E
50|$|The oldest depots {{available}} were haloperidol and <b>fluphenazine,</b> with flupentixol and zuclopenthixol as {{more recent}} additions. All have a similar, predominantly extrapyramidal, side effect profile {{though there are}} some variations between patients. More recently, long acting preparations of the atypical antipsychotic, risperidone, and its metabolite paliperidone, have become available thus offering new choices. However, Risperidone tends {{to have a higher}} incidence of extrapyramidal effects when compared to the tricyclic and tetracyclic atypical antipsychotics, such as quetiapine, clozapine, olanzapine, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Rabbit {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} form of extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotic drugs in which [...] tremors occur {{at a rate of}} 5 Hz. Rabbit {{syndrome is}} characterized by involuntary, fine, rhythmic motions of the mouth along a vertical plane, without involvement of the tongue. It is usually seen after years of pharmacotherapy, and is more prominent with high potency drugs like haloperidol, <b>fluphenazine,</b> and pimozide. There is also a low incidence with thioridazine, clozapine, olanzapine, aripiprazole, and low doses of risperidone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fluphenazine</b> {{came into}} use in 1959. The {{injectable}} form {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. In the United States the tablets costs between 0.22 and 0.42 USD per day for a typical dose. The wholesale cost in the developing world of the long acting form is between 0.20 and 6.20 USD per injection as of 2014. It was discontinued in Australia around mid 2017.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{dystonia}} is {{a sustained}} muscle contraction that sometimes appears soon after administration of antipsychotic medications. Any muscle {{in the body}} may be affected, including the jaw, tongue, throat, arms, or legs. When the throat muscles are involved, this type of dystonia is called an acute laryngospasm and is a medical emergency because it can impair breathing. Older antipsychotics such as Haloperidol or <b>Fluphenazine</b> {{are more likely to}} cause acute dystonia than newer agents. Giving high doses of antipsychotics by injection also increases the risk of developing acute dystonia.|$|E
50|$|Some of the high-potency {{antipsychotics}} {{have been}} formulated as the decanoate ester (e.g. <b>fluphenazine</b> decanoate) {{to allow for}} a slow release of the active drug when given as a deep, intramuscular injection. This has the advantage of providing reliable dosing for a person who doesn't want to take the medication. Depot injections can also be used for involuntary community treatment patients to ensure compliance with a community treatment order when the patient would refuse to take daily oral medication. Depot preparations were limited to high-potency antipsychotics so choice was limited.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{movement}} problems, sleepiness, depression and increased weight. Serious side effects may include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, low {{white blood cell}} levels, and the potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia. In older people with psychosis {{as a result of}} dementia it may increase the risk of dying. It may also increase prolactin levels which may result in milk production, enlarged breasts in males, impotence, and the absence of menstrual periods. It is unclear if it is safe for use in pregnancy. <b>Fluphenazine</b> is a typical antipsychotic of the phenothiazine class. Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear but believed to be related to its ability to block dopamine receptors.|$|E
50|$|As a {{long acting}} injection, {{zuclopenthixol}} decanoate {{comes in a}} 200 mg and 500 mg ampoule. Doses can vary from 50 mg weekly to the maximum licensed dose of 600 mg weekly. In general, the lowest effective dose to prevent relapse is preferred. The interval may be shorter as a patient starts on the medication before extending to 3 weekly intervals subsequently. The dose should be reviewed and reduced if side effects occur, though {{in the short term}} an anticholinergic medication benztropine may be helpful for tremor and stiffness, while diazepam may be helpful for akathisia. 100 mg of zuclopenthixol decanoate is roughly equivalent to 20 mg of flupentixol decanoate or 12.5 mg of <b>fluphenazine</b> decanoate.|$|E

5000|$|For {{a number}} of years, {{scholars}} debated amongst themselves whether or not antipsychotic drugs {{had a tendency to}} increase depression or simply help the patient manage their mental illness.

[...] Along with antipsychotic drugs, post-schizophrenic patients may receive antidepressants to actively treat the depression. Drugs are certainly not the only answer, though. At the base of both depression and schizophrenia, social withdrawal is a shared symptom between the two.

40|$|This review covers {{some recent}} work on: 1. The effects of route of {{administration}} on the pharmacokinetics of <b>fluphenazine</b> {{and some of its}} metabolites; 2. The clinical pharmacokinetics of <b>fluphenazine</b> in acute patients medicated with oral fluphenazine; 3. The clinical pharmacokinetics of haloperidol in acute patients medicated with oral haloperidol; 4. The clinical pharmacokinetics of <b>fluphenazine</b> in the maintenance of individuals with chronic schizophrenia with <b>fluphenazine</b> decanoate; 5. A systematic dose reduction study in maintenance treatment refractory patients with oral haloperidol. A study in which plasma levels of <b>fluphenazine</b> and <b>fluphenazine</b> sulfoxide were measured in a group of DSM-III-R patients with schizophrenia before and after switching from oral <b>fluphenazine</b> to depot <b>fluphenazine,</b> decanoate revealed much higher levels of <b>fluphenazine</b> sulfoxide with oral medication compared with those found with depot <b>fluphenazine.</b> These data illustrate the effect of "first pass" metabolism after oral <b>fluphenazine.</b> Thus in a group of 33 patients randomly assigned to receive 5 mg, 10 mg or 25 mg oral <b>fluphenazine</b> daily, steady state plasma <b>fluphenazine</b> levels at each dose were significantly lower that those of <b>fluphenazine</b> sulfoxide or 7 -hydroxy-fluphenazine, although {{there were no significant differences}} between the levels of <b>fluphenazine</b> and <b>fluphenazine</b> N 4 -oxide. On the other hand, plasma levels of the parent drug were significantly higher than those of any metabolite in a corresponding group of patients at steady state on depot medication. These observations underscore the importance of route dependent differences in the pharmacokinetics of <b>fluphenazine</b> which can lead to problems when switching patients from oral to depot neuroleptics. The concept of "disabling side-effects" is an important development in understanding relationships between plasma levels of neuroleptic drugs and clinical response in patients with schizophrenia. Risk-benefit analysis shows clearly that evaluation of relationships between plasma levels and clinical response must take into account the consequences of side-effects which the patient feels have a negating effect on therapy. Emerging data on putative therapeutic plasma level ranges in maintenance therapy are potentially important and may be particularly useful in the maintenance of patients on low dose therapy. It is noteworthy that in a carefully executed dose reduction study in treatment resistant patients under medication with haloperidol, the mean lowest effective dose (8. 7 ng/mL) lay within the optimal therapeutic range (5 ng/mL to 12 ng/mL) found in acutely psychotic patients. The study showed that gradual dose reduction of neuroleptic was possible in chronic treatment resistant patients with schizophrenia who were originally thought by ward staff to require high doses of neuroleptic.
