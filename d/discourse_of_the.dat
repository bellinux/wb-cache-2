25|$|The {{aftermath}} of the uprising established the leading role of the ANC in the anti-apartheid struggle, {{as it was the}} body best able to channel and organise students seeking the end of apartheid. So, although the BCM's ideas had been important in creating the climate that gave the students the confidence to strike out, it was the ANC's non-racialism which came to dominate the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anti-apartheid movement amongst blacks. The perspectives set out in Joe Slovo's essay No Middle Road – written at just this time and predicting the apartheid government had only the choice between more repression and overthrow by the revolutionaries – were highly influential.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the early}} Buddhist texts, after realizing that meditative dhyana was the right path to , but that extreme asceticism didn't work, Gautama {{discovered}} what Buddhists know as being, the Middle Way—a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification, or the Noble Eightfold Path, {{as described in the}} Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, which is regarded as the first <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buddha. In a famous incident, after becoming starved and weakened, he is said to have accepted milk and rice pudding from a village girl named Sujata. Such was his emaciated appearance that she wrongly believed him to be a spirit that had granted her a wish.|$|E

25|$|Miošić's {{poems about}} Skanderbeg from his most {{important}} work A Pleasant <b>Discourse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Slavic People were also basis for Život i viteška voevanja slavnog kneza epirskog Đorđa Kastriota Skenderbega written by Serbian playwright Jovan Sterija Popović in 1828. Ljudevit Gaj published in 1839 and 1840 in periodical Danica ilirska two texts about Skanderbeg, Juraj Skenderbeg and Muhammad and Juraj Skenderbeg and Amurat. Juraj Matija Šporer wrote a tragedy Kastriota Škenderbeg: tragedija u pet izvedah published in Zagreb in 1849 and depicted Skanderbeg as Slav who gathered around himself all South Slavs from Istria to Krujë. Skanderbeg was a subordinate theme in epic poem written by Serbian 19th century academic Jovan Subotić.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{pamphlet}} {{literature on the}} proposed union was produced in the period May to October 1604. Those advocating in print in favour of the union in 1604 included William Cornwallis (The Miraculous and Happy Union between England and Scotland), and John Gordon in his Enotikon Or a Sermon of the Vnion of Great Brittannie. John Thornborough, bishop of Bristol, published A Discourse plainly proving the evident Utility and urgent Necessity of the desired happy Union of England and Scotland (1604); the House of Commons believed the work reflected badly on their proceedings, and reprimanded him. Thornborough then followed with a longer work, Joiefull and Blessed Reuniting. Edward Forsett's A Comparative <b>Discourse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bodies Natural and Politique (1606), on {{the theory of the}} King's Two Bodies, also advocated for the union.|$|E
25|$|In his {{continued}} pursuit and advocacy of his ideas, he further neglected his personal situation and income, falling further {{in debt and}} being shunned by his acquaintances. Despite being appointed an honorary {{member of the national}} Red Cross societies of Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Prussia and Spain, he was nearly forgotten in the official <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Cross Movement, even as it was rapidly expanding to new countries. He lived in poverty, moving to various places between 1874 and 1886, including Stuttgart, Rome, Corfu, Basel, and Karlsruhe. In Stuttgart he met the Tübingen University student Rudolf Müller with whom he would have a close friendship. In 1881, together with friends from Stuttgart, he went to the small Swiss resort village Heiden for the first time. In 1887 while living in London, he began to receive some monthly financial support from some distant family members. This enabled him to live a somewhat more secure existence, and he moved to Heiden in July. He spent {{the rest of his life}} there, and after 30 April 1892 he lived in a hospital and nursing home led by Dr. Hermann Altherr.|$|E

500|$|Her {{paintings}} of war subjects were just {{one aspect of}} Rix Nicholas's developing commitment to nationalist ideals and the heroic representation of Australia. At {{the time of her}} 1919 exhibition, Rix Nicholas had commented that she wished [...] "to show the people [...] what is possessed in a land of beauty where the colour scheme is so different, and which sent so many gallant men to the struggle for liberty". In this respect she was following {{in the tradition of the}} Heidelberg School and writers such as Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson, who extolled the virtues of the bush and pioneer life. Accompanied by her friend Dorothy Richmond, Rix Nicholas set out to paint in rural New South Wales, beginning in Delegate, a small town on the border of New South Wales and Victoria. Here she created numerous works, including In Australia, His Land, and The Shearers. Other works from this period include The Three Sisters, Blue Mountains (1921–22), which is in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia. While Australian patriotic imagery and <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period was very male-dominated, Rix Nicholas's portraits were frequently of women, such as in The Monaro Pioneer, The Magpie's Song and Motherhood.|$|E
500|$|CJ DeLuzio Chasin {{states in}} Reconsidering Asexuality and Its Radical Potential that {{academic}} research on asexuality [...] "has positioned asexuality {{in line with}} essentialist discourses of sexual orientation" [...] which is troublesome as it creates a binary between asexuals and persons who {{have been subjected to}} psychiatric intervention for disorders such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder. Chasin says that this binary implies that all asexuals experience a lifelong (hence, enduring) lack of sexual attraction, that all non-asexuals who experience a lack of sexual desire experience distress over it, and that it pathologizes asexuals who do experience such distress. As Chasin says such diagnoses as HSDD act to medicalize and govern women's sexuality, the article aims to [...] "unpack" [...] problematic definitions of asexuality that are harmful to both asexuals and women alike. Chasin states that asexuality has the power to challenge commonplace <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> naturalness of sexuality, but that the unquestioned acceptance of its current definition does not allow for this. Chasin also argues there and elsewhere in Making Sense in and of the Asexual Community: Navigating Relationships and Identities in a Context of Resistance that is important to interrogate why someone might be distressed about low sexual desire. Chasin further argues that clinicians have an ethical obligation to avoid treating low sexual desire per se as pathological, and to discuss asexuality as a viable possibility (where relevant) with clients presenting clinically with low sexual desire.|$|E
