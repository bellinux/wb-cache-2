5|$|The {{potential}} for generating solar {{energy from the}} Sahara Desert <b>is</b> <b>huge,</b> the highest found on the globe. Professor David Faiman of Ben-Gurion University has stated that the technology now exists to supply all of the world's electricity needs from 10% of the Sahara Desert. Desertec Industrial Initiative was a consortium seeking $560 billion to invest in North African solar and wind installations over the next forty years to supply electricity to Europe via cable lines running under the Mediterranean Sea. European interest in the Sahara Desert stems from its two aspects: the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land. The Sahara receives more sunshine per acre than any part of Europe. The Sahara Desert also has the empty space totalling hundreds of square miles required to house fields of mirrors for solar plants.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} deal with {{problems}} with thousands of variables, it is necessary to use a different approach. One is to first sample one ordering, and then find the optimal BN structure with respect to that ordering. This implies working on the search space of the possible orderings, which is convenient as it is smaller than the space of network structures. Multiple orderings are then sampled and evaluated. This method has been proven to be the best available in literature when the number of variables <b>is</b> <b>huge.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{joint project}} with Brigham Young University using multi-spectral imaging {{technology}} has been extremely successful in recovering previously illegible writing. With multi-spectral imaging, many pictures of the illegible papyrus are taken using different filters, finely tuned to capture certain wavelengths of light. Thus, researchers can find the optimum spectral portion for distinguishing ink from paper in order to display otherwise completely illegible papyri. The amount of text potentially to be deciphered by this technique <b>is</b> <b>huge.</b> A selection of the images obtained during the project and {{more information on the}} latest discoveries has been provided on the project's website.|$|E

In addition <b>is</b> <b>huge</b> rain-collecting cistern to supply water to both keep and the wider castle {{in the event of}} siege. The rectangular cistern includes a vaulted ceiling supported by ten, stone ribs. Rainwater was collected in a reservoir above the vault and channeled to the interior of the cistern by three openings, today covered. Water also collected through another access in the northwest.|$|E

The Bulgarian Federation for Mixed Martial Arts was elected as the national federation representing the Republic of Bulgaria under the International Mixed Martial Arts Federation in October 2014; and like all IMMAF members, is a non-profit, democratic organization. Established in November 2013 by 10 MMA clubs, the organization is headed by UFC competitor Stanislav Nedkov. The federation's registration to the Ministry of Justice was approved in June 2014 and its application for formal recognition by the Ministry of Sport is in its advanced stages.|$|E

25|$|Clustering {{of genes}} in prokaryotes {{was known for}} a long time. Their genes are grouped in operons, genes within operons share a common {{promoter}} unit. These genes are mostly functionally related. The genome of prokaryotes is relatively very simple and compact. In eukaryotes the genome <b>is</b> <b>huge</b> and only a small amount of it are functionally genes, furthermore the genes are not arranged in operons. Except for nematodes and trypanosomes; although their operons are different from the prokaryotic operons. In eukaryotes each gene has a transcription regulation site of its own. Therefore, genes don’t have to be in close proximity to be co-expressed. Therefore, it was long assumed that eukaryotic genes were randomly distributed across the genome due to the high rate of chromosome rearrangements. But because the complete sequence of genomes became available it became possible to absolutely locate a gene and measure its distance to other genes.|$|E

The phase two completion <b>is</b> <b>huge</b> milestone because this phase included important aspects such as: high-efficiency affordable housing in town-house style and four-story elevator buildings. Part of this project was funded by a HOPE VI grant which ensured $22-million dollars for the project to build these new public houses for the citizens of South Boston 223 original apartments along Old Colony Ave up to Dorchester Street and over to Reverend Burke Street. These affordable housing units are some of the greenest and most environmentally friendly public houses in the entire Commonwealth.
