50|$|The {{reforms are}} {{sometimes}} named after their leaders Stein and Hardenberg, {{but they were}} also the fruit of a collaboration between experts, each with his own speciality. One of these experts was Heinrich Theodor von Schön - born in 1773, he had studied law at Königsberg university to follow a career in political sciences. In 1793 he entered Prussian service. Nine years later, he became financial councillor to the Generaldirektorium. When the Prussian government fled to Königsberg after its defeat at Jena, he followed Stein there. It was there that he brought to bear his expertise on serfdom and it was his treatise that would help Stein write the October edict. Unlike Stein, Schön backed a greater liberalisation of landowning - for him, <b>economic</b> <b>profitability</b> had to take first priority, even if this was to the peasants' disadvantage. From 1816, Schön became Oberpräsident, a post he held for around 40 years, and devoted himself to the economic and social life of the provinces which he governed.|$|E
5000|$|Infections with A. suum, and {{especially}} the larval migration phase, have shown to reduce the <b>economic</b> <b>profitability</b> of a pig farm. The presence of this parasite on a pig farm reduces its productivity {{in a number of}} direct or indirect ways. Perhaps the most obvious of which is the condemnation of the livers that are visibly affected by parasite migration. Whether the liver is trimmed or fully condemned evidently depends on the amount of white spots detected on the liver. At the level of the lung, the passage of ascarid larvae is associated with impaired pulmonary bacterial clearance [...] making it easier for secondary bacterial and viral infections to settle. Increased susceptibility to Pasteurella multicoda, Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. have already been associated with ascariosis. Moreover, a recent study also observed a significant negative effect of A. suum infection on the seroconversion and antibody levels to a Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae vaccine. Not only the negative effects of these diseases on the productivity but also the costs of their treatment indirectly contributes to the effect of ascariosis.|$|E

50|$|At {{the onset}} of Atlantic Slave Trade, black male labor was largely favored to that of black female labor. Eventually, though, the notion of women as indentured {{servants}} was introduced {{as a means to}} maximize <b>economic</b> <b>profitability.</b> This meant that, historically, females were valued largely for their reproductive capabilities which was thought to {{be an integral part of}} plantation sustainability. The slave trade and indentured servitude launched the racial and gendered institutional struggles that women would face for times to come. Following 1838, the post-emancipation period offered a time in which a number of Indian indentured servants were introduced to the Caribbean. The influx inadvertently offset the ratio between indentured women and men, and, as a result, increased the desire for the incorporation of women into the bodies of servitude. These longterm struggles ultimately forged the way for the female revolutions and radical movements to come. The 1970's marked a time in which the feminist movement really gained traction. The following decade included a number of attempts at inter-regionally building transitional feminist networks that spread geographically between Latin America and the Caribbean. This platform was founded and established by young, leftist generations. Immediately following the devastation that resulted from the Cold War, the 1990's marked a period in which the feminist movement shifted focus toward female perspectives on political matters such as globalization, environmental crises and development. In 1995, the Fourth World Conference on Women signaled significant mobilization for the Caribbean feminist movement. This platform functioned as a means to take advantage of national representation and regional collaboration. Since then, the feminist movement has experienced friction in regards to the debate over whether or not feminist organizing should shift toward more professional nongovernment organizations (NGOs). The shift threatens the prevalence of small, identity-based social movement organizations and has thus sparked controversy among feminist players, specifically leftist feminist networks.|$|E
