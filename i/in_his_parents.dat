500|$|Ion Heliade Rădulescu made {{extensive}} use of the Romantic nationalist focus on history, which he initially applied to his poetry. In this instance as well, {{the goal was to}} educate his public; he wrote: [...] "Nothing is worthy of derision as much as someone taking pride <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> and ancestors and nothing more worthy of praise than when the ancestors' great deeds serve as a model and an impulse for competition among descendants". The main historical figure in his poetry is the late 16th century Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave, the first one to rally Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania under a single rule: celebrated in Heliade's poem O noapte pe ruinele Târgoviştii ("A Night on the Ruins of Târgovişte"), he was to be the main character of a lengthy epic poem, Mihaiada, of which only two sections, written in very different styles, were ever completed (in 1845 and 1859 respectively). Other historical poems also expanded on the ideal of a single Romanian state, while presenting the 1848 generation as a model for future Romanian politicians.|$|E
2500|$|Ichiro Yamaguchi {{was born}} in Otaru, Hokkaido in 1980. He grew up {{listening}} {{to a wide variety of}} music, as his father ran a business that acted as a cafe during the daytime and as a bar at night. His father had lived in Europe for many years, so often played music such as the German electronic band Kraftwerk. The business would occasionally hold performances for musicians, such as Japanese folk singer Masato Tomobe. This variety made it feel natural for Yamaguchi to create multi-genre music. Yamaguchi began to play music naturally, learning how to play the guitar after picking up an acoustic guitar that was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> home. The first songs he learnt on the guitar were Kaguya-hime/Iruka's 1970 folk song [...] "Nagoriyuki" [...] and Takuro Yoshida's [...] "Kekkon Shiyō yo" [...] (1972). He was inspired to write lyrics by the large amount of second hand books his father bought, such as those of Kenji Miyazawa, Osamu Dazai, Chūya Nakahara and Yoshiro Ishihara, as well as haiku poets Santōka Taneda and Shūji Terayama.|$|E

60|$|From {{this period}} might be dated an opinion of Francis's, which never {{afterwards}} left him; he fancied {{he was doing}} injustice to another, and that other, a brother whom he ardently loved, by continuing to exist. Had he met with fondness <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents,</b> or sociability in his playfellows, these fancies would have left him as he grew into life. But the affections of his parents were settled on his more promising brother; and his manners daily increasing in their repulsive traits, drove his companions to the society of others, more agreeable to their own buoyancy and joy.|$|E
6000|$|The {{relation}} between {{parent and child}} has cruel moments for the parent even when money is no object, and the material worries are delegated to servants and school teachers. The child and the parent are strangers to one another necessarily, because their ages must differ widely. Read Goethe's autobiography; and note that though he was happy <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> and had exceptional powers of observation, divination, and story-telling, he knew less about {{his father and mother}} than about most of the other people he mentions. I myself was never on bad terms with my mother: we lived together until I was forty-two years old, absolutely without the smallest friction of any kind; yet when her death set me thinking curiously about our relations, I realized that I knew very little about her. Introduce me to a strange woman who was a child when I was a child, a girl when I was a boy, an adolescent when I was an adolescent; and if we take naturally to one another I will know more of her and she of me at the end of forty days (I had almost said of forty minutes) than I knew of my mother at the end of forty years. A contemporary stranger is a novelty and an enigma, also a possibility; but a mother is like a broomstick or like the sun in the heavens, it does not matter which as far as one's knowledge of her is concerned: the broomstick is there and the sun is there; and whether the child is beaten by it or warmed and enlightened by it, it accepts it as a fact in nature, and does not conceive it as having had youth, passions, and weaknesses, or as still growing, yearning, suffering, and learning. If I meet a widow I may ask her all about her marriage; but what son ever dreams of asking his mother about her marriage, or could endure to hear of it without violently breaking off the old sacred relationship between them, and ceasing to be her child or anything more to her than the first man in the street might be? ...|$|E
