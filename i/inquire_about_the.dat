NYET {{indicates that a}} split transaction is not yet complete, while ERR handshake indicates that a split transaction failed. A second use for a NYET packet is to tell the host that the device has accepted a data packet, but cannot accept any more due to full buffers. This allows a host to switch to sending small PING tokens to <b>inquire</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> device's readiness, rather than sending an entire unwanted DATA packet just to elicit a NAK.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, few {{professional}} football games took longer than {{two and a}} half hours to play, and the Jets–Raiders' three-hour time slot was thought to be adequate. A high-scoring contest, together with a number of injuries and penalties for the two bitter AFL rivals, caused the game to run long. NBC executives had originally ordered that Heidi begin at 7:00p.m. ET, but decided to allow the game to air to its conclusion. However, as 7p.m. approached, NBC's switchboards were jammed by viewers phoning to <b>inquire</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> night's schedule, preventing the planned change from being communicated. Heidi began as scheduled, preempting the final moments of the game and the two Oakland touchdowns in the eastern half of the country, to the outrage of viewers.|$|E
5|$|The remastered {{version was}} {{predicated}} on the transition of LucasArts from a developer and publisher into a licensor and publisher in 2013 shortly after its acquisition by Disney. Under new management, LucasArts licensed several of its intellectual properties (IP), including Grim Fandango, to outside developers. Schafer was able to acquire {{the rights to the}} game with financial assistance from Sony, and started the process of building out the remaster within Double Fine Productions. Schafer said that the sale of LucasArts to Disney had reminded them of the past efforts of former LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez to release the older LucasArts titles as Legacy Properties, such as the 2009 rerelease of The Secret of Monkey Island. Schafer also noted that they had tried to acquire the property from Lucasarts in the years prior, but the frequent change in management stalled progress. When they began to <b>inquire</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rights with Disney and LucasArts following its acquisition, they found that Sony, through their vice president of publisher and developer relations Adam Boyes, was also looking to acquire the rights. Boyes stated that Sony had been interested in working with a wide array of developers for the PlayStation 4, and was also inspired to seek Grim Fandango after seeing developers like Capcom and Midway Games revive older properties. Boyes' determination was supported by John Vignocchi, VP of Production for Disney Interactive, who also shared memories of the game, and was able to bring in contacts to track down the game's assets. After discovering they were vying for the same property, Schafer and Boyes agreed to work together to acquire the IP and subsequent funding, planning to make the re-release a remastered version. Sony did not ask for any of IP rights for the game, instead only asking Double Fine to give the PlayStation platforms console exclusivity in exchange for funding support, similar to their Pub Fund scheme they use to support independent developers.|$|E

Sir Frank Noyce also joined the team. Lord Halifax, then President of the British Board of Education, led a selection committee that nominated Arthur E.

25|$|The {{liability}} {{limit of}} the owner's policy is typically the purchase price paid for the property. As {{with other types of}} insurance, coverages can also be added or deleted with an endorsement. There are many forms of standard endorsements to cover a variety of common issues. The premium for the policy may be paid by the seller or buyer as the parties agree. Usually a custom in a particular state or county on this matter reflects in most local real estate contracts. One should <b>inquire</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cost of title insurance before signing a real estate contract that provides that he pay for title charges. A real estate attorney, broker, escrow officer (in the western states), or loan officer can provide detailed information as to the price of title search and insurance before the real estate contract is signed. Title insurance coverage lasts as long as the insured retains an interest in the land insured and typically no additional premium is paid after the policy is issued.|$|E

Reports from the Colombian Minister of Mines, Minister of Defence, and Minister of Public Works [...] "all {{asserted}} {{that the government was}} aware of the risk from the volcano and was acting to protect the population". The lack of responsibility for the disaster prompted lawmakers to campaign for Tolima's governor (Eduardo Alzate Garcia) to resign. In the media, similar thoughts and questions were hotly debated. One of the most aggressive campaigns came from a mass funeral in Ibagué for the victims, claiming that [...] "The volcano didn't kill 22,000people. The government killed them." ...|$|E

As his workforce expands, Butters starts offering health care and other benefits to his employees, attracting more and more adults. To this end, he visits the local ACORN office to apply for low-income housing benefits, seek mortgage loans, and <b>inquire</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> tax-status of his business.

500|$|The {{combination}} of these issues later resulted in the bankruptcy of the company, {{and the majority of}} them were perpetuated by the indirect knowledge or direct actions of Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, Andrew Fastow, and other executives such as Rebecca Mark. Lay served as the chairman of the company in its last few years, and approved of the actions of Skilling and Fastow although he did not always <b>inquire</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> details. Skilling constantly focused on meeting Wall Street expectations, advocated the use of mark-to-market accounting (accounting based on market value, which was then inflated) and pressured Enron executives {{to find new ways to}} hide its debt. Fastow and other executives [...] "created off-balance-sheet vehicles, complex financing structures, and deals so bewildering that few people could understand them." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Sadat, it {{was only}} when the Israelis cut off the Egyptian {{garrison}} at Sharm el-Sheikh that Nasser became aware of the situation's gravity.

The simmering conflict between Nasser and Amer subsequently came to the fore, and officers present reported the pair burst into [...] "a nonstop shouting match". The Supreme Executive Committee, set up by Nasser to oversee the conduct of the war, attributed the repeated Egyptian defeats to the Nasser–Amer rivalry and Amer's overall incompetence. According to Egyptian diplomat Ismail Fahmi, who became foreign minister during Sadat's presidency, the Israeli invasion and Egypt's consequent defeat was a result of Nasser's dismissal of all rational analysis of the situation and his undertaking of a series of irrational decisions.|$|E
