During malting, the high energy cost is mainly {{due to the}} kilning stage. In order to reduce this consumption, the possibility of reducing the duration of kilning was studied. This reduction involves obtaining malt with an higher moisture content than what is actually produced. For this purpose, it was analyzed the influence of drying program in moisture content and in other characteristics of malt. Drying assays was performed, wherein the malt was subjected to different temperature programs, which allowed obtaining malt with different moisture contents. Physical and chemical malt characteristics were analyzed and related to the moisture content and temperature program. Kilning profiles of the drying chambers were established in order to acess the possibility of reduce drying time. The results suggest the possibility to increase the moisture content of malt up to 8 % because up to this value, every characteristics analyzed are within the limits established. It isn´t possible to reduce the <b>kilning</b> <b>time</b> since the moisture loss from malt sublayers are very heterogeneous and this moisture difference remains {{until the end of}} the process...|$|E

40|$|Wood drying is {{essential}} for preparation of this natural resource for practical applications. Solar drying can reduce drying costs and energy consumption. There are many potential models to describe the drying process. However, most models confirm that the tortuosity of the moisture transport path is an important control parameter during the diffusion-controlled drying process. Microwave heating equations, which have been presented elsewhere (Brodie, 2003; 2004), suggested that microwave induced thermal runaway rapidly generates steam in moist wood. The resulting internal pressure selectively ruptures the wood structure creating radial pathways through which moisture may readily move, as described by Torgovnikov and Vinden (2003). Subsequent experimentation in a solar kiln, specifically designed and evaluated for this project, resulted in a 17 % reduction in drying time for microwave treated Populus alba samples, compared with untreated samples dried in the solar kiln at the same time.

Few studies have attempted to model the moisture content of wood during drying process. Wu and Avramidis (2006) [12] applied ANN modeling to the prediction of timber kiln drying rates based on species, basic density and drying time. Accurate prediction of the experimental drying rate data was achieved with the developed ANN model, supporting the powerful predictive capacity of ANN modeling method.

In the above studies, however, the inherent variation in the drying characteristics between individual timbers was not taken into consideration, and it is unclear that ANNs would be applicable for predicting the moisture contents of each timber in the stack. If the MCf of individual timbers can be predicted by ANNs prior to drying, it will be beneficial for sawmills to improve pre-sorting strategies and drying schedules.|$|R

Sites where lime had been produced for centuries were converted to the production of the new binder or completely abandoned. Consequently, in about one century, lime became a not well known, “old” material ties to the old generations: the only one who knew the “secrets of art” of making a good lime. As the last masters worked until about 1950 in few decades the knowledge of this generation is going to disappear. But this disappearance is also due the transformations in the methods of knowledge transmission. In fact, when the oral, visual and manual transmission of knowledge, used for many generations, was stopped because the diffusion of compulsory education, it was lost also the “material culture” of many materials (lime, but also wood, stones, etc.). Nowadays, without the help of those old masters it is almost impossible to reconstruct that knowledge and, consequently, it is impossible to reproduce those materials (sometimes better then the new ones) even if the most modern analytical techniques are applied. In fact, as the time goes on, lime attracts more and more interests: restorer, architects and producers mainly attracted by its compatibility with old constructions and environmental friendliness. Consequently, the interest that at the begin of last century, was only of few historians, became a common interest during the time so that currently involve discipline like archaeology, geology, restoration and materials engineering, interested in the recovery of old “secrets of arts”. Today, reconstruct the old productive technology means to use all sources of information currently available and to	 try to take out the highest number of useful information for crossings, compare and, in a second time, verify the results of researches with production tests.

5000|$|Production of Benjarong is {{a process}} known to only small {{communities}} of Thai artists which have passed down the knowledge from generation to generation. The artisan who makes Benjarong {{has to be very}} skillful and careful. The production process is needs a skilled labor. How the Benjarong is made and how the patterns are painted, are glamorous and all considered as the masterpieces. In the porcelain selection, only white porcelain (Bone China and Royal Porcelain) which had been fired at the proper temperature (1150-1280 degree Celsius) for many hours, are selected. White ware must not have any flaw. After we get all required white wares, cleaning is the next process. During this process, it is necessary to avoid oily surface from sweaty and dirty hand. In drawing process, we use hypodermic syringe or paint brush to draw line. The process begins with drawing the circular guide lines on the Thai porcelain on a turning wheel, which is manually controlled. While drawing on the design, the artist will keep the sample pattern in front of him so he can draw the pattern correctly. The initial pattern drawing is very crucial to how the design will turn out, so it will be done by the well-experienced artist (usually drawn by a master craftsman). This is the reason why the pattern is drawn in very fine lines on each Benjarong. In painting process, there are various colors of paint but basically we use five main colors (black, green, yellow, red and white). The specialized paint for Benjarong needs a skillful painter. The paint is made from mineral colors and must be well crushed and mixed with water in proper ratio. The crushing equipment is ceramic or equivalent material mortar. The paint should not be too thick or thin. If the paint is too thick, it will not be completely fired and the color will not be shown as expected. If the paint is too thin, the color will fade. Also, the paint must not overlap with any line of the other color. At the final stage of painting, the 18 karat gold might be added to the rims {{in order to make it}} look glamorous. The next step after painting is firing. Painted wares will be put in the kiln. The spaces between them are 0.5 - 1 cm unless you want the painted wares to touch each other and might get damaged to pattern that painted after firing. The temperature in the kiln is controlled between 800 to 1000◦C and takes about 10 hours firing time. The Benjarong must be put in the <b>kiln</b> five <b>times.</b> After finished firing, the Benjarong will be cooled down; then take it off from the kiln. Once the Benjarong has been fired, it can be seen as three dimensional bubble of paint on the surface, which is the reason why Benjarong is unique. At the end of production, there will a quality control. The slightest mistake in any process would ruin the design and fame of Benjarong. Any mistake is unacceptable. Benjarong supposed to be perfect in every respect. If the mistake is found, it will be sent back to the studio or might throw it away. In fact, this is very rare to happen because during each stage the artists take good care of each individual piece. (Blobiztar Company Limited) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} dried {{softwood}} timber depends of {{course on the}} drying process performance and in batch kilns especially on the drying schedule. In the Nordic countries the drying schedule is almost always a time based schedule, i. e. the target climate {{is defined as a}} function of drying time. The basic idea is that the average properties of each batch (same wood species and board dimension) are almost constant and when a suitable drying schedule has been found, then it can be used repeatedly without changes. In continental Europe the target climate is very often defined {{as a function of the}} actual average MC of the batch. The basic idea here is to adapt the schedule according to the real properties of each batch. This is a correct approach, but the problem is to measure the average MC accurately during the process. This is normally done by pairs of electrodes driven into a limited number of boards for electric resistance measurements. Each board has however individual properties and the measured MC differs normally from the average MC of the batch. In addition the MC value based on the electric resistance is not fully reliable. This introduces a stochastic element in the performance of the kiln control system. The aim of this paper is to analyse the accuracy of the MC based schedule control and compare it to the time based schedule approach. The analysis is performed using a simulation program for the drying process. Virtual boards with different properties (initial MC, heartwood content, density and ‘dryability’) are generated using a random number generator. It has been taken into account that the properties mentioned are not statistically independent. In this way a batch of timber is generated and the drying of each board is simulated in order to get the individual final MC and further the MC standard deviation for the whole batch. The MC based drying schedule is applied according to the calculated MC of a few randomly selected boards. The influence on the final MC variation, by the number of boards selected for MC estimation, can thus be determined, as well as the influence of some other features. The results are then compared to the corresponding results for a similar <b>kiln</b> using a <b>time</b> based drying schedule...|$|R

The length and width of the brick stack is taken as 920 mm × 440 mm. With a gap of 400 mm and 100 mm between two brick stacks longitudinally and laterally respectively, a total of 450 (6 × 75) stacks can be accommodated inside the <b>kiln</b> at a <b>time.</b> Brick stack height including the kiln car height is taken as 1. 38 m. There is a clearance of 100 mm between the stack and the kiln roof. To produce certain quality bricks/ceramics, a particular temperature distribution throughout the kiln needs to be maintained. This temperature distribution with respect to the kiln length is known as Tunnel kiln curve. To achieve the Tunnel kiln curve obtained from industry for ordinary brick type, some design parameters need to be optimized for a given geometry.  Selection of these optimized design parameters are obtained through a series of trial and error runs of the CFD model. The total length of the tunnel can be divided into pre-heating, firing and cooling zones. Green bricks pass through the pre-heating, then firing and finally the cooling zones, while fresh air flows in opposite direction of the brick stack move. It is to be noted that brick industries are very reluctant to disclose any of those technical secrets related to their brick kiln design. In this regard, this design is based on initial guesses of those parameters and slowly come up with best performing scenario with respect to considered Tunnel kiln curve. To achieve the Tunnel kiln curve, the design parameters that need to be played around are gas and air flow rates, flow directions, their inlet-outlet number, spacing and placements at different locations of the kiln are considered very crucial. Other important parameters that are varied include brick stack placement with respect to air and gas inlet-outlets, gaps between iv kiln roof and stacks and gaps between two consecutive stacks. To supply adequate air, a large rectangular air inlet with an area of 0. 8 m 2 is placed at the roof of the exit end of the kiln. To maintain the air temperature distribution as given in Tunnel kiln curve, one intermediate size air outlet with an area of 0. 4 m 2 and a series of 13 rows × 12 columns small air inlet-outlets (openings) are also placed at the roof of the kiln in the cooling zone. All these heated air has been transferred to dryer to dry the green bricks. A series of 12 rows × 12 columns of gas inlets are placed in the roof of the firing zone. At the entry end of the tunnel, a flue gas outlet with an area of 0. 8 m 2 is placed in the roof.  Due to three dimensional nature of the kiln geometry, the CFD simulation of the whole system would be very time consuming. A close look of the geometry dictates that, a one-sixth slit of the total geometry (100 m × 3. 24   61 × m) containing 1 row × 75 stacks of bricks is enough to simulate the whole geometry of the kiln. This modelled geometry is meshed and mesh independency is checked using ANSYS Mesh. Turbulence, combustion and radiation models are adopted to simulate a realistic Tunnel kiln environment using ANSYS CFX Pre.  Several model runs are performed until the simulated temperature distributions obtained closely replicate the Tunnel kiln curve of the industry. From these simulations, the optimum Tunnel kiln design is suggested. The resulting CO 2 and NO emissions are also obtained from these simulations. Gas inlet velocity is proposed to be 6 m/s with an inlet diameter of 25 mm.  Gas velocity direction is suggested to be normal to the kiln roof. Air flow direction should be at 14 o with kiln roof towards firing zone. Gaps between brick stacks and the kiln roof should be about 200 mm. To get a uniform distribution of heated gases, positions of the brick stacks are such that on each occasion of its changed position it would be just directly below the inlet jets. Gaps between two consecutive brick stacks should also be reduced to 200 mm instead of the initially assumed 400 mm spacing. Hence additional number of bricks could be accommodated inside the <b>kiln</b> at a <b>time</b> which will result higher production of bricks with the same amount of fuel...|$|R
40|$|Measuring the {{temperature}} distribution inside the rotary kilns, using thermocouples for instance {{has proven to}} be difficult due to the harsh operating conditions of the kiln. Numerical modelling of turbulent combustion and the associated physical phenomenon thus proves to be an indispensable tool towards predicting the kiln operating conditions. The purpose of the present work was to make a step towards modelling the cement rotary kiln used by Almatis B. V. in Rotterdam for the production of calcium-aluminate cement. The detailed mathematical model of the rotary kiln would be developed using the open source CFD toolbox OpenFOAM. The main advantage of OpenFOAM is that, contrary to most of the commercial CFD software, it is license fee free and allows access to the source code, which was also the motivation behind this work. To accurately model the Almatis kiln the following important phenomenon have to be taken into account: turbulent non-premixed combustion of hydrocarbon gases in the burner, radiative heat transfer distribution in the kiln and, the conjugate heat transfer through the furnace walls. In the present work the new solver implemented in OpenFOAM for turbulent combustion and radiation modelling was validated using the benchmark Sandia Flame D test case. There was good agreement seen between the results from simulations and experimental data for the Sandia Flame D test case indicating the adequacy and accuracy of the implemented transient solver and its readiness for further combustion application development. Due to the very complex geometry of the Almatis Kiln the relatively simple geometry of the Burner Flow Reactor (BFR) was considered for further simulations. The simulation results obtained for the Burner Flow Reactor (BFR) were compared with the commercial package ANSYS Fluent for consistency. The OpenFOAM toolbox was evaluated in two stages of increasing complexity: isothermal(cold) flow simulation and non-premixed gas combustion simulation using a turbulent incompressible flow solver. The cold flow comparison gave almost identical results for both OpenFOAM and ANSYS Fluent. However the reacting flow results showed varying agreement with ANSYS Fluent. The mass fraction of species showed good agreement but {{the temperature}} profile showed some deviations. With more stringent global NOx emission standards, predicting NOx formation in industrial furnaces is now a priority. The CFD modelling of pollutant NOx formation was considered in the present work. A new solver in OpenFOAM was developed for thermal NO prediction. The solver was validated with the ANSYS Fluent NOx post-processing utility using the Burner Flow Reactor geometry. The effectiveness of NOx reduction mechanisms including the variation of air to fuel equivalence ratio and flue gas re-circulation (FGR) was demonstrated using the Burner Flow Reactor test case. From this study it was concluded that OpenFOAM is a promising toolbox for modelling turbulent combustion and can be used for predicting the operating conditions of complex industrial furnaces. The current bottleneck identified with OpenFOAM is the very high computational cost of the implemented transient solver for turbulent combustion and radiation modelling. The computational cost of the transient solver far exceeds that of the steady state solvers available in commercial packages for example ANSYS Fluent. Therefore, to simulate very large scale industrial furnaces such as the Almatis <b>Kiln</b> in realizable <b>time</b> the implementation of a steady state solver for turbulent combustion applications in OpenFOAM is indispensable. It would also be essential to include the accompanying phenomenon of conjugate heat transfer into the solver. These can be accomplished {{as a part of the}} future work.
