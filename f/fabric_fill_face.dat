The goal of the work was to verify functionality of this bag in one of the hydraulic troughs in the Laboratory of Water Management Research of Department of Water Structures of the Faculty of Civil Engineering, Brno University of Technology. To assess the functionality, the bag stability was tested with various water levels, and discharge coefficient and specific leakage per one standard meter of the bag was determined. The resulting discharge coefficient was compared with discharge coefficients of similarly shaped constructions. The work includes comparison of the flood bags with commonly used bags. Furthermore, the data obtained by measuring and processed in the tabular and graphical form are presented in the work...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. On {{the basis}} of the field measurement, the {{characteristics}} of advance strata behavior are analyzed in the past <b>filling</b> working <b>face</b> and the advance support method is optimized in the roadway. The practical measure researches show that, because the paste filling supports the overlying strata of the goaf availably, the strata behaviors of 2351 paste <b>filling</b> working <b>face</b> in Daizhuang coalmine are not obvious; And the protective pillar bears a little load, The strata behaviors in non-production side are smaller than that in production side. The overlying strata gravity mainly acts on the coal wall in front of the face and the paste filling in the goaf. The value and main influence range of advance stress in front of the face is quite small and the main influence range is less than 15 m. According to the advance strata behavior characteristics of the paste <b>filling</b> working <b>face,</b> the advance support of the track roadway is changed from 3 rows to 2 rows. And the support length of each row reduces from 20 m to 15 m. The advance support after optimizing can reduce the labor intensity greatly and improve the working efficiency of backfill mining...|$|R

The lack of a reliable water outlet for this new lake forced one of the largest mobilizations of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ever commenced in the western U.S. Before the new landslide was breached by the quickly rising waters, a spillway was constructed to ensure erosion and potential failure of the natural dam would be minimized.|$|R
