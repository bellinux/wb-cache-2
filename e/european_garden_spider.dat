40|$|In nature, animals {{must contend}} with the {{presence}} of noise, which may limit their ability to detect prey, attract mates and escape predators. Sources of noise vary and may originate from natural (e. g. animal sounds, water) or anthropogenic (e. g. traffic, construction) sources. The vibratory sensory modality has long been overlooked in the study of anthropogenic effects on wildlife. Human-induced environmental changes may introduce noise sources as well as artificial substrates that alter vibratory noise profiles, leading to maladaptive behavioural responses. We conducted field measurements of vibratory noise on various substrate types (natural and artificial) used by animals in human-developed habitats. Next, we conducted laboratory experiments on how vibratory noise affects the prey detection ability of the <b>European</b> <b>garden</b> <b>spider,</b> Araneus diadematus. We tested whether changes in vibratory noise profiles consistent with anthropogenic alterations of vibratory habitats are sufficient to alter the spider's sensitivity to prey cues. We found that overall noise amplitude on artificial substrates was lower and less variable across contexts compared with natural substrates. In experiments with different noise levels, we observed that garden spiders showed noise-dependent changes in sensitivity to prey-mimicking cues, with response thresholds lowest at intermediate noise levels. Experimental levels of intermediate noise consistent with field measurements on natural substrates suggest that spiders' predatory performance is higher when webs are constructed on natural substrates. This suggests that human-introduced substrates may interfere with spiders' predatory performance. As human activities and habitat alteration are widespread, our findings highlight the need to consider the vibratory sensory channel in assessing anthropogenic impacts on wildlife. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Spider {{dragline}} silk {{features an}} unusual combination of high strength, extensibility and stiffness, which outperforms {{some of the}} best materials known in terms of its mechanical performance. It is as strong as high-carbon steel, has a higher extensibility than the best commercial nylon filaments, and is tougher than Kevlar. For these reasons, dragline silk serves as a benchmark of modern polymer fiber technology, and the mass-production of a biomimetic material is of high interest. Developing artificial silk, however, requires {{a better understanding of the}} underlying molecular structure of silk that leads to the mechanical properties and the mechanism by which nature assembles this structure. Therefore, the aim of this research work is to understand the unique mechanical properties of spider silk fibers using a bottom-up computational approach. The threads of the <b>European</b> <b>garden</b> <b>spider</b> Araneus diadematus, the most studied spider species, was considered for this work, more specifically the dragline spider silk. The hierarchical structure of dragline silk is composed of two major constituents, the amorphous phase and crystalline units, and its mechanical response has been attributed to these prime constituents. First, the mechanical behavior of the stiff crystalline units were analyzed from previous all atom simulations, and incorporated into finite element simulations. It is found that the strength of a silk fiber is mainly due to the embedded crystalline units, which are acting as crosslinks of silk proteins in the fiber. In contrast to crystalline units, the large extensibility and viscous behavior as evidenced by the time-dependency of silk mechanics in tensile loading is originated from the amorphous phase due to sliding of peptide chains, i. e., internal molecular friction. Beside these two major constituents of spider dragline silk, silk mechanics might also be influenced by the resistance against sliding of these two phases relative to each other under load. It is found that a perfectly relative horizontal motion has no significant resistance against sliding, however, slightly inclined loading causes measurable resistance. On the basis of modeling and numerical analysis of constituents of dragline silk, a three dimensional finite element model of a silk fiber is proposed. It is based on the secondary structure of the Araneus diadematus silk fiber, taking into account the plasticity of the β-sheet crystals as well as the viscous behavior of the amorphous matrix. The mechanical properties such as strength, extensibility, initial stiffness, post-stiffness, and toughness obtained from the finite element simulations show excellent agreement with available experimental data. An initially random distribution of crystals in the fiber silk rearranges during deformation, and forms a lamellar-like arrangement of the phases, which results in a high toughness. This work provides a fundamental understanding of silk's exceptional performance by linking the molecular properties and mechanisms to its macroscale mechanical behavior. The proposed computational models that encompass structure and mechanics at different scales in a bottom-up fashion, can assist the design of new materials that mimic and exceed the properties of biological analogs...|$|E
