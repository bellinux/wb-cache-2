50|$|Triphosphorus pentanitride {{currently}} has no large scale applications {{although it had}} found use as a <b>gettering</b> material for incandescent lamps; replacing various mixtures containing red phosphorus in the late 1960s. The lighting filaments are dipped into a suspension of P3N5 prior to being sealed into the bulb. After bulb closure, but whilst still on the pump, the lamps are lit, causing the P3N5 to thermally decompose into its constituent elements. Much of this is removed by the pump but enough P4 vapor remains to react with any residual oxygen inside the bulb. Once the vapor pressure of P4 is low enough either filler gas is admitted to the bulb prior to sealing off or, if a vacuum atmosphere is desired the bulb is sealed off at that point. The high decomposition temperature of P3N5 allows sealing machines to run faster and hotter than was possible using red phosphorus.|$|E
50|$|The gas in {{the tube}} {{has to be kept}} pure to {{maintain}} the desired properties; even small amount of impurities can dramatically change the tube values; presence of non-inert gases generally increases the breakdown and burning voltages. The presence of impurities can be observed by changes in the glow color of the gas. Air leaking into the tube introduces oxygen, which is highly electronegative and inhibits the production of electron avalanches. This makes the discharge look pale, milky, or reddish. Traces of mercury vapors glow bluish, obscuring the original gas color. Magnesium vapor colors the discharge green. To prevent outgassing of the tube components during operation, a bake-out is required before filling with gas and sealing. Thorough degassing is required for high-quality tubes; even as little as 10−8 torr (≈1 μPa) of oxygen is sufficient for covering the electrodes with monomolecular oxide layer in few hours. Non-inert gases can be removed by suitable getters. for mercury-containing tubes, getters that do not form amalgams with mercury (e.g. zirconium, but not barium) have to be used. Cathode sputtering may be used intentionally for <b>gettering</b> non-inert gases; some reference tubes use molybdenum cathodes for this purpose.|$|E

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of hydrogen is usually an undesirable occurrence because buildup in sealed systems pose explosion hazards under certain conditions. Hydrogen scavengers, or <b>getters,</b> can avert these problems by removing hydrogen from such environments. This paper provides {{a review of}} a number of reversible and irreversible <b>getters</b> that potentially could be used to reduce the buildup of hydrogen gas in containers for the transport of radioactive materials. In addition to describing <b>getters</b> that have already been used for such purposes, novel <b>getters</b> that might find application in future transport packages are also discussed. This paper also discusses <b>getter</b> material poisoning, the use of <b>getters</b> in packaging, the effects of radiation on <b>getters,</b> the compatibility of <b>getters</b> with packaging, design considerations, regulatory precedents, and makes general recommendations for the materials that have the greatest applicability in transport packaging. At this time, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory composite <b>getter,</b> DEB [1, 4 -(phenylethylene) benzene] or similar polymer-based <b>getters,</b> and a manganese dioxide-based <b>getter</b> appear to be attractive candidates that should be further evaluated. These <b>getters</b> potentially can help prevent pressurization from radiolytic reactions in transportation packaging...|$|R
50|$|When silicon {{is grown}} by the Czochralski method, the melt is {{contained}} in a silica (quartz) crucible. During growth, {{the walls of the}} crucible dissolve into the melt and Czochralski silicon therefore contains oxygen at a typical concentration of 10 cm. Oxygen impurities can have beneficial or detrimental effects. Carefully chosen annealing conditions can give rise to the formation of oxygen precipitates. These have the effect of trapping unwanted transition metal impurities in a process known as <b>gettering,</b> improving the purity of surrounding silicon. However, formation of oxygen precipitates at unintended locations can also destroy electrical structures. Additionally, oxygen impurities can improve the mechanical strength of silicon wafers by immobilising any dislocations which may be introduced during device processing. It was experimentally shown in the 1990s that the high oxygen concentration is also beneficial for the radiation hardness of silicon particle detectors used in harsh radiation environment (such as CERN's LHC/HL-LHC projects). Therefore, radiation detectors made of Czochralski- and Magnetic Czochralski-silicon are considered to be promising candidates for many future high-energy physics experiments. It has also been shown that the presence of oxygen in silicon increases impurity trapping during post-implantation annealing processes.|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of copper {{in the presence}} of a proximity <b>gettering</b> mechanism and a standard internal <b>gettering</b> mechanism in silicon was studied. He implantation-induced cavities in the near surface region were used as a proximity <b>gettering</b> mechanism and oxygen precipitates in the bulk of the material provided internal <b>gettering</b> sites. Moderate levels of copper contamination were introduced by ion implantation such that the copper was not supersaturated during the anneals, thus providing realistic copper contamination/gettering conditions. Copper concentrations at cavities and internal <b>gettering</b> sites were quantitatively measured after the annealings. In this manner, the <b>gettering</b> effectiveness of cavities was measured when in direct competition with internal <b>gettering</b> sites. The cavities were found to be the dominant <b>gettering</b> mechanism with only a small amount of copper gettered at the internal <b>gettering</b> sites. These results reveal the benefits of a segregation-type <b>gettering</b> mechanism for typical contamination conditions...|$|E
40|$|We present here {{experimental}} {{results on the}} <b>gettering</b> of iron in Czochralski-grown silicon by phosphorus implantation.

The results show that <b>gettering</b> in implanted emitters can be efficient if precipitation at the emitter is activated. This requires low <b>gettering</b> temperatures and/or high initial contamination level.

40|$|The {{removal of}} iron {{impurities}} to desired regions in silicon wafers {{has been studied}} using phosphorus and boron doped layers and bulk defects as <b>gettering</b> sites. Techniques to remove metal impurities, so-called <b>gettering</b> techniques, are needed for improving the performance of both the microelectronic and photovoltaic silicon devices, although the desired location of impurities may be different in various applications. In this work, both separate and simultaneous influences of the doped layers and bulk defects on the <b>gettering</b> behaviour of iron, e. g. the <b>gettering</b> efficiency and <b>gettering</b> mechanisms, were investigated. The phosphorus diffusion <b>gettering</b> studies at low temperatures enabled the determination of a more accurate segregation coefficient for iron between a phosphorus diffused layer and bulk silicon. Comparison between the phosphorus diffusion <b>gettering</b> experiments and similar experiments with boron showed that boron diffusion <b>gettering</b> can in some cases be nearly {{as effective as the}} phosphorus diffusion <b>gettering.</b> The <b>gettering</b> studies with implanted boron layers revealed that the <b>gettering</b> occurs also by precipitation, not only by segregation. Competitive <b>gettering</b> between an implanted boron layer and bulk defects was investigated using specially designed <b>gettering</b> anneals. It was found that depending on the desired location of iron in silicon wafers in different applications, iron can be collected either to the doped layers or the bulk defects. The <b>gettering</b> anneals were also applied to a microelectronic device process and their effect on the electronic device parameters was evaluated. These results contribute to the understanding of iron behaviour in silicon. Thus, they can help when designing the <b>gettering</b> anneals both for microelectronic and photovoltaic fabrication processes...|$|E

40|$|A new {{generation}} of irreversible, chemically reacting <b>getters</b> specifically targeted toward assuring {{the integrity of the}} local environment within microsystem packages were developed and evaluated. These reactive <b>getters</b> incorporate volatile species into a polymer through covalent bonds, thus producing a non-volatile product. These reactive <b>getters</b> will be combined with <b>getters</b> that rely on absorption media (e. g. zeolites and high surface area carbon fibers) to scavenge non-reactive species, like solvents. Our <b>getter</b> systems will rely on device packaging to limit exchange between the microsystem and the global environment. Thus, the internal <b>getters</b> need only provide local environmental control within the microsystem package. A series of experiments were conducted to determine uptake rates and capacities absorption and reactive-based <b>getters.</b> Diffusion rates through the binder used to hold the <b>getter</b> particles together were also investigated. <b>Getters</b> were evaluated in environments with a saturated headspace and with a limited amount of the volatile species of interest. One- and two-dimensional numerical models and analysis techniques have been developed and used to predict the transport of contaminant species within a representative microsystem package consisting of an open gas-filled volume adjacent to a polymer layer containing embedded particles of <b>getter.</b> The two-dimensional model features explicit representation of the individual <b>getter</b> particles while the one-dimensional treatment assumes a homogeneous distribution of <b>getter</b> material within the getterlpolymer layer. Example calculations illustrate the dependence of <b>getter</b> performance on reaction rates, polymer diffusivity, and <b>getter</b> particle volume fraction. In addition, the model is used to deduce surface reaction rates, solid phase diffusivities, and maximum-loading densities by least-squares fitting of model predictions to measured histories of gas-phase contaminant concentration and <b>getter</b> weight gain...|$|R
