Three basic heating modes are considered: (a) the heated wall is on the inflow side (assisting flow); (b) the heated wall is on the outflow side (opposing flow); and (c) the heated wall is the horizontal surface of the cavity (heating from below). Mixed convection fluid flow and heat transfer within the cavity is governed by the buoyancy parameter, Richardson number (Ri), and Reynolds number (Re). The results are reported in terms of streamlines, isotherms, wall temperature, and the velocity profiles in the cavity for Ri 0. 1 and 100, Re 100 and 1000, and the ratio between the channel and cavity heights (H=D) is in the range 0. 1 – 1. 5.

40|$|Rayleigh's {{problem of}} an {{infinite}} flat plate set into uniform motion impulsively {{in its own}} plane is studied by using Grad's equations and boundary conditions developed from the kinetic theory of gases. For a heat <b>insulated</b> <b>plate</b> and a small impulsive velocity (low Mach number), only tangential shear stress and velocity and energy (heat) flow parallel to the plate are generated, while the pressure, density, and temperature of the gas remain unchanged. Moreover, no normal velocity, normal stress, or normal energy flow is developed. Near {{the start of the}} motion the flow behaves like a "free-molecule flow", and all physical quantities are analytic functions of the flow parameters and time. The results obtained for "large time", however, add to the growing lack of confidence in the Burnett-type series expansions in powers of mean free path. Although such expansions are obtained here, they are poorly convergent and inappropriate to the problem. To replace these unsatisfactory solutions, approximate closed-form solutions valid for all values of the time are developed, which agree with the free-molecule values for small time and the classical Rayleigh solution for large time.

40|$|Summary. Tests {{have been}} made in the N. P. L. low-density tunnel at stream Mach numbers (M o) near 2 on a pressure-plotting flat plate with {{forward-facing}} steps. The step heights varied between 0. 1 in. and 0. 9 in., and the steps could be traversed along the plate surface to vary the distance from the leading edge Three stream static pressure levels (P 0) were chosen: 30, 50 and 70 microns of mercury, giving Reynolds numbers per inch between 98 and 281 [...] Initially the flat plate without step was investigated and it is shown that the pressure increase caused by the thick, rapidly-growing boundary layer could be estimated reasonably well over the front part of the plate by a tangent-wedge theory. Over the rear part of the plate this estimate was too high. Near the front of the plate the viscous interaction effect was in broad agreement with other tests at M o = 4 if the correlation was made in terms of the hypersonic parameter Z. The plate boundary layer was explored with a small pitot tube and its growth with distance from the leading edge was found to correspond to a simple law of familiar form.

The measurements {{have been carried out}} at different uniaxial stresses up to 2. 4 × 10 ^ 5 Pa applied along the c-axis normal to crystal layer's plane. It is revealed that the dielectric spectra of high-resistivity GaSe layered crystals with <b>insulating</b> <b>plates</b> obey a universal power law ∼ω^n- 1, where ω is the angular frequency and n≈ 0. 8, earlier observed on high-resistivity GaSe crystals with indium-soldered contacts. The same type of spectra on the crystals with different types of contacts (insulating and ohmic) confirms the bulk character of the observed polarization caused by hopping charge carriers.

A slight increase of power 1 -n with the stress is observed, that leads to a stronger dielectric dispersion.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was performed to better characterize the boundary conditions from an inconel heat source ('shroud') painted with Pyromark black paint. Quantifying uncertainties {{in this type of}} experimental setup is crucial to providing information for comparisons with code predictions. The characterization of this boundary condition has applications in many scenarios related to fire simulation experiments performed at Sandia National Laboratories Radiant Heat Facility (RHF). Four phases of experiments were performed. Phase 1 results showed that a nominal 1000 C shroud temperature is repeatable to about 2 C. Repeatability of temperatures at individual points on the shroud show that temperatures do not vary more than 10 C from experiment to experiment. This variation results in a 6 % difference in heat flux to a target 4 inches away. IR camera images showed the shroud was not at a uniform temperature, although the control temperature was constant to about {+-} 2 C during a test. These images showed that a circular shaped, flat shroud with its edges supported by an <b>insulated</b> <b>plate</b> has a temperature distribution with higher temperatures at the edges and lower temperatures in the center. Differences between the center and edge temperatures were up to 75 C. Phase 3 results showed that thermocouple (TC) bias errors are affected by coupling with the surrounding environment. The magnitude of TC error depends on the environment facing the TC. Phase 4 results were used to estimate correction factors for specific applications (40 and 63 -mil diameter, ungrounded junction, mineral insulated, metal-sheathed TCs facing a cold surface). Correction factors of about 3. 0 - 4. 5 % are recommended for 40 mil diameter TCs and 5. 5 - 7. 0 % for 63 mil diameter TCs. When mounted on the cold side of the shroud, TCs read lower than the 'true' shroud temperature, and the TC reads high when on the hot side. An alternate method uses the average of a cold side and hot side TC of the same size to estimate the true shroud temperature. Phase 2 results compared IR camera measurements with TC measurements and measured values of Pyromark emissivity. Agreement was within measured uncertainties of the Pyromark paint emissivity and IR camera temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{response}} of hot surfaces exposed to impinging jet fire and subsequent impacting water droplets is investigated. The research was done mainly experimentally by utilizing three different concepts. This included experiments on a laboratory scale steel plate and large outdoor fire tests with a quadratic steel channel and steel plates. Besides the horizontal jet flame itself was characterized {{in a comprehensive}} study. As a comparative study, the last three types of the experiment were additionally modeled by the CFD-code Kameleon FireEx for validation of results. Benchmark steel plate : The purpose of the experiments done on bench scale steel plate (L x W x T : 300 x 200 x 8 mm) was mainly to map data on wetting temperature, water droplet size, droplet impingement angle, and droplet velocity prior to large scale jet fire tests. The droplet release angle normal to hot surface gives best cooling effect, when the surface is oriented in upright position. The partial wetting begins at about 165 ºC. When the surface is positioned in horizontal plane, the droplet of about 5 mm in diameter wets the hot surface partially at around 240 – 250 ºC within an impaction distance of 20 cm. At about 150 ºC, the droplet is entirely attached to the surface with almost zero contact angle, and cools down the solid at a critical heat flux equivalent to 1750 kW/m 2. The cooling effectiveness is about 8 % with a Weber number of 68. Jet fire test with steel channel : Although {{in the event of}} horizontal channel (L x W x T : 1000 x 200 x 8 mm) water droplets were not applied,however, the knowledge gained with jet fire tests gave valuable information about temperature progress in solids (steels and insulation) and their response to impinging jet fire during long duration experiments. The temperature of the insulated area of the channel keeps 200 ºC below that of the exposed surface, as long as the insulation material remained intact. Upon long test fire durations, the insulation either burns or degrades despite protection in a metal encasing. This possibly reveals that the passive fire protection does not necessary guaranty the solids subjected to fire would survive, when the exposure time is extended, although in this study the surface keeps its consistency. Jet fire test with steel plates : Two types of plate (L xWx T : 300 x 300 x 10 mm) were employed, where one of them was insulated with 70 mm rockwool material on the rear side. Despite high elevated temperatures of the steel plates, one depressed the surface temperatures by water droplets from film boiling to nucleate boiling regime by a water mass flux of 4. 4 kg/m 2 s per plate, when spray nozzles were located outside the flame region. As the gas pressure was raised from 5 bar to 10 bar, the average critical heat flux for non-insulated and <b>insulated</b> <b>plate</b> increased by about 40 % to around 2100 kW/m 2 and 75 % to 2000 kW/m 2, respectively. While the average minimum heat flux increased approximately by 35 % to 410 kW/m 2 and 150 % to 380 kW/m 2, respectively. The radiation level on the surrounding area within a 3 m radial distance increases by a factor of 1. 5 – 2 upon increase of gas pressure. However, it drops by 25 % when deluge is applied, due to cooling of the flame. In case of spray nozzles located directly within the flame, the surface temperatures remained within nucleate boiling regime almost throughout the experiments. To ensure the temperatures are maintained at this regime, it requires a minimum mass flux of 1. 1 kg/m 2 s per plate. However, to keep the dry patches completely away, the flow rate needs to be fortified to about 2. 6 - 2. 7 kg/m 2 s. The average droplet size (SMD) in the event of earlier is around 650 μm, while that of the later is about 450 μm. Characterization of jet flame : The horizontal flame of concern was about 5. 5 m long, in addition to a lift-off distance of 60 cm. The warmest region of the flame is about 70 % downstream the visible length of the flame, with an average temperature of about 1100 ºC across the concerned cross section. The corresponding radiation at this section along the jet centerline is around 185 kW/m 2. While the radiation level at 1. 5 m radial distance outside the flame is about 50 kW/m 2. The highest temperature of the flame across almost any cross section is somewhere between the flame core and {{the outer edge of the}} flame. CFD verification : The CFD-code predicts well the exposed surface temperature of the steel channel, while that of the insulated area is predicted too high. The calculated surface temperature of the non-insulated steel plate is well comparable with that of the experiments, both before and after activation of deluge. But that of the <b>insulated</b> <b>plate</b> as well as the insulatio...|$|E
40|$|For {{activities}} with increased safety, like nuclear power plants, {{it is important}} to investigate a proper safety distance from a fire with known characteristics. Depending on the ignition temperature and thermal properties such as the thermal conductivity k, density ρ and specific heat capacity C for the surrounding material, different safety distances will be derived. This can be made by investigating the temperature and incoming radiation to a surface. There are several different ways to determine the temperature and radiation like computer programs, hand calculations or performing a full-scale experiment. The aim of this thesis is to determine the adiabatic surface temperature (AST) and radiation at different distances from a fire with a given effect, resulting in a safety distance. This will be made by examine differences in results between full-scale experiments, an excel-application based on hand-calculations and the computer programme Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). The excel-application calculates the incident radiation and the AST. The hand-calculations that are used in the excel-application are based on different parameters and formulas, such as the combustion efficiency of the flame, how sooty the flame is and the view factor. Three different full-scale experiments are made at SP Fire Research in Borås which are based on an earlier written report which used FDS to determine a safety distance. These three experiments were: a flame freely placed in a room, flame against a wall and flame in a corner. Several 30 mm <b>insulated</b> <b>plate</b> thermometers were used during these experiments on different heights to get the AST. The propane burner had an effect of 500 kW and a safety distance was measured based on chosen criteria. These criteria’s were met when the temperature of the instrument reached 205 °C or was exposed to an incident radiation of 6 kW/m 2. This temperature and incident radiation is based on research done by Electric Power Research institute (EPRI) [1]. The values are damage criteria’s identified for when ignition is identified on thermoplastic cables. For the full-scale experiments a significantly higher temperature was achieved when the burner was placed next to a wall or a corner compared to when the burner was placed freely. There was no bigger temperature difference if the burner was placed against a wall or a corner. The results from the excel-application corresponded well to the full-scale experiments and therefore similar safety distances were given. For the full-scale experiments the safety distance was reached at a distance of 0. 85 - 1. 35 m {{from the edge of the}} burner for the free flame and 1. 85 m when the flame was placed against a wall or when the flame was placed in the corner. For the excel-application the safety distances were 1. 2 m respectively 2. 0 m for the free flame and the flame against the wall. No calculations were made for flame in corner due to the fact that there was no remarkable temperature difference compared to the flame against the wall. These results can be compared to FDS where the safety distances were the same for all cases, 1. 5 m. Validerat; 20151006 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

Erasmus Darwin, W. Wilson, G. C. Bohnenberger, and (later, 1841) J. C. E. Péclet developed various modifications of Bennet's device. Francis Ronalds automated the generation process in 1816 by adapting a pendulum bob as one of the plates, driven by clockwork or a steam engine – he created the device to power his electric telegraph. In 1788, William Nicholson proposed his rotating doubler, which can be considered as the first rotating influence machine. His instrument was described as [...] "an instrument which by turning a winch produces the two states of electricity without friction or communication with the earth". (Phil. Trans., 1788, p.403) Nicholson later described [...] a [...] "spinning condenser" [...] apparatus, as a better instrument for measurements.|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{describes the}} use of polyurethane (PUR) as an insulation material for flat roofs. The advantages of PUR are: low thermal conductivity, thermal behaviour and compressive strength. PUR rigid foam insulating materials are offered with aluminium surface layers with a thickness greater than 80 mm and in the thermal conductivity stage WLS 024. In {{the first part of}} this contribution, the architectural and building physical requirements from standards and technical rules are described: Energy Conservation Ordinance (EnEV), minimum requirements to the characteristics of rigid foam insulating materials, flame behaviour of <b>insulating</b> <b>plates.</b> The second part of this contribution describes the thermal insulation of ventilated and non-ventilated flat roofs (flat roofs with standard version, sanitation of flat roofs with PUR insulation, sloping roof, terrace roof, parking decks). It follows recommendations regarding to the laying out of insulation plates advantages of the PUT rigid foam insulation of flat roofs, quality control of PUR rigid foam insulating materials and a description of the technical and physical properties of PUR rigid foam.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the natural convection behavior of air when heated in single vertical, parallel-plate channels. To enhance the heat transfer two passive schemes are combined: (1) an equidistant short plate is inserted at the inlet and (2) two parallel, colinear <b>insulated</b> <b>plates</b> are appended at the exit. The channel plates are symmetrically heated with a uniform heat flux. The computational procedure {{is made by}} solving the full elliptic Navier - Stokes and energy equations with the finite-volume methodology in an I-type computational domain that is {{much larger than the}} physical domain. Within the framework of a "proof-of-concept" the controlling Grashof number based on the heated plate height ranges between 10 (3) and 10 (6). The numerical velocity, pressure and temperature fields are post-processed to compute the quantities of engineering interest such as the induced mass flow rate, the pressure at the channel mid-plane and the temperature along the plates. In addition, the Nusselt number and the average Nusselt number, both based on the heated plate height, are presented in graphical form. At the end, optimal channel configurations expressed in terms of the highest average Nusselt number are obtained for the pair of pre-assigned Grashof numbers...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} laws of {{conservation}} of momentum and angular momentum in classical electrodynamics of material media with bound charges, and explore the possibility to describe the properties of such media via a discrete set of point-like charges of zero size (as imposed by special relativity), and via continuous charge/current distributions. This way we put a question: {{do we have to}} recognize the infinite fields at the location of elementary charges as the essential physical requirement, or such infinite fields can be ignored via introduction of continuous charge distribution? In order to answer this question, we consider the interaction of a homogeneously charged <b>insulating</b> <b>plate</b> with a compact magnetic dipole, moving along the plate. We arrive at the apparent violation of the angular momentum conservation law and show that this law is re-covered, when the electric field at the location of each elementary charge of the plate is taken infinite. This result signifies that the description of electromagnetic properties of material media via the continuous charge and current distributions is not a universal approximation, and at the fundamental level, {{we have to deal with}} a system of elementary discrete charges of zero size, at least in the analysis of laws of conservation of momentum and angular momentum.
