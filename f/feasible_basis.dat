40|$|A special type {{of linear}} {{programming}} problem that arises quite frequently in practical application is the transportation problem. The transportation problem involves determining a shipping schedule that minimizes {{the total cost}} of shipment given that there are known fixed quantities of a commodity available for shipment at each origin, there are given quantities of a commodity required to be shipped at each destination, and the total shipments from all origins equal the total requirements of all destinations. It is assumed that the minimum cost of shipping a unit of commodity from any origin to any destination is known, and total shipping cost is obtained by taking the sum of individual cost;The algorithm used for finding an optimal solution requires that an initial basic feasible solution must first be determined. The algorithm improves this solution at each iteration, resulting in a total shipping cost that is {{less than or equal to}} the total cost in the previous iteration, until an optimal solution is found. There are different procedures for determining an initial <b>feasible</b> <b>basis.</b> Each of these procedures can give a different initial <b>feasible</b> <b>basis</b> that corresponds to varying total costs, and also takes varying amount of computational time in obtaining an initial <b>feasible</b> <b>basis.</b> A comparison of the various start procedures was conducted to determine the procedure that would give the best initial <b>feasible</b> <b>basis,</b> that is, one that is close to the optimum and does not use up a lot of CPU time in finding one. As a result of this study, it was determined that for large rectangular transportation problems the Large Amount Low Cost method would give the best initial <b>feasible</b> <b>basis,</b> and for square and not very rectangular problems, the Modified Minimum Row rule is best;The methods for solving transportation problems can be applied to solve some statistical problems.

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} origins and {{implications}} of (finite) criss-cross methods in linear programming and related problems. Most pivot algorithms, like Dantzig's celebrated Simplex method, need a <b>feasible</b> <b>basis</b> to start with; when the basis is changed, feasibility is preserved until optimality or unboundedness is detected. To obtain a <b>feasible</b> <b>basis</b> a so-called first phase problem must be solved. On the contrary, a criss-cross method is a pivot algorithm that solves the linear programming problem in one phase without preserving possible feasibility of the intermediate solutions. Getting free from the necessity of preserving feasibility and monotonicity needs a fresh view on algorithmic concepts, it raises new questions and opens new perspectives. After a brief introduction and historical review a finite criss-cross algorithm is presented. Via alternative finiteness proofs {{the flexibility of the}} method is explored.

Positional information is thus generated at the boundaries between cells of different determination. The latter are assumed to result from the primary pattern formation in the embryo. The application of this model to vertebrate limbs accounts for the pairwise determination of limbs at a par-ticular location, with a particular handedness and alignment to the main body axes of the embryo. It accounts further for the gross difference in the regeneration of double anterior and double posterior amphibian limbs {{as well as for}} the formation of supernumerary limbs after certain graft experiments including supernumeraries in which the dorsoventral polarity changes or which consist of two anterior or two posterior halves.

Piezoelectric patches acting as sensors and actuators are employed. The equations of motion are derived by using Lagrange's equation with vibration mode shapes as the Ritz functions. The number of sensors/actuators and their location is variable. The set of equations obtained is then transformed into state variables and some initial controller design studies are undertaken.
