2500|$|Glen Gamboa of Newsday {{gave the}} song a {{negative}} review, commenting that [...] "She holds back {{for much of}} the song, with its airy chorus and moments where it seems ready to launch into a much broader anthem, but instead stays on a sleek, unpredictable line. Would <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> if it blossomed into [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] like it wants to? Maybe." [...] Kyle Anderson from Entertainment Weekly gave the song a positive review, writing [...] "Lopez once again sings over a buttery disco groove with an assist from Miami’s favorite bilingual MC." [...] Anderson noted that the chorus of the song is [...] "as pure a piece of effervescent pop as Lopez has ever been a part of, and while it probably isn’t the sort of thing meant to be listened to on headphones in a cubicle, it should play pretty well in places where grinding is encouraged (like clubs in Ibiza, and middle school dances)." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 201, after Cao Cao {{defeated}} his northern rival Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, he sent Zhang Liao {{to pacify}} the various counties in Lu State, and then ordered him and Xiahou Yuan to lead an army {{to attack a}} minor warlord Chang Xi (昌豨) in Donghai Commandery (東海郡; around present-day Linyi, Shandong). Zhang Liao and Xiahou Yuan had besieged Chang Xi for months but were unable to defeat him and their supplies were running out, so they considered retreating. Zhang Liao told Xiahou Yuan, [...] "Over the past several days, whenever we attacked Chang Xi, I noticed he paid careful attention to me. He's also running short of arrows. I suspect he's having doubts, therefore he isn't {{doing his best to}} resist us. Wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> if I manage to persuade him to surrender?" [...] He then sent a message to Chang Xi and asked to speak to him. When Zhang Liao met Chang Xi, he told the latter that Cao Cao rewarded those who submitted to him. Convinced by Zhang Liao, Chang Xi agreed to surrender to Cao Cao. Zhang Liao then went to Chang Xi's home alone and visited his family. Chang Xi was delighted and he followed Zhang Liao and Xiahou Yuan back to meet Cao Cao.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, {{the then}} Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, long in {{conflict}} with the London Evening Standard, then wholly owned by the same media group as the Mail, branded the Mail titles [...] "the most reprehensibly edited" [...] publications in the world. The Mail's treatment of asylum seekers and members of other vulnerable groups is a particular source of grievance for many critics, not only Livingstone. [...] "Maybe we anti-racists have been naive to think that [...] was anything more than an aberration," [...] suggests Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, adding: [...] "wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> if this extraordinary editor decided to use his influence to create just a little more understanding of why refugees leave their countries, and what most of them bring to our nation?" [...] Stephen Fry in August 2013 called Dacre a [...] "frothing autocrat" [...] and hypocrite who [...] "sends his son to Eton" [...] but mocked Fry [...] "for being posh". Fry added: [...] "He decries indecency on one page and pushes his male readers into a semi over a semi-nude actress on another. His cancer scare, miracle cure stories are sickeningly anti-science and the only good thing to be said about his Mail is that no one decent or educated believes in it". Dacre's defence against his paper's critics in October 2013 was to decry the existence of [...] "an unpleasant intellectual snobbery about the Mail in leftish circles, for whom the word 'suburban' is an obscenity. They simply cannot comprehend how a paper that opposes the mindset they hold dear can be so successful and so loved by its millions of readers. Well, I'm proud that the Mail stands up for those readers".|$|E
