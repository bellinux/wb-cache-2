5|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} grief {{caused by the}} death of her two children, Mary Shelley continued to study and read as she had throughout her life. Between 1818 and 1820, she exposed herself to quite a bit of drama. She read many of William Shakespeare's plays, some with Percy Shelley. Percy believed that Mary had a talent for drama and convinced her to study the great English, French, Latin, and Italian plays as well as <b>drama</b> <b>theory.</b> He even sought her advice regarding his play The Cenci. Less glamorously, Mary transcribed the manuscript of Percy's drama Prometheus Unbound. The Shelleys also attended operas, ballets, and plays.|$|E

50|$|The {{relation}} between <b>drama</b> <b>theory</b> and game theory is complementary in nature. Game theory {{does not explain}} how the game that is played is arrived at - i.e., how players select a small number of players and strategies from the virtually infinite set they could select, and how they arrive at common knowledge about each other's selections and preferences for the resulting combinations of strategies. <b>Drama</b> <b>theory</b> tries to explain this, and also to explain how the 'focal point' is arrived at for the 'game with a focal point' that is finally played. On the other hand, <b>drama</b> <b>theory</b> {{does not explain how}} players will act when they finally have to play a particular 'game with a focal point', even though it has to make assumptions about this. This is what game theory tries to explain and predict.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a robot architecture which allows the robot to be perceived as a social agent. The proposed architecture autonomously allocates computational resources to different activities via an evaluation of environmental stimuli and robot state based on an emotional model of attention and effort. Moreover, the robot carries out a dramatization of its own work, according to <b>drama’s</b> <b>theory</b> and its emotions. The architecture has been tested in a project regarding a robotic touristic guide acting in the Botanical Garden of the University of Palermo.
