40|$|Heat {{decarbonisation}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} challenges of energy system decarbonisation. However, existing energy planning models struggle to compare heat decarbonisation approaches because they rarely capture trade-offs between heat supply, end-use technologies and network infrastructure at sufficient spatial resolution. A new optimisation model is presented that addresses this by including trade-offs between gas, electricity, and heat infrastructure, together with related supply and end-use technologies, with high spatial granularity. The model is applied in case studies for the UK. For the case modelled it is shown that electrification of heat is most cost-effective via district level heat pumps that supply heat networks, instead of individual building heat pumps. This is because the cost of reinforcing the electricity grid for installing individual heat pumps does not sufficiently offset heat infrastructure costs. This demonstrates the importance of considering infrastructure trade-offs. When modelling the utilisation of a <b>decarbonised</b> <b>gas,</b> the penetration of heat networks and location of district level heat supply technologies was shown to be dependent on linear heat density and on zone topology. This shows the importance of spatial aspects. Scenario-specific linear heat density thresholds for heat network penetration were identified. For the base case, penetration of high temperature heat networks was over 50 % and 60 % by 2050 for linear heat densities over 1500 and 2500 kWh/m. For the case when medium heat temperature networks were additionally available, a mix of both networks was observed. Medium temperature heat network penetration was over 20 %, 30 %, and 40 % for linear heat densities of over 1500, 2500, and 3000 kWh/m, while high temperature heat network penetration was over 20 % and 30 % for linear heat densities of under 2000 and 1500 kWh/m respectively...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this presentation, the {{opportunities}} for pre-combustion capture of fuel gas at a world-scale manufacturing complex will be evaluated. The work focusses on <b>decarbonising</b> fuel <b>gas</b> at a central location in a manufacturing complex to create a hydrogen rich fuel gas pool ready for use in existing or slightly modified heating equipment and a high pressure CO 2 stream ready for storage. Evaluations are based on current reforming and gasification technologies in combination with available gas treating line-ups, {{as well as new}} line-ups with emerging gas separation technologies, like high temperature membranes. Dependent on the local process boundary conditions (sweet or sour fuel gas) one or more technologies can be suitable. Current conclusion is that the concept of pre- combustion capture at a world scale manufacturing location is feasible with available technologies. It is advised to demonstrate at a scale which is sufficiently large to evaluate the performance and reliability of the individual technologies as well as the complexity of integration with the manufacturing. This presentation will reveal some of the technology aspects regarding the minimum scale for a demo regarding membrane technology. Several membrane based process schemes have been short listed for these fuel decarbonisation demonstration projects. Recovery of CO 2 at high pressure and high purity (> 90 mol%) as well as carbon conversions in excess of equilibrium limits may be achieved using various process schemes patented by Shell [1, 2]. Successful evaluations of CRI/Criterion H 2 separation membranes in membrane steam reformers and as high temperature membrane separators have been performed by CRI/Criterion [3]. These membranes can be produced with a hydrogen permeance in the range of 50 - 70 [Nm 3 /m 2. h. bar 0. 5]. Both the hydrogen flux and the separation selectivity are stable at temperatures of 300 - 500 oC and large differential pressures (tested up to 68 bar). H 2 purity of > 99 % has been demonstrated for long periods (over 1 year) in high temperature gas separations...|$|R
