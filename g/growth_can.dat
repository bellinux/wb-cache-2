5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their <b>growth</b> <b>can</b> be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
50|$|Kidney tumours (or kidney tumors), {{also known}} as renal tumours, are tumours, or growths, on or in the kidney. These <b>growths</b> <b>can</b> be benign or {{malignant}} (kidney cancer).|$|R

5|$|Lung cancer, {{also known}} as lung carcinoma, is a {{malignant}} lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. This <b>growth</b> <b>can</b> spread beyond the lung {{by the process of}} metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains.|$|E

As of October 2007, the Bank has a staff of more than 24,703 employees; its 2,468 branches provide services to 80,257 villages, up from the 43,681 villages covered in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{considers}} the laws governing {{the shapes of}} cells, at least in simple cases such as the fine hairs (a cell thick) in the rhizoids of mosses. He analyses the geometry of cells in a frog's egg when it has divided into 4, 8 and even 64 cells. He shows that uniform <b>growth</b> <b>can</b> lead to unequal cell sizes, and argues that the way cells divide {{is driven by the}} shape of the dividing structure (and not vice versa).|$|E
50|$|The only visible sign of {{cutaneous}} fibroma in {{white-tailed deer}} are fleshy wart-like growths on the skin, which are likely caused by biting insects. These <b>growths</b> <b>can</b> vary from individual growths to clusters of warts. These warts can also vary {{in size from}} small to very large. Because these growths are only attached to the skin, not to the underlying muscle and bone, they actually have no physical effects on the deer itself. These tumors or warts may however impair the ability to see, eat, or run if they are large enough to inhibit normal behavior. Deer with these <b>growths</b> <b>can</b> still be in perfect health and will show no symptoms of ill health.|$|R
5000|$|Subserosal fibroids {{are located}} {{on the surface of}} the uterus. They can also grow outward from the surface and remain {{attached}} by a small piece of tissue and then are called pedunculated fibroids. [...] These pedunculated <b>growths</b> <b>can</b> actually detach from the uterus to become a parasitic leiomyoma.|$|R
50|$|Growth Centers {{is an area}} in {{the bone}} that {{controls}} the overall growth of the bone from its locations through different signaling mechanisms. Growth at these centers are genetically controlled. All <b>growth</b> centers <b>can</b> be <b>growth</b> sites but not all <b>growth</b> sites <b>can</b> be <b>growth</b> centers. Some examples include membranous bones of cranium, mandibular condyle.|$|R
5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. <b>Growth</b> <b>can</b> be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E
5|$|P.atriplicifolia is {{frequently}} propagated by cuttings. Because its woody crown is resistant to division, softwood cuttings {{are taken from}} shoots near the base, generally in late spring. Hardwood cuttings selected in mid-to-late summer also provide a viable propagation technique. The plant is also grown from seed in cultivation. Such seeds require exposure to cold for 30–160 days to germinate, and seed-raised specimens may not preserve the characteristics of named cultivars. In the commercial greenhouse or nursery setting, P.atriplicifolia relatively large size and rapid <b>growth</b> <b>can</b> adversely affect quality or make plants more difficult and expensive to transport; the use of plant growth regulators such as chlormequat chloride and daminozide may be more cost-effective than large-scale pruning.|$|E
5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any {{treatment}} prior to planting, and take 26 to 40 days to germinate. Seeds that grow into yellow-flowered plants are pale and unpigmented, while future bronze- and red-flowered plants are dark greyish and black respectively. It generally takes about {{five to seven years}} to flower from seed. The plant favours sandy well-drained soils and a sunny position and can be heavily pruned if necessary, as new <b>growth</b> <b>can</b> arise from the lignotuber. Although it is readily propagated by seed, experiments with in vitro propagation found Banksia menziesii to be more difficult than other species trialled.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} gases {{in any given}} tissue depend {{on the history of}} pressure and gas composition. Under equilibrium conditions, the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the ambient pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction in ambient pressure, the rate of pressure reduction may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues. When the pressure of gases in a bubble exceed the combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface, the bubbles grow, and this <b>growth</b> <b>can</b> damage tissue.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is white; spores are {{cylindrical}}, smooth, and measure 7–11 by 2–3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have a shape ranging from cylindrical to club-shaped, and dimensions of 20–40 by 3–5μm. The hymenium features numerous hyphidia (modified terminal hyphae), which measure 2–3μm. The hyphal system of Daedaleopsis confragrosa is trimitic, meaning {{that there are}} three types of hyphae in the fruit body: skeletal hyphae, which provide structural support, are thick walled, measuring 3–7μm in diameter; generative hyphae, responsible for new <b>growth,</b> <b>can</b> be either thin- or thick-walled, may contain clamps, and measure 2–6μm; binding hyphae, thick-walled and much branched, are 2–5μm.|$|E
