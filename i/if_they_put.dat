5|$|A new Zelda {{title was}} first hinted at in April 2008, when Miyamoto {{stated that the}} Zelda {{development}} team were reforming to create new games. Miyamoto later confirmed at the 2008 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that a new Zelda was in development for the Wii. The game was officially unveiled at E3 2009, although its official title remained unknown. Due to its in-development state, Miyamoto could not show off gameplay as he had wished. Instead, he showed promotional art featuring Link and Fi. He also announced the game's use of Wii MotionPlus, along with its planned 2010 release window. In a later interview, Aonuma's comments on the game's playability brought this release window into doubt. He also noted that his wish {{to focus on the}} new game meant that the release date of Spirit Tracks was shifted to the end of 2009 rather than its initial projected release in early 2010. The game's official title was announced at the event, along with its revised release period in 2011 and a playable demonstration. According to Miyamoto, the game was delayed from its planned 2010 release window as the staff felt that they would be releasing an unfinished product <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> the convenience of the company ahead of creating a quality experience. They used the extra year to both finish the core elements and polish up the game as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Fergus and Mandy try to {{reassemble}} {{the broken}} {{pieces of the}} mirror. Fergus has the idea that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> the pieces together on their side the mirror will repair itself on the other side. It works. While in the Hall of Mirrors, a kind woman appears to Daniel and Constance. She tells Constance she was right to steal the crown as the heir is dead. She also reveals that the crown {{can make a difference}} to the future. Meanwhile, in 1867 Gervais strikes gold, meaning he no longer has any need to sell the crown. The mirror appears and Constance goes through. Upon her return, Constance discovers that her father has entrusted the crown to her to do as she sees fit, but before she can arrange this with her friends in the 1990s, the mirror vanishes, signifying the end of their adventures. Back in 1997, Daniel, Fergus and Mandy visit Constance's grave and discover a clue to the location of the crown. Someone arrives and gives them a letter from Constance. The letter states that they are the new proprietors of the Crown Foundation. Now that their adventures had come to an end, Daniel decides to go back home and stay with this mum.|$|E
500|$|Talk of {{a canopy}} or halo {{to protect the}} driver was {{accelerated}} by the fatal Formula One accident that killed Jules Bianchi in October 2014 and an incident where Justin Wilson was fatally struck {{in the head by}} debris during an IndyCar race in August 2015. In particular, following Wilson's death, Allmendinger stated that he would [...] "never again" [...] run open-wheel cars, adding [...] "The only way I would do it is <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> in a closed cockpit over the car and tested it and they thought that was a good direction in safety then I might think about doing it again." [...] As a result, several major open-wheel series have implemented cockpit protection systems, with Formula One, Formula Two, and Formula Three all planning to introduce the halo for the 2018 motorsport season.|$|E

60|$|But {{the commanders}} of the British ships were brave men. They {{had started to}} run down the strangely {{armoured}} American craft, and run her down <b>they</b> would, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> could. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> on more steam, and went ahead at greater speed. In such a furious onslaught the crabs might not dare to attack them.|$|R

500|$|The episode {{opens with}} a musical number in which the members of Quahog sing about what they want for Christmas. Peter wishes to have actress and models Jessica Biel and Megan Fox. He also wishes {{to have lunch with}} Michael Landon's ghost and wants twelve kegs of beer. Lois wishes to visit the Spanish coasts, and [...] "Mexico, [...] with two black guys and some blow". Chris wishes for Jennifer Garner and Meg wishes for a Lexus. The neighbors of Quahog also wish for gifts: Herbert wishes for a drummer boy (there is a picture of singer Nick Jonas on the wall while he wishes for this), Mayor Adam West wishes for a tinkertoy, Carl wishes for a Blu-ray version of The Wiz and Consuela wishes for more Lemon Pledge. Continuing with the song, Jillian Russell wishes for Easter eggs, Joe wishes for one day when kids don't stare at him, Bonnie wants platinum-plated silverware, Quagmire wants [...] "Japanese girls of no restraint" [...] to choke him and then whip him and Mort (who is Jewish) says he will sue <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> a Christmas tree in the airport. The song ends with various {{characters}} appearing in an advent calendar.|$|E
2500|$|People {{could simply}} feel [...] "lost in the crowd", so {{they feel that}} their effort would not be rewarded even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> it forth. This idea can also cause people to {{feel as though they}} can simply [...] "hide in the crowd" [...] and avoid the averse effects of not {{applying}} themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Young {{changed the}} C's herald (logo) to [...] "C for Progress" [...] to embody his ideas that C {{would lead the}} {{industry}} to a new day. He installed a well-staffed research and development department, which came up with ideas for passenger service that {{are thought to be}} futuristic even now, and for freight service that would challenge the growth of trucking. Fortune magazine wrote, [...] "Young has an almost endless inventory of ideas, some pneumatic and some substantial, about passenger service. He believes that the railroads could double any previous passenger revenues <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> out a good product and merchandised it well..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ron locked horns {{again with}} Clive Davis for 3 months over Silverstein’s Cover of the Rolling Stone {{because of the}} lyrics [...] "We take all kinds of pills to get all kinds of thrills" [...] and [...] "I got a freaky old lady named Cocaine Katy". Ron knew that <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> out another Sylvia’s Mother… Dr. Hook would be finished! Clive told the label to release it. Ron, against all {{opinions}} asked that nothing else be done to the song stating, [...] "it’s perfect {{just the way it}} is". The Cover of the Rolling Stone was not their biggest hit, {{but it turned out to}} be the most significant song of Dr. Hook’s career.|$|E
2500|$|Freiman {{played for}} Israel at the 2013 World Baseball Classic {{qualifier}} in September 2012. Manager Brad Ausmus started {{him at first}} base and batted him third in the lineup. Of his five hits while batting [...]417, four were home runs. During the opening game, against South Africa, Zeid went 2 for 5, with both of his hits being 2-out solo homeruns. During the second game, against Spain, Freiman went 2 for 4, with both of his hits being two-run homeruns. During Israel's third game, the qualifying game against Spain, Freiman went 1 for 3 with an RBI and two walks, while scoring a run and {{being hit by a}} pitch. Israel lost to Spain in extra innings in the pool finals, just missing making the World Baseball Classic. [...] Freiman said: [...] "It was heartbreaking, but hopefully <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> together another team I’ll be a part of it. It was a fantastic experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|During week four, on Day 25 housemates {{were set}} a {{patience}} and endurance task, The Waiting Game, where {{they all had}} to stand on a podium to win a reward in the Box of Good Things. Housemates were permitted to quit <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> their hand up and state their reasons, and if their feet touched the floor they were automatically out of the game. After drawing straws with Grace, Lisa was the housemate on her podium the longest, {{with a total of}} 10 hours and 12 minutes, and her prize was immunity from nominations. Big Brother imposed [...] "The State of Susie", the House was adorned with images and statues of Susie, making Susie the leader of a [...] "dictatorship" [...] and the other housemates her followers. The weekly task was failed four hours after it began. Thirty-three fails were recorded, thirty more than were allowed. Susie, the only housemate allowed to nominate, chose Grace and Nikki for the public vote. On Day 30 Grace was evicted with 87.9% of the public vote.|$|E

2500|$|In McManaman's final {{games for}} the club {{in the second half}} of the 1998–99 season, he began turning in mixed performances, with the media accusing him of playing out his final season in a [...] "desultory manner". His form dipped at times, arguably due to a {{combination}} of injuries, being restricted to substitute appearances (as Houllier wanted to cut the side's dependency on his gameplay and replace him), and loss of confidence in certain games where even the home fans turned against him over the contract debacle, with some labelling him a [...] "traitor" [...] and a Judas figure. McManaman told the media after one such game where he became victim of the [...] "boo boys", saying, [...] "That's understandable, when I came off the other day I knew the reaction there was going to be. But I think <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> themselves in the same predicament, and the fact that I have been at Liverpool for 12 years and that I would like to test myself in a foreign country, that's understandable." ...|$|E
