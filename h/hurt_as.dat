5|$|The {{next day}} {{as part of}} his promise to Bhuvan, Lakha takes a diving one-handed catch. However, the British score almost 300 runs, losing only three wickets by the lunch break. Kachra is brought back to bowl and, bowling with a now-worn ball, takes a hat-trick, which sparks the {{collapse}} of the British batting side. The villagers soon start their innings. Bhuvan and Deva (a Sikh, who has played cricket earlier when he was a British sepoy) give their team a solid start. Deva misses out on his half-century when a straight-drive from Bhuvan ricochets off the bowler's hand onto the stumps at the non-striker's end, where Deva is backing up too far. When Lakha comes on to bat, he is hit on the head by a bouncer and falls onto his stumps. Other batsmen get out rashly trying to score a boundary off each delivery. Ismail (Raj Zutshi), a good batsman, retires <b>hurt</b> <b>as</b> he is hit on the leg. The villagers' team ends the day with four batsmen out of action with barely a third of the required runs on board.|$|E

25|$|Burke {{struggled}} in the First Test, scoring 16 and 10 retired <b>hurt</b> <b>as</b> South Africa held {{the upper hand}} {{for most of the}} drawn match. However, he recovered in time for the Second Test at Cape Town in the following week. He reverted to his dour, watchful style, and his 189, his highest Test score, took 578 minutes. It laid the foundation for an innings victory after South Africa were forced to follow on. After making 86 against Transvaal, Burke scored 83 in the second innings of the drawn Third Test in Durban. He had made only two in the first innings and Australia were in trouble after the hosts took a 221-run lead, but his second effort helped Australia to 7/292 and avoid defeat. His 81 in the first innings of the Fourth in Johannesburg helped set up a ten-wicket victory, and an unassailable 2–0 series lead. Burke made only eight in the Fifth Test, but Australia were able to seal the series with an eight-wicket win.|$|E

In No Good Deed, Naomi decides to plan Mitchell Nash's daughters sweet sixteen birthday party, after a previous client told her she would not hire her without her having any professional experiences.|$|E
25|$|Elisabeth Rynning, a {{professor}} of medical law at the University of Uppsala, questioned whether the court had been {{fully aware of the}} relevant laws. Access to these kinds of records may only be granted for the purpose of research or for the collection of statistics. Elinder had not stated any such purpose in his application, and Kärfve had only argued that the material would be useful for her research, not that it would actually be used in a research project. She was in fact not allowed to use the material in her research project, since that would have required a previous approval by an ethics committee. There was also the problem that Elinder and Kärfve requested the material as private citizens, {{while at the same time}} stating that they needed it in their professional capacities. If they had requested the material as representatives of their employers, the court would not have jurisdiction. Finally Rynning questioned how the court could decide that no one would be <b>hurt,</b> <b>as</b> the law requires, if Elinder and Kärfve were given full access to the data. Several participants had testified to the court that they would be deeply offended and hurt if Elinder and Kärfve could read their medical records.|$|E
