40|$|Abstract. To {{verify the}} {{conditions}} and the possible use of the historical buildings, it is fundamental to individuate structural patterns really near to each particular configuration. The calculation of a <b>double</b> <b>warp</b> ceiling usually supposes that the secondary warp structure simply leans upon the principal beams. Principal beams, on their turn, can lean or seldom be lodged into the walls. These conditions are usual in the most simple ceilings, but they cannot merely {{be transferred to the}} most riches and complex constructions. In the case of Palazzo Pallavicino in Cremona were inserted on some beams between the joists wooden blocks, forming a veritable reinforced beam. Verification to calculation of these reinforced beams gave load values eligible for the new public destination. The old system has served as a model for consolidation, and allowed minimal intervention and avoided the introduction of incongruous material...|$|E

Stage 1 was a split {{course that}} shared {{the first two}} {{obstacles}} (long jump, log grip), but then split into stage 1A and stage 1B. The obstacles on each side were different, and the top 20 fastest times on each side advanced to stage 2. In stage 2, common sasuke obstacles (salmon ladder, <b>double</b> <b>warped</b> wall) appeared, and competitors had 100 seconds to clear this stage. Only 8 competitors made it to stage 3, which featured typical stage 3 obstacles: pole maze, spinning bridge, rumbling dice, spider flip, cliffhanger, and pipe slider. All competitors failed on stage 3, with Le Van Thuc making it the furthest (failed dismounting onto the platform from the pipe slider).|$|R
40|$|We readdress the {{problems}} associated with bulk Higgs and the gauge fields in a 5 -dimensional Randall-Sundrum model by extending the model to six dimensions with <b>double</b> <b>warping</b> along the two extra spatial dimensions. In this 6 -dimensional model we have a freedom of two moduli scales as against one modulus in the 5 -dimensional model. With a little hierarchy between these moduli we can obtain the right magnitude for $W$ and $Z$ boson masses from the Kaluza-Klein modes of massive bulk gauge fields where the spontaneous symmetry breaking is triggered by bulk Higgs. We also have determined the gauge couplings of the standard model fermions with Kaluza-Klein modes of the gauge fields. Unlike the case of 5 -dimensional model with a massless bulk gauge field, here we have shown that the gauge couplings and the masses of the Kaluza-Klein gauge fields satisfy the precision electroweak constraints and also obey the Tevatron bounds.

40|$|In {{the same}} sense that AdS_ 5 warped {{geometries}} arise naturally from Type IIB string theory with stacks of D 3 branes, AdS_ 7 warped geometries arise naturally from M theory with stacks of M 5 branes. We compactify two spatial dimensions of AdS_ 7 to get AdS_ 5 X Sigma^ 2, where the metric for Sigma^ 2 inherits the same warp factor as appears in the AdS_ 5. We analyze the 5 d spectrum in detail for {{the case of a}} bulk scalar or a graviton in AdS_ 5 X T^ 2, in a setup which mimics the first Randall-Sundrum model. The results display novel features which might be observed in experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. For example, we obtain TeV scale string winding states without lowering the string scale. This is due to the <b>double</b> <b>warping</b> which is a generic feature of winding states along compactified AdS directions. Experimental verification of these signatures of AdS_ 7 could be interpreted as direct evidence for M theory. Comment: 18 pages, 1 figure, version published in PRL (title changed in journal...|$|R
40|$|This work {{seeks to}} {{consider}} the contribution that Ikat weaving and warp printing could make to contemporary textile design. To do this the research first considered the historical background to Ikat weaving and warp printing by examining'the visual and structural characteristics involved and the definitions used historically. Then by studying in some detail the methods of manufacture, dyestuffs, and design imagery of warp Ikats from South America and Central Asia, and weft and double Ikats from Indonesia and Japan a particular was made with a detailed study comparison of these Ikat techniques in The first volume of this work concluded with a detailed study of warp, weft and double Ikats in Japan. From this historic basis {{and analysis of the}} various techniques used experiments were devised to understand more clearly the effect of fibre, structure, colouration, warp design and its positioning on the image produced in the fabric. In investigating this a series of practical experiments was carried out on warp printed wool, cotton and silk fabrics and measurements made {{of the effects of the}} variables. These results were used to undertake a second series of experiments using slub weft yarns, warp printed silk and warp printed cotton fabrics made from a <b>double</b> <b>warp.</b> The work established from an historical viewpoint that the Ikat weavers were familiar and well practised within the traditional design limits of their craft but that these limits were differently defined for the various types of Ikat produced throughout the world. From the technological experiments the factors controlling the image, its size, position. and effect were determined so that ultimately exemplar design effects were created which suggested ways in which this technique could be developed in the future...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} of two {{companion}} papers in which a thorough study of the normal form and the first integrability conditions arising from bi-conformal vector fields is presented. These new symmetry transformations were introduced in Class. Quantum Grav. 21, 2153 - 2177 and some of their basic properties were addressed there. In our calculations a new affine connection (bi-conformal connection) arises quite naturally and this connection enables us to find a local characterization of conformally separable pseudo-Riemannian manifolds (also called double twisted products) in terms of the vanishing of a rank three tensor T_abc. Similar local characterizations are found for the most important particular cases such as (<b>double)</b> <b>warped</b> products, twisted products and conformally reducible spaces (this classification will be enlarged in the forthcoming second paper). We speculate with potential applications of the bi-conformal connection to the invariant characterization of other types of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds in which the metric tensor has a part conformal to a metric of lesser rank.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the same}} sense that AdS 5 warped {{geometries}} arise naturally from Type IIB string theory with stacks of D 3 branes, AdS 7 warped geometries arise naturally from M theory with stacks of M 5 branes. We compactify two spatial dimensions of AdS 7 to get AdS 5 × Σ 2, where Σ 2 is e. g. a torus T 2 or a sphere S 2. The metric for Σ inherits the same warp factor as appears in the AdS 5. Bulk fields generically have both Kaluza-Klein and winding modes associated with Σ. In the effective 5 d action these will contribute exotic new excitations. We analyze the 5 d spectrum in detail for {{the case of a}} bulk scalar or a graviton in AdS 5 × T 2, in a setup which mimics the first Randall-Sundrum model. The results display several novel features, some of which might be observed in experiments at the LHC. For example, we obtain TeV scale string winding states without lowering the string scale.

5000|$|Doubling of yarn {{where two}} or more stands or ends of yarn are twisted together. There are many {{purposes}} where doubled yarn is used. Sometimes thread is <b>doubled</b> to make <b>warp,</b> and it is invariably used for the manufacture of knitting yarn, crochet yarn and sewing yarn. All these yarns must be smooth and free from knots. In a sewing thread, the treads are doubled in two phases. Two or three strands are twisted together then three of theses threads are twisted together, to form a six or nine cord.The spun yarn is wound onto a bobbin using a doubling winding machine, and {{two or more}} of these bobbins are placed on doubling frame (doubling winding machine). The ends pass through a series of rollers and twisted together onto one bobbin using a spindle and flyer. The process here is similar to that found in one of Arkwrights Water frames, though the size of the ring, spindle and traveller are predictably larger. Alternatively a 'twiner' is used: this is a modified spinning mule and is mainly consigned to the <b>doubling</b> of <b>warp</b> thread High quality doubling depended on keeping the tension correct and feeding the produced thread evenly and tightly on a bobbin or flangeless paper tubes ...|$|R
5000|$|Kazak {{according}} to Latimov {{refers to a}} district and its center town located between {{the borders of the}} Azerbaijan Republic towards the northwest into the Republic of Georgia and towards the southwest into the Republic of Armenia. The city of Kasak lies 460 km west of Baku. The warp of Kazak rugs is of sheep wool, not dyed, rather dark ivory, sometimes camel hair is said to be used. The weft is of wool, or a blend of wool and camel hair. Sometimes wool and cotton threads are only slightly plied together to form the warp thread. Wefts are dyed mostly in light red, wefts in dark blue distinguish the Kazak from Karabakh rugs. 2-6 wefts are shot in after each row of knots. The pile is wool, sometimes undyed camel hair, the knots being symmetrical, the warps not depressed. Kazak rugs are woven more coarsely, their pile being 1-2 cm high. The upper end is fastened with a 1-4 cm wide woolen tapestry weave in red colours. The lower end is often finished like the upper end, but uncut warp loops are often seen protruding from the flat-woven end. Selvedges are nearly always flat nd between 1-2 cm wide, consisting of two ribs in figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads, these often in different colours. In most cases, two <b>double</b> <b>warps</b> are wrapped three times. Kazak rugs have a limited colour palette of 5-7 colours. In general, the field has a red background, less frequently also ivory, green, blue, or yellow, the colour of the main border often in contrasting colours. The colour of the main borders is often difficult to identify due to the dense ornamentation. Kazak rugs woven before ca. 1910 have more intense and bright colours than rugs woven after this year.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} to develop a new {{structure}} of <b>double</b> jersey <b>warp</b> knitted fabric with effective water absorption and transport property which contributes to comfortable wear condition. Objective measurements in terms of vertical wicking, wetting time, air resistance, water vapor permeability as well as fabric handle were utilized to evaluate the comfort property of fabrics. This study demonstrated that the fabric knitted in plant structure had faster initial water transport rate, faster water absorbency speed, quicker vertical wicking rate, lower air resistance and better handle than the conventional control fabric. Furthermore, sweating manikin test suggests that polo-shirt made with plant structured fabric had lower evaporative resistance and thermal resistance against conventional warp knitted garment under 2. 2 m/s wind speed. Besides, wear trial was performed in hot and normal office condition. The subjective test result suggested that plant structured garment is more comfortable than the conventional garment in terms of skin temperature and humidity under sitting and walking.

5000|$|Doubling is {{a textile}} {{industry}} term synonymous with combining. It {{can be used}} for various processes during spinning. During the carding stage, several sources of roving are doubled together and drawn, to remove variations in thickness. After spinning, yarn is doubled for many reasons. Yarn may be <b>doubled</b> to produce <b>warp</b> for weaving, to make cotton for lace, crochet and knitting. [...] It is used for embroidery threads and sewing threads, for example: sewing thread is usually 6-cable thread. Two threads of spun 60s cotton are twisted together, and three of these double threads are twisted into a cable, of what is now 5s yarn. This is mercerised, gassed (AKA flamed) and wound onto a bobbin.|$|R

40|$|As a {{complement}} to shortfibre reinforced air-placed concrete, textile reinforced concrete elements present new {{applications in the}} area of thin-walled elements, due to their high strength resitance. By physical and chemical examinations fibermaterial is detected, which on principle is suitable for the reinforcement of concrete elements. For an optimum exploitation of the strength of reinforcement fibres, like Carbon-, alkaline resistant Glass- and Basaltfibers, it is necessary to develop processes, which enable of manufacture load-controlled reinforcement textiles. On principle manufacturing methods for planar textiles, like special lenofabrics and lattice-like multiaxial-multiply-fabrics are developed. For the production of threedimensional reinforcement textiles, a <b>double</b> wall <b>warp</b> knittting machine and a circular warp knitting machine are presented. Since the fiber effectivity of a reinforcement textile only can partially be utilized, the bonding behaviour to the cementious matrics is tested in dependance on the following parameters: Thread distance, Cross section geometry of rovings, Coating material and Sizing. All textile structures are described with one function of the program MATLAB. These structural modellings can be taken as a foundation of a FE-simulation. According to three examples of different applications, the economic efficiency of the manufacturing process of shortfiber reinforced air-placed concrete is compared to a textile reinforced alternative. In these cases the economic efficiency can be assessed separately for small-lot production and industrial scale manufacturing...|$|R

SMXs {{are the reason}} for Kepler's power efficiency as the whole GPU uses a single unified clock speed. Although SMXs usage of a single unified clock increases power efficiency {{due to the fact}} that multiple lower clock Kepler CUDA Cores consume 90% less power than multiple higher clock Fermi CUDA Core, additional processing units are needed to execute a whole <b>warp</b> per cycle. <b>Doubling</b> 16 to 32 per CUDA array solve the warp execution problem, the SMX front-end are also <b>double</b> with <b>warp</b> schedulers, dispatch unit and the register file doubled to 64K entries as to feed the additional execution units. With the risk of inflating die area, SMX PolyMorph Engines are enhanced to 2.0 rather than double alongside the execution units, enabling it to spurr polygon in shorter cycles. Dedicated FP64 CUDA cores are also used as all Kepler CUDA cores are not FP64 capable to save die space. With the improvement Nvidia made on the SMX, the results include an increase in GPU performance and efficiency. With GK110, the 48KB texture cache are unlocked for compute workloads. In compute workload the texture cache becomes a read-only data cache, specializing in unaligned memory access workloads. Furthermore, error detection capabilities have been added to make it safer for workloads that rely on ECC. The register per thread count is also doubled in GK110 with 255 registers per thread.|$|R
5000|$|The Kepler {{architecture}} {{employs a}} new Streaming Multiprocessor Architecture called SMX. The SMX {{are the key}} method for Kepler's power efficiency as the whole GPU uses a single [...] "Core Clock" [...] rather than the double-pump [...] "Shader Clock". The SMX usage of a single unified clock increases the GPU power efficiency {{due to the fact}} that two Kepler CUDA Cores consume 90% power of one Fermi CUDA Core. Consequently, the SMX needs additional processing units to execute a whole warp per cycle. Kepler also needed to increase raw GPU performance as to remain competitive. As a result, it doubled the CUDA Cores from 16 to 32 per CUDA array, 3 CUDA Cores Array to 6 CUDA Cores Array, 1 load/store and 1 SFU group to 2 load/store and 2 SFU group. The GPU processing resources are also <b>double.</b> From 2 <b>warp</b> schedulers to 4 warp schedulers, 4 dispatch unit became 8 and the register file doubled to 64K entries as to increase performance. With the doubling of GPU processing units and resources increasing the usage of die spaces, The capability of the PolyMorph Engine aren't double but enhanced, making it capable of spurring out a polygon in 2 cycles instead of 4. With Kepler, Nvidia not only worked on power efficiency but also on area efficiency. Therefore, Nvidia opted to use eight dedicated FP64 CUDA cores in a SMX as to save die space, while still offering FP64 capabilities since all Kepler CUDA cores are not FP64 capable. With the improvement Nvidia made on Kepler, the results include an increase in GPU graphic performance while downplaying FP64 performance.|$|R
