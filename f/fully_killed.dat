40|$|The dynamic {{strain aging}} (DSA) {{phenomenon}} {{is present in}} C–Mn steels and associated welds commonly used in many industrial applications. This phenomenon, which appears in metals containing solute atoms interacting with dislocations, induces an increase in flow stress and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) {{as well as a}} decrease in ductility. The DSA phenomenon was studied by tensile, strain rate sensitivity and internal friction tests between 20 uC and 350 uC in two C–Mn steels with very different sensitivities to DSA (a <b>fully</b> <b>killed</b> A 42 steel and a semikilled A 48 steel). The internal friction technique, which allows one to evaluate the balance between carbon and nitrogen atoms free in the lattice and carbon and nitrogen atoms interacting with mobile dislocations, appears to give results well correlated with those obtained by tensile (and strain rate sensitivity) tests. The ductility loss or the UTS increase is shown to be proportional to Snoek peak height. It is concluded that, even in industrial materials, a single internal friction test can give a good evaluation of DSA sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Structures {{representative}} of the visible weld heat-affected zone (HAZ) of a serai-killed C- Mn steel and a <b>fully</b> <b>killed</b> and normalised aluminium grain-refined C- Mn steel have been produced {{by means of a}} simulation technique. The Charpy V- notch imipact properties have been assessed and related to microstructure. The only significant deterioration in impact properties occurred in the coarse grained HAZ of the aluminium grain-refined steel. The notch- impact properties of the subcrltical weld HAZ have been assessed by simulating specimen blanks with and without notches through thermal cycles reported to cause the greatest degree of subcritical embrittlement in these steels. The results showed that no significant embrittlement occurred in either steel in the absence of notches. In the presence of a notch there was evidence of an increase in transition temperature of 10 35 C in the semi-killed steel but no increase in the aluminium grain-refined steel. The slight increase for the semi-killed steel was attributed to the presence of free nitrogen, which was absent in the aluminium grain- refined steel...|$|E
40|$|Crossed Andreev {{reflection}} (CAR) {{is considered}} to probe the non-locality of the Majorana quasiparticles in topological superconductors. We propose here to study the CAR in multiband one-dimensional (1 D) topological superconductors {{which may or may}} not have chiral symmetries, and show how the CAR can be applied to identify Majorana modes in such systems. In particular, for a multiband 1 D topological superconductor with approximate chiral symmetry, both the multiple Majorana and low-energy Andreev bound modes can drive the nearly zero-bias CAR, which is shown to be protected by the chiral symmetry and is stable against non-magnetic disorder scatterings. The emergence of symmetry protected CAR makes it hard to identify exotic Majorana fermions out of low-energy Andreev bound states. It is interesting that the magnetic disorders, which break chiral symmetry, can <b>fully</b> <b>kill</b> the non-locality of low-energy Andreev bound states, while cannot affect the Majorana modes, leading to the topologically protected CAR which is solely contributed by the Marjorana modes. The experimentally relevant systems, including the semiconductor nanowires and the Fe chains in the top of an $s$-wave superconductor, have been considered. Comment: 8 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|Several {{microbial}} species {{associated with}} wine were challenged against increasing concentrations of dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC). The concentration inducing complete cell death upon addition to red wine {{was regarded as}} the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In dry red wines with 12 % (v/v) ethanol and pH 3. 50, the inactivation depended on the initial cell concentration. For an initial inoculum of 500 CFU/ml, the MIC of the yeasts species Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Dekkera bruxellensis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia guilliermondii was 100 mg/l. The most sensitive strains belong to Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Zygoascus hellenicus and Lachancea thermotolerans, with MIC of 25 mg/l DMDC. For inoculation rates of about 106 CFU/ml, the maximum dose of DMDC legally authorised (200 mg/l) was not effective against the most resistant species. The addition of 100 mg/l potassium metabisulphite (PMB), equivalent to 1 mg/l molecular sulphur dioxide, increased the inactivation effect of 100 mg/l DMDC over initial yeast populations of 106 CFU/ml but did not <b>fully</b> <b>kill</b> S. pombe and S. cerevisiae. Lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria were not killed {{by the addition of}} 300 mg/l of DMDC. Trials performed in wines before bottling showed that in most samples indigenous bacterial populations were not affected by 200 mg/l DMDC. Therefore, under winery practice, DMDC at the maximum dose legally permitted may be regarded as an efficient preservative to control low contamination rates of yeasts but ineffective against lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (Mfs) {{infected}} with virulent strains of Mycobacterium avium (TMC 724 and a human clinical isolate) or with an avirulent opaque variant that spontaneously dissociates from the virulent human clinical isolate {{were subjected to}} a prolonged and continuous treatment with clarithromycin added at the MIC. The efficiency of this antibiotic in terms of inhibition of bacterial growth and bacterial degradation was evaluated during a 21 -day treatment period. Growth was assessed by determination of CFU of intracellular bacteria and by a quantitative ultrastructural analysis which allowed us also {{to determine the extent}} of bacterial degradation. A similar treatment was applied to the same strains growing in liquid medium. Our data show that in liquid medium, clarithromycin caused a 90 % decrease in CFU within 7 days of treatment. When applied to Mfs {{infected with}} virulent M. avium, clarithromycin immediately arrested bacterial growth but was unable to <b>fully</b> <b>kill</b> and degrade intracellularly growing virulent bacteria. After 21 days of treatment, 25 % of intracellular bacteria were still morphologically intact. These bacteria resumed growth upon removal of the antibiotic, with a normal replication rate. These bacteria had not become more resistant to the drug, since the MIC was unchanged as compared to the one determined for the initial stock used to infect Mfs. Our data therefore suggest that the intraphagosomal environment protects bacteria from degradation. We propose that the inability of the drug to completely destroy bacteria is the result of a limited accessibilit...|$|R

With her influence, she used the Chief Steward to give Xiaoyu and Wuji a recommendation letter in order to join the Bu'er Manor. Her efforts to win Xiaoyu's heart failed as Xiaoyu rejected her and treated her only as a friend. Heartbroken, Shuangshuang confided her despair on Wuji and began a friendly relationship. In an episode, Wuji accidentally landed on Shuangshuang while she was taking a bath, leaving a handkerchief with Xiayou's name embroidered on it. She believed that the culprit was Xiaoyu and not Wuji. Their friendship {{came to an end}} because of a false accusation regarding Yuwen Pu's death. Shuangshuang was determined to execute Wuji to the point she sold herself as a bride to any man who could destroy Wuji. Afterwards, Xiaoyu placed them in an agreement since he was always caught in the middle. The contract was that Wuji would pass on his skills to Shuangshuang and they are to fight on the first and fifteenth day of every month in a year.

50|$|The poison headcrab (also {{known as}} the black headcrab or venomous headcrab) is {{slightly}} larger than its counterparts with dark sage-green-colored skin and thick hairs on the joints of its body and inward-bending legs. To distinguish it further, it has white bands that encircle its knee joints, wider legs, and a more flattened body, giving it a generally more crab-like appearance. It also makes a chirp at range and a hissing-rattling {{similar to that of}} a rattlesnake's tail when it detects a viable host. Immediately before pouncing, they emit a loud, distinctive shriek. There is also a whipping noise as they pounce. Unlike the other headcrabs, the poisonous headcrab has some survival instinct, as it will retreat when injured. Although it is the slowest-moving version of the headcrab when calm, it can outpace an ordinary headcrab when retreating. Another difference is that the poison headcrab takes a longer time to burn to death than the other types. Poison headcrabs get their name from the neurotoxin they carry, which reduces the player's health to one point instantly on contact, meaning that minimal additional damage can easily kill the player. Gordon's HEV suit provides an antidote that will restore the missing health over a short period, minus the damage caused by the attack itself. While this makes a single poisonous headcrab unable to <b>fully</b> <b>kill</b> Gordon, it can make survival much more problematic if other enemies are present. Half-Life 2: Raising The Bar notes that play-testers would prioritize poison headcrabs as targets, regardless of any other present dangers. They will group together on a single host once one is found: the attacking poison headcrab controls the host, while the others use the new host as transportation, having it throw them at new victims. (It is also possible that these additional headcrabs are produced by the host human, as a method of reproduction {{on the part of the}} primary headcrab).|$|R

Before {{the events of}} the games, Hale had been involved in an accident during a live fire exercise that led to serious injury to himself. The accident was blamed on faulty munitions. After being rehabilitated both physically and mentally, Hale returned to active duty. His commanding officers often granted him high-risk missions because of his excellence as a soldier, but concerns were constantly raised about his psychological well-being. Hale volunteered along with Jordan Shepard (who later became Daedalus) in a military project, known as Project Abraham. Outwardly the project was supposed to be experiments to find a cure for the European Influenza epidemic, but it was really testing a vaccine against the Chimeran virus.

While away, Sharon became depressed and on the verge of suicide. During her absence, Cassie nearly dies after falling into an icy pond, and resented Sharon upon her return. Sharon was confronted with her past when a man who she had sex with and who later abused her while she was out of town, Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby), came to town with intent of sleeping with her; as well as Cassie's biological father Frank arriving in town. He attacks her on New Year's Eve and she throws a bottle at him; Sharon believes that she murdered Cameron. However, {{he turned out to be}} alive; Cameron killed Frank and used his dead body to make Sharon believe it was his corpse. Case praised the storyline as one of her favorite, feeling that Sharon was still a hero; stating: [...] "Your romantic lead shouldn't just be a simple romantic lead. Sharon was that for a long time. She was in this love story with Nick and nothing really happened to her. You can only carry that so far." [...] Sharon and Nick was finally solid in their marriage again, after two years of tumultuous events.|$|R
40|$|The broad {{antibacterial}} {{spectrum and}} the low incidence of seizures in meropenem-treated patients qualifies meropenem for therapy of bacterial meningitis. The present study evaluates concentrations in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{in the absence of}} pronounced meningeal inflammation. Patients with occlusive hydrocephalus caused by cerebrovascular diseases, who had undergone external ventriculostomy (n = 10, age range 48 to 75 years), received 2 g of meropenem intravenously over 30 min. Serum and CSF were drawn repeatedly and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Pharmacokinetics were determined by noncompartmental analysis. Maximum concentrations in serum were 84. 7 ± 23. 7 μg/ml. A CSF maximum (CmaxCSF) of 0. 63 ± 0. 50 μg/ml (mean ± standard deviation) was observed 4. 1 ± 2. 6 h {{after the end of the}} infusion. CmaxCSF and the area under the curve for CSF (AUCCSF) depended on the AUC for serum (AUCS), the CSF-to-serum albumin ratio, and the CSF leukocyte count. Elimination from CSF was considerably slower than from serum (half-life at β phase [t 1 / 2 β] of 7. 36 ± 2. 89 h in CSF versus t 1 / 2 β of 1. 69 ± 0. 60 h in serum). The AUCCSF/AUCS ratio for meropenem, as a measure of overall CSF penetration, was 0. 047 ± 0. 022. The AUCCSF/AUCS ratio for meropenem was similar to that for other β-lactam antibiotics with a low binding to serum proteins. The concentration maxima of meropenem in ventricular CSF observed in this study are high enough to <b>kill</b> <b>fully</b> susceptible pathogens. They may not be sufficient to kill bacteria with a reduced sensitivity to carbapenems, although clinical success has been reported for patients with meningitis caused by penicillin-resistant pneumococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa...|$|R
