5|$|Two {{types of}} vaccine are used {{throughout}} the world to combat polio. Both types induce immunity to polio, efficiently blocking person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community (so-called <b>herd</b> <b>immunity).</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Herd</b> <b>immunity,</b> {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E
25|$|<b>Herd</b> <b>immunity</b> is an {{important}} supplement to vaccination. Among those individuals who receive oral polio vaccine, only 95 percent will develop immunity. That means five of every 100 given the vaccine will not develop any immunity and will be susceptible to developing polio. According to the concepts of <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> this population whom the vaccine fails, are still protected by the immunity of those around them. <b>Herd</b> <b>immunity</b> can only be achieved when vaccination levels are high. It is estimated that 80–86 percent of individuals in a population must be immune to polio for the susceptible individuals to be protected by <b>herd</b> <b>immunity.</b> If routine immunization were stopped, the number of unvaccinated, susceptible individuals would soon exceed the capability of <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> to protect them.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{adoption}} of mass and ring vaccination, complexities and challenges to <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> have arisen. Modelling of the spread of infectious disease originally {{made a number of}} assumptions, namely that entire populations are susceptible and well-mixed, which do not exist in reality, so more precise equations have been developed. In recent decades, it has been recognized that the dominant strain of a microorganism in circulation may change due to <b>herd</b> <b>immunity,</b> either because of <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> acting as an evolutionary pressure or because <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> against one strain allowed another already-existing strain to spread. Emerging or ongoing vaccine controversies and various reasons for opposing vaccination have made <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> to either not be established or to disappear in certain communities, allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to these communities.|$|E
25|$|Incomplete vaccine {{coverage}} {{increases the risk}} of disease for the entire population, including those who have been vaccinated, because it reduces <b>herd</b> <b>immunity.</b> For example, the measles vaccine is given to {{children between the ages of}} 9 and 12 months, and the short window between the disappearance of maternal antibody (before which the vaccine often fails to seroconvert) and natural infection means that vaccinated children are frequently still vulnerable. <b>Herd</b> <b>immunity</b> lessens this vulnerability if all the children are vaccinated. Increasing <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> during an outbreak or risk of outbreak is perhaps the most widely accepted justification for mass vaccination. Mass vaccination also helps to increase coverage rapidly, thus obtaining <b>herd</b> <b>immunity,</b> when a new vaccine is introduced.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{immunity}} can {{be gained}} through {{recovering from a}} natural infection or through artificial means such as vaccination. Some individuals cannot become immune due to medical reasons and in this group <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> is an important method of protection. Once a certain threshold has been reached, <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> gradually eliminates a disease from a population. This elimination, if achieved worldwide, may result in the permanent {{reduction in the number}} of infections to zero, called eradication. This method was used for the eradication of smallpox in 1977 and for the regional elimination of other diseases. <b>Herd</b> <b>immunity</b> does not apply to all diseases, just those that are contagious, meaning that they can be transmitted from one individual to another. Tetanus, for example, is infectious but not contagious, so <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> does not apply.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> {{was first}} used in 1923. It was {{recognized}} as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when {{it was observed that}} after a significant number of children had become immune to measles, the number of new infections temporarily decreased, including among susceptible children.* Mass vaccination to induce <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> has since become common and proved successful in preventing the spread of many infectious diseases. Opposition to vaccination has posed a challenge to <b>herd</b> <b>immunity,</b> allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to communities that have inadequate vaccination rates.|$|E
25|$|These sweeps {{were driven}} by <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> and acted to {{constrain}} viral genetic diversity.|$|E
25|$|Universal {{immunisation}} {{producing a}} high level of <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> is important in the control of epidemics of rubella.|$|E
25|$|Low vaccine-preventable disease {{rates as}} a result of <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> also make {{vaccines}} seem unnecessary and leave many unvaccinated.|$|E
25|$|If a {{vaccination}} program successfully reduces the disease threat, it {{may reduce the}} perceived risk of disease as cultural memories {{of the effects of}} that disease fade. At this point, parents may feel they have nothing to lose by not vaccinating their children. If enough people hope to become free-riders, gaining the benefits of <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> without vaccination, vaccination levels may drop to a level where <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> ceases to be as effective.|$|E
25|$|For sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs), {{high levels of}} immunity in one sex induces <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> for both sexes. Vaccines against STIs that are targeted at one sex result in significant declines in sexual disease in both sexes if vaccine uptake in the target sex is high. <b>Herd</b> <b>immunity</b> from female vaccination does not, however, extend to homosexual males. If vaccine uptake among the target sex is low, then the other sex {{may need to be}} immunized so that that sex can be sufficiently protected. High-risk behaviors make eliminating STIs difficult since even though most infections occur among individuals with moderate risk, the majority of transmissions occur because of individuals who engage in high-risk behaviors. For these reasons, certain populations may require immunizing high-risk persons or individuals of both sexes to establish <b>herd</b> <b>immunity.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Herd</b> <b>immunity</b> also {{decreases}} risk {{to people}} who have a compromised immune system. Some people who have a compromised immune system cannot get certain vaccines and thus are at increased risk if those around them are not vaccinated for those diseases. If the immunocompromised person is surrounded by people who have not been vaccinated and have the disease, that person will likely contract the disease. The outcome for people with compromised immune systems who subsequently get infected is often worse than that of the general population. <b>Herd</b> <b>immunity</b> decreases this risk.|$|E
25|$|<b>Herd</b> <b>immunity</b> {{is often}} {{accounted}} for when conducting cost–benefit analyses of vaccination programs. It {{is regarded as}} a positive externality of high levels of immunity, producing an additional benefit of disease reduction that would not occur had no <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> been generated in the population. Therefore, herd immunity's inclusion in cost–benefit analyses results in more favorable cost-effectiveness or cost–benefit ratios and {{an increase in the number}} of disease cases averted by vaccination. Study designs done to estimate herd immunity's benefit include recording disease incidence in households in which a member was vaccinated, randomizing a population in a single geographic area to be vaccinated or not, and observing disease incidence before and after a vaccination program is introduced. From these, it can be observed that disease incidence may decrease to a level beyond what can be predicted from direct protection alone, indicating that <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> contributed to the reduction. When serotype replacement is accounted for, it lessens the predicted benefits of vaccination.|$|E
25|$|If <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> {{has been}} {{established}} and maintained in a population for a sufficient time, the disease is inevitably eliminated—no more endemic transmissions occurs. If elimination is achieved worldwide {{and the number of}} cases is permanently reduced to zero, then a disease can be declared eradicated. Eradication can thus be considered the final effect or end-result of public health initiatives to control the spread of infectious disease. The benefits of eradication include ending all morbidity and mortality caused by the disease, financial savings for individuals, health care providers, and governments, and enabling resources used to control the disease to be used elsewhere. To date, two diseases have been eradicated using <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> and vaccination: rinderpest and smallpox. Eradication efforts that rely on <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> are currently underway for poliomyelitis, though civil unrest and distrust of modern medicine have made this difficult. Voluntary vaccination, for a variety of reasons, may be an obstacle to eradication if not enough people become immune to a disease.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} hypothesis {{about the}} epidemiology—the appearance, spread, and especially disappearance—of plague from Europe {{is that the}} flea-bearing rodent reservoir of disease was eventually succeeded by another species. The Black Rat (Rattus rattus) was originally introduced from Asia to Europe by trade, but was subsequently displaced and succeeded throughout Europe by the bigger Brown Rat (Rattus norvegicus). The brown rat was not as prone to transmit the germ-bearing fleas to humans in large die-offs due to a different rat ecology. The dynamic complexities of rat ecology, <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> in that reservoir, interaction with human ecology, secondary transmission routes between humans with or without fleas, human <b>herd</b> <b>immunity,</b> and changes in each might explain the eruption, dissemination, and re-eruptions of plague that continued for centuries until its unexplained disappearance.|$|E
25|$|Although the American Academy of Pediatrics endorses {{universal}} immunization, {{they note}} that physicians should respect parents’ refusal to vaccinate their children after sufficient advising and provided the child does not face a significant risk of infection. Parents can also cite religious reasons to avoid public school vaccination mandates, but this reduces <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> and increases risk of viral infection.|$|E
25|$|High {{levels of}} {{immunity}} in one age group can create <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> for other age groups. Vaccinating adults against pertussis reduces pertussis incidence in infants {{too young to}} be vaccinated, who are at the greatest risk of complications from the disease. This is especially important for close family members, who account for most of the transmissions to young infants. In the same manner, children receiving vaccines against pneumococcus reduces pneumococcal disease incidence among younger, unvaccinated siblings. Conversely, vaccinating children against pneumococcus and rotavirus has had the effect of reducing pneumococcus- and rotavirus-attributable hospitalizations for older children and adults, who do not normally receive these vaccines. Influenza (flu) is more severe in the elderly than in younger age groups, but influenza vaccines lack effectiveness in this demographic due to a waning of the immune system with age. The prioritization of school-age children for seasonal flu immunization, which is more effective than vaccinating the elderly, however, has shown to create a certain degree of <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> for the elderly.|$|E
25|$|Polio {{vaccination}} is {{also important}} {{in the development of}} <b>herd</b> <b>immunity.</b> For polio to occur in a population, there needs to be an infecting organism (poliovirus), a susceptible human population, and a cycle of transmission. Poliovirus is transmitted only through person-to-person contact and the transmission cycle of polio is from one infected person to another person susceptible to the disease, and so on. If {{the vast majority of the}} population is immune to a particular agent, the ability of that pathogen to infect another host is reduced; the cycle of transmission is interrupted, and the pathogen cannot reproduce and dies out. This concept, called community immunity or <b>herd</b> <b>immunity,</b> is important to disease eradication, because it means that it is not necessary to inoculate 100% of the population—a goal that is often logistically very difficult—to achieve the desired result. If the number of susceptible individuals can be reduced to a sufficiently small number through vaccination, then the pathogen will eventually die off.|$|E
25|$|Some {{individuals}} {{depend on}} <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> because they either cannot develop immunity or for medical reasons cannot be vaccinated. Newborn infants {{are too young}} to receive many vaccines, either for safety reasons or because passive immunity renders the vaccine ineffective. Individuals who possess an immunodeficiency from HIV/AIDS, lymphoma, leukemia, a bone marrow cancer, an impaired spleen, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy may have lost any immunity that they previously had and vaccines may not be of any use for them because of their immunodeficiency. Vaccines are typically imperfect as some individuals' immune systems may not generate an adequate immune response to vaccines to confer long-term immunity, so a portion of those who are vaccinated may lack immunity. Lastly, vaccine contraindications for specific populations may prevent individuals in these populations from becoming immune. Individuals in one of these groups may be at a greater risk of developing complications from infection because of their medical status, so they generally rely on <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> more than others who can otherwise safely become immune via vaccination.|$|E
25|$|While most antivirals treat viral infection, {{vaccines}} are {{a preemptive}} {{first line of}} defense against pathogens. Vaccination involves the introduction (i.e. via injection) of a small amount of typically inactivated or attenuated antigenic material to stimulate an individual’s immune system. The immune system responds by developing white blood cells to specifically combat the introduced pathogen, resulting in adaptive immunity. Vaccination in a population results in <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> and greatly improved population health, with significant reductions in viral infection and disease.|$|E
25|$|The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) was {{established}} by the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), passed by the United States Congress {{in response to a}} threat to the vaccine supply due to a 1980s scare over the DPT vaccine. Despite the belief of most public health officials that claims of side effects were unfounded, large jury awards had been given to some plaintiffs, most DPT vaccine makers had ceased production, and officials feared the loss of <b>herd</b> <b>immunity.</b>|$|E
25|$|In November 2011, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) {{recommended}} {{the extension of}} the National HPV Vaccination Program to include males. The PBAC made its recommendation on the preventative health benefits that can be achieved, such as a reduction in the incidence of anal and penile cancers and other HPV-related diseases. In addition to the direct benefit to males, it was estimated that routine HPV vaccination of adolescent males would contribute to the reduction of vaccine HPV-type infection and associated disease in women through <b>herd</b> <b>immunity.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{injectable}} vaccine {{was found}} to be effective for two to three years. The protective efficacy was 28% lower in children less than 5 years old. However, as of 2010, it has limited availability. Work is under way to investigate the role of mass vaccination. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends immunization of high-risk groups, such as children and people with HIV, in countries where this disease is endemic. If people are immunized broadly, <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> results, with a decrease in the amount of contamination in the environment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Herd</b> <b>immunity</b> (also called herd effect, {{community}} immunity, population immunity, {{or social}} immunity) {{is a form}} of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, thereby providing a measure of protection for individuals who are not immune. In a population in which a large number of individuals are immune, chains of infection are likely to be disrupted, which stops or slows the spread of disease. The greater the proportion of individuals in a community who are immune, the smaller the probability that those who are not immune will come into contact with an infectious individual.|$|E
25|$|Vaccines {{have contributed}} to the {{eradication}} of smallpox, one of the most contagious and deadly diseases in humans. Other diseases such as rubella, polio, measles, mumps, chickenpox, and typhoid are nowhere near as common as they were a hundred years ago. As long as {{the vast majority of people}} are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. This effect is called <b>herd</b> <b>immunity.</b> Polio, which is transmitted only between humans, is targeted by an extensive eradication campaign that has seen endemic polio restricted to only parts of three countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan). However, the difficulty of reaching all children as well as cultural misunderstandings have caused the anticipated eradication date to be missed several times.|$|E
25|$|H5N1 {{may cause}} {{more than one}} {{influenza}} pandemic, as {{it is expected to}} continue mutating in birds regardless of whether humans develop <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> to a future pandemic strain. Influenza pandemics from its genetic offspring may include influenza A virus subtypes other than H5N1. While genetic analysis of the H5N1 virus shows that influenza pandemics from its genetic offspring can easily be far more lethal than the Spanish flu pandemic, planning for a future influenza pandemic is based on what can be done and there is no higher Pandemic Severity Index level than a Category 5 pandemic which, roughly speaking, is any pandemic as bad as the Spanish flu or worse; and for which all intervention measures are to be used.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{observed}} from this equation that, ceteris paribus, any increase in either vaccine coverage or vaccine effectiveness, including any increase in excess of a disease's HIT, further reduces {{the number of cases}} of a disease. The rate of decline in cases depends on a disease's R0, with diseases with lower R0 values experiencing sharper declines. Vaccines usually possess at least one contraindication for a specific population for medical reasons, so it is vital for both effectiveness and coverage to be high so that <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> can be established to protect these individuals. Vaccine effectiveness is often, but not always, adversely affected by passive immunity, so additional doses are recommended for some vaccines while others are not administered until after an individual has lost his or her passive immunity.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{immunity}} {{can also}} be gained passively, in which antibodies to a pathogen are transferred from one individual to another. This can occur naturally, whereby maternal antibodies, primarily immunoglobulin G antibodies, are transferred across the placenta and in colostrum to fetuses and newborns, or artificially, by which antibodies from the serum or plasma of an immune individual are injected into a susceptible person. Protection generated from passive immunity is immediate but wanes {{over the course of}} weeks to months, so any contribution to <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> is temporary. For diseases that are especially severe among fetuses and newborns, such as influenza and tetanus, pregnant women may be immunized in order to transfer antibodies to the child. In the same way, high-risk groups that are either more likely to experience infection or are more likely to develop complications from infection may receive antibody preparations to prevent these infections or to reduce the severity of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The primary way {{to boost}} levels of {{immunity}} {{in a population}} is through vaccination. Their use is originally based on the observation that milkmaids exposed to cowpox were immune to smallpox, so the practice of inoculating people with the cowpox virus began {{as a way to}} prevent smallpox cases. Well-developed vaccines provide protection in a far safer way than natural infections, as vaccines generally do not cause the diseases they protect against and severe adverse effects are significantly less common than complications from natural infections. The immune system does not distinguish between natural infections and vaccines, forming an active response to both, so immunity induced via vaccination is similar to what would have occurred from contracting and recovering from the disease. To achieve <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> through vaccination, vaccine manufacturers aim to produce vaccines with low failure rates and policy makers aim to encourage their use. After the successful introduction and widespread use of a vaccine, sharp declines in the incidence of diseases it protects against can be observed, necessarily decreasing the number of hospitalizations and deaths caused by such diseases.|$|E
25|$|Opposition to vaccination, from a {{wide array}} of vaccine critics, has existed since the {{earliest}} vaccination campaigns. Although the benefits of preventing serious illness and death from infectious diseases greatly outweigh the risks of rare serious adverse effects following immunization, disputes have arisen over the morality, ethics, effectiveness, and safety of vaccination. Some vaccination critics say that vaccines are ineffective against disease or that vaccine safety studies are inadequate. Some religious groups do not allow vaccination, and some political groups oppose mandatory vaccination on the grounds of individual liberty. In response, concern has been raised that spreading unfounded information about the medical risks of vaccines increases rates of life-threatening infections, not only in the children whose parents refused vaccinations, but also in those who cannot be vaccinated due to age or immunodeficiency, who could contract infections from unvaccinated carriers (see <b>herd</b> <b>immunity).</b> Some parents believe vaccinations cause autism, although there is no scientific evidence to support this idea. In 2011, Andrew Wakefield, a leading proponent of one of the main controversies regarding a purported link between autism and vaccines, was found to have been financially motivated to falsify research data and was subsequently stripped of his medical license. In the United States people who refuse vaccines for non-medical reasons have made up {{a large percentage of the}} cases of measles, and subsequent cases of permanent hearing loss and death caused by the disease.|$|E
500|$|Bell {{has also}} become a strong {{advocate}} of vaccination. Though initially skeptical she has since stated [...] "I think it's really important to acknowledge that we have something called the <b>herd</b> <b>immunity,</b> where {{there are people that}} cannot get immunizations because of autoimmune diseases or cancer treatments," [...] and that [...] "If we don't get the vaccinations to keep them safe, then they're screwed." [...] Citing scientific research, she shares her belief that it is her duty to not only protect her children, but other children, too—especially those who may suffer from autoimmune diseases or cancer.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Herd</b> <b>immunity</b> itself {{acts as an}} {{evolutionary}} pressure on certain viruses, influencing viral evolution by encouraging the production of novel strains, in this case referred to as escape mutants, {{that are able to}} [...] "escape" [...] from <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> and spread more easily. At the molecular level, viruses escape from <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> through antigenic drift, which is when mutations accumulate in the portion of the viral genome that encodes for the virus's surface antigen, typically a protein of the virus capsid, producing a change in the viral epitope. Alternatively, the reassortment of separate viral genome segments, or antigenic shift, which is more common when there are more strains in circulation, can also produce new serotypes. When either of these occur, memory T cells no longer recognize the virus, so <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> ceases to be relevant to the dominant circulating strain. For both influenza and norovirus, epidemics temporarily induce <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> until a new dominant strain emerges, causing successive waves of epidemics. As this evolution poses a challenge to <b>herd</b> <b>immunity,</b> broadly neutralizing antibodies and [...] "universal" [...] vaccines that can provide protection beyond a specific serotype are in development.|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> {{was first}} used in 1923 to refer to an entire population's immunity, in {{reference}} to research examining disease mortality in mouse populations {{with varying degrees of}} immunity. <b>Herd</b> <b>immunity</b> was first recognized as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when A. W. Hedrich published research on the epidemiology of measles in Baltimore and took notice that after many children had become immune to measles, the number of new infections temporarily decreased, including among susceptible children. In spite of this knowledge, efforts to control and eliminate measles were unsuccessful until mass vaccination using the measles vaccine began in the 1960s. Mass vaccination, discussions of disease eradication, and cost–benefit analyses of vaccination subsequently prompted more widespread use of the term <b>herd</b> <b>immunity.</b> In the 1970s, the theorem used to calculated a disease's <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> threshold was developed. During the smallpox eradication campaign in the 1960s and 1970s, the practice of ring vaccination, of which <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> is integral to, began as a way to immunize every person in a [...] "ring" [...] around an infected individual to prevent outbreaks from spreading.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Herd</b> <b>immunity</b> is {{vulnerable}} to the free rider problem. [...] Individuals who lack immunity, primarily those who choose not to vaccinate, free ride off the <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> created {{by those who are}} immune. [...] As the number of free riders in a population increases, outbreaks of preventable diseases become more common and more severe. Individuals may choose to free ride for a variety of reasons, including bandwagoning or groupthinking, social norms or peer pressure, religious beliefs, the perceived effectiveness of a vaccine, mistrust of vaccines or public health officials, and believing that the risks associated with vaccines are greater than those associated with infection. Individuals are more likely to free ride if vaccination rates are high enough so as to convince a person that he or she may not need to be immune since a sufficient number of others already are. If large numbers of people in a community free ride, <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> in that community is lost.|$|E
2500|$|From this equation, {{it can be}} {{observed}} that if E is less than (1 − 1/R0), then {{it is impossible to}} eliminate a disease, even if the entire population is vaccinated. Similarly, waning vaccine-induced immunity, as occurs with acellular pertussis vaccines, requires higher levels of booster vaccination to sustain <b>herd</b> <b>immunity.</b> If a disease has ceased to be endemic to a population, then natural infections no longer contribute to a reduction in the fraction of the population that is susceptible. Only vaccination contribute to this reduction. The relation between vaccine coverage and effectiveness and disease incidence can be shown by subtracting the product of the effectiveness of a vaccine and the proportion of the population that is vaccinated, pv, from the <b>herd</b> <b>immunity</b> threshold equation as follows: ...|$|E
