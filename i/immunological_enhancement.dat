40|$|Prolonged {{survival}} of vascularized organ allografts has been produced in unmodified inbred rats by transfer of thymocytes from enhanced, engrafted, syngeneic animals. For these thymocytes to increase significantly the {{survival of}} test allografts they must be harvested 6 - 9 d after transplantation. Thymectomy of the enhanced, engrafted animals during the same critical period causes acute rejection of othewise long surviving grafts. For optimal effect, the enhanced thymocyte donor must be actively and passively immunized and receive a cardiac allograft. The necessity for erythrocytes in the initial active immunization regimen is noted. Additionally, the antigenic specificity of the suppressor effect has been established with two histoincompatible donor rat strains. Cellular and humoral host responses mounted by test graft recipients after thymocyte transfer from enhanced, engrafted donors {{are different from those}} mounted either by unmodifed animals acutely rejecting their grafts or by enhanced rats bearing well-functioning grafts. Numbers of T lymphocytes are reduced in the grafted hearts and in the spleens of test graft recipients, a finding paralleled by the complete absence of specific direct lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. In contrast, cytotoxic antibody production, although delayed, is increased in magnitude, peaking around the time of graft rejection. These studies provide evidence that different biological manipulations can modify separate pathways in the complex cellular and humoral responses towards organ allografts. They demonstrate that cellular immunity is critically involved in <b>immunological</b> <b>enhancement</b> of vascularized organ allografts, a phenomenon hitherto considered primarily humoral.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of immune deviation (1), also termed split tolerance (2) or contrasensitization (3), {{seems to be}} of crucial importance in {{trying to understand the}} relations between the two phenomena of <b>immunological</b> facilitation (<b>enhancement)</b> and <b>immunological</b> tolerance (4). Its mechanism is possibly due to a selective immunodepressive action of various imrnunoglobulin classes of antibodies on active antibody production of various classes. The preceding article has indeed shown the differential effect of passive IgG 1 and IgG 2 antihapten antibodies on the antibody production of these two classes, the main finding being the delayed enhancing effect of passive IgG 1 on their own production. 1 On the other hand, hapten-carrier relationships have been reported in several immunological systems and, more recently, interpreted within the frame of T cell-B cell cooperation (reviewed in 5). Immunization of the guinea pig with a highly hapten-substituted carrier protein leads to antibody production against the hapten and delayed hypersensitivity to the carrier moiety (6). It has therefore been thought of interest to look for the possible effects of passive IgG 1 and IgG 2 anticarrier antibodies on the active IgG 1 and IgG 2 antihapten response. The present experiments carried along with the precedingly reported ones 1 deal mainly with these effects. As it will be seen, the observed results are best explained by postulating a regulatory function of the Fc portion of the IgG 1 anticarrier antibody, combined with the antigen, on the T cell.

Despite this, cyclophosphamide-treated animals were able to eliminate organisms more readily from the infected kidney than untreated animals with a normal humoral immune response.

Most studies have emphasized the role of peripheral forms of inhibition. In afferent enhancement, antibodies bound to the tumor cells interfere with immunogenicity (3).

There has been relatively little experimental evidence to support the central form of enhancement, in which immunological reactivity of sensitized cells is suppressed (6, 7). The relative in vivo roles of each of these mechanisms remains unclear.

40|$|<b>Immunological</b> <b>enhancement</b> {{is a form}} {{of active}} immunoregulation in which humoral {{antibodies}} suppress primary sensitization or block reaction in sensitized animals. In mouse serum the antibodies that suppress sensitization in mice (allogeneic enhancement) are predominantly 7 Sgamma 1 and those that block reaction 7 Sgamma 2 globulins.

We have studied these here as specifically effective against induction of tuberculin-typed delayed hypersensitivity to chicken conalbumin antigen. Guinea-pigs required prolonged and intense immunization with conalbumin to produce readily measurable titres of such antibodies. Their capacity to suppress mouse sensitization was antigenically specific. Of the three major classes of antibodies separated from the immunosuppressive guinea-pig antisera, the IgG 2 globulins were the most effective. These antibodies lost immunosuppressiveness if digested to either F(ab.) 2 or Fab fragments that retained antigen-binding capacities.

However, from the maternal viewpoint, it is well documented that sensitization against alien fetal isoantigens may occur as reflected by the appearance of humoral antibodies, but not by the acquisition of cellular immunity to solid tissue test homografts.

The contributions to allograft enhancement by the cellular-immune responses have not been rigorously assessed, although evidence for in vivo activity of cells capable of causing specific unresponsiveness has been found in other animal systems: for example, host responses against tumors may be influenced by cells or cellular products (8 - 10), which also act in delayed hypersensitivity (11 - 13) and graft-versus-host reactions (14 - 16).

Cytotoxic effects in the trophoblast monolayer were apparent after 72 hr incubation and depended on the presence of non-lymphoid cell types in addition to lymphocytes. Lysis of trophoblast was preceded by blast cell formation and apparently involved close contact between the maternal cells and the trophoblast cells. The nature of the cytotoxic reaction suggested the presence of histocompatibility factors on trypsinized trophoblast cells. This manifestation could be due to removal of fibrinoid or enhancing antibody from the cultured cells.

40|$|This paper reports {{tests of}} two {{hypotheses}} {{that have been}} proposed {{to account for the}} enhanced growth of tumor homografts in the presence of antiserum reactive with the graft (<b>immunological</b> <b>enhancement).</b> According to the first hypothesis, enhancement is due to some "physiological" alteration in the tumor, induced by its contact with antiserum, which insures its survival despite the hostile response of the host. According to the second hypothesis, antiserum alters the response of the host. By blocking the development of the cellular type of immunity, which is the main agent in graft destruction, it permits the graft to survive. To test hypothesis 1, strain A tumor SaI was passed from A's, and from enhanced B 10. D 2 's, into untreated B 10. D 2 's. The per cent of deaths was essentially the same in both groups (48 and 44 per cent, respectively); {{there was no evidence that}} passage through enhanced B 10. D 2 's altered the capacity of the tumor to grow in the foreign strain. Several other groups of mice included in the experiment all confirmed this conclusion. The experiment failed to confirm hypothesis 1. In the tests of hypothesis 2, the effect of isoantiserum on immune responses of both the humoral and cellular type was measured. When antiserum was given together with foreign strain lymphoid cells (antigen), almost no additional antibody was manufactured; in contrast with this, controls receiving foreign cells only produced red cell agglutinating antibody in high titer. The effect of antiserum on the development of immunity of the cellular type was tested by the method of Winn. In this assay, presumptively immune node cells, in various dilutions, are mixed with tumor cells and injected into appropriate mice. Immunity is indicated by inhibited tumor growth. Antiserum given at the same time as a tumor homograft greatly depressed the immunity of the cells expressed from the draining nodes. At 6 days after the graft, the level of immunity of cells from treated mice was 1 / 24 th to 1 / 32 nd that of cells from controls receiving tumor alone. The same sort of depressing effect was noted when the immunizing tissue was foreign thymus or embryo. Antiserum given 1 or more days after the immunizing tissue also resulted in a lower level of cellular immunity (but the assay used in this case was a less critical one). These results provide an adequate explanation of the phenomenon of <b>immunological</b> <b>enhancement,</b> at least as it occurs in the particular test system used in these experiments.

Sera from five of nine renal transplant recipients consistently and specifically suppressed autologous autologous MLC responses to donor cells without impairing the blastogenic responses to third-party leukocytes, soluble antigens, or nonspecific mitogenic agents. In three of the five cases the suppressive activity of the serum was striking; in two cases the effect was less marked but still readily demonstrable in studies designed to evaluate the dose of serum which provided optimal suppression of MLC responses. Serum from one of the recipients nonspecifically suppressed blastogenic activity both to donor cells and other stimuli. No alloantibody reactive with donor leukocytes was found in any of the sera which exhibited suppressive activity in MLC, whereas in one patient, serum which contained antibody reactive with donor cells did not suppress MLC response to that donor. These findings suggest that, if the serum factors which suppress MLC responses in vitro are enhancing antibodies, they are not detectable even with very sensitive techniques either because they are present in very low concentrations, belong to immunoglobulin classes other than IgA, IgG, or IgM, or are complexed with donor antigen {{in such a way that}} their ability to react with fresh donor cells in vitro is blocked...|$|E

In most instances, the MER evoked heightened resistance against the tumor implants, but heightened susceptibility was the effect induced against two of the tumors tested, and no effect was elicited against one neoplasm. It is suggested that the heightened susceptibility occasionally produced by pretreatment with MER may also be of immunological nature, i. e. <b>immunological</b> <b>enhancement.</b> Treatment with MER was more effective when administered some time before tumor challenge than when given simultaneously with, or after, tumor implantation.

Living BCG and intact phenol-killed bacilli also evoked heightened resistance against some of the tumors tested, and in one experiment living BCG proved effective whereas MER did not. On the whole, however, MER was the most active (and least toxic, as shown previously) of the several tubercle bacillus preparations tested.

The {{aim of this study}} is to demonstrate the efficiency of EBN in improving the immunity of mouse both in vivo and in vitro. We observed the effects of EBN on spleen lymphocytes proliferation and activation, as well as immunoglobulin isotypes as indicators. In addition, we evaluated the content of total sIgA in the intestinal juice to assess mucosal immunity. The results showed that EBN could promote the proliferation and activation of B-cells and increase IgE, IgA, IgM, and IgG 3 levels. We also found that EBN extract can promote the secretion of sIgA in the small intestine. Using cyclophosphamide (CY), we established an immunosuppressed mouse model in which we identified a reversal influence on the ratio of CD 3 +/CD 19 + cells, which indicates that EBN also protects B-cells from the damage induced by CY. We also applied polymyxin B to exclude the interference of lipopolysaccharide throughout the experiment. In conclusion, we found that EBN can reduce the intestinal immune injury induced by CY by accelerating the proliferation and activation of B-cells and enhancing antibody secretion of B-cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The {{results of}} class {{prediction}} and {{the determination of}} prognostic markers in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have been variably reported. Apart from biological variations, this {{may be caused by}} differences in laboratory techniques, scoring definitions and inter- and intra-observer variation. In this study, an international collaboration of clinical lymphoma research groups has concentrated on validation and standardisation of immunohistochemistry of the currently potentially interesting prognostic markers in DLBCL. METHODS: Sections of a tissue microarray with 36 cases of DLBCL were stained in eight laboratories with antibodies to CD 20, CD 5, bcl- 2, bcl- 6, CD 10, HLA-DR, MUM- 1 and Ki- 67 according to local methods. The study was performed in two rounds, firstly focused on the evaluation of laboratory staining variation, and secondly on the scoring variation. RESULTS: Different techniques resulted in highly variable results and poor reproducibility for almost all markers. Reproducibility of the nuclear markers was highly sensitive to technical variations, including <b>immunological</b> <b>enhancement</b> techniques (agreements 34 %). With elimination of variation due to staining and uniformly agreed on scoring criteria, significant improvement was seen; however less so for bcl- 6 and Ki- 67 (agreement 53 - 58 %). Absence of internal controls that preclude scoring, significantly influenced the results for CD 10 and bcl- 6. CONCLUSION: Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry for subclassification of DLBCL is feasible, but with varying rates of concordance for different markers and only using optimised techniques and strict scoring criteria. These findings may explain the wide variation in prognostic impact reported in the literature. Harmonisation of techniques and centralised consensus review appears mandatory when using immunohistochemical biomarkers for treatment stratificatio...|$|E
40|$|Lassa virus-infected cynomolgus monkeys were passively immunized with immune plasma of primate {{or human}} origin to {{gain insight into}} {{criteria}} for plasma selection and administration to human Lassa fever patients. Protective efficacy was correlated with neutralizing antibody concentrations, expressed as a log 10 neutralization index (LNI). Convalescent Lassa-immune monkey plasma was titrated for protective efficacy in monkeys by intravenous inoculation with dilutions of plasma {{on the day of}} subcutaneous Lassa virus inoculation (day 0) and again on days 3 and 6. Monkeys that received undiluted plasma (LNI = 4. 1) (1 ml/kg per treatment) survived a lethal viral dose, whereas those given a 1 : 3 dilution (LNI = 2. 6) of this same plasma (1 ml/kg per treatment) died. Protection was restored when the volume of the 1 : 3 plasma dilution was increased to 3 ml/kg per treatment. Plasma diluted 1 : 9 or more (LNI = 1. 5 or less) delayed onset and suppressed the magnitude of viremia but failed to confer protection at 3 ml/kg per treatment. <b>Immunological</b> <b>enhancement,</b> defined as increased viremia or accelerated death, did not occur following inadequate treatment. Human convalescent plasma also protected recipient monkeys; reductions in mortality and viremia were accurately predicted by the LNI of the plasma. Plasma of Liberian origin neutralized a Liberian Lassa strain more effectively than a Sierra Leone strain in vitro (LNI = 2. 8 and 1. 6, respectively) and protected monkeys more effectively against the Liberian strain. Geographic origin is thus a factor in the selection of optimal plasma for treatment of human Lassa fever, since geographically matched plasma is more likely to contain adequate LNI titers against homologous Lassa virus strains.
