5|$|For his {{services}} in Siberia, Eichelberger {{was awarded the}} Army Distinguished Service Medal, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 28 March 1919. Graves prevented him from receiving the British Distinguished Service Order and the French Legion of Honor, as had {{other members of the}} Inter-Allied Military Council. Eichelberger did, however, receive the Japanese Imperial Order of Meiji, Order of the Sacred Treasure and Order of the Rising Sun. Siberia gave Eichelberger a chance to observe the Japanese Army at first <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was impressed by what he saw of their training and discipline. He concluded that, if properly led, they would be more than a match for American troops. The American Expeditionary Force Siberia was withdrawn in April 1920.|$|E
25|$|To him, the Indian {{hostilities}} were {{a distraction}} from the job at <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> initiated a truce with Numaga that turned into a lasting peace.|$|E
25|$|The statue is cast {{in bronze}} and stands upon a square stone base with {{inscriptions}} on each side. The figure {{is that of}} a lone Confederate soldier, who stands facing south with his arms crossed. His wide-brimmed hat is clasped in his right <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is looking down toward the ground with a somber expression on his face. The soldier is facing south, {{the general direction of the}} battlefields of the Civil War.|$|E

60|$|We shook <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was so earnest and so {{kind that}} it made me quite choky.|$|R
60|$|Something {{was evidently}} the matter. His face was terrified. Two fellows gave him their <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> slithered up.|$|R
25|$|Daniel von Bargen as Commandant Edwin Spangler, {{the head}} of Marlin Academy. He is missing his right eye, his left hand, and his ring finger on his right <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> {{actually}} never served war time. He despises Francis because he fought against him. In the end, he loses his other hand and later is fired from Marlin Academy. After arriving in Alaska, Francis gets Spangler {{a job at a}} retirement home, which gives him free rein to bully the elderly.|$|E
25|$|As {{the battle}} at Cumberland Gap wore on, Morgan refused to retreat or {{surrender}} his position. Thinking {{an invasion of}} Kentucky was preferable to a long siege on the Gap, Smith left a detachment to handle Morgan and proceeded toward Lexington, abandoning the plan to join Bragg and capture Nashville. The move forced Bragg's <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> too entered Kentucky on August 28. As Smith progressed toward Lexington, Indiana governor Oliver P. Morton decided that Governor Robinson was doing too little to support the Union cause. He dispatched regiments across the Ohio into Louisville, and considered himself governor of both Indiana and Kentucky.|$|E
25|$|Archduke Joseph, {{who later}} became the emperor, arrived at Landau with his entourage of 250 courtiers on 26 July. Joseph took nominal command of the army, while Louis of Baden {{continued}} {{to make all the}} critical decisions. Two days later, when the Imperial army paraded for the archduke's inspection, Mélac believed that a relief army under Catinat was at <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> made preparations to defend against an assault. When the French commander finally realized what was going on, the frustrated Mélac sent a message asking where Joseph's headquarters was located so he could bombard it. Joseph, whose headquarters was out of range anyway, replied that the Frenchman must do his duty. The archduke visited the siege lines and even aimed some of the cannon. In one close call, Joseph was talking with a gunner when the man was hit in the chest by a bullet.|$|E

60|$|She {{bent forward}} to kiss his cheek, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> kissed hers. Then {{they looked at}} each other for an instant with clasped <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> turned away.|$|R
60|$|The {{emphasis}} in his tone, {{and a certain}} fixed look in his face chilled her. She held up her <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> stayed.|$|R
25|$|There {{are four}} large icons between the doors. These were {{probably}} painted by Mátyás Hittner, since their style slightly {{differs from the}} icons above. The paintings of the Sovereign follow the traditional placement. On the northern side of the iconostasis is the icon of Saint Nicholas. In Hajdúdorog he is depicted in an episcopal vestment. He makes the gesture of teaching or blessing with his right <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> holds a crosier and a white handkerchief in his left. The icon of the Theotokos {{is on the left}} of the Royal Door. It is a traditional depiction of mother Mary holding her child in her arms. The child Jesus holds a blue orb in his left representing his rule above both our world and the others. His right hand makes the same gesture as Saint Nicholas. The icon {{on the other side of}} the Royal Door is that of the Pantocrator, which is a specific depiction of Christ. The Pantocrator, like the Theotokos icon, holds an orb in his left and makes the teaching gesture with his right. An open book lies before him, probably the New Testament based on the traditional depiction.|$|E
25|$|The two icons {{on either}} side of the Royal Doors are rather similar: Jesus was painted with an orb in his left <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> makes the same gesture with his right in both pictures. However, the icon of the Theotokos {{represents}} Jesus' first appearance among humans, while the Pantocrator icon refers to his second coming. Thus the royal gate– and with that the most important movements of the holy service– is situated between the first and the second coming of Jesus. There is another interesting relationship between the two paintings. In Byzantine iconography Mary and Jesus usually wear blue or white garments covered by a red toga. After the death of Christ the colors are inverted. This change appears on the Theotokos and the Pantocrator icons: Mary wears a white tunic with a red toga; the Pantocrator on the other side wears a red garment with a blue toga. The Virgin also wears a blue on red garment on the top of the iconostasis, when mourning her son's death. In Christian art, the combination of blue and red has further significance: red refers to the divine origin and blue symbolizes human nature. This is the reason Christian art so often depicts Jesus in red and blue garments.|$|E
25|$|The French recaptured Le Quesnoy, Valenciennes and Condé-sur-l'Escaut in August. By mid-September the Coalition-held fortesses in rear {{were reduced}} and the French resumed their {{advance to the}} north. On 2 December 1794, the Duke of York {{returned}} to Great Britain, leaving Lieutenant General Count Wallmoden to take command of the 45,000-man Coalition army in the Dutch Republic. At that time there were 32 British battalions and 30 squadrons, 14 Hanoverian battalions and 16 squadrons, 14 Hessian battalions and 14 squadrons and eight French Royalist battalions and 20 squadrons. On 10 December, {{under the direction of}} Daendels, the French launched an amphibious operation across the Maas against the Bommelerwaard. The attack on Fort Sint-Andries failed completely because the garrison was warned by a French deserter. To the east, a diversionary attack led by Vandamme crossed the Waal under the cover of a fog and seized a Hanoverian battery near Gendt. Bussche appeared with the 1st and 3rd Hanoverian Grenadier Battalions and counterattacked. After a struggle in which Bussche was killed, the French spiked some of the guns and withdrew to their boats. According to one account, a cannonball tore off Bussche's <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> died soon afterward. He was buried in the cathedral of Arnhem on 14 December 1794.|$|E

Ottone, now disguised as Drusilla, enters the garden and raises his sword to kill Poppea. Before he can do so, Love strikes the sword from his <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> runs away. His fleeing figure is seen by Arnalta and the now awakened Poppea, who {{believe that he is}} Drusilla. They call on their servants to give chase, while Love sings triumphantly [...] "I protected her!" ...|$|E
500|$|... talks so {{much about}} experiments, {{it may be to}} him, but to us it is no experiment, as we are just as certain that the relief of his eagle will never coin, as we are certain that the Sun will rise each morning, and the only object in all this trouble and waste of money is to {{convince}} those who will be convinced in no other way... I think our friend [...] is playing a game... but our willingness, nay more, our desire to let the work tell its own story has rather called his <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is not prepared to show it, and therefore is sparing for wind, or time.|$|E
60|$|So spoke Brissenden, faint from a {{hemorrhage}} of {{half an hour}} before--the second hemorrhage {{in three}} days. The perennial whiskey glass was in his <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> drained it with shaking fingers.|$|R

Skírnir again reminds Gerðr of his blade and predicts that Gerðr's jötunn father will meet his doom with it. Skírnir warns Gerðr that he will strike her with his Gambanteinn, a wand, that it will tame her to his desires, and says that she will never again be seen by [...] "the sons of men". From early morning, Gerðr will sit on an eagle's mound, looking outward to the world, facing Hel, and that [...] "food shall be more hateful to you than to every man is the shining serpent among men".|$|E

"Wittgenstein was {{insisting that}} a {{proposition}} {{and that which}} it describes must have the same 'logical form', the same 'logical multiplicity', Sraffa made a gesture, familiar to Neapolitans as meaning something like disgust or contempt, of brushing the underneath of his chin with an outward sweep of the finger-tips of one <b>hand.</b> <b>And</b> <b>he</b> asked: 'What is the logical form of that?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{finishing}} military {{school in}} 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout.

Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice University in Houston, Texas. [...] He graduated from Rice in 1955 with a baccalaureate in physics. He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, where he earned his doctorate in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965.|$|E

2500|$|Pingle {{attended}} {{a conference in}} the morning on January 10, 1928. He returned to his home shortly after noon. He felt a pricking sensation in his <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was unable to use it and his wife urged him to go have a nap. Pingle died at 7:20 pm that day at his residence in Medicine Hat, of what was reported to be [...] "cardiac troubles" [...] or a stroke. He had been in poor health in the years preceding his death. His funeral was attended by various members of provincial and municipal governments, political associations, and communities with which he was associated. St. Barbanas Church, in which it was held, was filled to its capacity, and many people had to stand outside. He was interred at the Hillside Cemetery in Medicine Hat. His wife, Jean, was buried beside him upon her death on September 6, 1944.|$|E
