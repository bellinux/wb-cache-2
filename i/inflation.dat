5|$|Because of the {{long-term}} effects of <b>inflation,</b> notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for <b>inflation</b> gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for <b>inflation,</b> but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and <b>inflation</b> do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of <b>inflation</b> around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of radiofrequency-powered thermal balloon angioplasty in an in vivo porcine model. Background. Various modes of thermal energy used adjunctively during balloon angioplasty have demonstrated the potential to enhance the results of acute lumen dilation. Methods. In normal pigs, 75 peripheral arteries were dilated with a newly designed, radiofrequency-powered, thermal angioplasty balloon. All <b>inflations</b> were performed at 2 -atm pressure for 85 s. Dilations were performed either with (hot) or without (cold) the application of heat. Lumen dimensions and vessel morphology were assessed with intravascular ultrasonography. At the end of each study, dilated arterial segments were harvested for histologic examination. Results. Single cold balloon <b>inflations</b> resulted in a 12. 7 % increase in arterial cross-sectional area whereas single hot <b>inflations</b> resulted in a 22. 9 % increase (p < 0. 03). Similarly, when multiple cold <b>inflations</b> were compared with multiple hot <b>inflations,</b> two, three and four sequential hot <b>inflations</b> resulted in a significantly greater increase in cross-sectional area than an equivalent number of cold <b>inflations</b> (p < 0. 03). Histologic examination demonstrated a temperaturedependent effect on the depth of medial necrosis and extent of arterial wall thinning (p < 0. 001) as well as evidence for uniform alteration of elastic tissue fibers at temperatures of ≥ 60 °C (p < 0. 03). Conclusions. Low pressure radiofrequency thermal balloon angioplasty results in a greater increase in cross-sectional area in porcine peripheral arteries than does nonheated conventional balloon angioplasty. The pathologic basis for this enhanced dilation may be a temperature-dependent effect on medial necrosis, thinning of the arterial wall or alteration of vascular elastic fibers, alone or in combination...|$|R

40|$|There are {{currently}} no objective means of quantifying chest wall vibrations during manual physiotherapy. The {{aims of the}} study were to (i) develop a method to quantify physiotherapy-applied forces and simultaneous changes in respiratory flow and pressure, (ii) assess the feasibility of using this method in ventilated children and (iii) characterize treatment profiles delivered by physiotherapists in the paediatric intensive care unit. Customized sensing mats were designed and used in combination with a respiratory profile monitor. Software was developed to align force and flow data streams. Force and respiratory data were successfully collected in 55 children (median age 1. 6 years (range 0. 02 - 13. 7 years)). Physiotherapists demonstrated distinctive variations in the pattern of force applied and manual lung <b>inflations.</b> The maximum applied force ranged from 15 to 172 N, and was correlated with the child's age (r = 0. 76). Peak expiratory flow increased significantly during manual <b>inflations</b> both with and without chest wall vibrations (p < 0. 05).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the hypothesis that the increase in lumen area induced by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is secondary to a change in lesion (segmental) distensibility. Background. Despite the widespread use of coronary angioplasty, the precise mechanism (or mechanisms) of lumen area improvement remains poorly understood. Methods. Quantitative coronary angiography was used to measure the minimal (contrast agent filled) balloon diameters at 1 to 5 atm, inclusive, during the first and final balloon <b>inflations</b> in 24 lesions successfully treated with coronary angioplasty. To rule out possible confounding effects due to changes in balloon material distensibility during repeated <b>inflations,</b> five control balloons were studied ex vivo. In parallel, intravascular ultrasound imaging was utilized to compare the segmental distensibility (change in lumen area during the cardiac cycle) of eight disease-free and seven mildly diseased coronary segments and seven segments after successful balloon angioplasty. Results. Minimal balloon diameters increased significantly between the first and final <b>inflations</b> (46 %, 33 %, 26 %, 14 % and 10 % at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 atm, respectively, all p < 0. 0001), demonstrating an increase in arterial distensibility after successful coronary angioplasty. No significant changes in balloon diameters were observed during sequential initial <b>inflations</b> at 1 and 2 atm (n = 5). Minimal increases in Balloon diameters were observed during repeated balloon <b>inflations</b> in the ex vivo studies (4. 9 ± 1 % [mean ± SEM]). A distensibility index, derived from the intravascular ultrasound data, was not different between the balloon-dilated and the normal segments but was significantly lower in mildly diseased sites (14. 7 ± 2. 2 vs. 12. 9 ± 1. 2 vs. 6. 9 ± 1. 9, respectively, p < 0. 05) despite a smaller plaque area (7. 3 ± 1 vs. 11. 3 ± 1 mm 2, proximal/nondilated vs. dilated segments, respectively, p < 0. 05). Conclusions. Coronary distensibility is significantly impaired in atherosclerotically diseased coronary segments and increases significantly after balloon angioplasty. This increase in segmental coronary compliance after coronary angioplasty may create a larger lumen area by allowing the vessel to distend in response to normal intraarterial pressure...|$|R

40|$|If the 19 th century {{urban center}} {{was a city}} of manufacturing, and the early 20 th century city was one of {{corporate}} capitalism, today's downtown can best be characterized as a site of culture and consumption, from the Guggenheim Bilbao to Times Square in Manhattan. Downtown Houston is at a disadvantage in this contemporary context, for it lacks any density of cultural institutions. Sites of entertainment and culture are instead spread throughout the greater Houston metropolitan area. This dispersal creates islands of culture, but leaves downtown Houston without a cohesive cultural identity. By tweaking municipal policy and exploiting untapped sites, this thesis seeks to inflate cultural space in downtown Houston (and by cultural space, I mean everything from the symphony to contemporary art to Karaoke). <b>Inflations</b> promote {{a new way to}} transform the city. Rather than make big change through big cultural projects, <b>Inflations</b> are small iterative structures where transformations occur through a set of connections: infrastructural and visual. Already in place in downtown Houston is a seven mile system of tunnels and skywalks that has led to an evacuation of the street and a fragmented downtown public. By slowly infusing forms into this downtown infrastructure a new culture map is made. Through an accumulation of <b>Inflations</b> these small structures become sites of consistent visible exchange: point moments of cultural activity placed in a once banal infrastructural system...|$|R
