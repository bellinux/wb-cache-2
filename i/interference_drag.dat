25|$|Most of {{the other}} {{multi-engined}} jet aircraft in existence, when the Il-22 was being designed, either had the engines in a nacelle (singly or in pairs) directly attached to {{the underside of the}} wing or were buried in the wing itself. Clustering them in a nacelle offered several advantages over individual nacelles as it reduced overall drag and minimized <b>interference</b> <b>drag,</b> but had the major operational disadvantage that an uncontained fire in one engine could disable its neighbor as well and the early jet engines were not reliable, so this was a significant risk. Ilyushin chose to put the TR-1 engines ahead and below the wing leading edge on short horizontal pylons. This gave them the beneficial effect of acting as anti-flutter weights and proved to be more efficient aerodynamically than underwing nacelles. This also facilitated engine changes and maintenance by making them more accessible to the ground crews.|$|E

2500|$|The H.31 was {{a single}} bay biplane with {{straight}} edged, parallel chord wings with slight sweep and essentially no stagger; {{the leading edge of}} the lower wing was marginally behind that of the upper one because its chord was a little less. It also had a slightly smaller span. A single, wide chord, airfoil section interplane strut on each side, with widened roots to lower <b>interference</b> <b>drag,</b> separated the bays; on each side pairs of flying wires and landing wires provided cross bracing between these struts and the fuselage. The wings were built around twin Duralumin box main spars, with metal and wood ribs. [...] There were ailerons on the upper planes. [...] Neither wing was directly fuselage mounted but instead held off by pairs of N-form struts on each side. Those joining the lower wing to the low-mid fuselage were longer than those of the cabane and the lower forward component was itself a close pair. Both upper and lower wings had the common cut-outs to improve the pilot's vision but the H.31 had a forward, full chord slot between the upper wings as well.|$|E

50|$|<b>Interference</b> <b>drag</b> {{plays a role}} {{throughout}} the entire aircraft (e.g., nacelles, pylons, empennage) and its detrimental effect is always kept in mind by designers. Ideally, the pressure distributions on the intersecting bodies should complement each other’s pressure distribution. If one body locally displays a negative pressure coefficient, the intersecting body should have a positive pressure coefficient. In reality, however, {{this is not always}} possible. Particular geometric characteristics on aircraft often show how designers have dealt with the issue of <b>interference</b> <b>drag.</b> A prime example is the wing-body fairing, which smooths the sharp angle at the intersection of the wing and the fuselage. Another example is the junction between the horizontal and vertical tailplane in a T-tail. Often, an additional fairing (acorn) is positioned to reduce the added supervelocities. The position of the nacelle with respect to the wing is a third example of how interference-drag considerations dominate this geometric feature. <b>Interference</b> <b>drag</b> is considered when deciding the lateral and longitudinal placement of nacelles on the wing. If there is little vertical space available between the wing and the nacelle (due to need for ground clearance) the nacelle is usually positioned much more in front of the wing. The NACA area rule is one approach to reducing transonic <b>interference</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E

This experimental study quantifies the products temperature and the energy consumption of the VORDC when there is an interference due to consumers passing in front of the VORDC. The tests were performed in a test room according to ISO 23953 using a robotic mannequin (MARIA - Mannequin for Automatic Replication of the Interference in the Air curtain) that systematically passes in front of the VORDC.
