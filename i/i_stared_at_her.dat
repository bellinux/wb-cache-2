60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> It was {{the most}} amazing moment in any life....|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and inquired her name, because I did {{not know}} what else to say.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Last night! It {{seemed a}} long while ago--so very {{unimportant}} what I might have said.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{could only}} <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in stupid surprise. <b>Her</b> eyes blazed <b>at</b> me, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly a {{cold wind}} did blow in and filled the hall with a whirl of snow. But there on the {{threshold}} stood a form of flesh and blood--Mary Vance, coated {{from head to foot}} with snow--and she brought Life, not Death, with her, though I didn't know that then. <b>I</b> just <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|How oddly chance repeats itself. The {{door opened}} and once more, unannounced, Miss Fenne {{appeared}} in our midst. My father hastily rose to greet her, pretending that nothing was amiss. But when {{she held out her}} clawlike hand to me to be kissed, <b>I</b> merely <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She screwed up her countenance into a smile; mumbled that I was looking pale and peaked again; and, with difficulty keeping her eyes from mine, explained that she had come for a business talk with my father.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in bewilderment. In {{contrast}} to the agitation I felt rising within me, she was extraordinarily calm, unbelievably so.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> for move I could not. Then remembering my crazy {{talk with}} Kari, uttered one word, only one. It was--Quilla.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and my jaw dropped. Then I {{recovered}} myself, {{thinking she}} must {{have made a mistake}} and meant to say [...] "week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “What’s {{the good}} of getting you {{anything}} to eat, my dear young Monsieur,” she quizzed me tenderly. “You just only peck like a little bird. Much better let me save the money for you.” It will show the super-terrestrial nature of my misery when I say that I was quite surprised at Therese’s view of my appetite. Perhaps she was right. I certainly did not know. <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{and in the end}} she admitted that the dinner was in fact ready that very moment.|$|R
40|$|Technical: This looped video work {{is made up}} from {{a number}} of still images {{animated}} in a sequence, not intended to be a smooth action, but syncopated. The gaps in real time suggest blinking, lapses in technology, warps in time and distance. The still images have been manipulated in photoshop and imported into an animation software program, showing subtle emphasis on various aspects of the features of the face and location from the screen shots. Content: Obsession {{is one of the most}} constant expressions of love, whether it is a negative attribute, such as stalking, or the need to see or stroke the beloved, or telling and re-telling the story of first meeting. “like the beat, beat, beat of the tom tom when the jungle shadows fall like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock as it stands against the wall like the drip, drip drip of the rain drops when the summer shower’s through a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you… only you [...] . ” (Cole Porter, Night and Day) My desire to immerse myself in my newly-met adult daughter as a reality is as obsessive as any new parent. The primary means of contact is video cam, which has become a kind of surveillance for me. <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mouth as it moves, her ear as she moves her head, her smile, her grimaces, her high cheekbones, her eyes that are like mine, the shape of her head, her teeth that are like her father’s… hundreds of candid pictures screen shot over a year and a half were the source of the video images...|$|R
60|$|Well, {{when she}} said that <b>I</b> fairly <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> for <b>I</b> had thought that she could never have quite forgiven me for the way I used to carry on. That anyone out of a daft house could have liked it, was clean beyond my understanding. I thought of how when she was reading by the door I would go up on the moor with a hazel switch and fix little clay balls at the end of it, and sling them <b>at</b> <b>her</b> until I made her cry. And then I thought of how I caught an eel in the Corriemuir burn and chivied her about with it, until she ran {{screaming}} under my mother's apron half mad with fright, and my father gave me one on the ear-hole with the porridge stick which knocked me and my eel under the kitchen dresser. And these were the things that she missed! Well, she must miss them, for my hand would wither before I could do them now. But for the first time I began to understand the queerness that lies in a woman, and that a man must not reason about one, but just watch and try to learn.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> amazed. 'But, Lady Georgina,' I cried, 'you {{said you}} wished {{to protect your}} nephew against bare-faced adventuresses who were setting their caps at him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was drunk," [...] she said. <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in frightened wonderment. [...] "He was drunk--it {{is better}} than if he had cursed me. He did not mention me? Or any one?" ...|$|E
60|$|Speechless <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> a moment, {{so taken}} was I with {{the immensity of}} the thing that she suggested. Fear, amazement, and joy jostled one another for the {{possession}} of my mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{coming to}} be of the same opinion, Miss Cushing," [...] said Holmes, taking a seat beside her. [...] "I think that it is more than probable--" [...] He paused, and I was surprised, on glancing round to see that he was staring with {{singular}} intentness at the lady's profile. Surprise and satisfaction were both for an instant to be read upon his eager face, though when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he had become as demure as ever. <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> hard myself <b>at</b> <b>her</b> flat, grizzled hair, her trim cap, her little gilt earrings, her placid features; but I could see nothing which could account for my companion's evident excitement.|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} <b>I</b> could only <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in bewildered terror. Far from {{recognizing}} me, {{she seemed to}} be absorbed in a nymph-like contemplation of her own graces in the pool. Then I called [...] "Consuelo!" [...] and galloped frantically around the spring. But there was no response, nor was there anything to be seen but the all-unconscious Chu Chu. The pool, thank Heaven! was not deep enough to have drowned any one; there were no signs of a struggle on its quaggy edges. The horse might have come from a distance! I galloped on, still calling. A few hundred yards further I detected the vivid glow of Chu Chu's scarlet saddle-blanket, in the brush near the trail. My heart leaped--I was on the track. I called again; this time a faint reply, in accents I knew too well, came from the field beside me! ...|$|R
40|$|Today I {{found out}} that I am HIV {{positive}} [...] . I have never kept a diary before. I have always had someone to confide in. Now, I don’t even know how I will begin facing this. I have cried the whole day and yet feel an icy calm like this cannot be true. In the 3 days that it took for the doctor {{to give me the}} results of the test it never once crossed my mind that this could happen to me. I have always been careful about whom I trust, I have slept with very few men, yet one of those must have been HIV positive and possibly infected me. How is it possible that my life has changed so dramatically in just one second? When the nurse came back through the door where she had gone to fetch the results, I immediately knew that something was wrong. <b>I</b> stupidly <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> identification pin, which was hanging from <b>her</b> blouse <b>at</b> an angle when she stretched out her hand to give me the envelope. I just could not get myself to take the paper into my hands – I knew my life {{would never be the same}} again. My eyes could not focus when I finally reached for the blue piece of paper; it took me forever to interpret what was on it. Seeing my distress, the nurse asked me to wait to speak to a counselor but instead I stumbled outside into my ca...|$|R
60|$|For a time <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and was motionless, {{in a sort}} {{of still}} and weary amazement. Why had we done this injury to one another? WHY? Then {{something}} stirred within me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{somewhat}} {{appalled by}} this point of view. There had, indeed, been signs of its development before now, but I had not heeded them. And {{for the first time}} I beheld Maude in a new light.|$|E
6000|$|She did {{not succeed}} (and would not, even had she tried much harder) in making it seem to me {{anything}} less than monstrous. <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and I think I blushed. [...] "Don't you admire his genius? Don't you admire Beltraffio?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Catherine also {{received}} Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun (formerly court painter to Marie Antoinette) <b>at</b> <b>her</b> Tsarskoye Selo residence in St Petersburg, by {{whom she was}} painted shortly before her death. Madame Vigée Le Brun vividly describes the empress in her memoirs: [...] "the sight of this famous woman so impressed me that I {{found it impossible to}} think of anything: <b>I</b> could only <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Firstly <b>I</b> was very surprised <b>at</b> <b>her</b> small stature; I had imagined her to be very tall, as great as her fame. She was also very fat, but her face was still beautiful, and she wore her white hair up, framing it perfectly. Her genius seemed to rest on her forehead, which was both high and wide. Her eyes were soft and sensitive, her nose quite Greek, her colour high and her features expressive. She addressed me immediately in a voice full of sweetness, if a little throaty: [...] "I am delighted to welcome you here, Madame, your reputation runs before you. I am very fond of the arts, especially painting. I am no connoisseur, but I am a great art lover." ...|$|R
6000|$|This lasted till Long {{came back}} with his porter, {{as well as with}} a lady unknown to me and to whom he had {{apparently}} mentioned that our carriage would pleasantly accommodate her. The porter carried in fact her dressing-bag, which he put upon a seat and the bestowal of which left the lady presently free to turn to me with a reproach: [...] "I don't think it very nice of you not to speak to me." [...] <b>I</b> <b>stared,</b> then caught <b>at</b> <b>her</b> identity through her voice; after which I reflected that she might easily have thought me the same sort of ass as I had thought Long. For she was simply, it appeared, Grace Brissenden. We had, the three of us, the carriage to ourselves, and we journeyed together for more than an hour, during which, in my corner, I had my companions opposite. We began at first by talking a little, and then as the train--a fast one--ran straight and proportionately bellowed, we gave up the effort to compete with its music. Meantime, however, we had exchanged with each other a fact or two to turn over in silence. Brissenden was coming later--not, indeed, that that was such a fact. But his wife was informed--she knew about the numerous others; she had mentioned, while we waited, people and things: that Obert, R.A., was somewhere in the train, that her husband was to bring on Lady John, and that Mrs. Froome and Lord Lutley were in the wondrous new fashion--and their servants too, like a single household--starting, travelling, arriving together. It came back to me as I sat there that when she mentioned Lady John as in charge of Brissenden the other member of our trio had expressed interest and surprise--expressed it so as to have made her reply with a smile: [...] "Didn't you really know?" [...] This passage had taken place on the platform while, availing ourselves of our last minute, we hung about our door.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him and {{repeated}} the word. He beamed pleasantly upon me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] Mrs Fyne {{said very}} {{unexpectedly}} like a steel trap going off. <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> How provoking she was! So I {{went on to}} finish my tirade. [...] "She struck me at first sight as the most inconsiderate wrongheaded girl that I ever..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha!" [...] said she. [...] "But what a {{world with}} only one! Jupiter has scores, hasn't he? Just think of his Love Lanes!" [...] She {{rose to her feet}} with a sigh of boredom, and {{smoothed}} out her skirts with her long, narrow hands. <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> beauty in amazement.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Was this Mameena myth to be dug {{up again}} in a secret place {{in the heart of}} Africa? And how the deuce did she know {{anything}} about Mameena? Could she have been questioning Hans or Umslopogaas? No, it was not possible, for she had never seen them out of my presence.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him, {{thinking}} that the Administrator's champagne had got into his head.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him doubtfully, for {{at times}} a pleasantry {{came out of}} his bitterness.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him in amazement. And no wonder. The {{young man}} was Duncan Woodward.|$|R
6000|$|... "I DID notice her," [...] said David emphatically, darting a keen side {{glance at}} his friend. [...] "I noticed her most {{particularly}} and critically--for someone whispered her name behind me and coupled it with the exceedingly interesting information that Miss Campion {{was supposed to be}} the future Mrs. Eric Marshall. Whereupon <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with all my eyes." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{and replied}} that I did not {{understand}} what she meant, since women, so far as I had observed them, were generally in love either with a man or with themselves, perhaps more often with the latter than the former. Rather a cheap joke I admit, with just enough truth in it to make it acceptable--in the Black Kloof.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{face in the}} starlight, and oh! it {{had grown}} splendid. No longer was it that of a woman, since through it, like light through pearl, shone a soul divine. It {{might have been a}} goddess who stood beside me, for those eyes were holy and her embrace that wrapped me close was not that of the flesh alone.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him in {{speechless}} amazement. The words, for an instant, absolutely petrified me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him in {{speechless}} consternation, and for {{a moment}} I seemed forlorn of sense and understanding.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Gip, and Gip <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me, {{and there}} were our distortions in the magic mirrors, looking very rum, and grave, and quiet...|$|R
