[...] On the whole though, ice-crystal {{clouds in the}} upper troposphere tend to favor net warming. [...] However, the cooling effect is dominant with mid-level and low clouds made of very small water droplets with an average radius of about 2µm (0.00008in)., [...] especially when they form in extensive sheets that block out more of the sun. [...] Small-droplet aerosols are not good at absorbing long-wave radiation reflected back from Earth, {{so there is a}} net cooling with almost no long-wave effect. [...] This effect is particularly pronounced with low clouds that form over water. [...] Measurements taken by NASA indicate that on the whole, the effects of low and mid-level clouds that tend to promote cooling are outweighing the warming effects of <b>high</b> <b>layers</b> and the variable outcomes associated with or vertically developed clouds.|$|E
50|$|CBUT {{is based}} on both {{software}} architectural views such as model-view-controller (MVC), presentation-abstraction-control (PAC), ICON and CNUCE agent models that split up the software in parts, and cognitive psychology views where a person's mental process is split up in smaller mental processes. Both software architecture and cognitive architecture use the principle of hierarchical layering, in which low level processes are more elementary and for humans often more physical in nature, such as the coordination movement of muscle groups. Processes that operate on higher level layers are more abstract and focus on a person's main goal, such as writing an application letter to get a job. The layered protocol theory (LPT), which is a special version of perceptual control theory (PCT), brings these views together by suggesting that users interact with a system across several layers by sending messages. Users interact with components on <b>high</b> <b>layers</b> by sending messages, such as pressing keys, to components operating on lower layers, which on their turn relay a series of these messages into a single high level message, such as 'DELETE *.*', to a component on a higher layer. Components operating on higher layers, communicate back to the user by sending messages to components operating on lower level layers. Whereas this layered-interaction model explains how the interaction is established, control loops explain {{the purpose of the}} interaction. LPT sees the purpose of the users' behaviour as the users' attempt to control their perception, in this case the state of the component they perceive. This means that users will only act if they perceive the component to be in an undesirable state. For example, if a person have an empty glass but want a full glass of water, he or she will act (e.g. walk to the tap, turning the tap on to fill the glass). The action of filling the glass will continue until the person perceives the glass as full. As interaction with components takes places on several layers, interacting with a single device can include several control loops. The amount of effort put into operating a control loop is seen as an indicator for the usability of an interaction component.|$|E

However, during inference the lower layers {{do not know}} about high layer features, although they contain contextual high semantics that benefit low layers to adaptively extract informative features for later layers. In this paper, we study the influence of backward skip connections which are {{in the opposite direction}} to forward shortcuts, i. e. paths from <b>high</b> <b>layers</b> to low layers. To achieve this [...] which indeed runs counter to the nature of feed-forward networks [...] we propose a new fully convolutional model that consists of a pair of networks.

30|$|The {{effective}} classification {{methods of}} the small target objects in the no-fly zone are of great significance to ensure safety in the no-fly zone. But, due to the differences of the color and texture for the small target objects in the sky, this may be unobvious, such as the birds, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and kites. In this paper, we introduced the <b>higher</b> <b>layer</b> visualizing feature extraction method based on the hybrid deep network model to obtain the <b>higher</b> <b>layer</b> feature through combining the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) model, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, and the regression classifier model to classify {{the different types of}} the target object images. In addition, because the sample numbers of the small sample target objects in the sky may be not sufficient, we cannot obtain much more local features directly to realize the classification of the target objects based on the <b>higher</b> <b>layer</b> visualizing feature extraction; we introduced the transfer learning in the SAE model to gain the cross-domain <b>higher</b> <b>layer</b> local visualizing features and sent the cross-domain <b>higher</b> <b>layer</b> local visualizing features and the images of the target-domain small sample object images into the CNN model, to acquire the global visualizing features of the target objects.

40|$|A sensory mapping method, called "Staggered Hierarchical Mapping (SHM)," and its {{developmental}} algorithm {{are described}} in this paper. SHM is a model motivated by human early visual pathways including processing performed by the retina, Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex. The work reported here concerns not only the design of such a series of processors but also their autonomous development. A new Incremental Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) method is used to automatically develop orientation sensitive and other needed filters. A set of staggered receptive fields model the pattern of positioning of processing cells. From sequentially sensed video frames, the proposed algorithm develops a hierarchy of filters, whose outputs are uncorrelated within each layer, but with increasing scale of receptive fields from low to <b>high</b> <b>layers.</b> To study the completeness of the representation generated by the SHM, we experimentally show that the response produced at any layer is sufficient to reconstruct the corresponding "retinal" image to a great degree.

The characteristics of this extreme weather and its linkage to the TP surface heating anomaly were analyzed in this paper.

Correlation analysis reveals that TP heating anomalies are closely associated with these Rossby wave trains; (4) the Rossby wave propagates downstream from the TP to South China in the mid and <b>high</b> <b>layers</b> of the atmosphere when the TP changes swiftly from a heat sink to a heat source.

40|$|For {{large-scale}} distributed systems, Data centric communication {{based on}} the publish/subscribe paradigm {{plays a key role}} on traffic volume control. More data filtering efficient and adaptive to different traffic conditions bring some solutions at the <b>high</b> <b>layers</b> of the communication model. Data Distribution Service (DDS) and OLE for Process Control Data Exchange (OPC-DX) are the most adopted solutions, in real-time data centric sensor networks. Some Real-time transport and Medium access control (MAC) protocols are proposed in the literature to support these types of networks. Existing MAC protocols, scheduling based, collision free, contention based or hybrid schemes focus more on optimizing system throughput and do not adequately consider the requirements of sensor networks. The key challenge remains to provide predictable delay and/or prioritization guarantees while minimizing overhead packets and energy consumption. It is widely known that Control Area Networks (CAN) protocol is used in real-time, distributed and parallel processing.

Both low and high spatial resolution spectra of Fe I 6301. 5 and Fe I 6302. 5 ˚A obtained with the Advanced Stokes Polarimeter (ASP) have been considered for analysis. The thin flux tube approximation, implemented in an LTE inversion code based on response functions, is used to describe unresolved magnetic elements. The code allows the simultaneous and consistent inference of all atmospheric quantities determining the radiative transfer with the sole assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium.

40|$|Deep neural {{networks}} are highly expressive models that have recently achieved {{state of the}} art performance on speech and visual recognition tasks. While their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninter-pretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this paper we report two such properties. First, we find that there is no distinction between individual high level units and random linear combinations of high level units, according to various methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather than the individual units, that contains of the semantic information in the <b>high</b> <b>layers</b> of {{neural networks}}. Second, we find that deep neural networks learn input-output mappings that are fairly discontinuous to a significant extend. Specifically, we find that we can cause the network to misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible pertur-bation, which is found by maximizing the network’s prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input. ...|$|E
