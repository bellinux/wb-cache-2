25|$|The 13Jupiter-mass cutoff is a rule {{of thumb}} rather than {{something}} of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the 13Jupiter mass value <b>is</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between.</b> The amount of deuterium burnt also depends to some extent on the composition of the object, specifically on the amount of helium and deuterium present and on the fraction of heavier elements, which determines the atmospheric opacity and thus the radiative cooling rate.|$|E

Large objects will fuse most of their deuterium and smaller ones will fuse only a little, and the 13 [...] value <b>is</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between.</b> In fact, calculations show that an object fuses 50% of its initial deuterium content when the total mass ranges between 12 and 14 [...] The amount of deuterium fused depends not only on mass {{but also on the}} composition of the object, on the amount of helium and deuterium present. The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia includes objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, saying, [...] "The fact that there is no special feature around 13 [...] in the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice to forget this mass limit." [...] The Exoplanet Data Explorer includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory: [...] "The 13 Jupiter-mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores, and observationally problematic due to the sin i ambiguity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the term}} [...] "clitic" [...] {{can be used}} descriptively to refer to any element whose {{grammatical}} status <b>is</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between</b> a typical word and a typical affix, linguists have proposed various definitions of [...] "clitic" [...] as a technical term. One common approach is to treat clitics as words that are prosodically deficient: they cannot appear without a host, and they can only form an accentual unit in combination with their host. The term [...] "postlexical clitic" [...] is used for this narrower sense of the term.|$|E

5000|$|A {{middleman}} minority is {{a minority}} population whose considerable occupations <b>are</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between</b> the producers and consumers: traders, money-lenders, etc., hence the word [...] "" [...] in the term.

50|$|After World War II, {{the concept}} of a united Europe began to take shape. The ideas of a unified Europe varied in degree.

50|$|According to Finkelberg, most—if not all—inscriptions found outside Crete {{were made}} locally. This is {{indicated}} by such factors as {{the composition of the}} material on which the inscriptions were made.

50|$|Proofing {{can either}} be viewed subjectively as an art based on training, experience, talent and judgment; or objectively as a science based on measurement, algorithms, and analysis; but in {{practice}} it <b>is</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between.</b> Increasingly, however, printers rely on scientific methods, as it is often more cost-effective to buy the necessary technology than to acquire, train and retain skilled artisans.|$|E
5000|$|To enable {{open market}} operations, {{a central bank}} must hold foreign {{exchange}} reserves (usually {{in the form of}} government bonds) and official gold reserves.

50|$|Analysis {{of travel}} {{behavior}} {{from the home}} can answer the question: How does the family participate in modern society. Consider two non-observable extremes. At one extreme we have the non-specialized household. It does everything for itself, and no travel is required. Ultimate specialization is the other extreme; travel is required for all things. Observed households <b>are</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between.</b> The “in between” position of households might {{be thought of as}} the consequence of two matters.|$|R
