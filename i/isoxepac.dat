40|$|Nineteen {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis entered a double-blind cross-over study, comparing a new anti-inflammatory agent <b>isoxepac,</b> 200 mg three times daily, with aspirin 1. 2 g three times daily. Eighteen patients completed 2 â€” 4 weeks treatment with each drug. The treatments were similar when assessed by measurement of joint pain, grip strength, morning stiffness, patients ' global assessment and overall preference. Significantly fewer adverse effects {{were associated with}} <b>isoxepac</b> therapy when compared with aspirin therapy. <b>ISOXEPAC</b> (6,ll-Dihydro-ll-oxodibenzU>,e]oxepin- 2 -acetic acid) is a non-steroid anti-inflammatory agent which is potent in inhibiting carrageenan paw oedema, adjuvant induced polyarthritis and prostaglandin synthesis (Lassman et al., 1977); the separation between anti-inflammatory and ulcerogenic potency in rats is at least 10 times greater for <b>isoxepac</b> than for indomethacin. The objectives {{of this study were}} to compare the anti-inflammatory activity of <b>isoxepac</b> 200 mg three times daily with aspirin 1200 mg three times daily, and to compare the adverse effects of the two treatments.
