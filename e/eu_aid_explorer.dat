40|$|Over {{the years}} <b>EU</b> <b>aid</b> {{has been much}} {{discussed}} - and criticized. Besides the accusations of being old fashioned, slow and bureaucratic {{there is also the}} complexity of a close neighbourship with the EU's foreign policy in general, trade and the eternal question for Europe of what to do as a community, and what to do as individual member states. This study cuts through this discussion by simply asking what works and why. Based on a somewhat exclusive version of participant observation the author describes the features that are distinct for <b>EU</b> <b>aid</b> and arrives at the conclusion, that thanks to a reform effort that mainstreamed <b>EU</b> <b>aid</b> these distinct features have become key assets...|$|R

50|$|Some {{criticism}} of gender equality development aid discusses {{a lack of}} voices of women’s organizations in developing aid programs. Debusscher argued that feminist and women’s organizations were not represented enough in <b>EU</b> <b>aid.</b> and that while feminist and women’s organizations were represented in implementing policy programs they were not sufficiently involved in their development in <b>EU</b> <b>aid</b> to Southern Africa. Similarly, Jones and Swiss argue that more women {{need to be in}} leadership positions of aid organizations and that these organizations need to be “demasculinized” in order to better gender mainstream. T.K.S. Ravindran and A. Kelkar-Khambete criticized the Millennium Development Goals for insufficiently integrating gender into all development goals, instead creating its own development goal, as limiting the level of aid provided to promote gender equality.|$|R
50|$|The <b>EU's</b> <b>aid</b> has {{previously}} been criticised by the think-tank Open Europe for being inefficient, mis-targeted and linked to economic objectives. Furthermore, some charities have claimed European governments have inflated the amount they have spent on aid by incorrectly including money spent on debt relief, foreign students, and refugees. Under the de-inflated figures, the EU did not reach its internal aid target in 2006 and the EU would not reach the international target of 0.7% of GNP until 2015. However, only a few countries have reached that target. In 2005 <b>EU</b> <b>aid</b> was 0.34% of the GNP, which was {{higher than that of}} the United States and Japan. The ex commissioner for aid, Louis Michel, has called for aid to be delivered more rapidly, to greater effect, and on humanitarian principles.|$|R

5000|$|After {{the fall}} of the Albanian {{communist}} regime in 1991, relations between Greece and Albania became increasingly strained because of widespread allegations of mistreatment by Albanian authorities of the Greek ethnic minority in southern Albania and of the Albanian communities in northern Greece. A wave of Albanian illegal economic migrants to Greece exacerbated tensions. The crisis in Greek-Albanian relations reached its peak in late August 1994, when an Albanian court sentenced five members (a sixth member was added later) of the ethnic Greek political party Omonia to prison terms on charges of undermining the Albanian state. Greece responded by freezing all <b>EU</b> <b>aid</b> to Albania, and sealing its border with Albania. In December 1994, however, Greece began to permit limited <b>EU</b> <b>aid</b> to Albania, while Albania released two of the Omonia defendants and reduced the sentences of the remaining four.|$|R

40|$|There {{is a rich}} body of theorizing on the {{diffusion}} of democracy across space and time. There is also an emerging scholarship on authoritarian diffusion. The dynamics {{of the interaction between}} external democratic and autocratic diffusion processes and their effects on national and sub-national political regime outcomes have received scant attention in the literature. Do democratic diffusion processes help counter external authoritarian influences? And, in contexts where external diffusion of democratic influences is weak, do we observe greater susceptibility to diffusion from regional autocracies that might in turn reinforce authoritarian practices and institutions in “recipient” states? To address these questions, we perform analysis of data from two original under-utilized data sets—a data set on the European Union (<b>EU)</b> <b>aid</b> to Russia’s regions and a data set with statistics on trade among post-Soviet states. We find that <b>EU</b> <b>aid</b> has the effect of countering external authoritarian influences that work through Soviet-era inter-regional economic ties...|$|R

40|$|Research on aid is {{continuously}} exploring new {{channels to}} measure its effectiveness on economic development. The Millennium Development Goals {{have set the}} standard for aid policy-making and now, when facing deadline, its partakers have to set a new aid policy-agenda. The European Union is the largest donor of official development assistance (ODA), contributing a total of 50 - 60 percent of world ODA. Still the EU struggles with finding conclusive evidence of the effectiveness of aid. In the light of the above, this paper provides a panel data regression analysis of whether <b>EU</b> <b>aid</b> shows any short-term effect on foreign direct investments in developing countries and if so, if it is possible to distinguish what kind of <b>EU</b> <b>aid</b> is most effective in doing so. ODA is subcategorized into three target sectors: economic infrastructure, production sectors and social infrastructure. The study takes its stand from FDI- and aid theory, relative developing countries and {{in the light of the}} EU.

40|$|From introduction] The European Union now realises that {{developing}} countries are affected by {{more than just the}} <b>EU’s</b> <b>aid</b> policies. Trade, agriculture, environment, migration and many other policies have an impact, but it seems difficult to take these into account when decisions are being made in these domains. In a nutshell, this summarises the debate on policy coherence for development (PCD), a key concept in the EU’s Consensus on Development, the leading policy document in this field...|$|R

The meeting welcomed the opening of trade negotiations and called for support to regional economic integration so as to create a favourable climate for trade and investment to diversify production in ACP countries. The meeting also highlighted the complexities and difficulties in accessing <b>EU</b> <b>aid,</b> and called on their governments to ensure the immediate and widest possible application of the provisions earmarked for direct civil society support measures. Comment: In emphasising the importance of trade liberalisation in terms of wider economic and social development and the need for economic diversification in ACP countries, the position of ACP and EU social partners is in line with the views of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly. These highlight the need for support for structural transformation of ACP economies and the need to ensure that processes of trade liberalisation serve wider social and economic goals. The comments on the accessibility of <b>EU</b> <b>aid</b> highlight the importance of the call of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to review existing arrangements.

50|$|Tensions {{increased}} when on 20 May 1994 the Albanian Government took into custody {{five members of}} the ethnic Greek advocacy organization Omonoia on the charge of high treason, accusing them of secessionist activities and illegal possession of weapons (a sixth member was added later). Sentences of six to eight years were handed down. The accusations, {{the manner in which the}} trial was conducted and its outcome were strongly criticized by Greece as well as international organizations. Greece responded by freezing all <b>EU</b> <b>aid</b> to Albania, sealing its border with Albania, and between August-November 1994, expellingover 115,000 illegal Albanian immigrants, a figure quoted in the US Department of State Human Rights Report and given to the American authorities by their Greek counterpart. Tensions increased even further when the Albanian government drafted a law requiring the head of the Orthodox Church in Albania be born in Albania, which would force the then head of the church, the Greek Archbishop Anastasios of Albania from his post. In December 1994, however, Greece began to permit limited <b>EU</b> <b>aid</b> to Albania as a gesture of goodwill, while Albania released two of the Omonoia defendants and reduced the sentences of the remaining four. In 1995, the remaining defendants were released on suspended sentences.|$|R

40|$|<b>EU</b> State <b>aid</b> law {{has sought}} to enable people with disabilities to obtain employment, yet has not been {{explicitly}} included in the toolbox of policy options to improve the availability and choice of accessible technology within the EU Internal market. This {{seems to be the}} consequence of an inherent bias against State intervention in the market, which is mostly unwelcome since it can limit open and free competition. This also reiterates the ‘less-aid’ policy and the purely economic approach to State aid professed by the European Commission. Against this background, this article discusses the potential for <b>EU</b> State <b>aid</b> policy to foster both ‘design for all’ and innovative assistive devices for people with disabilities. It seeks to argue that the goal of an EU-wide market of accessible technology can be achieved using <b>EU</b> State <b>aid</b> law. In particular, this article aims to highlight that a more targeted use of <b>EU</b> State <b>aid</b> law can lead developers to increase the production of accessible goods, to adjust or reduce prices and to provide consumers with a greater degree of choice in a greater number of marketplaces. Whilst it adopts a legal approach, this analysis relies inter alia on economic evidence and recalls the pamphlet recently published by Mazzuccato, from which the title of this work has drawn inspiration...|$|R
