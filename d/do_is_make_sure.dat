30|$|Legal {{regulations}} for RC should {{bridge the gap}} between (eco-)toxicological data generated by experts and risk perceptions of non-experts. Ideally, products posing no risks would not require any RC process. Yet, as long as PCPs pose a residual risk, the legal requirements should be adequate to ensure that consumers are informed and are able to understand the information provided in order to make informed choices. RC is the process through which individuals are informed about potential hazards and risks for risk mitigation decision making and management, often with the intention of provoking safety behaviors [3, 45 – 48]. The process of communicating risks is not static, nor are there universally agreed upon approaches. Over the past 25  years, RC has evolved in developed countries as RC practitioners continued to identify more effective strategies. In 1995, Fischhoff listed these stages, each building on the former, as (1) all practitioners needed to <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the statistics <b>were</b> right, (2) all practitioners needed to <b>do</b> <b>was</b> present the statistics, (3) all practitioners needed to <b>do</b> <b>was</b> explain what the statistics meant, (4) all practitioners needed to <b>do</b> <b>was</b> show that similar risks had previously been accepted, (5) all practitioners needed to <b>do</b> <b>was</b> illustrate that the risk is good for those exposed, (6) all practitioners needed was to treat those exposed nicely, (7) all practitioners need to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>make</b> those exposed to the risk partners, and (8) all practitioners need to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> incorporate all of the above stages [49, 50]. The more recent literature on RC indicates that it should be a two-way process - that is, a process that involves consultation with and participation by the general public/consumers [3, 46]. This could be seen as falling under Fischhoff’s seventh stage. In developing and low-middle-income countries like SA, however, the RC process has not evolved and tends to be at Fischhoff’s stages 1 and 2 - that is, risks are communicated through a top-down approach (one-way communication), or risk information is just presented (i.e. listed on the label) [46]. In the EU, the recognition of consultation and participation is referred to in several documents rather than implemented in practice. This is particularly the case with PCP labels and results in the EU paying lip service to Fischhoff’s stage 7. The reality is that two-way RC is costly and time consuming. Thus, the challenge is to move from policy to practice in order to protect consumers.|$|R
