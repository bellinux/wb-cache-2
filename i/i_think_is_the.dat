500|$|... "What You Want" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Terry Balsamo, and Tim McCord in New York City and the {{production}} was handled by Nick Raskulinecz. During an interview with MTV News in June, Lee talked about the song saying, [...] " [...] the song that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first single is the song that wraps it all up. It's got a cool meaning, {{a lot of great}} lyrics going on, it also just smacks you right in the face and it's heavy and it's great." [...] She noted that the song was a departure from the band's previous material and acknowledged that they wanted the new single to be [...] "more than a hit".|$|E
500|$|Several {{members of}} the cast of Voyager found the episode enjoyable. Mulgrew praised [...] "Elogium" [...] for her {{opportunity}} {{to interact with the}} Kes character on a maternal level. [...] Mulgrew thought the episode was a great vessel for Lien to stretch her acting chops, calling her [...] "a constant and wonderful surprise." [...] Lien herself thought that the episode was a great vehicle to learn more about her character and the Ocampa species; she said [...] "t really took my character to a different level." [...] Russ thought that [...] "Elogium" [...] (along with [...] "Emanations") were stories that challenged concepts, ideas, attitudes, and traditions—all things that Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry originally wrote science fiction about: [...] "That, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most important part of Star Trek." [...] Director Winrich Kolbe praised Lien's performance in [...] "Elogium", but was disappointed that he could not take the character even further, saying that [...] "he show went soft at the end." [...] Kolbe complained that it wasn't uncommon for a wonderful concept to fall victim to a failing of courage and determination.|$|E
500|$|Local {{favourite}} Sergio Pérez, who {{had been}} on a one-stop strategy, said after the race that it had been the safety car period that [...] "destroyed" [...] his chances at a better result, but added: [...] "What I could do, I did perfectly, so I'm happy with that." [...] His teammate Nico Hülkenberg had finished the race in front of him, and said after the race: [...] "The Safety Car ended up playing into my hands, which is the little bit of luck you always need to get a good result". Speaking about the race, 14th-placed Jenson Button said: [...] "Painful, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> word. I was on the harder tyre at the start but still it was just waving goodbye to everyone in front really." [...] He also stated that he believed that McLaren were more affected by the high altitude than the other teams. On his one-lap outing, Fernando Alonso explained that the problem that caused his retirement had been discovered the night before. He added: [...] "We had two possibilities, retire the car without even starting the race or try our maximum, knowing that maybe one or two laps was the maximum we could achieve [...] We did one lap, for respect of the fans because they were amazing all weekend." ...|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} in August 2012, several days after choosing Ryan as his running mate, Romney said, [...] "Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same, if not identical -- it's probably close to identical." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 28 August 2006, {{the founder}} of the Australian Democrats, Don Chipp, died.

2500|$|When {{he retired}} in December 2004, the AP News Service quoted Moyers as saying, [...] "I'm going out telling the story that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> biggest story of our time: how the right-wing media has become a {{partisan}} propaganda arm of the Republican National Committee. We have an ideological press that's interested in the election of Republicans, and a mainstream press that's interested in the bottom line. Therefore, we don't have a vigilant, independent press whose interest is the American people." ...|$|E

60|$|This action, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{only one}} {{that looked like a}} defeat given the enemy at this siege. We killed them near 300 men, as I have said, and lost about sixty of our troopers.|$|R
60|$|Then Quilla and {{the lady}} Mira came forward and, placing their hands beneath my elbows, {{assisted}} me {{to climb out of}} that balsa, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> strangest way that ever a shipwrecked wanderer came to land.|$|R
2500|$|Now {{where is}} the {{understanding}} in this system? It takes Chinese as input, it simulates the formal structure of the synapses of the Chinese brain, and it gives Chinese as output. But the man certainly doesn't understand Chinese, and neither do the water pipes, {{and if we are}} tempted to adopt what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> absurd view that somehow the conjunction of man and water pipes understands, remember that in principle the man can internalize the formal structure of the water pipes and do all the [...] "neuron firings" [...] in his imagination.|$|E
2500|$|Gregory {{was among}} those who {{identified}} Mary Magdalene with Mary of Bethany, whom [...] recounts as having anointed Jesus with precious ointment, an event that some interpret as being the same as the anointing of Jesus performed by a woman that Luke (alone among the synoptic Gospels) recounts as sinful. Preaching on the passage in the Gospel of Luke, Gregory remarked: [...] "This woman, whom Luke calls a sinner and John calls Mary, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Mary from whom Mark reports that seven demons were cast out." [...] Today Biblical scholars distinguish the three figures, but they are all still popularly identified.|$|E
2500|$|This most {{eccentric}} and haunting {{of modern}} epics {{is driven by}} oilman Daniel Plainview, who, {{in the hands of}} actor Daniel Day-Lewis, becomes a Horatio Alger story gone horribly wrong. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's camera is as crucial to the films hypnotic pull as the performance at its center. For its evocation of the early 1900s, its relentless focus on one man's fascinating obsessions, and for its inspiring example of how to freely adapt a novel—plus, what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> performance of the new century—There Will Be Blood stands alone. The more I see it, the sadder, and stranger, and more visually astounding it grows—and the more it seems to say about the best and worst in the American ethos of rugged individualism. Awfully good! ...|$|E
60|$|This, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most of {{the news}} I got from my friend Loudon; and I hope I was well inspired, and have put all the {{questions}} to which you would be curious to hear an answer.|$|R

6000|$|... "In my time," [...] said he, [...] "I {{have seen}} many {{attempts}} to change an inconvenient topic. Some have been artful; others artless; others utterly clumsy.
