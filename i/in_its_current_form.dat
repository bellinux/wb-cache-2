5|$|Archimedes' Book of Lemmas or Liber Assumptorum is a {{treatise}} with fifteen propositions on {{the nature}} of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in Arabic. The scholars T. L. Heath and Marshall Clagett argued that it cannot have been written by Archimedes <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form,</b> since it quotes Archimedes, suggesting modification by another author. The Lemmas may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost.|$|E

5|$|On August 24–25, 1814, in a raid {{known as}} the Burning of Washington, British forces invaded the capital during the War of 1812.

5|$|The {{core of the}} I Ching is a Western Zhou divination text {{called the}} Changes of Zhou (周易 Zhōu yì). Various modern {{scholars}} suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form. Based on {{a comparison of the}} language of the Zhou yi with dated bronze inscriptions, the American sinologist Edward Shaughnessy dated its compilation <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> to {{the early decades of the}} reign of King Xuan of Zhou, in the last quarter of the 9th century BC. A copy of the text in the Shanghai Museum corpus of bamboo and wooden slips (recovered in 1994) shows that the Zhou yi was used throughout all levels of Chinese society <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> by 300 BC, but still contained small variations as late as the Warring States period. It is possible that other divination systems existed at this time; the Rites of Zhou name two other such systems, the Lianshan and the Guizang.|$|E

5|$|Appearing on a {{document}} of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has {{a picture of}} a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk with the book in one hand and three outstretched fingers in the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. By the 19th century the figure was portrayed as youthful and became known as the Münchner Kindl or Munich Child.

5|$|However, a {{shortage}} of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in the project.

In March 2010, the project <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> was officially abandoned, and a PHP5.4 release was prepared containing most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP6, such as traits and closure re-binding.

5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of {{nucleic acid sequences}} from the internal transcribed spacer and elongation factor EF-1α regions suggests that the genus Morchella {{can be divided into}} three lineages. M.rufobrunnea belongs to a lineage that is basal to the esculenta clade ("yellow morels"), and the elata clade ("black morels"). This phylogenetic placement implies that it has existed <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form</b> since the Cretaceous era (roughly 145 to 66 million years ago), and all known morel species evolved from a similar ancestor. M.rufobrunnea is genetically closer to the yellow morels than the black morels. M.anatolica, described from Turkey in 2012, is a closely related sister species.|$|E

5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating calendar, the Maya {{measured}} time from a fixed start point.

This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> <b>form.</b> The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak'tuns. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an exceptional cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.|$|E

As such, in 1961, there was little military interest in the P.1127 program, although, in January 1961, Hawker was requested to provide a quote for the costs involved in a potential 100 production standard P.1127 aircraft. Meanwhile, Hawker believed that the continuing development of the P.1127 would serve a successful demonstration, acting to dissuade potential customers from pursuing competing 'paper' VTOL aircraft projects.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 194 (I-194) is a , north–south freeway between {{downtown}} Battle Creek and I-94 in {{the southern}} portion of the city.

I-194 is the only three-digit spur or loop route off I-94 in the state of Michigan and runs concurrently throughout its length with M-66, which continues both north and south from the termini of I-194.

5|$|Moving {{east from}} the Water Gate, the {{south-eastern}} curtain defences and the south-east bastion were rebuilt {{at the start}} of the 20th century to hold emplacements for four quick-firing guns and two 6-inch (15 cm) guns, with underground tunnels linking to an underground magazine.

Against this backdrop, both community and urban futures are rethought and brought into relation with (i) the emergent discourse of 'sustainment' (named as a moment, project and process) and (ii) the rise of 'redirective practice'.

Route 1011 is the internal designation for Flagstone Road, {{one of the}} two side roads in Pennsylvania along with the bridge.
