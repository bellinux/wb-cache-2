5|$|A {{characteristic}} of Douglas's work is {{his attention to}} both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his <b>joinery,</b> perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building. However, {{in the cases of}} Rowden Abbey and StMichael and All Angels Church, Altcar, the entire buildings were timber-framed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{large numbers}} of bolt holes cut into truck frame side members act as <b>joineries</b> and points of {{attachments}} for various sub systems of the truck. While these bolt holes are unavoidable due to their primary functional importance, the near hole residual stress resulting from the type of hole cutting operation {{plays a significant role}} in deciding the fatigue performance of frame rail structures. If the residual stress is tensile in nature, this along with the surface roughness at the hole surface can lead to early initiation of fatigue cracks around bolt hole surface. In order to assess the extent of plastic deformation and resulting residual stresses in near hole areas of frame bolt holes cut using drilling, punching, laser cutting and water jet cutting processes, experimental investigation was carried out through microstructure analysis and X-ray diffraction measurements. Apart from this, an assessment of shot-peened hole surface was taken up to understand the effect of shot-peening on fatigue behavior of frame rail section with bolt holes. Also the test specimens extracted from frame rail sections were tested for comparing the fatigue life of specimens having bolt holes cut using different hole cutting operations...|$|R
50|$|Pre-assembly of {{the house}} began in January 1953 at Ito's {{workshop}} in Nagoya, and was completed a year later, using the traditional Japanese method of building, which minimizes the use of structural nails, employing various <b>joineries</b> {{through the use of}} hand tools. The house was then disassembled and shipped to New York. The reassembly team led by architect Yoshimura arrived at New York in March, 1954 and completed the construction mid-June with help of a cadre of Hawaiian Nisei carpenters. The inaugural ceremony was held on June 17, 1954 and Shofuso was opened to the public on June 19. Japanese prime minister Shigeru Yoshida visited Shofuso in November 1954, escorted by John D. and Blanchette Rockefeller. The American public was impressed with the beauty of natural wood, simple interior design, and flexible plan. The exhibit was closed on October 16, 1955, after attracting almost a quarter of million visitors in two seasons, approximately three times as many visitors as the two previous MoMA House and Garden exhibits (a 1949 house by architect Marcel Breuer that exists today at Kykuit, the Rockefeller family estate in Pocantico Hills, NY, and a 1950 house by architect Gregory Ain), demolished after the exhibition.|$|R

His architectural styles were eclectic. Douglas worked during the period of the Gothic Revival, and many of his works incorporate elements of the English Gothic style. He was also influenced by architectural styles from the mainland of Europe and included elements of French, German and Dutch architecture. However he is probably best remembered for his incorporation of vernacular elements in his buildings, in particular half-timbering, influenced by the black-and-white revival in Chester. Other vernacular elements he incorporated include tile-hanging, pargeting, and the use of decorative brick in diapering and the design of tall chimney stacks. Of particular importance is Douglas's use of <b>joinery</b> and highly detailed wood carving.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess {{properties}} of lesser used/known timbers from Mozambique. The studied species were ncurri (Icuria dunensis Wieringa), ntholo (Pseudolachnostylis maprounaefolia Pax), metil (Sterculia appendiculata K. Schum), namuno (Acacia nigrescens Oliv.) and muanga (Pericopsis angolensis Meeuwen). A comprehensive literature review found the Mozambique timber sector to be dominated by very few hardwood species while the rest of 118 lesser used wood species are almost unexplored. The above mentioned lesser used timbers were selected and subjected to descriptive and comparative analyses aiming at describing the physical-mechanical properties and natural durability with regard to prospective end uses. Standard test methods determined density, moisture content, dimensional stability characteristics, colour, natural durability and a number of mechanical properties of the selected lesser used timbers. The study revealed that ntholo and ncurri are heavy timbers with a density in the range of 850 - 1100 kg/m 3 and very low dimensional changes. Metil is a medium light wood with an average density of 550 kg/m 3 at 12 % moisture content and a coefficient of anisotropy of 1. 8 from green to oven-dry state. End use assessments suggest that the timbers of ntholo, muanga and namuno can be used in similar applications as the well known timbers, e. g. internal <b>joineries,</b> tool handles and furniture. Metil timber seems suitable for packaging boxes, plywood and construction purposes. In terms of natural durability, the results showed that heartwood of namuno, muanga and ntholo can be classified as very durable to deterioration and degradation caused by fungi and termites. These timbers showed good performance when untreated samples were exposed in- and above ground field tests providing a good indication of the expected service life and outdoor use features. Wood of metil was classified as non durable to any of the considered hazards and is not recommended for exterior uses unless treated with appropriate wood preservatives. The study determined ntholo timber mechanical properties and examined interrelationships with density and anatomical features of ntholo through regression and correlation analyses. The study found ntholo to be a very dense timber with high mechanical strength in comparison to well known timbers. The regression analyses show that both ntholo sapwood and heartwood densities are poor predictors for the tested mechanical properties, although may provide some indication of tested properties. All tested properties of ntholo sapwood were influenced mainly by ground tissue proportions, while heartwood properties were described by more leveled anatomical predictors. Fiber length was the only anatomical feature significantly correlated to density and all tested mechanical properties of ntholo. The number of vessels/mm 2 and % vessels were not significantly correlated to any of the measured properties but appeared to be key anatomical features for predictions under regression analysis. The integrated analysis of results from this study is expected to form a reliable background for a successful utilization of the relatively lesser explored timbers from Mozambique...|$|R
40|$|Current {{building}} legislation (NZS 4218 : 2009) includes {{requirements for}} energy efficient windows. This {{has resulted in}} most new homes in New Zealand being fitted with double glazed windows, improving the health, comfort and environmental efficiency of these buildings. Yet, {{a large number of}} the existing (older) homes built before the legislation, more than one million homes, have not adopted the new technology meaning most people are living in cold, mouldy and unhealthy homes across the country. This suggests barriers to the uptake of double glazed windows (DGW) in existing homes. Therefore, this research seeks to identify and discuss the challenges faced by homeowners and other stakeholders in retrofitting double glazed windows in older homes in New Zealand. The focus of this research is to analyse the data collected and evaluate the findings with information from the literature and provide recommendations to help deal with the challenges in retrofitting DGW. These recommendations can make retrofitting DGW more accessible to homeowners resulting in healthier and more comfortable homes as well as helping to protect the environment. In order to accomplish the purpose and objectives of this research, this study employed the unstructured interview as a data collection method with a qualitative approach. A total of 12 participants from homeowners and industry professionals related to the retrofitting of double glazed windows in older homes were interviewed in New Zealand. Based on the empirical results, the study found a number of challenges in retrofitting double glazed windows. The main challenges are attributed to its high cost, lack of information, perceived low return on investment (ROI), difficulty in accessing trades people, uncertainty and length of time frame as well as complexity of regulation. The benefits such as comfort, health and safety and helping to address environment issues and the insignificant economic gains are not enough drive for most homeowners to retrofit their homes with DGW. Furthermore, homeowners find {{that it is difficult to}} access information and knowledge associated with retrofitting. It was found that based on the current understanding of benefits and environmental issues, major factors identified as challenges, there is only limited interest demonstrated by most homeowners in retrofitting their existing homes with DGW. This research provides recommendations that could increase the interest of homeowners in retrofitting their homes with DGW. Firstly, regulation could be introduced as a motivating driver to retrofit DGW in older homes. Secondly, stakeholders should also create a knowledge platform with detailed information on retrofitting DGW such as technology, cost, time frame, process, health, comfort and environmental issues. Thirdly, DGW with vacuum technology should be used as it can match SGW in terms of weight and thickness, retrofitted into existing <b>joineries,</b> saving retrofitting cost, time and possibly avoiding the lengthy and costly Council consent. Finally, the government should provide funding in their long term budget that could be utilised during an economic crisis to help owners retrofit DGW in their homes to help stabilise the ‘boom and bust’ economic cycles in the New Zealand construction sector. Overall, the study shows multifaceted difficulties associated with retrofitting DGW including high cost, relatively low knowledge, low return on investment, uncertainty on the length of time frame as well as accessing trades people. These issues have driven down the homeowners’ interest level in retrofitting DGW in their homes. Therefore, future research should be conducted to increase homeowners’ interest by establishing an accurate cost for retrofitting DGW, expanding on the literature to establish a strong knowledge platform that is easily accessible by the consumers. In addition, New Zealanders should learn and collaborate with a country such as Japan that has successfully implemented retrofitting their homes with DGW and enjoyed the gains from doing so...|$|R
40|$|The {{harvesting}} of Mozambique tropical hardwood {{species is}} considerable {{higher than the}} natural regrowth in the forest and the stock is decreasing drastically. Therefore, {{it is important to}} improve the material recovery when the wood is refined (i. e., in sawing and further refinement to products such as <b>joineries,</b> furniture etc.) to reduce the waste and to re-utilize efficiently the by-products to increase the added value. The wood processing industry is an important means to boost the industries in the rural areas and also to generate incomes for the local communities by creating jobs and business opportunities. The majority of the logging {{that can be used for}} sawmilling in Mozambique is exported as roundwood due to the inability of companies to meet the product standards set for export and to generate profit. The lack of capabilities of the local sawmills to generate profit, also foments the illegal logging because of the higher price of roundwood for export which contributes to increase the number of unlicensed individuals in harvesting. This threatens the law enforcement and thus the degradation of the local wood industry. An alternative to increase the profit and empower the local community could be to export more refined wood products such as sawn timber, parquet, and veneer instead of the roundwood. The objective of the work was to investigate alternative sawing strategies of tropical hardwood species that could increase the profitability of the Mozambique wood industry in general and at sawmill in particular. The subject was approached using a database of virtual logs and together with a sawing simulator. The thesis has two main focus areas: (1) creating the log database with the corresponding algorithms for sawing simulation, and (2) investigations of alternative sawing strategies. The first focus was to build the database of surface-scanned logs and develop the algorithm for the saw simulation. The results are a database of 15 logs models describing the logs outer shape in which 10 jambirre (Millettia stuhlmannii Taub.) and 5 umbila (Pterocarpus angolensis DC.), and the algorithm for the sawing simulation. The algorithm use “brute force” i. e., determines all volume yields of sawn timber from the combination of all settings of log-positioning parameters (offset, skew and rotation) and selects the maximum value of volume yield. From simulation, using three sawing patterns (cant-sawing, through-and-through sawing and square-sawing) combined with two positioning parameters (offset and rotation) it was found that the sawing pattern has great impact on volume yield and that the square-sawing gave higher yield followed by through-and-through sawing pattern. The second focus was on alternative sawing strategies; having in mind that the optimal volume yield is achieved by aid of computerized production systems and that these resources are not yet in use in Mozambique. Hence, the objective was to find the positioning parameters that can be set manually and improve the volume yield. The result have shown that the rotation is the most affecting parameter followed by offset and skew, and that the volume yield can decrease by between 7. 7 % and 12. 5 % from the optimal positioning when the logs are manually positioned with the knowledge about the optimal log position. In another study, using crook-up or horns-down positioning as alternative to the optimal positioning, the volume yield decreases by between 10 % and 13 % from the optimal positioning. By using bucked logs, the optimal volume yield increased by between 8 % and 13 % in relation to full lengths logs, and the volume yield of bucked logs when using crook up positioning decreases 2 % in relation to optimal positioning of full length logs. It is concluded that there is an unexploited value potential in the wood chain which can be reached using alternative positioning and modern measurement techniques and that the grading of wood will facilitate and improve the sawing process...|$|R
