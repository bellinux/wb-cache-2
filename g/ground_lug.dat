50|$|If a {{power outage}} occurs on {{system with a}} weak backup battery it can cause the alarm to trigger. Preventing this type of false alarm {{requires}} alarm owner to periodically replace the backup battery.Most people should have surge suppression on the AC power {{as well as the}} RJ31X area. If properly installed, the surges should bypass the system. So to help prevent a feedback loop up case ground, never install the RJ31X surge suppression inside the burglar alarm panel, and only ground it to the <b>ground</b> <b>lug</b> of the AC surge suppression. To even reduce more false alarms, tie three to four knots in the phone line between the RJ31X Surge suppression and the panel as well as three to four knots in the low voltage AC power source feeding the panel after the AC surge suppression.|$|E

Why I {{remember}} when old timers like Tommy Gibbons, Mike O'Dowd and Billy Miske {{used to run}} for hours {{in any kind of}} weather to strengthen their underpinning and lungs. They would get up {{early in the morning and}} ride the street car as far out of St. Paul as they could and then they'd run every step of the way back to the gym. And listen cold weather never bothered those men. On the zero days they'd put on enough clothes to sag these modern fighters to the <b>ground</b> and <b>lug</b> that extra weigh all the way home. Those men were great fighters and were always in condition and long lived in the game. Being in condition and staying that way means everything. These present day boxers - phooey."- Mike McNulty on July 30, 1935 ...|$|R
