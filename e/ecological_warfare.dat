50|$|Jensen co-wrote {{the book}} Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet with Lierre Keith and Aric McBay. Jensen's {{contribution}} consists of end-of-chapter responses to common queries he gets regarding bringing down civilization. The {{bulk of the}} book is written by the other two authors and covers the history of effective militant resistance movements such as parts of the U.S. civil rights movement and the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), while also outlining potential strategies for above- and below-ground resistance to civilization, termed Decisive <b>Ecological</b> <b>Warfare.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Mesopotamian Marshes in {{southern}} Iraq were historically the largest wetland ecosystem of Western Eurasia. Their drainage {{began in the}} 1950s, to reclaim land for agriculture and oil exploration. Saddam Hussein extended this work in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as part of <b>ecological</b> <b>warfare</b> against the Marsh Arabs, a rebellious {{group of people in}} Baathist Iraq. However, with the breaching of the dikes by local communities after the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the ending of a four-year drought that same year, the process has been reversed and the marshes have experienced a substantial rate of recovery. The permanent wetlands now cover more than 50% of pre-1970s levels, with a remarkable regrowth of the Hammar and Hawizeh Marshes and some recovery of the Central Marshes.|$|E
40|$|This article charts a media {{historical}} {{relation between}} radiation and celluloid film, {{ranging from the}} downwind 1956 production of The Conqueror to early scientific imaging practices, war photography, war documentaries, military industrial film, and contemporary artists working on radiation aesthetics. Posing the collection as a diagnostic media ecology, this article argues that the valuable evidence provided by the environmental metadata stored in celluloid film {{is the product of}} <b>ecological</b> <b>warfare</b> and violence. By turning to the material sciences for {{a better understanding of how}} nuclear weapons affect media on large spatial and temporal scales we gain a parallax view to how photographic practices – defined as the aesthetic exchange of light and energy – occur autonomously within our ecology, although some of these forces are mobilised in deadly and imperceptible ways. By demonstrating that non-human agencies released by Cold War energy policies have contaminated military industrial and commercial film archives alike, this article asserts that nuclear testing and warfare have contributed to a global condition of test-subjectivity that can be evidenced by diagnostic media ecology...|$|E
