2500|$|Case 1. A {{girl had}} 2 {{seizures}} in sleep at 6 years of age. In the <b>first</b> <b>fit</b> {{she was found}} vomiting vigorously, eyes turned to one side, pale, and unresponsive. Her condition remained unchanged for 3 hours before she developed generalized tonic-clonic convulsions. She gradually improved, and {{by the next morning}} was normal. The second seizure occurred 4 months later. She awoke and told her mother that she wanted to vomit, and then vomited. Within minutes her eyes turned to the right. Her mother, who was on her left, asked, [...] "Where am I?" [...] "There, there," [...] the child replied, indicating to the right. Ten minutes later {{she closed her eyes and}} became unresponsive. Generalized convulsions occurred 1 hour from onset. Thereafter she recovered quickly. Her EEGs showed occipital paroxysms, but this normalized by the age of 10 years. [...] The patient had in childhood infrequent vasovagal syncopes and/or syncope-like epileptic seizures. [...] At last communication with her, she was 29 years of age and following a successful professional career.|$|E
2500|$|Ronaldo was {{the last}} Brazilian player {{out of the tunnel}} as the teams entered the field. During the playing of the Brazil {{national}} anthem the camera focused on him throughout, with Ronaldo showing little emotion. Steinberg states that Ronaldo [...] "sleepwalked" [...] through the final in what was a below par performance for the striker, which also saw him injured in a collision with French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Zagallo admitted the fears over Ronaldo affected his team psychologically, and stated [...] "for the whole of the first half I was wondering whether to take him off", but feared a public outcry in Brazil had he done so. Brazil lost the match to hosts France 3–0. Ronaldo later reflected: [...] "We lost the World Cup but I won another cup - my life." [...] An inquest was launched in Brazil, with team doctor Lídio Toledo telling the commission [...] "imagine if I stopped Ronaldo playing and Brazil lost. At that moment I'd have to go and live on the North Pole." [...] Adrian Williams, professor of clinical neurology at Birmingham University, said that Ronaldo should not have played, saying that he would have been feeling the after effects of the seizure and that [...] "there is no way that he {{would have been able to}} perform to the best of his ability within 24 hours of his <b>first</b> <b>fit</b> – if it was his first fit." [...] Despite his sub-par performance in the final due to his seizure hours earlier, Ronaldo was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament for his performances leading up to the final, and finished the tournament as the joint-third highest scorer.|$|E

60|$|Her {{voice was}} so loud and her {{appearance}} so alarming that the unfortunate Maudie, emitting three piercing shrieks, rose hastily {{from the table and}} looked around for a way of escape. The road to the front-door was barred, and with a final yelp that set her employer's teeth on edge she dashed into the yard and went home via the back-fences. Housewives busy in their kitchens looked up in amazement at the spectacle of a pair of thin black legs descending one fence, scudding across the yard to the accompaniment of a terrified moaning, and scrambling madly over the other. At her own back-door Maudie collapsed on the step, and, to the intense discomfort and annoyance of her father, had her <b>first</b> <b>fit</b> of hysterics.|$|E

The personal element in the magnetic attraction exercised by this circumambient, unapproachable master of hers was so much stronger than the intellectual and abstract that she could not understand it. To be sure, she was surrounded noon and night by his customary environment, which literally whispered of him to her at every moment; but he was a man she had never seen, and that all that moved her was the instinct to specialize a waiting emotion on the <b>first</b> <b>fit</b> thing that came to hand did not, of course, suggest itself to Ella.|$|E

60|$|Andrew {{rose and}} took his companion's arm. He {{scarcely}} glanced again towards Duncombe, who followed {{them out of the}} room. And there in the hall awaiting them was the young lady from Vienna, quietly dressed in black, but unmistakable with her pretty hair and perfumes. Duncombe watched them shake hands and move away before he could recover sufficiently from his <b>first</b> <b>fit</b> of surprise to intervene. Then a realization of what had happened rushed in upon him. They, too, then, had been to the Café Montmartre, with their obvious Anglicisms, their clumsy inquiries--to make of themselves without doubt the jest of that little nest of intriguers, and afterwards their tool. Duncombe thought of the fruits of his own inquiries there, and shivered. He hurried after the little party, who were apparently {{on their way to the}} café.|$|E
60|$|Everybody in {{the full}} tide {{of the eighteenth century}} had {{something}} to do with Voltaire, from serious personages like Frederick the Great and Turgot, down to the sorriest poetaster who sent his verses to be corrected or bepraised. Rousseau's debt to him in the days of his unformed youth we have already seen, as well as the courtesies with which they approached one another, when Richelieu employed the struggling musician to make some modifications in the great man's unconsidered court-piece. Neither of them then dreamed that their two names were destined to form the great literary antithesis of the century. In the ten years that elapsed between their first interchange of letters and their <b>first</b> <b>fit</b> of coldness, it must have been tolerably clear to either of them, if either of them gave thought to the matter, that their dissidence was increasing and likely to increase. Their methods were different, their training different, their points of view different, and above all these things, their temperaments were different by a whole heaven's breadth.|$|E
60|$|This recalls another instance, {{still more}} illustrative of the knotted, trebly intertwisted villainy, accumulating at {{a sort of}} {{compound}} interest in a man-of-war. The cockswain of the Commodore's barge takes his crew apart, one by one, and cautiously sounds them as to their fidelity--not to the United States of America, but to himself. Three individuals, whom he deems doubtful--that is, faithful to the United States of America--he procures to be discharged from the barge, and men of his own selection are substituted; for he is always an influential character, this cockswain of the Commodore's barge. Previous to this, however, he has seen to it well, that no Temperance men--that is, sailors who do not draw their government ration of grog, but take the money for it--he has seen to it, {{that none of these}} balkers are numbered among his crew. Having now proved his men, he divulges his plan to the assembled body; a solemn oath of secrecy is obtained, and he waits the <b>first</b> <b>fit</b> opportunity to carry into execution his nefarious designs.|$|E

6000|$|What had {{hitherto}} {{been the}} result of this the reader knows,--and Tregear knew also. He had taken the privilege given to him, and had made so complete a use of it that he had in truth transferred his heart as well as his allegiance. Where is the young man who cannot do so;--how few are there who do not do so when their <b>first</b> <b>fit</b> of passion has come on them at one-and-twenty? And he had thought that she would do the same. But gradually he found that she had not done so, did not do so, could not do so! When she first heard of Lady Mary she had not reprimanded him,--but she could not keep herself from showing the bitterness of her disappointment. Though she would still boast of her own strength and of her own purpose, yet it was too clear to him that she was wounded and very sore. She would have liked him to remain single at any rate till she herself were married. But the permission had been hardly given before he availed himself of it. And then he talked to her not only of the brilliancy of his prospects,--which she could have forgiven,--but of his love--his love! ...|$|E
60|$|Tony, {{before the}} evening was over, gave the Boyle {{officers}} two or three most desperate bargains. First, he got the celebrated mare Kickie-wickie {{for a pair of}} broken down gig horses, to run tandem: engaged to go quiet and not kick in harness. They couldn't be warranted sound: but then, as Tony said, what horse could? and he was so particular--he would never say a horse was sound, unless he knew it; in fact, he never warranted a horse sound; which was true enough, for Tony knew no one would take his warrant; and then when the Captain was in the <b>first</b> <b>fit</b> of grief for Kickie-wickie, some good-natured friend having told him that the two gig horses weren't worth a feed of oats, Tony gave her back again for a good hack hunter, and a sum of money to boot, about the real value of the mare. Again, late in the evening--when the punch had made further inroads upon the poor warrior's brain--he gave him back his own hunter for the two gig horses and a further sum of money: from all which it will be seen by those who understand the art, that the officer from Boyle could not have made a great deal, and that Tony McKeon could not be much out of pocket.|$|E
60|$|Gillian meantime, {{after her}} <b>first</b> <b>fit</b> of sick longing for {{her brother and}} sister, and sense of disappointment, was finding some {{consolation}} in the reflection that had Jasper discovered her instructions to Alexis White, he would certainly have 'made no end of a row about it,' and have laughed to scorn the bare notion of her teaching Greek to a counting-house clerk! But then Jasper was wont to grumble and chafe at all employments---especially beneficent ones---that interfered with devotion to his lordly self, and on the whole, perhaps he was safer out of the way, as he might have set on the aunts {{to put a stop}} to her proceedings. Of Mysie's sympathy she was sure, yet she would have her scruples about the aunts, and she was a sturdy person, hard to answer---poor Mysie, whooping away helplessly in the schoolroom at Rotherwood! Gillian felt herself heroically good-humoured and resigned. Moreover, here was the Indian letter so long looked for, likely by its date to be an answer to the information as to Alexis White's studies. Behold, it did not appear to touch on the subject at all! It was all about preparations for the double wedding, written in scraps by different hands, at different times, evidently snatched from many avocations and much interruption. Of mamma there was really least of all; but squeezed into a corner, scarcely legible, Gillian read, 'As to lessons, if At. J. approves.' It was evidently an afterthought; and Gillian could, and chose to refer it to a certain inquiry about learning the violin, which had never been answered---for the confusion that reigned at Columbo was plainly unfavourable to attending to minute details in home letters.|$|E

5000|$|Two of {{the most}} common methods for {{wavelength}} assignment are <b>First</b> <b>Fit</b> and Random Fit. <b>First</b> <b>Fit</b> chooses the available wavelength with the lowest index.

5000|$|An {{extension}} to <b>First</b> <b>Fit</b> and Random Fit was proposed in [...] to consider signal quality.
