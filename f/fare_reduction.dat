25|$|Over {{the coming}} years, Silver City pursued {{a policy of}} {{continuous}} fare reductions to fill the additional capacity on its growing air ferry network. This included new car ferry services between Southampton (Eastleigh) and Cherbourg {{as well as between}} Southend (Rochford) and Ostend and a DC-3 passenger service linking Gatwick and Le Touquet. Both of the former commenced in spring 1952, while the latter was inaugurated the following year. As a result, the number of vehicles carried doubled from 5,000 to 10,000 between 1950 and 1952 and quadrupled to 40,000 {{by the end of the}} following year.

25|$|By January 2016, average {{ridership}} slumped {{further to}} 1,967 passengers per day. Fares were reduced on March 9, 2016 to $12 for a one-way trip between Union and Pearson, or $9 with a Presto card. On {{the first day}} of reduced fares, staff counted 5,300 boardings with 40 per cent of the riders being first-time UPX users, 83 per cent being air travelers and 17 per cent being commuters. By June 2016, the daily average ridership had risen to 7,657, and a new record was set on July 29, when the service carried more than 11,000 passengers. However, the <b>fare</b> <b>reduction</b> has lowered the total revenue collected by the UP Express, which is expected to be below what is required for its operating costs. It was revealed that since opening day to March 2016, the UP Express' provincial operating subsidy totaled $39.3 million or about $52.26 per ride.|$|E

After 16 months of commencement of operations, the line was shut down for repairs of the viaducts on 8 July 2012. [...] The line reopened on 22 January 2013. On 27 June 2013 Reliance Infrastructure Ltd intimated DMRC that {{they are unable to}} operate the line beyond 30 June 2013. Following this DMRC took over operations of Airport Express line from 1 July 2013 with an Operations and Maintenance team of 100 officials to handle the line. In Jan 2015, DMRC reported that Airport Metro has recorded about 30 per cent rise in its ridership following the <b>fare</b> <b>reduction</b> of up to 40 per cent in July last year On 14 September 2015 DMRC announced to reduce fares even further to improve the ridership of the line, the new fare structure will have maximum fare of ₹60 and minimum of ₹10 instead of ₹100 and ₹20 charged earlier, a reduction of about 40%. DMRC has stated that this was done to reduce the crowding on Blue line, diverting some of the Dwarka-bound passengers to Airport Express Line, which is underutilised and faster compared to the Blue Line.|$|E

40|$|Southwest Airlines is {{frequently}} credited with having an important {{influence on the}} success of airline deregulation in the United States. This paper uses an original set of competition variables to estimate the extent of that influence in 1998. The estimated savings - due to actual, adjacent, and potential competition from Southwest - were $ 12. 9 billion. Southwest's low fares were directly responsible for $ 3. 4 billion of these savings to passengers. The remaining $ 9. 5 billion represents the effect that actual, adjacent, and potential competition from Southwest had on other carriers' fares. These savings amount to 20 per cent of the airline industry's 1998 domestic scheduled passenger revenue and slightly more than half the <b>fare</b> <b>reductions</b> attributed to airline deregulation. From a policy perspective, these results are both troubling and encouraging. On the one hand, it is troubling to find that {{a large part of the}} <b>fare</b> <b>reductions</b> from airline deregulation is due to one carrier. On the other hand, if entry by a carrier with the appropriate characteristics can make such a difference, policies that encourage entry - for example, relaxing the restriction on entry by foreign-owned carriers - may have a large impact on passenger welfare. ?

30|$|Maximum fares for the {{regulated}} regional flights have been adjusted {{according to the}} Norwegian Consumer Price Index. Deregulation of the commercial part of the Norwegian air transport market in 1994 resulted in a market situation characterized by [11] as competition with respect to capacity on flights between the large airports. However, the entry into the commercial air transport market of the low cost carrier ‘Norwegian Air Shuttle’ in 2002 provided increased domestic competition and considerable <b>fare</b> <b>reductions</b> for the main routes. Hence, fares have moved in opposite directions for regulated and commercial flights [10].

Analysis based on these elasticity values tends to understate the potential of transit <b>fare</b> <b>reductions</b> and service improvements to reduce problems, such as traffic congestion and vehicle pollution, and understates the long-term negative impacts that fare increases and service cuts will have on transit ridership, transit revenue, traffic congestion, and pollution emissions...|$|R
