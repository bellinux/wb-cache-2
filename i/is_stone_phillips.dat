2500|$|The Colbert Report premiered in October 2005. The {{first guest}} <b>was</b> <b>Stone</b> <b>Phillips,</b> a partial {{influence}} on the character. In the debut episode, Colbert coined the word truthiness, defined as [...] "a quality characterizing a [...] "truth" [...] that a person making an argument or assertion claims to know intuitively [...] "from the gut" [...] or because it [...] "feels right" [...] without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or facts." [...] was named Word of the Year for 2005 by the American Dialect Society and for 2006 by Merriam-Webster. The character's forceful nature confused some in the program's early days. During an appearance on the segment [...] "Better Know a District" [...] in the show's first season, a frustrated Barney Frank declined to continue, deeming the conversation too dumb. In one early episode, the Colbert character purported to be {{a former member of}} a 1980s new wave group, Stephen & the Colberts, and released a fictional music video from the band for the song [...] "Charlene (I'm Right Behind You)".|$|R

5000|$|Zamora <b>was</b> {{interviewed by}} <b>Stone</b> <b>Phillips</b> on Dateline {{in a show}} {{broadcast}} in April 2007. Her appeals were exhausted, and with her lawyer's permission she took a polygraph test administered by Dateline. Her story was now that Graham {{and she had been}} breaking up, and that Graham was using the murder to [...] "tie her to him". She noted that she obstructed justice by cleaning the car afterwards and was an accessory after the fact; however, Zamora pointed out that the jury had convicted her of intending to kill Jones, which she denied. When she took the polygraph, the administrator repeatedly told her to stop her exaggerated breathing, a counter-measure for such tests. He said that he believed he had enough to actually say that Zamora had failed the crucial question on whether she had intended to kill Jones. Two other independent polygraph administrators, who were not at the test, were contacted by Dateline and asked to review the results; they said that they could offer no opinion due to counter-measures. Zamora responded to Phillips that she was nervous and hyperventilating despite being told all the questions in advance and reviewing them with the administrator before the test.|$|R

50|$|Phillips {{ended his}} twelve-year {{relationship}} with ABC in 1992, joining NBC News {{to serve as}} co-anchor with Jane Pauley on Dateline NBC.

Among them was the first network interview with Lynndie England, the U.S. Army soldier, about her role in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. Others included notorious serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and Bernhard Goetz (a man who shot four black teenagers in the New York City Subway).

50|$|In 2001, the Monster case made {{headlines}} again. Michele Giuttari, chief inspector {{for the police}} unit GIDES (Investigative Group for Serial Crimes) announced that the crimes were connected to a satanic cult allegedly active in the Florence area. This conclusion was based, in part, on {{the discovery of a}} pyramidal stone near a villa where suspect Pietro Pacciani had <b>been</b> employed. The <b>stone,</b> Giuttari suggested, <b>was</b> indicative of cult activity. Critics, such as journalist Mario Spezi, found this idea laughable, given that such <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> commonly used as doorstops in the surrounding area. For Giuttari and Giuliano Mignini, it was possible that a pharmacist, Francesco Calamandrei, was involved, but he was then exonerated. It was possible that a physician from Perugia, who may had committed suicide in a lake the same year as the last murder, named Francesco Narducci was the killer. The truth to these claims have never been confirmed. In their 2008 non-fiction book The Monster of Florence, Douglas Preston and Mario Spezi suggested the same perpetrator that Nabb had identified: Antonio Vinci (the nephew and son of two Sardinian brothers each suspected of being the Monster) as a likely candidate for being the real killer. Vinci denied this in a Dateline NBC interview with <b>Stone</b> <b>Phillips.</b> Because of this book, prosecutor Mignini arrested Spezi for misdirection and defamation, but the journalist was acquitted of all the later charges.|$|R
5|$|At the {{national}} convention of 1856, Stone presented {{a new strategy}} suggested by Antoinette Brown Blackwell to send a memorial to the various state legislatures signed by the officers of the National Woman’s Rights Convention. Antoinette Brown had married Samuel Charles Blackwell on January 24, 1856, becoming Stone's sister-in-law in the process. Stone, Brown Blackwell and Ernestine Rose were appointed a committee {{to carry out the}} plan. Stone drafted and printed the appeal, and Brown Blackwell mailed it to twenty-five state legislatures. Indiana and Pennsylvania referred the memorial to select committees, while both Massachusetts and Maine granted hearings. On March 6, 1857, <b>Stone,</b> Wendell <b>Phillips</b> and James Freeman Clarke addressed the Judiciary Committee of the Massachusetts senate, and on March 10, <b>Stone</b> and <b>Phillips</b> addressed a select committee of the Maine legislature.|$|R

50|$|Dateline is {{historically}} notable for its longevity on the network. The program debuted on March 31, 1992, initially airing only on Tuesdays, with <b>Stone</b> <b>Phillips</b> and Jane Pauley serving as its co-anchors. Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric joined the program when the previously separate newsmagazine Now with Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric was converted into Dateline Wednesday. Gradually, the program expanded {{with the addition}} of a third night (on Friday) in 1994 and a fourth night (on Monday) in 1997, peaking at five nights of airings each week (eventually adding a Sunday edition) in mid-1999 and 2000. The number of nights that the program aired on began to be reduced with the rise of equally-economic and popular reality television programming and the result of viewer exhaustion with the multiple-night format. Editions first began to be removed in the spring of 2001, with the main Tuesday slot being eliminated in 2003.|$|R

[...] O'Reilly's use of [...] "talking points" [...] — illustrated onscreen graphics reflecting the host's opinions — are parodied on The Colbert Report with the segment [...] "The Word".
