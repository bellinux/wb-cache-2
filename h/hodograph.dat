40|$|Vertical {{wind shear}} {{parameters}} are presented for 60 left-moving supercells across the United States, 53 of which produced severe hail ($ 1. 9 cm). <b>Hodographs</b> corresponding to environments of left-moving supercells {{have a tendency}} to be more linear than those of their right-moving supercell counterparts. When curvature is present in the <b>hodographs</b> of the left-moving supercells, it is typically confined to the lowest 0. 5 – 1 km. Values of 0 – 6 -km wind shear for left-moving supercells—both bulk and cumulative—are within the ranges commonly found in right-moving supercell environments, but the shear values do occur toward {{the lower end of the}} spectrum. Conversely, the absolute values of storm-relative helicity (SRH) for left-moving supercells are much smaller, on average, than what occur for right-moving supercells (although SRH values for many right-moving supercells also fall well below general guidelines for mesocyclone development). A significant fraction of the 0 – 3 -km SRH (25 %) and 0 – 1 -km SRH (65 %) for left-moving supercells is positive, owing to the shallow clockwise curvature of the <b>hodographs.</b> However, nearly all of the 1 – 3 -km SRH for left-moving supercells is negative, with absolute values comparable in magnitude to those for right-moving supercells. A limited climatological analysis of vertical wind shear associated with convective environments across parts of the central United States suggests that clockwise curvature of the low-level shear vector is most common in the central/southern plains, partially explaining the preeminence of right-moving supercells in that area. In contrast, <b>hodographs</b> are more linear over the northern high plains, suggesting left-moving supercells may be relatively more common there. It would be beneficial to implement operational radar algorithms that can detect mesoanticyclones across the United States. 1...|$|R

ABSTRACT: In the {{presented}} {{paper the}} basic {{assumptions of the}} algorithm and program of seismic ray trajectories and travel times modelling are described for the case of reflected PP, SS and PS waves in the discrete anisotropic (transversely isotropic) medium with tilted symmetry axis. The ray trajectories and travel times in the discrete horizontally layered medium (VTI) and in the monoclinally dipping layers are defined {{by means of the}} numerical solution of the partial equations set resulting from the Fermat principle. The values of the velocities and Thomsen anisotropy parameters are defined in the nodes of the assumed, two dimensional grid.

40|$|Abstract. The Ekman-Taylor {{problem for}} the {{planetary}} boundary layer is solved {{in the case of}} a thermal wind which varies linearly with height. The upper boundary condition is a vanishing a-geostrophic wind, while the lower boundary condition is continuity of the stress vector across the interface between the planetary boundary layer and the surface layer. The latter condition is used to determine the magnitude and the direction of the wind at the bottom of the Ekman layer. Theoretical <b>hodographs</b> are compared with observed <b>hodographs</b> based on five years of ohserva-tions from Ship N in the Pacific, giving fair agreement. The divergence, the vorticity, and the vertical velocity are calculated through the Ekman layer with emphasis on differences between the classical barotropic and the baroclinic cases; these differences are significant, especially in the vertical velocities as compared to the standard approximation. An extension of the present study to include thermal stratification is desirable. 1...|$|R

50|$|Hodographs shapes {{are rarely}} a {{straight}} line, however some are {{close enough to}} the idealized example that mirror image splits will appear in radar imagery. In most cases however, there is usually a slight curvature in the <b>hodograph,</b> which tends to favor one split over the other. Take for example a <b>hodograph</b> that carves out a shallow right curve. Both crosswise and streamwise vorticity are present in this environment. As with the idealized environment crosswise vorticity lines are tilted into the vertical on the flanks of this updraft. Once the pressure perturbations initiate new updrafts on the flanks and they begin to rotate as a result of stretching and ingestion of newly experienced streamwise vorticity. The right split, having propagated even farther right to the <b>hodograph,</b> has increased the magnitude of positive SRH ingestion. This will serve to increase the rotation in the updraft, intensifying the pressure perturbation, strengthening the storm. On the other hand, the left mover, rotating anticyclonically, is struggling to maintain its updraft since it is ingesting positive environmental SRH. In this case, the left split will tend to weaken, as the right split becomes dominant.|$|E
