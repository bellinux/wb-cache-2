50|$|Die {{castings}} {{and permanent}} mold castings commonly contain internal porosity. This porosity is generally localized to the deepest cross-sections {{of the part}} and does not extend to the outer skin. However, if the part is also machined, the internal porosity will be exposed and the part will leak if pressurized. Machined die castings that need to hold <b>fluids</b> (<b>intake</b> manifolds, coolant connectors, transmission cases, pump housings and fluid power components) are routinely sealed for life using acrylic resins. Because the sealant is internal to the part, the exterior dimensions and appearance of the part are unchanged.|$|R
5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral <b>fluid</b> <b>intake</b> is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E

Cause of bowel impairments in MS patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of defecation. The former is commonly related to inmobility or secondary effects from drugs used {{in the treatment of}} the disease. Pain or problems with defecation can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased <b>fluid</b> <b>intake,</b> oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control the problems.|$|E
5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, {{the emphasis}} is on treating this with diuretics to reduce the circulating blood volume, restriction of salt and <b>fluid</b> <b>intake,</b> and antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart beat. This may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of swelling and breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. Embolization treatment has been attempted, but leads to severe complications in a proportion of patients and is discouraged.|$|E

40|$|Background: Water-loss {{dehydration}} {{in older}} people {{is associated with}} increased mortality and disability. We aimed to assess the prevalence of dehydration in older people living in UK long-term care, and associated cognitive, functional and health characteristics. Methods: The Dehydration Recognition In our Elders (DRIE) cohort study included people ≥ 65 years living in long-term care without heart or renal failure. In a cross-sectional baseline analysis we assessed serum osmolality, previously suggested dehydration risk factors, general health, markers of continence, cognitive and functional health, nutrition status and medications. Univariate linear regression {{was used to assess}} relationships between participant characteristics and serum osmolality, then associated characteristics entered into stepwise backwards multivariate linear regression. Results: DRIE included 188 residents (mean age 86 years, 66 % women) of whom 20 % were dehydrated (serum osmolality > 300 mOsm/kg). Linear and logistic regression suggested that renal, cognitive and diabetic status were consistently associated with serum osmolality and odds of dehydration, while potassium-sparing diuretics, sex, number of recent health contacts, and bladder incontinence were sometimes associated. Thirst was not associated with hydration status. Conclusions: DRIE found high prevalence of dehydration in older people living in UK long-term care, reinforcing the proposed association between cognitive and renal function and hydration. Dehydration is associated with increased mortality and disability in older people, but trials to assess effects of interventions to support healthy <b>fluid</b> <b>intakes</b> in older people living in residential care are needed to enable us to formally assess causal direction and any health benefits of increasing <b>fluid</b> <b>intakes...</b>|$|R
5|$|Seals {{typically}} consume {{their prey}} underwater {{where it is}} swallowed whole. Prey that is too large or awkward is taken to the surface to be torn apart. The leopard seal, a prolific predator of penguins, is known to violently swing its prey back and forth until it is decapitated. The elaborately cusped teeth of filter-feeding species, such as crabeater seals, allow them to remove water before they swallow their planktonic food. The walrus is unique in that it consumes its prey by suction feeding, using its tongue to suck the meat of a bivalve out of the shell. While pinnipeds mostly hunt in the water, South American sea lions are known to chase down penguins on land. Some species may swallow stones or pebbles for reasons not understood. Though they can drink seawater, pinnipeds get most of their <b>fluid</b> <b>intake</b> from the food they eat.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} and compare energy, protein, non-starch polysaccharide, and <b>fluid</b> <b>intakes</b> of a care home population consuming a texture modified diet (TMD) with those {{on a standard}} diet and also to evaluate the role of snacks in individuals' diets. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Care homes. Participants: Thirty residents (n = 15 requiring standard diet: n = 15 requiring TMD). Measurements: Dietary intakes were assessed using a 3 -day weighed plate-wastage method. All snacks and drinks consumed were observed and recorded. Weights of standard portions and volumes {{were used to determine}} actual amounts consumed of these items. Estimated intakes were converted to energy and nutrient intakes using WinDiets Dietary analysis software. Results: Residents on a TMD had significantly lower intakes of energy (1312 [326] kcal versus 1569 [260] kcal, P <. 024), non-starch polysaccharide (6. 3 [1. 7] g versus 8. 3 [2. 7] g, P <. 02) and fluid (1196 [288] mL versus 1611 [362] mL, P <. 002) when compared with residents on a standard texture diet. Snacks provided significantly less energy (13 % or 173 kcal versus 22 % or 343 kcal, P =. 001) and non-starch polysaccharide (P <. 001) in those requiring the TMD. Conclusions: These results suggest that dietary and <b>fluid</b> <b>intakes</b> of older adults in care homes requiring a TMD are significantly less than individuals on a standard texture diet. These are unlikely to be meeting individuals' dietary and nutritional needs. Strategies that maximize provision of appetizing energy and nutrient-dense foods (including snacks) and fluids of suitable textures require further investigation. © 2011 American Medical Directors Association...|$|R

30|$|The {{clinical}} conundrum can thereafter be restated as follows: what is {{the mechanism}} that drives the secretion of AVP? Assessment of ECFV {{is of paramount importance}} and may provide meaningful insights to that question. It should include a gross appreciation of the total body sodium stores and sources of hypotonic <b>fluids</b> <b>intake,</b> including of iatrogenic origin. Most of all it should allow for the discrimination of 3 subsets of patients with decreased, increased or normal ECFV. In patients with decreased ECFV, AVP production is directly induced by the hemodynamic stimulus resulting from “true hypovolemia”. As for patients with increased ECFV, a category largely dominated by conditions related to heart failure or cirrhosis, “effective hypovolemia” provides the grounds for increased AVP secretion. Finally, in euvolemic patients, AVP secretion is unconnected to its usual physiological triggers.|$|R

40|$|Background: Water {{consumption}} {{as a vital}} {{component of}} the human diet is under-researched in dietary surveys and nutrition studies. Aim: To assess total water and <b>fluid</b> <b>intakes</b> and examine demographic, anthropometric, and dietary factors associated with water consumption in the Australian population. Methods: Dietary intake data from the 2011 to 2012 National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey were used. Usual water, fluid and food and nutrient intakes were estimated from two days of dietary recalls. Total water includes plain drinking water and moisture from all food and beverage sources; total fluids include plain drinking water and other beverages, but not food moisture. Results: The mean (SD) daily total water intakes for children and adolescents aged 2 – 18 years were 1. 7 (0. 6) L for males and 1. 5 (0. 4) L for females, and for adults aged 19 years and over were 2. 6 (0. 9) L for males and 2. 3 (0. 7) L for females. The {{majority of the population}} failed to meet the Adequate Intake (AI) values for total water intake (82 %) and total <b>fluids</b> <b>intake</b> (78 %) with the elderly at highest risk (90 %– 95 %). The contributions of plain drinking water, other beverages and food moisture to total water intake were 44 %, 27 %, and 29 %, respectively, among children and adolescents, and 37 %, 37 % and 25 % among adults. The main sources of other beverages were full-fat plain milk and regular soft drinks for children and adolescents, and tea, coffee, and alcoholic drinks for adults. For adults, higher total water intake was associated with lower percent energy from fat, saturated fat, and free sugars, lower sodium and energy-dense nutrient poor food intakes but higher dietary fibre, fruit, vegetable, caffeine, and alcohol intakes.

2500|$|Dehydration refers both to hypohydration ({{dehydration}} induced {{prior to}} exercise) and to exercise-induced dehydration (dehydration that develops during exercise). The latter reduces aerobic endurance performance {{and results in}} increased body temperature, heart rate, perceived exertion, and possibly increased reliance on carbohydrate as a fuel source. Although {{the negative effects of}} exercise-induced dehydration on exercise performance were clearly demonstrated in the 1940s, athletes continued to believe for years thereafter that <b>fluid</b> <b>intake</b> was not beneficial. More recently, negative effects on performance have been demonstrated with modest (<2%) dehydration, and these effects are exacerbated when the exercise is performed in a hot environment. The effects of hypohydration may vary, depending on whether it is induced through diuretics or sauna exposure, which substantially reduce plasma volume, or prior exercise, which has much less impact on plasma volume. Hypohydration reduces aerobic endurance, but its effects on muscle strength and endurance are not consistent and require further study. [...] Intense prolonged exercise produces metabolic waste heat, and this is removed by sweat-based thermoregulation. A male marathon runner loses each hour around 0.83 L in cool weather and 1.2 L in warm (losses in females are about 68 to 73% lower). People doing heavy exercise may lose two and half times as much fluid in sweat as urine. This can have profound physiological effects. Cycling for 2 hours in the heat (35nbsp&°C) with minimal <b>fluid</b> <b>intake</b> causes body mass decline by 3 to 5%, blood volume likewise by 3 to 6%, body temperature to rise constantly, and in comparison with proper <b>fluid</b> <b>intake,</b> higher heart rates, lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs, reduced skin blood flow, and higher systemic vascular resistance. These effects are largely eliminated by replacing 50 to 80% of the fluid lost in sweat.|$|E

40|$|In {{many parts}} of Australia the climate is such that people are working long hours in the heat. Consequences of {{excessive}} environmental heat stress range from reduction in safety due to impairment of concentration, to heat illness, which in extreme cases can be fatal. A critical factor in tolerance of workers to environmental heat stress is their level of hydration. Maximising productivity without compromising {{the health and safety}} of the work force requires quantification of the degree of stress posed by the thermal environment. For this purpose a number of heat stress indices have been developed. A recently introduced index is the Thermal Work Limit (TWL), which has been widely adopted and implemented in the underground mining industry in Australia. The field use of TWL and protocols in the mining industry with resultant reduction in heat illness and lost production is a practical endorsement of the index, and its validity under controlled conditions has been confirmed by a preliminary study. The further work needed to complete this validation forms part of this thesis. TWL was found to reliably predict the limiting workload in the controlled environment, reinforcing the validity of the algorithm and its application in the workplace. To date TWL has largely been used in the underground environment, however as the algorithm is equally applicable to the above ground environment where radiant heat forms a significant component of the thermal load, field studies were carried out at mining installations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia to evaluate this application of the index. The current industry standard index of heat stress is the Wet bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT). The shortcomings of this index are widely acknowledged and in practice it is frequently ignored as it is seen to be unnecessarily conservative in many situations. The sensitivity of TWL to the cooling effect of air movement implied that TWL would be more relevant than WBGT as a predictor of the impact of environmental heat stress in outdoor work environments and this was supported by the results. On the strength of this, recommended management protocols linked to TWL similar to those already in place in many underground workplaces, were developed for the management of thermal risk in outdoor work environments. Maintaining adequate hydration is the single most important strategy to counteract the effects of thermal stress. No heat stress index can protect workers from the combined effects of dehydration and thermal stress. To document the hydration status of the outdoor workforce in the Pilbara, the hydration level of groups of workers was assessed from the specific gravity of their urine. To further evaluate whether the fluid replacement behaviour of the workers is adequate to replace fluids lost in sweat, a fluid balance study was carried out to quantify average <b>fluid</b> <b>intakes</b> and sweat <b>fluid</b> losses. The majority of workers were found to be inadequately hydrated at the start of the shift and their <b>fluid</b> <b>intakes</b> were in general well below the requirements to replace sweat losses - let alone improve hydration. Recommendations for <b>fluid</b> <b>intakes</b> based on documented rates of sweat loss are included in the thesis.
