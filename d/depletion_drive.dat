The virgin reservoir may be entirely liquid, but {{will be expected to}} have gaseous hydrocarbons in solution due to the pressure.

This gas cap pushes down on the liquid helping to maintain pressure.|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of the {{variability}} of theoretical and effective CO 2 storage capacity estimation within depleted gas reservoirs {{is dependent on the}} integrated analysis of reservoir structure, aquifer performance and thermodynamic behaviour. Four published theoretical CO 2 storage capacity methods and one effective method have been used to estimate the capacity and variability of two Triassic <b>depletion</b> <b>drive</b> reservoirs and two Triassic water drive reservoirs located within the UK Southern North Sea and East Irish Sea Basin. Input parameters to the storage capacity equations have shown a degree of natural variability whereas others are more accurately constrained. As such, {{attempts have been made to}} more accurately constrain the most variable input parameters. The geometric, petrophysical and production characteristics of the reservoirs are analysed. Material balance methods are used to assess the reservoir drive mechanism of the reservoirs. If reservoirs are found to experience a water drive, the aquifer strength is estimated. The gas compressibility factor, gas formation volume factor and CO 2 density is estimated under initial reservoir temperature conditions using six equations of state for comparison of results. These results are then input to storage capacity equations producing a range of estimates. The most susceptible parameter to variability was the cumulative volume of water influx to a reservoir, We. Variability was also found to be the result of error in estimation of the original gas in place. As such, the water drive reservoirs made further use of aquifer modelling to achieve more precise estimates of OGIP and We. The effective capacity coefficients for the various reservoirs have been estimated to assess the proportion of pore space available for CO 2 storage. The effective CO 2 storage capacity constitutes a fraction of the theoretical CO 2 storage capacity which ranges between 0 (no storage possible) and 1 (all theoretically accessible pore volume is occupied by CO 2). Overall, it was found that <b>depletion</b> <b>drive</b> reservoirs have the potential to store greater volumes of CO 2 than water drive reservoirs whose aquifer waters occupy the newly liberated pore space. ...|$|E
30|$|Enhanced oil {{recovery}} (EOR) {{is a method}} of recovering hydrocarbon where the compressional energy of the reservoir is used to force oil to the producer wells, with a drop-in reservoir pressure. It is, therefore, a process that recovers oil that was not originally produced from the reservoir. Hydrocarbon recovery occurs through three stages; primary recovery, secondary recovery and tertiary recovery. Primary recovery occurs when the reservoir uses its natural energy to force the oil to the well bore, and it is usually {{referred to as the}} initial production stage. There are six driving mechanisms that produce this natural energy for {{oil recovery}}. They include gas cap drive, combination drive, rock and liquid expansion drive, water drive, gravity drainage drive and <b>depletion</b> <b>drive.</b> Rock properties, fluid properties, and geological heterogeneities influence primary recovery. Primary recovery can recover from zero to over 50 % of the original oil in place (OOIP); this depends on the hydrocarbon type and the reservoir drive mechanism. For instance, the primary recovery from oil sands is zero, whereas the recovery from a water drive and light oil reservoir can reach up to 50 % or more in an effective gravity driven reservoir (Farouq-Ali and Thomas 1996).|$|E

40|$|By {{analytically}} solving {{some simple}} models of phase-ordering kinetics, we suggest {{a mechanism for}} the onset of non-equilibrium behaviour in colloid-polymer mixtures. These mixtures can function as models of atomic systems; their physics therefore impinges on many areas of thermodynamics and phase-ordering. An exact solution is found for the motion of a single, planar interface separating a growing phase of uniform high density from a supersaturated low density phase, whose diffusive <b>depletion</b> <b>drives</b> the interfacial motion. In addition, an approximate solution is found for the one-dimensional evolution of two interfaces, separated by a slab of a metastable phase at intermediate density.

30|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{upscaling}} in reservoir simulation is to capture the dynamic behavior of fine scale models at the coarse scale. Traditional static or dynamic methods use assumptions about the boundary conditions to determine the upscaled properties. In this paper, we show that the upscaled properties are strongly dependent on the flow process observed at the fine scale. We use a simple no-crossflow <b>depletion</b> <b>drive</b> process and demonstrate that an upscaled property is not a constant value. Instead, {{if the goal is}} to match the performance of the fine scale model, the upscaled permeability changes with time. We provide an analytical solution to determine the upscaled permeability and present the value of upscaled permeability under limiting conditions. Our equation suggests that it is possible that upscaled value can fall outside the range of fine scale values under certain conditions. We show that for pseudo steady state flow, using common averaging methods like arithmetic or even geometric averaging methods can lead to optimistic results. We also show that the no-crossflow solution is significantly different than crossflow solution at late times. We validate our method by comparing the results of the method with flow simulation results in two and multi-layered models.|$|E

We {{introduce the}} lock and key colloid, and describe {{how it can be}} useful probe for exploring a specific, geometry-centric, type of colloidal self-assembly called the depletion interaction. We illustrate some of the problems with simulating the lock and key colloid, and intro duce a novel simulation method to side-step many of these problems. Using this simulation technique, and derived theoretical thermodynamic apparatus, we show a methodology for parametrising the <b>depletion</b> <b>drive</b> self-assembly of colloids. This parametrisation allows us to avoid explicitly modelling the nanoparticles that mediate depletion-driven self-assembly and thereby speeds up any subsequent simulations by an order of magnitude compared to the novel simulation technique. Using our parametrisation, we repeat some measurements of explicitly modelled lock and key simulations and find good agreement. As a small aside, we also simulate a sedimenting, lock-only system in the same spirit as a published work. In this work, the authors find an interesting decrystallisation over time from a solid to liquid-like phase. We do not observe this in our experiment but instead note that we can induce a liquid-solid phase transition by varying the depth of the lock mouth.

40|$|Depleted gas {{reservoirs}} {{are potential}} sites for CO 2 storage; therefore, {{it is important}} to evaluate their storage capacity. Historically, there have been difficulties in identifying the reservoir drive mechanism of gas reservoirs using traditional P/z plots, having direct impacts for the estimation of the original gas in place (OGIP) and dependent parameters for both theoretical and effective CO 2 storage capacity estimation. Cole plots have previously provided an alternative method of characterization, being derived from the gas material balance equation. We use production data to evaluate the reservoir drive mechanism in four depleted gas reservoirs (Hewett Lower Bunter, Hewett Upper Bunter, and North and South Morecambe) on the UK Continental Shelf. Cole plots suggest that the North Morecambe and Hewett Upper Bunter reservoirs experience moderate water drive. Accounting for cumulative water influx into these reservoirs, the OGIP decreases by up to 20 % compared with estimates from P/z plots. The revised OGIP values increase recovery factors within these reservoirs; hence, geometrically based theoretical storage capacity estimates for the North Morecambe and Hewett Upper Bunter reservoirs increase by 4 and 30 %, respectively. Material balance approaches yield more conservative estimates. Effective storage capacity estimates are between 64 and 86 % of theoretical estimates within the <b>depletion</b> <b>drive</b> reservoirs, and are 53 [*]–[*] 79 % within the water drive reservoirs...|$|E

40|$|Gas {{condensate}} reservoirs {{are generally}} recovered using a pressure <b>depletion</b> <b>drive.</b> Gas can condensate into the liquid phase near the wellbore region when the reservoir pressure falls below {{the dew point}} pressure, which can kill gas deliverability. Wettability alteration is {{an effective means of}} overcoming this problem; core wettability can be altered from liquid-wet to gas-wet to alleviate the effect of condensate accumulation near the wellbore region. To establish the effect of fluoropolymer on wettability alteration in a gas-condensate reservoir, a gas-wetting alteration agent was synthesized by emulsion polymerization using different molar ratios of fluorine-containing monomers and acrylic monomers. FTIR and SEM were performed to analyze the structure of the gas-wetting agent. Contact angle measurements were used to assess surface alteration by the Owens two-liquid method. The effects of alteration agent concentration, salt concentration, pH and temperature on gas-wetting alteration were also evaluated. Results showed that the best molar ratio of fluoropolymer monomer to acrylic monomers was 1 : 2. The egg-like structure of the fluoropolymer latex on the core surface mainly contributes to gas-wetting alteration. The contact angles of brine and oil can be altered from 23 ° and 0 ° to 137 ° and 67 ° by 1 wt% FP- 2 treatment, respectively.

40|$|This is {{the first}} study to compare plasma {{depletion}} drifts with the ambient plasma drifts and neutral winds in the post sunset equatorial ionosphere using global-scale satellite observations. The local time and latitude variations of the drift velocities of O+ plasma depletions at 350 – 400 ?km altitude are derived from the observations of the far ultraviolet imager operated on the IMAGE satellite during 10 March to 7 June 2002. These depletion drift velocities are compared with the simultaneously measured ion drift velocities and neutral winds by the ROCSAT- 1 and the CHAMP satellites for a similar time period. The analysis shows that the zonal drift velocity of plasma depletions is smaller than both the ambient ion zonal drift velocity and the neutral zonal wind at 18 : 00 – 20 : 00 magnetic local time, and after 21 : 00, the variations of these velocities are similar. The difference of the plasma depletion drift with the background {{is found to be}} smaller at lower latitudes. Furthermore, the zonal drift velocity of the depletion is found to have a large latitudinal gradient specifically at 12 °– 18 ° magnetic latitude, which again does not match the ambient ion drift and the neutral wind. This latitudinal difference has been reported by previous studies, but those studies use models and they only compare the depletion drifts with the modeled neutral winds. This study provides a measure of the difference that has never been studied before by any study using global observations. It has been suggested that polarization electric fields inside the plasma depletion structure drive the plasma to drift westward and thus the depletion structure moves to the east. The latitudinal gradient of the depletion drift velocity seen here in this study could also be explained by the polarization electric fields. For the C-shaped (reversed C) depletion, the polarization electric fields inside the <b>depletion</b> <b>drive</b> a westward drift of plasma and this drift velocity changes with increasing latitude. Consequently, the depletion drift has a latitudinal gradient becoming significant at higher latitudes. Space EngineeringAerospace Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Today, global {{environmental}} issues, such as {{global warming and}} fossil <b>depletion,</b> <b>drive</b> a paradigm shift in material applications from conventional fossil sources to renewable sources. Following this trend, the topic of this thesis is to analyse the use of biobased resources for fibre reinforced composite fabrication. Currently {{the most widely used}} fibre reinforced composites are composed of glass fibre reinforcements and polymeric matrices. In this thesis, the biobased alternative, i. e. flax fibre, {{which is one of the}} most widely used natural fibres, is studied as a glass fibre substitute from an environmental impact point of view. Moreover, a newly emerging biobased polymer, the wheat gluten, is analysed in the study; and it is compared to a conventional polymer and to a commercially available biobased polymer from environmental impact perspective. The main question addressed in this thesis is whether there are general environmental advantages for the use of flax fibres over glass fibres, and for the wheat gluten polymer over petrochemical polymers. Although biobased materials are often perceived to be environmentally friendly, an in-depth analysis is still needed to answer this question. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is considered to be an appropriate tool for environmental impact quantification. The thesis addresses the following research objectives: (i) to deliver life cycle inventory data for the flax fibre and wheat gluten; (ii) to perform LCA studies on flax fibres compared to glass fibres in composite reinforcement applications and on wheat gluten polymer compared to the conventional low density polyethylene (LDPE) and commercially available biobased polymer polylactic acid (PLA); (iii) to conduct an in-depth analysis concerning sensitivity and uncertainty to obtain information on the robustness of the obtained results. As the initial step, a detailed life cycle inventory for flax cultivation in Northern France is documented. Field emissions associated with the nitrogen cycle are estimated both from a process-oriented DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) method and the generic Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method. Since the IPCC method is derived from field measurements at sites with various soil types, climate conditions, and crops, it is subject to relatively large uncertainty. In contrast, the outputs from the DNDC method are believed to be more accurate because this method is constructed based on complex biochemical models from soil science and makes use of site specific data. The comparison of the results lead to the conclusion that the emission factors from the DNDC method and the recommended values from the IPCC method for flax cultivation in Northern France are quite different. The DNDC based emission factor for direct N 2 O emission, which is a strong greenhouse gas, is by a quarter to half lower than the recommended emission factor according to the IPCC method. The DNDC method leads to a reduction of 17 % in the impact category of climate change per kg retted flax straw production in comparison to the level obtained from the IPCC method. Different co-product accounting principles: mass allocation, economic allocation, and system expansion are investigated for the flax fibre extraction process. The impact results per kg flax hackled long fibre show that economic allocation and system expansion lead to similar values, while the mass allocation approach leads to significantly lower values among all impact categories. Furthermore, methods including the statistical fitting, qualitative judgement, and expert-judgement are integrated to parameterise the important inventory data to run a Monte-Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis. In the case of the climate change impact category, the uncertainty levels through the mass allocation, economic allocation, and system expansion are compared for the results. It is found that the system expansion approach implies the highest level of uncertainty due to inclusion of additional external processes, while the mass allocation leads to the lowest uncertainty. The uncertainty level related to economic allocation is significantly higher than the mass allocation, which can be caused by fluctuating prices of flax (co-) products. With a reliable impact assessment on flax fibre production and with the economic allocation method is used, the study further extends to a comparison of flax fibres and glass fibres in composite applications. The Ashby method is used to ensure functionally equivalent designs. A so-called life cycle environmental impact indicator (LEI) has been introduced. Such LEI is derived from the material mass indices illustrated in the Ashy method. The material mass indices contain only material intrinsic properties and are proportional to the product mass while ensuring equal functionality (e. g. stiffness, strength, etc.) for a specified structure and loading type. Then the LEI can be constructed by using unit environmental impact values (e. g. climate change, fossil depletion, and etc.) in production, use, and EoL, and multiplying these with the mass indices. The LEI highlights three important variables severely influencing the outcome of comparative studies based on this indicator method: the replacement ratio, the specific fuel saving (in case of transport applications), and the fibre volume fraction. The first parameter addresses the concern that flax FRPs are likely to fail earlier than conventional FRPs. Therefore, more flax FRP components are needed for the expected lifespan. The specific fuel saving denotes how much fuel can be saved by a certain weight reduction over a total transport distance. Since flax fibres have a much lower density than conventional glass fibres, flax FRPs can facilitate structures with reduced weight. Therefore flax FPRs are likely to contribute to lower fuel consumption rates. The third parameter, the flax volume fraction, influences the mechanical properties of flax FRPs. Constructed on the polypropylene (PP) matrix, two types of flax FRP products: the flax mat-PP (panel) and short flax fibre-PP (strut), produced via compression moulding and injection moulding, respectively, have been evaluated for multiple impact categories using the ReCiPe method for fixed values of the fibre volume fraction and specific fuel reduction. Compared to a 9 kg glass mat-PP with 20 vol% fibre content, with the equal stiffness criterion under bending, the flax mat-PP with 20 vol% leads to a reduced mass design (7. 8 kg). In contrast, with an equal stiffness criterion under tension, the short flax fibre-PP is similarily heavy (9. 2 kg) as the corresponding GFRP (9 kg). The LCA study compared the environmental impact of flax FRPs and GFRPs within Europe in non-transport use (production plus EoL phases) and transport use. Over the production and EoL phases, the flax mat-PP exhibits lower values for most environmental impact categories than its corresponding glass fibre based counterpart. For most categories, the reductions can reach 20 %~ 50 %. In particular, a 23 % reduction in the climate change category and a 24 % reduction in fossil depletion are documented. Moreover, for the impact categories of ozone depletion and human toxicity reductions of up to 70 % can be achieved. On the other hand, replacing the short glass fibre-PP by short flax fibre-PP only results in modest environmental impact reductions in multiple impact categories, including the impact categories of climate change and fossil depletion where only reductions of around 10 % are recorded. Coming to the full life cycle impact, the saved fuel consumption during the use phase could be very significant depending on the lifetime distance travelled. In 14 out of 17 impact categories, lower life cycle impact results can be observed for the flax mat-PP. However, in case of the short flax fibre-PP compared to short glass fibre-PP, the two material systems lead to very similar environmental impact values in multiple categories due to their very similar mass. Subsequently, a consequential life cycle analysis (CLCA) is conducted to capture how overall environmental impact will change when shifting from glass fibres to flax fibres as reinforcements in composite fabrication. With certain assumptions, the marginal flax fibre supply is identified to be a combination of Chinese flax fibre (70 %) and French flax fibre (30 %). Due to inferior cultivars and coal-fired electricity in Chinese flax cultivation, the CLCA study reveals that flax mat-PP has 0. 8 ~ 2 times higher environmental impact values than the glass mat-PP in most environmental impact categories over the production and end-of-life (EoL) phases. For the purpose of providing potential trajectories of marginal flax fibre supply, additional all French fibre, and all Chinese fibre scenarios are also evaluated, formulating the lower and upper boundaries in terms of environmental impact change, respectively. The attributional fibre supply mix scenario is supplied as well. The all French fibre scenario leads to better scores than glass fibre composites in most impact categories; while the break-even mix lies at attributional supply mix scenario since it presents a close eco-profile to that of glass mat-PP. All of these scenarios are useful for policy analysis. Finally, the study quantifies the life cycle impact for wheat gluten based materials. The contribution serves as a base assessment which can feed into the evaluation of any future wheat-gluten based product. The study evaluates wheat gluten based packaging film and compares it with low density polyethylene LDPE and PLA film over the life cycle of these products. Scenarios including extrusion and casting for film production; incineration with energy recovery and composting for end-of-life treatments are evaluated. The comparison offers insight into the environmental benefits of using wheat gluten over conventional plastic film as well as its biobased alternative and identifies its optimal production and disposal methods. For wheat gluten production, the LCA results show that the impacts of the wheat cultivation and gluten drying phase are dominant in the majority of the impact categories in the ReCiPe midpoint assessment method. The LCA results also exhibit that the scenario with wheat gluten film produced by extrusion and incinerated to recover embodied energy is favourable from an environmental perspective. It offers great benefits in climate change and fossil depletion over LDPE film and in 14 impact categories over PLA film. Although wheat gluten film suffers from common problems for biobased materials (e. g. land occupation), the overall environmental performance indicates that wheat gluten represents a promising source for biobased polymer productionTABLE OF CONTENT TABLE OF CONTENT	I LIST OF FIGURES	V LIST OF TABLES	VII LIST OF ABRIVATIONS	IX ABSTRACT	XI SAMENVATTING	XIII CHAPTER 1 GENERAL INTRODUCTION	 1 1. 1.

40|$|International audienceThe {{ubiquitous}} {{protein kinase}} CK 2 {{has been demonstrated}} to be overexpressed {{in a number of}} human tumours. This enzyme is composed of two catalytic α or α' subunits and a dimer of β regulatory subunits whose expression levels are probably implicated in CK 2 regulation. Several recent papers reported that unbalanced expression of CK 2 subunits is sufficient to drive epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a process involved in cancer invasion and metastasis. Herein, through transcriptomic and miRNA analysis together with comparison of cellular properties between wild type and CK 2 β-knock-down MCF 10 A cells, we show that down-regulation of CK 2 β subunit in mammary epithelial cells induces the acquisition of stem cell-like properties associated with perturbed polarity, CD 44 high/CD 24 low antigenic phenotype and the ability to grow under anchorage-independent conditions. These data demonstrate that a CK 2 β level establishes a critical cell fate threshold in the control of epithelial cell plasticity. Thus, this regulatory subunit functions as a nodal protein to maintain an epithelial phenotype and its <b>depletion</b> <b>drives</b> breast cell stemness...|$|R

40|$|Let- 7 miRNAs {{comprise}} one of {{the largest}} and most highly expressed family of miRNAs among vertebrates, and is critical for promoting differentiation, regulating metabolism, inhibiting cellular proliferation, and repressing carcinogenesis in a variety of tissues. The large size of the Let- 7 family of miRNAs has complicated the development of mutant animal models. Here we describe the comprehensive repression of all Let- 7 miRNAs in the intestinal epithelium via low-level tissue-specific expression of the Lin 28 b RNA-binding protein and a conditional knockout of the MirLet 7 c- 2 /Mirlet 7 b locus. This ablation of Let- 7 triggers the development of intestinal adenocarcinomas concomitant with reduced survival. Analysis of both mouse and human intestinal cancer specimens reveals that stem cell markers were significantly associated with loss of Let- 7 miRNA expression, and that a number of Let- 7 targets were elevated, including Hmga 1 and Hmga 2. Functional studies in 3 -D enteroids revealed that Hmga 2 is necessary and sufficient to mediate many characteristics of Let- 7 depletion, namely accelerating cell cycle progression and enhancing a stem cell phenotype. In addition, inactivation of a single Hmga 2 allele in the mouse intestine epithelium significantly represses tumorigenesis driven by Lin 28 b. In aggregate, we conclude that Let- 7 <b>depletion</b> <b>drives</b> a stem cell phenotype and the development of intestinal cancer, primarily via Hmga 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} long-term urban expansion on soil depletion in Emilia-Romagna, an agricultural-specialized region of northern Italy. Using settlement density maps at three points in time (1945, 1971 and 2001) dense and diffused urbanization trends were assessed and correlated with soil quality. Non-urbanized land decreased from 11. 8 % in 1945 to 6. 3 % in 2001. Urbanization dynamics between 1945 and 1971 reflect the increase of dense settlements around pre-existing urban centers. To the contrary, a discontinuous, low- and medium-density urban expansion along the road network and in the most fertile lowland areas was observed between 1971 and 2001. Overall, urbanization consumed soils with progressively higher quality. However, a diverging trend was observed in the two investigated time intervals: soil with high quality was occupied by compact and dense settlements during 1945 – 1971 and by discontinuous, medium- and low-density settlements during 1971 – 2001. These findings document the polarization in areas with low and high soil capital and may reflect disparities in agricultural production and increasing environmental degradation. Moreover, the analysis shows a diverging trend between land and soil consumption patterns suggesting that the edification of pervious land is an unreliable indicator of soil quality depletion. Taken together, {{the results of this}} study illustrate the (increasing) spatial mismatch between agricultural land and high-quality soils as a consequence of urbanization-driven landscape transformations and may inform measures to contain soil <b>depletion</b> <b>driven</b> by economic growth...|$|R

We show that this experimental result {{can be explained by}} the dielectric screening deficiency of the electrostatic potential, which in turn results from the interfacial solvent <b>depletion</b> effect <b>driven</b> by image dipole interactions. We show this by deriving from the microscopic system Hamiltonian a non-mean-field dipolar Poisson-Boltzmann equation. This can account for the interaction of solvent molecules with their electrostatic image resulting from the dielectric discontinuity between the solvent medium and the substrate. The predictions of the extended dipolar Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the differential capacitance are compared with experimental data and good agreement is found without any fitting parameters...|$|R

40|$|In {{their natural}} environments {{microorganisms}} exist predominantly in aggregates and biofilms. The ability of bacteria to form aggregates {{is associated with}} the biosynthesis of polymers such as polysaccharides. In this study the physical mechanisms underlying bacterial aggregation by extracellular polysaccharides are investigated by utilising the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. S. meliloti biosynthesises an extracellular polysaccharide called succinoglycan, which is well characterised in terms of its structure and biosynthesis. A range of previously constructed succinoglycan biosynthesis mutants were screened for altered aggregation. An S. meliloti exoS mutant (a gain of function mutation that results in a constitutively active two component regulator called ExoS) overproduces succinoglycan and has enhanced aggregation compared to the parent strain, Rm 1021. The aggregates settle {{to the bottom of the}} culture vessel resulting in loss of turbidity of the cultures and phase separation. Microscopic observation showed that succinoglycan did not appear to be attached to the aggregates, which formed ordered structures of laterally aligned cells. By addition of purified succinoglycan it was found that the critical concentration of polymer required to induce aggregation and phase separation of the cultures decreased with increasing cell concentration. These observations suggest that aggregation of S. meliloti cultures in the presence of succinoglycan is driven by macromolecular crowding, otherwise known as depletion attraction. <b>Depletion</b> attraction can <b>drive</b> the ordered arrangement and aggregation of colloidal particles in the presence of polymers. Aggregation of the particles increases the volume available to the polymers, maximising their entropy and the entropy of the system. Addition of succinoglycan to stationary phase Escherichia coli cultures and polystyrene colloids also resulted in aggregation consistent with depletion attraction. Furthermore alternative polymers such as the bacterial extracellular polysaccharide xanthan produced by Xanthomonas campestris can result in aggregation of bacteria by depletion attraction. Depletion attraction may therefore be a ubiquitous force driving aggregation of crowded dispersions of bacteria and polymers. The second part of the thesis focuses on how <b>depletion</b> <b>driven</b> aggregation can lead to surface-associated biofilm formation. Imaging of the sediment formed by the exoS mutant showed that the structure formed at the base of the culture vessel leads to development of an ordered structure composed of interlinked aggregates. The role of succinoglycan in surface attachment is complex and varies with culture conditions. Depletion attraction may facilitate interaction with a surface but alternative factors may then play a role in anchoring the cells to the surface. Under certain conditions the cells may produce factors which allow binding of the cells to a surface independently of succinoglycan. This study has demonstrated for the first time that an extracellular polysaccharide produced by bacteria can result in aggregation via depletion attraction which may be an under explored mechanism by which aggregation of bacteria can occur.

40|$|Monodisperse {{rod-like}} {{colloidal particles}} {{are known for}} spontaneously forming both nematic and smectic liquid crystal phases, but their self-assembly was typically exploited from the fundamental soft condensed matter physics perspective. Here we demonstrate that <b>depletion</b> interactions, <b>driven</b> by non-adsorbing polymers like dextran and surfactants, {{can be used to}} enrich self-organization of photon-upconversion nanorods into orientationally ordered nematic and smectic-like membrane colloidal superstructures. We study thermodynamic phase diagrams and demonstrate polarization-dependent photon upconversion exhibited by the ensuing composites, which arises from the superposition of unique properties of the solid nanostructures and the long-range ordering enabled by liquid crystalline self-organization. Finally, we discuss how our method of utilizing self-assembly due to the steric and electrostatic interactions, along with attractive depletion forces, can enable technological uses of lyotropic colloidal liquid crystals and mesostructured composite materials enabled by them, even when they are formed by anisotropic nanoparticles with relatively small aspect ratios.

40|$|Using Ulysses {{radio wave}} data {{taken during the}} 1992 Jupiter encounter, we {{conclude}} that there are significant large and small spatial scale azimuthal asymmetries at high latitudes in the Io plasma torus. During {{a period of time}} near perijove when the spacecraft motion was predominantly in the azimuthal direction and was relatively fixed in both latitude and radial distance, inferred electron densities depart significantly from the common assumption of longitudinal symmetry. Specifically, electron plasma concentrations near 0 deg system III longitude (and 0400 LT) are greater than those near 180 deg (and 0000 LT). Superposed on this large-scale variation are regularly spaced density depletions, 30 - 50 % in magnitude, and having a spatial periodicity of about 17 deg.

40|$|Here I {{describe}} a new function of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) in driving anti-tumour immune evasion. The kinase activity of FAK in squamous cancer cells drives {{the recruitment of}} regulatory T-cells (Tregs) by transcriptionally regulating chemokine/cytokine and ligand-receptor networks, including the transcription of CCL 5 and TGFβ, which are required for enhanced Treg recruitment. In turn, these changes inhibit antigen-primed cytotoxic CD 8 + T-cell activity in the tumour microenvironment, permitting survival and growth of FAK-expressing tumours. I show that immune evasion requires FAK’s catalytic activity, and a small molecule FAK kinase inhibitor, VS- 4718, which is currently in clinical development, <b>drives</b> <b>depletion</b> of Tregs and permits CD 8 + T-cell-mediated tumour clearance.

40|$|We {{perform a}} general {{study of the}} relic density and LHC {{constraints}} on simplified models where the dark matter coannihilates with a strongly interacting particle X. In these models, the dark matter <b>depletion</b> is <b>driven</b> by the self-annihilation of X to pairs of quarks and gluons through the strong interaction. The phenomenology of these scenarios therefore only depends on the dark matter mass and the mass splitting between dark matter and X {{as well as the}} quantum numbers of X. In this paper, we consider simplified models where X can be either a scalar, a fermion or a vector, as well as a color triplet, sextet or octet. We compute the dark matter relic density constraints taking into account Sommerfeld corrections and bound state formation. Furthermore, we examine the restrictions from thermal equilibrium, the lifetime of X and the current and future LHC bounds on X pair production. All constraints are comprehensively presented in the mass splitting versus dark matter mass plane. While the relic density constraints can lead to upper bounds on the dark matter mass ranging from 2 TeV to more than 10 TeV across our models, the prospective LHC bounds range from 800 to 1500 GeV. A full coverage of the strongly coannihilating dark matter parameter space would therefore require hadron colliders with significantly higher center of mass energies.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether dopaminergic systems {{are involved in}} the motivation to engage in behaviours associated with anorexia nervosa (AN), specifically, the drive to exercise. Women recovered from AN (AN REC, n = 17) and healthy controls (HC, n = 15) were recruited. The acute phenylalanine/tyrosine depletion (APTD) method was used to transiently decrease dopamine synthesis and transmission. The effect of dopamine precursor <b>depletion</b> on <b>drive</b> to exercise was measured using a progressive ratio (PR) exercise breakpoint task. Both groups worked for the opportunity to exercise, and, at baseline, PR breakpoint scores were higher in AN REC than HC. Compared to values on the experimental control session, APTD did not decrease PR breakpoint scores in AN REC, but significantly decreased scores in HC. These data show that women recovered from AN are more motivated to exercise than HC, although in both groups, activity is more reinforcing than inactivity. Importantly, decreasing dopamine does not reduce the motivation to exercise in people recovered from AN, but in contrast, does so in HC. It is proposed that in AN, drive to exercise develops into a behaviour that is largely independent of dopamine mediated reward processes and becomes dependent on cortico-striatal neurocircuitry that regulates automated, habit- or compulsive-like behaviours. These data strengthen the case for the involvement of reward, learning, habit, and dopaminergic systems in the aetiology of AN...|$|R

40|$|Dogs with {{sustained}} anemia plus hypoproteinemia due to {{bleeding and}} a continuing low protein or protein-free diet containing abundant iron {{have been used}} in the present work to test food proteins and supplements as to their See PDF for Structure capacity to produce new hemoglobin and plasma proteins. The reserve stores of blood protein-producing materials are thus largely depleted in such animals and sustained levels of 6 to 8 gm. per cent hemoglobin and 4 to 5 gm. per cent plasma protein can be maintained for considerable periods of time. The stimulus of double <b>depletion</b> <b>drives</b> the body to use all protein building materials with the utmost conservation. This represents a severe biological test for food and body proteins and its assay value must have significance. Measured by this biological test in these experiments, casein stands well up among the best food proteins. The ratio of plasma protein to hemoglobin is about 40 to 50 per cent, which emphasizes the fact that these dogs produce on most diets about 2 gm. hemoglobin to 1 gm. plasma protein. The reason for this preference for hemoglobin production is obscure. The mass of circulating hemoglobin is greater even in this degree of anemia and the life cycle of hemoglobin is much longer than that of the plasma protein. Egg protein, egg albumin, and lactalbumin all favor the production of more plasma protein and less hemoglobin as compared with casein. The plasma protein to hemoglobin ratio is increased, sometimes above 100 per cent. Supplements to the above proteins of casein digests or several amino acids may return the response toward that which is standard for casein. Histidine as a supplement to egg protein increases the total blood protein output and brings the ratio of plasma protein to hemoglobin toward that of casein. Beef muscle goes to the other extreme and favors new hemoglobin production up to 4 gm. hemoglobin to 1 gm. plasma protein—a ratio of 25 per cent. The total amounts of new blood proteins are high. Lactalbumin as compared with casein shows a lower total blood protein output and a plasma protein to hemoglobin ratio of 70 to 90 per cent. Amino acid supplements are less effective. See PDF for Structure Fibrin is a good food protein in these experiments—much like casein. When fed over these 5 week periods it causes a sustained increase in blood fibrinogen. Folic acid in the doses given has no effect on the expected response to various diets. Peanut flour is a very poor diet for the production of new hemoglobin and plasma proteins. Small supplements of casein and beef show a significant response with improved output of blood proteins. Soy bean flour gives a poor response and wheat gluten a good response with adequate output of blood proteins. Visceral products show some variety. Beef heart is not as effective as beef muscle. Beef spleen, kidney, and pancreas give good responses but not up to casein. Pig stomach, beef brain, and calf thymus are below average.
