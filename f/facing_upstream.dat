After long fights, {{it may be necessary}} to manually move water past its gills. This can be done either by holding the trout in moving water with its head <b>facing</b> <b>upstream,</b> or, in calm water, moving the trout backwards and forwards repeatedly. Once stabilized, the trout will swim off on its own. If released prematurely, the trout, not having enough energy to move, will sink to the bottom of the river and suffocate.

The construction began on February 2004, and since there was no place to perform a groundbreaking ceremony, the construction company hired, Fahs Construction Group of Binghamton, New York performed a [...] "bridge-breaking" [...] ceremony on March 25, 2004, taking sledgehammers to the bridge. The bridge was expected to have resemble the Roebling Aqueduct, which lay to the north in Minisink Ford, New York.

It was to also have three balconies <b>facing</b> <b>upstream</b> of the Delaware River, to offer travelers scenic views.|$|E
2500|$|The tripodfish Bathypterois grallator uses tactile and mechanosensory cues to {{identify}} food; it apparently {{does not have}} special visual adaptations to help it find food in the low-light environment. When the fish is perched with its long rays on the ocean floor, it can get food without even seeing it. The tripodfish’s mouth ends up {{at just the right}} height to catch shrimp, tiny fish, and small crustaceans swimming by. They seem to prefer to perch on the mud using much elongated fin rays in their tails and two pelvic fins to stand, <b>facing</b> <b>upstream</b> into the current to ambush with the pectoral fins turned forward so [...] the outthrust projecting fins resemble multiple antennae. The fish senses objects in the water with its front fins. [...] These fins act like hands. [...] Once they feel prey and realize it is edible, the fins knock the food into the fish’s mouth.

2500|$|On 20 August 1960 the Keno was re-floated {{from the}} ways at Whitehorse. Her {{intended}} pilot {{for the final}} voyage, Emil Forrest, was assisting with the process but suffered a fatal heart attack {{during the course of}} the day. While continued preparations for the trip were made to the vessel, a replacement pilot was hurriedly found. On 25 August, under the command of Captain Frank Blakeley and Pilot Frank Slim, the SS Keno left Whitehorse for the final time with a crowd of hundreds gathered to see her off. The most significant of the preparations made to the ship before its departure from Whitehorse were modifications to her superstructure to allow her to pass under the newly constructed highway bridge at Carmacks. Erected since the cessation of steamer traffic on the river this bridge had not been designed to permit vessels as tall as the Keno, let alone her larger fleetmates, to pass beneath. In order to negotiate the limited clearance the SS Keno pilothouse was removed and placed on the roof of the saloon deck, and her smokestack was rigged to hinge backward to lie flat against the roof of the Texas. With her hydraulic tiller installed in the observation room on the saloon deck, Pilot Slim manoeuvred the Keno under the bridge with her bow <b>facing</b> <b>upstream</b> (the better to control the downstream progress of the ship in the fast flowing river) with only [...] to spare. From Carmacks her voyage down the Yukon River was relatively uneventful – she successfully negotiated both the Five Finger and Rink rapids – until she ran aground on an uncharted bar near Minto. With the assistance of CBC reporter and amateur diver Terry Delaney, she was winched off and resumed her downstream progress to Dawson.|$|E

50|$|Arch style {{diversion}} dams {{are designed}} using an arch shape {{with the top}} of the arch <b>facing</b> <b>upstream.</b> The arch shape provides extra strength to counteract the force of the water. Arch style dams are generally constructed in narrow canyons. Arch style dams are commonly made from concrete. To ensure the dam’s integrity, a solid contact between the bedrock foundation and the dam’s concrete base is required. The dome style dam is a type of arch dam. The dome style dam curves in both the horizontal plane and vertical plane. The arch style dam only curves in the horizontal.|$|E

50|$|It is an {{irregular}} rectangular plan {{consisting of two}} enclosures: the exterior, lower level <b>faces</b> <b>upstream</b> with a traitors' gate, and walls reinforced by nine tall circular towers; and the interior enclosure, located in a higher elevation, whose walls are accessible by main gate to the main keep. The keep is three-stories tall and includes the original pads that supported the main truss. The remaining sentry towers are irregular, owing to the irregular terrain. The keep is actually an innovation at this castle, appearing in the 12th century after the Castle of Tomar, the principal defensive redoubt of the Templars in Portugal. Similarly, the watchtowers were innovations brought into {{western part of the}} Iberian peninsula by the Order, and applied in Almourol.|$|R
50|$|Work {{began in}} 2010, when the {{downstream}} {{face of the}} main dam was cleaned and loose concrete, efflorescence and other surface deposits were removed. The concrete face was then protected from further deterioration by using a cementitious repair mortar and siloxane waterproofer. The remedial works on the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> included the installation of a PVC geocomposite membrane, geonet drainage layer and associated drainage system to the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> of the main dam and the auxiliary overflow. The geomembrane is sealed on the concrete face along the foundation line and on the parapet wall 300 mm above the crest level to cover the joint between the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> and the parapet wall.

50|$|Detention dams {{have two}} basic designs. The {{detention}} dam {{can be made}} from concrete or masonry which usually involves the use of a metal reinforcing substructure or frame. The concrete or masonry style dam commonly has a cross sectional shape similar to a right triangle with the sloping face pointing downstream and the perpendicular face pointing upstream. Detention dams can also be made from rock or earth to form a gravity embankment style dam. The cross sectional shape of an earth and rock gravity embankment style dam closely resembles an equal lateral triangle with the angled sides <b>facing</b> <b>upstream</b> and downstream. Detentions dams built today are designed and constructed with large safety factors in order to take into account and compensate for the probability of failure.|$|E
50|$|The tripodfish or tripod spiderfish, Bathypterois grallator, is a deep-sea benthic {{fish in the}} Ipnopidae family {{found at}} lower latitudes.

B. grallator is hermaphroditic. At least 18 species are placed in the genus Bathypterois, several of which have similar appearance and behavior to B. grallator. B. grallator is the largest member of its genus, commonly exceeding a standard length of 30 cm and reaching up to 43.4 cm.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by the Great Western's engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and it was completed in 1838, but not brought into use until 1 July 1839. Brunel's first plan envisaged a triple-arch viaduct, but he then developed the design that is still used today. It was inspired by experiments made by his father, Marc Brunel in 1832 which Isambard {{had at the time}} financed. The railway is carried across the river on two elliptical brick arches, which at the time of building were the widest and flattest in the world. Each span is 128 feet (39 m), with a rise of only 24 feet (7 m). The flatness of the arches was necessary to avoid putting a [...] "hump" [...] in the bridge, which would have gone against Brunel's obsession with flat, gentle gradients (1 in 1,320 on this stretch). The Thames towpath passes under the right-hand arch (<b>facing</b> <b>upstream),</b> which is also known as the Sounding Arch, because of its spectacular echo.|$|E
50|$|In the 20th century, the world's first variable-radius {{arch dam}} {{was built on}} the Salmon Creek near Juneau, Alaska. The Salmon Creek Dam's <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> bulged <b>upstream,</b> which {{relieved}} pressure on the stronger, curved lower arches near the abutments. The dam also had a larger toe, which off-set pressure on the upstream heel of the dam, which now curved more downstream.
