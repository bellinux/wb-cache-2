The airline provides economy class service on all routes, business class (J) service with larger seats in the cabin front on most major <b>domestic</b> <b>routes,</b> premium economy on some international routes, business class on most long-haul and some short-haul international routes, and first class on some long-haul and <b>domestic</b> <b>routes.</b>|$|E
5|$|International flights that {{bypassed}} traditional hub {{airports and}} landed at smaller cities became more common throughout the 1980s, and this eroded the 747's original market. However, many international carriers {{continued to use}} the 747 on Pacific routes. In Japan, 747s on <b>domestic</b> <b>routes</b> were configured to carry close to the maximum passenger capacity.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia has 118 airports, {{of which}} 38 are paved. The {{national}} airline is Malaysia Airlines, providing {{international and domestic}} air services. Major international routes and <b>domestic</b> <b>routes</b> crossing between West Malaysia and East Malaysia are served by Malaysia Airlines, AirAsia and Malindo Air while smaller <b>domestic</b> <b>routes</b> are supplemented by smaller airlines like MASwings, Firefly and Berjaya Air. Major cargo airlines include MASkargo and Transmile Air Services. Kuala Lumpur International Airport is the main and busiest airport of Malaysia. In 2014, it was the world's 13th busiest airport by international passenger traffic, recording over 25.4 million international passenger traffic. It was also the world's 20th busiest airport by passenger traffic, recording over 48.9 million passengers. Other major airports include Kota Kinabalu International Airport, which is also Malaysia's second busiest airport and busiest airport in East Malaysia with over 6.9 million passengers in 2013, and Penang International Airport, which serves Malaysia's second largest urban area, with over 5.4 million passengers in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Three {{airports}} {{were opened}} in Finnmark in 1963, all served by SAS: Alta Airport, Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen and Lakselv Airport, Banak. The following year, SAS also started flights to Tromsø Airport. In 1966, Lufthansa started flights to Hamburg, and later also introduced services to Düsseldorf, Frankfurt and Munich. During the 1960s, SAS introduced Caravelles {{on most of}} the <b>domestic</b> <b>routes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Access {{to foreign}} {{carriers}} on <b>domestic</b> <b>routes</b> is disallowed, while international flights {{will be subject}} to bilateral agreements. To get around this policy, in order to operate within Indonesia, foreign airlines first have to own and operate an Indonesian-based airline. An example of this practice is Indonesia AirAsia, a branch of Malaysian AirAsia; it previously operated as local airline Awair in 2004, before changed to Indonesia AirAsia in 2005.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, Douglas DC-8s {{were also}} taken into use. Pan American World Airways had flights to New York City from 1967 to 1973 and from 1976 to 1978. Braathens SAFE started taking {{delivery}} of Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F-28s in 1969, and these gradually took {{over most of}} the <b>domestic</b> <b>routes.</b> In 1970, Air France and Swissair started flying to Fornebu from Paris and Zurich, respectively. They were supplemented by Aeroflot's Moscow route in 1972.|$|E
5|$|From 1950, Braathens SAFE started flying charter {{services}} to Europe with Douglas DC-6, mainly to Copenhagen and Paris. DNL protested because Braathens SAFE was charging too low ticket prices, while DDL protested against the flights to Copenhagen. In September 1951, Braathens SAFE offered Danish authorities to fly all <b>domestic</b> <b>routes</b> without subsidies, {{but this was}} rejected because such a permit could only be issued to Danish airlines. After World War II, only Fornebu, Stavanger Airport, Sola and Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik were in use as land airport. A plan for construction was passed by parliament in 1952, that based the financing of airports as joint civilian and military airports, with funding from NATO.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, two -100BSR SUD models, {{featuring}} the stretched upper deck (SUD) of the -300, were produced for JAL. The type's maiden flight occurred on February 26, 1986, with FAA certification and first delivery on March 24, 1986. JAL operated the -100BSR SUD with 563 seats on <b>domestic</b> <b>routes</b> until their retirement {{in the third}} quarter of 2006. While only two -100BSR SUDs were produced, in theory, standard -100Bs can be modified to the SUD certification. Overall, twenty-nine 747SRs were built, consisting of seven -100SRs, twenty -100BSRs, and two -100BSR SUDs.|$|E

5|$|No primary {{airports}} {{had been}} built in Helgeland by the mid-1960s. The coastal parts of the region, such as at Brønnøysund, were without highways and railways. Although Widerøe operated a seaplane route, it remained a summer-only service. Travel time to Sandnessjøen, where the closest hospital was located, took five hours. A committee, led by Erik Himle and later Preben Munthe, was appointed in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft {{was about to be}} phased into use on the main <b>domestic</b> <b>routes</b> by Scandinavian Airlines System and the committee recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners, including an airport in Sandnesssjøen.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1 April 1994, all air {{transport}} in Norway {{was restricted to}} airlines that had received concession from the ministry. On the primary <b>domestic</b> <b>routes,</b> the traffic was split between SAS and Braathens SAFE, although both had services to Trondheim and Stavanger. SAS had a monopoly to Bergen and Northern Norway (Alta, Bardufoss, Bodø, Harstad/Narvik, Kirkenes, Longyearbyen and Tromsø), while Braathens SAFE had a monopoly to the other primary airports in Southern Norway (Haugesund, Kristiansand, Kristiansund, Molde, Røros and Ålesund). Widerøe had a monopoly on the regional state-supported routes (Brønnøysund, Florø, Førde, Sandane, Sogndal and Ørsta/Volda), and also served Stord and Sandefjord.|$|E
5|$|Tata SIA Airlines Limited, {{operating}} as Vistara, is an Indian domestic airline based in Gurgaon with its hub at Delhi-Indira Gandhi International Airport. The carrier, {{a joint venture}} between Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines, commenced operations on 9 January 2015 with its inaugural flight between Delhi and Mumbai. The airline had carried more than two million passengers by June 2016 and as of May 2017, has a 3.3% share of the domestic carrier market, making it the 6th largest domestic airline. The airline operates to nineteen destinations with a fleet of Airbus A320-200 aircraft. Vistara was the first airline to introduce premium economy seats on <b>domestic</b> <b>routes</b> in India.|$|E

50|$|Lignes Aériennes Latécoère flew most {{of these}} {{aircraft}} on its routes between France and Morocco. However, eight were used for services to South America, and two on a temporary <b>domestic</b> <b>route</b> between Perpignan, Marseille, and Toulouse.|$|R
5|$|The 767-200 was the {{original}} model and entered service with United Airlines in 1982. The type has been used primarily by mainline U.S. carriers for <b>domestic</b> <b>routes</b> between major hub centers such as Los Angeles to Washington. The 767-200 was the first aircraft to be used on transatlantic ETOPS flights, beginning with TWA on February 1, 1985 under 90-minute diversion rules. Deliveries for the variant totaled 128 aircraft. There were 44 passenger and freighter conversions of the model in commercial service as of July 2016. The type's competitors included the Airbus A300 and A310.|$|E
5|$|The first flights {{serving the}} American bases in Greenland {{operated}} lightweight DHC-3 Otters and Sikorsky S-55 helicopters chartered from Canada. After a crash in 1961, Grønlandsfly used PBY Catalina water planes and DHC-6 Twin Otters on <b>domestic</b> <b>routes.</b> One of the Catalinas then crashed in 1962. In 1965, the Douglas DC-4 became the line's first larger airplane. It {{was followed by}} Sikorsky S-61 helicopters, which have remained in use: in 2010, they still served the communities of Kujalleq municipality in southern Greenland year-round and those of Disko Bay during the winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} Gardermoen had a {{strategic}} impact on aviation in Norway. Despite the {{deregulation of the}} market in 1994, the lack of free slots at Fornebu made it impossible to have free competition, since no new airlines could establish themselves and no new international airlines could fly to Fornebu. Gardermoen allowed this to happen, and from 1 August 1998, Color Air started with flights from Oslo, pressing down prices on <b>domestic</b> <b>routes.</b> Although the airline went bankrupt the following year, the losses for Braathens were so high that it was taken over by SAS. The gap was then filled by Norwegian Air Shuttle.|$|E
5000|$|Now {{rights to}} fly a <b>domestic</b> <b>route</b> {{to and from the}} airport are held by Tamir Airways, while rights to operate the landing strip are owned by a {{separate}} company that is in a dispute with Tamir Airways.|$|R

5|$|A committee, led by Erik Himle {{and later}} Preben Munthe, was {{appointed}} in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle {{was about to}} the phased into use on the main <b>domestic</b> <b>routes</b> and the committee recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners, including one airport in Florø. Widerøe came with an alternative proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead, which could be served using short take-off and landing aircraft, which were being developed at the time. Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower cost than larger airports, but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate. Håkon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965 and was a proponent of the STOLport proposal. The political rationale was that, despite that the total operating costs would rise, it would provide better services to rural areas and thus keep up their population.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE's {{domestic}} market was deregulated on 1 April 1994. Since then, any airline within the European Economic Area {{is free to}} operate any domestic or international route. Braathens rejected a proposal from the main competitor Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) for a merger; instead the helicopter division was sold and the company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. New routes were opened from Oslo Airport, Fornebu to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, but the routes from Bergen to these cities were terminated. International routes to Rome, Nice and Jersey were introduced. In 1996, Braathens SAFE bought Sweden's second-largest airline, Transwede, and started flying on the Oslo–Stockholm route. The following year, Transwede, with its five <b>domestic</b> <b>routes,</b> was merged into Braathens SAFE. The same year, KLM bought 30% of Braathens SAFE and the airlines started a partnership.|$|E
5|$|By 1966, Braathens SAFE {{had sold}} all its DC-4s, and had {{purchased}} eight F-27s. The DC-6s were used exclusively for charter, with all domestic flights being flown with the F-27s. The same year, the booking system was centralized {{and moved to}} offices in Oslo. The company established sales offices in Bodø and Tromsø on 1 March 1967. A new cargo department was opened at Oslo Airport on 29 September. Braathens SAFE applied in {{a joint venture with}} the Norwegian America Line to start a cargo flight to the United States and the Far East, but this was declined by the ministry. From 1967, also DC-6s were used on <b>domestic</b> <b>routes.</b> In August, it was announced that Braathens SAFE would replace the F-27s with six new Fokker F-28, and that the F-27s would be sold to the manufacturer. Later, the number of orders of 737s was reduced to two, and of F-28s to five. The Fellowships cost NOK40 million each.|$|E
