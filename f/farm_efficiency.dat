A stochastic frontier analysis is used because, in addition to accounting for sources of growth in agricultural output, this method explicitly incorporates efficiency differences in the analysis. The empirical analysis uses panel data from the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey collected during 1994 through 2009. The results indicate that most of the increase in agricultural output is attained by increased use of traditional inputs such as size and quality of cultivated land, labor, numbers of oxen and hoes, and was heavily influenced by amount of precipitation received. By contrast, the rate of fertilizer application contributed little for increase in output. Participation in the extension program made moderate contribution towards increases in output. Each agroecological zone included in the study gained from Hicks-neutral technological improvements during the 1994 – 2004 period. Nonetheless productivity levels in 2009 were not different from levels in 1994, and they had declined between 2004 and 2009. Average level of <b>farming</b> <b>efficiency</b> for the surveyed farmers across all the years was 0. 46, indicating that an average farmer produces {{less than half of the}} value of output produced by the most efficient farmer using the same technology and inputs. However, average <b>farming</b> <b>efficiency</b> has improved during the 1995 – 2009 period. Farm households’ level of <b>farming</b> <b>efficiency</b> is improved by reducing labor bottlenecks and increased education. Households that have diversified risk from plots that are located sufficiently apart appear more efficient. Households that own more animals both in terms of two or more ploughing oxen or total livestock units are more efficient. Drought affects efficiency adversely whenever it strikes. Farmers that live in close proximity to markets are less efficient. On average, farming inefficiency has consistently declined in the period considered.

40|$|Labor {{markets in}} all economies {{are subject to}} {{transaction}} costs associated with recruiting, monitoring and supervising workers. Rural labor markets in developing economies, where institutions such as labor and contract law and formal employment assistance mechanisms are not in place, are regarded to be particularly sensitive to transaction cost conditions. The inherent difficult of measuring transaction costs has limited studies on this topic. In this paper, we analyze supervision activities reported in a cross-section survey of rice farmers in the Bicol region of the Philippines. This survey is unique because it provides supervision data at the farm task level. We present a simple optimization model in which supervision intensity increases the productivity of hired workers, which {{is assumed to be}} lower than that of family members due to the transaction costs. The model predicts that supervision intensity will increase with transaction costs. We use different institutional conditions to proxy for transaction costs, and estimate the demand for supervision time for four different classes of rice production tasks. The estimation strategy controls for selectivity in both hiring and supervising. The results show a positive effect of transaction costs on supervision intensity. We then extend the analysis to a <b>farm</b> <b>efficiency</b> specification to test the proposition that supervision activities improve <b>farm</b> <b>efficiency.</b> This framework allows us to relate institutional conditions to <b>farm</b> <b>efficiency</b> directly and indirectly through their effect on supervision activities. We find that transaction costs have a negative direct effect on <b>farm</b> <b>efficiency,</b> but this is partially offset by the positive efficiency effects of increased supervision intensity. The results enable us to associate institutional conditions with transaction costs and to draw policy inferences regarding the value of improved institutional conditions.
