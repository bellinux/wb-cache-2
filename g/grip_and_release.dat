6000|$|That night I hunted up an old fisherman, {{who had a}} big {{store of}} {{information}} in his head about all kinds of wild things, {{and asked him if}} he had ever seen a shoal-duck in fresh water. [...] "Once or twice," [...] he said; [...] "they kept dipping their heads under water, kinder crazy like." [...] But he had no explanation to offer until I showed him the mussel that I had found on the duck's tongue. Then his face lightened. [...] "Mussels of that kind won't live in fresh water," [...] he declared at a glance; and then the explanation of the birds' queer actions flashed into both our heads at once: the eiders were simply drowning the mussels in order to make them loosen their <b>grip</b> <b>and</b> <b>release</b> the captive tongues.|$|E

30|$|Although the <b>gripping</b> <b>and</b> <b>releasing</b> torques in the gripper axis have no {{influence}} on the first axis driving torque, the yaw axis torque does interfere with the first axis driving torque. Therefore, the first axis drive system must be designed with enough drive torque and stiffness of the joints to overcome increases in angular moment when the yaw axis interferes with the pitch axis. To increase the joint stiffness, stiffer wires and large-diameter pulleys can be used. The kinematics of the proposed wrist mechanism is almost the same as conventional clinical use articulated forceps [7].|$|R

25|$|The {{cable car}} begins moving when a {{clamping}} device {{attached to the}} car, called a grip, applies pressure to ("grips") the moving cable. Conversely, the car is stopped by releasing pressure on the cable (with or without completely detaching) and applying the brakes. This <b>gripping</b> <b>and</b> <b>releasing</b> action may be manual, {{as was the case}} in all early cable car systems, or automatic, as is the case in some recent cable operated people mover type systems. Gripping must be an even and gradual process in order to avoid bringing the car to cable speed too quickly and unacceptably jarring the passengers.|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the tarsal claws, the {{spinning}} apparatus, and other factors affecting drag-line spinning has been made using certain orb-web spiders, principally Araneus diadematus. The structure of the tarsal claws suggests that they are incapable of smoothly controlling {{the speed at which}} the silk thread is extracted, although they can <b>grip</b> <b>and</b> <b>release</b> the thread quickly. Evidence is presented that smooth control of spinning is achieved through the inter-action of the intra-abdominal pressure and the control valve which lies in the silk duct. The intra-abdominal pressure is shown to be equivalent to from 3 to 4 cm of mercury, and to be responsible for moving the fluid silk out of the gland and up the duct. The experimental results also suggest that the control valve regulates the amount of fluid silk available for spinning as a thread and that it also acts as the func-tional spinning orifice, its aperture controlling the diameter of the thread spun...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} a simple passive universal gripper, {{consisting of a}} mass of granular material encased in an elastic membrane. Using a combination {{of positive and negative}} pressure, the gripper can rapidly <b>grip</b> <b>and</b> <b>release</b> a wide range of objects that are typically challenging for universal grippers, such as flat objects, soft objects, or objects with complex geometries. The gripper passively conforms to the shape of a target object, then vacuumhardens to grip it rigidly, later utilizing positive pressure to reverse this transition—releasing the object and returning to a deformable state. We describe the mechanical design and implementation of this gripper and quantify its performance in real-world testing situations. By using both positive and negative pressure, we demonstrate performance increases of up to 85 % in reliability, 25 % in error tolerance, and the added capability to shoot objects by fast ejection. In addition, multiple objects are gripped and placed at once while maintaining their relative distance and orientation. We conclude by comparing the performance of the proposed gripper with others in the field. Index Terms—End effectors, grain size, jamming, manipulators, pressure control. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between grip force and external forearm pressure in nondisabled subjects using force myography (FMG). FMG uses a sensorized cuff surrounding the forearm to register the distributed mechanical force, detect-ing pressure on the sensors generated by the volumetric changes of the underlying musculo-tendinous complex. Each of nine nondisabled subjects donned the FMG cuff and applied grip forces to a cylindrical dynamometer; grip forces ranged from 0 % to 100 % of the subjects ’ maximum voluntary contrac-tion. The cuff was positioned with seven force sensors located on both the anterior and posterior surfaces of the proximal forearm, but no {{attempt was made to}} match sensor placement with particular muscles or sites. Grip prediction was simply encoded as the rectified sum of the FMG sensor outputs. Dur-ing <b>grip</b> <b>and</b> <b>release</b> cycles, the FMG waveforms of each sub-ject correlated closely with his or her force waveforms (r> 0. 89). FMG also correlated highly with the timing of grip onset and release (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC(A, 2)) = 0. 99) and time to peak (ICC(A, 2) = 0. 91), with negligible lag. These results demonstrate that when applied to the forearm, FMG represents a grip force signature that may be useful for near-real-time proportional control of upper-limb prosthetic devices...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to design and develope a Pick and Position system to displace spherical-shaped fruits, with minimum damage to flesh, from one specific place to another. A mechanical gripper (end-effector) suitable for grasping spherical-shaped fruits with 5 - 9 cm in diameter was designed and developed. The primary goal of the gripper design was to take <b>and</b> <b>release</b> the fruit without bruising it in a specified time sequence. A slider-crank mechanism was used to drive the gripper. To achieve suitable timing in <b>gripping</b> <b>and</b> <b>releasing</b> of the fruit, the slider was driven by a cam. The kinematic and dynamic analysis of the gripping unit was done and its motion was simulated using Working Modwl software. In the next step, a four-bar mechanism (arm) was designed and developed to displace gripper between two specified locations. After kinematic analysis, equation of motion of the arm mechanism was derived and its dynamic analysis was performed. The gripper was assembled on the arm mechanism and the performance of the gripper and arm mechanism was investigated. It was observed that the system had the ability to pick <b>and</b> <b>release</b> the oblong fruits, such as apple, between two specified locations. The performance of the system for larger size fruits could be improved by some modifications on the gripper fingers...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} recent {{developments}} in grippers {{that are based on}} capillary force and condensed water droplets. These are used for manipulating micro-sized objects. Recently, one-finger grippers have been produced that are able to reliably grip using the capillary force. To release objects, either the van der Waals, gravitational or inertial-forces method is used. This article presents methods for reliably <b>gripping</b> <b>and</b> <b>releasing</b> micro-objects using the capillary force. The moisture from the surrounding air is condensed into a thin layer of water on the contact surfaces of the objects. From the thin layer of water, a water meniscus between the micro-sized object, the gripper <b>and</b> the <b>releasing</b> surface is created. Consequently, the water meniscus between the object <b>and</b> the <b>releasing</b> surface produces a high enough capillary force to release the micro-sized object from the tip of the one-finger gripper. In this case, either polystyrene, glass beads with diameters between 5 – 60 µm, or irregularly shaped dust particles of similar sizes were used. 3 D structures made up of micro-sized objects could be constructed using this method. This method is reliable for <b>releasing</b> during assembly <b>and</b> also for <b>gripping,</b> when the objects are removed {{from the top of the}} 3 D structure—the so-called “disassembling gripping” process.

40|$|AbstractGeckos {{can climb}} {{steadily}} and quickly on different surfaces under various environmental conditions. Extensive experiments {{have been conducted}} using gecko toe, setal array, single seta and single spatula to explore the physical principles of gecko adhesion and friction. This work focuses {{on the effect of}} environment (i. e. substrate materials and relative humidity [RH]) and experimental conditions (i. e. preload, sliding velocity, and sliding direction) on gecko adhesion and friction through an isolated gecko setal array. Experimental results show that when sliding a setal array in <b>gripping</b> direction, adhesion <b>and</b> friction can be enhanced by more than 200 % by increasing surface energy, 60 % by increasing relative humidity, and only slightly by increasing sliding velocity; an appropriate preload increase can also cause an enhancement. When RH > 40 %, adhesion and friction become saturated, and higher sliding velocity and preload can realize the saturation at a lower RH. When a preload is oversized in gripping direction or when sliding a setal array against substrates in releasing direction, the setal array deforms severely and always exhibits a preload-dominated repulsion. A strong anisotropic property is revealed when sliding a setal array in <b>gripping</b> <b>and</b> <b>releasing</b> direction. These results help understand the remarkable abilities of gecko swiftly controlling strong attachment and easy detachment, which inspire the design and fabrication of gecko-inspired reversible dry adhesives...|$|R

The flexible electrostatic gripper {{when combined with}} a simple steerable extendible boom can <b>grip,</b> position, <b>and</b> <b>release</b> objects of various shapes and materials with low mass and power without any prior handles or physical accommodations or surface contamination for ISS experiment experiments and in-situ repair. (F) (G) 4. The Dexterous Docking concept previously proposed to allow simple commercial resupply ships to station-keep and capture either ISS or an Exploration vehicle for supply or fluid transfer lacked a self-sensing, compliant, soft capture gripper like FETCH that could retract and attach to a CBM. (I) 5. To enable a soft capture and de-orbit {{of a piece of}} orbital debris will require self-aligning <b>gripping</b> <b>and</b> holding an object wherever possible (thermal coverings or shields of various materials, radiators, solar arrays, antenna dishes) with little or no residual power while adding either drag or active low level thrust. (K) 6. With the scalability of the FETCH technology, small satellites can be captured and handled or can incorporate FETCH gripper to dock to and handle other small vehicles and larger objects for de-orbiting or mitigating Orbital debris (L) 7. Many of previous MSFC and NASA proposals or concepts can now be realized or simplified by the development of the this initial and future FETCH grippers including commercial resupply, Exploration vehicle assembly, Satellite servicing, and orbital debris removal since a major part of these missions is to align to and capture some handle.
