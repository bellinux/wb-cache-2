25|$|In 1992, it was {{announced}} that the Labradors were to be replaced by 15 new helicopters, a variant of the AgustaWestland EH101, designated CH-149 Chimo. The order was subsequently cancelled by the Jean Chrétien Liberal government in 1993, resulting in cancellation penalties, as well as <b>extending</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>life</b> of the Labrador fleet. However, in 1998, a CH-113 from CFB Greenwood crashed on Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula while returning from a SAR mission, resulting in the deaths of all crewmembers on board. The crash placed pressure upon the government to procure a replacement, thus an order was placed with the manufacturers of the EH101 for 15 aircraft to perform the search-and-rescue mission, designated CH-149 Cormorant. CH-149 deliveries began in 2003, allowing the last CH-113 to be retired in 2004. In October 2005 Columbia Helicopters of Aurora, Oregon purchased eight of the retired CH-113 Labradors to add to their fleet of 15 Vertol 107-II helicopters.|$|E

50|$|Despite the ROCN {{refurbishing}} and <b>extending</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>life</b> of its {{vessels and}} equipment, it {{has suffered from}} procurement difficulties due to pressures exerted by the PRC. It has only two useful submarines. The U.S. has approved sales of eight new diesel powered submarines but lacks the manufacturing capability to make the engines; at the same time, threats from the PRC prevent the necessary technology transfer from other countries. Furthermore, the Legislative Yuan did not approve the budget and thereby slowed the opportunity to procure the badly needed underwater defense capability.|$|E

50|$|A {{recent study}} was {{conducted}} that shows that diamond grinding is {{an effective means of}} <b>extending</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>life</b> of concrete by imparting a smooth pavement surface with desirable surface texture.

The California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS), a pioneer in the use of diamond grinding to preserve their concrete roadways, has determined that the average age of a diamond ground surface in California is between 16 and 17 years, and a pavement can be diamond ground up to three times.|$|E
50|$|BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin {{competed for}} the WCSP contracts. Lockheed Martin's WFLIP upgrade {{was based on}} the {{existing}} Warrior turret. BAE Systems designed a new turret. In March 2011, it was announced that Lockheed Martin had effectively won the competition to develop both the WFLIP and FRES turrets. Severe budgetary pressures made it uncertain whether these defence projects were to be delayed or curtailed, but it was announced in October 2011 that the Warrior upgrades would proceed at a cost of one billion pounds, <b>extending</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>life</b> of the Warrior to 2040 and beyond.

50|$|An {{individual}} tire's life {{follows the}} bathtub curve, to boot. After installation, {{there is a}} not-small probability of failure which {{may be related to}} material or workmanship or even to the process for mounting the tire which may introduce some small damage. After the initial period, the tire will perform, given no defect introducing event such as encountering a road hazard (a nail or a pothole), for a long duration relative to its expected service life which is a function of several variables (design, material, process). After a period, the failure probability will rise; for some tires, this will occur after the tread is worn out. Then, a secondary market for tires puts a retread on the tire thereby <b>extending</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>life.</b> It is not uncommon for an 80,000-mile tire to perform well beyond that limit.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of using an in situ wet layup fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) repairing system to <b>extend</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>life</b> of electric distribution and transmission wooden poles. The effectiveness of the FRP strengthening method was evaluated through field tests performed on Class- 4 deteriorated wooden poles and a step-by-step rapid installation procedure was developed.

In addition, the repaired poles exceeded the minimum lateral load required by the NESC and ANSI 05. 1 codes indicating that it would be more cost-effective repairing the poles than replacing them.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s the United States Air Force {{requested}} a dedicated {{close air support}} (CAS) plane that became the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. It eventually became a primarily anti-armor weapon with limited capability in the interdiction and tactical bombing role, {{and even in the}} anti-tank role it initially met with mixed feelings. The A-10's performance during Operation Desert Storm negated these criticisms. It remained the only dedicated fixed-wing ground-attack aircraft in U.S. service. Overall U.S. experience in the Gulf War, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq War has resulted in renewed interest in such aircraft. Officially, the U.S. Air Force planned to replace the A-10, with its new [...] "Joint Strike Fighter", the F-35 Lightning II. Facing political concerns that the new fighters were not designed for the ground-attack role that had proven particularly useful in Iraq and Afghanistan, a plan to decommission the A-10 has been replaced with a plan to upgrade the existing aircraft with improved electronics, <b>extending</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>life</b> of the planes until as late as 2028. The U.S. Air Force has not commissioned any new designs for this role (in part, out of concern for the F-35 program). Nevertheless, the current U.S. doctrine emphasizes the use of United States Army helicopters for close air support and anti-tank missions. Nevertheless, a Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance program has been initiated by the USAF.|$|E

40|$|Concrete is {{a widely}} used {{construction}} material. However, the production of concrete for new buildings and the eventual demolition of old buildings generate a large carbon footprint that causes global warming and a large volume of solid waste that uses up valuable landfill space. In order to mitigate these problems, there is a pressing need to reduce the consumption of concrete and <b>extend</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>life</b> of concrete buildings. For such purposes, the authors have been advocating the usage of more high-performance concrete (HPC), which has higher strength, durability and workability than normal concrete. The higher strength could reduce the volume of concrete needed whereas the higher durability could <b>extend</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>life</b> of concrete buildings. In this regard, there is often the misunderstanding that HPC, which usually contains more cementitious materials, would generate a larger carbon footprint. Herein, life-cycle analysis of the carbon footprint of concrete construction is conducted to demonstrate that although HPC tends {{to have a higher}} cementitious material content per unit volume, due to the reduced volume of concrete needed and <b>the</b> <b>extended</b> <b>service</b> <b>life</b> of buildings, its carbon footprint is actually much lower...|$|R

40|$|Data {{obtained}} from testing shipping package materials have been leveraged to support <b>extending</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>life</b> of select shipping packages while in nuclear materials transportation. Increasingly, nuclear material inventories are being transferred to an interim storage location {{where they will}} reside for extended periods of time. Use of a shipping package to store nuclear materials in an interim storage location has become more attractive {{for a variety of}} reasons. Shipping packages are robust and have a qualified pedigree for their performance in normal operation and accident conditions within the approved shipment period and storing nuclear material within a shipping package results in reduced operations for the storage facility. However, the shipping package materials of construction must maintain a level of integrity as specified by the safety basis of the storage facility through the duration of the storage period, which is typically well beyond the one year transportation window.
