50|$|Tissue factor, {{also called}} {{platelet}} tissue factor, <b>factor</b> <b>III,</b> thromboplastin, or CD142 is a protein encoded by the F3 gene present in subendothelial tissue and leukocytes. Its {{role in the}} clotting process is the initiation of thrombin formation from the zymogen prothrombin.

5000|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym for the protein tissue factor (with its official name [...] "Coagulation <b>factor</b> <b>III</b> tissue factor"), this is a misconception. Historically, thromboplastin was a lab reagent, usually derived from placental sources, used to assay prothrombin times (PT). Thromboplastin, by itself, could activate the extrinsic coagulation pathway. When manipulated in the laboratory, a derivative could be created called partial thromboplastin. Partial thromboplastin {{was used to measure}} the intrinsic pathway. This test is called the aPTT, or activated partial thromboplastin time. It was not until much later that the subcomponents of thromboplastin and partial thromboplastin were identified. Thromboplastin is the combination of both phospholipids and tissue factor, both of which are needed in the activation of the extrinsic pathway. However, partial thromboplastin is just phospholipids, and not tissue factor.|$|E
50|$|The F3 gene encodes {{coagulation}} <b>factor</b> <b>III</b> {{which is}} a cell surface glycoprotein. This factor enables cells to initiate the blood coagulation cascades, and it functions as the high-affinity receptor for the coagulation factor VII. The resulting complex provides a catalytic event {{that is responsible for}} initiation of the coagulation protease cascades by specific limited proteolysis. Unlike the other cofactors of these protease cascades, which circulate as nonfunctional precursors, this factor is a potent initiator that is fully functional when expressed on cell surfaces. There are 3 distinct domains of this factor: extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic. This protein is {{the only one in the}} coagulation pathway for which a congenital deficiency has not been described. In addition to the membrane-bound tissue factor, soluble form of tissue factor was also found which results from alternatively spliced tissue factor mRNA transcripts, in which exon 5 is absent and exon 4 is spliced directly to exon 6.|$|E

The necessity to find effective invariants to distinguish full type <b>III</b> <b>factors</b> comes from the problem of classifying type <b>III</b> <b>factors</b> naturally occurring in free probability theory of Voiculescu [22].

40|$|Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum {{grown on}} mineral medium {{contains}} 120 nmol of Co alpha-(5 -hydroxybenzimidazolyl) cobamides (derivatives of <b>factor</b> <b>III)</b> per g of dry cell mass {{as the sole}} cobamide. The bacterium assimilated several corrinoids and benzimidazole bases during autotrophic growth. The corrinoids were converted into factor III; however, after three transfers in 5, 6 -dimethylbenzimidazole (200 microM) -supplemented mineral medium, derivatives of <b>factor</b> <b>III</b> were completely replaced by derivatives of vitamin B 12, which is atypical for methanogens. The total cobamide content of these cells and their growth rate were not affected compared with factor III-containing cells. Therefore, the high cobamide content rather than {{a particular type of}} cobamide is required for metabolism of methanogens. Derivatives of <b>factor</b> <b>III</b> are not essential cofactors of cobamide-containing enzymes from methanogenic bacteria, but they are the result of a unique biosynthetic ability of these archaebacteria. The cobamide biosynthesis include unspecific enzymes, which made it possible either to convert non-species-derived corrinoids into derivatives of <b>factor</b> <b>III</b> or to synthesize other types of cobamides than <b>factor</b> <b>III.</b> The cobamide biosynthesis is regulated by its end product. In addition, the uptake of extracellular cobamides is controlled, and the assimilated corrinoids regulate cellular cobamide biosynthesis...|$|E

40|$|The trimeric phosphocarrier protein <b>factor</b> <b>III</b> {{specific}} for galactosides {{was investigated}} by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. The protomer contains four histidyl residues with acidic pK {{values in the}} range 5. 6 - 6. 2. One of the histidyl residues, His-B, carries the phosphoryl group. The pK value of His-B increases from 6. 0 to 8. 6 upon phosphorylation. To determine {{the position of the}} phosphoryl group with respect to the nitrogens required the isolation of a peptide T- 2 containing the phosphorylated active-center histidine and one of the other histidines. The pK value and the chemical shift of the phosphopeptide clearly indicated the phosphorus to be bound to the N- 3 atom of the imidazole ring. The temperature dependence of the <b>factor</b> <b>III</b> spectrum demonstrates multiple conformations which exchange rapidly on the NMR time scale. Titration of <b>factor</b> <b>III</b> with HPr protein showed an upfield shift of the active-center histidine, indicating complex formation between both proteins.

The product, apoprotein III, was homogeneous by anayltical polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, and it induced monospecific antibodies in rabbits and goat as shown by immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis.
