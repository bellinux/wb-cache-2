Pareto-optimal curves showing the relationship between the workspace size and the manipulability are presented as a tool for the designer.

40|$|Many {{manufacturing}} {{systems are}} exposed {{to a variety of}} unforeseen changes, negatively restricting their performances. External variations depending on market demand (e. g. changes in design, quantity and product mix) and internal variations in production capability and flexibility (e. g. equipment breakdowns, missing/worn/broken tools, delays and express orders) all contribute to an environment of uncertainty. In these dynamically changing environments, adaptability is a key feature for manufacturing systems to be able to perform at a maximum level, while keeping unscheduled downtime to a minimum. Targeting manufacturing equipment adaptability, this paper reports an assembly feature (AF) based approach for robotic assembly, using IEC 61499 compliant Function Blocks (FBs). Through the use of a network of event-driven FBs, an adaptive controller system for an industrial <b>gantry</b> <b>robot’s</b> assembly operations has been designed, implemented and tested. Basic assembly operations have been mapped as AFs into Assembly Feature Function Blocks (AF-FBs).

40|$|<b>Gantry</b> <b>robots</b> and {{anthropomorphic}} arms {{of various}} sizes have already been studied and, while they are in use {{in some parts of}} the world for automated construction, a new kind of wide workspace machinery, cable-driven parallel robots (CDPR), has emerged. These robots are capable of automated movement in a very wide workspace, using cables reeled in and out by winches as actuation members, the other elements being easily stacked for easy relocation and reconfiguration, which is critical for on-site construction. The motivation of this paper is to showcase the potential of a CDPR operating solely on motor position sensors and showing limited collisions from the cables for large-scale applications in the building industry relevant for additive manufacturing, without risk of collisions between the cables and the building. The combination of the Cogiro CDPR (Tecnalia, LIRMM-CNRS 2010) with the extruder and material of the Pylos project (IAAC 2013) opens the opportunity to a 3 D printing machine with a workspace of 13. 6 × 9. 4 × 3. 3 m. The design patterns for printing on such a large scale are disclosed, as well as the modifications that were necessary for both the Cogiro robot and Pylos extruder and material. Two prints, with different patterns, have been achieved with the Pylos extruder mounted on Cogiro: the first spanning 3. 5 m in length, the second, reaching a height of 0. 86 m.
