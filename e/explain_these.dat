5|$|A {{series of}} reports {{in the summer of}} 1944 {{produced}} by Bomber Command's operational research division attempted to <b>explain</b> <b>these</b> differences, starting with problems in the bombsight itself. However, almost all of the reasons ultimately offered were purely operational in nature. These included the fact that the target indicator flares used as a reference covered an area of , that the bombers were dropping salvos of bombs, not a single test bomb, and that the Master Bomber would change the marking point during the process of the raid, making it very difficult to correlate the bomb craters to the marking.|$|E
5|$|GRBs {{were first}} {{detected}} in 1967 by the Vela satellites, {{which had been}} designed to detect covert nuclear weapons tests. Following their discovery, hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to <b>explain</b> <b>these</b> bursts, such as collisions between comets and neutron stars. Little information was available to verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their redshifts using optical spectroscopy, and thus their distances and energy outputs. These discoveries, and subsequent studies of the galaxies and supernovae associated with the bursts, clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs, definitively placing them in distant galaxies.|$|E

5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} and pollution are major threats to their conservation; river otters are highly sensitive to pollution and readily accumulate {{high levels of}} mercury, organochloride compounds, and other chemical elements. The species is often used as a bioindicator because of its position {{at the top of}} the food chain in aquatic ecosystems. Environmental disasters, such as oil spills, may increase levels of blood haptoglobin and interleukin-6 immunoreactive protein, but decrease body mass. Home ranges of river otters increase in size on oiled areas compared to unoiled areas, and individual otters also modify their habitat use. Declines in the richness and diversity of prey species may <b>explain</b> <b>these</b> changes.|$|E
5|$|The {{granitic}} gneiss rocks {{throughout the}} entire coastline are home to large populations of invertebrates, fish and seaweed. These gneiss and the dunes form rich ecosystems, but are threatened by waterfront construction, holiday-makers and dune sports. Short-beaked common dolphins occur in large numbers in Northern Portugal. Dolphins show themselves by porpoising and bowriding along with boats just off the city of Póvoa de Varzim, where fishing activities occur. Alive or dead discarded fish while fishing can be easily caught by dolphins, which could help explain this relationship in the city's waters. Stranded whales and dolphins and found dead occur with some frequency, natural causes, rough seas events, incidents with ships or fishing boats can <b>explain</b> <b>these</b> events.|$|E
5|$|These two {{populations have}} been {{observed}} in many galaxies, especially massive elliptical galaxies.

Many scenarios have been suggested to <b>explain</b> <b>these</b> subpopulations, including violent gas-rich galaxy mergers, the accretion of dwarf galaxies, and multiple phases of star formation in a single galaxy. In the Milky Way, the metal-poor clusters are associated with the halo and the metal-rich clusters with the bulge.|$|E

5|$|Karluk left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The {{immediate}} destination was Nome, {{on the coast}} of the Bering Sea. There was trouble from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention. On 2 July Karluk reached the Bering Sea in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined Alaska and Mary Sachs. While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson's attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected Karluk to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not <b>explain</b> <b>these</b> matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.|$|E
5|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that adding seductive details does not have a {{significant}} impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at cognitive load theory to <b>explain</b> <b>these</b> controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the cognitive load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.|$|E
5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to <b>explain</b> <b>these</b> basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E

5|$|The {{etymology}} of Mirza puzzled researchers {{for many}} years. Gray often created mysterious and unexplained taxonomic names—a trend not only continued with {{his description of}} Mirza in 1870, {{but also with the}} genera Phaner (fork-marked lemurs) and Azema (for M.rufus, now a synonym for Microcebus), both of which were described in the same publication. In 1904, American zoologist Theodore Sherman Palmer attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively <b>explain</b> <b>these</b> three genera. For Mirza, Palmer only noted that it derived from the Persian title mîrzâ ("prince"), a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. However, because the reference to Persian princes might have come from Arabian Nights, a popular piece of literature at the time, Dunkel et al. also searched the general literature published around 1870. The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy The Palace of Truth by W. S. Gilbert, which premiered in London on 19November1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing all three names: King Phanor (sic), Mirza, and Azema. The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.|$|E
