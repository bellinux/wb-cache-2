5|$|No <b>Doubt</b> <b>is</b> the self-titled debut studio album by the American {{rock band}} No Doubt, {{released}} March 17, 1992 on Interscope Records. The album was originally recorded {{as an independent}} release, but was re-recorded after the band was signed to Interscope. It was produced by Dito Godwin and recorded in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|The George C. Marshall Institute and Fred Singer, {{two of the}} subjects, {{have been}} {{critical}} of the book. Other reviewers have been more favorable. One reviewer said that Merchants of <b>Doubt</b> <b>is</b> exhaustively researched and documented, and {{may be one of the}} most important books of 2010. Another reviewer saw the book as his choice for best science book of the year. It was made into a film, Merchants of Doubt, directed by Robert Kenner, released in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Jain {{references}} to this parable {{are found in}} Tattvarthaslokavatika of Vidyanandi (9th century) and it appears twice in the Syādvādamanjari of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). According to Mallisena, whenever anyone takes a partial, unconditional view of the ultimate reality, and denies the possibility of another aspect of that reality, it is an instance of the above parable and a defective view. Mallisena goes further in his second reference to the above parable and states that all reality has infinite aspects and attributes, all assertions can only be relatively true. This does not mean scepticism or <b>doubt</b> <b>is</b> the right path to knowledge, according to Mallisena and other Jain scholars, but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally, partially true. Any and all viewpoints, states Mallisena, that do not admit an exception are false views.|$|E

25|$|In {{many of the}} manuscripts {{in which}} asterisks or other marks appear in the margin {{alongside}} the passage, the marks do not accompany 7:52-8:2, but only 8:3-11, thus indicating {{where to find the}} lection for the Feast-day of St. Pelagia; the notion that the asterisks in these copies were intended to express scribal <b>doubt</b> <b>is</b> a misunderstanding of the lectionary apparatus.|$|E
25|$|No <b>Doubt</b> <b>is</b> an American {{rock band}} from Anaheim, California, that formed in 1986.

Since the mid-1990s in live performances and the studio, they have been supported by keyboardist and trombonist Gabrial McNair and keyboardist and trumpeter Stephen Bradley.|$|E

25|$|We {{should note}} that Descartes' <b>doubt</b> <b>is</b> a methodological and {{rational}} doubt. That is, the Meditator is not just doubting everything at random, but is providing solid reasons for his doubt at each stage. For instance, he rejects {{the possibility that he}} might be mad, since that would undercut the rationality that motivates his doubt. Descartes is trying to set up this doubt within a rational framework, and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, if {{reasonable}} doubt exists {{that the death}} {{may not have been}} suicide or that the deceased might have changed her mind and repented at the last moment (e.g., if it is unknown whether the victim fell or jumped from a building, or if the person falling changed her mind mid-fall), the benefit of the <b>doubt</b> <b>is</b> given and regular burial and mourning rituals take place. Lastly, the suicide of a minor is considered a result of a lack of understanding ("da'at"), and in such a case, regular mourning is observed.|$|E
25|$|The term connotes that {{evidence}} establishes a particular {{point to a}} moral certainty which precludes the existence of any reasonable alternatives. It {{does not mean that}} no doubt exists as to the accused's guilt, but only that no reasonable <b>doubt</b> <b>is</b> possible from the evidence presented. Further to this notion of moral certainty, where the trier of fact relies on proof that is solely circumstantial, i.e., when conviction is based entirely on circumstantial evidence, certain jurisdictions specifically require the prosecution's burden of proof to be such that the facts proved must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than guilt.|$|E

25|$|Kierkegaard {{primarily}} discusses subjectivity {{with regard}} to religious matters. As already noted, he argues that <b>doubt</b> <b>is</b> an element of faith {{and that it is}} impossible to gain any objective certainty about religious doctrines such as the existence of God or the life of Christ. The most one could hope for would be the conclusion that it is probable that the Christian doctrines are true, but if a person were to believe such doctrines only to the degree they seemed likely to be true, he or she would not be genuinely religious at all. Faith consists in a subjective relation of absolute commitment to these doctrines.|$|E
25|$|Something of Hampden's fame no <b>doubt</b> <b>is</b> {{owing to}} the {{position}} which he took up as the opponent of ship money. But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others {{as far as possible}} from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.|$|E
25|$|It was {{discovered}} that the settlement of Ladoga, whose foundation has been ascribed to Rurik, was actually established in the mid-9th century, although <b>doubt</b> <b>is</b> now cast on this by the dendrochronological evidence that Ladoga existed by the mid-8th century. Earthenware, household utensils, and types of buildings from the period of Rurik's purported foundation correspond to patterns then prevalent in Jutland. but mostly the excavations denied most of the chronicle's data about Rurik's arrival when {{it was apparent that}} the old settlement stretched to the mid-8th century and the excavated objects were mostly of Finno-Ugric and Slavic origin, dated to the mid-8th century, which showed the settlement was not Scandinavian from the beginning.|$|E

25|$|President Abdulla Yameen congratulated Trump on his victory. In his message, he said “I remain {{confident}} that the existing ties of friendship and cooperation between our two countries will continue and further strengthen under your able leadership. I also {{look forward to working}} with you not only to develop closer relations between our countries but also to concert on advancement of global interests common to our countries”. The President also said that he support Trump’s policy of “no-interference” on other countries affairs. He added “Today, America elected its new President. The strongest policy he has announced so far is to stop America’s efforts to meddle in global affairs. America needs to stop policing the entire world. This, without a <b>doubt,</b> <b>is</b> a very good principle”.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, Boston {{businessman}} and historian Charles Deane {{was the first}} scholar to question specific details of Smith's writings. Smith's version of events is the only source and skepticism has increasingly been expressed about its veracity. One reason for such <b>doubt</b> <b>is</b> that, despite having published two earlier books about Virginia, Smith's earliest-surviving account of his rescue by Pocahontas dates from 1616, nearly 10 years later, in a letter entreating Queen Anne to treat Pocahontas with dignity. The time gap in publishing his story {{raises the possibility that}} Smith may have exaggerated or invented the event to enhance Pocahontas' image. However, in a recent book, professor Leo Lemay of the University of Delaware points out that Smith's earlier writing was primarily geographical and ethnographic in nature and did not dwell on his personal experiences; hence, {{there was no reason for}} him to write down the story until this point.|$|E
25|$|Baudrillard is not disputing the trivial {{issue that}} reason remains {{operative}} in some actions, that if I want {{to arrive at}} the next block, for example, I can assume a Newtonian universe (common sense), plan a course of action (to walk straight for Xmeters), carry out the action, and finally fulfill my goal by arriving at the point in question. What is in <b>doubt</b> <b>is</b> that this sort of thinking enables a historically informed grasp of the present in general. According to Baudrillard, it does not. The concurrent spread of the hyperreal through the media and the collapse of liberal and Marxist politics as the master narratives, deprives the rational subject of its privileged access to truth. In an important sense individuals are no longer citizens, eager to maximise their civil rights, nor proletarians, anticipating the onset of communism. They are rather consumers, and hence the prey of objects as defined by the code.|$|E

25|$|In 1998 pollen {{found on}} the Shroud of Turin was {{analysed}} and with 29%, the pollen assigned to Gundelia was the most numerous. Such a high density makes it very unlikely that this would merely {{be the result of}} the Shroud having been exposed to the wind, particularly because Gundelia is an insect-pollinated, not a wind-pollinated plant. Some researchers have suggested this implies that the crown of thorns was made from Gundelia-branches. Other authors doubt the accuracy of the pollen analysis and of the process of gathering the pollen from the Shroud. One reason for <b>doubt</b> <b>is</b> that during the period that pollen is present in the plant, the thorns would have still been tender. It was suggested the pollen is from Helichrysum-species which have a similar type of pollen. Helichrysum was used in classical times to make crowns and garlands for the diseased because they do not wither and remain scented for a long time. An alternative explanation suggested is that rather more recent different flowers have been pressed against the Shroud to create contact relics, while in the process contaminating it with pollen and therefore diluting the original pollen signature.|$|E
