40|$|Background. Individuals {{infected}} with chikungunya virus (CHIKV) normally exhibit {{a variety of}} clinical man-ifestations during the acute phase of infection. However, studies in different patient cohorts have revealed that disease manifestations vary in frequency. Methods. Disease profiles between patients with acute CHIKV-infection and febrile patients without CHIKV were compared and examined to determine whether any clinical presentations {{were associated with the}} clinical out-come of CHIKV infection. Circulatory immune mediators profiles were then characterized and compared with data from 14 independent patient cohort studies. The particular <b>immune</b> <b>mediator</b> signature that defines acute CHIKV infection was determined. Results. Our findings revealed a specific pattern of clinical presentations of joint-specific arthralgia from this CHIKV cohort. More importantly, we identified an <b>immune</b> <b>mediator</b> signature dominated by proinflammatory cytokines, which include interferon α and γ and interleukin 2, 2 R, 6, 7, 12, 15, 17, and 18, across different patient cohorts of CHIKV load associated with arthralgia. Conclusions. To our knowledge, this is the first study that associated levels of CHIKV load with arthralgia as an indicator of acute CHIKV infection. Importantly, our findings also revealed specific <b>immune</b> <b>mediator</b> signatures {{that can be used to}} better define CHIKV infection...|$|E

High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1), an evolutionarily conserved chromosomal protein, was recently recognized to be a potent innate inflammatory mediator when released extracellularly.

40|$|Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is {{the major}} <b>immune</b> <b>mediator</b> that {{prevents}} toxoplasmic encephalitis in murine models. The lack of IFN-γ secretion causes reactivation of latent T. gondii infection that may confer a risk for severe toxoplasmic encephalitis. We analyse the effect of IFN-γ on <b>immune</b> <b>mediator</b> production and parasite multiplication in human nerve cells infected by tachyzoites of two T. gondii strains (RH and PRU). IFN-γ decreased the synthesis of MCP- 1, G-CSF, GM-CSF and Serpin E 1 in all cell types. It decreased IL- 6, migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and GROα synthesis only in endothelial cells, while it increased sICAM and Serpin E 1 synthesis only in neurons. The PRU strain burden increased in all nerve cells and in contrast, RH strain replication was controlled in IFN-γ-stimulated microglial and endothelial cells but not in IFN-γ-stimulated neurons. The proliferation of the PRU strain in all stimulated cells could be a specific effect of this strain on the host cell...|$|E

40|$|Environmental and {{lifestyle}} factors regulate the expression and release of <b>immune</b> <b>mediators.</b> It has been hypothesised that ambient air pollution may {{be such an}} external factor and that the association between air pollution and impaired glucose metabolism may be attributable to inflammatory processes. Therefore, we assessed the associations between air pollution, circulating <b>immune</b> <b>mediators</b> and impaired glucose metabolism.; We analysed concentrations of 14 pro- and anti-inflammatory <b>immune</b> <b>mediators</b> as well as fasting glucose and insulin levels in plasma of 363 women from the Study {{on the influence of}} Air pollution on Lung function, Inflammation and Aging (SALIA, Germany). Exposure data for a group of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NO 2, NOx) and different fractions of particulate matter were available for the participants' residences. We calculated the association between the pollutants and impaired glucose metabolism by multiple regression models.; The study participants had a mean age of 74. 1 (SD 2. 6) years and 48 % showed impaired glucose metabolism based on impaired fasting glucose or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Only long-term exposure NO 2 and NOx concentrations showed positive associations (NO 2 : OR 1. 465, 95 % CI 1. 049 - 2. 046, NOx: OR 1. 409, 95 % CI 1. 010 - 1. 967) per increased interquartile range of NO 2 (14. 65 µg/m(3)) or NOx (43. 16 µg/m(3)), respectively, but statistical significance was lost after correction for multiple comparisons. Additional adjustment for circulating <b>immune</b> <b>mediators</b> or the use of anti-inflammatory medication had hardly any impact on the observed ORs.; Our results suggest that exposure to nitrogen oxides may contribute to impaired glucose metabolism, but the associations did not reach statistical significance so that further studies with larger sample sizes are required to substantiate our findings. Our data do not preclude a role of inflammatory mechanisms in adipose or other tissues which may not be reflected by <b>immune</b> <b>mediators</b> in plasma...|$|R
40|$|The {{central nervous}} system is {{closely linked to the}} immune system at several levels. The brain {{parenchyma}} is separated from the periphery by the blood brain barrier, which under normal conditions prevents the entry of mediators such as activated leukocytes, antibodies, complement factors, and cytokines. The myeloid cell lineage plays {{a crucial role in the}} development of immune responses at the central level, and it comprises two main subtypes: (1) resident microglia, distributed throughout the brain parenchyma; (2) perivascular macrophages located in the brain capillaries of the basal lamina and the choroid plexus. In addition, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, endothelial cells, and, to a lesser extent, neurons are implicated in the immune response in the {{central nervous system}}. By modulating synaptogenesis, microglia are most specifically involved in restoring neuronal connectivity following injury. These cells release <b>immune</b> <b>mediators,</b> such as cytokines, that modulate synaptic transmission and that alter the morphology of dendritic spines during the inflammatory process following injury. Thus, the expression and release of <b>immune</b> <b>mediators</b> in the brain parenchyma are closely linked to plastic morphophysiological changes in neuronal dendritic spines. Based on these observations, it has been proposed that these <b>immune</b> <b>mediators</b> are also implicated in learning and memory processes...|$|R

40|$|Autoimmune {{diabetes}} {{is a complex}} disease in many respects. Complexity includes etiology and progression, the clinical picture, which differs between debut in childhood and adulthood, the association of autoimmune diabetes with other autoimmune diseases and the optimal treatment of the disease at a stage when insulin therapy is not necessary by clinical judgment. Reflecting these aspects of autoimmune diabetes {{the aim of this}} thesis was to provide relevant information on 1) circulating <b>immune</b> <b>mediators</b> in autoimmune diabetes and 2) the association of diabetes with autoimmune thyroid dysfunction. Lastly, 3) we provide data on a clinical trial which tests different treatments in patients with a subform of autoimmune disease diagnosed at adult age, called latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). - In paper I we measured prospectively circulating <b>immune</b> <b>mediators</b> in individuals with new onset autoimmune diabetes, {{with a mean age of}} 28 years. Baseline data were compared with those of age-matched non-diabetic controls. We find that circulating <b>immune</b> <b>mediators</b> were stable over time in adult-onset type 1 diabetes. Associations between different <b>immune</b> <b>mediators</b> were strikingly, but not exclusively, linked to autoimmune diabetes. Adipose mass, reflected by BMI, turned out to be a major confounder for associations of <b>immune</b> <b>mediators</b> with autoimmunity. - In paper II we analyzed data on diabetes and thyroid disorders out of data accessible from HUNT 2 and HUNT 3, i. e. from the two latest surveys of the HUNT Study. We found a strong association between autoimmune diabetes and increased prevalence of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Further, the increase in prevalence of hypo- and hyperthyroidism associated with autoimmune diabetes appeared gender neutral. On the other hand there was no clear association between type 2 diabetes and hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The lack of association contradicts the notion that increased surveillance of thyroid function is necessary in type 2 diabetes. - In paper III we analyzed baseline data from an ongoing study in LADA patients comparing early insulin vs. traditional peroral treatment, remaining beta cell function being the main outcome. In 44 patients randomized into the study we found that important baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the two randomized treatment groups. Further, the clinical profile of the study population seemed representative for a larger population. These findings appear favorable for eventually arriving at an unambiguous interpretation of the beta cell outcome variables...|$|R

40|$|Immunological {{programming}} of {{immune cells}} varies {{in response to}} changing environmental signals. This process is facilitated by modifiers that regulate the translational fate of mRNAs encoding various <b>immune</b> <b>mediators,</b> including cytokines and chemokines, which in turn determine the rapid activation, tolerance, and plasticity of the immune system. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) recruited by the specific sequence elements in mRNA transcripts are one such modifier. These RBPs form RBP-RNA complexes known as Riboclusters. These riboclusters serve as RNA sorting machinery, where depending upon {{the composition of the}} ribocluster, control translation, degradation or storage of mRNA. Recent findings suggest that this regulation of mRNA homeostasis is critical for controlling the immune response. Here, we present the current knowledge of the ribocluster-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of <b>immune</b> <b>mediators,</b> and highlight recent findings regarding their implications for the pathogenesis of acute or chronic inflammatory diseases...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} which cytokines and chemokines {{are involved}} in the immunopathogenesis of acute retinal necrosis (ARN), and whether cytokine profiles are associated with clinical manifestations, such as visual outcome. Methods: Serum and aqueous humor (AH) samples of 19 patients with ARN were analyzed by multiplex immunoassay. Infectious controls consisted of 18 patients with rubella virus-associated Fuchs' uveitis and 20 patients with ocular toxoplasmosis all confirmed by intraocular fluid analyses. The control group consisted of seven paired AH and serum samples from seven noninflammatory control patients with age-related cataract. In each sample, 4 anti-inflammatory, 12 proinflammatory, 2 vascular, and 4 other immune mediators were measured. In addition, various clinical characteristics were assessed. Results: In ARN, 10 of the 22 mediators, including most proinflammatory and vascular mediators such as IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 18, MIF, MCP- 1, Eotaxin, IP- 10, IL- 15, sICAM- 1, and sVCAM- 1, were significantly elevated when compared to all controls. In addition, one anti-inflammatory mediator (IL- 10) was significantly elevated in ARN as compared to the controls. No association was found between the time of sampling and the extent and levels of <b>immune</b> <b>mediator</b> expression. Conclusions: The pathogenesis of ARN is characterized by the presence of predominantly proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines with high expression levels as compared to other infectious causes of uveitis. There are no indications for an obvious Th- 1 or Th- 17 pathway. The combined data suggest that <b>immune</b> <b>mediator</b> expression is related to severity of disease, which is more fulminant in ARN, rather than to a specific uveitis entity...|$|E

The factor that recruits Ia-positive macrophages must be injected several times during a 2 -d period for optimal demonstration of its activity. The induction of the factor is immunologically specific and requires Ia-positive macrophages, primed T lymphocytes, and antigen challenge.
