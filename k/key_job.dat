Villepin's flawed advice on the election increased the perception among many politicians on the right that Villepin had no experience or understanding of grassroots politics, and owed his enviable position only to being Chirac's protégé.|$|E

Samarina's had basically three workers; an additional worker was needed when the zveno switched to work involving sowing.

40|$|This {{research}} paper investigated {{the role of}} the modern CIO in terms of their <b>key</b> <b>job</b> functions and critical capabilities and competencies which are required in order for the CIO to achieve superior organizational performance for the current and future business environment.

The findings of this research lends support to five <b>key</b> <b>job</b> functions and eighteen critical competencies which we believe are essential for the role of the CIO in current and future business environment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the extent superintendents in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming relied on (a) prior administrative experiences, (b) network of colleagues, (c) professional and governmental organizations, (d) academic preparation, and (e) research to effectively complete <b>key</b> <b>job</b> responsibilities. For this study, the <b>key</b> <b>job</b> responsibilities were the eight standards identified by the American Association of School Administrators Commission on Standards for the Superintendency, chaired by John Hoyle, completed in 1993. The eight standards identified were: leadership and district culture, policy and governance, communications and community relations, organizational management, curriculum planning and development, instructional management, human resources management, and values and ethics of leadership. A total of 207 superintendents with at least three but not more than five years of experience were included in the study. ^ The findings associated with the research questions revealed that superintendents relied on prior administrative experiences significantly more than any of the other four variables to complete each <b>key</b> <b>job</b> responsibility. When all eight <b>key</b> <b>job</b> responsibilities were considered as a whole, prior administrative experiences were relied on significantly more than any other variable. Network of colleagues were relied on significantly more than professional and governmental organizations, research, and academic preparation.

40|$|In {{the last}} ten years there has been {{increasing}} concern about the drop in numbers of experienced British merchant ship officers. This short fall in manpower will have serious repercussions on the recruitment strategy of United Kingdom shore-based shipping support organisations. These employers have relied upon a supply of former ships' officers to recruit into various <b>key</b> <b>jobs.</b> Research has shown that demand is expected to exceed suppy, and there has been much debate concerning a solution to the problem. This thesis is an analysis of the shore-side maritime industry's recruitment strategy in the light of this forecast shortage of experienced ships' officers. It aims to make a substantial conribution to the debate concerning recruitment pre-requisites into the industry and increase understanding of the reasons why employers prefer to recruit former ships' officers. There are two 'strands' in this thesis. First of all this work provides a broad, qualitative analysis of the situation. It focuses upon the recruitment of seafarers into the shore-based maritime industry, the supply of and demand for seafarers and the reasons for their decline in numbers. The work uses data that has been generated on the maritime labour market to argue that the industry needs to train non-seafarers for certain <b>key</b> <b>jobs</b> instead of recruiting former officers. Theories and concepts originating from experts on skill shortages are used to show that the industry is unlikely to react in time to the shortage to prevent wider damage to the UK's maritime sector. Therefore this work supports the idea that non-seafarer training schemes are feasible for some types of work, and also need to be supported by the State in order to preserve the pool of experienced officers. Secondly, the arguments put forward by employers and employee bodies areanalysed to ascertain why they believe it is necessary that former seafarers have to be employed to carry out certain <b>key</b> <b>jobs.</b> This work also argues that there are other reasons besides those given as to why employers do not see the training of non-seafarers as a good alternative. The situation in the industry is tested against two models of 'professional power'. A new model of professionalism was created in order to develop understanding of how and why maritime occupational groups try to exclude non-seafarers from shore-based marine related work. It concluded that there is a mobilisation of bias within the sector against non-seafarers entering an industry that predominantly favours of those who have ships' officer experienc...|$|R

This paper examines whether this job has become harder and, to the extent that it has, what changes in the inflation process have made it so. The main finding is that the univariate inflation process is well described by an unobserved component trend-cycle model with stochastic volatility or, equivalently, an integrated moving average process with time-varying parameters; this model explains a variety of recent univariate inflation forecasting puzzles. It appears currently to be difficult for multivariate forecasts to improve on forecasts made using this time-varying univariate model. ...|$|E
