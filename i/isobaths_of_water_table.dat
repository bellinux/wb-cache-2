In this research, the effects <b>of</b> different <b>water</b> <b>table</b> depths and salinity of groundwater on contribution of groundwater to evapotranspiration of safflower were studied. The treatments were four levels <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> depth (50, 70, 90, and 120 cm), two levels of groundwater salinity (EC of 0. 6, and 10 dSm- 1), and two irrigation regimes (irrigation with a depth <b>of</b> <b>water</b> equal to 75 percent <b>of</b> evaporation from <b>water</b> surface and frequency of 5 days, and no irrigation). The experiment was performed in a randomized complete block design with treatment combinations arranged in factorial manner and three replications. For fixing the <b>water</b> <b>table</b> in the pots (PVC pipe 200 mm in diameter and 120 cm high), a special equipment was built on the principle of Marriot bottle that was able to measure the contribution of groundwater to evapotranspiration of the plants. Results showed that salinity of groundwater, irrigation regime, and their interactions have significant effects on evapotranspiration of safflower. In addition, effects <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> depth, salinity <b>of</b> groundwater, irrigation regime, interaction <b>of</b> salinity and <b>water</b> <b>table</b> depth, interaction <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> depth and irrigation regime, and interaction <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> depth, salinity, and irrigation regime on evaporation from soil surface were significant.

The ratio of evaporation from soil surface and evapotranspiration was in the range of 4. 5 to 53. 6 % for different treatments. In all treatments of groundwater depths, irrigation treatment significantly decreased evapotranspiration, but no significant change in evapotranspiration was observed in irrigated and no irrigated treatments. Maximum amount of evapotranspiration (251 cm) occurred in the 50 cm depth of groundwater with salinity of 0. 6 dS/m under irrigated condition, and minimum amount (43. 9 cm) occurred in the 90 cm depth to groundwater with salinity of 10 dS/m under no irrigation condition.

40|$|It is very {{important}} to study applications of unsaturated soil properties in slope stability analysis due to the additional shear strength an unsaturated soil possesses. Shear strength of an unsaturated soil is strongly related to the amount <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in the voids of the soil, and therefore to the matric suction. It is postulated that the shear strength of an unsaturated soil should also bear a relationship to the soil-water characteristic curve. In this thesis, the effect of unsaturated shear strength properties on stability of slopes is investigated by analysing for the stability of hypothetical cut slopes. The effect of the position <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> below the failure surface of hypothetical cut slopes were analysed using Slope/w software for different <b>water</b> <b>table</b> positions for three different cut slope angles.

Predictions <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> response, however, commonly assume a linear relationship between response and rainfall based on cumulative analysis <b>of</b> <b>water</b> level and rainfall logs. By identifying individual rainfall events and responses, we examine how the response/rainfall ratio varies as a function <b>of</b> antecedent <b>water</b> <b>table</b> level (stage) and rainfall event size. For wells in wetlands and uplands in central Florida, incorporating stage and event size improves forecasting <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> rise by more than 30 %, based on 10 years of data.
