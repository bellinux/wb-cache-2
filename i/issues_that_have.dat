25|$|The {{lines of}} even this test can blur, however, when {{differences}} that arise are {{not due to}} doctrine, but to recognition of jurisdiction.

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the crisis two {{solutions}} have been proposed. One, repeatedly supported over the long term by the GAO and others is to consolidate the U.S. financial industry regulators.

25|$|Saudi Arabia {{is widely}} {{accused of having}} one of the worst human rights records in the world.

Between 1996 and 2000, Saudi Arabia acceded to four UN human rights conventions and, in 2004, the government approved the establishment of the National Society for Human Rights (NSHR), staffed by government employees, to monitor their implementation. To date, the activities of the NSHR have been limited and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence.|$|E
25|$|Around a {{year after}} alcohol {{restrictions}} in the Valley came into place, in October 2008, a community meeting led by the MWRC and Nindilingarri Cultural Health Services gathered to talk about FASD and other problems related to alcohol.

ELT is a term that defines <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> a negative influence on a child’s development, such as poor nutrition, neglect, stress and violence. In November 2008, Oscar jointly developed a draft strategy to fight these issues titled Overcoming Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and Early Life Trauma (ELT) in the Fitzroy Valley: a community initiative.|$|E

25|$|One {{of several}} <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> {{risen from the}} {{controversy}} {{is the issue of}} blood lineage and government records in regards to determining tribal membership. Historians have noted that before the Dawes Commission, the Cherokee have included people from previous rolls and people of non-Cherokee descent as members of the nation, from former captives to members by adoption. The Delaware and Shawnee tribes, two non-Cherokee tribes, are members of the Cherokee Nation via the Delaware Agreement of 1867 and the Shawnee Agreement of 1869. Another issue is that of a tribe's breaking a treaty protected by Article Six of the United States Constitution. Daniel F. Littlefield Jr., director of the Sequoyah Research Center at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock, stated that the Treaty of 1866 granted freedmen their rights as citizens, and the case should not be made into a racial issue.|$|E
