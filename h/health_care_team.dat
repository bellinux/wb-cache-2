40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to explore the extent of teamworking in primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in the UK and compare primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> with other multidisciplinary teams on fundamental critieria of team functioning. A survey was conducted, using a validated questionnaire which measures four aspects of team climate: participation, shared objectives, task orientation and support for innovation. Sixty-eight primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> participated in the questionnaire survey, with additional comparison data from: 24 oil company teams; 27 NHS management teams; 20 community mental health teams; 40 social services teams. The total number of respondents across three samples was 1, 555. Main outcome measures were levels of team participation, support for innovation, task orientation and clarity of, and commitment to, <b>team</b> objectives. Primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> scored significantly lower than other teams in the sample on all team functioning factors except task orientation. It is concluded that a restructuring of the organization of primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> is required if primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> are to develop clear shared objectives to facilitate the coordinated approach to the delivery of care, long urged by practitioners and policy makers...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Community Health Workers (CHWs) {{serve as}} a means of {{improving}} outcomes for underserved populations. However, their relationship within <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> is not well studied. The purpose of this integrative review was to examine published research reports that demonstrated positive health outcomes as a result of CHW intervention to identify interprofessional teamwork and collaboration between CHWs and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams.</b> Methods: A total of 47 studies spanning 33 years were reviewed using an integrative literature review methodology for evidence to support the following assumptions of effective interprofessional teamwork between CHWs and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> teams: (1) shared understanding of roles, norms, values, and goals of the team; (2) egalitarianism; (3) cooperation; (4) interdependence; and(5) synergy. Results: Of the 47 studies, 12 reported at least one assumption of effective interprofessional teamwork. Four studies demonstrated all 5 assumptions of interprofessional teamwork. Conclusions: Four studies identified in this integrative review serve as exemplars for effective interprofessional teamwork between CHWs and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams.</b> Further study is needed to describe the nature of interprofessional teamwork and collaboration in relation to patient health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|As part of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams,</b> {{community}} <b>health</b> workers (CHWs) can {{be valuable}} resources {{for increasing the}} effectiveness of public health practitioners. CHWs {{are members of the}} community who serve as advocates and liaisons between the community and the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and social service systems. They provide services that improve <b>health</b> <b>care</b> access and education to promote understanding of health problems and how to navigate the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system. CHWs can provide informal counseling and perform minor clinical services, such as checking blood pressure in nonclinical settings. They can translate and promote understanding when patients receive health services. By integrating CHWs into <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams,</b> public <b>health</b> practitioners can better address health inequities in underserved communities where CHWs provide services. This brief examines how CHWs can help address rising <b>health</b> <b>care</b> costs and poor health among underserved communities. It provides a detailed description of CHWs, their work settings, and the services that they provide. It offers guidance on how public health practitioners can collaborate with CHWs to enhance the coordination of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and advance <b>health</b> equity.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explores how roles are constructed within interprofessional <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams.</b> It focuses on elucidating {{the different types}} of role boundaries, the influences on role construction and the implications for professionals and patients. A comparative case study was conducted with two interprofessional primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams.</b> The data collection included a total of 26 interviews (13 with each team) and non-participant observations of team meetings (2 - 3 meetings at each site). Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data and a model was developed to represent the emergent findings. The role boundaries are organized around interprofessional interactions (autonomous-collaborative boundaries) and the distribution of tasks (interchangeable-differentiated boundaries). Salient influences are categorized as structural, interpersonal and individual dynamics. The implications of role construction include professional satisfaction and more favourable wait times for patients. The elements in this conceptual model may be transferable to other interprofessional primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams.</b> It may benefit these teams by raising awareness of the potential impact of various within-team influences on role construction. ...|$|R
25|$|For the {{provision}} of primary care, Spain is currently divided geographically in basic health care areas (áreas básicas de salud), each one containing a primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>team</b> (Equipo de atención primaria). Each team is multidisciplinary and typically includes GPs, community pediatricians, nurses, physiotherapists and social workers, together with ancillary staff. In urban areas all the services are concentrated in a single large building (Centro de salud) while in rural areas the main center is supported by smaller branches (consultorios), typically single-handled.|$|E

40|$|Teams are a {{significant}} tool for promoting and managing change.

These changes have clarified the necessity for sensitivity by psychogeriatric services to the needs of GPs and commissioning authorities. The number of consultant psychogeriatricians has grown rapidly in the past 20 years from a handful in the early 1970 s to over 350 in 1991.

In this study we tested a previously developed pro-gramme theory on 15 primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> center <b>teams</b> located in four different Spanish regions: Murcia, C Valenciana, Castilla-León and Cantabria.

40|$|The {{relationships}} among leadership clarity (i. e., team members' consensual perceptions of clarity of and no conflict over leadership of their teams), team processes, and innovation {{were examined in}} <b>health</b> <b>care</b> contexts. The sample comprised 3447 respondents from 98 primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> (PHCTs), 113 community mental health teams (CMHTs), and 72 breast cancer <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> (BCTs). The results revealed that leadership clarity is associated with clear team objectives, high levels of participation, commitment to excellence, and support for innovation. Team processes consistently predicted team innovation across all three samples. Team leadership predicted innovation in the latter two samples, {{and there was some}} evidence that team processes partly mediated this relationship. The results imply the need for theory that incorporates clarity and not just style of leadership. For <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> in particular, and teams in general, the results suggest a need to ensure leadership is clear in teams when innovation is a desirable team performance outcome. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} {{a review of the}} {{conflict}} literature. It continues with an illustration of the nature of intergroup conflict between British <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams,</b> by presenting results from an interview study using the critical incident technique. Within the theory testing part, drawing upon a sample of 53 British <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>teams</b> from five organisations, an empirical test of both intergroup contact and social identity theory is provided. In a next step, a measure of intergroup effectiveness, the effectiveness with which dyads of groups perform on collaborative tasks, is developed. Finally, the moderating role of both resource interdependence and group boundary spanners’ negotiation style for the relationship between intergroup competition and longitudinal change in group and intergroup effectiveness is examined.
