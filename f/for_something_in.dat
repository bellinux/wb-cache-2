500|$|The forest set was {{constructed}} on stage 12 at the Paramount Studios lot, and {{was designed by}} production designer Richard James. Backdrops were used to expand {{the depth of the}} stage. Marvin V. Rush later explained that they were not aiming for a real world forest look to the scenes, as the story allowed them to aim <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the [...] "in mythology and in historical record" [...] instead. He attributed this for why the scenery design and creation was successful. Director Les Landau also found that it enabled him to use some different camera angles in [...] "Heroes and Demons", including shooting from a crane and the use of close-focus lenses to enable some wide shooting {{to get a sense of}} depth.|$|E
500|$|The novel's {{tone and}} {{structure}} place {{it within the}} serious literary tradition for which Kostova was aiming. For example, the alternating timelines are suggestive of A. S. Byatt's Possession (1990) and the intermingling of academia and the occult suggests Arturo Perez-Reverte's The Club Dumas (1993). Although many reviewers compared The Historian to Dan Brown's historical thriller The Da Vinci Code (2003), Kostova has said her book [...] "is part of a tradition where literary craft and experiments in form are all as important as action...the only overlap is this idea of people searching <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> history. I'm still surprised when people make this comparison, I'm very grateful my publisher has never pushed it." [...] Moreover, the only real historical personage in her novel is Vlad Țepeș and she changed the name of some locations [...] "fearing some readers might confuse fantasy and reality, as they have with Brown's novels".|$|E

2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} reissued {{its debut}} studio album, Queens of the Stone Age (1998), in 2011, and embarked upon an extensive tour playing the album in full each night. Homme stated, [...] "Doing the rehearsals {{for the first}} record is really defining the new one. It's been turning the new record into something else. What we were doing was kind of bluesy, and now it's turned into this trancey, broken thing. The robots are back!" [...] However, in 2013, Homme noted, [...] "I was hoping that playing the first record would really inspire me and make me {{fall in love with}} music again.

2500|$|While {{similarities}} between the Visitors and the Obama and Bush administrations have been discussed in the media, Peters refuted that they were intentional. He has stated that {{the theme of the}} show is [...] "blind devotion", with no political or religious agenda. Peters commented: [...] "Watching any television show is a subjective experience. If you're looking <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> a show, you can find it, whether you're {{on one side of the}} political spectrum or the other. The central theme of this show is blind devotion, and you can look at that in two different ways. It's our job, as storytellers, to put some provocative things out there and leave some things open to interpretation." [...] Bell added: [...] "We're talking about metaphors and allegories here. On a certain level, I just want to remind people it's a show about spaceships." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} Jewish {{religious}} practice has included cult images and figurines made of ivory, terracotta, faience and seals. As more material evidence emerged, one proposal {{has been that}} Judaism oscillated between idolatry and iconoclasm. However, the dating of the objects and texts suggest that the two theologies and liturgical practices existed simultaneously. The claimed rejection of idolatry because of monotheism found in Jewish literature and therefrom in biblical Christian literature, states Janowitz, has been unreal abstraction and flawed construction of the actual history. The material evidence of images, statues and figurines taken together with the textual description of cherub and [...] "wine standing for blood", for example, suggests that symbolism, making religious images, icon and index has been integral part of Judaism. Every religion has some objects that represent the divine and stand <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> {{the mind of the}} faithful, and Judaism too has had its holy objects and symbols such as the Menorah.|$|E

2500|$|Georgian {{soldiers}} told EurasiaNet {{that they}} thought their initial mission in South Ossetia was to stop attacks on Georgian villages. One senior lieutenant from 4th Brigade said: [...] "Our goal was {{to put an end}} to fighting in the area and take control. Nobody in the army expected a war with Russia." [...] One unnamed Georgian defense ministry source said: [...] "The main thing is that the scope of the threat was underestimated, while our own combat capabilities were overestimated." [...] Georgian military sources said that an attack had earlier been expected from Abkhazia, but not from South Ossetia. The 4th Brigade senior lieutenant said that they [...] "were preparing <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> May when Georgia was denied NATO membership ," [...] but there [...] "were no preparations made" [...] for a military operation in South Ossetia in August. [...] "Many were on vacation and we were preparing to go Iraq in the fall." ...|$|E
2500|$|Byers‐Heinlein & Werker (2009) studied 48 17 and 18-month-old {{monolingual}} (English), bilingual, and trilingual (22 diverse languages) infants {{to compare}} their patterns on disambiguation. They studied infants {{at this age}} because this is when the heuristic {{has been shown to}} appear in monolingual infants. Additionally, they studied bilinguals from multiple diverse language backgrounds to show that the patterns were not language-specific but rather characteristic of bilingualism in general. they found that monolinguals showed disambiguation, bilinguals somewhat, and trilinguals did not. Byers‐Heinlein & Werker (2009) hypothesized that this was particularly an effect of translation equivalents (knowing the name <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> more than one language), as [...] "they represent a departure from the one-to-one mapping between word and concept that is typical of monolingual vocabularies" [...] (p 820). Indeed, in a later study conducted by Byers-Heinlein & Werker (2013) in 17–18 month-old Chinese-English bilingual infants, results showed that disambiguation did not occur in the infants who [...] "understood the translation equivalents {{for more than half of}} the words in their vocabularies" [...] (p.407), while disambiguation occurred in those who knew fewer translation equivalents. They also suggested that the reverse could be possible—that infants who employed the heuristic were the ones that did acquire the translation equivalents because of the high level of one-to-one mapping. also say that disambiguation and language exposure are not correlated, but the presence or absence of translation equivalents could be attributed by the amount of exposure in each language the child gets. Particularly, if children receive more exposure in both languages, they are likely to have both words for a given object or concept, but if they have less exposure in one language they will likely lack the appropriate amount of translation equivalents, thereby exhibiting disambiguation.|$|E
