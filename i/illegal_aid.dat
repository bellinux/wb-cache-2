5000|$|Ironically, the U of I {{began the}} {{investigation}} into the [...] "slush-fund" [...] as a good faith gesture to demonstrate to the Big Ten commissioners that {{they would be willing to}} handle any negative consequences in-house.

It also found that 17 other athletes had received aid since 1962, totaling approximately $21,500. The salt in the wound came from Big Ten commissioner Bill Reed, who emphasized that, even though the university had completed its investigation and dismissed the parties involved, the conference would continue the investigation further and hand down a formal decision on March 4, 1967. The decision, after a fairly brief debate, made by the conference athletic directors, including ex-offenders Biggie Munn and Forest Evashevski, called for Illinois to fire Elliott, Combes and Braun or [...] "show cause" [...] why the university should not be suspended or dropped from Big Ten membership. Based on the fact that the committee making the decision was made up of several members who had been guilty of infractions themselves, President Henry became outraged. The University appealed the decision, meanwhile, [...] "friends of the coaches" [...] began circulating petitions with hopes of pressuring the school into keeping them regardless of the consequences. On March 18, the Big Ten issued its final ultimatum to the University of Illinois. In a statement from the commissioner, it was demanded that the implicated coaches be fired or the school could face an indefinite suspension. When the dust settled, football coach Pete Elliott and basketball coaches Combes and Braun all had their existing contracts terminated on August 31, 1967.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{problem of}} the cases of Soribada and Winny is their duplexity {{that they could be}} used legally and illegally. The issue called 'The crime of aiding through the neutral {{behavior}} ' is about whether the program developer who shared the file sharing program letting unspecified public infringe the copyright could be punished or not. Many theories about limiting the traditional scope of punishment of aider have been maintained. However, it is questionable whether it is possible to limit the scope of punishment following the former cases and theories even for the action that is causal and facilitates the principal's criminal conduct, like the aid through the neutral action which is hard to perceive as <b>illegal</b> <b>aid</b> because of its characteristics. Therefore, using the case of Soribada in Korea and the case of Winny in Japan as the examples of <b>illegal</b> <b>aid</b> through neutral behavior case, this paper examines the characteristics and problems of aid through existing theories and cases, and suggests new scope of punishment limitation standard through the elaboration of the action of aid and judgment of degree...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the economic significance of state aid {{and the main}} principles of European state aid control. It starts with a definition of state aid in European context and exceptions to the general ban of state aid. Then they are explored the motives for granting state aid, ranging from the correction of market failures over political motives to political economy considerations. They are described some procedures and coordination of granting state aid, then how state aid control fits into the framework of European competition policy before we comment extensively on the more economic approach to state aid control, as implemented by the European Commission, and the state aid action plan. Control of state aid is of increasing importance {{in the context of}} European competition policy in order to maintain a fair level of activity of all enterprises participating in the European markets, regardless of the Member State in which they reside. The theoretical fundamentals of state aid are important to be studied and applied. Were distinguished and described the main approaches in the evolution of economic theories in the field of State aid. Criteria were established to determine the government's actions as state aid and intervention methods analyzed. It is important to think about the implications of state aid at an early stage. Doing so allows assistance to be designed and given more quickly and effectively and avoids potential problems later. A program of assistance that does not follow the rules could be forced to close. Giving state aid illegally could result in the money having to be clawed back with possibly very serious consequences for the recipient. The European Commission monitors and controls state aid in the EU by requiring member states to notify the Commission in advance of proposed state aid in order to ensure compliance. If a European company believes that a competitor is receiving <b>illegal</b> <b>aid</b> then they should complain directly to the Commission on the complaints form. The Commission is obliged under the Procedural Regulation to act on any evidence of potential <b>illegal</b> <b>aid</b> and will therefore take complaints seriously, but all these aspects are described in the present research...|$|E

40|$|This {{third and}} final article in the series {{discusses}} in more detail BEPS Actions 7 and 15, which have particular relevance to the digital economy. It examines the steps that New Zealand and other OECD jurisdictions are taking to implement these particular recommendations dealing, respectively, with artificial avoidance of permanent establishment (PE) status {{and the development of}} a multilateral instrument to modify bilateral tax treaties. The article also tries to place Actions 7 and 15 within the context of a recent and intensifying global discussion on the ability of taxing jurisdictions to address perceived revenue leakage from large corporations that have benefited from, or are leading players in, the rise of the Internet. The simplified issue of the amount of tax that some corporations actually pay has obscured to some extent the specific work being undertaken by the OECD and its member jurisdictions to implement, individually and collectively, BEPS measures addressing the tax challenges of the digital economy. The most recent and significant example of this action—in relation to large players in the digital world—occurred in August 2016 when the European Commission (EC) announced its finding that Ireland had granted illegal (under EU rules) tax benefits of up to [euro] 13 billion to Apple, such that Apple paid an effective corporate tax rate of between 0. 005 percent and 1. 0 percent on its European profits between 2003 and 2014. The EC’s determination that Ireland must now recover the <b>illegal</b> <b>aid</b> (equivalent to USD 14. 5 billion) from Apple has fuelled further discussion among governments and commentators about the relationship between such a determination (or tax legislation) and ongoing work by the OECD. It remains to be seen whether a global or multilateral approach to address the action points in the OECD BEPS reports will ultimately prevail over a revenue-salvaging approach by individual jurisdictions...|$|E

40|$|The {{member states}} of the European Union grant {{subsidies}} for various reasons. The purpose of such State aid can be economic and social {{as well as political}} and strategic. It can correct market failures by, for example, supporting research and development as well as investment in environmental technology. At the same time however, EC law has indeed a strict view on the granting of subsidies, since it may affect the competition through out the union in a negative way and thus distort the common market. Member states are therefore obliged to notify the Commission and await its examination of the proposed aid measure before putting it into action. And before approving a measure, the Commission thoroughly examines its compatibility with the Common market. However, while the tasks of examining State aid measures and deciding whether they are to be approved or not, or recovered or not, are placed upon the Commission, the recovery of unlawful and <b>illegal</b> State <b>aids</b> is to be carried out by the national courts, in accordance with national procedures. And as a consequence to the frequent slowness and sometimes lack of such procedures, the recovery of <b>illegal</b> State <b>aids</b> and the enforcement of State aid rules, have repeatedly been on the Commission’s agenda. In addition, changes have been made within the procedure of the Commission’s examination of potential State aid measures, where additional exemptions to the obligation to notify under Article 88 (3) EC Treaty have been approved. By this, the examination in these exempted areas has been replaced by conditions in secondary EC law and the Commission’s soft law. And as a consequence, the position of the beneficiary seems to have been weakened. The purpose of this thesis is, in general, to provide a picture of the situation of the beneficiaries during the examination and recovery procedure under EC law, and in particular, to examine on what grounds a recipient undertaking of unlawful or <b>illegal</b> State <b>aid,</b> believed to be lawful and legal, can be protected from recovery by the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations. It provides, in other words, an examination and analysis of the different sources that may create legitimate expectations. And since such expectations merely can be entertained when contrary to a general principle of community law or when exceptional circumstances prevail, this thesis also provides a picture of in which context such claims can be successfully invoked. Last but not least, the above mentioned changes of the State aid field possess indeed a potential of affecting the position of the beneficiary and thus the notion of legitimate expectations. Therefore, this report also examines in what way and to what extent that may be the case...|$|R
