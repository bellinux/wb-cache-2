5|$|Coffee shop {{employees}} {{who witnessed the}} shooting identified Clemmons as the shooter {{from a series of}} photos. Authorities sought him in what was considered one of the biggest manhunts the Seattle-Tacoma area had ever seen, and Clemmons was considered the most wanted man in the Pacific Northwest. Authorities also surrounded the homes of Clemmons' friends and family in order to prevent him from finding shelter, and to determine who was helping him. A relative learned that Clemmons was coming to her home in the Leschi neighborhood in Seattle, informed the police and fled. Police locked down the house for 11 hours in the early morning of November 30, believing Clemmons to be holed up inside. After several attempts to coax or force <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> including use of a robot and flashbang grenades, police entered and discovered Clemmons was not inside. Later that day, police searched multiple locations in the Seattle and Tacoma areas, including a park where they found a handgun carried by Clemmons and his pickup truck, which had blood stains inside.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1957, Stompanato visited Turner in England, where she was filming Another Time, Another Place (1958), co-starring Sean Connery. In her autobiography, Turner said that she {{arranged}} for Stompanato's visit because she was lonely and having a difficult time filming. Their reunion was initially happy, but the two soon began fighting. Stompanato became suspicious when Turner would not allow him to visit the set and, during one fight, he choked her, causing her to miss three weeks of filming. Turner later wrote {{that she and her}} makeup man, Del Armstrong, called Scotland Yard in order to have Stompanato deported. Stompanato got wind of the plan and showed up on the set with a gun, threatening her and her co-star Sean Connery, whom he warned to keep away from Turner. Connery answered by grabbing the gun out of Stompanato's hand and twisting his wrist, causing him to run off the set sheepishly. Turner and Armstrong later returned with two Scotland Yard detectives to the rented house where she and Stompanato were staying. The detectives advised Stompanato to leave and escorted <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and also to the airport, where he boarded a plane back to the United States.|$|E

500|$|Marge is {{generally}} a stereotypical sitcom mother, {{and she also}} plays the [...] "long-suffering wife" [...] who puts up with the antics of her children and her oafish husband. While she usually takes her family's problems with good humor, in [...] "Homer Alone" [...] (season three, 1992), her workload and resultant stress caused her to have a mental breakdown. After spending time at [...] "Rancho Relaxo", during which her family barely coped with her absence, she returned refreshed and everyone promised to help out more often. Marge often provides a grounding opinion for Homer and their marriage has often been shaky. Marge admits that she [...] "put {{up with a lot}} in [...] marriage," [...] and has left Homer or thrown <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> on several occasions. One of the first such episodes to depict this is [...] "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" [...] (season five, 1994), where Homer starts teaching an adult education class on how to build a successful marriage. He is at first unsuccessful, but gains the interest of the class when he starts giving away family secrets, many of which concern Marge. Upon finding this out, Marge is incensed and throws <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The next day, Homer is dirty and disheveled, and begs Marge to take him back, saying the one thing he can offer her that nobody else can is [...] "complete and utter dependence." [...] At first, Marge does not see that as a benefit, but eventually admits that he [...] "really [...] make a gal feel needed." [...] Episodes that depict marital problems have become more frequent in recent seasons of the show. Through it all, Marge has remained faithful to Homer, despite temptations to the contrary such as the one in [...] "Life on the Fast Lane" [...] (season one, 1990), where she resists the charming Frenchman Jacques and instead chooses to remain with Homer.|$|E
500|$|The subplot with Stan getting beat up by {{his sister}} Shelley came from Parker's real-life {{experiences}} getting beat up as a child by his sister, also named Shelley, who is three years his elder. Parker said although his sister would later deny it, she regularly beat him up or locked <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> for hours; Parker stated that the scene when Stan says [...] "You're my sister and I love you" [...] {{in order to try}} to avoid a beating, but was subsequently beat even harder, was based on an actual experience with his sister. The scene in which Stan asks the giant mutant Stan to attack Shelley is based on Parker's childhood fantasy of having a larger version of himself beat up his sister. The resolution to the subplot, in which Shelley takes the blame for Stan's mistakes, and then beats up Stan when he tries to thank her, was also based on experiences Parker had when his sister would bail him out of trouble.|$|E

[...] Under cover of the fight, the rabbits rescue the baby rabbits. The tale was influenced by the Uncle Remus stories, and was set in the fields of Potter's Castle Farm.
