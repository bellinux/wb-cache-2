40|$|Business-to-business {{electronic}} contracts {{provide a}} specification of the agreed value exchange and guarantee legal protection to companies during electronic trading relations. Important features that distinguish e-contracts from traditional paper contracts are {{the possibilities for}} automatic establishment and enactment, the more detailed <b>e-contract</b> content specification {{and the frequency of}} <b>e-contract</b> content updating. In this paper, we discuss these <b>e-contract</b> features and the technology requirements to which they lead. We describe two conceptual architectures for the support of updates in digitally signed e-contracts. We demonstrate that the straightforward approach is inefficient and therefore inadequate for supporting high update rates in an automated, dynamic, communication-intensive contract enactment environment. The second approach that we describe allows companies to handle <b>e-contract</b> updates in a more efficient and simplified manner. It introduces a new type of Trusted Third Party {{that can be used for}} the support of <b>e-contract</b> updates.

40|$|Electronic {{contracts}} are the instrument to govern electronic trading relationships between business parties. A number of efforts exist {{in both the}} academic and industrial worlds to define an <b>e-contract</b> specification language. However, these efforts lack either universality or completeness. The main reasons for this are the complexity and diversity of business contracts. For {{the definition of a}} common, complete <b>e-contract</b> specification language, the identification of requirements on an <b>e-contract</b> language is an underlying prerequisite. In this paper, we present the requirements on an <b>e-contract</b> specification language. The identified requirements are based on the investigation of traditional business contracts from different business domains (business pull aspects), the technology aspects of e-contracts (technology push aspects), and the existing research efforts on this topic (research aspects).

In this environment, e-commerce has become a dominant factor in commercial transactions and business arrangements. This is a multimedia environment encompassing borderless, intangible, faceless and metaphysical world that defies traditional concepts of space and time. It converges computing, broadcasting and telecommunication with interactive capabilities. Along with the cross-border communication and global economy, is the arising of legal issue such as <b>e-contract,</b> that is, contracts entered into by parties via the digital networks. This paper is {{a study of the}} role of legislative implementation, in particular, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) in regulating <b>e-contract</b> in the emerging e-commerce. The realm of <b>e-contract</b> specifies the contracting parties dealing in a cyberspace situation. The circumstances surrounding on-line agreement (or <b>e-contract)</b> vary vastly to the paper-based contract function, which sometimes become a barrier to e-commerce transactions. The UNCITRAL is set up to harmonise legal contracting issues arising from contracts entered via electronics medium. Thus, this study is essential in this unchained globalisation environment.

40|$|In an e-service environment, {{contracts}} {{are important for}} attaining business process interoperability and enforcing their proper enactment. An <b>e-contract</b> is the computerized facilitation or automation of a contract in a crossorganizational business process.

This problem is challenging as it involves monitoring the enactment of business processes in counter parties outside an organization's boundary.

In the document layer, {{contracts are}} composed of different types of clauses.
