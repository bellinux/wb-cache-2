Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room.

25|$|They don't respect {{our culture}} because we didn't give {{permission}} {{for someone to}} carve the sacred Black Hills where our burial grounds are. They were there for us to enjoy and they were there for us to pray. But it wasn't meant to be carved into images, which is very wrong for all of us.

25|$|In linguistics, wh-movement (also {{known as}} wh-fronting or wh-extraction or long-distance dependency) {{concerns}} special rules of syntax—rules observed in many languages around the world—involving {{the placement of}} interrogative words. The special interrogatives, whatever the language, are known within linguistics as wh-words (so named because most interrogative words in the English language start with a wh-; for example, who(m), whose, what, which, etc.). Wh-words are used to form questions, and can also occur in relative clauses. In languages exhibiting wh-movement, sentences or clauses containing a wh-word show a special word order that has the wh-word (or phrase containing the wh-word) appearing {{at the front of}} the sentence or clause, e.g. Who do you think about?, instead of in a more canonical position further to the right, e.g. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> you. The opposite is called wh in situ.|$|E

[...] African-American literature professor Priscilla R. Ramsey, when analyzing the poem [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> Myself," [...] states that the first-person singular pronoun [...] "I", which Angelou uses often, is a symbol that refers to all her people. [...] Ramsey calls this [...] "a self-defining function", in which Angelou ironically views the world as an outsider, resulting {{in the loss of}} her direct and literal relationship to the world and providing her with the ability to [...] "laugh at its characteristics no matter how politically and socially devastating".
