25|$|In the 2010 Australian election, Mark Latham urged Australians to vote informally by handing in blank ballot {{papers for}} the 2010 election. He {{also stated that}} he doesn't feel it is fair for the {{government}} to force citizens to vote if they don't have an opinion or threaten them into voting with a fine. An Australian Electoral Commission spokesman stated that the Commonwealth Electoral Act did not contain an explicit provision prohibiting the casting of a blank vote. How the Australian Electoral Commission arrived at this opinion is unknown; it runs contrary to the opinions of Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, who wrote that voters must actually mark the ballot paper and deposit that ballot into a ballot box, and Justice Blackburn who was of the opinion that casting an <b>invalid</b> <b>vote</b> was a violation of the Act.|$|E
25|$|Controversy {{broke out}} in the Ankara Chamber of Commerce, where the {{overseas}} votes were being counted, when a ballot box that had been recorded to contain 200 votes was actually found to have 276 votes. In accordance to Turkish law, if the actual number of votes exceeds the recorded number, the count leader must choose votes at random and burn them until the numbers are equal. Violence subsequently breaking out, with several other counters who did not know the reason for the burning of votes alleging election fraud. With the tensions continuing to remain high, riot police were called to restore calm, with the burnt votes being impounded by the crime scene investigation unit. It was observed that the burnt votes also contained some cast for the AKP. Tensions also rose briefly after a count leader insisted that an <b>invalid</b> <b>vote</b> that had been cast for both the HDP and AKP should be counted as a valid vote for the HDP.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of <b>invalid</b> <b>voting</b> which has appeared in regional elections in the Olomouc region in the Czech Republic. First, contemporary theories of <b>invalid</b> <b>voting</b> are introduced. Second, the given hypotheses, which include both institutional and socio-economic factors that, according to the theories, contribute {{to higher levels of}} <b>invalid</b> <b>voting,</b> are tested. Statistical analysis such as linear regression is employed in the research. The dataset is comprised of municipalities (cases) in which regional elections were held. The results show that higher levels of <b>invalid</b> <b>voting</b> are associated with concurrent elections (elections to the regional assembly and elections to the upper house (the Senate) of the Czech Parliament) in those municipalities in which residents are older and less well-educated. If regional elections are held without concurring elections, socio-economic variables have a smaller effect on <b>invalid</b> <b>voting.</b> Therefore, the state authorities should consider a revision of respective electoral law and simplify the electoral process involved in concurrent elections...|$|R

5000|$|Beside the Two-tailed Dog Party, the NGOs Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (TASZ) and the Hungarian Helsinki Committee also {{urged to}} vote invalidly. According to the TASZ, the {{government}} is [...] "abusing" [...] the institution of referendum, and its campaign is [...] "fundamentally incompatible with a human rights approach". The Hungarian Helsinki Committee noted in favour of <b>invalid</b> <b>vote</b> that [...] "the difference is in the message. The act of boycott is only the passive rejection of the forced referendum", while <b>invalid</b> <b>vote</b> is more efficient {{and can not be}} misinterpreted. In a declaration issued on 14 September, 22 NGOs, including TASZ, the Helsinki Committee, the Eötvös Károly Institute, the Methodist Hungarian Evangelical Fellowship, the Migration Aid and the Belletrist Association jointly announced to support <b>invalid</b> <b>vote,</b> referring the government campaign as [...] "senseless" [...] and [...] "inhuman". István László Mészáros, a former SZDSZ MP announced to quit the Helsinki Committee, because the NGO [...] "entered into party politics" [...] and [...] "as an organization, which once dedicated to the values of democracy and the rights of citizens ... is campaigning against a referendum, {{one of the most important}} institutions of democracy". The Helsinki Committee responded that [...] "the government makes a mockery of the institution of referendum ... and it serves only a political campaign based on xenophobia". The organization held a 'Refugees Welcome' rally with the slogan [...] "See the Human!" [...] on 30 September, also attended by e.g. directors Béla Tarr and Róbert Alföldi, actor András Bálint and poet Virág Erdős. The Hungarian Helsinki Committee argued [...] "... majority of these people refugees are children! Europe, including Hungary, means the only chance and hope for them".|$|E
50|$|The {{result was}} a close race between the two main {{candidates}} to the General Secretariat: Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the party's candidate for the 2011 general elections and former First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, and Carme Chacón Piqueras, former Minister of Defense. The ballot saw Rubalcaba win by a 51% of the vote (487 votes) to the 49% won by Carme Chacón (465 votes), with 2 blank votes and 1 <b>invalid</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{expropriation}} opponents {{increased their}} efforts. Their core message was {{the claim that}} the proponents of the referendum were not just interested in the expropriation of the princes' property but intended the abolition of private property as such. The opponents called for a boycott of the referendum. This made sense from their perspective because each abstention (and each <b>invalid</b> <b>vote)</b> had the same effect as a [...] "no" [...] vote. The call for a boycott practically turned the secret ballot into an open one.|$|E

50|$|After the CDU/CSU {{narrowly}} {{lost the}} West German federal election of 1976 which had seen Kohl as the common chancellor {{candidate of the}} two parties, the CSU's future Bundestag representatives met on November 19, 1976 at a closed meeting at Wildbad Kreuth, at a Hanns Seidel Foundation compound, which is CSU's educational foundation. With a vote of 30-18 and one abstention (and one <b>invalid</b> <b>vote),</b> the CSU deputies decided to separate from their common faction with the CDU deputies in the Bundestag.

5000|$|Campaigning {{was intense}} {{during the week}} before the poll. On 11 May, the WA Farmers Federation claimed the Electoral Commission was biased as, while voters were {{instructed}} to write the words [...] "Yes" [...] or [...] "No" [...] in the box, a tick would be accepted as a yes, while a cross would be marked an <b>invalid</b> <b>vote.</b> On 13 May, Kalgoorlie independent MP John Bowler, who was a daylight saving supporter, pledged that if the referendum was passed, he would move a private member's bill to exclude March from the period. However, supporters labelled this a stunt, as there was no guarantee the bill would pass Parliament.|$|E
40|$|<b>Invalid</b> <b>voting</b> and {{absenteeism}} are {{alternative sources}} of abstention under compulsory voting. Previous research failed to systematically study the mechanisms behind each form of non-voting and the relationships between them. We develop an analytical framework and an empirical strategy to jointly examine <b>invalid</b> <b>voting</b> and absenteeism in Brazil, the world's largest democracy with mandatory voting. Using Bayesian inferential methods and analyzing both individual and district-level data, we show that less educated and politically knowledgeable citizens {{are less likely to}} vote and, when they do, they are typically unable to successfully complete their ballot. Unlike absenteeism, <b>invalid</b> <b>voting</b> also has a political dimension reflecting voters’ disenchantment with elections and democratic performance. Both sources of abstention coexist and, together, undermine electoral participation...|$|R

50|$|However, {{the advent}} of {{contemporary}} technology could preserve the integrity of secret balloting, whilst {{at the same time}} ensure a compelled voter casts a valid vote, which could further legitimise the absolute accuracy of ballots. In cases when the distribution of votes is very close, the elimination of the <b>invalid</b> <b>vote</b> of the resentful voter may be crucial in determining the outcome. For example, if a voter is presented with a stand-alone touch-screen device, the integrity of the secret ballot is preserved yet the participant is unable to bypass their compulsory obligation: the device computer software must register a valid option before it progresses to its function of printing a paper copy of the voter's choice, while the electoral law is adjusted so that the voter cannot be registered as legitimate until they produce a paper copy of their vote and insert it into an official ballot box.|$|E
