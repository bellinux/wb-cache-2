5|$|An earth {{house may}} be set into a slope, with windows or door {{openings}} {{in one or}} more of <b>its</b> <b>sides,</b> or the building may be on ground level, but with earth mounded against the walls, and perhaps with an earth roof.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been claimed that Heron's formula for calculating the area of a {{triangle}} from the length of <b>its</b> <b>sides</b> was known to Archimedes. However, the first reliable reference to the formula is given by Heron of Alexandria in the 1st century AD.|$|E
5|$|It was {{designed}} by William Edward Willink and Philip Coldwell Thicknesse and was constructed between 1914 and 1917. The building's style {{is a mix of}} Italian Renaissance and Greek Revival, and its development has been particularly influenced by Italian palace design. The building is noted for the ornate sculptures that adorn <b>its</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In December 2007, an {{estimated}} 4000 Eritrean troops {{remained in the}} 'demilitarized zone' with a further 120,000 along <b>its</b> <b>side</b> of the border. [...] Ethiopia maintained 100,000 troops along <b>its</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R

40|$|Coronary arteries supply {{blood to}} the myocardium. The blood flow within the {{coronary}} arteries is altered by various compounds produced within the body. Sex hormones such as testosterone are known to cause the relaxation of large coronary arteries. But the response to testosterone is greater in in vivo conditions compared to in vitro conditions. We hypothesize that the responses of LADs (left anterior descending arteries) and <b>its</b> <b>side</b> branches to testosterone are heterogeneous and testosterone-induced vasodilation is greater in <b>its</b> <b>side</b> branches. Therefore, our {{study was designed to}} determine the effect of testosterone in different-sized coronary arteries. LADs and one of <b>its</b> <b>side</b> branches were isolated from porcine hearts and mounted in organ baths to mimic in vivo conditions. The coronary arteries were then preconstricted with potassium chloride (KCl) and administered increasing concentrations of testosterone to determine if the responses to testosterone vary within different regions of the coronary circulation. The testosterone caused significant relaxation in both LADs and <b>its</b> <b>side</b> branches. However the side branches showed similar responses to testosterone as compared to the larger, upstream LADs. Further studies on androgen receptor expression using real time PCR indicated that androgen receptor expression was higher in LADs than <b>its</b> <b>side</b> branches. A third group of small coronary arteries exhibited greater androgen receptor expression than the LADs and <b>its</b> <b>side</b> branches. The enhanced testosterone-induced vascular reactivity exhibited in vivo may be {{at the level of the}} small coronary arteries, not the LAD and <b>its</b> <b>side</b> branches...|$|R

The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate {{that one of}} <b>its</b> <b>sides</b> has a higher surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also be higher, causing more water vapor to be released into the atmosphere. This process would ultimately produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, {{for reasons}} unknown, the Wanderers, despite having turned aside four challengers, did not record {{their names on}} the Cup. The next year, the Ottawa Senators added a second band onto the Cup. Despite the new room, the 1910 Wanderers and the 1911 Senators did not put their names on the Cup. The 1915 Vancouver Millionaires became the second team to engrave players' names, this time inside the bowl along <b>its</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|E

5|$|T.chatareus can be {{distinguished}} by their sooty colour, {{as opposed to the}} typical silver of most other archerfish. They have five dorsal spines, whereas T.jaculatrix have four. The markings on their flanks are also alternating long and short spots rather than bands. T.chatareus also have six or seven markings on <b>its</b> <b>sides,</b> whilst banded archerfish have four to five. T.chatareus has 29–30 lateral line scales, compared to 33–35 in T. jaculatrix. T.chatareus are also less common upstream than T.microlepis.|$|E
5|$|The Yavapai built brush shelter {{dwellings}} called Wa'm bu nya:va (Wom-boo-nya-va). In summer, {{they built}} simple lean-tos without walls. During winter months, closed huts (called uwas) {{would be built}} of ocotillo branches or other wood and covered with animal skins, grasses, bark, and/or dirt. In the Colorado River area, Ɖo:lkabaya built Uwađ a'mađva, a rectangular hut, that had dirt piled up against <b>its</b> <b>sides</b> for insulation, and a flat roof. They also sought shelter in caves or abandoned pueblos to escape the cold.|$|E
5|$|The choir {{is where}} the priest and/or a choral group sings the psalms. It {{is located in the}} central nave between the main door and the high altar, and built in a semicircular fashion, much like Spanish cathedrals. It was built by Juan de Rojas between 1696 and 1697. <b>Its</b> <b>sides</b> contain 59reliefs of various saints done in mahogany, walnut, cedar and a native wood called tepehuaje. The railing that {{surrounds}} the choir was made in 1722 by Sangley Queaulo in Macao, China and placed in the cathedral in 1730.|$|E

5|$|The {{decoration}} of the elongated {{north and south}} walls includes brick blind arches in the bottom part and a large arch for each wall adjacent to the dome with a columned window in the middle. There are windows above the lower arches of {{the north and south}} facade. The dome, which also exhibits a large number of ornamental details and ceramics, features eight windows, one for each of <b>its</b> <b>sides.</b> The medieval frescoes which were painted on the interior walls of the church have been only fragmentarily preserved.|$|E
5|$|The main conning {{tower was}} {{protected}} by 12 inches of armour on <b>its</b> <b>sides</b> {{and it had a}} 4-inch roof. The aft conning tower (sometimes called the torpedo control tower) had 9-inch sides and a 3-inch roof. The communications tube down from each position was 6 inches thick above the upper deck and 2 inches thick below it. Each magazine {{was protected by}} two armour plates on each side as torpedo bulkheads, the first one an inch thick and the second one and a half inches thick.|$|E
5|$|The new Revelin {{became the}} strongest {{of the city}} fortresses, {{safeguarding}} the eastern land approach to the city. Shaped {{in the form of}} an irregular quadrilateral with one of <b>its</b> <b>sides</b> descending towards the sea, it is protected by a deep ditch on the other. One bridge crosses the protective ditch and connects it to the Ploče Gate, while another bridge connects it to the eastern suburb. The construction work was executed so perfectly so that the devastating earthquake of 1667 did not damage Revelin. Divided into three large vaulted rooms in its interior, Revelin became the administrative center of the Republic.|$|E

5|$|Blast Corps is a single-player action video game. The player {{controls}} {{vehicles to}} destroy buildings, farms, and other {{structures in the}} path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object. The eight demolition vehicles vary in the way they clear structures: the bulldozer rams, the dump truck drifts, the lightweight buggy crashes from higher ground, the tricycle shoots missiles, another truck presses outwards from <b>its</b> <b>sides,</b> and robot mechs tumble and stomp from the land and the air. The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game's puzzles increase in difficulty as the player progresses through its 57 levels.|$|E
5|$|The Rosetta Stone was {{originally}} displayed at a slight angle from the horizontal, and rested within a metal cradle {{that was made}} for it, which involved shaving off very small portions of <b>its</b> <b>sides</b> {{to ensure that the}} cradle fitted securely. It originally had no protective covering, and it was found necessary by 1847 to place it in a protective frame, despite the presence of attendants to ensure that it was not touched by visitors. Since 2004, the conserved stone has been on display in a specially built case in the centre of the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery. A replica of the Rosetta Stone is now available in the King's Library of the British Museum, without a case and free to touch, as it would have appeared to early 19th-century visitors.|$|E
5|$|The angles made by {{each pair}} of arcs {{at the corners of}} a Reuleaux {{triangle}} are all equal to 120°. This is the sharpest possible angle at any vertex of any curve of constant width. Additionally, among the curves of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle is the one with both the largest and the smallest inscribed equilateral triangles. The largest equilateral triangle inscribed in a Reuleaux triangle is the one connecting its three corners, and the smallest one is the one connecting the three midpoints of <b>its</b> <b>sides.</b> The subset of the Reuleaux triangle consisting of points belonging to three or more diameters is the interior of the larger of these two triangles; it has a larger area than the set of three-diameter points of any other curve of constant width.|$|E

5|$|Although {{observations}} of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests its lifestyle is inactive and sluggish. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly calcified, the muscle blocks along <b>its</b> <b>sides</b> (myomeres) are weakly developed, and its fins {{are soft and}} small. Its long caudal fin, held at a low angle, is also typical of a slow-swimming shark. The long snout {{appears to have a}} sensory function, as it bears numerous ampullae of Lorenzini that can detect the weak electric fields produced by other animals. Due to the snout's softness, it is unlikely to be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed. Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small optic tectum in the shark's brain. Yet unlike most deep-sea sharks, it can change the size of its pupils, thus probably does use its sight in some situations. Goblin sharks may fall prey to the blue shark (Prionace glauca). Parasites documented from this species include the copepod Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae, and the tapeworms Litobothrium amsichensis and Marsupiobothrium gobelinus.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigation}} of Olmec basalt workshops {{suggest that the}} colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away {{both large and small}} flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones, which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself, although this was not always the case. Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo, indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses. Monument20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. <b>Its</b> <b>sides</b> were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned. It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re-carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed.|$|E
5|$|Seeing no activity, the {{commander}} of the Russian II Corps ordered all his cannons to shift fire onto the 14 guns under Józef Bem. Heavily pressed, Polish artillery withstood the fire for over half an hour before switching to new positions {{to the right of the}} road to Kalisz. It resumed fire on the II Corps, but was again targeted by enemy guns. The artillery duel continued, but the situation of Fort 56 was becoming critical. Shelled from three sides, the largest Polish fort around Warsaw was now isolated. Including reinforcements brought by Col. Wysocki, the crew of the fort included approximately 1,660 infantrymen and ten pieces of artillery. By 10:00 most artillerymen had been killed or wounded (including the fort's artillery commander, Capt. Krzywicki) and had to be replaced with untrained infantrymen, which seriously limited the Polish guns' rate of fire and accuracy. All ramparts were successively damaged by Russian artillery, and there was a 30-metre breach in one of <b>its</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|E

5000|$|However, as of September 2007, Ethiopia {{considered}} Eritrea {{to be in}} {{breach of}} the agreement, and warned that it could use this as grounds to terminate or suspend the agreement.
