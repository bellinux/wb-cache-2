5|$|In November 2008, {{a public}} sector inward {{investment}} organisation was launched, called Into Somerset, {{with the intention}} of growing the county's economy by promoting it to businesses that may wish to relocate <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK (especially London) and the world.|$|E
5|$|Despite Hong Kong's {{reputation}} of being intensely urbanised, the territory has tried to promote a green environment, and recent growing public concern has prompted the severe restriction of further land reclamation from Victoria Harbour. Awareness of the environment is growing as Hong Kong suffers from increasing pollution compounded by its geography and tall buildings. Approximately 80% of the city's smog originates <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pearl River Delta.|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{a common}} place for the spread of tumors <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. Secondary cancers are {{classified}} by the site of origin; e.g., breast cancer that has spread to the lung is called metastatic breast cancer. Metastases often have a characteristic round appearance on chest radiograph.|$|E

5|$|There are {{regular train}} {{services}} <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK {{to the south}} west, principal destination stations being Barnstaple, Exeter, Newquay, Penzance, Plymouth and Weymouth. From these places local trains or buses connect to many points of the path. Airports at Bournemouth, Exeter and Newquay are served {{from a range of}} national and international destinations.|$|E
5|$|At this moment, {{having failed}} twice {{to make a}} breakthrough, Marlborough {{received}} intelligence that the defences linking the town walls with the breastwork on the hill were now sparsely manned (Marlborough's unsuccessful attacks had drawn d'Arco's men away <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stronghold, leaving his left flank almost defenceless and highly vulnerable). The other Allied commander, the Margrave of Baden (who had entered the battle half an hour after Marlborough), also noticed this opportunity and was soon hurrying with his grenadiers from the hamlet of Berg, and across the Kaibach stream to assault the position.|$|E
5|$|By September 5, the Salvation Army, Red Cross, {{and other}} {{organizations}} had served 100,000 meals to those displaced by the hurricane in Mississippi, and federal food stocks became available {{for the state to}} distribute to storm victims. Still, resources such as food and ice started to run short in the hardest-hit locations, and long lines formed at the first few stores and gas stations to reopen. With dwindling supplies, the Salvation Army had to procure food <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region to serve to victims. In the days after the hurricane, an increase in heart attack deaths in the Harrison County area was noted.|$|E

50|$|London in the 1840s {{was more}} like a 21st-century Third World {{megalopolis}} than a 19th-century city. A significant portion of the population had no fixed place of work, and indeed, many had no fixed abode. In classic fashion, the city teemed with outsiders and migrants <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Britain, even <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Europe.|$|R
5|$|During British rule, Tiruchirappalli {{was known}} for its tanneries, cigar-manufacturing units and oil presses. At its peak, more than 12 million cigars were {{manufactured}} and exported annually. Tanned hides and skins from Tiruchirappalli were exported to the United Kingdom. The city {{has a number of}} retail and wholesale markets, the most prominent among them being the Gandhi Market, which also serves people <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district. Other notable markets in the city are the flower bazaar in Srirangam and the mango market at Mambazha Salai. The suburb of Manachanallur is known for its rice mills, where polished Ponni rice is produced.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} {{phases of the}} revolt, many land (timar) holders were killed or expelled. As it spread, the nobles, whose {{holdings}} had been annexed by the Ottomans returned to join the revolt and attempts to form alliances with the Holy Roman Empire were initiated. While {{the leaders of the}} revolt were successful in defeating successive Ottoman campaigns, they failed to capture many important towns of the sanjak of Albania. Protracted sieges like that of Gjirokastër, capital of the sanjak, gave the Ottoman army time to assemble large forces <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empire and to subdue the main revolt by the end of 1436. Ottoman forces conducted a number of massacres {{in the aftermath of the}} revolt.|$|E
5|$|Houses found {{today in}} Zeeland are closer in {{appearance}} {{to the fine}} Dutch brick houses of New York than are houses <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. Brick farm houses built separately from barns are found in Zeeland, but none have survived in other locations. Unlike the common practice in New York, the farm houses in Zeeland do not have separate outside doors for each room. The Dutch also used bricks to pave the roads, or chaussees, in the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to this, the ACWF {{played an important}} role internationally for the CPC. As a communist country in the Cold War, China had difficulty establishing diplomatic connections. ACWF was able to reach out to women’s movements abroad, and even hosted 23 delegations <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world for the Asia Women’s Representative Conference in December 1949. This enabled the PRC to go around the diplomatic blockade and forge connections with other countries. However, soon the Cultural Revolution would begin in China, which forced the ACWF to discontinue many of its policies.|$|E
5|$|Many of Vargas Llosa's {{works are}} {{influenced}} by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, however, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism {{in different parts of the}} world. Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.|$|E
5|$|Several major {{companies}} have their headquarters in Aarhus such as Arla Foods, {{one of the}} largest dairy groups in Europe, Dansk Supermarked, Denmark's largest retailer, Jysk, a worldwide retailer specialising in household goods, bedding, furniture and interior design, Vestas, one of the major wind turbine developers worldwide, and several leading retail companies. In total, four of the 10 largest companies in the country are based in the municipality. Since the early 2000s, the city has experienced an influx of larger companies moving <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jutland peninsula. Other large employers of note include Krifa (a trades union organisation) and 5R, a telemarketing company, while metallurgy and electronics remain important sectors.|$|E

5|$|State {{and central}} {{government}} employees {{make up a}} large percentage of the city's workforce. Mumbai also has a large unskilled and semi-skilled self-employed population, who primarily earn their livelihood as hawkers, taxi drivers, mechanics and other such blue collar professions. The port and shipping industry is well established, with Mumbai Port being one of the oldest and most significant ports in India. Dharavi, in central Mumbai, has an increasingly large recycling industry, processing recyclable waste <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city; the district has an estimated 15,000 single-room factories.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Crown {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} with public health. Diseases had always troubled the colonies, and town councils spent money to bring physicians or sanitary equipment <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Americas. Reports by doctors about the sanitary and hygienic conditions of various neighborhoods {{of the cities}} were frequent. As a man of science, Eugenio Espejo demonstrated {{his knowledge of the}} latest scientific advances in Europe and the Americas. Most of the arguments and recommendations he made in his medical works can be found in contemporary sources, such as the Mémoires of the French Academy of Sciences.|$|E
5|$|The alpine runs (Le piste alpine) {{were built}} {{on the slopes of}} Monte Tofana and Monte Faloria in the nearby Dolomite alps. The men's and women's {{downhill}} and slalom races were held on Tofana. Faloria was the site of the two giant slalom events. It took nearly two years to complete construction of the runs. In previous years, lack of snow was never an issue, but in the winter of 1956 there was insufficient snowfall for skiers to safely navigate the runs. As a consequence, snow had to be transported <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains by the Italian army.|$|E

5|$|The {{indigenous}} people of Enugu include the Ogui Nike {{who live in}} the areas surrounding Hotel Presidential, Obiagu, Ama-Igbo, Ihewuzi and Onu-Asata. Other groups include the Awkunanaw people, who live mainly in the Achara Layout and Uwani areas. The Enugwu Ngwo people live in Hilltop on the west of the city with their farm lands sprawling all over the valley. Other Nike people live around the Abakpa, Iji-Nike, and Emene areas of the city. Most of the non-{{indigenous people}} of Enugu are migrants <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Igbo cultural area. After the majority Igbo, the Yoruba people are another significant ethnic group found present in Enugu; other groups include the Hausa, Kanuri, Ijaw, and Fulani people.|$|E
5|$|When Oblivion did open, {{the area}} was re-themed {{to look like a}} {{sinister}} government facility, unlike Fantasy World's fairground theme, and renamed X-Sector. The only surviving ride from Fantasy World, the Black Hole roller coaster, was also changed; the large tent that it was situated in was repainted to blue and silver instead of green and yellow stripes. To make the new X-Sector a major ride area, Alton Towers added two old rides <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park: Energizer and Enterprise (both from Festival Park, now Dark Forest). Both rides were repainted to fit to the new theme.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Ohio, Gottesman studied {{psychology}} for his {{undergraduate and graduate}} degrees, became {{a faculty member at}} various universities, and spent most of his career at the University of Virginia and the University of Minnesota. He is known for researching schizophrenia in identical twins to document the contributions of genetics and the family, social, cultural, and economic environment to the onset, progress, and inter-generational transmission of the disorder. Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze hospital records and conduct follow-up interviews of twins where one or both were schizophrenic. He has also researched the effects of genetics and the environment on human violence and variations in human intelligence. Gottesman and co-researcher James Shields introduced the word epigenetics—the control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genome—to the field of psychiatric genetics.|$|E
