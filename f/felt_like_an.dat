5|$|The {{publication}} debuted {{at number}} one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times and The Globe and Mail, holding the position on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Generally well received by critics, Outliers was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much Outliers <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> autobiography. Reviews praised the connection that Gladwell draws between his own background {{and the rest of the}} publication to conclude the book. Reviewers also appreciated the questions posed by Outliers, finding it important to determine how much individual potential is ignored by society. However, the lessons learned were considered anticlimactic and dispiriting. The writing style, though deemed easy to understand, was criticized for oversimplifying complex social phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Charlie's {{family was}} not {{dysfunctional}} or abusive. On the contrary, Charlie's parents adored him, and made great sacrifices {{to give him}} a good education. His Da, a gardener for a rich Anglo-Irish family, was kind and patient, but also woefully unsophisticated and lacking in ambition. Charlie loved Da, but was also embarrassed by him, and felt guilty for this embarrassment. Charlie was an illegitimate child at a time when this carried a heavy stigma in Catholic Ireland. Though Da accepted Charlie fully, Charlie always <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider, heavily indebted to Da. Moreover, Charlie could never find a way to repay Da, or even fully express his love and gratitude.|$|E
25|$|In November 2002, {{the book}} “Victoria, Victoria!” came out, {{speaking}} further about her eating disorder. Victoria said: “I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> accelerating train, going right down... {{during the whole}} period. I had eating disorders and was aware of it, my anguish was enormous. I really hated how I looked like, how I was... I, Victoria, didn’t exist. It felt like everything {{in my life and}} around me was controlled by others. The one thing I could control was the food I put in me”. She further said that “What happened cost and I was the one who stood for the payments. Now I’m feeling well and with the insights I’ve acquired through this I can hopefully help someone else”.|$|E

25|$|After the remarriage, Auchincloss' Merrywood {{estate in}} McLean, Virginia became the Bouvier sisters' primary residence, {{although}} they also spent time at his other estate, Hammersmith Farm in Newport, Rhode Island, {{and in their}} father's homes in New York City and Long Island. Although she retained a relationship with her father, Bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure. He gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood she never would have experienced otherwise. While Bouvier adjusted to her mother's remarriage, she sometimes <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider in the WASP social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being Catholic {{as well as being}} a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time.|$|E
25|$|While {{writing the}} stories in the collection, Tatsumi was running a {{publishing}} house for manga rental shops so {{he did not have}} time to work on his own manga. At the same time, manga rental shops were declining in favor of manga magazines. According to Tatsumi in a 2004 interview, because he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outcast in the manga industry, he wanted to sincerely portray the working class around him in slice of life portraits. He was also influenced by police reports and human interest stories in newspapers. When he was given an assignment, he would choose three stories from twenty of his ideas and show the layouts for his editor to choose one. He would draw the actual stories without assistants using Kent paper and calligraphic pens.|$|E
25|$|Uyesugi {{pleaded not}} guilty by reason of {{insanity}} and claimed that he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outcast at work and that he feared his colleagues were conspiring to have him fired. Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Daryl Matthews testified for the defense that he was insane, citing the delusions about how others were tampering with his fish. Lead prosecution expert witness Dr. Harold Hall testified that the Defendant fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but he did not meet the criteria for either insanity or extreme emotion or mental disturbance (EMED). Dr. Michael Welner testified for the prosecution that although Mr. Uyesugi was in his opinion a schizophrenic, he carried out the shooting because he was angry that he would be fired for insubordination, and that his own account of concealment before the crime demonstrated that he knew what he had done was wrong.|$|E

25|$|Before {{recording}} By the Way (2002), the Chili Peppers {{decided that}} they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album. In the past, Rubin had given the band creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return. Originally the album was headed in a much different direction than the final production. The album {{started out as a}} group of fast, hardcore punk songs, which Rubin rejected. Frusciante also wanted a darker, 1980s UK pop/new wave sound mixed in with 1980s hardcore. The recording process was tough for Flea, who <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider in the band and that his role was being diminished due to a musical power struggle with Frusciante. Flea wanted to create more funk-inspired songs, while Frusciante felt that the band had overused their funk side. Flea considered quitting the band after the album, but the two eventually worked out all their problems.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the combat}} photographers {{were able to}} shoot images of the trek {{to and from the}} camp, they were unable to use their cameras during the night-time raid, as the flashes would {{indicate}} their positions to the Japanese. One of the photographers reflected on the nighttime hindrance: [...] "We <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> eager soldier who had carried his rifle for long distances into one of the war's most crucial battles, then {{never got a chance to}} fire it." [...] The Signal Corps photographers instead assisted with escorting the POWs out of the camp.|$|E

Olugbala means “love for the people” in Yoruba. She now {{identified}} as an African and felt her old name no longer fit: “It sounded so strange when people called me Joanne. It really {{had nothing to do}} with me. I didn’t feel like no Joanne, or no negro, or no amerikan. I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> African woman”.|$|E

500|$|Michelle Erica Green, in her {{review for}} TrekNation, {{found that the}} voice work was distracting due to the {{similarity}} between William Shatner's and Ted Knight's voices; as well as having Nichelle Nichols voice a different character. She also thought that the alien looked silly, and felt that the plot had been reused from [...] "The Man Trap". In 2012, Chris Cummins listed the eight best episodes of The Animated Series for website Topless Robot. He praised the writing of Schmerer, saying that the episode <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> episode of The Original Series, and placed it as the third best episode of the series. The episode was given {{four out of five}} stars in Star Trek: The Complete Manual by SciFiNow magazine.|$|E
500|$|David Duchovny was {{somewhat}} {{disappointed with the}} episode, hoping {{he would have had}} a chance to do more in an episode that was primarily a symbolic journey for him rather than a real one. The actor said [...] "I like the psychology, and I like the thinking that went into the episode as a viewer. As an actor, I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> opportunity passed me by. If I had to do any episode over again, it would be that one." [...] The actor called the episode in 1995 the greatest missed opportunity they had. Chris Carter disagreed, stating that Fox Mulder's role in the episode was the right way to do it, and that the dramatic weight for the episode had to shift from Mulder to Dana Scully.|$|E

500|$|Based on her {{original}} script, Randall {{was awarded a}} fellowship to the Los Angeles Film School's Feature Development Programme in 2002. She said that, under the mentorship of the school's faculty, [...] "The screenplay evolved by becoming lighter and funnier and also the story and structure got tighter." [...] In 2003, Randall was nominated for an Australian Writers' Guild AWGIE Award for Best Unproduced Screenplay. Randall's script was subsequently picked up by producer Miriam Stein and her production company, Tama Films. Stein said that [...] "The script resonated with me from the start", particularly because of her similar adolescent experience as a Jewish girl who <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider. Stein brought the film into production after recruiting Nice Pictures CEO Heather Ogilvie as executive producer, Los Angeles-based Harry Clein as associate producer and Buena Vista International to handle distribution in Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} {{a photograph of}} Dylan with Suze Rotolo. It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein {{at the corner of}} Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: [...] "He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat." [...] In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: ...|$|E
500|$|In her fictional backstory, Ruth {{was born}} on 16 June 1968 to Solly (Richard Griffiths) and Heather Pritchard (Joyce Gibbs; Margaret Jackman). She was raised in Prudhoe, Northumberland. Ruth worked on an Israeli kibbutz for a year, prior to her {{acceptance}} onto an agricultural course at Harper Adams University College. She then applied for a year's work experience at Brookfield Farm and she was hired by Phil Archer (Norman Painting). Smethurst wrote that Ruth stood out among {{many of the other}} female characters {{at the time of her}} introduction, as she was a New Woman, a feminist and a farmer. Her favourite style is a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. Upon her arrival in Ambridge, Ruth <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider. This was not helped by David's attitude towards her being an unskilled woman and her landlady's nosy demeanour. Ruth's [...] "dedication and willingness" [...] eventually won David round and he came to appreciate her.|$|E

500|$|Giving {{the album}} {{three out of}} five stars, Ben Ratliff from Rolling Stone {{summarized}} that the messages on the album are dour, but complimented Madonna for talking about the then-current situation of the nation. Johny Davis from NME gave the album a rating of seven out of ten, saying that technically the album sounds good, but overall it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> unnecessary sequel to Madonna's previous endeavors like Ray of Light and Music. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that American Life is better for what it promises than what it delivers, {{and that it is}} better in theory than practice. Kelefa Sanneh from Blender awarded the album three stars out of five. [...] "Just as disjointed as Music and much more severe... Without a compelling back story, her songs seem diminished". Dorian Lynskey from Q magazine also rated it three out of five, stating [...] "'Nothing Fails', the album's centerpiece, is as good a showstopper as 'Live to Tell'... it's no wonder that a record about feeling confused ends up sounding confused".|$|E
500|$|Jeff Gerstmann, {{co-founder of}} Giant Bomb, felt that while Forza Motorsport 4 was a [...] "fantastic driving game" [...] it merely <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{incremental}} improvement on its predecessor. [...] "I found myself getting a very 'annual sports game update' vibe off of it," [...] stated Gerstmann. Justin Calvert of GameSpot agreed; {{he said that}} Forza Motorsport 4 refines upon its predecessor, [...] "but also feels {{just a little too}} familiar". X-Plays Jason D'Aprile also felt that Forza Motorsport 4 an improvement over Forza Motorsport 3, [...] "making it the absolute king of the road." [...] He cited the game's audio and visuals, the number of cars and tracks, the online play and variable skill level all as high points. However, D'Aprile felt that the Kinect implementation was [...] "a gimmick" [...] and expressed disappointment that there was not more content involving Top Gear. Matthew Kato, reviewer for Game Informer, was unimpressed by Forzas Kinect integration as well. He felt that Kinect-based racing [...] "isn’t satisfying since your arms get tired and the game controls the gas and brake for you." ...|$|E
500|$|Although it {{was highly}} anticipated, when {{the series was}} {{initially}} broadcast, the response was lukewarm from fans and reviewers. John J.

Other critics of [...] "Encounter at Farpoint" [...] were more positive; Don Merrill, writing for TV Guide said that the show was a [...] "worthy successor to the original". Jill L. Lanford for The Herald Journal {{said that it was}} a resurrection of a [...] "legend" [...] and was reminiscent of The Original Series episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "The Squire of Gothos". She added that it was the [...] "perfect vehicle to introduce the crew", and a [...] "perfect start". There was also some initial criticism of the casting, with Tom Shales of The Washington Post calling Patrick Stewart was a [...] "grim bald crank who would make a better villain", and Jonathan Frakes [...] "verges on namby-pamby". Mark Jones and Lance Parkin, in their book Beyond the Final Frontier : An Unauthorised Review of Star Trek, said the first season [...] "often <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> uneasy politically correct attempt to recreate one of the sixties' least politically correct shows." ...|$|E
