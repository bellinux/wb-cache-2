5|$|Cibber's poetical {{work was}} derided in his time, {{and has been}} remembered only for being poor.

5|$|Although the {{doctrine}} of karma is central to all Indian religions, {{it is difficult to}} say when and where in India the concept of karma originated. In Jainism, it is assumed its development took place in an era from which the literary documents are not available, since the basics of this doctrine were present and concluded even in the earliest <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> Jains. Acaranga Sutra and Sutrakritanga, contain a general outline of {{the doctrine}}s of karma and reincarnation. The roots of this doctrine in Jainism might be in the teachings of Parsva, who is said to have lived about two hundred fifty years before Mahavira. The Jain conception of karma—as something material that encumbers the soul—has an archaic nature which justifies the hypothesis that it goes back to 8th or 9th century BCE.|$|E

5|$|For {{narrative}} {{history the}} principal sources are the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Irish annals. The evidence from charters {{created in the}} Kingdom of England provides occasional insight into events in northern Britain. While Scandinavian sagas describe events in 10th-century Britain, their value as sources of historical narrative, rather than <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> social history, is disputed. Mainland European sources rarely concern themselves with affairs in Britain, and even less commonly with events in northern Britain, but the life of Saint Cathróe of Metz, a work of hagiography written in Germany {{at the end of}} the 10th century, provides plausible details of the saint's early life in north Britain.|$|E
5|$|Latin {{documents}} {{used the}} term Wallachia or Wallachia maior (‘Greater Wallachia’) for Muntenia (which first appeared in 1373), and Wallachia minor (‘Lesser Wallachia’) for Oltenia (first recorded in 1377). The new country was identified as terra transalpina (‘land beyond the mountains’) or partes transalpinae (‘parts beyond the mountains’) in documents issued by the Royal Chancellery of Hungary in the entire 14th century. The terminology of the Hungarian chancellery was also used in the Latin <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> the Wallachian voivodes.|$|E
5|$|Steinhaus, {{because of}} his Jewish background, spent the Nazi {{occupation}} in hiding, first among friends in Lwów, then in the small towns of Osiczyna, near Zamość and Berdechów, near Kraków.

Under this name he taught clandestine classes (higher education was forbidden for Poles under the German occupation). Worried about the possibility of imminent death if captured by Germans, Steinhaus, without access to any scholarly material, reconstructed from memory and recorded all the mathematics he knew, in addition to writing other voluminous memoirs, of which only a little part has been published.|$|E
