5|$|Although Tacitus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the most reliable author of this era, <b>his</b> <b>views</b> <b>on</b> Domitian are {{complicated by the fact that}} his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor. In his biographical work Agricola, Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of his writing, {{at the time of his}} death Wallace had been for many years a {{well-known}} figure both as a scientist and as a social activist.

He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the Royal Society's Royal Medal and Darwin Medal in 1868 and 1890 respectively, and the Order of Merit in 1908. Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure.|$|E
5|$|As a senator, Walker {{continued}} {{to focus on}} finance, although <b>his</b> <b>views</b> <b>on</b> social policy sometimes saw him {{on the outside of}} his party. He supported the White Australia policy but disagreed with key elements, and was a leader in opposition to the dictation test, by which a potential immigrant was required to pass a test in any European language before their application was accepted. He also campaigned for a transcontinental railway and for a capital city to be located on federal territory. Attempts to guide financial reform through the parliament as a backbench senator led to frustration, and Walker retired due to ill health in 1913 with his legislation unpassed.|$|E
5|$|Criticism over artistic {{matters in}} The Pall Mall Gazette {{provoked}} {{a letter in}} self-defence, and soon Wilde was a contributor to that and other journals during 1885–87.

Buoyed up, his reviews were largely chatty and positive. Wilde, like his parents before him, also supported the cause of Irish Nationalism. When Charles Stewart Parnell was falsely accused of inciting murder Wilde wrote a series of astute columns defending him in the Daily Chronicle.|$|E
