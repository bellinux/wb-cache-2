40|$|Introduction: we {{have tested}} the {{hypothesis}} that the co-occurrence of common <b>impairments</b> (motor and cognitive <b>impairments,</b> vision and hearing loss, depressive symptoms) of later life have exacerbating effects on disability [activities and instrumental activities of daily living, social and role function, (in) activity]. Method: data were drawn from a community-based sample of 624 people aged 57 and older. Results: motor <b>impairments</b> and depressive symptoms were associated with all disability measures, even when the effects of other <b>impairments,</b> age and gender were controlled. This indicates independent, predominant effects of motor <b>impairments</b> and depressive symptoms. Although several significant first-order interaction effects (indicating exacerbation) of <b>impairments</b> on disability were found, they were not very strong, but vision and hearing losses exacerbate the impact of the other <b>impairments</b> on disability. Conclusions: <b>impairments,</b> particularly motor <b>impairments</b> and depressive symptoms, largely act 'solo', by main effects on disability. Only a few combinations including vision or hearing loss further exacerbate the effects of other <b>impairments</b> on disability...|$|R
40|$|Various {{theories}} of developmental language <b>impairments</b> {{have sought to}} explain these <b>impairments</b> in modality-specific ways – for example, that the language deficits in SLI or Down syndrome arise from <b>impairments</b> in auditory processing.

A series of individual and small group studies are presented here illustrating language <b>impairments</b> in sign language users and cross-modal bilinguals, comprising Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Williams syndrome, Down syndrome, Autism and SLI.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{establish}} the prevalence of sensory, neurological and systemic <b>impairments</b> in the Inuit pediatric population (0 - 18 years) in 13 communities of the Baffin region of the Northwest Territories, Canada. A data collection instrument (DCI) was developed to obtain clinical data from medical files in each of the Community Health Centres. <b>Impairments</b> rather than disabilities were described and possible causal factors were identified. Data collection took place during the month of June, 1989. Nearly 13 % of Inuit children living in the Baffin area have <b>impairments.</b> Of this group, 15. 9 % have multiple <b>impairments.</b> The prevalence of children with sensory <b>impairments</b> is 49. 4 / 1000, with neurological <b>impairments</b> is 28. 7 / 1000, with systemic <b>impairments</b> is 30. 2 / 1000 and with multiple <b>impairments</b> is 20. 5 / 1000 children.

40|$|Background: Subjective {{cognitive}} <b>impairments</b> are frequent, but {{poorly understood}} {{in patients with}} chronic fatigue. We hypothesized that maladaptive metacognitive beliefs at baseline were associated with baseline subjective cognitive <b>impairments,</b> that they predict subjective cognitive <b>impairments</b> at treatment termination, and that a reduction in maladaptive metacognitive beliefs was associated with less subjective cognitive <b>impairments</b> at treatment termination, independent of changes in fatigue, pain, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Methods: In this non-controlled study, patients (n= 137) on sick leave due to chronic fatigue received a 3. 5 -week inpatient RTW rehabilitation program. Of these patients 69 (50. 4 %) was referred with a ICPC- 2 diagnosis of chronic fatigue. Patients completed questionnaires about metacognitive beliefs, somatic complaints, psychological complaints, and cognitive <b>impairments</b> before and after treatment. To test the hypotheses we performed paired t tests of change, as well as seven hierarchical linear regressions. Results: Results showed that baseline maladaptive metacognitive beliefs {{were significantly associated with}} subjective cognitive <b>impairments</b> at baseline, controlling for symptoms. Score on baseline metacognitive beliefs did not predict <b>impairments</b> post-treatment. Testing specific maladaptive beliefs, pre-treatment scores on cognitive confidence were associated with subjective cognitive <b>impairments</b> both pre and post-treatment, controlling for symptoms. Post-treatment metacognitive beliefs and post-treatment cognitive confidence were associated with post-treatment subjective cognitive <b>impairments,</b> controlling for pre-treatment <b>impairments</b> and pre-treatment metacognitive beliefs, as well as pre and post scores on symptom measures. Conclusion: This study reports associations between maladaptive metacognitive beliefs and subjective cognitive <b>impairments</b> in patients with chronic fatigue. Targeting metacognitive beliefs could prove an effective therapeutic intervention for subjective cognitive <b>impairments</b> in these patients...|$|R

40|$|With the {{advances}} in congenital cardiac surgery and medical management in recent decades, mortality rates for congenital heart defects (CHD) have declined remarkably. As {{the number of}} CHD survivors has increased, {{there is a growing}} focus on developmental <b>impairments.</b> Developmental <b>impairments</b> within a variety of developmental domains have been reported in school-age children with CHD. Less is known about the occurrence and persistence of developmental <b>impairments</b> in early childhood in children with CHD. The aim of this dissertation was therefore to study developmental <b>impairments</b> during {{the first three years of}} life in children with CHD. For this purpose, data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, was linked with a nationwide medical CHD registry. Children with different severity of CHD were compared with children without CHD on developmental <b>impairments</b> in the motor, communication, and social domains. All information on child development was reported by mothers in MoBa questionnaires. For the age span under study we found important differences between children with CHD and the controls. In early infancy two groups stood out as being particularly at risk for developmental impairments: Children with severe CHD showed higher odds for <b>impairments</b> in gross and fine motor skills. Children with CHD and comorbidity showed developmental <b>impairments</b> across gross motor, fine motor, and social domains. At age 18 months the same two groups differed from controls in levels of symptoms of communication <b>impairments</b> and social <b>impairments.</b> The largest differences from controls were found in children with CHD and comorbidity. At 3 years of age children with severe CHD had higher odds of both gross motor and communication <b>impairments</b> compared with controls. Children with mild and moderate CHD had higher odds of gross motor <b>impairments</b> but did not otherwise differ from controls. Predictors of <b>impairments</b> identified in children with severe CHD were: previous developmental <b>impairments,</b> smaller head circumference at birth, small for gestational age, and maternal distress. These findings are important for our understanding of early development in children with CHD. They underline the importance of early attentiveness to developmental <b>impairments</b> and the importance of considering patient-specific conditions at birth for providing individualized, targeted therapeutic strategies that may improve developmental outcomes in children with CHD...|$|R
