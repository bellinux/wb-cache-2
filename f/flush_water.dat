This paper proposes a mathematical model of <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> consumption for residential developments. Density functions of the model parameters, including the installed cistern capacity and usage patterns of water closets, occupant load and its diurnal variations, were determined from a recent survey for water consumption in some residential buildings in Hong Kong. In particular, numerical values of the parameters were sampled from the density functions using the Monte Carlo technique in order to determine the probable <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> consumption for a residential development.

6000|$|Nothing more {{strongly}} arouses our disgust than cannibalism, nothing so surely unmortars a society; nothing, we might plausibly argue, will so harden and degrade {{the minds of}} those that practise it. And yet we ourselves make much the same appearance {{in the eyes of the}} Buddhist and the vegetarian. We consume the carcases of creatures of like appetites, passions, and organs with ourselves; we feed on babes, though not our own; and the slaughter-house resounds daily with screams of pain and fear. We distinguish, indeed; but the unwillingness of many nations to eat the dog, an animal with whom we live on terms of the next intimacy, shows how precariously the distinction is grounded. The pig is the main element of animal food among the islands; and I had many occasions, my mind being quickened by my cannibal surroundings, to observe his character and the manner of his death. Many islanders live with their pigs as we do with our dogs; both crowd around the hearth with equal freedom; and the island pig is a fellow of activity, enterprise, and sense. He husks his own cocoa-nuts, and (I am told) rolls them into the sun to burst; he is the terror of the shepherd. Mrs. Stevenson, senior, has seen one fleeing to the woods with a lamb in his mouth; and I saw another come rapidly (and erroneously) to the conclusion that the Casco was going down, and swim through the <b>flush</b> <b>water</b> to the rail in search of an escape. It was told us in childhood that pigs cannot swim; I have known one to leap overboard, swim five hundred yards to shore, and return to the house of his original owner. I was once, at Tautira, a pig-master on a considerable scale; at first, in my pen, the utmost good feeling prevailed; a little sow with a belly-ache came and appealed to us for help in the manner of a child; and there was one shapely black boar, whom we called Catholicus, for he was a particular present from the Catholics of the village, and who early displayed the marks of courage and friendliness; no other animal, whether dog or pig, was suffered to approach him at his food, and for human beings he showed a full measure of that toadying fondness, so common in the lower animals, and possibly their chief title to the name. One day, on visiting my piggery, I was amazed to see Catholicus draw back from my approach with cries of terror; and if I was amazed at the change, I was truly embarrassed when I learnt its reason. One of the pigs had been that morning killed; Catholicus had seen the murder, he had discovered he was dwelling in the shambles, and from that time his confidence and his delight in life were ended. We still reserved him a long while, but he could not endure the sight of any two-legged creature, nor could we, under the circumstances, encounter his eye without confusion. I have assisted besides, by the ear, at the act of butchery itself; the victim's cries of pain I think I could have borne, but the execution was mismanaged, and his expression of terror was contagious: that small heart moved to the same tune with ours. Upon such [...] "dread foundations" [...] the life of the European reposes, and yet the European is among the less cruel of races. The paraphernalia of murder, the preparatory brutalities of his existence, are all hid away; an extreme sensibility reigns upon the surface; and ladies will faint at the recital of one tithe of what they daily expect of their butchers. Some will be even crying out upon me in their hearts for the coarseness of this paragraph. And so with the island cannibals. They were not cruel; apart from this custom, they are a race of the most kindly; rightly speaking, to cut a man's flesh after he is dead is far less hateful than to oppress him whilst he lives; and even the victims of their appetite were gently used in life and suddenly and painlessly despatched at last. In island circles of refinement it was doubtless thought bad taste to expatiate on what was ugly in the practice.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - To {{determine}} the domestic <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> consumption for a building development. Design/methodology/approach - A statistic mathematical model is proposed {{and the model}} parameters are sampled with the Monte Carlo sampling technique. The frequency distribution of the parameters for Hong Kong is identified from the survey results of the water closet usage patterns in five typical residential building estates. In particular, the density function of the diurnal variations of occupant load and flushes per occupant, and the cistern volume of the water closets in 597 apartments are used to establish the model. Findings - The <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> consumption of the residential developments in Hong Kong is determined and compared with the measurement result of typical residential buildings. Research limitations/implications - The model parameters are not exhaustive and are determined from surveys in Hong Kong, which perhaps limits the model's usefulness elsewhere. Practical implications - A useful source of reference in determining the domestic <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> consumption of building developments for those involved in building design and management related to the <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> systems of residential buildings.

In order for energy saving strategies, the aquatic-polycarbonate skylight system is used in the tropical climate.

Ironically, most of the commercial and institution buildings are equipped with Western skylight styles in Surabaya without any modifications. The aquatic-polycarbonate skylight is the system that will control daylight, scatter direct solar heat radiation, cool the indoor polycarbonate surface temperature, and collect solar hot water at the same time. The concept of using the water as shading device has three goals: first of all, the <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> in the polycarbonate holes tries to scatter horizontal or tiled skylight direct sun-ray radiation, and minimize the direct sun heat temperature on the polycarbonate with <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> continuously. Secondly, the sparkle <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> in series of square holes of polycarbonate will bounce and disperse the direct sunlight into the space below enhancing daylight patterns. Finally, while bouncing, sparkling and scattering direct sunlight, those series of <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> holes would also collect the solar heat radiation as solar hot water. Each system could works nicely to absorb, to scatter, to minimize, and to obtain the solar heat radiation for solar hot water in buildings.

A 30 ‐day field {{study was conducted}} at Kansas State University to analyze the effect of four targeted flushing velocities (0. 23, 0. 30, 0. 46, and 0. 61 m/s) for a fixed 15 min duration of flushing and three flushing frequencies (no flushing or flushing every 15 or 30 days) on SDI emitter discharge and sediments within the dripline and removed in the <b>flushing</b> <b>water.</b> At {{the end of the}} field experiment (371 h), the amount of solids carried away by the <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> and retained in every lateral were determined as well as laboratory determination of emitter discharge for every single emitter within each dripline. Greater dripline flushing velocities, which also resulted in greater flushing volumes, tended to result in greater amounts of solids in the <b>flushing</b> <b>water,</b> but the differences were not always statistically significant. Neither the frequency of flushing nor the interaction of flushing frequency and velocity significantly affected the amount of solids in the <b>flushing</b> <b>water.</b> There was a greater concentration of solids in the beginning one‐third of the 90 m laterals, particularly for treatments with no flushing or with slower dripline flushing velocities. As flushing velocity and concurrently flushing volume increased, there was a tendency for greater solids removal and/or more equal distribution within the dripline.
