25|$|The {{second major}} design of fibulae has a high, rounded arch (bogen in German) {{instead of the}} low <b>flat</b> <b>arch</b> of the violin bow fibula. At first, the bow was thin. In later {{variants}} the bow was made of thicker metal or of two pieces of thin wire twisted together. These rounded bow fibulae were first found in the 12th century BC, but lasted in use in some places {{for more than five}} centuries.|$|E
500|$|Both of the North and South West Lodges of Althorp date {{to around}} 1730 under Roger Morris and are both built from lias ashlar with slate roofs. The North and South East Lodges date to around 1810 and are built from {{limestone}} ashlar with slate roofs. All four buildings became Grade II listed buildings in November 1954. The Grade II listed Dairy Cottage, {{to the northwest}} of the lake, dates to the late 18th century under Henry Holland, and was listed in December 1986. It is a two-storey building with an attic and hipped roof. It has a 19th-century central door and a surrounding porch [...] "flanked by casements under <b>flat</b> <b>arch</b> heads".|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, the {{population}} of Minneapolis was growing rapidly, increasing 351 percent from 1880 to 1890. With {{the number of people}} moving into the city, lower-cost housing was needed for immigrants who were new to Minnesota. [...] The street had originally been platted as an alley between 22nd and 23rd Avenues South, but William Ragan developed it as a street and labeled it 22½ Avenue. [...] The houses were situated close together on narrow lots, with very narrow side yards and no front yards. [...] This almost gives the impression of rowhouses. [...] Most of the houses were built with brick veneer on timber frames, and they have uniform-sized roof slopes, modified <b>flat</b> <b>arch</b> windows, and open front porches.|$|E
50|$|The Bell Street Mall {{elevation}} {{is divided}} into three by changes in the detailing, brickwork and roofline. The western end has arched doorways with keystones to its base, and <b>flat</b> <b>arched</b> windows with exaggerated voussoirs either side of the triangular bay window above. The rest of the facade has more modest <b>flat</b> <b>arched</b> windows.|$|R

2500|$|The Pithole Stone Arch Bridge is a {{segmental}} arch bridge, spanning [...] over Pithole Creek. The bridge is unusual for its short span and a <b>flat</b> <b>arch</b> that rises only [...] Also unusual are the bridge's massive abutments {{and for its}} being well-built for only a rural backroad. The bridge was constructed using ashlar that was [...] "coursed", meaning each successive layer of stone had a different height, but the stone in each layer had the same height. A total of 628square perches(15,543ft2; 1,444m2) of sandstone {{were used in the}} bridge.|$|E
60|$|The cabin's {{interior}} pleased Wayland {{almost as}} much as the garden. It was built of pine logs neatly matched and hewed on one side. There were but two rooms--one which served as sleeping-chamber and office, and one which was at once kitchen and dining-room. In the larger room a quaint fireplace with a <b>flat</b> <b>arch,</b> a bunk, a table supporting a typewriter, and several shelves full of books made up the furnishing. On the walls hung a rifle, a revolver in its belt, a couple of uniforms, and a yellow oilskin raincoat.|$|E

I describe facts or semblances, not operations. I say [...] "seem to have been," [...] not [...] "have been." [...] I say [...] "are bent;" [...] I do not say [...] "have been bent." [...] Most travellers must remember {{the entrance to the}} valley of Cluse, from the plain of Bonneville, on the road from Geneva to Chamouni. They remember that immediately after entering it they find a great precipice on their left, not less than two thousand feet in perpendicular height. That precipice is formed by beds of limestone bent like a rainbow, as in Fig. 10. Their edges constitute the cliff; the <b>flat</b> <b>arch</b> which they form with their backs is covered with pine forests and meadows, extending for three or four leagues in the direction of Sixt. Whether the whole mountain was called out of nothing into the form it possesses, or created first {{in the form of a}} level mass, and then actually bent and broken by external force, is quite irrelevant to our present purpose; but it is impossible to describe its form without appearing to imply the latter alternative; and all the distinct evidence which can be obtained upon the subject points to such a conclusion, although there are certain features in such mountains which, up to the present time, have rendered all positive conclusion impossible, not because they contradict the theories in question, but because they are utterly inexplicable on any theory whatever.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} porch {{accessed by}} wide steps is indicated with colossal columns and high arches. On the upper veranda a distinctive balance and decorative accent pattern is achieved with the lintels of pairs of <b>flat</b> <b>arched</b> dwarf.|$|R

50|$|On 3 May 1830 the world's first {{passenger}} train service, the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway (6 miles) built by George Stephenson, began, hauled by the locomotive Invicta and introduced world's first railway season ticket in 1834. Maidenhead Railway Bridge, {{known for its}} <b>flat</b> <b>arch,</b> was built in 1839 with 39-metre spans. The Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment, in Chertsey, developed Chobham armour.|$|E
50|$|Erected in 1935 U Block, {{adjacent}} to Old Government House, is a long, imposing, three-storey, facebrick building {{resting on a}} rusticated freestone base facing the Main Drive and overlooking the City Botanic Gardens. Symmetrical about a giant order Ionic portico entrance, the building is approached by a wide sweep of concrete stairs from the Main Drive. The main wing terminates in rectangular pavilions which extend to the west forming a courtyard {{to the rear of}} the building. Two sets of stairs parallel to the front elevation arrive at minor entrances to the front of each end pavilion. Giant order, rendered pilasters divide the front elevation into ten bays of <b>flat</b> <b>arched,</b> four-pane casement windows with fanlights. The other elevations have a similar rhythm of pilasters and fenestration and the blind west elevations of the pavilions are defined by paired rendered pilasters. The west elevation is symmetrical about a <b>flat</b> <b>arched,</b> freestone entrance porch below a double height vertical stairwell window.|$|R

The width and thickness of the nail plate is determined by the size, length, and thickness of the matrix, while the shape of the fingertip itself shows if the nail plate is <b>flat,</b> <b>arched,</b> or hooked. The matrix will continue to grow as long as it receives nutrition and remains in a healthy condition.|$|R
5000|$|The Albert Bridge is {{a bridge}} in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Its three <b>flat</b> <b>arches</b> span the River Lagan {{and it is}} one of eight bridges in the city. It was {{completed}} in 1890 by Belfast city surveyor J C Bretland [...] after two arches of the previous bridge suddenly collapsed in 1886. It is located close to the city centre between East Bridge Street and the Albert Bridge Road.|$|R
50|$|Between 1952 and 1954, a {{competition}} {{for the construction of}} a new bridge was held, and the plan of the architects George Giuseppe Gori, Enzo Gori and Ernesto Nelli and of engineer Riccardo Morandi was chosen. The plan called for three spans in a thin, <b>flat</b> <b>arch</b> over two piers which supports the roadway. The final effect gives the impression of a single, slightly curved span. Construction on the bridge was completed in 1957.|$|E
50|$|A Georgian house, Bucklebury Manor {{was built}} on the estate in the 1830s.
