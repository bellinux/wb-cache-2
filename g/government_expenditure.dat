As a result of these trends, the ageing of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget. Relatively few young Australians consider joining the military and the ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are able to offer higher salaries.|$|E

This method is applied in order to empirically estimate the long run relationship between <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> and private investment. The empirical evidences suggest that there is a long-run relationship between variables and <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> tended to crowd-out private investment. JEL Classification: E 62 Keywords: <b>Government</b> <b>Expenditures,</b> Private Investment, Cointegration, Turkey Introduction In recent years, the relationship between the <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> and private investment has been investigated and several studies have been published. The impact of <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> on private investment is explained on two hands. On the one hand, an increase in <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> due to high government borrowing requirements displaces the private investment. This indicates the “crowding out” hypothesis. Hence, the high level of <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> crowds out private investment. On the other hand, since public investments enhance the marginal productivity of private capital, this increases the level of private investment (Mamatzakis, 2001) In the literature there are two types studies and all studies found different results on the effects of <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> on private investment. The contrasting results from different studies gave rise to several studies try to investigate the impact of <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> on private investment. Aschauer (1989); Mamatzakis (2001); Pereira (2001); Ghali (1998) Apergis (2000); Laopodis (2001); Karagol (2004) and Pereira (2001) used a disaggregate analysis in order to explain the relationship between disaggregate measures of <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> and private investment. On the other hand, only a few studies used an aggregate analysis. Lin (1994) states that increased in <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> made private investments costly because of competing the private sector in financing. The results strongly indicate that <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> crowd out private investment in Turkey. Following the above remarks, {{the purpose of this study}} is to investigate the relationship between <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> and private investments.

On 5 June 1821, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general Jorge Avilez (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted.

Nash took responsibility for design and valuation of all properties. Construction of the road resulted in demolishing numerous properties, disrupting trade and polluting the air with dust. Existing tenants had first offer to purchase leases on the new properties. The Treasury supported the proposal because, in the aftermath of the lengthy Napoleonic Wars, there was an urgent need for the government to create jobs. <b>Government</b> <b>expenditure</b> was low because the design relied heavily upon private developers, such as Nash himself. The buildings were to be let on 99-year leases, as was common at the time, and income could be recouped in the form of ground rent.|$|E

It covers the most recent time period between 1982 and 2011 and use advanced static and dynamic econometric models to test validity of the Hypothesis for Chinese economy. After determining the stationarity of the series and confirm the existence of the long term relationship between the variables by using the Bounds test approach, we examine the long and short run relationship between <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> and GDP using an ARDL model. The ARDL (1, 2) model suggests that 1 percentage point increase in GDP will lead to 1. 63 percentage points surge in <b>government</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Finally, we use the Kalman filter to investigate the dynamic relationship between <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> and GDP. According to the Kalman filter model, the income elasticity of <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> remains between 1. 32 and 1. 38. Since the elasticity is found larger than 1 in both static and dynamic models, we conclude that Wagner’s Hypothesis is valid for China during the 1982 - 2011 period...|$|R
