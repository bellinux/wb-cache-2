For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths of Gender, explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of <b>gender.</b> <b>In</b> Delusions of Gender, Cordelia Fine disputes {{scientific evidence that}} {{suggests that there is}} an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and <b>gender</b> <b>in</b> their research.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{regard the}} badnjak customs as practises {{inherited}} from the old Slavic religion. In the pre-Christian religion of the Serbs, as shown by Serbian scholar Veselin Čajkanović, there were trees seen as dwelling places of spirits or divinities. Čajkanović argues that there were also trees seen as divinities per se. He considers the badnjak as a convincing example of the latter. Salutations, prayers, and sacrifices such as grain, wine, and honey are offered to him (the name badnjak is of masculine <b>gender</b> <b>in</b> Serbian); he is consistently treated not as a tree but as a person.|$|E

30|$|The {{move from}} {{housewife}} to full-time wife signals the changing <b>gender</b> order <b>in</b> China.

At that time, the traditional <b>gender</b> order <b>in</b> the family was neglected and repressed. The term full-time wife embodies an acceptance of the traditional <b>gender</b> order <b>in</b> the family and also the <b>gender</b> inequality <b>in</b> the labor market, which reflects a combination of the traditional <b>gender</b> order <b>in</b> the private sphere and the market-constructed <b>gender</b> order <b>in</b> the public sphere.|$|R

5|$|Some {{academic}} researchers {{argue that}} the actual efficacy of SJS is obscured by poor research methodology. Specifically, demographic characteristics used to predict juror attitudes and juror verdicts may not hold true across all kinds of cases. For example, men convict more frequently than women in some types of criminal trials but less frequently in others. Besides this, demographic characteristics are often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than <b>gender</b> <b>in</b> rape trials.|$|E

5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect, vol. 5, and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for <b>gender</b> <b>in</b> sexual partners.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gender</b> {{differences}} <b>in</b> conversation topics {{were first}} systematically studied in 1922 by Henry Moore, who theorized that the <b>gender</b> differences <b>in</b> topic choice he {{observed in a}} field observation study would persist over time, as they were manifestations of men's and women's “original natures. ” In this paper, I report a 1990 replication of Moore's study, in which similar but smaller <b>gender</b> differences <b>in</b> topic choice are found. In order to explore further the apparent trend toward smaller gender differences, reports of quantitative observation studies conducted between 1922 and 1990 are examined. Other explanations besides change over time—such as variations in conversation setting and audience, target populations, and researcher's intentions—may account for the decline <b>in</b> <b>gender</b> differences <b>in</b> topic choice. Social influences are seen more clearly in the discourse about <b>gender</b> differences <b>in</b> conversation than <b>in</b> <b>gender</b> differences <b>in</b> conversation topics themselves...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores <b>gender</b> {{differences}} <b>in</b> smoking {{using information}} on 15, 277 adults {{obtained from the}} Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys of 2001 and 2005. Applying a decomposition approach extended from the Oaxaca-Blinder method, we obtained factors influencing <b>gender</b> differences <b>in</b> smoking and estimated their separate contributions. According to the outcomes of decomposition analyses, <b>gender</b> differences <b>in</b> smoking-tendency (or inclination to smoke) accounted for 98 % of the total <b>gender</b> difference <b>in</b> smoking. When the <b>gender</b> difference <b>in</b> smoking was decomposed into specified factors, the difference in smoking-tendency between married men and women {{was found to be}} the most crucial factor as it explained 11 % of the total <b>gender</b> difference <b>in</b> smoking. The <b>gender</b> difference <b>in</b> the proportion of persons attaining a low level of education contributed to a 6 % reduction of the total <b>gender</b> difference <b>in</b> smoking. Additionally, factors influencing the gender-specific smoking-tendency were found to be important <b>in</b> explaining the <b>gender</b> difference <b>in</b> smoking. We conclude that, understanding separate contributions of sets of factors affecting <b>gender</b> differences <b>in</b> smoking and devising appropriate policies could effectively reduce the smoking rate of a target gender group to the level of that of a reference gender group.

5|$|Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, {{mineralization}} located {{inside the}} medulla {{of the long}} bones in gravid female birds) {{has been reported in}} at least one Allosaurus specimen, a shin bone from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply calcium to shells. Its presence in the Allosaurus individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this Allosaurus individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this Allosaurus individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead. However, with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating <b>gender</b> <b>in</b> a specimen of Tyrannosaurus, {{it may be possible to}} ascertain whether or not the Allosaurus in question was indeed female.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{historians have}} taken new {{approaches}} to analyzing both traditional and modern Ethiopian historiography. For instance, Donald Crummey (1941–2013) investigated instances in Ethiopian historiography dealing with class, ethnicity, and gender. He also criticized earlier approaches made by Sylvia Pankhurst (1882–1960) and Richard Pankhurst (1927–2017), who focused primarily on the Ethiopian ruling class while ignoring marginalized peoples and minority groups in Ethiopian historical works. Following the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution and overthrow of the Solomonic dynasty with the deposition of Haile Selassie, the historical materialism of Marxist historiography came to dominate the academic landscape and understanding of Northeast African history. In her 2001 article Women in Ethiopian History: A Bibliographic Review, Belete Bizuneh remarks {{that the impact of}} social history on African historiography in the 20th century generated an unprecedented focus on the roles of women and <b>gender</b> <b>in</b> historical societies, but that Ethiopian historiography seems to have fallen outside the orbit of these historiographic trends.|$|E
5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of <b>gender</b> <b>in</b> research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E
