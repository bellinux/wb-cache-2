5000|$|Farringdon has close {{associations}} {{with two of}} Britain's most celebrated figures, the novelist Jane Austen (1775-1817) and the naturalist Gilbert White (1720-1793). Austen would come {{from her home in}} nearby Chawton, a little over a mile to the north, to visit friends and acquaintances in Farringdon. From 1761 to 1785 White was curate of Farringdon's village church of All Saints, and his pulpit still survives. One of the parish registers contains entries in his handwriting. Gilbert White's house, now a museum, is a little over three miles west of Farringdon. All Saints has Norman and 12th/13th century origins and retains <b>good</b> <b>stained</b> windows. The churchyard contains yew trees reputed to be of great antiquity; the hollow nature of the trees makes ring-counting dating impossible, but estimates have suggested that the trees may be as much as 2,000 years old.|$|R

50|$|Endospore {{staining}} is {{a technique}} used in bacteriology to identify the presence of endospores in a bacterial sample, which can be useful for classifying bacteria. Within bacteria, endospores are protective structures used to survive extreme conditions, but this protective nature makes them difficult to stain using normal techniques. Special techniques for endospore staining include the Schaeffer-Fulton stain and the Moeller <b>stain.</b> A <b>good</b> <b>stain</b> to use for spore staining is malachite green. It {{takes a long time}} for the spores to stain due to their density, so time acts as the mordant when doing this differential stain; the slide with the bacterium should be soaked in malachite green for at least 30 minutes. Water acts as the decolorizer. A counterstain to differentiate the vegetative cells is 0.5% safranin.Types of endospores that could be identified are free endospores, central endospores, central and swollen endospores, and subterminal endospores. One obstacle of this stain is if staining Mycobacterium because due to its thick wax coats, some cells will stain green, looking positive for spores although this particular bacterium does not produce any.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Skeletal {{staining}} {{is a way}} {{to study}} the effect of many chemical or herbal substances on development of bones and cartilages in order to record the level of probable deformity. This article aimed to present a modified protocol to make all skeletal studies on laboratory animals possible. Materials and Methods: The important notes about skeletal staining were fixing by ethanol and clearing by potassium hydroxide in embryonic and newborn samples. In adults it was fixing by neutral formalin buffer, then ethanol after washing the samples in ddH 2 O, and clearing the samples by trypsin and potassium hydroxide in separated stages. The amount of colors used for cartilages and bones was different in animals with different ages for a <b>good</b> <b>stained</b> sample. Results: The mentioned procedures resulted incompletely clear stained samples whose skeletal parts, i. e. cartilages and bones, were stained blue and red, respectively. Conclusion: Although most reviewed investigations have used the same protocol in different laboratory animals with different ages, the used materials and also their concentrations for skeletal staining procedures differ in embryos and adults...|$|R

40|$|The Gallyas {{method is}} a silver {{impregnation}} technique {{that is essential}} {{in the field of}} neuropathology because of its high sensitivity for the detection of argentophilic inclusion bodies in the central nervous system. In Japan, the Gallyas method has improved and is widely used as the “modified Gallyas method”. However, this method is not popularly used in general pathology laboratories because of the need for special reagents, several staining processes, and skilled techniques. The objective of the current study was to provide a simplified Gallyas method. We omitted the lan-thanum nitrate step from the staining process and verified the adequacy in comparison with the original method as well as immunohistochemistry, using specimens from patients of Alzheimer’s disease, argyrophilic grain disease, multiple system atrophy, Pick’s disease, and Lewy body disease. The simplified method provided <b>good</b> <b>staining</b> to all the structures in archival tissues, compared with the modi-fied Gallyas method in a significantly shorter staining time.

40|$|Background: In routine histopathology, {{decalcification}} {{of teeth}} {{is an essential}} and important step during tissue processing. The present study was attempted to decalcify teeth using microwave method and to compare it with conventional decalcification method. Aim: To compare microwave decalcification with conventional decalcification method {{with respect to the}} speed of decalcification, preservation of tissue structure, and efficacy of staining. Materials and Methods: A total of 72 single-rooted premolars were used for both conventional and microwave decalcification methods. Three different types of decalcifying agents at 5 % and 7 % were used. Decalcifying agents included nitric acid, formic acid, and trichloroacetic acid, each at 5 % and 7 %. About 6 teeth were included in each category and were decalcified by both conventional and microwave method. After decalcification, all the teeth were examined macroscopically and microscopically. Cramer′s V-test was used to determine the statistical significance. Results: The results have shown that microwave method using 5 % and 7 % nitric acid were the fastest. Structural details and <b>good</b> <b>staining</b> characteristics were better in teeth decalcified by 5 % nitric acid and 5 % trichloroacetic acid by both the methods.

40|$|AIMS: To provide cytospins as a {{means of}} {{external}} quality assurance (EQA), while maintaining antigen expression integrity and achieving uniformity of material for all participating laboratories. METHODS: Cells were collected from two adenocarcinoma and one reactive pleural effusion specimens. Lymphoid cells were also collected through aspiration of a resected tonsil specimen. All cells were collected in Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS); cytospins were made and fixed in methanol or acetone alone or protected using a layer of 10 % polyethylene glycol (PEG) in 50 % methanol. Two laboratories participated (RGHT and UCL). RESULTS: Cytokeratin expression detected using either CAM 5. 2 or AE 1 /AE 3 antibodies was sensitive to temperature. Without PEG, unacceptable or negative staining was seen within six weeks of preparation. LCA was not sensitive to temperature, with <b>good</b> <b>staining</b> scores being achieved after eight weeks following preparation. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to send alcohol fixed, air dried cytospins to laboratories participating as part of an EQA scheme for immunocytology.
