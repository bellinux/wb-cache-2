40|$|In recent years, spur dikes are {{expected}} to demonstrate various functions. Permeating flow through the spur dike can control the flow field, structures of separation vortex and bed configuration around the spur dikes. In this study, velocity fields behind the solid, straightly permeating and <b>inclined</b> permeating <b>spur</b> dikes are measured and compared. The resistance and scour depth {{at the head of}} the spur dike are reduced by the permeating flow through the dike. <b>Spur</b> dikes with <b>inclined</b> permeating flow were proved to have several advantages. The inclined permeating flow reduces the strength of the separation vortex, keeping almost similar deceleration effect and reattachment length.

It {{was one of}} a series of very high dams built in Europe in the two decades after World War II; these were designed with a <b>downstream</b> face <b>inclined</b> toward the upstream flow. This simplified the dam's design and construction (although it required more concrete to build), and more readily incorporated the spillways into the dam face. The dam's face is nearly vertical. Design work on the dam began in 1956, and construction completed in 1963. The structure was built by the Iberdrola Ingeniería y Construcción construction firm. Pedro Martínez Artola was the design engineer. The dam was built on high-quality granite rock. During construction, grouting was used to fill cracks in the rock which ran parallel to the dam's foundation, and on the Portuguese bank where two fractures in the rock occurred.|$|R

40|$|Modeling of the seepage {{history of}} DNAPLs is {{investigated}} as a new, non-invasive site investigation tool {{in order to}} elucidate the possible position of still unknown DNAPL source zone at many investigated industrial sites. Therefore, the spatio-temporal spreading behavior of the DNAPL TCE is studied with the multiphase modeling software TMVOC in small and large scale 2 D multiphase scenarios with varying parameter sets concerning groundwater flow, composition of aquifers and aquitards and subsurface morphologies, as depressions and trenches. The small scale models were calibrated by laboratory experiments conducted at La Sapienza University, Rome. They exhibited that even groundwater pore velocities of vw = 0. 05 m/d have a strong impact on the spreading behavior and {{the position of a}} DNAPL body. <b>Downstream</b> <b>inclined</b> percolation path ways, enhanced dissolution rates and lateral transportation in downstream direction are the most dominant impacts. Small scale layering of the subsoil with horizontal lenses of impermeable materials affects the distribution pattern only slightly at vw > 5 m/d, which are common flow velocities in many gravelly aquifers in Europe. Upscaling of the models to field scale problems exhibited potential transportation length in downstream direction of several hundreds of meters, assuming a moderate spill rate of ca. 3 kg/day over an area of several square meters. Investigating real subsurface morphology including real material parameters provided by the ModelPROBE reference site Chimica di Bianchi in Rho, Italy, revealed that the DNAPL TCE will be transported out of moderate depressions (slope of 2. 5 °) even at groundwater flow velocities of vw ≤ 1 m/d, which is in the range of documented groundwater flow velocities at the reference site. Moreover, the documented material classes, which comprise the aquitard at the site, are not in general impermeable for percolating DNAPLs. Only pure clays with a hydraulic conductivity of kf ≤ 10 - 9 m/s are long-term barriers for vertical DNAPL percolation. The conducted investigations deliver a reasonable explanation for the often unknown position of DNAPL source zones at former industrial sites and are, as far as it is known, the first large scale scenarios of DNAPL spreading behavior in real subsurface morphology. Based on the conducted research it can be concluded that at the reference site Chimica di Bianchi the main mass of DNAPLs was not at the assumed hot spot, which was encapsulated in the 1980 s, but probably migrated considerable distances in downstream direction, passing through or following partly the topography of the aquitard. But the applicability of multiphase modeling as additional non-invasive site investigation tool is still challenging due to software restriction concerning size and resolution of the models and handling of heterogeneous permeability fields...|$|R

These include fuel-air mixing processes, ignition initiation and extinction, flame holding and effect of off-design variation on these phenomena. Since ground and flight tests {{are very difficult to}} perform in this environment, simulations {{play a key role in}} augmenting development. However, several uncertainties arise in the modeling and inter-pretation of numerical simulations. In addition to accuracy and physical consistency issues, simplifying assumptions play a major role in the interpretation of the results. In this paper, exploratory simulations are described with unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for initial combustion phenomena in a generic circular cross-section combustor employing an axisymmetric cavity flameholder. Both frozen and finite rate chemical kinetics are considered, the latter with a 20 -reaction, 13 -specie model for ethene-air mixture.

40|$|The {{stringing}} regulation on {{greenhouse gases}} emissions {{coupled with the}} rising fuel price and the growth in aviation transportation have imposed increasing demands on the aircraft industry to develop revolutionary technologies to meet such challenges. Methods of delaying flow separation on aircraft high lift systems have been sought {{which can lead to}} an increase in the aircraft performance and ultimately a reduction in aircraft operational costs {{and its impact on the}} environment. Synthetic jet actuators are a promising method of delivering flow control for aircraft applications due to their ability to inject momentum to an external flow without net mass flux and their potential in being integrated in MEMS through micro-fabrication with relative ease. It has been demonstrated in many laboratory experiments that synthetic jets are capable of delaying flow separation on aerodynamic bodies of various shapes. However, currently the operating conditions of synthetic jets are mostly chosen by trial-and-error, and thus the flow control effectiveness varies from one experiment to another. In order to deliver an effective flow separation control which achieves a desired control effect at minimum energy expenditure, a better understanding of the fluid mechanics of the behaviour of synthetic jets and the interaction between synthetic jets and a boundary layer are required. The aims of the present research were to achieve such a goal through a series of purposely designed numerical simulations. Firstly, synthetic jets issued from a circular orifice into quiescent air were studied to understand the effect of dimensionless parameters on the formation and the extent of roll-up of vortex rings. The computational results confirmed that the Stokes number determines the strength of vortex roll-up of a synthetic jet. Based on the computational results, a parameter map was produced in which three different operational regimes of synthetic jets were indentified and a criterion for vortex roll-up was also established. A circular synthetic jet issued into a zero-pressure-gradient laminar boundary layer was then investigated. The capability of FLUENT in modelling the key characteristics of synthetic jets was validated using experimental data. The formation and evolution of coherent structures produced by the interaction between synthetic jets and a boundary layer, as well as their near-wall effect in terms of the wall shear stress, were examined. A parameter map illustrating how the appearance of the vortical structures and their corresponding shear stress patterns vary as the synthetic jet operating condition changes was established. In addition, the increase in the wall shear stress relative to the jet-off case was calculated to evaluate their potential separation control effect. Finally, the study moved one step forward to investigate the flow separation control effect of an array of three circular synthetic jets issued into a laminar boundary layer which separates <b>downstream</b> on an <b>inclined</b> plate. The impact of synthetic jets on the boundary layer prior to separation and the extent of flow separation delay on the flap, at a range of synthetic jet operating conditions, were examined and the correlation between them was investigated. Furthermore, the optimal operating conditions for this synthetic jet array in the current study were identified by considering both the flow control effect and the actuator power consumption. The characteristics of the corresponding vortical structures were also examined. The findings from this work have produced some further insights of the behaviour and the interaction between synthetic jets and a boundary layer, which will be useful for ensuring an effective application of synthetic jets in practical settings.
