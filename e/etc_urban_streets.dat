40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to develop a}} methodology to estimate the temporal Environmental Traffic Capacity (<b>ETC)</b> for <b>urban</b> <b>streets.</b> The approach constitutes the main procedure of ETC calculation and an experimental process of developing an emission inventory. The major contribution of this study includes results that support the development of traffic control policies to alleviate the negative impacts of on-road emission sources, and suggestions for future research to optimize road capacity with respect to air quality. A framework is proposed for the combination of the traffic volume model developed in this dissertation with the Danish OSPM (Operational Street Pollution Model), a dispersion model, to calculate the ETC. The time-dependent traffic volume is connected with the time-dependent ETC via the average speed generated by a traffic speed-flow model. The basis for estimating the ETC is an inverse modeling of the OSPM. This method is improved by a further inverse modeling of the traffic volume model, which was developed in this research, to obtain the values of ETC for each hour under consideration. An experimental process is designed {{for the development of a}} weight-based emission inventory. A probability approach is applied to calculate the emission factors based on speed and acceleration variations. This method results in a weighted-emission inventory by a series of speed-acceleration combinations, for each of three categories of test vehicles, of CO 2, CO, HC, and NOx emissions. Using a real-site case study, the implementation of the methodology to estimate the ETC of a road section in a congested area for ten consecutive hours on a regular weekday is demonstrated. It has shown that the ETC is closely related to the joint effects of meteorology and traffic conditions. Two options of improvements using the ETC to relieve the traffic pollution are also presented at the end of the case study. The result indicates that increasing the speed limit of the whole area has better effect on reducing the traffic pollution than reconfiguring the physical dimension of the road section...|$|R
40|$|Street is {{a series}} of urban spaces, which are {{connected}} together to support a specific I' way of activities. The street becomes memorable when people are active in the street. Even though, people could not find any specifically designed places for outdoor activities in <b>urban</b> <b>streets.</b> Some places could be found which give more opportunities to use them as public spaces that can be adapted for many purposes even in Sri Lanka. Nowadays, urban designers are giving less consideration to-the-se important entities when they design places for people. As a result, the built environment is being affected with loss of intimacy. The man - environment relationship is being divorced at many of our <b>urban</b> <b>streets.</b> This is ever clear when thinking of diminishing of responsive qualities in the <b>urban</b> <b>street.</b> In order to rebuild the bridge between those two conditions it will be vital to identify the role played by 'robustness' and the way it contributes to create a livable <b>urban</b> <b>street.</b> In this respect the robustness in the street architecture is identified and studied through a theoretical approach. First the responsiveness of the <b>urban</b> <b>street</b> is considered. Secondly the characteristics, determinant factors and modifying factors of robustness are identified.

40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>streets</b> {{classification}} {{systems are}} the basis for defining function and, in turn, the design criteria for the world’s streets networks. The traditional classification systems {{have been based on}} the mobility and access functions of roads for motor vehicle traffic. Other road users and road uses have been largely ignored in this important step of the road design process. The present paper proposes a novel generalization model for selecting characteristic <b>streets</b> in an <b>urban</b> <b>street</b> network. This model retains the central structure of a street network, it relies on a structural representation of a street network using graph principles where vertices represent named streets and links represent street intersections. Increasing the density in the <b>urban</b> <b>streets</b> causes the increase of the delay time of traveling, so the cities traffic management emphasizes that determining condition of the <b>urban</b> <b>streets</b> construction is a priority. The arrangement condition of the <b>urban</b> <b>streets</b> in the transportation network can affect the reliability and decrease the trip delay time. In this paper reliability is calculated, using probability theory according to the density and the delay caused by arrangement condition of the <b>urban</b> <b>streets</b> in the streets network. This model has been used for arrangement condition of <b>urban</b> intersections and <b>streets</b> and it has been examined...|$|R

40|$|A {{tremendous}} {{opportunity is}} emerging to greatly enhance the sustainability of urban areas by changing approaches to street design. In the United States there are four million miles of streets and highways. Street construction is expensive and consumes substantial material and energy resources during construction. In the U.

40|$|Today's <b>urban</b> <b>streets</b> {{are usually}} planned for {{purposes}} of mobility: pedestrians, {{as well as a}} variety of vehicles such as cars, trucks, and sometimes bicycles, are usually factored into an <b>urban</b> <b>street</b> plan. However, <b>urban</b> <b>streets</b> are also increasingly recognized as public spaces, accommodating street vending, food trucks, markets, artistic interventions, political expressions, comfortable benches, green spaces. Although these are mostly not new activities to appear on streets, they are now given particular attention in public discourses, urban planning, media and academia, as public space in cities has become a more contested resource among different uses and ownership-constellations. Growing and diversifying urban populations are generating a particular strain on <b>urban</b> <b>streets</b> worldwide. In short, <b>urban</b> <b>streets</b> epitomize the challenges and opportunities that accompany the negotiations of space and uses attributed to mobility and public space in cities. They necessarily unite stationary and mobile functions – though this is not usually given room for in planning. Moreover, these functions are rarely studied from more than one perspective at once, which limits the analytical and creative thinking that inspiration is drawn from. In order to address these limitations, in this article we rely on insights from three theoretical fields - namely planning regulation, transitions and governance - and illustrations from concrete examples, to explore what urban planning might have to focus on to address the tensions in linking stationary and mobile functions in <b>urban</b> <b>streets...</b>|$|R

40|$|Many complex {{networks}} {{demonstrate a}} phenomenon of striking degree correlations, i. e., a node tends to link to other nodes with similar (or dissimilar) degrees. From the perspective of degree correlations, this paper attempts to characterize topological structures of <b>urban</b> <b>street</b> networks. We adopted six <b>urban</b> <b>street</b> networks (three European and three North American), and converted them into network topologies in which nodes and edges respectively represent individual streets and street intersections, and compared the network topologies to three reference network topologies (biological, technological, and social). The <b>urban</b> <b>street</b> network topologies (with the exception of Manhattan) showed a consistent pattern that distinctly differs from the three reference networks. The topologies of <b>urban</b> <b>street</b> networks lack striking degree correlations in general. Through reshuffling the network topologies towards for example maximum or minimum degree correlations while retaining the initial degree distributions, we found that all the surrogate topologies of the <b>urban</b> <b>street</b> networks, {{as well as the}} reference ones, tended to deviate from small world properties. This implies that the initial degree correlations do not have any positive or negative effect on the networks' performance or functions.

The findings confirm that (1) both the wider range of flow dimension and the higher flow capacity can be a signature of small world networks, and (2) the flow capacity can be an alternative quantity for measuring the efficiency of networks or that of the individual nodes.

In this research an attempt {{has been made to}} establish a framework to define LOS criteria of <b>urban</b> <b>street</b> in Indian context keeping in mind the geometric and surrounding environmental characteristics. Defining LOS criteria is basically a classification problem for which cluster analysis is a suitable technique can be applied. In this research a hybrid algorithm comprising of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Fuzzy C-mean is utilized. As input to the clustering algorithm GA-Fuzzy a lot of speed data is required. From literature review GPS is found to be a suitable tool for collecting second by second speed data and GIS is suitable in handling large amount of speed data. The clustering algorithm is used twice in this study. First the GA-Fuzzy algorithm was used to classify Free Flow Speed (FFS) data into number of classes {{in order to get the}} FFS ranges of different <b>urban</b> <b>street</b> classes.
