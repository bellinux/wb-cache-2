40|$|Background: We {{conducted}} an audit {{to investigate the}} efficacy of a proposed standard operating procedure (SOP) on convective and conductive perioperative thermal management during paediatric cardiac anaesthesia. Methods: We retrospectively studied 26 consecutive children who underwent cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We applied a <b>heating</b> <b>mattress</b> and a forced-air blanket during anaesthesia induction, before CPB, during the rewarming period, and after discontinuation of CPB. Core body temperatures were recorded continuously. Results: All children (aged 1 day to 13. 5 yr, median 25 months) were divided into three groups: 15 kg (III, n = 9). Mean (± SD) core body temperatures were as follows: {{at the start of}} surgery 35. 8 ± 1. 0 °C (I), 35. 9 ± 0. 6 °C (II), and 36. 3 ± 0. 3 °C (III); at the start of bypass 35. 9 ± 1. 1 °C (I), 36. 4 ± 1. 1 °C (II), and 36. 5 ± 0. 7 °C (III). Temperatures after rewarming were 36. 4 ± 0. 4 °C (I), 36. 2 ± 0. 4 °C (II), and 36. 0 ± 0. 4 °C (III). After weaning from bypass, core body temperatures were 36. 7 ± 0. 9 °C (I), 37. 3 ± 0. 7 °C (II), and 37. 1 ± 0. 7 °C (III). Normothermia on admission to ICU was maintained in all but three small infants.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{describe}} the opinions of ambulance personnel regarding differences between using a <b>heated</b> <b>mattress</b> and a standard ambulance mattress. This study was an intervention study with pre- and post-evaluation. Evaluations of the opinions of personnel regarding the standard unheated mattress were conducted initially. After the intervention with new <b>heated</b> <b>mattresses,</b> follow-up evaluations were conducted. Ambulance personnel (n= 64) from an ambulance station in northern Sweden took part in the study, which ran from October 2014 until February 2016. There were differences in opinions regarding the standard unheated mattress and the new <b>heated</b> <b>mattress.</b> The evaluation of the proxy ratings by the personnel showed that the <b>heated</b> <b>mattress</b> was warmer than the standard mattress, more pleasant to lie on and that patients were happier and more relaxed than when the standard mattress was used. The ambulance personnel in this study rated the experience of working with the <b>heated</b> <b>mattress</b> as very positive and proxy rated that it had a good effect on patient comfort.

40|$|Background: Exposure to cold {{temperatures}} is, often, {{a neglected}} problem in prehospital care. One {{of the leading}} influences of the overall sensation of cold discomfort is the cooling of the back. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of a heated ambulance mattress-prototype on body temperatures and thermal comfort in an experimental study. Method: Data were collected during four days in November, 2011 inside and outside of a cold chamber. All participants (n = 23) participated in two trials each. In one trial, they were lying on a stretcher with a supplied <b>heated</b> <b>mattress</b> and in the other trial without a <b>heated</b> <b>mattress.</b> Outcomes were back temperature, finger temperature, core body temperature, Cold Discomfort Scale (CDS), four statements from the state-trait anxiety - inventory (STAI), and short notes of their experiences of the two mattresses. Data were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. A repeated measure design was used to evaluate the effect of the two mattresses. Results: A statistical difference between the regular <b>mattress</b> and the <b>heated</b> <b>mattress</b> was found in the back temperature. In the <b>heated</b> <b>mattress</b> trial, the statement "I am tense" was fewer whereas the statements "I feel comfortable", "I am relaxed" and "I feel content" were higher in the <b>heated</b> <b>mattress</b> trial. The qualitative analyses of the short notes showed that the <b>heated</b> <b>mattress,</b> when compared to the unheated mattress, was experienced as warm, comfortable, providing security and was easier to relax on.

40|$|Background Patients’ cold {{exposure}} is a neglected problem in prehospital emergency care. Cold stress increases pain and anxiety {{and contributes to}} fear and an overall sense of dissatisfaction. When left untreated, cold stress disturbs vital body functions until ultimately reaches hypothermia. Aim The overall aim was to investigate patients’ experiences of thermal comfort and reactions to cold exposure in prehospital emergency care and to evaluate the effects of an intervention using active warming from underneath. Method Study I: Persons (n= 20) injured in a cold environment {{in the north of}} Sweden were interviewed. Active heat was given to 13 of them. Study II: In wintertime, 62 patients were observed during prehospital emergency care. The field study was based on observations, questions about thermal discomfort, vital signs, and temperature measurements. Study III: Healthy young persons (n= 23) participated in two trials each. Data were collected inside and outside a cold chamber. In one trial, the participants were lying on a regular ambulance stretcher and in a second trial on a stretcher supplied with a <b>heated</b> <b>mattress.</b> Outcomes were the Cold Discomfort Scale (CDS), back, finger, and core body temperature, four statements from the State-TraitAnxiety-Inventory (STAI), vital signs, and short notes about their experiences of the two stretchers. Study IV: A quantitative intervention study was conducted in prehospital emergency care in the north of Sweden. The patients (n= 30) in the intervention group were transported in an ambulance supplemented with a <b>heated</b> <b>mattress</b> on the stretcher, whereas only a regular stretcher was used in the ambulance for the patients (n= 30) in the control group. Outcomes were the CDS, finger, core body, and air temperature, and questions about cold experiences. Results Study I: Patients suffered more because of the cold than from the pain of their injuries. The patients were in a desperate need of heat. Study II: Patients are exposed to cold stress due to cold environments. There was a significant decrease from the first measurement in finger temperature of patients who were indoors when the ambulance arrived, compared to the measurement taken in the ambulance. In the patient compartment of the ambulance, 85 % of the patients had a finger temperature below the comfort zone and almost half of them experienced the patient compartment in the ambulance to be cold. The regular mattress surface temperature at the ambulance ranged from - 22. 3 to 8. 4 ºC. Study III: A statistical increase of the participants’ back temperature was found between those lying on the <b>heated</b> <b>mattress</b> compared to those lying on the regular <b>mattress.</b> The <b>heated</b> <b>mattress</b> was experienced as warm, comfortable, providing security, and easy to relax on. Study IV: Thermal comfort increased for the patients in the intervention group and decreased in the control group. A significant higher proportion of the participants rated the stretcher as cold to lie on in the control group compared to the intervention group. Conclusion The ambulance milieu is too cold to provide thermal comfort. Heat supply from underneath increased comfort and might prevent cold stress and hypothermi...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{ambulance}} milieu {{does not}} offer good thermal comfort to patients during the cold Swedish winters. Patients' exposure to cold temperatures combined with a cold ambulance mattress {{seems to be the}} major factor leading to an overall sensation of discomfort. There is little research on the effect of active heat delivered from underneath in ambulance care. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of an electrically heated ambulance mattress-prototype on thermal comfort and patients' temperatures in the prehospital emergency care. METHODS: A quantitative intervention study on ambulance care was conducted in the north of Sweden. The ambulance used for the intervention group (n= 30) was equipped with an electrically <b>heated</b> <b>mattress</b> on the regular ambulance stretcher whereas for the control group (n= 30) no active heat was provided on the stretcher. Outcome variables were measured as thermal comfort on the Cold Discomfort Scale (CDS), subjective comments on cold experiences, and finger, ear and air temperatures. RESULTS: Thermal comfort, measured by CDS, improved during the ambulance transport to the emergency department in the intervention group (p= 0. 001) but decreased in the control group (p= 0. 014). A significant higher proportion (57 %) of the control group rated the stretcher as cold to lie down compared to the intervention group (3 %, p< 0. 001). At arrival, finger, ear and compartment air temperature showed no statistical significant difference between groups. Mean transport time was approximately 15 minutes.

40|$|Background While the {{neonatal}} {{unit and}} incubator environment {{are essential for}} preterm infant survival, at some stage, the infant is required to maintain a normal body temperature without {{the assistance of a}} heated incubator. Successfully transitioning from an incubator to an unheated open cot by maintaining a normal body temperature and having continued weight gain are key criteria the infant must achieve in order to be discharged from hospital. The literature reports various practices for transferring infants from incubators to open cots, but does not specifically address how, or to what extent, practices vary. Additionally, an extensive literature search could not determine why a weight of 1800 g has traditionally been used as a criterion for transferring preterm infants to unheated open cots. Other limited data suggests that preterm infants could be transferred at body weights lower than 1800 g. Aims These studies aimed to systematically summarise the evidence for transferring preterm infants to open cots; to describe current practice in public hospital high dependency neonatal units within Australia and New Zealand; and to determine the effects on temperature stability and weight gain when transferring lower weight (1600 g) preterm infants (compared with higher weight, 1800 g) to unheated open cots. Research Design Quantitative research methods were used to meet the aims in three phases of research. Phase 1 involved conducting a Cochrane Systematic Review to collate findings from randomised and quasirandomised controlled trials on the transfer of preterm infants from incubators to unheated open cots at lower body weights compared to higher body weights. Phase 1 provided background information and data on practices and other proposed strategies for transfer to open cots, and assisted in developing a survey sent to neonatal units in Australia and New Zealand (Phase 2). Phase 3 used the information and data from Phase 1 to inform and design a multi-centred, randomised controlled trial. The results of Phase 3 were used to update and draw conclusions for the Cochrane Systematic Review (Phase 1). Results While many common practices for transferring premature infants to unheated open cots exist in Australian and New Zealand neonatal nurseries, these practices vary considerably. Only one variable, nursing infants clothed (p = 0. 011), showed significant practice variation between viii Australian and New Zealand public hospital high dependency neonatal units. Between neonatal intensive care and special care baby units, practice variations were significant for weight range (p = 0. 005), evidence-based practice (p = 0. 004), historical nursery practice (p = 0. 029) and incubator air control mode (p = 0. 001). Differences in these variables existed between nurseries in metropolitan and rural locations. Processes and practices undertaken similarly in both Australia and New Zealand included use of incubator air control mode, current weight criterion, thermal challenging, singlewalled incubators, and use of <b>heated</b> <b>mattress</b> systems. The randomised controlled trial demonstrated that medically stable, preterm infants can be transferred to unheated open cots at a weight of 1600 g without significant adverse effects on temperature stability or weight gain. Average daily weight gain in the 1600 g group was 17. 07 (SD 4. 5) g/kg/day compared to in the 1800 g group, 13. 97 (SD 4. 7) g/kg/day (p...|$|R

Methods: Stable preterm infants weighing 1300 to 1500 g were enrolled, being randomly allocated to either the study group (n = 41) receiving care in a cot on an HWM, or the control group (n = 33) receiving incubator care. The mean daily body temperature and episodes of cold stress and hyperthermia were recorded. Weight gain (g kg(- 1) body weight d(- 1)) was also calculated. The mothers completed questionnaires on {{their perceptions of their}} infants, and their anxiety and stress levels before randomization, and 2 - 3 wk later during the trial. Results: The mean body temperature was similar for {{the first week of the}} trial (study group 36. 9 degreesC vs controls 36. 9 degreesC). There were no significant differences in the incidence of cold stress, while more hyperthermic episodes were seen in the study group (p = 0. 03). There were no significant differences in weight gain during the first (study group 21. 4 g vs controls 19. 6 g) or second weeks of the trial (study group 20. 5 g vs controls 19. 2 g).

30|$|Fires {{in which}} a soft {{furnishing}} product is the first item ignited accounts for 5 % of all U.S. residential fires annually, but are responsible for a disproportionately high fraction of fire losses ([Hall 2008]; Hall & Harwood [1989]; [Greene & Miller 2006]; [Ahrens 2008]; [Horrocks 2001]; [Bwalya et al. 2009]). The goal {{of a number of}} current and proposed flammability regulations is to reduce these fire losses. Existing flammability regulations for soft furnishings mainly address upholstered chairs and mattresses. The approaches manufacturers have taken to comply with these regulations are fairly consistent. To comply with the California Bureau of Home Furnishings and Thermal Insulation (BHFTI) soft furnishings flammability regulations (e.g., Cal TB 129 ([Technical Bulletin 129 1992]) and Cal TB 603 ([California TB 603 et al. 1633]) for mattresses and Cal TB 133 (Technical Bulletin 133 [1991]) for upholstered chairs), manufacturers use a combination of flame retardant (FR) foam, FR cover fabrics, and/or barrier fabrics. In the UK however, the requirements of furniture flammability regulation for domestic furnishings (Consumer Protection Act [1987]) were mainly addressed by using flame retardant back-coated cover fabric in combination with filling materials, including PUF, which are required to pass stringent ignition criteria ([Chivas et al. 2009]). Currently, there is no federal flammability regulation for residential upholstered furniture in the U.S., but Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) has now proposed a regulation (CPSC 16 CFR Part 1634 ([16 CFR Part 1634])) that defines a smoldering and open flame metric for these products. To comply with the 1, 634 open flame ignition test, it is anticipated that barrier materials will be employed in residential upholstered furniture. To comply with the recent CPSC’s mattress flammability (open-flame) regulation 16 CFR Part 1633 (16 CFR [1633]), the manufacturers are solely relying on barrier materials. In addition, restrictions on flame retardants are increasing due to sustainability regulations ([Chivas et al. 2009]; [European et al. 1907]). Thus, fire barrier materials are expected to play an increasingly important role in reducing the fire hazard of soft furnishings. Other regulatory approaches include reducing risk of ignition through reduced ignition propensity cigarettes, reducing fire spread through residential sprinklers, and reducing the inherent fire hazard of fuel sources through lower <b>heat</b> release (HR) <b>mattresses.</b>|$|R
