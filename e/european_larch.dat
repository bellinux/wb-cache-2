60|$|The {{early seventies}} were years of swift {{change on the}} Middle Border. Day by day the {{settlement}} thickened. Section by section the prairie was blackened by the plow. Month by month the sweet wild meadows were fenced and pastured and so at last the colts and cows all came into captivity, and our horseback riding ceased, cut short as if by some imperial decree. Lanes of barbed wire replaced the winding wagon trails, our saddles gathered dust in the grain-sheds, and groves of Lombardy poplar and <b>European</b> <b>larch</b> replaced the tow-heads of aspen and hazel through which we had pursued the wolf and fox.|$|E
6000|$|We descended {{at first}} through {{rhododendron}} and juniper, then through black silver-fir (Abies Webbiana), and below that, near the river, {{we came to}} the Himalayan larch; a tree quite unknown, except from a notice in the journals of Mr. Griffith, who found it in Bhotan. It is a small tree, twenty to forty feet high, perfectly similar in general characters to a <b>European</b> <b>larch,</b> but with larger cones, which are erect upon the very long, pensile, whip-like branches; its leaves,--now red--were falling, and covering the rocky ground on which it grew, scattered amongst other trees. It is called [...] "Saar" [...] by the Lepchas and Cis-himalayan Tibetans, and [...] "Boarga-sella" [...] by the Nepalese, who say it is found as far west as the heads of the Cosi river: it does not inhabit Central or West Nepal, nor the North-west Himalaya. The distribution of the Himalayan pines is very remarkable. The Deodar has not been seen east of Nepal, nor the Pinus Gerardiana, Cupressus torulosa, or Juniperus communis. On the other hand, Podocarpus is confined to the east of Katmandoo. Abies Brunoniana does not occur west of the Gogra, nor the larch west of the Cosi, nor funereal cypress (an introduced plant, however) west of the Teesta (in Sikkim). Of the twelve* [Juniper, 3; yew, Abies Webbiana, Brunoniana, and Smithiana: Larch, Pinus excelsa, and longifolia, and Podocarpus neriifolia.] Sikkim and Bhotan Coniferae (including yew, junipers, and Podocarpus) eight are common to the North-west Himalaya (west of Nepal), and four* [Larch, Cupressus funebris, Podocarpus neriifolia, Abies Brunoniana.] are not: of the thirteen natives of the north-west provinces, again, only five* [A juniper (the European communis), Deodar (possibly only a variety of the Cedar of Lebanon and of Mount Atlas), Pinus Gerardiana, P. excelsa, and Crupressus torulosa.] are not found in Sikkim, and I have given their names below, because they show how European the absent ones are, either specifically or in affinity. I have stated that the Deodar is possibly a variety of the Cedar of Lebanon. This is now a prevalent opinion, which is strengthened by {{the fact that so many}} more Himalayan plants are now ascertained to be European than had been supposed before they were compared with European specimens; such are the yew, Juniperus communis, Berberis vulgaris, Quercus Ballota, Populus alba and Euphratica, etc. The cones of the Deodar are identical with those of the Cedar of Lebanon: the Deodar has, generally longer and more pale bluish leaves and weeping branches,* [Since writing the above, I have seen, in the magnificent Pinetum at Dropmore, noble cedars, with the length and hue of leaf, and the pensile branches of the Deodar, and far more beautiful than that is, and as unlike the common Lebanon Cedar as possible. When it is considered from how very few wild trees (and these said to be exactly alike) the many dissimilar varieties of the C. Libani have been derived; the probability of this, the Cedar of Algiers, and of the Himalayas (Deodar) being all forms of one species, is greatly increased. We cannot presume to judge from the few cedars which still remain, what the habit and appearance of the tree may have been, when it covered the slopes of Libanus, and seeing how very variable Coniferae are in habit, we may assume that its surviving specimens give us no information on this head. Should all three prove one, it will materially enlarge our ideas of the distribution and variation of species. The botanist will insist that the typical form of cedar is that which retains its characters best over the greatest area, namely, the Deodar; in which case the prejudice of the ignorant, and the preconceived ideas of the naturalist, must yield to the fact that the old familiar Cedar of Lebanon is an unusual variety of the Himalayan Deodar.] but these characters seem to be unusually developed in our gardens; for several gentlemen, well acquainted with the Deodar at Simla, when asked to point it out in the Kew Gardens, have indicated the Cedar of Lebanon, and when shown the Deodar, declare that they never saw that plant in the Himalaya! ...|$|E

40|$|Summary &mdash; Interspecific {{hybridization}} {{between the}} tamarack and the Japanese and <b>European</b> <b>larches</b> was attempted. Successful crosses between the tamarack and the Japanese larch {{as well as}} the 3 -way hybrid (tamarack crossed to <b>European</b> x Japanese <b>larches)</b> were obtained {{for the first time in}} France but on a limited scale. Hybridization with tamarack seems possible but rather difficult due to differences in phenology and reproduction potential. Hybrid clones were successfully propa-gated by stem cuttings with high rates of rooting and a good quality of the root system, especially for the tamarack and its hybrids. Field performances at 8 years reveal that even if their initial growth is vigorous is absolute terms, neither the tamarack nor its hybrids could compete with the hybrid Larix decidua x L kaempferi for both growth and stem form. One exception is the 3 -way hybrid L laricina x (L decidua x L kaempferi) which can be advantageously compared to the latter. An additional advan-tage could be its expected greater tolerance of wet soils. Nevertheless, its creation appeared to be difficult. So far, the hybrid L decidua x L kaempferi seems to be best for reforestation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It is {{commonly}} known that Japanese larch, Larix kaempferi {{was first introduced}} in Europe in Great Britain in 1861. In the presence of <b>European</b> <b>larches,</b> L. decidua {{it was not long}} before the first hybrids between these species, called Dunkeld larches (Larix × marschlinsii), emerged there. It was found that there were sev-eral hybrid larch trees in Estonia that sprouted before one of their parent species was introduced in Europe. One of the oldest Dunkeld larches growing in Tallinn is about 210 years old. The radial growth of three Dun-keld larches in Estonia (in the cities of Pärnu and Tallinn and in the manor park of Suure-Kambja) and the de-termination of their age by cumulative growth graphs are discussed, with consideration given to the available knowledge on the introduction of Japanese larch. The conclusion is that there may have existed earlier alter-native introduction routes of Japanese larch into northern Europe via Russia.

50|$|Two {{areas of}} {{woodland}} went through major thinning. Sunside Wood (2 ha) {{consisted of a}} semi-natural mixed wood of mainly ash and yew with a few scattered old oaks and small leaved lime with low stunted crowns, all growing on limestone pavement with a shaded understorey of moss, ivy and ferns. Beech, Scots pine and larch had been planted in about 1850 on the western edge. The second area, Parkland Belts (0.6 ha) consisted of similar 1850 planting of beech with a few oak, Scots pine and larch, {{all of which were}} tall closely spaced, in poor condition with spindly crowns and many were beginning to die and several had been blown over. The woodland was also open to grazing as part of the parkland area and had been used for winter feeding and dumping rubbish. The intention was to thin these woods but it was found that they had deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} a partial clear fell was needed to avoid further wind blow. As a result, 163 trees were felled with a volume of 256 cubic metres, consisting of 108 beech, 7 oak, 18 sycamore, 8 ash, 5 wych elm, 1 horse chestnut, 9 <b>European</b> <b>larches,</b> 6 Scots pines and 1 Corsican pine.

40|$|International audienceSnow {{avalanches}} are a {{major threat}} {{in many parts of}} the Alps, where they periodically damage infrastructure, disrupt transportation corridors or even cause loss of life. Nonetheless, the spatial behavior of past avalanche activity and the analysis of areas affected during particular events remain often imprecise. It was therefore the purpose of this study to reconstruct spatio-temporal patterns of past avalanche activity on a forested avalanche talus in the French Alps (Pierres Jean-Jeanne talus, Massif de l'Oisans, France). A total of 232 <b>European</b> <b>larches</b> (Larix decidua Mill.) with clear signs of snow wasting events was analyzed and growth disturbances (GD) related to avalanche activity was assessed, such as tangential rows of traumatic resin ducts, the onset of compression wood or abrupt growth suppression and release. In total, 901 GD were identified in the tree-ring samples, indicating that 20 high-magnitude avalanches occurred between AD 1919 and 1994. The mean return period of snow avalanches was ~ 4 years with a ~ 26 % probability that an avalanche occurs in any particular year. Interpolated maps allowed for explicit spatial estimates of return periods throughout the talus, showing a rapid increase of return frequency from 2. 5 to 50 years with increasing distance from the talus apex. The distribution of avalanche years seems to be quite homogeneous in time with a gap between 1951 and 1959. Snowfall from a nearby meteorological station (Saint-Christophe en Oisans; 10 km from the study site) indicated that the five most recent high-magnitude events on record occurred due to above-average snowfall anomalies in December and January associated with abnormally low air temperatures. Findings suggest that a strong snow metamorphism under high temperature gradients in January could explain the occurrence of high-magnitude snow avalanches. 2010 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|Interestingly, {{it is only}} {{a century}} after the {{synthesis}} of the first pulvinone that the word Pulvinone turned into a collective term. In 1973, Edwards and Gill isolated the first naturally occurring hydroxylated pulvinone derivative.

To insist on their origin - and thereby differentiate them from the hydroxylated pulvinones found in Suillus grevillei - Seto and coworkers named these compounds Aspulvinones. The aspulvinone terminology also incorporates a letter, indicating the order of chromatographic elution of these compounds (hence, the least polar aspulvinone was named Aspulvinone A, the one eluting next Aspulvinone B, etc...).|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} the main growth modes of high-elevation conifers, such as typical variations inherent to annual tree growth records, we resolved eigen problems related to intra-record correlation coefficient matrices of several large sample sets for (A) very long-lived Chinese junipers and (B) shorter-lived <b>European</b> pines and <b>larches.</b> Such modes allow for the identification of tree growth variations of different origins, i. e., resulting from climate and/or microenvironments as well as origins that are purely biological in nature. We determined that these modes are universal, namely, that they are identical for both ring width (RW) and maximum latewood density (MXD) records. Certain specific shapes found in these main modes were indicative of anomalous tree growth. Cross-correlations between identical modes related to RW and MXD data were determined to be nonessential. This suggests that RW and MXD data likely represent different aspects of tree growth response to varying climatic and environmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|Open-pollinated {{hybridisation}} {{seed orchards}} of <b>European</b> and Japanese <b>larches</b> produce mixed progenies combining a highly variable proportion of hybrids along with pure parental species.

Taxa identification of 1 – 2 yr-old seedlings was attempted using non-destructive assessment of several traits, including morphology, phenology, growth and architecture parameters. Two sets of progenies originating from 10 open-pollinated hybridisation seed orchards were used, relying in a first step on taxa identification of individual seedlings with diagnostic molecular markers. Based on 21 traits assessed, some clear trends in pure species and hybrid features were apparent but due to the large and overlapping ranges of taxa characteristics, no single parameter allowed unambiguous identification of taxa. Combination of traits through linear discriminant analysis made possible correct classification of 90. 2 % to 98. 6 % of individuals depending on the orchard although {{there were a few}} problematic orchards. Two traits appeared particularly pertinent for discriminating young plants taxa, namely 1 st-yr leaf retention (marcescence) and the bark colour of 2 nd-year shoot increments.

40|$|Growth model forlarch in {{pure and}} even-aged stands.

This model has been built from 2578 <b>larches</b> (Japanese, <b>European</b> and Hybrid <b>larches)</b> in 99 stands. It enables to predict tree circumference increment from circumference, dominant height, basal area, age and site index of stands. Estimating increments of 1283 larches in 48 stands {{has been used to}} validate the model that gives unbiased estimates of the increments (mean error = - 0. 002 cm with standard deviation of 0. 60 cm).

The model has also been tested to predict the increment of larches in French experimental plots having very different silvicultural treatments. The residues of these estimations depend on the stand basal area: the lesser the stand basal area, the higher the residues of the estimation. A correction factor, linked to basal area through a Bailey and Clutter curve, has been introduced to extend the validity of the model to stands with a basal area lower than 12 m 2. ha - 1.
