40|$|<b>Implantation</b> <b>is</b> {{a pivotal}} {{step in the}} {{establishment}} of mammalian pregnancy. Although implantation strategies vary between species, many aspects of conceptus-maternal signalling necessary to induce uterine receptivity to <b>implantation</b> <b>are</b> conserved. The temporal 'window' for the initiation of <b>implantation</b> <b>is</b> short and precisely controlled by endocrine, paracrine and autocrine factors. An invariable prerequisite for the development of uterine receptivity to <b>implantation</b> <b>is</b> continuous exposure of the endometrium to progesterone which, after a species-specific interval, downregulates progesterone receptor (PGR) expression in the epithelium and stimulates the production of progestamedins. Uterine receptivity involves temporal changes in the expression of genes, leading to modifications in surface, extracellular matrix and secretory characteristics that support growth, proliferation, migration and attachment of the conceptus. Moreover, a complex interplay between endometrial progestamedins and estramedins and conceptus-derived oestrogens, cytokines and interferons (INFs), prostaglandins (PGs) and cortisol is crucial to the preparation for implantation.

Methods Since 1992, 18 patients (72 % male) with idiopathic VF out of 455 ICD implants were treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The mean age at first <b>ICD</b> <b>implantation</b> <b>was</b> 42 ± 14 years. Brugada syndrome, {{as well as other}} primary electrical diseases (e. g. long QT), were systematically excluded in all patients by the absence of the typical electrocardiogram (ST elevation in the right precordial leads) at rest and/or after pharmacological tests (ajmaline, flecainide, or procainamide). Recurrence of cardiac events was prospectively assessed. Results During a mean follow-up period of 41 ± 27 months, VF recurrence with appropriate shock occurred in 7 patients (39 %) covering a total of 27 shocks. The median time to first appropriate shock was 12 ± 9 months. There were no deaths. In the electrophysiological study, 39 % of patients were inducible, but inducibility failed to predict subsequent arrhythmic events. Forty-four percent of patients suffered 21 inappropriate shocks, which were caused by sinus tachycardia, atrial arrhythmias or lead malfunction.

We hypothesized that the presence of a fQRS might predict arrhythmic events in patients who received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), regardless of the indications for implantation. Methods and Results: A cohort of 107 consecutive patients (mean age, 53 years; 82 % male) who underwent an <b>ICD</b> <b>implantation</b> <b>was</b> studied. We defined fQRS, on a routine 12 -lead ECG, as the presence of an additional R wave or notching in the nadir of the S wave in 2 consecutive leads corresponding to a major coronary artery territory. In the presence of bundle branch block, more than 2 notches in the R or S waves in 2 consecutive leads were required to characterize fQRS. Patients were followed for 21. 3 ± 23 months for appropriate ICD therapy (antitachycardia pacing and/or shock). ICDs were implanted predominantly in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (N= 45, 42. 1 %), followed by Brugada syndrome (N= 26, 24. 3 %). fQRS presented in 42 patients (39. 3 %). During follow-up, patients with fQRS received more appropriate ICD therapy than those without fQRS (45. 2 % vs. 10. 8 %, P< 0. 0001).

MethodsQuestionnaire 1, completed one month after <b>ICD</b> <b>implantation,</b> <b>was</b> designed to assess: the quality of patient preparation for HM; patient comprehension of HM; and patient anxiety experienced during its installation. The comprehension questions were assigned a score of – 2 for an incorrect answer, + 1 for a correct answer and 0 for neither (total score ranging from – 40 to + 20). Questionnaire 2, completed six months after ICD implantation, assessed patient acceptance of and anxiety about HM. ResultsThe registry included 571 patients (mean age 63. 9 ± 12. 8  years; 83 % men; 76 % of ICDs implanted for primary prevention) followed by HM for 6. 2 ± 1. 2 months.

During a mean (SD) follow-up of 41 (33) months, 115 patients (53 %) experienced appropriate ICD therapy. Independent predictors of appropriate ICD therapy included advanced age, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 6 months prior to <b>ICD</b> <b>implantation)</b> <b>was</b> associated with higher probability of appropriate ICD therapy among patients with LVEF > 35 % (adjusted HR 2. 68 [95 % CI, 1. 05 - 6. 86; P = 0. 04]), but not among patients with LVEF < 35 % (adjusted HR 1. 09 [95 % CI, 0. 58 - 2. 04; P = 0. 79]). Left ventricular ejection fraction, advanced age, and renal impairment are long-term predictors of appropriate ICD therapy in patients with coronary disease at high risk of sudden cardiac death. Patients with an ejection fraction above 35 % have few arrhythmic events early after the myocardial infarction but appropriate therapies become more frequent late after the myocardial infarction, possibly due to progression of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} {{the results of a}} study of TiN thin films which are {{deposited}} by a Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) and Ion Beam Assisted Deposition (IBAD). In the present investigation the subsequent ion <b>implantation</b> <b>was</b> provided with N 2 + ions. The ion <b>implantation</b> <b>was</b> applied to enhance the mechanical properties of surface. The thin film deposition process exerts a number of effects such as crystallographic orientation, morphology, topography, densification of the films [...] A variety of analytic techniques were used for characterization, such as scratch test, calo test...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{immersion}} {{ion implantation}} from a BF 3 plasma into crystalline (100) silicon was performed using the PULSION plasma doping tool. Implanted boron profiles were measured with the SIMS method and simulated using models with {{different levels of}} sophistication. The physical <b>implantation</b> model <b>is</b> based on an analytical energy distribution for ions from the plasma and uses a Monte-Carlo simulation code. An analytical model of plasma immersion ion implantation that assumes a uniform and isotropic <b>implantation</b> <b>was</b> implemented in a software module called IMP 3 D. The functionality of this module which was initially envisaged for the three-dimensional simulation of conventional ion <b>implantation</b> <b>was</b> extended to plasma immersion ion implantation and examples of 2 D and 3 D simulations from this are presented...|$|R
40|$|Although {{zinc oxide}} is a {{promising}} {{material for the}} fabrication of short wavelength optoelectronic devices, p-type doping is a step that remains challenging for the realization of diodes. Out of equilibrium methods such as ion <b>implantation</b> <b>are</b> expected to dope ZnO successfully provided that the non-radiative defects introduced by <b>implantation</b> can <b>be</b> annealed out. In this study, ZnO substrates are implanted with nitrogen ions, and the extended defects induced by <b>implantation</b> <b>are</b> studied by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD), before and after annealing at 900 ^∘C. Before annealing, these defects are identified to be dislocation loops lying either in basal planes in high N concentration regions, or in prismatic planes in low N concentration regions, together with linear dislocations. An uniaxial deformation of 0. 4...|$|R
