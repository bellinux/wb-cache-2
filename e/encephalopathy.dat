5|$|In {{those with}} cirrhosis, {{the risk of}} {{developing}} hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> is 20% per year, and at any time about 30–45% of people with cirrhosis exhibit evidence of overt <b>encephalopathy.</b> The prevalence of minimal hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> detectable on formal neuropsychological testing is 60–80%; this increases the likelihood of developing overt <b>encephalopathy</b> in the future. Once hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> has developed, the prognosis is determined largely by other markers of liver failure, such as the levels of albumin (a protein produced by the liver), the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation, which relies on proteins produced in the liver), the presence of ascites and the level of bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin which is conjugated and excreted by the liver). Together with the severity of <b>encephalopathy,</b> these markers have been incorporated into the Child-Pugh score; this score determines the one- and two-year survival and may assist in a decision to offer liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|The term minimal <b>encephalopathy</b> (MHE) {{is defined}} as <b>encephalopathy</b> that {{does not lead to}} {{clinically}} overt cognitive dysfunction, but can be demonstrated with neuropsychological studies. This is still an important finding, as minimal <b>encephalopathy</b> has been demonstrated to impair quality of life and increase the risk of involvement in road traffic accidents.|$|E

5|$|Hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> {{may also}} occur after the {{creation}} of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). This is used in the treatment of refractory ascites, bleeding from oesophageal varices and hepatorenal syndrome. TIPS-related <b>encephalopathy</b> occurs in about 30% of cases, with the risk being higher in those with previous episodes of <b>encephalopathy,</b> higher age, female sex and liver disease due to causes other than alcohol.|$|E
5|$|In a small {{proportion}} of cases, the <b>encephalopathy</b> is caused directly by liver failure; this is more likely in acute liver failure. More commonly, especially in chronic liver disease, hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> is triggered by an additional cause, and identifying these triggers can be important to treat the episode effectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> {{can only be}} made in the presence of confirmed liver disease (types A and C) or a portosystemic shunt (type B), as its symptoms are similar to those encountered in other encephalopathies. To make the distinction, abnormal liver function tests and/or ultrasound suggesting liver disease are required, and ideally liver biopsy. The symptoms of hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> may also arise from other conditions, such as cerebral haemorrhage and seizures (both of which are more common in chronic liver disease). A CT scan of the brain may be required to exclude haemorrhage, and if seizure activity is suspected an electroencephalograph (EEG) study may be performed. Rarer mimics of <b>encephalopathy</b> are meningitis, encephalitis, Wernicke's <b>encephalopathy</b> and Wilson's disease; these may be suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed with investigations.|$|E

5|$|The {{treatment}} of hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> {{depends on the}} suspected underlying cause (types A, B or C) and {{the presence or absence}} of underlying causes. If <b>encephalopathy</b> develops in acute liver failure (type A), even in a mild form (grade 1–2), it indicates that a liver transplant may be required, and transfer to a specialist centre is advised. Hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> type B may arise in those who have undergone a TIPS procedure; in most cases this resolves spontaneously or with the medical treatments discussed below, but in a small proportion of about5%, occlusion of the shunt is required to address the symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Dietary supplementation with {{branched-chain}} {{amino acids}} has shown improvement of <b>encephalopathy</b> and other complications of cirrhosis. Some {{studies have shown}} benefit of administration of probiotics ("healthy bacteria").|$|E
5|$|<b>Encephalopathy</b> often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe <b>encephalopathy.</b> A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E

5|$|In acute liver failure, the {{development}} of severe <b>encephalopathy</b> strongly predicts short-term mortality, and is almost {{as important as the}} nature of the underlying cause of the liver failure in determining the prognosis. Historically, widely used criteria for offering liver transplantation, such as King's College Criteria, are of limited use and recent guidelines discourage excessive reliance on these criteria. The occurrence of hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> in people with Wilson's disease (hereditary copper accumulation) and mushroom poisoning indicates an urgent need for a liver transplant.|$|E
5|$|In hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> type C, the {{identification}} and treatment of alternative or underlying causes {{is central to the}} initial management. Given the frequency of infection as the underlying cause, antibiotics are often administered empirically (without knowledge of the exact source and nature of the infection).

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> is a clinical one, once other causes for confusion or coma have been excluded; no test fully diagnoses or excludes it. Serum ammonia levels are elevated in 90% of people, {{but not all}} hyperammonaemia (high ammonia levels) is associated with <b>encephalopathy.</b> A CT scan of the brain usually shows no abnormality except in stage IV <b>encephalopathy,</b> when cerebral oedema may be visible. Other neuroimaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are not currently regarded as useful, although they may show abnormalities. Electroencephalography shows no clear abnormalities in stage 0, even if minimal HE is present; in stages I, II and III there are triphasic waves over the frontal lobes that oscillate at 5Hz, and in stage IV there is slow delta wave activity. However, the changes in EEG are not typical enough to be useful in distinguishing hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> from other conditions.|$|E
5|$|The mildest form of hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> is {{difficult}} to detect clinically, but may be demonstrated on neuropsychological testing. It is experienced as forgetfulness, mild confusion, and irritability. The first stage of hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> is characterised by an inverted sleep-wake pattern (sleeping by day, being awake at night). The second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes. The third stage is marked by worsened confusion. The fourth stage {{is marked by a}} progression to coma.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> (HE) is {{an altered}} level of {{consciousness}} {{as a result}} of liver failure. Onset may be gradual or sudden. Other symptoms may include movement problems, changes in mood, or changes in personality. In the advanced stages it can result in a coma.|$|E

40|$|Pediatric epileptiform <b>encephalopathies</b> are a {{group of}} neurologically devastating {{disorders}} related to uncontrolled ictal and interictal epileptic activity, with a poor prognosis. Despite the number of pharmacological options for treatment of epilepsy, many of these patients are drug resistant. For these patients with uncontrolled epilepsy, motor and/or neuropsychological deterioration is common. To prevent these secondary consequences, surgery is often considered as either a curative or a palliative option. Magnetic resonance imaging to look for epileptic lesions that may be surgically treated {{is an essential part}} of the workup for these patients. Many surgical procedures for the treatment of epileptiform <b>encephalopathies</b> have been reported in the literature. In this paper the evidence for these procedures for the treatment of pediatric epileptiform <b>encephalopathies</b> is reviewed...|$|R

5|$|Hepatic <b>encephalopathy</b> is {{possibly}} reversible with treatment. This typically involves supportive care and addressing the triggers of the event. Lactulose is frequently used to decrease ammonia levels. Certain antibiotics and probiotics are other potential options. A liver transplant may improve outcomes {{in those with}} severe disease.|$|E
5|$|Lactulose and {{lactitol}} are disaccharides {{that are}} not absorbed from the digestive tract. They are thought to decrease the generation of ammonia by bacteria, render the ammonia inabsorbable by converting it to ammonium (NH4+) ions, and increase transit of bowel content through the gut. Doses of 15-30ml are administered three times a day; the result is aimed to be 3–5 soft stools a day, or (in some settings) a stool pH of <6.0. Lactulose may also be given by enema, especially if <b>encephalopathy</b> is severe. More commonly, phosphate enemas are used. This may relieve constipation, one {{of the causes of}} <b>encephalopathy,</b> and increase bowel transit.|$|E
5|$|Numerous other {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} described in hepatic <b>encephalopathy,</b> although their relative contribution to the disease state is uncertain. Loss of glutamate transporter gene expression (especially EAAT 2) {{has been attributed to}} acute liver failure. Benzodiazepine-like compounds have been detected at increased levels as well as abnormalities in the GABA neurotransmission system. An imbalance between aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine) and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) has been described; this would lead to the generation of false neurotransmitters (such octopamine and 2-hydroxyphenethylamine). Dysregulation of the serotonin system, too, has been reported. Depletion of zinc and accumulation of manganese may play a role. Inflammation elsewhere in the body may precipitate <b>encephalopathy</b> through the action of cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide on astrocytes.|$|E
