5|$|Lutetium has no {{biological}} role as well, but it {{is found}} even in the highest known organism, the humans, concentrating in bones, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the liver and kidneys. Lutetium salts are known to cause metabolism and they occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides. Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content, so it is not known how much the average human takes in, but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble ones are not. Lanthanum is not essential for humans and has a low to moderate level of toxicity. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the general similarity of the rare earths means that it may be substituted by some of the other early lanthanides with no ill effects.|$|E
25|$|Sherrington's Second Law: The law of {{reciprocal}} innervation. When contraction of a muscle is stimulated, {{there is a}} simultaneous inhibition of its antagonist. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> coordinated movement.|$|E
25|$|The laws of kashrut can {{be broken}} for pikuach nefesh, i.e. when human life or health is at stake. So, for example, it is allowed for a patient to eat non-kosher food if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> recovery, or when one would starve if not partaking of non-kosher food.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{strength}} and wealth of the United States, Bowles believed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> America to further develop vigorous, sizable foreign aid programs to {{a large number of}} countries.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the diverse}} and {{extensive}} operations on various continents, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> the Gorgasali University endowing its Institute UNIES with an autonomous structure for its main task of globally developing and extending {{the delivery of}} the University’s Higher Education.|$|R
50|$|Clarke {{contributed to}} the early {{application}} of GCA. GCA was developed during World War II to enable pilots returning to base to land safely when visibility <b>was</b> poor. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> maintaining the flow of supplies during the Berlin airlift in 1948-49.|$|R
25|$|The iron-dependent enzyme, {{ribonucleotide}} reductase (RNR), {{is essential}} for DNA synthesis. Class I RNR enzymes are constructed from large RNR1 and small RNR2 subunits which associate to form an active heterodimeric tetramer. Since the enzyme catalyses the de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), precursors to DNA synthesis, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> cell proliferation.|$|E
25|$|Cortisol (or hydrocortisone) is {{the most}} {{important}} human glucocorticoid. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> life, and it regulates or supports a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic, and homeostatic functions. Various synthetic glucocorticoids are available; these are widely utilized in general medical practice and numerous specialties either as replacement therapy in glucocorticoid deficiency or to suppress the immune system.|$|E
25|$|Creativity can be {{encouraged}} in people and professionals {{and in the}} workplace. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.|$|E
50|$|Whilst Gallagher welcomed {{funding for}} UDA-backed {{projects}} in 2007 {{he argued that}} the government had to accept that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> the government to accept that the UDA was central to loyalist communities and that they could not be taken out of the equation in determining how money was spent.|$|R
50|$|Cereal RAFTIN. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> {{specifically}} <b>for</b> the maturation {{phase of}} pollen development.|$|R

25|$|This {{regional}} climate {{supports a}} chaparral and woodlands ecoregion that is further divided in three sub-regions where two are observed in San Diego–Tijuana. These are the coastal sage and chaparral and montane chaparral and woodlands ecoregions. In the montane region, fire serves a unique purpose {{as a medium}} of change, and while fire typically can threaten urban development, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> the historically annual cleanse of the woodlands and reproduction of pyrophytes.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies of}} water for salmon habitat must be clean and oxygenated. One sign of high {{productivity}} and growth rate in the oceans {{is the level of}} algae. Increased algal levels lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the water, which transfers into living organisms, fostering underwater plants and small organisms, which salmon eat. Algae can filter high levels of toxins and pollutants. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> algae and other water-filtering agents to not be destroyed in the oceans because they contribute to the well-being of the food chain.|$|E
25|$|Hsp90 plays {{apparently}} conflicting {{roles in}} the cell, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> both the creation and the maintenance {{as well as the}} destruction of proteins. Its normal function is critical to maintaining the health of cells, whereas its dysregulation may contribute to carcinogenesis. The ability of this chaperone to both stabilize the 26S proteasome (which enables the cell to degrade unwanted and/or harmful proteins) and to stabilize kinases against the same proteasome demonstrates its functional diversity. The uses of Hsp90 inhibitors in cancer treatment highlight Hsp90's importance as a therapeutic target.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-2000s, {{disputes}} over history, territory and policies aimed at North Korea {{had brought the}} two countries' relations to a low point, and deepened their mistrust in each other. Professor Shin Jang-churl of Soongsil University in Seoul advised that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> consensus to <b>be</b> reached by both Japanese and South Korean nationals on the relevant issues that divided them.|$|R
25|$|During the Christian conquest, little {{emphasis}} {{was placed on}} resettling the region, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> the sovereigns of the time to consolidate more strategic zones (in the 11th century, priority was placed on the south of the Sistema Central, a mountain range located {{in the center of the}} Iberian peninsula), which is why Medina del Campo remained intact into the 12th century.|$|R
2500|$|Into the 1920s and 1930s, {{however, the}} party did begin {{to argue that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> workers to have {{sufficient}} [...] "elbow room" [...] in which to organise for socialist revolution – and so they favoured workers struggling for democracy and basic liberties. They did this, however, {{with the proviso that}} socialists should not align themselves with any pro-capitalist factions to that end.|$|R
25|$|Culture is {{definitely}} beyond ethnicity and race. Healthcare professionals {{need to learn}} about the tolerance of other's beliefs and remember that the professional care is about meeting patients' needs even if they do not align with our personal beliefs. Discovering our own beliefs and why we have them (from upbringing or modeling of parents, for example) helps understand what is believed and actions at time when others are cared firwith different beliefs. As a result, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> healthcare professionals to practice cultural competence and recognize the differences as well as cultural sensitivities to provide holistic care for the patients.|$|E
25|$|Diffusion is a {{fundamental}} physical phenomenon, which Einstein characterized as Brownian motion, that describes the random thermal movement of molecules and small particles in gases and liquids. It is an important phenomenon for small distances (<b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> the achievement of thermodynamic equilibria), but, as the time necessary to cover a distance by diffusion {{is proportional to the}} square of the distance itself, it is ineffective for spreading a solute over macroscopic distances. The diffusion coefficient, D, is typically quite small, and its effect can often be considered negligible (unless groundwater flow velocities are extremely low, as they are in clay aquitards).|$|E
25|$|Orthogonality is {{a system}} design {{property}} which guarantees that modifying the technical effect produced by a component of a system neither creates nor propagates side effects to other components of the system. Typically this is achieved through the separation of concerns and encapsulation, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> feasible and compact designs of complex systems. The emergent behavior of a system consisting of components should be controlled strictly by formal definitions of its logic and not by side effects resulting from poor integration, i.e., non-orthogonal design of modules and interfaces. Orthogonality reduces testing and development time because {{it is easier to}} verify designs that neither cause side effects nor depend on them.|$|E

5000|$|In 2000, Qin and Blankenstein, {{showed that}} IFNγ {{production}} {{was necessary for}} CD4+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. A series of experiments showed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> nonhematopoietic cells {{at the site of}} challenge, to express functional IFNγ receptors. Further experiments showed that IFN-γ was responsible for inhibition of tumor induced angiogenesis and could prevent tumor growth through this method. (Qin and Blankenstein, 2000) ...|$|R
25|$|English is {{the medium}} of {{instruction}} for later years in some primary schools, all secondary schools and in higher education. Politically, some Ethiopians regard English medium instruction, with English textbooks, as replacing Ethiopian culture with Western values and loss of identity. The failure of Ethiopia to modernize was because modernization was based on Western values rather than renewal within the Ethiopian tradition. Educational systems foster national unity by inculcating social, cultural and political ideas and these need to become Ethiopian by replacing English instruction with instruction in Ethiopian languages. Amharic or Afan Oromo are spoken by more than 60% of Ethiopians, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> these languages to be learnt by Ethiopians.|$|E
25|$|TFIIH {{enters the}} complex. TFIIH {{is a large}} protein complex that {{contains}} among others the CDK7/cyclin H kinase complex and a DNA helicase. TFIIH has three functions: It binds specifically to the template strand {{to ensure that the}} correct strand of DNA is transcribed and melts or unwinds the DNA (ATP-dependent) to separate the two strands using its helicase activity. It has a kinase activity that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II at the amino acid serine. This switches the RNA polymerase to start producing RNA. Finally <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) of damaged DNA. TFIIH and TFIIE strongly interact with one another. TFIIE affects TFIIH’s catalytic activity. Without TFIIE, TFIIH will not unwind the promoter.|$|E
25|$|The {{walls of}} the hollow cochlea are made of bone, with a thin, {{delicate}} lining of epithelial tissue. This coiled tube is divided through most of its length by an inner membranous partition. Two fluid-filled outer spaces (ducts or scalae) are formed by this dividing membrane. At {{the top of the}} snailshell-like coiling tubes, there is a reversal of the direction of the fluid, thus changing the vestibular duct to the tympanic duct. This area is called the helicotrema. This continuation at the helicotrema allows fluid being pushed into the vestibular duct by the oval window to move back out via movement in the tympanic duct and deflection of the round window; since the fluid is nearly incompressible and the bony walls are rigid, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> the conserved fluid volume to exit somewhere.|$|E
50|$|Some of the terrains have {{multiple}} deformations, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> {{them to have}} complex deformation.|$|R
5|$|The {{popularity}} of batik in Indonesia has varied. Historically, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> ceremonial costumes and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> worn {{as part of}} a kebaya dress, commonly worn every day. The use of batik was already recorded in the 12th century, and the textile has become a strong source of identity for Indonesians crossing religious, racial and cultural boundaries. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> also believed the motif made the batik famous.|$|R
50|$|Blue Mountain is a 1993 album by American {{alternative}} country/Southern {{rock group}} Blue Mountain. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> recorded in June 1993 and released on 4 Barrell Records, {{produced by the}} band. Writing for Allmusic, Rob Caldwell gave the album a star rating of three out of five. He said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> less consistent than Blue Mountain's later work, but that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> fans of the band.|$|R
25|$|Cultural festivities during Novruz have {{striking}} resemblance to those in other countries of the region, namely Iran. Preparations for Novruz start long before the holiday. Rooted in Zoarastrian beliefs, {{in preparation for the}} arrival of the New Year, people do house cleaning, plant trees, make new dresses, paint eggs, make national pastries such as shekerbura, pakhlava and a great variety of local cuisine. As is traditional in other countries that celebrate Novruz, wheat is fried with kishmish (raisins) and nuts (govurga). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> every house to have semeni - sprouts of wheat. As a tribute to fire-worshiping (an ancient Zoarastrian belief) every Tuesday during four weeks before the holiday kids jump over small bonfires and candles are lit, a tradition shared with Iran, where it is called Chahar-shanbeh sori. On the holiday eve the graves of relatives are visited and tended.|$|E
25|$|Secondary vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{is associated}} with chronic malabsorption of lipids, impaired bile production and release, and chronic exposure to oxidants, such as cigarette smoke, and chronic alcoholism. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin and depends on micellar solubilization for dispersion into the small intestine, which results in poor use of vitamin A from low-fat diets. Zinc deficiency can also impair absorption, transport, and metabolism of vitamin A because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> the synthesis of the vitamin A transport proteins and as the cofactor in conversion of retinol to retinal. In malnourished populations, common low intakes of vitamin A and zinc increase the severity of vitamin A deficiency and lead physiological {{signs and symptoms of}} deficiency. A study in Burkina Faso showed major reduction of malaria morbidity with combined vitamin A and zinc supplementation in young children.|$|E
25|$|The brain {{structure}} {{that is the}} center of most neurobiological events associated with fear is the amygdala, located behind the pituitary gland. The amygdala is part of a circuitry of fear learning. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> proper adaptation to stress and specific modulation of emotional learning memory. In the presence of a threatening stimulus, the amygdala generates the secretion of hormones that influence fear and aggression. Once response to the stimulus in the form of fear or aggression commences, the amygdala may elicit the release of hormones into the body to put the person into a state of alertness, in which they are ready to move, run, fight, etc. This defensive response is generally referred to in physiology as the fight-or-flight response regulated by the hypothalamus, part of the limbic system. Once the person is in safe mode, meaning that there are no longer any potential threats surrounding them, the amygdala will send this information to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) where it is stored for similar future situations, which is known as memory consolidation.|$|E

50|$|Thomas, who {{had been}} rebaptised {{following}} his break with Campbellites in 1847 urged Marsh to also be rebaptised, as had another associate of Thomas, Benjamin Wilson, in 1851. Thomas and Marsh now agreed in belief in a kingdom on earth and the restoration of Israel, but disagreed on whether this <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> baptism. Thomas considered that <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> and if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> baptism, therefore <b>it</b> <b>was</b> also <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> fellowship and communion. The tension over rebaptism continued from 1852 to 1860. Marsh and Nathaniel Field of Jeffersonville, Indiana in the Prophetical Expositor, and Thomas in the Herald of the Kingdom conducted an increasingly heated exchange of articles on whether {{the return of the}} Jews, and understanding of the promises to Abraham, was a prerequisite for a valid baptism, and therefore communion.|$|R
50|$|The {{battle for}} Purandar fort was a {{landmark}} battle of symbolic importance {{for both the}} Marathas and Mughals. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>for</b> the Marathas to hold off the Mughals {{for as long as}} possible, thus demonstrating the difficulty of conquering the mountainous Maratha Empire. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> equally imperative for the Mughals to conquer Purandhar as swiftly as possible to demonstrate the futility of resistance of the mighty Mughal empire.|$|R
