5|$|A <b>finite</b> {{field is}} a set of numbers with four {{generalized}} operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and have their usual properties, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity. An example of a <b>finite</b> field is the set of 13 numbers {0,1,2,…,12} using modular arithmetic. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12. For example, the result of 5×7=35mod13=9. Such <b>finite</b> fields can be defined for any prime p; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also be defined for any power m of a prime p'm. <b>Finite</b> fields are often called Galois fields, and are abbreviated as GF(p) or GF(p'm).|$|E
5|$|<b>Finite</b> {{fields are}} also used in coding theory and combinatorics.|$|E
5|$|If {{one point}} {{elasticity}} {{is used to}} model demand changes over a <b>finite</b> range of prices, elasticity is implicitly assumed constant with respect to price over the <b>finite</b> price range. The equation defining price elasticity for one product can be rewritten (omitting secondary variables) as a linear equation.|$|E
5|$|Middle Mongol had a {{slightly}} larger set of declarative <b>finite</b> verb suffix forms {{and a smaller}} number of participles, which {{were less likely to be}} used as <b>finite</b> predicates. The linking converb -n became confined to stable verb combinations, while the number of converbs increased. The distinction between male, female and plural subjects exhibited by some <b>finite</b> verbal suffixes was lost.|$|E
5|$|More {{sophisticated}} counting techniques, {{for example}} counting cosets, yield more precise statements about <b>finite</b> groups: Lagrange's Theorem states {{that for a}} <b>finite</b> group G the order of any <b>finite</b> subgroup H divides the order of G. The Sylow theorems give a partial converse.|$|E
5|$|The {{discrete}} {{equivalent of}} differentiation is <b>finite</b> differences. The study of differential calculus is unified with the calculus of <b>finite</b> differences in time scale calculus.|$|E
25|$|A field {{extension}} {{is called}} a cyclic extension if its Galois group is a cyclic group. The Galois group of every <b>finite</b> extension of a <b>finite</b> field is <b>finite</b> and cyclic, with an iterate of the Frobenius endomorphism as its generator. Conversely, given a <b>finite</b> field F and a <b>finite</b> cyclic group G, there is a <b>finite</b> field extension of F whose Galois group is G.|$|E

25|$|The {{sequence}} {Τn} {{may produce}} {{an infinite number}} of zero denominators B'i while also producing a subsequence of <b>finite</b> convergents. These <b>finite</b> convergents may not repeat themselves or fall into a recognizable oscillating pattern. Or they may converge to a <b>finite</b> limit, or even oscillate among multiple <b>finite</b> limits. No matter how the <b>finite</b> convergents behave, the continued fraction defined by the sequence {Τn} diverges by oscillation with the point at infinity in this case. are never zero.|$|E
25|$|There exist {{numerous}} topologies on {{any given}} <b>finite</b> set. Such spaces are called <b>finite</b> topological spaces. <b>Finite</b> spaces are sometimes used to provide examples or counterexamples to conjectures about topological spaces in general.|$|E
25|$|If {{the graph}} A is <b>finite</b> and all vertex groups Av are <b>finite</b> then the group G is {{virtually}} free, that is, G contains a free subgroup of <b>finite</b> index.|$|E

25|$|The finitary {{version of}} Szemerédi's theorem can be {{generalized}} to <b>finite</b> additive groups including vector spaces over <b>finite</b> fields. The <b>finite</b> field analog {{can be used as}} a model for understanding the theorem in the natural numbers.|$|E
25|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, mathematicians {{investigated}} {{some aspects of}} the theory of <b>finite</b> groups in great depth, especially the local theory of <b>finite</b> groups and the theory of solvable and nilpotent groups. As a consequence, the complete classification of <b>finite</b> simple groups was achieved, meaning that all those simple groups from which all <b>finite</b> groups can be built are now known.|$|E
25|$|Each {{function}} with a <b>finite</b> domain; e.g., any <b>finite</b> sequence of natural numbers.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{specifically}} {{in the field of}} <b>finite</b> group theory, the Sylow theorems are a collection of theorems named after the Norwegian mathematician Ludwig Sylow (1872) that give detailed information about the number of subgroups of fixed order that a given <b>finite</b> group contains. The Sylow theorems form a fundamental part of <b>finite</b> group theory and have very important applications in the classification of <b>finite</b> simple groups.|$|E
25|$|A {{factor is}} called <b>finite</b> if the {{projection}} 1 is <b>finite</b> and properly infinite otherwise. Factors of types I and II may be either <b>finite</b> or properly infinite, but factors of type III are always properly infinite.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequence}} {Τn} {{may produce}} {{no more than}} a <b>finite</b> number of zero denominators B'i. while the subsequence of <b>finite</b> convergents dances wildly around the plane in a pattern that never repeats itself and never approaches any <b>finite</b> limit, either.|$|E
25|$|The set {{of objects}} studied in {{discrete}} mathematics can be <b>finite</b> or infinite. The term <b>finite</b> mathematics is sometimes applied {{to parts of}} the field of discrete mathematics that deals with <b>finite</b> sets, particularly those areas relevant to business.|$|E

25|$|Because Cantor {{space is}} homeomorphic to any <b>finite</b> Cartesian power of itself, and Baire space is homeomorphic to any <b>finite</b> Cartesian power of itself, the {{analytical}} hierarchy applies equally well to <b>finite</b> Cartesian power {{of one of}} these spaces.|$|E
25|$|Natural numbers can be {{considered}} either as <b>finite</b> ordinals or <b>finite</b> cardinals. Here consider them as <b>finite</b> cardinal numbers. This is the first place where a major difference between the implementations in ZFC and NFU becomes evident.|$|E
25|$|Mathematicians often {{strive for}} a {{classification}} (or list) of all mathematical objects {{of a given}} type. It is generally believed that <b>finite</b> groups are too diverse to admit a useful classification. A more modest but still challenging problem is to classify all <b>finite</b> simple groups. These are <b>finite</b> groups which {{may be used as}} building blocks for constructing arbitrary <b>finite</b> groups {{in the same way that}} prime numbers can be used to construct arbitrary whole numbers by taking products. One of the major achievements of contemporary group theory is the classification of <b>finite</b> simple groups, a mathematical theorem which provides a list of all possible <b>finite</b> simple groups.|$|E

25|$|The {{equations}} used {{to model}} the option are often expressed as partial differential equations (see for example Black–Scholes equation). Once expressed in this form, a <b>finite</b> difference model can be derived, and the valuation obtained. A number of implementations of <b>finite</b> difference methods exist for option valuation, including: explicit <b>finite</b> difference, implicit <b>finite</b> difference and the Crank-Nicholson method. A trinomial tree option pricing model can {{be shown to be}} a simplified application of the explicit <b>finite</b> difference method. Although the <b>finite</b> difference approach is mathematically sophisticated, it is particularly useful where changes are assumed over time in model inputs– for example dividend yield, risk free rate, or volatility, or some combination of these– that are not tractable in closed form.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of <b>finite</b> abelian groups {{states that}} every <b>finite</b> abelian group G {{can be expressed}} as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of prime-power order; it {{is also known as}} the basis theorem for <b>finite</b> abelian groups. This is generalized by the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, with <b>finite</b> groups being the special case when G has zero rank; this in turn admits numerous further generalizations.|$|E

25|$|Over {{arbitrary}} fields, another {{class of}} <b>finite</b> {{groups that have}} a good representation theory are the <b>finite</b> groups of Lie type. Important examples are linear algebraic groups over <b>finite</b> fields. The representation theory of linear algebraic groups and Lie groups extends these examples to infinite-dimensional groups, the latter being intimately related to Lie algebra representations. The importance of character theory for <b>finite</b> groups has an analogue {{in the theory of}} weights for representations of Lie groups and Lie algebras.|$|E

A trie {{can be seen as a}} tree-shaped deterministic <b>finite</b> automaton. Each <b>finite</b> language is generated by a trie automaton, and each trie can be compressed into a deterministic acyclic <b>finite</b> state automaton.|$|E
