5|$|In a four-part series {{published}} between April and August 1995, Brock {{returns to}} New York City in prusuit of supervillain Carnage after learning about Carnage Unleashed, {{a video game}} based on Carnage's rampage in Maximum Carnage (1993). Carnage discovers a method of transporting his symbiote through phone lines, which he uses to hack computers and attack people playing the game. He escapes from the Ravencroft asylum and kidnaps his caregiver, Dr. Pazzo. Venom confronts Carnage <b>in</b> <b>cyberspace,</b> before Pazzo douses Carnage in flammable liquid and sets him ablaze. Venom saves Carnage from dying, reasoning that death is what he wants. A subplot has Brock meeting Kirstin, a young musician. When Brock accidentally paralyzes her boyfriend Clive, Kirstin asks her mother to avenge him; this storyline continues in Venom: Sinner Takes All.|$|E

How navigation can be facilitated {{is not well}} understood, particularly with complex systems involving spatial or geo-referenced information such as in cybercartographic products. There is extensive research on the way people navigate and orient themselves successfully in real and virtual environments, which could provide insight regarding ways to aid navigation and orientation <b>in</b> information <b>cyberspace.</b> This chapter discusses {{the similarities and differences}} of navigation and orientation between real/virtual spaces and <b>cyberspace</b> <b>in</b> terms of: (1) acquisition and representation of space; (2) tasks; and (3) navigation aids. The degree of generalization between these two spaces is discussed and serves as a basis for a conceptual framework, as well as guidelines, to support navigation <b>in</b> information <b>cyberspaces...</b>|$|R

5|$|Soon after, Rebecca {{contacts}} the hacker, {{and says}} that she has convinced TriOptimum to authorize the station's destruction; she provides him with details {{on how to do}} this. After obtaining the necessary codes, the hacker initiates the station's self-destruct sequence and flees to the escape pod bay. There, the hacker defeats Diego a second time, then attempts to disembark. However, SHODAN prevents the pod from launching; it seeks to keep the player aboard the station, while the bridge—which contains SHODAN—is jettisoned to a safe distance. Rebecca tells the hacker that he can still escape if he reaches the bridge; SHODAN then intercepts and jams the transmission. After defeating Diego for the third time and killing him for good, the hacker makes it to the bridge as it is released from the main station, which soon detonates. He is then contacted by a technician who managed to circumvent SHODAN's jamming signal. The technician informs him that SHODAN can only be defeated <b>in</b> <b>cyberspace,</b> due to the powerful shields that protect its mainframe computers. Using a terminal near the mainframe, the hacker enters cyberspace and destroys SHODAN. After his rescue, the hacker is offered a job at TriOptimum, but he declines in favor of continuing his life as a hacker.|$|E

The other principal difference is that both players place three stones before the game begins, and may also place a special “hidden stone”, which affects the board as a regular stone but is invisible to the opponent.

500|$|The player {{advances}} {{the plot}} by acquiring log discs and e-mails: the game contains no non-player characters {{with which to}} converse. Throughout the game, an evil artificial intelligence called SHODAN hinders the player's progress with traps and blocked pathways. Specific computer terminals allow the player to temporarily enter Cyberspace; inside, the player moves weightlessly through a wire frame 3D environment, while collecting data and fighting SHODAN's security programs. Actions <b>in</b> <b>Cyberspace</b> sometimes cause events in the game's physical world; for example, certain locked doors may only be opened <b>in</b> <b>Cyberspace.</b> Outside of Cyberspace, the player uses the game's sixteen weapons, of which a maximum of seven may be carried at one time, to combat robots, cyborgs and mutants controlled by SHODAN. Projectile weapons often have selectable ammunition types with varying effects; for example, the [...] "dart pistol" [...] may fire either explosive needles or tranquilizers.
