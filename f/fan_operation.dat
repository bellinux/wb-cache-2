50|$|An {{engineering}} {{option was}} designed to {{reduce the power loss}} due to engine radiator <b>fan</b> <b>operation</b> and to increase the heat available for heating of the passengers. After experiments by Wing-Commander T.R. Cave-Browne-Cave (CBC), Professor of Engineering at Southampton University, a satisfactory design was produced. The 'CBC' system involved two small engine radiators being placed above the driver's cab roof level at the front outer corners of the double deck to give maximum aerodynamic air flow. The engine coolant water was pumped around these instead of the traditional radiator. In cold weather, all or a portion of the air passing through these radiators, was diverted by flaps, the left into the upper saloon and the right to the lower deck. In hot weather, the flaps could be changed by push-pull levers in the driver's cab roof to divert all the hot air to the outside of the vehicle. The movement of the vehicle was (usually) adequate to cool the engine without the need for a fan or radiator at the traditional position in front of the engine. The traditional 'radiator' grille {{at the front of the}} vehicle was not required, but was usually retained (with a few exceptions) and blanked off behind. 'Varivane' wax capsule operated shutters were fitted in front of the upper radiators to keep the coolant at optimum temperature. There were some disadvantages to the scheme and eventually customers stopped specifying it.|$|E

40|$|The {{electric}} energy use in Swedish non-industrial buildings is 71 TWh per {{year out of}} which 30 TWh per year {{is used for the}} operation of technical systems. A significant part of those 30 TWh/year is used for pump and <b>fan</b> <b>operation.</b> The Swedish parliament decided in 2009 on a national energy and climate plan. By the year 2050 the energy use per unit conditioned floor area in the Swedish building stock must be halved compared to the year of 1995. The objective of this thesis is to find means to reduce pump and fan energy in the non-industrial buildings. The aim is to find systems and components that can provide energy reduction in pump and fan systems by 50 %. In the thesis the current situation in non-industrial buildings regarding pump and fan systems has been described and the energy saving potentials, both at component and at system level, have been identified and discussed. Furthermore, the possibility of decentralized pump and fan systems has been examined. The calculated saving potential is 50 % and 40 % respectively for pump and <b>fan</b> <b>operation</b> in non-industrial buildings. This may be achieved by improving pump efficiency and specific fan power to state-of-the-art efficiency and recommended SFP values.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} a new industrial case on automation, for large scale systems with high environmental impact: the mining ventilation control systems. Ventilation control {{is essential for}} the operation of a mine in terms of safety (CO and NO_x regulation) and energy optimization. We first discuss a novel regulation architecture, highlighting the interest for a model-based control approach and the use of distributed sensing capabilities thanks to a wireless sensor network (WSN). We propose a new model for underground ventilation. The main components of the system dynamics are described with time-delays, transmission errors, energy losses and concentration profiles. Two different model-based control approaches, which can embody the complex dynamics of the system, are proposed. The first one resorts to a nonlinear model predictive control strategy (receding horizon) and aims to energy minimization thanks to a continuous <b>operation</b> of the <b>fans.</b> The second one, based on a hybrid description of the model and <b>fans</b> <b>operation,</b> provides automatic verification of the wireless control thanks to abstraction techniques. These control strategies are compared with simulations, in terms of regulation efficiency, energy consumption and need for computational capabilities.

40|$|When {{measuring}} {{emissions of}} gases, particulate, and odor from animal buildings, the ventilation data are equally {{important as the}} concentration data, because emission rate of a pollutant {{is the product of}} its concentration and the ventilation rate. However, effectively measuring and monitoring building ventilation remains a technical challenge, especially in barns with numerous fans. Although several measurement and monitoring techniques have been used in livestock barn studies, they are either relatively expensive or unreliable. A new technique was introduced for continuously monitoring exhaust <b>fan</b> <b>operation</b> in real-time by detecting the vibration of its housing or frame member. A low-cost vibration sensor, a 2 -coductor cable, a signal filter, and a digital input channel are used for each fan. A laboratory test was conducted to evaluate the technical viability of using the sensor in continuous vibration conditions. A 4 -month field test in layer barns was conducted to test the accuracy and life of three vibration sensors, which were installed on the fan housings and cones. The <b>fan</b> <b>operation</b> data was logged by a computer every minute. Coupled with simultaneous building static pressure measurement, the continuous ventilation rate can be calculated by using the fan airflow vs. pressure performance curve. The advantages of this technique include low cost (only about 1 % to 10 % of the cost of other tested techniques), simplicity, no interference by wind and dust, and the capability of directly monitoring individual fans to avoid false signals caused by fan failure, fan management changes or other problems. This paper describes the technique and presents the test results...|$|E
40|$|Predictive {{maintenance}} of rectifier transformers in the aluminum smelting industry {{has become a}} major area of interest in planning for a replacement or refurbishment of these assets before a failure event occurs. The end of life of a transformer is linked to the rate of degradation of the winding paper insulation which is mainly due to heating processes. Rectifier transformers are subject to high thermal stress due to harmonic currents flowing through them. The need of monitoring and regulation of the hotspot temperature on the rectifier transformer winding is of great importance to keep the temperatures within safe limits as to preserve its life span. In this thesis, existing thermal models; the IEC model, the improved IEEE model, the G. Swift model and the D. Susa model used for hotspot temperature estimation in regulating power transformers has been adapted to account for increased heating due to harmonic currents flowing in the rectifier transformers. Extrapolation techniques, nonlinear least square optimization and genetic algorithm optimization are used for obtaining the rectifier transformer thermal model parameters using online measurements. The thermal model parameters are obtained in two different cooling <b>fan</b> <b>operation</b> conditions; OFAF mode 1 (one <b>fan</b> <b>operation)</b> and OFAF mode 2 (three fans operation) as the transformers under case study are utilized in these cooling modes. A predictive maintenance technique is implemented using typical loading profiles of the transformers and forecasted ambient temperatures to estimate and regulate future hotspot temperatures within safe temperature limits as derived using an industry accepted end of life equation...|$|E
40|$|Emissions of gaseous {{compounds}} and particulate matter {{are the product}} of the pollutant concentrations and air exhausted from the fans of mechanically ventilated animal confinement buildings. Direct methods of monitoring exhaust <b>fan</b> <b>operation</b> (i. e., mercury tilt, limit or whisker, and vibration switches) have been reported to have limitations due to mechanical failure and/or the effect of the environment (dust, wind, moisture). Another method involves monitoring the control relay status at the fan system control box. A problem could occur at the fan but not in the signal at the control box, thereby giving a false operational signal. The objective of this project was to find a more reliable method of monitoring <b>fan</b> <b>operation</b> status. This paper describes the development, lab testing, and use of a fan monitoring system based on induction operated current switches (ICS). ICSs are unaffected by the environment and can provide direct measurement of real-time fan operational status by sensing AC current. A laboratory test of the ICS was performed to simulate a fan off/on duty cycle in a two-year emissions study; no ICS failure was recorded. The Southeastern Broiler Gaseous and Particulate Matter Emission study led by Iowa State University has been using 28 ICSs for over 190 days without a failure. At a unit cost as low as $ 19. 50 this method offers a reliable, accurate, and economical way of measuring the real-time operational status of ventilation fans – a critical component of any air emissions monitoring in a mechanically ventilated confinement system...|$|E

Though the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) has been pushing regulation that requires all new generation created to incorporate cooling towers, existing plants can still use the bodies of water they are built on at this point. Lakes are typically less efficient than cooling towers in that they cannot usually get the temperatures as cooling towers could get, so the condensers on lakes and rivers are usually designed with a high design inlet temperature. However, there typically would be energy saving by using a lake for no need for cooling tower <b>fans</b> <b>operation.</b> In this paper, through a case study, a thermal balance analysis was conducted to investigate the heat dissipation rate {{of the lake and}} thus to determine the outlet temperature of the water from the lake to feed into the generator's condenser, which is a critical factor to influence the generator's efficiency. In addition, the analysis is to identify the most dominant variables for enhancing the lake dissipation rate and hence provide cost-effective measures to enhance the power plant efficiency.
