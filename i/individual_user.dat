25|$|A common {{issue in}} {{previous}} Windows versions was that competing applications doing common tasks each tried to associate {{themselves as the}} default for a certain file type using their own custom user interface. The default application information for a particular file type was stored in the registry on a per-machine basis, resulting in applications changing another user's default program when one user's defaults were changed and each application querying several different registry values when launched. In Windows Vista onwards, file type associations and protocol handlers can be set on a per-user basis using the new Default Programs API, meaning default programs for file types and tasks can be different for each <b>individual</b> <b>user.</b> There is an API for calling a common user interface so applications {{no longer need to}} maintain their own file association UI. The Default Programs API gives applications a programmatic way to check for and discover other default applications, restore a single or all registered defaults, query for the owner of a specific default file association/protocol, launch the Default Programs UI for a specific application or clear all per user associations. Applications only need to registered at install time to be part of Default Programs.|$|E

500|$|Privacy {{advocates and}} other critics have {{expressed}} concern regarding Windows10's privacy policies and its collection and use of customer data. Under the default [...] "Express" [...] settings, Windows10 is configured to send various information to Microsoft and other parties, including the collection of user contacts, calendar data, and [...] "associated input data" [...] to personalize [...] "speech, typing, and inking input", typing and inking data to improve recognition, allowing apps to use a unique [...] "advertisingID" [...] for analytics and advertising personalization (functionality introduced by Windows 8.1) and allow apps to request the user's location data and send this data to Microsoft and [...] "trusted partners" [...] to improve location detection (Windows8 had similar settings, except that location data collection did not include [...] "trusted partners"). Users can opt out from most of this data collection, but telemetry data for error reporting and usage is also sent to Microsoft, and this cannot be disabled on non-Enterprise versions of Windows10. Microsoft's privacy policy states, however, that [...] "Basic"-level telemetry data is anonymized and cannot {{be used to identify}} an <b>individual</b> <b>user</b> or device.

In January 2015, Uber announced a program Kalanick called [...] "principled confrontation" [...] that included reaching compromises with local municipalities on new regulations. Since implementing this program, Uber has seen 17 cities pass new favourable ordinances. Uber had worked out an arrangement with the city of Boston to share quarterly data on the duration, locations, and times of day in which riders used the app to travel in or out of the city. This information was first delivered to the city in February 2015, and the report kept all <b>individual</b> <b>user</b> data private.

In addition to user-generated promotion, these sites also offer advertisements within <b>individual</b> <b>user</b> communities and categories.
