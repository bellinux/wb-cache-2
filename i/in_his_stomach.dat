5|$|Bond {{travels to}} Kazan, Russia, where he finds Vesper Lynd's former lover, Yusef Kabira (Simon Kassianides), {{a member of}} Quantum who seduces women with {{valuable}} connections, and who is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau (Stana Katic), a Canadian Intelligence agent, of his true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate. He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene {{was found dead in}} the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b> M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Walking away, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.|$|E

After firing on the creature which escapes unharmed, Mulder finds Scully hiding upstairs. They search for the creature, and as it lunges to attack them, Tskany shoots it. Scully expresses disbelief on seeing Parker’s body, saying that Parker was in the bathroom, sick, {{and then they were}} attacked by the mountain lion. But Tskany says that the lion is still in its cage.|$|E
5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b> At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the last}} of Morganson's bacon. <b>In</b> all <b>his</b> life he had never pampered <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b> <b>In</b> fact, <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> had been a sort of {{negligible}} quantity that bothered him little, and about which he thought less. But now, in the long absence of wonted delights, the keen yearning of <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> was tickled hugely by the sharp, salty bacon.|$|R

5|$|Lindow Man's {{last meal}} was {{preserved}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> and intestines and was analysed in some detail. It was hoped that {{investigations into the}} contents of the stomach would shed light on the contemporary diet, {{as was the case with}} Grauballe Man and Tollund Man in the 1950s. The analysis of {{the contents of the}} digestive system of bog bodies had become one of the principal endeavours of investigating such remains. Analysis of the grains present revealed his diet to be mostly of cereals. He probably ate slightly charred bread, although the burning may have had ritual significance rather than being an accident. Some mistletoe pollen was also found in the stomach, indicating that Lindow Man died in March or April.|$|E

25|$|It {{occurred}} in 1776 {{when a man}} called Awang returned to Padang (now known as Parit Raja, Muar) after more than 3 years abroad to marry his fiancée Dayang. Upon his return, {{he found out that}} another man called Bachok at Pa'achok had told Dayang of Awang's death and she was to be married to him the next day. Awang showed up at the wedding and using a twin spear given by Raja Bugis, he speared Bachok in the stomach. Bachok, fatally injured, grabbed the spear <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> and speared his best man. The man then speared the next man he saw and this was repeated until the 99th person was speared. It was Dayang's father who was protecting Dayang. He did not continue the repeated spearing and died. Awang ran away to Endau and Dayang did not marry another until she died.|$|E
25|$|Upon Chamberlain's resignation, Lyttelton succeeded him as Colonial Secretary, {{despite his}} {{relative}} political inexperience. His {{decision to allow}} Chinese indentured labour into South Africa proved highly controversial and became a major issue for the Liberals in the 1906 election. Lyttelton also attempted ambitious reforms of Britain's management of the colonies towards a more decentralised, imperial vision, but these ideas were abandoned by the Liberals who succeeded him. After the Conservatives' fall from power, Lyttelton remained active politically, opposing Welsh disestablishment and supporting women's suffrage. In the summer of 1913, he was struck in the belly during a cricket match in South Africa. Shortly after his return to Britain, he was taken ill at the Foreign Office and an operation revealed {{the presence of an}} abscess <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b> Surgery was unsuccessful and he died, in a nursing home, early in July. His funeral took place {{on the day of the}} annual Varsity cricket match, and play between Oxford and Cambridge was suspended for two minutes as a mark of respect.|$|E

But he was in that period of the early forties when a doctor sometimes has a matter-of-fact, disagreeable wife whose idea stands between him and the spiritual intimacy of his patients, so that it seems as if they were delivering their confidences rather to her than to him.

25|$|Held in a {{prisoner}} of war camp, Clifton soon managed to escape and made his way as far as the Swiss border before being recaptured. Transferred to a punishment camp at Gavi, he made three further escape attempts, the last of which was in September 1943 and involved the digging of a tunnel with 60 other prisoners. Detected before they could break out, the prisoners were moved to a camp in Germany. While en route, Clifton jumped from the train transporting them through Germany. His escape was short lived and while hiding in a bush near the train tracks, he was shot in the leg and stomach by a guard. Other prisoners, under guard, retrieved him and dressed his wounds. Taken to a hospital, he was treated for his wounds; the bullet, which had lodged <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach,</b> was later given to him as a souvenir. In March 1944, after recuperating for four months, he was placed in a camp near Hadamar which was specially designated for recidivist escapees.|$|E

500|$|Scotland Yard {{initially}} investigated {{claims that}} Litvinenko was poisoned with thallium. [...] It {{was reported that}} early tests appeared to confirm {{the presence of the}} poison. Among the distinctive effects of thallium poisoning are hair loss and damage to peripheral nerves, and a photograph of Litvinenko in hospital, released to the media on his behalf, indeed showed his hair to have fallen out. Litvinenko attributed his initial survival to his cardiovascular fitness and swift medical treatment. [...] It was later suggested a radioactive isotope of thallium might have been used to poison Litvinenko. Dr. Amit Nathwani, one of Litvinenko's physicians, said [...] "His symptoms are slightly odd for thallium poisoning, and the chemical levels of thallium we were able to detect are not the kind of levels you'd see in toxicity." [...] Litvinenko's condition deteriorated, and he was moved into intensive care on 20 November. Hours before his death, three unidentified circular-shaped objects were found <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> via an X-ray scan. It is thought these objects were almost certainly shadows caused by the presence of Prussian blue, the treatment he had been given for thallium poisoning.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{visual effects}} supervisor, Andrew Orloff of Zoic Studios {{tried to make}} the {{parasitic}} worms look as real as possible. He explained, [...] "...we just don't have any shots that seemed staged for the camera or any hint of being a visual effect. One of the big effects, like the parasite that crawls out of the guy's mouth, are interacting with actor's performances and they're shot with a very loose camera style and we have to have the tentacles of this creature coming out of the guy's mouth and all the deformations that are <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> and in his throat and in his chest." [...] Orloff continued, [...] "And we had to create a proprietary workflow here of what we're calling performance transfer of tracking 2D points, and putting those 2D tracked points onto the formation of 3D inter-geometry. So we're transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors on set onto 3D pieces of geometry so we can deform them and warp them and have our effects interact with them because the mandate is all about making it look as natural as possible, so that means a lot of optical tricks and atmosphere put in as seamlessly as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Cronos– The {{father of}} Zeus, Hades, Poseidon, and Hera. Cronos learned of a prophecy that foretold {{that one of}} his {{children}} would become greater than he. In an attempt to cheat fate, Cronos devoured his own children and imprisoned them <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b> Due to the trickery by Cronos' wife Rhea, the young child Zeus was spared the fate of his siblings, and secretly grew to manhood. Zeus freed his siblings and defeated Cronos and the Titans in the Great War. In an attempt to change his fate, Cronos offered a gift, the gigantic stone [...] "Steeds of Time", to the Sisters of Fate, but they declined his request. He also left magic, [...] "Cronos' Rage", in the Steeds, which Kratos acquired during his quest for the Sisters. As punishment for Cronos' role in the Great War, Zeus forced the Titan to crawl through the Desert of Lost Souls with Pandora's Temple chained to his back. In God of War III, Kratos traveled to Tartarus in search of the Omphalos Stone where he was confronted by a vengeful Cronos (who still had Pandora's Temple chained to his back). The Titan blamed Kratos for Gaia's death and his imprisonment, as when Kratos penetrated the Temple and retrieved the Box in God of War, a fearful Zeus cast Cronos into Tartarus. The Titan was then killed in battle by Kratos with the Blade of Olympus. The character was voiced by Lloyd Sherr in God of War II, and George Ball in God of War III.|$|E
500|$|Crookedstar's Promise was {{released}} on 5 July 2011. It {{takes place at the}} same time as Bluestar's Prophecy and details the life of Crookedstar, initially Stormkit. As a kit, Stormkit falls into the river after he sneaks out of camp and attempts to chase ThunderClan medicine cat Goosefeather away from Sunningrocks, a part of RiverClan territory (at the time). This leads him to break his jaw on a rock. [...] Rainflower, Stormkit's mother, rejects Stormkit due to his disfigured appearance and demands that RiverClan leader Hailstar perform a renaming ceremony to rename Stormkit to Crookedkit. Feeling rejected, Crookedkit is visited in a dream by Mapleshade, a Dark Forest cat who allows Crookedkit to believe that she is from StarClan. She tells him that she can give him anything he wants as long as he is faithful to his Clan and puts all other things aside. Crookedkit quickly accepts this promise, believing it not to be a difficult promise, as he was already loyal to his Clan, and believes that Mapleshade can help him become leader. Mapleshade then uses Crookedkit's promise to seemingly bring about the deaths of Crookedkit's loved ones. When Crookedjaw is chasing away a dog, the dog knocks his mother, Rainflower, into a river, and she hits her head on rocks. Mapleshade urges Crookedjaw to focus on the dog instead of bringing his mother to the medicine cat, and she dies. Crookedjaw then becomes deputy upon his father Shellheart's retirement; shortly after, Shellheart dies of a lump <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b> Not long after, Hailstar loses his last life while fighting rats in a barn: although Mapleshade urges him to not protect Hailstar so he can become leader, Crookedjaw ignores her, having discovered that she is actually from the Dark Forest. Nonetheless, Hailstar is killed. Despite his insistence that she stay away from him, Mapleshade continues to haunt Crookedstar: his mate, Willowbreeze, dies of a respiratory infection days after giving birth to his three kits, and two of the kits die as well. When Crookedstar confronts Mapleshade, she reveals that she had once been the mate of Crookedstar's great-grandfather. Mapleshade had been a ThunderClan cat, while her mate had been from RiverClan: Mapleshade is rejected by her Clan for taking a forbidden mate, then loses the kits in the river when she attempts to bring them to RiverClan. Her mate blames her for letting the kits drown in the river, and RiverClan, too, rejects Mapleshade. As a result, Mapleshade vows revenge on her mates descendants, one of whom is Crookedstar. When Crookedstar finally reveals his promise and his belief that it caused the deaths of his loved ones, to his medicine cat Brambleberry, she argues that the deaths were not in fact Mapleshade's fault. Following the conclusion of the novel, Oakheart is killed, then in the manga feature, Silverstream, Crookedstar's only remaining kit, dies after giving birth to Graystripe of ThunderClan's kits. Mapleshade asserts that these deaths were her doing as well, but Crookedstar tells Mapleshade that she has failed to punish him, as his loved ones live on in StarClan, while she has no one. Finally, Crookedstar dies as well. A sad ending, but it has to fit in with the rest of the series.|$|E
