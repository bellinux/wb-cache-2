50|$|Conductors, {{typically}} {{in the form}} of wires, may be used to transmit electrical energy or signals using an alternating current flowing through that conductor. The charge carriers constituting that current, usually electrons, are driven by an electric field due to the source of electrical energy. An alternating current in a conductor produces an alternating magnetic field in and around the conductor. When the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> in a conductor changes, the magnetic field also changes. The change in the magnetic field, in turn, creates an electric field which opposes the change in current intensity. This opposing electric field is called “counter-electromotive force” (back EMF). The back EMF is strongest {{at the center of the}} conductor, and forces the conducting electrons to the outside of the conductor, as shown in the diagram on the right.|$|E
50|$|Laterolog tools send an {{electric}} current from an electrode on the sonde {{directly into the}} formation. The return electrodes are located either on surface or on the sonde itself. Complex arrays of electrodes on the sonde (guard electrodes) focus the current into the formation and prevent current lines from fanning out or flowing directly to the return electrode through the borehole fluid. Most tools vary the voltage at the main electrode {{in order to maintain}} a constant current intensity. This voltage is therefore proportional to the resistivity of the formation. Because current must flow from the sonde to the formation, these tools only work with conductive borehole fluid. Actually, since the resistivity of the mud is measured in series with the resistivity of the formation, laterolog tools give best results when mud resistivity is low with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., in salty mud. Induction logs use {{an electric}} coil in the sonde to generate an alternating current loop in the formation by induction. This is the same physical principle as is used in electric transformers. The alternating current loop, in turn, induces a current in a receiving coil located elsewhere on the sonde. The amount of current in the receiving coil is proportional to the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> loop, hence to the conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) of the formation. Multiple transmitting and receiving coils are used to focus formation current loops both radially (depth of investigation) and axially (vertical resolution). Until the late 80’s, the workhorse of induction logging has been the 6FF40 sonde which is made up of six coils with a nominal spacing of 40 in. Since the 90’s all major logging companies use so-called array induction tools. These comprise a single transmitting coil and a large number of receiving coils. Radial and axial focusing is performed by software rather than by the physical layout of coils. Since the formation current flows in circular loops around the logging tool, mud resistivity is measured in parallel with formation resistivity. Induction tools therefore give best results when mud resistivity is high with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., fresh mud or non-conductive fluid. In oil-base mud, which is non conductive, induction logging is the only option available.|$|E

We show that #eld-aligned currents measured byFreja in the auroral region have {{a spectrum of}} scales from # 500 km down to the electron inertial length # e = c=! pe whichistypicaly #hundrets m. The <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>currents</b> increases inversely proportional to the spatial scale and reaches # 300 #Am, 2 at the smallest scales. At kilometer scales, the current is carried mainly by thermal electrons with energetic electron contributions less than # 20 #. At large scales, the plasma densityvariations are not correlated with the magnetic #eld variations but with the amplitude of ACvariations. Small scale currents are intimately related to small scale cavities and inertial Alfv#en waves. We discuss also vector polarization of the magnetic perturbations at various scales which {{may be used as}} a tool for resolving some ambiguities in the spatial versus tem [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Inspired by Weber's Law, {{this paper}} proposes a simple, yet very {{powerful}} and robust local descriptor, called the Weber Local Descriptor (WLD). It {{is based on}} the fact that human perception of a pattern depends not only on the change of a stimulus (such as sound, lighting) but also on the original <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> the stimulus. Specifically, WLD consists of two components: differential excitation and orientation. The differential excitation component is a function of the ratio between two terms: one is the relative <b>intensity</b> differences <b>of</b> a <b>current</b> pixel against its neighbors; the other is the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>current</b> pixel. The orientation component is the gradient orientation <b>of</b> the <b>current</b> pixel. For a given image, we use the two components to construct a concatenated WLD histogram. Experimental results on the Brodatz and KTH-TIPS 2 -a texture databases show that WLD impressively outperforms the other widely used descriptors (e. g., Gabor and SIFT). In addition, experimental results on human face detection also show a promising performance comparable to the best known results on the MIT+CMU fronta...|$|R

Still {{these results}} did {{not prove that}} {{variation}} in the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>current</b> was not accompanied by a corresponding variation in the electro-chemical effects, since the actions at all the surfaces might have increased or diminished together. The deficiency in the evidence is, however, completely supplied by the former experiments on different-sized electrodes; for with variation {{in the size of}} these, a variation in the intensity must have occurred. The <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> an electric <b>current</b> traversing conductors alike in their nature, quality, and length, is probably as the quantity of electricity passing through a given sectional area perpendicular to the current, divided by the time (360. note); and therefore when large plates were contrasted with wires separated by an equal length of the same decomposing conductor (714.), whilst one <b>current</b> <b>of</b> electricity passed through both arrangements, that electricity must have been in a very different state, as to tension, between the plates and between the wires; yet the chemical results were the same.|$|R
40|$|Hand tremor {{measurement}} {{was evaluated}} {{in a group}} of 54 male workers (mean age 38. 5 years) exposed to mercury vapor (average duration of exposure 7. 7 years) using an accelerometer test and two psychomotor tests (eye-hand coordination and hand steadiness). The results were compared with those obtained in a well-matched control group of 48 workers. The <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> mercury vapor exposure was rather moderate as reflected by the mean (geometric) levels of mercury in blood (2. 4 micrograms/dl) and in urine (63 micrograms/g creatinine). The hand steadiness test and eye-hand coordination test revealed preclinical alterations in postural and intentional tremor, whereas the changes evidenced by the accelerometer test were not statistically significant. Furthermore the practical advantage of the psychomotor tests over the accelerometer test makes them most appropriate for the early detection of mercury-induced hand tremor. The present study also suggests that young adults (less than 21 years) may be more susceptible to the neurotoxic effect of mercury vapor...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we studied {{the effect of}} plasma current sheath {{symmetry}} on pinched plasma intensity in Amirkabir Mather type plasma focus (APF) facility (16 kV, 36 µf, and 115 nH) by the three magnetic probes spaced equally around {{the periphery of the}} outer electrode at the heights of z 1 = 4. 3 cm and z 2 = 6. 3 cm from the cathode collector plate. The arrival times of current sheath reaching to the probes and also the signal of current discharge recorded simultaneously on a four channel 100 MHz PC based oscilloscope. Simulated trajectory, velocity and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> sheath compared with the experimental results when Argon puffed into the chamber. There was a good accordance among plasma current sheath symmetry in the axial acceleration phase of plasma focus performance and intensity of pinched plasma current in the radial phase of current sheath.

Using panel data from the Central Highlands of Ethiopia matched with corresponding village-level rainfall data, {{the results show that}} the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> year's fertilizer use is positively associated with higher rainfall levels experienced in the previous year. Rainfall variability, on the other hand, impacts fertilizer use decisions negatively, implying that variability raises the risks and uncertainty associated with fertilizer use. Abundant rainfall in the previous year could depict relaxed liquidity constraints and increased affordability of fertilizer, which makes rainfall availability critical in severely credit-constrained environments. In light of similar existing literature, the major contribution of the study is that it uses panel data to explicitly examine farmers' responses to actual weather changes and variability. © 2010 International Association of Agricultural Economists...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNew accelerators like SPIRAL 2 (GANIL, France) or FAIR (GSI, Germany) will be soon constructed, {{and they}} will be able to produce {{radioactive}} ion beams (RIB) with high <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> (>= 106 pps). These beams, at low energy, lower than 20 MeV/n, usually have high emittance, which imposes the use of tracking detectors before the target in order to reconstruct the trajectory of the ions. The group of Nuclear Physics at CNA (Centro Nacional de Aceleradores), is in charge of developing a tracking system for the low energy branch of FAIR (the HISPEC/DESPEC project). A collaboration with CEA-SACLAY was established, with the aim of developing, building and testing low pressure Secondary electron Detectors (SeD). Within this proposal we have projected and constructed a new Nuclear Physics Line in the CNA in order to be able to receive any kind of detector tests and the associated nuclear instruments...|$|R
40|$|Submarine canyons {{are major}} geomorphic {{features}} of continental margins around the world. Several recent multidisciplinary projects {{focused on the}} study of canyons have considerably increased our understanding of their ecological role, the goods, and services they provide to human populations, and the impacts that human activities have on their overall ecological condition. Pressures from human activities include fishing, dumping of land-based mine tailings, and oil and gas extraction. Moreover, hydrodynamic processes of canyons enhance the down-canyon transport of litter. The effects of climate change may modify the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>currents.</b> This potential hydrographic change is predicted to impact the structure and functioning of canyon communities as well as affect nutrient supply to the deep-ocean ecosystem. This review not only identifies the ecological status <b>of</b> canyons, and <b>current</b> and future issues for canyon conservation, but also highlights the need for a better understanding of anthropogenic impacts on canyon ecosystems and proposes other research required to inform management measures to protect canyon ecosystems...|$|R
