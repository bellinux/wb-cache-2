50|$|After works {{had been}} {{completed}} on the raffinate splitter, consideration {{was given to the}} impending start-up of the plant. One of the primary safety critical steps in the prestart-up process was the use of the BP Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) procedure. The purpose of the review was to ensure that complete and thorough technical checks were carried out and that all non-essential personnel were clear during the start-up operation. Once completed, the PSSR would be signed off by refinery operations and safety managers, authorising the start-up work but this essential safety procedure was not completed. In addition, {{there were a number of}} serious issues with items of safety critical equipment which had not been resolved prior to the start-up commencing including an inoperative pressure control valve (PV-5002), a defective <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>alarm</b> in the splitter tower (LSH-5102), a defective sight glass used to indicate fluid levels at the base of the splitter tower and the vital splitter tower level transmitter had not been calibrated.|$|E
5000|$|Investigating this {{pressure}} spike, the Day Board Operator fully opened the level control valve {{to the heavy}} raffinate storage tank and shut off of the gas fueling the furnace, but the raffinate feed into the splitter tower was not shut off. Hot raffinate flowed into the blowdown drum and stack and as it filled, some of the fluid started to flow into the ISOM unit sewer system via a 6 in pipeline {{at the base of}} the blowdown drum, but the <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>alarm</b> for the blowdown drum didn't sound. As the blowdown drum and stack filled up, hot raffinate shot out of the top of the stack and into the air, forming a 20 ft [...] "geyser". The hot raffinate rained down on the ground and ran down the side of the blow-down drum and stack and pooled {{at the base of the}} unit. A radio call was received in the control room that hot hydrocarbons were overflowing from the stack. A pick-up truck, with its engine running, had been carelessly parked within 30 ft of the blowdown stack; the vapor cloud reached the vehicle, and hydrocarbon fumes were drawn directly into the air intake valve, causing the engine to race. Nearby workers frantically tried to shut down the engine, without success. The expanding vapor cloud forced the workers who were trying to shut down the overspeeding truck engine to retreat. The cloud continued to spread across the ISOM plant, across the pipe-rack to the West and into the trailer area unimpeded. No emergency alarm sounded, and at approximately 1:20 p.m., the vapor cloud was ignited by a backfire seen from the overheating truck engine by nearby witnesses, producing a massive explosion that was heard for miles. The blast pressure wave struck the contractor trailers, either completely destroying or severely damaging many of them. The force of the explosion sent debris flying, instantly killing 15 people in and around the trailers and severely injuring 180 others. The pressure wave was so powerful it blew out windows off site up to a distance of 3/4 mi away. An area estimated at 200000 sq ft of the refinery was badly burned by the subsequent fire that followed the violent explosion, damaging millions of dollars worth of refinery equipment. The entire ISOM unit was severely damaged by the explosion and subsequent fire, and as a result, remained out of operation for more than 2 years.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem with}} {{high water level}} alarm that led to power {{shutdown}} did first occurred on the 3 rd of May 2008 at Ringhals 1. In the beginning there was a theory that boiling triggered the measurement system that consists of a floating switch, {{it has not been}} verified if the alarm was triggered by steam or liquid. During the investigation process data was collected from Vattenfalls’ information systems and a RELAP 5 model of the drainage system. This model was built with the purpose of simulating different scenario and to gather data that Vattenfall was lacking. It was first stated from Vattenfall that power shutdown was avoided on the 9 th of May due to opening a valve more gradually. Analyzes comparing the cases 3 rd of May and 9 th of May show that the conditions was not equal enough to make the conclusion. Model simulations show that both super heaters take half of the mass flow (assuming negligible differences) from the high pressure turbine under all circumstances, therefore the crossflow pipe takes the other half in cases on the 3 rd and 9 th of May 2008. A theory that one of the super heaters at 3 rd of May was overloaded is not the case according to the model. Liquid that was accumulated and dumped from pipe systems and then triggered the <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>alarm</b> was investigated. Results show that the pipe system after the drainage tank can acquire enough water if it is assumed that the water is pushed up into the tank from a back flow. The main goal should be to examine the measured data that occurs more than 3 hours before the <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>alarm</b> is triggered and caused a power shutdown at 3 rd of May.

Attending to information over and above social behaviour per se may provide a strategy by which the reliability of social information is ensured. Earlier work in Indian mynahs, Sturnus tristis, has demonstrated that observers become more wary in a location {{in which they are}} accustomed to foraging after they have viewed a conspecific undergo a ‘predator’ attack at that site.

40|$|Socially {{acquired}} predator avoidance is {{a phenomenon}} in which individuals acquire an avoidance response towards an initially neutral stimulus after they have experienced it together with the antipredator signals of social companions. Earlier research has established that alarm calls used for intraspecific communication are effective stimuli for triggering acquisition. However, animals produce a large range of other antipredator responses that might engage antipredator learning. Here, I {{examine the effects of}} conspecific distress calls, a signal that is produced by birds when restrained by a predator, and that appears to be directed towards predators, rather than conspecifics, on predator avoidance learning in Indian mynahs, Acridotheres tristis. Distress calls reflect <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>alarm</b> in the caller and should, therefore, mediate robust learning. Experiment 1 revealed that subjects performed higher rates of head movements in response to a previously unfamiliar avian mount after it had been presented simultaneously with playbacks of conspecific distress vocalizations. Experiment 2 revealed that increased rates of head saccades resembled the spontaneous response evoked by a novel stimulus more closely than it resembled the response evoked by a perched raptor, suggesting that distress calls inculcated a visual exploratory response, rather than an antipredator response. While it is usually thought that the level of acquisition in learners follows a simple relationship with the <b>level</b> of <b>alarm</b> shown by demonstrators, the present results suggest that this relationship may be more complex.

Otherwise, friendly fire incidences occur, also known as “fratricide. ” During World War II and the Vietnam War, 2 % to 3 % of U. S. casualties were due to fratricide. Forty-five years later, in Operation “Desert Storm, ” the first Iraq war saw rising rates, with overall casualties due to fratricide near 24 % (Koehler, 1992). In fact, fratricide accounted for 77 % of the combat damaged sustained by U. S. armored vehicles during this conflict (Koehler).

US Asia–Pacific foreign policy is discussed widely and actively in China. Understanding the nuances of China’s differentiated response from the time of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 2011 ‘America’s Pacific Century’ essay in Foreign Policy magazine is important: it makes us examine the accuracy of Western perceptions of China’s ‘stance’ on US foreign policy in the Asia– Pacific.

40|$|Abstract- Effective fusion and {{tracking}} of multistatic active sonar contacts is challenging, due to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of false <b>alarm</b> clutter present on all sonar nodes. Such false alarms often overload the sensor-to-fusion-center communications links and fusion/tracking processes, producing too many false tracks. The Specular-Cued Surveillance Web (SPECSweb) multistatic tracker mitigates these problems through implementation of two amplitude thresholds: a high threshold {{used to identify}} the occurrence of high-strength specular detection cues for track initiation, and a low threshold for selective extraction of additional detections within retrieval snippets for track extension forward and backward in time. This approach can significantly reduce the data rate at the input to the fusion/tracking algorithm, and reduce node-to-fusion-center communication link throughput requirements. This paper provides performance results of this tracking algorithm on simulated multistatic data sets from the Multistatic Tracking Working Group (MSTWG).

40|$|Alarm {{signalling}} is {{of paramount}} importance to communication in all social insects. In termites, vibroacoustic and chemical alarm signalling are bound to operate synergistically but have never been studied simultaneously in a single species. Here, we inspected the functional significance of both communication channels in Constrictotermes cyphergaster (Termitidae: Nasutitermitinae), confirming the hypothesis that these are not exclusive, but rather complementary processes. In natural situations, the alarm predominantly attracts soldiers, which actively search for the source of a disturbance. Laboratory testing revealed that the frontal gland of soldiers produces a rich mixture of terpenoid compounds including an alarm pheromone. Extensive testing led to identification of the alarm pheromone being composed of abundant monoterpene hydrocarbons (1 S) -α-pinene and myrcene, along with a minor component, (E) -β-ocimene. The vibratory alarm signalling consists of vibratory movements evidenced as bursts; a series of beats produced predominantly by soldiers. Exposing termite groups to various mixtures containing the alarm pheromone (crushed soldier heads, frontal gland extracts, mixture of all monoterpenes, and the alarm pheromone mixture made of standards) resulted in significantly higher activity in the tested groups and also increased intensity of the vibratory alarm communication, with the responses clearly dose-dependent. Lower doses of the pheromone provoked higher numbers of vibratory signals compared to higher doses. Higher doses induced long-term running of all termites without stops necessary to perform vibratory behaviour. Surprisingly, even crushed worker heads led to low (but significant) increases in the alarm responses, suggesting that other unknown compound in the worker's head is perceived and answered by termites. Our results demonstrate the existence of different <b>alarm</b> <b>levels</b> in termites, with lower levels being communicated through vibratory signals, and <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> causing general <b>alarm</b> or retreat being communicated through the alarm pheromone...|$|R

5000|$|Below {{is a list}} of the <b>alarm</b> <b>levels</b> used in the {{response}} policy of the New York City Fire Department. This is a basic example of how <b>alarm</b> <b>levels</b> are categorized in a fire department, how many fire apparatuses respond to each <b>alarm</b> <b>level,</b> etc. In New York, however, additional special <b>alarm</b> <b>levels</b> are utilized, aside from the conventional 1st alarm, 2nd alarm, 3rd alarm, etc. Examples of such <b>alarm</b> <b>levels</b> are the signal 10-75 assignment, the signals 10-76 and 10-77 assignments, and the signal 10-60 assignment. A 10-75 is a working fire (i.e., there is fire visible from a building), the 10-76/10-77 assignments are the <b>alarm</b> <b>levels</b> separate from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd alarms, etc. that are the standard fire department responses to fires in high-rise buildings. The signal 10-60 is a separate response to major disasters.|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been mammoth growth in the world {{population}} which has {{also contributed to the}} voluminous growth of vehicles. As a consequence of this, the numbers of accidents on roads have also increased to a large extent. Our system is an attempt to mitigate the same using synchronous programming language. The aim is to develop a safety crash warning system that will address the rear end crashes and also take over the controlling of the vehicle when the threat is at a very <b>high</b> <b>level.</b> Adapting according to the environmental conditions is also a prominent feature of the system. Safety System provides warnings to drivers to assist in avoiding rear-end crashes with other vehicles. Initially the system provides a low <b>level</b> <b>alarm</b> and as the severity of the threat increases the level of warnings or alerts also rises. At the <b>highest</b> <b>level</b> of threat, the system enters in a Cruise Control Mode, wherein the system controls the speed of the vehicle by controlling the engine throttle and if permitted, the brake system of the vehicle. We focus on this crash area as it has a very high percentage of the crash-related fatalities. A reference implementation of the safety algorithm in ESTEREL is proposed, which is also formally verified along with the proofs of various properties that the system obeys...|$|R
