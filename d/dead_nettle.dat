60|$|Plate XII. {{represents}} the most characteristic types of the blossoms of Menthæ, in the profile and front views, {{all a little}} magnified. The upper two are white basil, purple spotted--growing here at Brantwood always with two terminal flowers. The two middle figures are the purple-spotted <b>dead</b> <b>nettle,</b> Lamium maculatum; and the two lower, thyme: but I {{have not been able}} to draw these as I wanted, the perspectives of the petals being too difficult, and inexplicable to the eye even in the flowers themselves without continually putting them in changed positions.|$|E
6000|$|Linnaeus, in 1758, grouped {{the family}} into two divisions, by {{the form of}} the calyx, (five-fold or two-fold), and then went into the wildest {{confusion}} in distinction of species,--sometimes by the form of corolla, sometimes by that of calyx, sometimes by that of the filaments, sometimes by that of the stigma, and sometimes by that of the seed. As, for instance, thyme is to be identified by the calyx having hairs in its throat, <b>dead</b> <b>nettle</b> by having bristles in its mouth, lion's tail by having bones in its anthers (antheræ punctis osseis adspersæ), and teucrium by having its upper lip cut in two! ...|$|E

50|$|Tritomegas bicolor, the pied shield bug, is {{a species}} of shield bug found in Europe. The adult is {{black and white and}} 5.5 - 7 mm long. It is found across North Africa, Europe and Central Asia, {{although}} in the British Isles, it becomes rarer towards the north, and is absent from Scotland and Ireland. T. bicolor lives mainly on the ground, but is also visible on its host plants — chiefly Lamium (<b>dead</b> <b>nettles)</b> and Ballota nigra (black horehound).|$|R

50|$|A {{comparison}} of vegetation surveys of Scotstown Moor, performed in 1968 and 1998, {{shows that the}} number of plant species in the area has declined. Species have been lost from all habitat types, although those of the open water and open/waste ground have suffered the most. For example, marsh arrowgrass (Triglochin palustris), early marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza incarnata), common twayblade (Listera cordata), corn spurrey (Spergula arvensis) and various species of <b>dead</b> <b>nettle</b> (Lamium spp.) have all been lost from the site.|$|E
40|$|We tested {{predictions}} {{from the}} theory that ovipositing females of phytophagous insects are limited by their neural capacity for information processing. Previous {{studies have found that}} relatively specialized insects make faster and/or more accurate identifications of host plants compared to generalists. The study species was the polyphagous comma butterfly, Polygonia c-album (Nymphalidae). We compared females originating from two populations (Sweden and England) which differ in degree of specialization on the preferred host Urtica dioica (Urticaceae). Females were given a choice between this plant and a very similar nonhost, white <b>dead</b> <b>nettle,</b> Laminum album (Lamiacease), or a choice between a relatively poor host, Betuala pubescens, and the nonhost Betula pendula (Betulaceae). Oviposition rate was lower in cages with Betula compared to cages with Urtica, demonstrating that P. c-album females will withhold eggs when preferred hosts are not available. As predicted, females originating from the Swedish generalist population oviposited more often on the nonhost Lamium. However, females of both populations discriminated very strongly against oviposition on B. pendula. We found that newly hatched larvae have some ability to move from herbaceous nonhost to hosts. Although alternative interpretations are possible, the results give further support to the hypothesis that there are trade-offs between diet breadth and the ability to discriminate among plants.

500|$|In October 1996, {{the group}} rented a mansion in Rancho Santa Fe, California. That year, they {{recorded}} two video messages {{in which they}} offered their viewers a [...] "last chance to evacuate Earth". Around the same time, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp. Applewhite now believed that Nettles was aboard a spaceship trailing the comet, and that she planned to rendezvous with them. He told his followers that the vessel would transport them to an empyrean destination, {{and that there was}} a government conspiracy to suppress word of the craft. In addition, he stated that his deceased followers would be taken by the vessel as well, a belief that resembled the Christian pretribulation rapture doctrine. It is not known how he learned of the comet or why he believed that it was accompanied by extraterrestrials or why he should have believed the <b>dead</b> <b>Nettles</b> would be with them.|$|R
60|$|At Northchapel Mr. Hoopdriver {{consulted}} his map {{and took}} counsel and weighed his course of action. Petworth seemed a possible resting-place, or Pullborough; Midhurst seemed too near, and any {{place over the}} Downs beyond, too far, and so he meandered towards Petworth, posing himself perpetually and loitering, gathering wild flowers and wondering why they had no names--for {{he had never heard}} of any--dropping them furtively {{at the sight of a}} stranger, and generally 'mucking about.' There were purple vetches in the hedges, meadowsweet, honeysuckle, belated brambles--but the dog-roses had already gone; there were green and red blackberries, stellarias, and dandelions, and in another place white <b>dead</b> <b>nettles,</b> traveller's-joy, clinging bedstraw, grasses flowering, white campions, and ragged robins. One cornfield was glorious with poppies, bright scarlet and purple white, and the blue corn-flowers were beginning. In the lanes the trees met overhead, and the wisps of hay still hung to the straggling hedges. Iri one of the main roads he steered a perilous passage through a dozen surly dun oxen. Here and there were little cottages, and picturesque beer-houses with the vivid brewers' boards of blue and scarlet, and once a broad green and a church, and an expanse of some hundred houses or so. Then he came to a pebbly rivulet that emerged between clumps of sedge loosestrife and forget-me-nots under an arch of trees, and rippled across the road, and there he dismounted, longing to take off shoes and stockings--those stylish chequered stockings were now all dimmed with dust--and paddle his lean legs in the chuckling cheerful water. But instead he sat in a manly attitude, smoking a cigarette, for fear lest the Young Lady in Grey should come glittering round the corner. For the flavour of the Young Lady in Grey was present through it all, mixing with the flowers and all the delight of it, a touch that made this second day quite different from the first, an undertone of expectation, anxiety, and something like regret that would not be ignored.|$|R
40|$|Group {{work was}} {{researched}} for felling, processing, skidding and quality inspection activities in mountainous broadleaf thinning stands with {{approximately the same}} terrain and stand conditions. The stands were 55 and 70 years old. In the forest communities of the mountainous beech forest with <b>dead</b> <b>nettle</b> (Lamio orvale – Fagetum sylvaticae/Ht. 1938) and the forests of the sessile oak and horn beam with beech (Epimedio – Carpinetum betuli var. Fagus sylvatica/Ht. 1938 /Borth. 1963), the main tree species are beech and sessile oak {{with the addition of}} other broadleaf species. Productivity was examined in two groups. The first comprised of five workers (A) and the second of four workers (B). The first group was equipped with two tractors and three chain saws while the second used two tractors and two chain saws as well as other necessary equipment. The effective time of the cutters spent on felling ranged from 36 to 42. 9 %, finishing and measurement took up 21 %, while the effective time for the tractors ranged from 42. 4 to 59 %. The effective time per tree ranged from 3. 62 to 3. 77 minutes, i. e. from 8. 46 min/m 3 to 12. 91 min/m 3 per unit. The daily output achieved by the Ecotrac and Torpedo tractors at a distance of 300 meters was 20. 77. m 3 /day for group A, while the optimised output was 67. 02 m 3 /day. The output achieved by both tractors in group B was 17. 25 m 3 /day while the optimised output was 30. 72 m 3 /day. The average performance per worker in group A was 4. 15. m 3 /day while the optimised performance was 8. 38 m 3 /day. For group B the average performance per worker was 4. 31. m 3 /day and the optimised performance was 7. 68 m 3 /day. The optimisation of the groups lowered the unit cost of production (300 m distance) for group A from 21. 36 EUR/m 3 t...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: The study {{presents}} the results of an investigation of regeneration processes, growth, development and survival of young growth by field measurement and three-dimensional visualization of horizontal and vertical structure. The results are based on the ten-year investigation (1998 - 2009) on a permanent experimental plot in a mountain beech forest with <b>dead</b> <b>nettle</b> tree (Lamio orvale - Fagetum sylvaticae Ht. 1938) in conditions of passive protection. Materials and Methods: Basic structural indicators were measured (diameter at breast height and height), structural crown elements (size and shape, ground cover crowns) and the occurrence and survival of young growth as the basic conditions of natural regeneration. Particular emphasis in the investigation was paid to the development of crown structures and the process of natural regeneration during the 10 year period. Results and Conclusions: Investigation indicates the occurrence of young growth regeneration cores arising {{as a result of the}} die-back of one dominant beech tree with horizontal crown projections of 145 m 2 which initiated the possibility of natural regeneration. The greatest change occurred in the beech seedling count, whose numbers increased fourfold from 3556 plants per hectare in 1998 to 12694 plants per hectare in 2009. The share of beech seedlings increased from 8. 7 % to 22. 6 % of all species of young growth and shrubs. Thus beech became dominant among the tree species regeneration. However, the majority of the young plants of beech are of poor quality and thus their further development in conditions of passive protection is questionable. The investigations also showed the possibility of a new approach to the study of the dynamics of crown structures and the process of natural regeneration by methods of three-dimensional visualization of horizontal and vertical structures. The methods presented offer a more graphic illustration of the development of stands and high quality presentation of the obtained results. For a long-term scientifically based plan, with the aim of reaching the most favourable decisions on the future of forest stands in protected areas, particularly in today’s conditions of climatic changes, continuous improvement and expansion of monitoring methods by means of a network of permanent experimental plots in all protected forest areas is necessary...|$|E
60|$|Totila and the Goths {{came down}} {{once more to}} Rome. Belisarius in agony sent for reinforcements, and got them; but too late. He could not relieve Rome. The Goths had massed {{themselves}} round the city, and Belisarius, having got to Ostia (Portus) at the Tiber's mouth, could get no further. This was the last woe; the actual death-agony of ancient Rome. The famine grew and grew. The wretched Romans cried to Bessas and his garrison, either to feed them or to kill {{them out of their}} misery. They would do neither. They could hardly at last feed themselves. The Romans ate nettles off the ruins, and worse things still. There was not a dog or a rat left. They even killed themselves. One father of five children could bear no longer their cries for food. He wrapped his head in his mantle, and sprang into the Tiber, while the children looked on. The survivors wandered about like spectres, brown with hunger, and dropped <b>dead</b> with half-chewed <b>nettles</b> between their lips. To this, says Procopius, had fortune brought the Roman senate and people. Nay, not fortune, but wickedness. They had wished to play at being free, while they themselves were the slaves of sin.|$|R
