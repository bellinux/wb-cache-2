But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
5|$|Member states remain optimistic of {{the union}} and key {{partners}} in the region, namely China, Iran, Turkey remain <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> A common belief is that the Eurasian Economic Union has significant potential {{over the next two}} decades, with experts predicting a 25 percent growth in the member states' GDP by 2030, which equates to over US$600 billion. The agreement will give member state citizens access to employment and education across the union. It will also entail collaborative policies in many sectors, including agriculture, energy, technology and transportation. These collaborative policies are particularly interesting for countries in Asia seeking access to energy, trade routes in Central Asia and Siberia, and agricultural goods.|$|E
5|$|Born in Tokyo, Japan, on July 5, 1968, Ito became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} four. He began to learn to play the piano, becoming <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> after hearing piano music coming from a classroom he passed by daily with his mother. He was also interested in Electone music, but was discouraged from learning it by a piano teacher. By the time he began composing at the age of ten, he had learned to play alto saxophone, clarinet, and piano, and was interested in becoming a singer/songwriter. When he was close to graduating from college, he decided to pursue a career in composing music; when he asked a professor for advice, the professor recommended becoming a video game music composer, given the recent success in Japan of Dragon Quest III. During March 1990, after applying to several video game companies including HAL Laboratory, Ito began working at Square.|$|E

5|$|Arnold {{returned}} to {{working on the}} hydrogen bomb book, but 1987 was the 30th anniversary of the Windscale accident. Rather than let {{the records of the}} accident and subsequent inquiries be released over several years, Arnold persuaded the Public Records Office to release them all at once. In meetings with the various responsible government agencies, the topic of a book about Windscale came up, and Arnold decided to write one, which became Windscale 1957: Anatomy of a Nuclear Accident in 1992. Gowing, in poor health, retired from the UKAEA in 1993. By this time her two research assistants had also left, and Arnold feared that the UKAEA Council would shut down the hydrogen bomb book project, which she hoped to follow up with one on the UK civil nuclear power programme. The UKAEA Council decided to press on with the project, asking Arnold to stay on although she was now over seventy years old. In 1993, she was joined by Katherine Pyne, an aircraft engineer working on a history degree, who became her research assistant for two years. However, the end was in sight. The UKAEA no longer had responsibility for nuclear weapons, and management was not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> With funds for the project almost exhausted, the UKAEA Council decided that Arnold should retire in 1996. She loaded her notes into her car and took them home. Sympathetic friends at the Ministry of Defence found some money to cover her expenses, and she doggedly worked on it from home. Britain and the H-Bomb finally appeared in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Aston first gained {{full-time}} employment in 1970, {{working as a}} field officer at the Oxford City and County Museum in Oxfordshire. For a time living in a tent, {{he worked on the}} sites and monuments record and taught several extramural classes while based at the museum. This extramural teaching fitted closely with Aston's staunch belief that archaeology should be open to all who were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> As part of this devotion to public outreach, he presented a radio series on archaeology that was broadcast on Radio Oxford. In 1974 he moved to Taunton to become the first County Archaeologist for Somerset, where he set up a new site record and oversaw the excavation of sites revealed by the construction of the M5 motorway. Again he also taught extramural adult education classes, this time for the University of Bristol. It was here that he developed a passion for aerial archaeology, and would often charter private planes in order to undertake aerial photography. Becoming a pioneer of landscape archaeology, along with Trevor Rowley he was responsible for coining the term in their 1974 book, Landscape Archaeology. With archaeologist James Bond he authored The Landscape of Towns (1976), in which he extended his use of landscape archaeology to urban areas. Recognising his contribution to the discipline, in 1976, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.|$|E

25|$|Tatsuya is {{the main}} male protagonist in the story. He is very {{knowledgeable}} about {{the moon and the}} Kingdom of Sphere because he has been <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> since he was very young. He has this odd unconscious habit of pinching girls on the nose as a sign of affection. Tatsuya constantly finds enjoyment in teasing Natsuki about random things. He is quite loyal toward Feena and her aim to fulfill her mother's dream to reunite the Earth and Moon. Though somewhat apprehensive about the homestay, Tatsuya eventually falls in love with the princess and their union cements the alliance between the two worlds.|$|E
25|$|On 17 May 1902, {{archaeologist}} Valerios Stais {{found that}} one of the pieces of rock had a gear wheel embedded in it. He initially believed that it was an astronomical clock, but most scholars considered the device to be , too complex to have been constructed during the same period as the other pieces that had been discovered. Investigations into the object were dropped until British science historian and Yale University professor Derek J. de Solla Price became <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> in 1951. In 1971, Price and Greek nuclear physicist Charalampos Karakalos made X-ray and gamma-ray images of the 82 fragments. Price published an extensive 70-page paper on their findings in 1974.|$|E

25|$|The {{selection}} for Sedgefield {{did not begin}} until after the 1983 general election was called. Blair's initial inquiries discovered that the left was trying to arrange the {{selection for}} Les Huckfield, sitting MP for Nuneaton who was trying elsewhere; several sitting MPs displaced by boundary changes were also <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> When he discovered the Trimdon branch had not yet made a nomination, Blair visited them and won {{the support of the}} branch secretary John Burton, and with Burton's help was nominated by the branch. At the last minute, he was added to the shortlist and won the selection over Huckfield. It was the last candidate selection made by Labour before the election, and was made after the Labour Party had issued biographies of all its candidates ("Labour's Election Who's Who").|$|E
25|$|The Malaysian {{information}} technology (IT) sector {{is made up}} equally of women and men, {{with large numbers of}} women employed as university professors and in the private sector. This is a product of two historical trends: the predominance of women in the Malay electronics industry, the precursor to the IT industry, and the national push to achieve a ‘pan-Malayan’ culture beyond the three ethnic groups of Indian, Chinese and Malay. Government support for the education of all three groups is available on a quota basis and, since few Malay men are <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>IT,</b> this leaves more room for women. Additionally, families tend to be supportive of their daughters’ entry into this prestigious and highly remunerated industry, in the interests of upward social mobility. Malaysia's push to develop an endogenous research culture should deepen this trend.|$|E

500|$|As {{the name}} says, a {{tracking}} camera follows the characters from behind. The player does {{not control the}} camera in any way - he/she cannot for example rotate it or move it to a different position. This type of camera system was very common in early 3D games such as Crash Bandicoot or Tomb Raider since it is very simple to implement. However, {{there are a number}} of issues with it. In particular, if the current view is not suitable (either because it is occluded by an object, or because it is not showing what the player is <b>interested</b> <b>in),</b> <b>it</b> cannot be changed since the player does not control the camera. Sometimes this viewpoint causes [...] difficulty when a character turns or stands face out against a wall. The camera may jerk or end up in awkward positions.|$|E

500|$|Lutosławski's works {{up until}} and {{including}} the Dance Preludes clearly show the influence of Polish folk music, both harmonically and melodically. Part of his art was in transforming folk music, rather than quoting it exactly. In some cases, folk music is unrecognisable as such without careful analysis, for example, in the Concerto for Orchestra. As Lutosławski developed the techniques of his mature compositions, he stopped using folk material explicitly, although its influence remained as subtle features until the end. As he said, [...] " [...] I could not compose as I wished, so I composed as I was able", and about this change of direction he said, [...] "I was simply not so <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> [...] ". Also, Lutosławski was dissatisfied with composing in a [...] "post-tonal" [...] idiom: while composing the first symphony, he {{felt that this was}} for him a cul-de-sac.|$|E
