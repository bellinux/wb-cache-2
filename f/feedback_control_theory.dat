40|$|While {{regulations}} {{around an}} equilibrium point or a. reference trajectory {{have been the}} focus of recent <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>theories,</b> generation of autonomous oscillations with a specific pattern plays a crucial role in important control applications such as robotics. The central pattern generator (CPG) is the fundamental neuronal mechanism underlying rhythmic movements of animals, and may provide a new paradigm for controlled oscillations of engineering systems. This paper gives a novel method for synthesizing artificial CPG circuits by utilizing the properties of circulant matrices. We show how neuron models can be interconnected to yield a periodic orbit with prescribed frequency, amplitudes, and phases. Using the synthetic CPG in a feedback loop, we propose a control design method for a class of nonlinear rectifier systems to achieve the optimal state pattern with respect to a certain measure of efficiency, subject to small ripples in the rectified variable. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by an application to the gait control of an undulatory snakelike system...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} loop shaping <b>control</b> {{design in}} <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> systems, primarily {{from a practical}} stand point that considers design specifications. Classical <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> design <b>theory,</b> for linear systems where the plant transfer function is known, {{has been around for}} a long time. But it s still a challenge of how to translate the theory into practical and methodical design techniques that simultaneously satisfy a variety of performance requirements such as transient response, stability, and disturbance attenuation while taking into account the capabilities of the plant and its actuation system. This paper briefly addresses some relevant theory, first in layman s terms, so that it becomes easily understood and then it embarks into a practical and systematic design approach incorporating loop shaping design coupled with lead-lag control compensation design. The emphasis is in generating simple but rather powerful design techniques that will allow even designers with a layman s knowledge in controls to develop effective <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> designs...|$|R

With respect to other controllers, the force <b>feedback</b> temperature <b>control</b> strategy is simple to apply {{given that it}} modulates the electrical power input independent of the predetermined tool path and feed rate. The control strategy is implemented by making a series of one-dimensional cuts with a hot wire. The electrical power input to the hot wire is modulated to provide constant tool temperature. Since the cutting force and kerf width are both dependent on the tool temperature, maintaining a constant tool temperature results in consistent cut surface characteristics. The force <b>feedback</b> temperature <b>control</b> <b>theory</b> and its practical implementation in one dimension are presented {{as well as an}} accurate description of the cutting process.
