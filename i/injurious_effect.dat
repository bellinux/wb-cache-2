5|$|The Whig Party {{was also}} divided in Kentucky, not only between Clay and Taylor, but between gubernatorial candidates. William J. Graves, out of {{politics}} since his fatal shooting of Representative Cilley, had the backing of sitting Whig governor William Owsley, while Archibald Dixon had secured support from former Whig governor Robert P. Letcher. Letcher wrote to Crittenden that a Whig split and Democratic victory in the gubernatorial election would have an <b>injurious</b> <b>effect</b> on Whig hopes of carrying Kentucky in the 1848 presidential election; another former Whig governor, Thomas Metcalfe, concurred. At the Whig nominating convention, both Graves and Dixon withdrew their names and a delegate from Logan County put forward Crittenden's name without his consent. The nomination easily carried before Crittenden's friends could block it. The governorship was less prestigious and paid less than Crittenden's position in the Senate. He {{would also have to}} abandon his growing legal practice before the Supreme Court and would lose input on national issues of importance to him such as the territorial questions that grew out of the Mexican War. Nevertheless, he believed that his candidacy would unite the Whigs and help Taylor win Kentucky's electoral votes in the general election. He accepted the nomination a week after it was made.|$|E

500|$|The Supreme Court of the United States has {{identified}} {{a narrow range}} of errors that require automatic reversal; for all other errors, the decision of a lower court will be upheld if the error was harmless. In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled in Chapman v. California that a constitutional error will only be considered harmless when the court is [...] "able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt". Additionally, when reviewing federal habeas corpus petitions, a petitioner must demonstrate that an error [...] "had substantial and <b>injurious</b> <b>effect</b> or influence in determining the jury's verdict". The Supreme Court has also ruled that when reviewing a determination of harmlessness under Chapman, the AEDPA mandates that the reviewing court may not grant a petition for habeas corpus [...] "unless the harmlessness determination itself was unreasonable". According to the Supreme Court, the rationale underlying this doctrine is the public policy concern that states courts should {{not be forced to}} undertake the [...] "arduous task" [...] of retrying criminal defendants [...] "based on mere speculation that the defendant was prejudiced by trial error".|$|E

2500|$|In October 1886, the Society {{received}} strong {{criticism from}} New Zealand. The complaint was that [...] "the society's favours (i.e. the offering of scientific fellowships) {{appear to be}} sown [...]" [...] The complaint was prompted by the following note, sent speculatively from London to likely candidates in the Colonies by the Society."We shall be pleased to add your name {{to the list of}} Fellows of the Society of Science, Letters and Art, of London. We are admitting the principal men of science, letters and art {{from all parts of the}} world. With Sir H.V. Goold's compliments."Auckland Star, 18 October 1886 It was understood that the Society's practice was to send out, along with the above note and the SSLA Journal, a proposal of fellowship already stamped with the acceptance of Goold himself, and with the recipient's name left blank. The Journal stated that in return for an annual subscription of one guinea or a single life membership costing five guineas, 1,000 Foundation Fellowships were not only offered to eminent scientists, but also to anyone merely [...] "engaged in science, literature or art, including music and the fine arts; also to those who are most active in promoting the interests and objects of the society." [...] After the first 1,000 places were filled, an unlimited number of remaining applicants were to be called Ordinary Fellows, and were to pay double the fees. In return for their guineas and for writing their names on the proposal form, members were permitted to append the initials [...] "F.S.Sc." [...] to their names, and to wear gowns and hoods. The conclusion was as follows:"The Society seems, in short, to be founded on the continental system by which the right to use magic letters and titles, usually associated with degrees, can be purchased without examination. Such a system, to our mind, can only have an <b>injurious</b> <b>effect</b> upon true science and art - in the colonies certificates so obtained might be used by unqualified persons to impose upon the public as skilled teachers - and if the Society is earnest in its purposes, and wishes to earn the confidence of the scientific and art world, the sooner it alters its methods the better."Auckland Star, 18 October 1886 In 1892, The Times-Picayune of New Orleans described the Society as [...] "bogus." ...|$|E

The reversal, by {{accident}} or otherwise, of the plates in a battery has an exceedingly <b>injurious</b> <b>effect.</b> It {{is not merely}} the counteraction of the current which the reversed plates can produce, but their effect also in retarding even as indifferent plates, and requiring decomposition to be effected upon their surface, {{in accordance with the}} course of the current, before the latter can pass. They oppose the current, therefore, in the first place, as interposed platina plates would do (1011-1018.); and to this they add a force of opposition as counter-voltaic plates. I find that, in a series of four pairs of zinc and platina plates in dilute sulphuric acid, if one pair be reversed, it very nearly neutralizes the power of the whole.|$|E
