John Flamsteed added Eta, Iota and four Roman letters; of these, only Iota is still used as the others were dropped in {{subsequent}} catalogues and star charts. Flamsteed gave 16 stars Flamsteed designations, of which numbers 1 and 16 are not used—1's coordinates were <b>in</b> <b>error</b> as there was no star present at the location that corresponds to any star in his Catalogus Britannicus; Baily presumed that the coordinates were mistranscribed 32s <b>in</b> <b>error</b> by Flamsteed and in fact referred to 7.4 magnitude HD 10407.

40|$|Grammatical {{error is}} a term used in {{prescriptive}} grammar to understand an instance of faulty, unconventional, or controversial usage such as, misplaced modifier or inappropriate verb tense. The importance {{of this research is}} to make Korean pop community more aware of grammatical error. Moreover, this research is trying to identify the types of error that made by Korean pop communities in Twitter. This research was conducted using qualitative research design. The data was obtained from tweets of 5 Korean pop communities in Twitter from January until May. The instrument that researcher used was document analysis. Furthermore, the study was done by several steps such as searching some tweets of Korean pop communities that have grammatical error, screenshoting tweets that contains grammatical error, and marking the tweets that contains grammatical error. After that, the tweets were analyzed and classified using types of error and validating based on the AzarÂ’s book. Based on the result of the study, the researcher found total 58 types of <b>error</b> <b>in</b> the tweets made by Korean pop communities in Twitter. The types of <b>error</b> found <b>in</b> their tweets are 5 <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> singular-plural, 4 <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> word choice, 3 <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> verb tense, 2 <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> omit a word, 4 <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> add a word, 4 <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> incomplete sentence, 5 <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> spelling, 15 <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> punctuation, 5 <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> capitalization, 3 <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> unclear meaning, 4 <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> run on sentence, and 4 <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> possessive noun...|$|R

A full-sized chevron was discovered on the first tail vertebra of Sue, an extremely robust individual, indicating that this feature could not be used to differentiate the two morphs anyway. As Tyrannosaurus rex specimens have been found from Saskatchewan to New Mexico, differences between individuals may be indicative of geographic variation rather than sexual dimorphism. The differences could also be age-related, with 'robust' individuals being older animals.|$|E
