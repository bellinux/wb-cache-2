40|$|Measurements of the {{differential}} pressures on two navy air-speed nozzles, {{consisting of a}} Zahm type Pitot-Venturi tube and a SQ- 16 two-pronged Pitot-static tube, in a tunnel air stream of fixed speed at various angles of pitch and yaw between 0 degrees and plus or minus 180 degrees. This shows for a range over - 20 degrees to + 20 degrees pitch and yaw, <b>indicated</b> <b>air</b> <b>speeds</b> varying very slightly over 2 per cent for the Zahm type and a maximum of about 5 per cent for the SQ- 16 type from the calibrated speed at 0 degree.

5|$|On 10 August 1959, a B-52 {{crashed in}} the Spruce Swamp at Fremont, New Hampshire. The bomber {{was on a}} routine {{training}} mission from Chicopee, Massachusetts, when its <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> and altimeter failed, which led to more serious malfunctions. The B-52 was attempting to make an emergency landing at Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada, the only landing option not affected by foggy weather conditions. However, it crashed before making the landing. The U.S. Air Force reported {{that it was the}} first B-52 crash where the entire crew survived; the crew parachuted to safety. Debris from the crash covered a quarter-mile of densely wooded swampland.|$|R
50|$|In {{the past}} dive brakes were mostly used on dive bombers, which needed to dive very steeply, but without {{exceeding}} their red line speed, {{in order to}} drop their bombs accurately. The airbrakes or spoilers fitted to gliders often function both as landing aids, to adjust the approach angle, {{and to keep the}} aircraft's speed below its maximum permissible <b>indicated</b> <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> in a vertical dive. Most modern combat aircraft are equipped with air brakes, which perform the same function as dive brakes.|$|R
50|$|An {{autothrottle}} (automatic throttle) {{allows a}} pilot {{to control the}} power setting of an aircraft's engines by specifying a desired flight characteristic, rather than manually controlling the fuel flow. These systems can conserve fuel and extend engine life by metering the precise amount of fuel required to attain a specific target <b>indicated</b> <b>air</b> <b>speed,</b> or the assigned power for different phases of flight. A/T and AFDS (Auto Flight Director Systems) work together to fulfill the whole flight plan and greatly reduce the pilots' work load.|$|R
50|$|A {{fixed-wing}} aircraft {{can be made}} to stall in any pitch attitude or bank angle or at any airspeed but deliberate stalling is commonly practiced by reducing the speed to the unaccelerated stall speed, at a safe altitude. Unaccelerated (1g) stall speed varies on different {{fixed-wing aircraft}} and is represented by colour codes on the <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator.</b> As the plane flies at this speed, the angle of attack must be increased to prevent any loss of altitude or gain in airspeed (which corresponds to the stall angle described above). The pilot will notice the flight controls have become less responsive and may also notice some buffeting, a result of the turbulent air separated from the wing hitting the tail of the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|On February 6, 1996, Alas Nacionales Flight 301 (ALW301 {{operated}} by Birgenair)) was bound for Frankfurt, Germany but crashed shortly after take-off from Puerto Plata Airport in the Dominican Republic into Atlantic Ocean 26 kilometres off-shore. All 176 passengers and 13 crew members, among them 154 Germans and 9 Polish people, were killed. It {{was found that}} one of the <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicators</b> of the Boeing 757-225 was not working properly, confusing the pilots about whether the plane's speed was too fast or too slow.

50|$|The Sala had a plywood covered, ovoid section {{fuselage}} {{with an open}} cockpit immediately {{ahead of}} the wing pedestal. The cockpit lacked a windscreen but was well instrumented for a glider of the day, with <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator,</b> altimeter, turn and bank indicator and variometer. The fuselage tapered rearwards to the tail where the tailplane, with a straight, swept leading edge and carrying elliptically shaped, aerodynamically balanced elevators, was mounted on top. The fin {{was no more than}} a mounting for the tall, curved, balanced rudder, which extended down to the keel and moved in an elevator cut-out. The standard glider ash skid, running from just aft of the nose to below the wing trailing edge and with a single rubber shock absorber served as an undercarriage, assisted by a very small tail skid.|$|R
5000|$|In gauges {{intended}} to sense small pressures or pressure differences, or require that an absolute pressure be measured, the gear train and needle may {{be driven by}} an enclosed and sealed bellows chamber, called an aneroid, which means [...] "without liquid". (Early barometers used a column of liquid such as water or the liquid metal mercury suspended by a vacuum.) This bellows configuration is used in aneroid barometers (barometers with an indicating needle and dial card), altimeters, altitude recording barographs, and the altitude telemetry instruments used in weather balloon radiosondes. These devices use the sealed chamber as a reference pressure and are driven by the external pressure. Other sensitive aircraft instruments such as <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicators</b> and rate of climb indicators (variometers) have connections both to the internal part of the aneroid chamber and to an external enclosing chamber.|$|R

50|$|Any {{number of}} wind {{measurements}} or navigation calculations could {{be carried out}} on the compass face using the wind gauge bar.

The cursor slid along the wind bar, allowing the bomb aimer to measure different airspeeds or times. A small scale on the cursor allowed for the conversion of <b>indicated</b> <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> to true <b>air</b> <b>speed,</b> which differs depending on altitude. A small ring on the right side of the cursor was used to accurately place markings on the compass using the grease pencil.

Rotation occurred at about 114 knots and several seconds after rotation, according to one witness, the aircraft turned and rolled to the left, settling as it did so. The left wingtip subsequently contacted the ground, causing a severe yaw. The forward fuselage struck the ground, causing the flight deck to be destroyed. All four crew aboard were killed.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the last}} week of June 1956, a new maximum-minimum {{airspeed}} indicator was installed in a Boeing B-47 Stratojet to undergo operational suitability testing. [...] "The new instrument, resembling the standard type indicator, differs in that it will determine the stall speed of an aircraft at any specific time. It will also compute the approach speed of the aircraft to aid the pilot in attaining proper speeds for landing. In the past, with the standard type indicator, pilots have had to determine the approach speed of the aircraft through a mental process of totaling the weight of the fuel load and the operating weight of the aircraft to arrive at the gross weight. This was then applied to a chart to determine the proper approach speed of the aircraft. This method, using the standard indicator, left room for error. With the high speed aircraft of today, pilots must be accurate in determining the speed in order to prevent stalling or approaching the landing strip too fast. The new maximum-minimum <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> is designed to prevent errors that might be made by mental calculations of the pilot.

40|$|As {{part of the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Aviation Safety and Security Program, the Tropospheric Airborne Meteorological Data Reporting project (TAMDAR) {{developed}} a low-cost sensor for aircraft flying in the lower troposphere.

This paper reports the TAMDAR sensor performance validation and verification, as flown on board NOAA Lockheed WP- 3 D aircraft. These flight tests were conducted to assess {{the performance of the}} TAMDAR sensor for measurements of temperature, relative humidity, and wind parameters. The ultimate goal was to develop a small low-cost sensor, collect useful meteorological data, downlink the data in near real time, and use the data to improve weather forecasts. The envisioned system will initially be used on regional and package carrier aircraft. The ultimate users of the data are National Centers for Environmental Prediction forecast modelers. Other users include air traffic controllers, flight service stations, and airline weather centers. NASA worked with an industry partner to develop the sensor. Prototype sensors were subjected to numerous tests in ground and flight facilities. As a result of these earlier tests, many design improvements were made to the sensor.
