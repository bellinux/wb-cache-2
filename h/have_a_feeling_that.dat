Bruce Cannon, a sound effects editor for [...] "Thriller", said that, [...] "Things like the lightning {{may have come from}} old Hollywood movies – we'll never know which movies – but the best sound-effects editors do go out in the desert and find a coyote, so I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> was a real howl." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{expected}} that Girls' Generation would achieve success with their electropop music styles following their appearance on US television. Mio Scobie, editor of Us Weekly wrote that [...] "They produce feelgood beats, instantly memorable choruses and, as I'm sure {{people have already}} noticed, they're stunning." [...] McClure's Asia Music News writer Steve McClure also anticipated that the group would succeed on the Western music scene, saying that [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> Girls' Generation will stick round for a while." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2005, Lamason, then 86, recollected {{the events}} of Buchenwald on TV New Zealand. In June 2010, Lamason, then 91, was interviewed again about his {{experience}} at Buchenwald by Mike Dorsey. This and other interviews with Lamason are featured in Dorsey's 2011 documentary film titled, Lost Airmen of Buchenwald, which tells the complete story of the 168 Allied airmen who were sent to Buchenwald, including Lamason. Mike Dorsey said Lamason remained scarred by his experiences {{to the extent that}} Dorsey said “I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> Lamason, to put it in a word, has no time for the Germans.” ...|$|E

500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN [...] "loved" [...] Tom's first {{appearance}} because [...] "It's a great scene and our first introduction to The Others besides Ethan's infiltration of the camp." [...] Gainey found the fan {{reaction to his}} {{first appearance}} [...] "really tough", because [...] "everywhere [...] went people would just give [...] dirty looks and they were like 'What {{are you going to}} do with that boy?'", but he noted this gradually improved after his appearances in season two. Erin Martell from AOL's TV Squad listed Tom in her five [...] "most entertaining guest roles" [...] from the first three seasons, commenting [...] "I am counting his first episode as my favorite. For my money, there was nothing more disturbing than when Gainey showed up out of the blue and uttered the words, 'We're gonna have to take the boy.' I could not get that scene out of my head for days after 'Exodus' aired. Ben has made Tom seem relatively less menacing over time, but I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the terrifying, bearded sea captain is still in there somewhere." [...] In her review of the season four episode [...] "The Other Woman", Nikki Stafford of Wizard called the return of her [...] "favorite Other" [...] (Tom) a [...] "highlight". Following his posthumous flashback appearance in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", Martell said [...] "Now I feel even worse about his death. He wasn't just one of Ben's scary, Walt-napping minions. He had a heart." [...] Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle thought the revelation that Tom is gay was a [...] "unique and funny twist". Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post noted this revelation [...] "seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal (well for an 'Other') not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E

Maybe the connection will come on some late and sweltering summer night, and a teenage kid will be climbing into his car with heartbreak on his mind and nothing left to say.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} in June 2011, Kember revealed that Jason Pierce and himself had not had contact since 1990 or 1991. Kember stated, [...] "Well, I've {{been in touch with}} him, but he's never gotten back in touch with me. I sent my best wishes and stuff, but nothing back. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> isn't going to change, after all this time". He added that although he would be interested in a Spacemen 3 reunion in principle, he thought the realistic chances of it occurring were [...] "zilch".|$|E
2500|$|Farage {{takes an}} anti-prohibitionist {{position}} on recreational drugs. In an April 2014 phone-in interview hosted by The Daily Telegraph {{he argued that}} the War on Drugs had been lost [...] "many, many years ago", stating that [...] "I hate drugs, I've never taken them myself, I hope I never do, but I just <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the criminalisation of all these drugs is actually not really helping British society." [...] He argued in favour of a Royal Commission on drugs exploring all avenues as how to most effectively legislate on drugs and deal with their related criminal and public health problems, including the possibility of their legalisation.|$|E
2500|$|Upon release, Mass Effect: Andromeda {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from video game publications. The game {{was not as}} well received as its predecessors; in his review for Forbes, Paul Tassi wrote, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> Mass Effect fans will enjoy the game, but I don’t think anyone will claim it outclasses the original trilogy, outside of maybe the very first game." [...] Many outlets described the game as a disappointment, with Eurogamer noting that it [...] "launched to mixed reviews and polarised fans". Some critics also described the game as a missed opportunity, such as Joe Juba of Game Informer, who concluded, 'Mass Effect: Andromeda is fun, and the important parts work ... At the same time, I was often left looking through a haze of inconveniences and dreaming about the game it could have been." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> this wasn't in the contract, {{but there}} wasn't {{anything}} to be done. It seemed brutal to leave the poor chap alone with the woman, so I went along.|$|R
60|$|Al {{fought for}} {{steadiness}} {{in the middle}} of the floor. The silence bothered him. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> he was about to begin swaying back and forth. He moistened his lips with his tongue.|$|R
60|$|Wrayson <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{the heat}} was {{becoming}} intolerable. He dared not look at Louise. His eyes were fixed upon the still expressionless face of the woman whose story was slowly unfolding its tragic course.|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked if}} the dynamic between the {{characters}} would continue to progress, de Pablo remarked, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> they're {{going to want to}} play with that [...] a little bit more and see where that goes. I think they're always testing that relationship and they're always throwing things at it to see how far they can take [...] It's already a very complex relationship. They're very close; they're very good friends; and they trust each other. So, I think the complexity of it all can go further and I think they're going to explore more." [...] Pauley Perrette, who portrays series regular Abby Sciuto, openly opposed it and said, [...] "I don't want any of our cast members to be in relationships on screen at all. I like things the way they are, so I'm not in [...] that. I'm petitioning against it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Radke {{discussed}} {{his relationship with}} Escape the Fate members since his departure from the band, stating that {{they have tried to}} reconcile with Radke but he was uninterested in getting back on friendly terms with them after they kicked him out and misinformed their fans about Radke getting caught with heroin inside prison. Radke stated in an interview, [...] "They make a whole album called This War Is Ours, and then they try to say, 'We didn't name that album after you, dude.' Which in fact, they did. I could be wrong; they could be talking about the war on terrorism or something. I don't know. But I just <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> record name was about me. They talk a lot of shit. It is always about forgive and forget, but there's some things that I would like to say. So I did. On the record." ...|$|E
2500|$|The series {{debuted in}} an hour-long format, but {{was put on}} hiatus {{only a few weeks}} into the season. CBS had moved the series to Saturday nights, which led to falling ratings. [...] When The Twilight Zone {{returned}} in December, the episodes were half-hour shows, and generally contained only one story. [...] The series was cancelled by February, with remaining episodes being aired over the summer as hour-long multi-story episodes. [...] Season 2 only ran for 11 episodes; several of the unproduced episodes would be filmed for season 3. In regard to writing for the episode [...] "The Girl I Married", J. M. DeMatteis commented [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the show that appears will not bear much relation to what I wrote. What I've found out is that this season—unlike last, where the script was pretty much regarded as sacrosanct—the network is really interfering a lot. [...] Regardless, I know I did a good job and it was a real satisfying experience." ...|$|E

6000|$|Anne {{could not}} get back her self-control. Her nerves were [...] "all strung up," [...] as she would have said. She <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> she {{was right on the}} brink of a [...] "scene," [...] but she could not help herself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{meant no}} slight to you, Sir,' said Felix, eagerly; 'but {{you know we}} were his first acquaintance, and he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> elder brother came nearest. I am sure he felt no shame; he was {{conscious}} of no change of intention.' ...|$|R
