25|$|As the United States {{developed}} from the 18th century to today, growing more populous and wealthier, factors such as a push for education and desire to share knowledge led to broad public support for free libraries. In addition, money donations by private philanthropists provided the seed capital to <b>get</b> <b>many</b> libraries started. In some instances, collectors donated large book collections.|$|E

25|$|In {{his last}} years Ford was dogged by declining health, largely {{the result of}} decades of heavy {{drinking}} and smoking, and exacerbated by the wounds he suffered during the Battle of Midway. His vision in particular began to deteriorate rapidly {{and at one point}} he briefly lost his sight entirely; his prodigious memory also began to falter, making it necessary to rely more and more on assistants. His work was also restricted by the new regime in Hollywood, and he found it hard to <b>get</b> <b>many</b> projects made. By the 1960s he had been pigeonholed as a Western director and complained that he now found it almost impossible to get backing for projects in other genres.|$|E
25|$|On 6 July, {{experienced}} {{professional and}} vice-captain Massimo Paci also left the club, choosing to join Novara after his contract expired and Parma {{chose not to}} renew it. On the same day, out of favour striker Valeri Bojinov finally made his move to Sporting CP and Chilean attacking midfielder Jaime Valdés moved the other way on a temporary basis. As a result, one of Parma's main aims for the summer of signing of a forward became more important; however, main target Amauri, on loan to Parma {{for the second half}} of the previous year, confirmed his desire to stay at Juventus. Marco Pisano, who had struggled to <b>get</b> <b>many</b> games in his only season as a Parma player behind the more consistent performers Luca Antonelli and Massimo Gobbi at left-back, secured a move to Vicenza on 16 July.|$|E

They spent time recording sounds in a graveyard at night, and also had construction workers drop stone blocks for the sounds of boulders firing and landing in The Return of the King. Mixing took place between August and November at [...] "The Film Mix", before Jackson commissioned the building of a new studio in 2003. The building, however, had not yet been fully completed when they started mixing for The Return of the King.|$|E
500|$|Following the show's {{cancellation}} in 2002, Rogen did not <b>get</b> <b>many</b> auditions, {{which was}} not upsetting {{to him as he}} always thought he would achieve better success as a writer. He would soon be a part of Apatow's [...] "frat pack", a close-knit group that includes Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. Of the awkwardness of a grown man spending so much time with a teenaged Rogen, Apatow said: [...] "I'm such a comedy fan that, even though he's16, I know I'm hanging out with one of the guys who's {{going to be one of}} the great comics." [...] Around this time, Apatow would come up with odd requests for Rogen and Goldberg, such as turn an idea of his into a movie in 10 days and come up with 100 one-page ideas for films. Regarding Apatow's professional effect on Rogen, the actor said in 2009, [...] "Obviously, I can't stress how important Judd's been to my career".|$|E

500|$|Evan Sawdey of PopMatters {{said that}} [...] "Just Dance" [...] is an {{intensely}} catchy single {{and is an}} excellent indicator of what the album was all about. Ben Hogwood of musicOMH praised the song saying, [...] "You won't <b>get</b> <b>many</b> more catchy party odes than the chart topping Just Dance this year, a polished gem set to lodge in your head {{for the next few}} weeks." [...] Freedom lu Lac of The Washington Post described the song to be [...] "filled with mindlessly frothy synth-pop that matches low-grade dance grooves with GaGa's icy, almost disembodied vocals about dancing bliss". Lynn Saxberg from the Ottawa Citizen, while reviewing Gaga's The Fame Ball Tour, called the song a perfect sing-along club anthem. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote that the song resembles the [...] "desperate train wreck you're likely to encounter getting wasted at any dive on the L.E.S. at four in the morning" [...] as is emphasized by the lyrics. Talia Kranes from BBC called the song irresistible and said that [...] "the catchiness of her songs is sure to cement her place in the list of pop idols".|$|E
500|$|Pitchfork Media's Ian Cohen {{was less}} {{receptive}} and {{asserted that the}} record seems like a document of a band disconnected from its musical strengths. Josh Modell of Spin felt that Intimacy sometimes gets [...] "sonically or lyrically precarious", while John Robinson of Uncut commented that [...] "there's an air of slightly hedged bets". Drowned in Sound's Nick Southall claimed that the record is not quite the radical statement Bloc Party set out to achieve, but concluded that it is [...] "definitely {{a little bit of}} invigorating redemption at a time when doubts were beginning to cloud what was, initially, a flawless reputation". In its year-end music review for 2008, Under the Radar stated about the band members, [...] "They are so solid and so confident that it seems inevitable that they will <b>get</b> <b>many</b> chances to slowly drift into more daring lands. But without more risk, they may be destined to make albums like Intimacy – accomplished and intriguing, but not life changing, not classic." [...] The record figured in several publications' end-of-year best album lists for 2008—notably, at number14 by Gigwise, at number36 by Drowned in Sound, and at number49 by NME.|$|E
500|$|In 1883, Middlesex {{refused to}} arrange matches with Lancashire {{due to the}} {{perceived}} unfair bowling of Crossland {{and some of his}} teammates. Nottinghamshire had their own complaints, and protested to the MCC regarding Crossland's residential qualification to play for Lancashire. During the previous season, a letter had been written to Cricket magazine suggesting that Crossland's qualification for Lancashire was invalid, as they claimed that although he was engaged on the Old Trafford ground staff for the summer, he continued to reside in Sutton-in-Ashfield during the winter. Crossland was summoned to Lord's over the matter, but the Lancashire committee refused to send him, stating that he was playing for them that day. The protest was eventually dismissed, though the MCC noted that [...] "it would be of value ... to have the evidence on both sides for future reference." [...] Neutral umpires were introduced in 1883, and there was some concern in Lancashire about whether Crossland would be no-balled during the first match of the year. The match against Derbyshire featured one of the most highly-regarded umpires, Thomas Brownhill from Yorkshire, and Crossland bowled without censure. In June that season, Crossland travelled as part of the Lancashire team to Lord's, to play against the Marylebone Cricket Club. The umpires for the match had been advised to be strict in applying the law on throwing, and it was noted in the press that Crossland had modified his bowling action, and no complaints could be made against it. The Daily News did suggest that [...] "if [...] always bowled as he bowled yesterday there would be no disputes about him—and he would not <b>get</b> <b>many</b> wickets." ...|$|E
