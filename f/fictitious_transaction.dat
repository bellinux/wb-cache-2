In the end, some countermeasures are put forward...|$|E
50|$|Ion Rusu, {{the manager}} of Caravita Co. Business Estate Investments was sentenced to five years of {{imprisonment}} for using the companies to launder funds and commit fraud. Rusu confessed that he made <b>fictitious</b> <b>transactions</b> {{with the intent to}} hide the origin of US$3.12 million stolen from the Moldovan Savings Bank.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{executives}} control much of {{the information}} available to outside investors they have the ability to fabricate the appearance of success—"aggressive accounting, <b>fictitious</b> <b>transactions</b> that inflate sales, whatever it takes"—to increase their compensation. In the words of Fortune magazine, earning per share can [...] "be manipulated in a thousand unholy ways" [...] to inflate stock prices in the short term—a practice made famous by Enron.|$|R
50|$|Prosecutors {{alleged that}} Hirotoshi Honda {{approved}} the transactions, {{although he has}} claimed {{he was also a}} victim and only signed the tax documents prepared by his auditor without knowing about the crime. Prosecutors suspect Mugen hid its income by moving funds to a company named MG Estate under machine lease and other <b>fictitious</b> <b>transactions</b> for three years through to December 2000. Since his arrest in 2003, Hirotoshi Honda had stepped down as the company president.|$|R
50|$|For some time, Lernout & Hauspie was {{dogged by}} rumours of {{financial}} impropriety, and in early 1999 the Wall Street Journal ran allegations in its Heard on the Street column by Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Smithson that earnings had been overstated. Further investigation by WSJ staffer Jesse Eisinger {{led to the}} revelation on 8 August 2000 of a major financial scandal involving <b>fictitious</b> <b>transactions</b> in Korea and improper accounting methodologies elsewhere. In April 2001, founders Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie, as well as former CEO Gaston Bastiaens, were arrested in what {{is considered one of}} the largest corporate scandals in history prior to Enron. Lernout & Hauspie finally went bankrupt on 25 October 2001 after having struggled for a year.|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} {{the extent of the}} role of the Satuan Pengawas Intern (Internal Audit Unit) in detecting and preventing fraud in public universities in West Java under the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education. The research method applied was a qualitative case study approach, while the unit of analysis for this study is the Internal Audit Unit at each public university. Results of this study indicate that the Internal Audit Unit is able to detect and prevent fraud within a public university environment by means of red flags to mark accounting anomalies. These stem from inaccurate budget planning that prompts inappropriate use of funds, exacerbated by late disbursements of funds, which potentially lead to <b>fictitious</b> <b>transactions,</b> and discrepancies in recording state-owned assets into a state property management system (SIMAK BMN), which, if not conducted properly, potentially causes loss to the state...|$|R
50|$|From his {{hiding place}} in Singapore, Vincent {{revealed}} that {{the total amount of}} taxes evaded by 14 oil palm plantation companies under the Asian Agri umbrella or the total losses to the state came to IDR1.3 trillion (around US$115 million), making it the largest tax scandal in Indonesia’s history. This tax evasion was committed during 2002-2005.Three modus operandi of tax evasion used by Asian Agri are creating fictitious expenses, price manipulation through a transfer pricing scheme, and <b>fictitious</b> hedging <b>transactions.</b> These manipulations were then channeled through a number of foreign companies also owned by Sukanto, in places such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Mauritius, Macao and the British Virgin Islands.|$|R
50|$|The tax law of many {{countries}} includes provisions aiming at preventing abuse. Tax authorities try to challenge <b>fictitious</b> or artificial <b>transactions</b> {{and try to}} combat tax evasion. Transactions which are only carried out to receive a tax benefit shall be prevented. Furthermore, transactions whose primary intention is tax allowance should be prohibited. If a transaction is considered as harmful tax avoidance under an anti-avoidance legislation, the tax burden is calculated as if the abuse had not occurred. As tax planning schemes might not work under certain anti-avoidance rules, it is favorable for companies if such legislations do not exist.|$|R
50|$|In {{all three}} modes, the CAP reader asks the EMV card to output a data packet that {{confirms}} {{the cancellation of}} a <b>fictitious</b> EMV payment <b>transaction,</b> which involves the details entered by the user. This confirmation message contains a message authentication code (typically CBC-MAC/Triple DES) that is generated {{with the help of}} a card-specific secret key stored securely in the smartcard. Such cancellation messages pose no security risk to the regular EMV payment application, but can be cryptographically verified and are generated by an EMV card only after the correct PIN has been entered. It provided the CAP designers a way to create strong cryptographic evidence that a PIN-activated EMV card is present and has seen some given input data, without having to add any new software functions to EMV cards already in use.|$|R
