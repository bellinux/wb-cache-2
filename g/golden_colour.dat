5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of choice for everyday use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European countries) {{is a good choice}} for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a <b>golden</b> <b>colour</b> when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E
5|$|Dorset's flag, {{which is}} known as the Dorset Cross or St Wite's Cross, was adopted in 2008 {{following}} a public competition organised by Dorset County Council. The winning design, which features a white cross with a red border on a golden background, attracted 54% of the vote. All three colours are used in Dorset County Council's coat of arms and the red and white was used in recognition of the English flag. The <b>golden</b> <b>colour</b> represents Dorset's sandy beaches and the Dorset landmarks of Golden Cap and Gold Hill. It is also a reference to the Wessex Dragon, a symbol of the Saxon Kingdom which Dorset once belonged to, and the gold wreath featured on the badge of the Dorset Regiment.|$|E

500|$|Elixir is a women's {{fragrance}} by Colombian singer songwriter Shakira, {{developed in}} a collaboration with international fashion company Puig. After the release of her first two fragrances, Puig enlisted several perfumers to work on Shakira's third fragrance, which she claimed would capture her [...] "most sensual and exotic side." [...] The final product was Elixir, an oriental perfume based on various spicy and woody sources. The flacon of the perfume is inspired by apothecary bottles and is made to resemble a magical potion, featuring a light <b>golden</b> <b>colour</b> scheme.|$|E
500|$|The {{iconography}} of Sharabeshwaramurti (Shiva as Sharabha) is specifically defined in texts such as Khamikagama and Sritattvanidhi. In Khamikagama, Sharabha {{is described in}} the form of a bird with <b>golden</b> <b>colour,</b> with two uplifted wings, two red eyes, four legs {{in the form of}} a lion touching the ground, four legs with claws upwards, and with an animal tail. The top part of the body is shown as human but with the face of a lion with an ornamented crown; side tusks are also depicted giving an overall frightening sight. It also shows the Narasimha beneath Sharabha’s legs as a lion-faced human with anjali (hands folded prayer gesture). (See Infobox image) ...|$|E
50|$|Golden Valley {{was named}} in 1878 by pioneer settler and Huron County native Barnard Fagan.

500|$|A cocoon is {{a casing}} spun of silk by many moth caterpillars, and {{numerous}} other holometabolous insect larvae as a protective covering for the pupa. Most Lepidoptera larvae will either make a cocoon and pupate inside them or will pupate in a cell under the ground, {{with the exception of}} butterflies and advanced moths such as noctuids, whose pupae are exposed. The pupae of moths are usually brown and smooth whereas butterfly pupae are often colourful and their shape varies greatly. In butterflies, the exposed pupa {{is often referred to as}} a chrysalis, derived from the Greek term [...] "chrysalis": [...] (...) for gold, referring to the <b>golden</b> <b>colour</b> of some pupae.|$|E

2500|$|The type of malt {{determines the}} colour of the saison, and {{although}} most saisons {{are of a}} cloudy <b>golden</b> <b>colour</b> as result of the grist being mostly pale or pilsner malt, the use of darker malts results in some saisons being reddish-amber. Some recipes also use wheat. Spices such as orange zest, coriander, and ginger may be used. Some spice character may come through due {{to the production of}} esters during fermentation at warm temperatures. Modern examples brewed in the US tend to copy the yeast used by the Dupont Brewery, which ferments better at warmer temperatures like [...] than the standard [...] fermenting temperature used by other Belgian ales.|$|E

It was once found throughout much of northwestern Australia, with even a patch on the New South Wales/South Australia border, but it is now restricted to the Kimberley region of Western Australia, and to Augustus, Barrow and Middle Islands off of Western Australia (I. auratus barrowensis) and Marchinbar Island of Northern Territory.

For a minute perhaps he sat, pen in mouth, admiring the rich <b>golden</b> <b>colour</b> above the crest, and then his attention was attracted by the little figure of a man, inky black, running over the hill-brow towards him. He was a shortish little man, and he wore a high hat, and he was running so fast that his legs verily twinkled.|$|E
60|$|Among the genteel youths of the after-guard was a lad {{of about}} sixteen, a very {{handsome}} young fellow, with starry eyes, curly hair of a <b>golden</b> <b>colour,</b> and a bright, sunshiny complexion: {{he must have}} been the son of some goldsmith. He {{was one of the few}} sailors--not in the main-top--whom I used to single out for occasional conversation. After several friendly interviews he became quite frank, and communicated certain portions of his history. There is some charm in the sea, which induces most persons to be very communicative concerning themselves.|$|E

60|$|It was in {{his eyes}} that I saw the cause of her perturbation. Ordinarily grey and cold and harsh, they were now warm and soft and golden, and all a-dance with tiny lights that dimmed and faded, or welled up till the full orbs were flooded with a glowing radiance. Perhaps it was to this that the <b>golden</b> <b>colour</b> was due; but golden his eyes were, {{enticing}} and masterful, {{at the same time}} luring and compelling, and speaking a demand and clamour of the blood which no woman, much less Maud Brewster, could misunderstand.|$|E
6000|$|The banana, when unripe, {{is white}} and insipid; it is then baked under ashes till it takes a <b>golden</b> <b>colour,</b> and, like a cereal, it can be eaten as bread. A little later it is boiled, and becomes a fair vegetable, tasting {{somewhat}} like chestnuts, and certainly better than carrots or turnips. Lastly, when softer than a pear, it is a fruit eaten with milk or made into beignets. I have described the plantain-cider in [...] "Lake Regions of Central Africa" [...] (ii. 287). The fruit contains sugar, gum, and acids (malic and gallic); the rind, which is easily detached when ripe, stains cloth with ruddy grey rusty colour, by its tannin, gallic, and acetic acids.|$|E
60|$|Her own terror rushed upon me, and in {{that moment}} of fear—the most terrible fear a man can experience—I knew that in inexpressible ways she was dear to me. The {{knowledge}} that I loved her rushed upon me with the terror, and with both emotions gripping at my heart and causing my blood {{at the same time to}} chill and to leap riotously, I felt myself drawn by a power without me and beyond me, and found my eyes returning against my will to gaze into the eyes of Wolf Larsen. But he had recovered himself. The <b>golden</b> <b>colour</b> and the dancing lights were gone. Cold and grey and glittering they were as he bowed brusquely and turned away.|$|E

"Well, then, {{you must}} know," [...] said Pedro, [...] "that in days of old--about {{the time that}} William the Conqueror invaded England--a certain Manco Capac founded the dynasty of the Incas. According to an old legend this Manco {{was the son of}} a white man who was shipwrecked on the coast of Peru. He married the {{daughter}} of an Indian chief, and taught the people agriculture, architecture, and other arts. He must have been a man of great power, from the influence he exerted over the natives, who styled him the `blooming stranger.' His hair was of a <b>golden</b> <b>colour,</b> and this gave rise to the story that he was a child of the sun, who had been sent to rule over the Indians and found an empire. Another tradition says that Manco Capac was accompanied by a wife named Mama Oello Huaco, who taught the Indian women the mysteries of spinning and weaving, while her husband taught the arts of civilisation to the men.|$|E
60|$|The water {{proved to}} be sweet, cool, and every way delicious. This was at least the twentieth spring which had been seen that day, though {{it was the first}} of which the waters had been tasted. This new-born beach had every {{appearance}} of having been exposed to the air a thousand years. The sand was perfectly clean, and of a bright <b>golden</b> <b>colour,</b> and it was well strewed with shells of the most magnificent colours and size. The odour of their late tenants alone proclaimed the fact of their recent shipwreck. This, however, was an evil that a single month would repair; and our sailor determined to make another voyage to this bay, which he called Shell Bay, in order to procure some of its treasures. It was true he could not place them before the delighted eyes of Bridget, but he might arrange them in his cabin, and fancy that she was gazing at their beauties. After drinking at the spring, and supping on the rocks above, Mark arranged a mattress, provided for that purpose, in the boat, and went to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|Lesbia {{was seated}} {{with her two}} daughters on couches placed {{under the shade of}} some trees. Two or three slave girls stood behind them with fans. A {{dalmatian}} bore hound lay on {{the ground in front of}} them. Another slave girl was singing, accompanying herself on an instrument resembling a small harp, while a negro stood near in readiness to start upon errands, or to fetch anything that his mistress might for the moment fancy. Lesbia half rose from her reclining position when she saw Pollio approaching, accompanied by a tall figure with hair of a <b>golden</b> <b>colour</b> clustering closely round his head. The Britons generally wore their hair flowing over their shoulders; but the Iceni had found such inconvenience from this in making their way through the close thickets of the swamps, that many of them--Beric among the number--had cut their hair close to the head. With him it was but a recurrence to a former usage, as while living among the Romans his hair had been cut short in their fashion. The two girls, who were fifteen and sixteen years old, uttered an exclamation of surprise as Beric came near, and Lesbia exclaimed angrily: ...|$|E
25|$|The <b>golden</b> trevally's <b>colour</b> is {{the species}} most {{prominent}} distinguishing feature, {{and for which}} it acquired its common names. Juveniles are a bright <b>golden</b> yellow <b>colour</b> over their entire body and all fins, with 7 to 11 black vertical crossbars all over their body. These bars generally alternate between broad and narrow. The caudal fin lobes have dark tips {{and there is a}} prominent black edge to the operculum. As the fish grows, the body becomes more silver to silvery golden and the cross bars fade or disappear, often replaced by dark blotches. The fins remain yellow, often with greenish tinges. The dark edge of the operculum also fades with age.|$|R

The undercoat is soft and keeps the retriever cool in summer and warm in winter; it sheds {{in the spring and}} fall. It usually lies flat against the belly. The Golden's coat should never be too long, as this may prove to be a disservice to it in the field, especially when retrieving game. Golden Retrievers have mild feathering on the backs of their fore legs and heavier feathering on the fronts of their necks, backs of their thighs and the bottoms of their tails.|$|R
