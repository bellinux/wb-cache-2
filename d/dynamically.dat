5|$|An {{ideal is}} by {{definition}} unattainable in a given time and space. However, by persistently and <b>dynamically</b> approaching it, the process results in a sustainable system.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{focuses on}} forming nucleic acid systems with designed dynamic functionalities {{related to their}} overall structures, such as computation and mechanical motion. There is some overlap between structural and dynamic DNA nanotechnology, as structures can be formed through annealing and then reconfigured <b>dynamically,</b> or {{can be made to}} form <b>dynamically</b> in the first place.|$|E
5|$|One-piece, {{machined}} from a nitrogen-hardened nickel-chrome {{molybdenum steel}} forging. Statically and <b>dynamically</b> balanced. Seven main bearings and six throws.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{since the}} trans-Neptunian region was first charted {{have shown that}} the region now called the Kuiper belt is not the point of origin of short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a linked population called the scattered disc. The scattered disc was created when Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of <b>dynamically</b> stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (the Kuiper belt proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered disc). Because the scattered disc is <b>dynamically</b> active and the Kuiper belt relatively <b>dynamically</b> stable, the scattered disc is now seen as the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.|$|E
5|$|HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) {{developed}} at Facebook and available as open source, it converts PHP code into a high-level bytecode (commonly {{known as an}} intermediate language), which is then translated into x86-64 machine code <b>dynamically</b> at runtime by a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, resulting in up to 6× performance improvements.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 DragonFly BSD {{received}} a new device file system (devfs), which <b>dynamically</b> adds and removes device nodes, allows accessing devices by connection paths, recognises drives by serial numbers and removes {{the need for}} pre-populated /dev file system hierarchy. It was implemented as a Google Summer of Code 2009 project.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium {{is a key}} {{constituent}} of high performing {{mixed oxide}} catalysts for the heterogeneous catalytic selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid. The surface elemental composition changes <b>dynamically</b> and reversibly with the reaction conditions. In the presence of steam {{the surface of the}} catalyst is enriched in tellurium and vanadium which translates into the enhancement of the acrylic acid production.|$|E
5|$|The {{durability}} and life of <b>dynamically</b> loaded, welded steel structures is determined {{in many cases}} by the welds, in particular the weld transitions. Through selective treatment of the transitions by grinding (abrasive cutting), shot peening, High Frequency Impact Treatment, etc. the durability of many designs increase significantly.|$|E
5|$|The regular-season {{schedule}} was not fixed but was created <b>dynamically</b> by each team {{as the season}} progressed. The following table was formed by NFL History, which used contemporary newspapers. The first game involving an APFA team occurred on September 26, when the Rock Island Independents beat the St. Paul Ideals 48–0.|$|E
5|$|The vulcanoids are a {{hypothetical}} population of asteroids that orbit the Sun in a <b>dynamically</b> stable zone inside {{the orbit of}} the planet Mercury. They are named after the hypothetical planet Vulcan, whose existence was disproven in 1915. So far, no vulcanoids have been discovered, {{and it is not}} yet clear if any exist.|$|E
5|$|DragonFly BSD {{supports}} Amiga-style resident applications feature: {{it takes}} a snapshot of a large, <b>dynamically</b> linked program's virtual memory space after loading, allowing future instances of the program to start {{much more quickly than}} it otherwise would have. This replaces the prelinking capability that was being worked on earlier in the project's history, as the resident support is much more efficient. Large programs like those found in KDE Software Compilation with many shared libraries will benefit the most from this support.|$|E
5|$|Galaxies have {{magnetic}} fields of their own. They {{are strong enough}} to be <b>dynamically</b> important: they drive mass inflow into the centers of galaxies, they modify the formation of spiral arms and they can affect the rotation of gas in the outer regions of galaxies. Magnetic fields provide the transport of angular momentum required for the collapse of gas clouds and hence the formation of new stars.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the clustering of the perihelia and the orbital poles of distant objects, Planet Nine offers explanations for the high perihelion of Sedna and , for objects with orbits roughly perpendicular {{to those of the}} planets, for high inclination TNOs with semi-major axes less than 100 AU, and for the tilt of the Sun's rotation axis. The objects it <b>dynamically</b> controls would form a cloud centered on its semi-major axis {{with a wide range of}} inclinations.|$|E
5|$|Just one sound can be {{complete}} in itself, for its complexity {{lies in the}} formulation of ma, an unquantifiable metaphysical space (duration) of <b>dynamically</b> tensed absence of sound. For example, in the performance of nō, the ma of sound and silence does not have an organic relation for the purpose of artistic expression. Rather, these two elements contrast sharply with one another in an immaterial balance.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2014, Team Meat {{announced}} that a sequel, Super Meat Boy: Forever, was in development for smartphones, tablets, and Steam. Forever is styled as an endless runner, though the player has additional abilities, such as combat controls, to complete levels. Levels themselves are <b>dynamically</b> built based on the difficulty level, and get progressively more difficult as the player completes them. The game was confirmed for release in 2018 on Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS and Android systems in August 2017.|$|E
5|$|Python uses duck typing and has {{typed objects}} but untyped {{variable}} names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object {{is not of}} a suitable type. Despite being <b>dynamically</b> typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting {{to make sense of}} them.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem was}} further {{addressed}} in 2014 when Greyhound rolled {{out a new}} yield management computer system. With the new system, Greyhound is now able to more closely manage the number of tickets sold for each departure and <b>dynamically</b> adjust pricing based on sales. Although the amount of overbooked buses has been sharply reduced with this new system, Greyhound still does not explicitly guarantee a seat to everyone with a ticket (except on Greyhound Express routes).|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{co-operative}} multiplayer mode, {{in which}} two players team up to accomplish various challenges and fight against waves of increasingly difficult enemies in the Roman Colosseum, a gladiator arena setting. The environments of the Colosseum change <b>dynamically</b> in a match to add variety to the mode. Players can gain access to increasingly advanced armor and weapons as they progress through these multiplayer matches. Microtransactions are also featured, allowing players to purchase in-game upgrades with real-life currency.|$|E
5|$|These bus power {{currents}} being {{much higher}} than cables were designed for, though not unsafe, cause a larger voltage between {{the ends of the}} ground signal, significantly reducing noise margins causing problems with High Speed signaling. Battery Charging Specification 1.1 specifies that charging devices must <b>dynamically</b> limit bus power current draw during High Speed signaling; 1.2 simply specifies that charging devices and ports must be designed to tolerate the higher ground voltage difference in High Speed signaling.|$|E
5|$|With unarticulated wheels, {{climbing}} obstacles {{will cause}} {{the body of a}} vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle will become statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become <b>dynamically</b> unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, dynamic typing {{may allow}} compilers to run faster and interpreters to <b>dynamically</b> load new code, because changes to source code in <b>dynamically</b> typed {{languages}} {{may result in}} less checking to perform and less code to revisit. This too may reduce the edit-compile-test-debug cycle.|$|E
25|$|Octave is {{extensible}} using <b>dynamically</b> loadable modules.|$|E
25|$|SPI {{does not}} support hot {{swapping}} (<b>dynamically</b> adding nodes).|$|E
25|$|<b>Dynamically</b> {{networked}} organisations: Make {{knowledge as}} available as possible within the organisation.|$|E
25|$|Most {{operating}} systems that support <b>dynamically</b> linked libraries also support <b>dynamically</b> loading such libraries via a run-time linker API. For instance, Microsoft Windows uses the API functions LoadLibrary, LoadLibraryEx, FreeLibrary and GetProcAddress with Microsoft Dynamic Link Libraries; POSIX based systems, including most UNIX and UNIX-like systems, use dlopen, dlclose and dlsym. Some development systems automate this process.|$|E
25|$|This two-degree-of-freedom {{system does}} not display a {{quasi-static}} buckling, but becomes <b>dynamically</b> unstable.|$|E
25|$|See Rossby waves as {{an example}} of when changes of {{latitude}} are <b>dynamically</b> effective.|$|E
25|$|Word count {{listed by}} default {{in the status}} bar. The word count <b>dynamically</b> updates as you type.|$|E
25|$|In Google Slides, Explore <b>dynamically</b> generates design {{suggestions}} {{based on}} the contents of each slide.|$|E
25|$|Immanence—That {{although}} God is transcendent and holy, He is also {{accessible and}} can be <b>dynamically</b> experienced.|$|E
25|$|Systems using {{cooperative}} {{agents that}} <b>dynamically</b> examine and identify vulnerability chains, creating attack trees, {{have been built}} since 2000.|$|E
25|$|Functional {{quality is}} {{typically}} assessed <b>dynamically</b> {{but it is}} also possible to use static tests (such as software reviews).|$|E
25|$|CP/M3, however, {{added support}} for <b>dynamically</b> loadable Resident System Extensions (RSX), and similar {{solutions}} (like RSM) were also retrofitted to CP/M 2.2 systems by third-parties.|$|E
25|$|In {{broadcast}} multiple-access networks, neighbor adjacency {{is formed}} <b>dynamically</b> using multicast hello packets to 224.0.0.5. A DR and BDR are elected normally, and function normally.|$|E
25|$|Adaptive optics, {{especially}} wavefront-coding spatial light modulators, {{are frequently}} used in optical trapping applications to multiplex and <b>dynamically</b> reconfigure laser foci {{that are used}} to micro-manipulate biological specimens.|$|E
25|$|The Carme group shares {{an average}} {{inclination}} of 165°. It is <b>dynamically</b> tight (5 < Δv < 50nbsp&m/s). It is very homogenous in colour, each member displaying light red colouring {{consistent with a}} D-type asteroid progenitor.|$|E
