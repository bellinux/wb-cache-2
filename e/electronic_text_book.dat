40|$|This semi-experimental study aims {{to examine}} the impact of a {{learning}} environment that uses interactive electronic textbook on the affective learning of prospective mathematics teachers. The study group consisted of 64 prospective teachers attending the Mathematics Teaching program at Karadeniz Technical University, Turkey. For 14 weeks, experimental group received the Development and Learning course in a blended learning environment, in which an interactive e-textbook was used inside and outside the classroom. In this period, only face to face education was conducted with the control group in the classroom environment. A course attitude scale and a blended learning environment satisfaction scale were employed for the purpose of data collection. In addition, observations were conducted with both of the groups during the application. The analysis of the findings indicated that there was a significant increase between pre- and post-course attitude scores of experimental group students, the students were satisfied with the learning environment formed, and the <b>electronic</b> <b>text</b> <b>book</b> increased interest in the course.

40|$|Students are {{becoming}} accustomed {{to using the}} Internet as an information source that supplements or replaces the normal institutional and classroom handout. However, the use of full electronic books through the Internet or CD instead of a printed full <b>text</b> <b>book</b> is a uniquely different experience, not only for these students but also for academics and their institutions. This study describes the initiative of constructing, publishing, prescribing and using an online <b>text</b> <b>book</b> for use by students in a postgraduate accounting course at an Australian university. The experience provides valuable insights that {{suggest the need for}} changes to hardware and software facilities in homes, offices and learning institutions, to students' expectations, and to purchase interfaces and <b>text</b> display, before <b>electronic</b> <b>text</b> <b>books</b> can be readily accepted as an alternative learning tool. It is encouraging from the accounting students' feedback that there was no strong evidence of rejection of the e-book as a learning tool, despite the current technological difficulties associated with its use.

40|$|Thesis (LLM) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Even though {{numerous}} {{individuals have}} been sentenced for committing {{some of the}} most heinous crimes known to mankind, there still does not exist clear guidelines as to the process which should be followed by courts that {{are in the process of}} determining an appropriate sentence for individuals guilty of committing international crimes. The aim of this study was to establish how South African courts should approach the sentencing of individuals guilty of committing international crimes as South Africa has not as yet had to sentence an individual guilty of committing an international crime. It is, however, significantly clear that South African courts must follow Section 51 of the Implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act 27 of 2002 and impose a sentence of imprisonment for life except if substantial and compelling circumstance exist which justifies a departure from this standard. In the establishment of substantial and compelling circumstances the South African courts will definitely revert to the jurisprudence of the international criminal courts and tribunals and that of South African criminal courts as well. This study is comprised of a literature review consisting of international legal instruments, legislation, <b>electronic</b> sources, <b>text</b> <b>books,</b> academic journals and South African, as well as international case law.

40|$|The {{creation}} of my hypermedia work Index of Love, which narrates {{a love story}} as an archive of moments, images and objects recollected, also articulated for me {{the potential of the}} <b>book</b> as <b>electronic</b> <b>text.</b> The <b>book</b> has always existed as both narrative and archive. Tables of contents and indexes allow the book to function simultaneously as linear narrative and non-linear, searchable database. The book therefore has more in common with the so-called 'new media' of the 21 st century than it does with the dominant 20 th century media of film, video and audiotape, whose logic and mode of distribution are resolutely linear. My thesis is that the non-linear logic of new media brings to the fore an aspect of the book - the index - whose potential for the production of narrative is only just beginning to be explored. When a reader/user accesses an electronic work, such as a website, via its menu, they simultaneously experience it as narrative and archive. The narrative journey taken is created through the menu choices made. Within the electronic book, therefore, the index (or menu) has the potential to function as more than just an analytical or navigational tool. It has the potential to become a creative, structuring device. This opens up new possibilities for the book, particularly as, in its paper based form, the book indexes factual work, but not fiction. In the electronic book, however, the index offers as rich a potential for fictional narratives as it does for factual volumes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR...|$|R
40|$|THISSTUDY DRAWS UPON THFORIFS from {{cognitive}} anthropology {{concerning the}} role that metaphors and mental scripts play in organizing human thought and action. Metaphors are implicit cognitive templates that enable people to understand novel situations in terms of familiar ones, while the related scripts provide outlines for how to act in emergent situations. These theories are applied {{to the ways in}} which librarians and library patrons conceptualize and respond to <b>electronic</b> <b>texts.</b> In 1994, these authors carried out a qualitative ethnographically informed case study of an <b>electronic</b> <b>text</b> center in a large academic library designed to reveal the underlying metaphors that library staff and patrons used in thinking about <b>electronic</b> <b>texts.</b> This article presents three of the most common sets of these metaphors. The first was a tendency to analogize <b>electronic</b> full <b>texts</b> as regular <b>books.</b> Second, a large body of competing metaphors saw the <b>electronic</b> <b>text</b> center as both a place of play and a place for work.

40|$|Unsettling Whiteness brings {{together}} an international collection that considers anew the politics, practices and representations of whiteness {{at a time}} when nations worldwide continue to grapple with issues that are underwritten by whiteness. It draws together case studies of the performance of whiteness from significantly different political and social contexts with shared purpose; to investigate (re) constructions of whiteness, to explore the mechanisms which give whiteness power (and make power itself whitened), and to dissect the social processes through which whiteness is made visible and invisible. The collection makes a significant contribution to contemporary debates on whiteness by unsettling historical definitions and examining artistic, intimate and institutional attempts to reinforce or dismantle white norms and privileges. The case studies and analyses offer insightful reading on their own, but together offer a unique transdisciplinary approach to the complex task of exposing, resisting and subverting racialised domination across social relations today. <b>Electronic</b> <b>book</b> <b>text</b> | 296 pages ISBN 978 - 1 - 84888 - 282 -...|$|R

30|$|Authorship {{analysis}} {{is useful in}} any application context where authorship attribution is uncertain, unknown, or otherwise obfuscated. Such occurrences often arise in disciplines such as history and criminology. Traditionally, authorship analysis has been performed through manual analysis. However, manual analysis has become increasingly difficult with growing usage of <b>electronic</b> <b>text</b> (e.g. e-mail, websites) and social media (e.g. forums, blogs). Problems with manual analysis arise when processing large volumes of text content or adapting traditional stylometric analysis (e.g. handwriting style) to <b>electronic</b> <b>text.</b> As a result, researchers have become interested in developing techniques to conduct automated authorship analysis on <b>electronic</b> <b>text</b> across various languages. By borrowing perspectives and techniques from computational linguistics, many traditional features used to evaluate authorship have been operationalized for use with <b>electronic</b> <b>texts.</b>|$|R
