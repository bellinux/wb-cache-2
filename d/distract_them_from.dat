5|$|For Catherine, these {{entertainments}} {{served a}} political purpose {{that made them}} worth their colossal expense. She presided over the royal government {{at a time when}} the French monarchy was in steep decline. With three of her sons on the throne in succession and the country torn by religious civil war, Catherine set out to show not only the French people but foreign courts that the Valois monarchy was as prestigious and magnificent as it had been during the reigns of Francis I and her husband Henry II. At the same time, she believed these elaborate entertainments and sumptuous court rituals, which incorporated martial sports and tournaments of many kinds, would occupy her feuding nobles and <b>distract</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> fighting against each other to the detriment of the country and the royal authority.|$|E
5|$|On the British side, General Clinton {{learned of}} the almost undefended Jamaica Pass from local Loyalists. He drew up a plan {{and gave it to}} William Erskine to propose to Howe. Clinton's plan had the main army making a night march and going through the Jamaica Pass to turn the American flank, while other troops would keep the Americans busy in front. On August 26, Clinton {{received}} word from Howe that the plan would be used, and that Clinton was to command the advance guard of the main army of 10,000 men on the march through the Jamaica Pass. While they made the night march, General James Grant's British troops along with some Hessians, a total of 4,000 men, were to attack the Americans in front to <b>distract</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the main army coming on their flank. Howe told Clinton to be ready to move out that night, August 26.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to <b>distract</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{organization}} of the association the major literary associations were the Union of Proletarian Writers Hart and the Union of Peasant Writers Pluh.

5|$|Israeli Arab {{historian}} Mustafa Kabha {{wrote that}} Egyptian and other Arab historians did not attribute as much {{importance to the}} battle as Israeli ones. They ask what the Egyptian objective was, {{and whether or not}} it was wise to advance without securing their lines of communication. Abdullah el Tell, commander of the Jordanian Legion in Jerusalem, thought that the Egyptians did not consider the Legion's needs. Aware of their weaknesses, they did not let anything <b>distract</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> reaching Tel Aviv. The Egyptian war log, from 19:00 on May 28, 1948, showed concern over the lines of communication. Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari wrote that while the Egyptians publicly declared that the target was Tel Aviv, they never actually meant to advance farther than their Isdud fortifications. As evidence, he cited the Egyptian refusal to take the undefended Yibna despite the villagers' repeated cries for help. Bahjat Abu-Gharbiyeh, one of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni's deputies and commander of the Beit Jibrin area, wrote that the Egyptians never had a clear plan, because their leadership were not really interested in a war. Therefore, their efforts were improvised. Kabha concludes that Arab historiography considers the battle the successful realization of a tactical move, designed to serve the actions of the badly coordinated Arab armies.|$|E
25|$|Yule's {{force had}} to make an {{exhausting}} four-day march across the Biggarsberg hills before they could rejoin White in Ladysmith. On 24 October, White made a demonstration at Rietfontein against the Boers pressing forward down the railway line from Glencoe to Ladysmith, to <b>distract</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> attacking Yule. The British suffered 132 casualties, mainly from artillery fire.|$|E
500|$|Of the 120 {{men that}} landed at Yellow I, 37 were killed, 81 were captured, mostly {{after having been}} wounded, and just one managed to evade capture and return to Britain. Among those that were killed was Lieutenant Edward Loustalot, a United States Army Ranger, {{who was the first}} American soldier to be killed in the European theatre of operations. The smaller party, under Young, however, fared better and managed to advance within [...] of the battery, however, due to lack of numbers they were unable to launch an assault on the battery and instead {{proceeded}} to harass the gunners for a number of hours and <b>distract</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> their purpose of firing on the anchorage before they were forced to withdraw. They succeeded, albeit briefly, to divert the guns from their task of firing on the ships off the coast.|$|E

50|$|Altunin {{received}} the title Hero of the Soviet Union in 1944, having organized the established of a foothold across the Vistula during the Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive and led his men in tenaciously fighting off the German counterattack while <b>distracting</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the Soviet troops' main landing point.|$|R
500|$|Overall as a heavy cavalry commander, Nansouty {{was one of}} {{the best}} men {{available}} during the Napoleonic Wars. Precise, methodical, with perfect knowledge of cavalry tactics, he was better than any other in preparing his attack dispositions. He was however less daring than the likes of Lasalle, Montbrun or Kellermann, which did not prevent him from leading some of the most memorable cavalry charges of the Napoleonic Wars. It has also been said that he reacted with [...] "calculated slowness" [...] when placed under the command of Murat. His talents for up-keeping and training his troops seemed to surpass that of his peers. This was illustrated right from the start of the Napoleonic Wars, with the organisation of the cavalry reserve in the Grande Armée, under Marshal Murat. The command of the various units of this reserve was given to some of the best cavalry commanders available, including Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul, Louis Klein, Marc Antoine de Beaumont, Frédéric Henri Walther, Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers and Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud. Despite the fame and quality of these commanders, it was Nansouty's six-regiment division that acquired the reputation of being the best serviced and most exact in its manoeuvres. He was also a commander who had his men continually manoeuvre during a battle, believing that this would <b>distract</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the danger that they were facing.|$|E
2500|$|Davis {{showed little}} {{interest}} in the film Now, Voyager (1942) until Hal Wallis advised her that female audiences needed romantic dramas to <b>distract</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the reality of their lives. It became one of the best known of her [...] "women's pictures". In one of the film's most imitated scenes, Paul Henreid lights two cigarettes as he stares into Davis' eyes and passes one to her. Film reviewers complimented Davis on her performance, the National Board of Review commenting that she gave the film [...] "a dignity not fully warranted by the script." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thomas's {{plan was}} to launch a diversionary attack on the Confederate right that would <b>distract</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the main attack on their left and perhaps cause them to divert troops from their left to their right. The attacking force {{consisted}} of two brigades drawn from Steedman's Provisional Division: the First Colored Brigade, consisting of three regiments of United States Colored Troops (who had previously served as garrison troops or railroad guards), and a brigade composed of rear echelon white troops described by their commander as [...] "new conscripts, convalescents, and bounty jumpers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late March 2006, Vivendi gave pre-alpha builds of the PlayStation 2 {{version of}} the game to both IGN and GameSpot. They {{explained}} that since E3 2005, Radical had given the entire game an overhaul, improving the design and creating a more compelling storyline. They had also tweaked the gameplay {{in an effort to}} appeal to both casual gamers and more hardcore gamers. These changes had been implemented after some negative feedback from both the public and the gaming press following the E3 demo. Writers had been especially critical of the look of the game, and one of Radical's alterations was to repaint every external texture. Jason Bone stated the negative feedback was a good thing, as Radical had underestimated the difficulty of making a large open world game; [...] "We do have a bit of experience with open world games, but they were on a much smaller scale - there wasn't a lot of detail in them. With this game, we needed it to feel cinematic and yet be an open world game." [...] The negative feedback made them realize the game needed more work. Bone also stated work had not begun on the Xbox 360 version, as they didn't want it to be a direct port, nor did they want it to <b>distract</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the PS2, PC and Xbox versions. He also suggested that a PlayStation 3 version was under consideration.|$|E

50|$|Like pheromones (communication {{chemicals}} used within a species), kairomones can be utilized as an 'attracticide' to lure a pest species to a location containing pesticide. However, {{they might also}} be used to lure desired species. Kairomones produced by the hosts of parasitic wasps have been used in an attempt to attract them and keep them around in crops where they reduce herbivory, but this could instead result in fewer attacks on the herbivous pest if the applied kairomone <b>distracts</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> finding real hosts.|$|R
