5|$|Militarily, it is {{difficult}} to draw many lessons from Salamis, because of the uncertainty about what actually happened. Once again the Allies chose their ground well in order to negate Persian numbers, but this time (unlike Thermopylae) <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on the Persians launching an unnecessary attack for their position to count. (Hale, John R.).|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} so much Belgian gold had been rescued before the German {{occupation}} allowed the Belgian government in exile to finance its own operations, unlike most other exiled governments which <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on British financial support.|$|E
5|$|Andretti {{found little}} success after 1978 in Formula One– {{he failed to}} win another grand prix. He had a {{difficult}} year in 1979, as the new Lotus 80 was not competitive, and the team <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on the Lotus 79 which had been overtaken by the second generation of ground effect cars. In 1980, he was paired with the young Italian Elio de Angelis, and briefly with test driver Nigel Mansell, but the team was again unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|As Buxton's trade {{fell into}} decline {{he tried to}} survive by working as a botanical {{collector}} and delivering newspapers, but eventually <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on a fund set up by Binney for ‘the relief and encouragement of scientific men in humble life’. This situation was compounded when the proceeds from the second edition of his book, published in 1859, were less than anticipated because of competition from Grindon's Manchester Flora published in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Construction in Norway {{has always}} been {{characterized}} {{by the need to}} shelter people, animals, and property from harsh weather, including predictably cold winters and frost, heavy precipitation in certain areas, wind and storms; and {{to make the most of}} scarce building resources. Until modern times, transportation infrastructure was also primitive, and builders largely <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on locally available materials.|$|E
5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the udema carried 14 to 18 {{pairs of}} oars. Rowers {{sat on the}} weather deck {{on either side of}} the main armament with the oar ports placed on a rectangular outrigger which improved their leverage. However, they were positioned {{on either side of the}} centerline battery and could not row under fire; in action, the udema <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on its sails for propulsion.|$|E

5|$|On 26 May, while {{rounding}} {{the southern tip}} of Africa, Arniston separated from the convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged. Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> instead on older, less accurate navigation methods. Navigation via dead reckoning proved particularly difficult as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that prevented a fix being obtained for several days via celestial navigation.|$|E
5|$|Severus Alexander {{held him}} in high esteem {{and made him}} his consul again. His Roman History spans nearly a millennium, from the arrival of Aeneas in Italy until the year 229. As a {{contemporary}} of Elagabalus, Cassius Dio's account of his reign is generally considered more reliable than the Augustan History, although {{by his own admission}} Dio spent the greater part of the relevant period outside of Rome and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on second-hand information.|$|E
5|$|The French {{primarily}} {{viewed the}} colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw cotton; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on {{the dregs of}} the French civil service. Only the Sara of the south was governed effectively; French presence in the Islamic north and east was nominal. The educational system was affected by this neglect.|$|E

5|$|After {{capturing}} Fort Duperre, the commandos received {{reports that}} a force of some 2,000 Zouaves were moving up to recapture the position. The French attack did not eventuate, however, {{and in the end}} the commandos marched all the way to Maison Blanche. Having only been issued with rations for a day, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on fruit and bread that they obtained by bartering with the locals on the way. Eventually they arrived at the port, where they embarked upon the destroyers HMS Wheatland and Lammerton and in company with a force of US Rangers they set out to capture the airfields at Allerlick and Duzzerville, near Bone.|$|E
5|$|Hill and Cape {{appealed to}} the London Court of Quarter Sessions. The prosecutor, Attorney General Sir Thomas Inskip, {{solicited}} testimony from biological and medical experts and from the writer Rudyard Kipling. But when Kipling appeared {{on the morning of}} the trial, Inskip told him he would not be needed. James Melville had wired the defence witnesses the night before to tell them not to come in. The panel of twelve magistrates who heard the appeal <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on passages Inskip read to them for knowledge of the book, since the Director of Public Prosecutions had refused to release copies for them to read. After deliberating for only five minutes, they upheld Biron's decision.|$|E
5|$|More than 300 {{hours of}} footage was {{recorded}} by {{the students and the}} two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting the tapes out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody to leave their homes or the country.|$|E

5|$|Scholar-officials {{who entered}} civil service through {{examinations}} acted as executive officials {{to a much}} larger body of non-ranked personnel called lesser functionaries. They outnumbered officials by four to one; Charles Hucker estimates that they were {{perhaps as many as}} 100,000 throughout the empire. These lesser functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies. Yet they {{should not be confused with}} lowly lictors, runners, and bearers; lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank. The one great advantage of the lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on the good service and cooperation of the local lesser functionaries.|$|E
5|$|Task Force Kean {{kicked off}} its attack on 7 August, moving out from Masan. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade surged forward to Pansong, quickly inflicting 350 {{casualties}} on the North Koreans as it overran the North Korean 6th Division's headquarters. The other {{units of the}} Task Force, however, were slowed by North Korean resistance. Task Force Kean pressed on the Chindong-ni area, resulting in a confused battle where the fragmented force <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on air strikes and airdrops to keep it effective. Task Force Kean's offensive had collided with one being delivered simultaneously by the North Korean 6th Division.|$|E
5|$|Task Force Kean {{kicked off}} its attack on August 7, moving out from Masan. At the Notch, a {{northern}} {{pass into the}} city and site of a previous battle, the 35th Infantry Regiment encountered 500 North Korean infantry, defeating them. The force surged forward to Pansong, inflicting another 350 casualties on the North Koreans. There, they overran the North Korean 6th Division's headquarters. However {{the rest of the}} task force was slowed by North Korean resistance.

5|$|The North Korean People's Army {{forces were}} {{organized}} into a mechanized combined arms force of ten divisions, originally numbering some 90,000 well-trained and well-equipped troops in July, {{with hundreds of}} T-34 Tanks. However, defensive actions by U.S. and South Korean forces had delayed the North Koreans significantly in their invasion of South Korea, costing them 58,000 of their troops {{and a large number}} of tanks. In order to recoup these losses, the North Koreans <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on less experienced replacements and conscripts, many of whom had been taken from the conquered regions of South Korea.|$|E

5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies were {{selected}} to represent the Coastal Division by virtue of a tie-breaking head-to-head victory against division rival Georgia Tech and came into the game with an 8–4 record (5–3 in ACC play). Representing the Atlantic Division was Boston College, which had a 9–3 record (5–3 ACC). The two teams were the victors of a closely contested season in the ACC.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the new perspective, SFS also addresses some commonly raised limitations of other distributed file systems. For example, NFS and SMB clients <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on the server for file system security policies, and NFS servers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on the client computer for authentication. This often complicates security, as one compromised computer could breach {{the security of the}} entire organization. The NFS and SMB protocols also do not by themselves provide confidentiality (encryption) or tamper resistance from other computers on the network, without encapsulation layers such as IPsec.|$|R
