5|$|The goddess {{carries her}} own severed head– {{sometimes}} {{on a platter}} or in a skull-bowl– in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> Though no legend mentions a specific weapon for the beheading, she holds a scimitar, a knife or a scissor-like object in her right hand. Though generally depicted with two arms, manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist. While her own severed head and the sword appear in two of her hands, the implements in the remaining arms vary: a scissor-like object, a skull-bowl collecting the dripping blood from her head or blood stream from her neck, or a severed head, sometimes identified {{as that of the}} god Brahma.|$|E
5|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{monument}} depicts the theme {{of a young man}} called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory.

5|$|In 1897, Victoria {{had written}} {{instructions}} for her funeral, {{which was to}} be military as befitting a soldier's daughter {{and the head of the}} army, and white instead of black. On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, helped lift her body into the coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers.

25|$|By 1962, {{she begins}} using bright colors and allude to floral and plant-like shapes. These works are compositionally similar to her {{monochrome}} images {{due to their}} large size and rhythmic nature with no central focal point. The palette of these images often contrast one another and allude to tropical landscapes or plants. She continued working in this style until she suffered an aneurysm, fell, and broke her right wrist in 1963, the wrist she used to paint with. Since she still wanted to work, she painted with <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> instead. To overcome working with her non-dominant hand, she often would directly apply paint from a tube to the canvas rather than using a brush, causing there to be large patches of white canvas on the surfaces of the images. The gesture and the physicality of these works is more restrained since she is working with <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

25|$|Danseuse is a plaster {{sculpture}} {{carved in}} a vertical format. The work represents a woman standing or dancing nude with a folded fan in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and her right knee leaning on a vase. The sculpture, known {{from an early}} photograph, is executed in a highly Cubist syntax, {{in opposition to the}} softness and curvilinearity of Nabis, Symbolist or Art Nouveau forms.|$|E
25|$|Cassiopeia {{has been}} {{variously}} portrayed throughout her {{history as a}} constellation. In Persia, she was drawn by al-Sufi as a queen holding a staff with a crescent moon in her right hand, wearing a crown, {{as well as a}} two-humped camel. In France, she was portrayed as having a marble throne and a palm leaf in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> holding her robe in her right hand. This depiction is from Augustin Royer's 1679 atlas.|$|E
25|$|Dressed {{in black}} and set against a muted green background, the sisters are seen in a doorway. Bessie stands in front, her arms down and hands clasped in front of her.

The sisters are noble in comportment and remote in expression. The unusual positioning of their figures implies a complex and intimate relationship.|$|E

6000|$|... "Look!" [...] she said, stooping low, {{and laying}} <b>her</b> slim <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> palm downwards, across my table. I did look; {{and the first}} thing I noticed was how like herself that hand was, and how much less {{vigorous}} and formidable than Fanny's. And then I caught her meaning.|$|R
500|$|There {{are many}} varied {{depictions of the}} {{different}} forms of Kaali. The most common shows her with four arms and hands, showing aspects of creation and destruction. The two right hands are often held out in blessing, one in a mudra saying [...] "fear not" [...] (abhayamudra), the other conferring boons. <b>Her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> hold a severed head and blood-covered sword. The sword severs the bondage of ignorance and ego, represented by the severed head. One interpretation of Kaali's tongue is that the red tongue symbolizes the rajasic nature being conquered by the white (symbolizing sattvic) nature of the teeth. Her blackness represents that she is nirguna, beyond all qualities of nature, and transcendent.|$|R
25|$|She was {{estimated}} to be between 20 and 28 years old and had been raped. Basic physical examination showed she was about 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed about 118 pounds.

Her genitalia and rectum had been torn, caused in part by Bittaker having inserted pliers inside her body. In addition, <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> bore a puncture wound and a finger on her right hand had been slashed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, O'Donnell {{suffered}} a staph infection after she accidentally cut the middle finger of <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> with a knife while cutting a price tag off a fishing pole. The infection incapacitated her for weeks, and nearly resulted in doctors amputating her hand. She later quipped that George W. Bush was {{to blame for the}} infection, saying that she was preparing to go on a fishing trip at the time in order to avoid seeing Bush on television during the then-ongoing 2000 Republican National Convention.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{they reached}} the temple, a single room, {{surrounded}} by a spacious paved area; in front was an immense building capable of seating hundreds of people.

With a spear {{in one of her}} right hands she pierced the giant Mahisha; and with one of <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> she held the tail of a serpent, and the hair of the giant, whose breast the serpent was biting. Her other arms were all raised above her head, and were filled with different instruments of war; against her right leg leaned a lion.|$|R
6000|$|Claire {{stumbled}} to her feet, {{stood with}} her clenched right hand to her trembling lips, cupping it with <b>her</b> nervous <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>Her</b> shoulders were dejected. Milt pleaded, [...] "Let's hike out. I don't mind decent honest grease, but this place--look in at table! Dirty dishes---- And gin bottles on the floor!" ...|$|R
60|$|Admirably put, {{you will}} admit.
