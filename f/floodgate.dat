5|$|The rivers {{were run}} {{down by the}} 1920s and, with high {{unemployment}} in the area, West Ham Corporation and the Lee Conservancy Board applied for a government unemployment relief grant, with which to fund major improvements. In addition {{to work on the}} channels, Bow Tidal Lock was duplicated, Marshgate Lock was rebuilt further east as City Mill Lock, and a second new lock at Carpenters Road was constructed. It used up-and-over radial gates operated by winches, rather than the traditional mitre gates used at City Mill Lock. The gates were quadrant-shaped, and were raised out of the river to allow boats to enter or leave the lock. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1930 to authorise the work, called the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act, and work began the following year. The project was completed in 1935. Before the work, there had been a <b>floodgate</b> on the Waterworks River above its junction with the Three Mills Wall River, and a large pool, the City Mill Pool, connecting to the City Mills River and Saint Thomas Creek. Marshgate Lock was situated {{to the west of the}} junction between the Pudding Mill River and Saint Thomas Creek. It was originally built in 1864, by adding a second set of gates to Hunters Gates, a <b>floodgate</b> which had been built around 1847. The reconstructed lock was built on the site of the City Mill Pool, and had two sets of gates at its eastern end, to prevent high tidal levels in Waterworks River flooding the waterways to the west. It was labelled Marshgate Lane Lock on the 1948 map, but was called Ward Lock, after a local councillor, and is now known as City Mills Lock. The course of the Saint Thomas Creek was then straightened, and the original Marshgate Lock was bypassed. Pudding Mill River became a dead end when the lower section was filled in, as was most of the Three Mills Back River, and the <b>floodgate</b> on Waterworks River was also removed. Reconstruction of the channels included widening City Mill River to , while Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River were made twice that width.|$|E
5|$|Prior to its arrival, {{flooding}} {{across the}} central United States killed six people, forced {{thousands of people}} from their homes, and left at least $76million in damage (1986USD). Additional flooding from Paine exacerbated the situation; the flooding affected 52 of the 77 counties in Oklahoma, {{which resulted in a}} total of $350 million in damage, half of which from agriculture. The remnants of Paine brought {{about the end of the}} extended period of rainfall, which overall had forced 55,000 people from their homes, including 1,200 in East Saint Louis, Illinois where a <b>floodgate</b> broke. It was described as one of the worst floods in Oklahoma history.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{the impact}} of water {{projects}} (dams or <b>floodgates)</b> on river hydrology and the surrounding environment is important in river basin management. However, it is a difficult scientific issue due to its complexity. Huai River Basin is a unique region in China with high densities in both population and water projects and is experiencing a serious pollution problem. Based on the extended SWAT model with consideration of dams & <b>floodgates,</b> this paper proposes a quantitative framework {{to assess the impact of}} dams & <b>floodgates</b> on the river flow regimes and water quality in the middle and upper reaches of Huai River Basin. The results show that: (1) The dams & <b>floodgates</b> reduced the basin's annual average flow by 2 %, in comparison with the scenario of no water projects in the whole basin during 1991 - 2000, because of the regulation and storage of dams & <b>floodgates.</b> The flow in the non-flood season reduced 5 % while the change of flow in the flood season was not acute. The impact of dams & <b>floodgates</b> on the annual flow are different in wet and dry years. In the wet year (1991), the impact of dams & <b>floodgates</b> is not obvious because the gates were opened to control the floods and their main functions are to change the temporal distribution in a year. In the dry year (1999), the flow reduced remarkably in comparison with the flow without dams & <b>floodgates</b> in the basin because the gates were closed in order to meet the water demand. The flow in the flood season increased by 8 % whiles the flow in the non-flood season reduced by 12 %. (2) There was a certain impact of dams & <b>floodgates</b> on water quality but they were quite different in the different area. It would be changed from the positive effect to the negative effect from the upriver to downstream. The dams & <b>floodgates</b> in the upper reaches played a positive role to improve water quality. But the ones in the middle and lower reaches played a negative role with contribution from 0 to 0. 4. However, the contribution of exceeding pollutant discharge was more than 0. 6. (3) The joint operation of dams & <b>floodgates</b> to control water quantity and quality will improve the water environment in Huai River Basin, but the key to improve the basin's water environment is pollution control. This research will guide the anti-pollution and the united water quantity and quality assessment of dams & <b>floodgates</b> in Huai River Basin. Moreover it will provide a foundation to achieve the integrated basin management and sustainability of Huai River Basin...|$|R
50|$|Like the Vasse <b>floodgates,</b> the Wonnerup <b>floodgates</b> {{were built}} by the Public Works Department in 1907. The site chosen was near the forest beach road bridge and like the Vasse <b>floodgates,</b> they were {{refurbished}} in 1927, 1942, 1991 and replaced in 2004.

25|$|Hollow jet valves are {{a type of}} {{needle valve}} used for <b>floodgate</b> discharge. A cone and seat are inside a pipe. Water flows through an annular gap between the pipe and cone when it is moved downstream, away from the seat. Ribs support the bulb {{assembly}} and supply air for water jet stabilization.|$|E
25|$|Valves used in <b>floodgate</b> {{applications}} have {{a variety}} of design requirements and are usually located at the base of dams. Often, the most important requirement (besides regulating flow) is energy dissipation. Since water is very heavy, it exits the base of a dam with the enormous force of water pushing from above. Unless this energy is dissipated, the flow can erode nearby rock and soil and damage structures.|$|E
25|$|The {{area has}} been subject to {{flooding}} for centuries, both from the rivers and from the sea. While there is evidence for occupation of the region by Romans, Saxons, Danes and Normans, the first references to flood defences occur in the 11th and 12th centuries, when monks built a sea bank to hold back tides from their agricultural land. A sluice was constructed in 1142 on the River Witham to improve it for navigation, and Commissions of Sewers were appointed in the 13th century. They were empowered to investigate any problems with the drainage of the region, could appoint contractors to carry out work to rectify such problems, and had to assess how this work would be financed. Floods in 1394 resulted in a decision to rebuild a <b>floodgate</b> at Waynflete, with the villages affected paying the construction costs.|$|E

25|$|Just above Coopers Bridge, the Calder and Hebble {{enters a}} lock cut through a <b>floodgate.</b> The route to Ramsden's Canal follows {{the main course}} of the river, passing under the bridge which carries the A62 road over the river.

The canal turns to the south west to run parallel to the River Colne, and passes under a railway bridge to reach the Clone Bridge Lock. Just above it is a hammer-dressed stone warehouse, dating from the 18th century, followed by an arched bridge which carries Colne Bridge Road over the canal. A datestone indicates that it was built in 1775.|$|E
25|$|During the Franco years, marriages {{had to be}} {{canonical}} (that is, performed under Roman Catholic law and regulations) if {{even one}} of the partners was Catholic, which meant effectively that all marriages in Spain had to be sanctioned by the church. Since the church prohibited divorce, a marriage could be dissolved only through the arduous procedure of annulment, which was available only after a lengthy series of administrative steps and was thus accessible only to the relatively wealthy. These restrictions were probably one of the major reasons for a 1975 survey result showing that 71 percent of Spaniards favored legalizing divorce; however, because the government remained in the hands of conservatives until 1982, progress toward a divorce law was slow and full of conflict. In the summer of 1981, the Congress of Deputies (lower chamber of the Cortes Generales, or Spanish Parliament) finally approved a divorce law with the votes of about thirty Union of the Democratic Center (Union de Centro Democratico or UCD) deputies who defied the instructions of party conservatives. As a consequence, Spain had a divorce law that permitted the termination of a marriage in as little as two years following the legal separation of the partners. Still, it would be an exaggeration to say that the new divorce law opened a <b>floodgate</b> for the termination of marriages. Between the time the law went into effect at the beginning of September 1981, and the end of 1984, only slightly more than 69,000 couples had availed themselves of the option of ending their marriages, and the number declined in both 1983 and 1984. There were already more divorced people than this in Spain in 1981 before the law took effect.|$|E
