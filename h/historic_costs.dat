5000|$|Financial {{statements}} {{prepared in}} accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) show many assets based on their <b>historic</b> <b>costs</b> rather than at their current market values. For instance, a firm's balance sheet will usually show the value of land it owns at what the firm paid for it rather than at its current market value. But under GAAP requirements, a firm must show the fair values (which usually approximates market value) of some types of assets such as financial instruments that are held for sale rather than at their original cost. When a firm is required to show some of its assets at fair value, some call this process [...] "mark-to-market". But reporting asset values on financial statements at fair values gives managers ample opportunity to slant asset values upward to artificially increase profits and their stock prices. Managers may be motivated to alter earnings upward so they can earn bonuses. Despite the risk of manager bias, equity investors and creditors prefer to know the market values of a firm's assets—rather than their historical costs—because current values give them better information to make decisions.|$|E

Total Cost of Ownership combines these purchase and operating expenses to identify the most economical choice of vehicle. This is a valuable assessment for private and fleet purchasers alike. Studies to date have not compared Total Cost of Ownership across more than two vehicle markets or analysed <b>historic</b> <b>costs.</b> To address this gap, this research provides a more extensive Total Cost of Ownership assessment of conventional, Hybrid, Plug-in Hybrid and Battery Electric Vehicles in three industrialized countries – the UK, USA (using California and Texas as case studies) and Japan – for the time period 1997 – 2015. Finally, the link between Hybrid Electric Vehicle Total Cost of Ownership and market share is analysed with a panel regression model. In all regions the incremental Total Cost of Ownership of hybrid and electric vehicles compared to conventional vehicles has reduced from the year of introduction and 2015. Year on year Hybrid Electric Vehicles Total Cost of Ownership was found to vary least in the UK due {{to the absence of}} subsidies. Market share was found to be strongly linked to Hybrid Electric Vehicle Total Cost of Ownership through a panel regression analysis.

40|$|George O. May's (1952) prescient {{statement}} that "if accounting had not already become, {{it was well}} on its way to becoming a political phenomenon" provides the motivation for this study. Changing socioeconomic relationships in the post-World War II period make it an ideal period to examine the politicalization of accounting. Keynesian economic policies justified active government intervention in the economy to manage demand and ensure full employment. No longer could it be assumed that competitive market forces would ensure that corporations produced goods and services at a socially optimal level or that income would be distributed equitably. Claims that accounting profit provides a measure of managerial efficiency are based on these premises. This dissertation examines the political dynamics of one particular accounting measurement debate [...] the debate over the determination of business income. Policies, such as wage/price controls, the excess profits tax, and the undistributed profits tax, brought the accounting income determination debate to center stage. The perseverance of the <b>historic</b> <b>cost</b> allocation model in the face of significant economic changes presents a fascinating glimpse of the important role accounting played in justifying continued reliance on the private property rights paradigm. I use retrodiction (reasoning from present to past) to examine why the <b>historic</b> <b>cost</b> allocation model has been so enduring. In my examination, I use personal correspondence, transcripts of Congressional hearings, published financial statements, and relevant journal articles. My analysis indicates that, while accountants empathized with managers who claimed that inflation distorted reported earnings and recognized that a serious measurement scale issue existed, they also recognized that abandonment of <b>historic</b> <b>cost</b> would not be politically feasible. If accountants had adopted a strongly partisan position that favored management with respect to bargaining with labor, this could have undermined the profession's claim to neutrality and opened the standard-setting process to closer political scrutiny. Accountants responded to management in a less visible way. Standard setters adopted techniques that gave managers maximum flexibility in managing income while retaining the aura of objectivity that attached to <b>historic</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{model the}} {{interaction}} of financial market transparency and different accounting regimes. This paper provides a theoretical rationale for the recently proposed shift in accounting standards from <b>historic</b> <b>cost</b> accounting to marking to market. The paper shows that marking to market can provide investors with an early warning mechanism while historical cost gives management a "veil" under which they can potentially mask a firm's true economic performance. The model provides new explanations for several empirical findings and has some novel implications. We show that greater opacity in financial markets leads to more frequent and more severe crashes in asset prices (under a historic-cost-accounting regime). Moreover, our model indicates that <b>historic</b> <b>cost</b> accounting can make the financial market more rather than less volatile, which runs counter to conventional wisdom. The mechanism shown in the model also sheds light on the cause of many financial scandals in recent years.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a simple model where a regulated firm must make sunk investments in long-lived assets {{in order to}} produce output, assets exhibit a known but arbitrary pattern of depreciation, there are constant returns to scale within each period, and the replacement cost of assets is weakly falling over time due to technological progress. It is shown that a simple formula can be used to calculate the long run marginal cost of production each period and that the firm breaks even if prices are set equal to long run marginal cost. Furthermore, the formula for calculating long run marginal cost can be interpreted as a formula for calculating forward looking cost (where the current cost of using assets is based on the current replacement cost of assets). However, through appropriate choice of the accounting depreciation rule, it can also be interpreted as a formula for calculating <b>historic</b> <b>cost</b> (where the current cost of using assets is based on the <b>historic</b> purchase <b>cost</b> of assets). In particular, the results derived in the simple benchmark model of this paper contradict the commonly expressed view that measures of forward looking cost are superior to measures of <b>historic</b> <b>cost</b> in environments with declining asset prices. ...|$|R

In a hyper-inflationist economy the report without inflation re-treatment of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account is no more relevant for those who use accounting data, and the 90 s’ Romania certainly faced such a hyper-inflationist economy. As the evaluation basis in accountancy is <b>historic</b> <b>cost,</b> and, {{due to the fact that}} under circumstances of high inflation, <b>historic</b> <b>cost</b> suffers a series of changes that distort reality, several accounting methods are employed. Theses accounting methods under circumstances of inflation may rely on conversion, evaluation or other mixed methods that consist in re-treating the financial reports of the companies at opening and closing these financial reports. As under the present circumstances a too rapid economic growth is envisaged for Romania that might determine the increase of inflation, the re-treatment of the balance sheet and of the results account could be a necessity in the future. inflation, balance sheet, profit, loss, re-treatment, evaluation, index, adjustment, price, hyper-inflation...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{theoretical}} {{analysis suggests}} that {{by reducing the}} real value of depreciation deductions based on historic-cost asset prices, inflation reduces the incentive to purchase depreciable plant and equipment. This analysis also suggests that the negative effects of inflation on investment will be greater for equipment than structure, and will vary according to different initial assumptions about real interest rates and asset purchase prices. Further, previous arguments indicate that increases in inflation uncertainty lead to reductions in business investment, brought about by increased hurdle rates, greater planning costs, and an overall slower rate of economic activity. This research is designed to supply data necessary to evaluate the importance of these factors as determinants of investment demand. From the data provided in this dissertation, four basic conclusions are identified. First, the empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that the decline in {{the real value of}} depreciation deductions brough about by inflation leads to a decline in real business investment. The data suggests that such effects are substantial, and that failure to account for the interaction of inflation and <b>historic</b> <b>cost</b> depreciation leads to incorrect predictions of investment demand. Second, the evidence in this dissertation supports the hypothesis that inflation leads to a much greater decline in equipment than structures investment. This result persists over a wide range of assumed economic conditions, indicating that the recent shift in the composition of business investment toward equipment is not explained by increases in inflation. Third, the data also confirm the hypothesis that the effects of inflation and <b>historic</b> <b>cost</b> depreciation on investment will vary over time. Changes in investment brought about by changes in inflation are jointly determined with real interest rates and asset purchase prices, and proper measurement of such effects is critically dependent on additional economic variables. Finally, the evidence obtained by this research confirms the hypothesis that inflation uncertainty is a significant determinant of investment demand. Although these effects are much smaller than the measured effects of inflation and <b>historic</b> <b>cost</b> depreciation on investment, they are nevertheless significant to the explanation of recent business investment behavior...|$|R
