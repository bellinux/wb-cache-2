6000|$|If we {{now turn}} to the {{enormous}} group of moths, which, as I hear from Mr. Stainton, do not habitually expose the under surface of their wings to full view, we find this side very rarely coloured with a brightness greater than, or even equal to, that of the upper side. Some exceptions to the rule, either real or apparent, must be noticed, as the case of Hypopyra. (16. See Mr. Wormald on this moth: 'Proceedings of the Entomological Society,' March 2, 1868.) Mr. Trimen informs me that in Guenee's great work, three moths are figured, in which the under surface is much the more brilliant. For instance, in the Australian Gastrophora the upper surface of the fore-wing is pale greyish-ochreous, while the lower surface is magnificently ornamented by an ocellus of cobalt-blue, placed {{in the midst of}} a black mark, surrounded by orange-yellow, and this by bluish-white. But the habits of these three moths are unknown; so that no explanation can be given of their unusual style of colouring. Mr. Trimen also informs me that the lower surface of the wings in certain other <b>Geometrae</b> (17. See also an account of the S. American genus Erateina (one of the <b>Geometrae)</b> in 'Transactions, Ent. Soc.' new series, vol. v. pl. xv. and xvi.) and quadrifid Noctuae are either more variegated or more brightly-coloured than the upper surface; but some of these species have the habit of [...] "holding their wings quite erect over their backs, retaining them in this position for a considerable time," [...] and thus exposing the under surface to view. Other species, when settled on the ground or herbage, now and then suddenly and slightly lift up their wings. Hence the lower surface of the wings being brighter than the upper surface in certain moths is not so anomalous as it at first appears. The Saturniidae include some of the most beautiful of all moths, their wings being decorated, as in our British Emperor moth, with fine ocelli; and Mr. T.W. Wood (18. 'Proc Ent. Soc. of London,' July 6, 1868, p. xxvii.) observes that they resemble butterflies in some of their movements; [...] "for instance, in the gentle waving up and down of the wings as if for display, which is more characteristic of diurnal than of nocturnal Lepidoptera." ...|$|R

40|$|Este artigo examina certos pontos essenciais do método cartesiano e seu fundamento. (1) Dado que Descartes elege a análise como seu método, é a partir da antiga tradição dos <b>geômetras</b> gregos que devemos examiná-la. (2) Seu método não é, entretanto, de natureza matemática. A análise põe às claras o modo de a razão conhecer, ilustrado por essa ciência. (3) A reflexão cartesiana distingue metodologia de epistemologia. Relações de dependência entre objetos são, em geral, estabelecidas a partir do relativo e do complexo, dada a primazia metodológica destes em relação ao absoluto e ao simples. (4) Um dos modos mais profundos de justificar essa primazia do dependente e, com isso, justificar o método de análise, na medida em que é um procedimento contra a corrente liga-se à tese cartesiana de que compreender algo é compreender a sua causa, visto que todo existente existe como efeito. (5) O método de análise, portanto, pode assumir, como é de sua essência, o efeito como dado e proceder "para cima" em busca da causa, e seu fundamento está no axioma da identidade entre a causa e a razão, causa sive ratio. This article {{examines}} certain essential points of Cartesian method and its foundation. (1) If Descartes selects analysis as his method _ {{and he does}} {{it is from the}} ancient tradition of Greek geometers that we should survey it. (2) However, the nature of his method as such is not mathematical: analysis discloses how reason comes to know, as illustrated by the science of geometry. (3) Cartesian thinking distinguishes methodology and epistemology: relationships of dependency among objects are, in general, established starting from relative and complex ones, given their methodological primacy in relation to the absolute and the simple. (4) One of the most fruitful ways to justify this and, thus, to justify the method of analysis, as far as it is a procedure "against the current" is connected with the Cartesian thesis that affirms that to understand something is to understand its cause, {{due to the fact that}} everything that exists, exists as an effect. (5) It is of the essence of the method of analysis, therefore, that it may assume the effect as given and proceed backwards (or upwards) in search of the cause; and its foundation is the axiom of identity between cause and reason, causa sive ratio...|$|R

Depois de seu encontro com Beeckman, Descartes engajou-se no projeto de construir uma ciência completamente nova. Desse modo, reconstruímos a trajetória seguida inicialmente por Descartes, avaliando a sua produção científica em trabalhos como Cogitationes Privatae, De Solidorum Elementis, Regulae ad Directionem Ingenii, onde podemos detectar o envolvimento de Descartes com questões científicas que serão coligidas na sua {{principal}} obra O Discurso do Método.

40|$|Esse trabalho aborda vários aspectos da metafísica de kantiana. Kant pretende promover uma verdadeira mudança no modo de pensar a metafísica, já que o contexto no qual ele escreve a Crítica da Razão Pura era dominado pela metafísica escolástica, que chama de dogmática. Para o filosofo a metafísica deveria deixar o campo da escuridão especulativa e se guiar pelo caminha das ciências tal como a matemática e a física. Essa metafísica dogmática trabalhava assuntos como a liberdade da alma, a bondade de Deus entre outras neste sentido. Essa forma de trabalhar a metafísica não era capaz de {{responder}} às críticas formuladas pelos céticos. Deste modo, para Kant a metafísica deveria servir como uma propedêutica do modo de pensar e não como se fazia antes. Para realizar de modo eficaz essa sua empreitada ele sugere algumas alterações na maneira como se fazia metafísica. Principalmente, a mudança no método e na forma como se vai ao objeto do conhecimento. A primeira é a substituição do método de analise lógica, que era praticado pelos escolásticos, para o método de analise e síntese, ou método de descoberta e prova, dos <b>geômetras</b> gregos. Conquanto, a segunda consiste na modificação do caminho, quando se almeja o conhecimento a priori. Antes, trilhava-se tal via do objeto para o sujeito e, a partir da proposta kantiana, o percurso deve ser feito do sujeito para o objeto. Com esta mudança de caminho, consolida-se algo semelhante à revolução de Copérnico. Antes de Copérnico, as estrelas giravam ao redor do homem, inclusive o Sol, e depois dele ocorre o inverso. Depois dessas primeiras considerações, ainda são necessários alguns pontos a fim de estabelecer a metafísica enquanto ciência. O principal deles é que, já que seu conteúdo é absolutamente a priori, ela deve operar sempre segundo juízos sintéticos a priori. Então, para responder a pergunta de como é possível a metafísica enquanto ciência, ele deve antes responder como são possíveis juízos sintéticos a priori. Portanto, são apresentados vários dos conceitos que constituem a metafísica Kantiana, a fim de mostrar a resposta de Kant às questões acima citadas. Conceitos como: os princípios do entendimento puro; a faculdade de julgar; as intuições puras; os conceitos puros do entendimento; e a lógica transcendental. _______________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis work discusses {{various aspects}} of Kantian metaphysics. Kant seeks to promote a real change in way metaphysics was thought, since {{the context in which}} he wrote the Critique of the Pure Reason was dominated by scholastic metaphysics, which calls dogmatic. For the philosopher, metaphysics should leave the field of speculative darkness and walks guided by science such as mathematics and physics. This dogmatic metaphysics worked issues as freedom of the soul, the goodness of God and others subjects like that. This way of working metaphysics was not able to respond to criticisms made by skeptics. Thus, for Kant's metaphysics should serve as a propaedeutic of the way of thinking and not like it was donne before. To effectively accomplish his enterprise, he suggests some changes to the way it was donne metaphysics. Mostly, the change in the method and how someone goes to the object of knowledge. The first is the replacement of the method of logical analysis, which was practiced by the Scholastics, to the method of analysis and synthesis, or method of discovery and proof of the Greek geometers. While the second consists in the modification of the road, when you crave a priori knowledge. Before, trailed up such a route from the object to the subject, and after the Kantian proposal, the route should be made from the subject to the object. With this change of route, consolidates up something similar to the Copernican revolution. Before Copernicus, the stars revolved around the man, including the sun, and after him the opposite occurs. After these first reflection, some points are still needed to establish metaphysics as a science. The main one is that, since its content is absolutely a priori, it must always operate second synthetic judgments a priori. So, to answer the question of how it is possible the metaphysics as a science, it must meet before answer how synthetic judgments a priori are possible. Therefore, there are shown several of the concepts that constitute the metaphysics of Kant, in order to show the Kantian answer to the questions mentioned above. Concepts such as the principles of the pure understanding, the faculty of judging, the pure intuitions, pure concepts of the understanding, and transcendental logic...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} acute toxicity of Raphia vinifera on fish leech, Piscicola <b>geometra.</b> The leeches {{with a mean}} total length of (TL) 4. 2 + 1. 0 cm were exposed to various concentrations of both crude powdered and ethanolic extracts of the botanical. Median lethal concentration (LC 50) was determined with static-renewal tests using logarithmic and arithmetic graphic methods. The LC 50 (for 96 hours of crude powdered (aqueous) extracts of the botanical on Piscicola <b>geometra</b> was 1. 10 ppm arithmetically and 1. 14 ppm logarithmically. The 95 % confidence limits was 0. 10 ppm arithmetically and 0. 12 ppm logarithmically. The LC 50 of ethanolic extract of the poison at 96 -h was 0. 5 ppm arithmetically and 0. 48 ppm logarithmically. The 95 % confidence limits were less than 0. 10 ppm. The use of extracts of R. vinifera in the control of leeches in fish ponds is discusse...|$|E
40|$|PhDCertain factors {{controlling}} the parasitic phase of some nonspecific fish ectoparasites were investigated. Studies {{were made of}} the infection patterns exhibited by the branchiuran Argulus foliaceus (L.), the fish leeches Piscicola <b>geometra</b> (L.) and Hemiclepsis marginata (Mull.) and glochidia larvae of Anodonta cygnea (L.) on freshwater fish. Aspects of the parasites life history, survival, development, seasonal cycles in incidence, dispersion patterns, immigration and site selection were investigated by field and laboratory studies. In adult A. foli. aceus and P. <b>geometra,</b> the initial attacking a phase onto the fish host {{does not appear to}} be influenced by densitydependent factors. In larval A. foliaceus, infection is also unaffected by parasite density, but in adults, it is controlled at high parasite numbers when the carrying capacity of the fish is reached. The infection patterns of A. foliaceus appear to reflect the heterogeneity of both host and parasite populations, particularly with respect to variations in host susceptibility and to parasite searching activity. In adult P. georn tra, the parasitic phase is influenced by density-dependent factors with increasing intraspecific competition at high densities. The population processes {{controlling the}}se parasites are compared to other types of host/parasite systems...|$|E

40|$|In {{brackish}} water {{the variety of}} marine and freshwater parasite species is considerably reduced. The distribution in {{brackish water}} of most marine endoparasites is restricted by the salinity tolerance of their hosts, most of the parasite species are more tolerant than their hosts. The influence of salinity and temperature on nine species has been examined; first stage larvae of Contracaecum aduncum develop in 0 - 32 ‰ salinity; Cryptocotyle lingua proved to be infective at salinities down to 4 ‰. The greatest resistance was found in Anisakis larvae from herring Clupea harengus, which survived {{for more than half}} a year. Parasites in the fish intestines appear to be unaffected by changing water salinities, as the osmolarity in the intestines stays nearly constant. Marine ectoparasites (Acanthochondria depressa, Lepeophtheirus pectoralis) survive about three times longer than freshwater species (Piscicola <b>geometra,</b> Argulus foliaceus) when salinity is 16 ‰. High temperature increases the effects of adverse salinities on parasites. There is evidence that none of these ecto-parasitic species can develop within the range of 7 - 20 ‰ salinity...|$|E
