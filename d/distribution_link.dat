40|$|In the NASA/JPL Deep Space Network (DSN), radio science {{experiments}} (probing {{outer planet}} atmospheres, rings, gravitational waves, etc.) and very long-base interferometry (VLBI) require ultra-stable, low phase noise reference frequency signals at the user locations. Typical locations for radio science/VLBI exciters and down-converters are the cone {{areas of the}} 34 m high efficiency antennas or the 70 m antennas, located several hundred meters from the reference frequency standards. Over the past three years, fiber optic distribution links have replaced coaxial cable distribution for reference frequencies to these antenna sites. Optical fibers are the preferred medium for distribution because of their low attenuation, immunity to EMI/IWI, and temperature stability. A new network of Beam Waveguide (BWG) antennas presently under construction in the DSN requires hydrogen maser stability at tens of kilometers distance from the frequency standards central location. The topic {{of this paper is}} the design and implementation of an optical fiber <b>distribution</b> <b>link</b> which provides ultra-stable reference frequencies to users at a remote BWG antenna. The temperature profile from the earth's surface to a depth of six feet over a time period of six months was used to optimize the placement of the fiber optic cables. In-situ evaluation of the fiber optic link performance indicates Allan deviation on the order of parts in 10 (exp - 15) at 1000 and 10, 000 seconds averaging time; thus, the link stability degradation due to environmental conditions still preserves hydrogen maser stability at the user locations.

40|$|Mixed {{binomial}} {{models are}} frequently {{used to provide}} estimates for the unknown size of a partially observed population when capture–recapture data are available through a known, finite, number of identification (sampling) sources. In this context, inherently major problems may be the lack of identifiability of the mixing <b>distribution</b> (<b>Link,</b> 2003) and boundary problems in ML estimation for mixed binomial models (such as the beta-binomial or finite mixture of binomials), see e. g. Dorazio and Royle, 2003 and Dorazio and Royle, 2005. To solve these problems, we introduce a novel regression estimator based on observed ratios of successive capture frequencies. Both simulations and real data examples show that the proposed estimator frequently leads to under-estimate the true population size, but with a smaller bias and a lower variability {{when compared to other}} well-known estimators...|$|E
40|$|Heterogeneous {{communication}} networks {{with their}} variety of application demands, uncertain time-varying trafc load, and mixture of wired and wireless links pose several challenging problem in modeling and control. In this paper {{we focus on}} the round-trip time (RTT), which is a particularly important variable for efficient end-to-end congestion control. Based on a simple aggregated model of the network, an algorithm combining a Kalman lter and a change detection algorithm is proposed for RTT estimation. It is illustrated on real data that this algorithm provides estimates of significantly better accuracy as compared to the RTT estimator currently used in TCP. We also analyze how wireless links affect the RTT <b>distribution.</b> <b>Link</b> re-transmissions induce delays which do not conform to the assumptions on which the transport protocol is based. This causes undesired TCP control actions which reduce throughput. A link layer solution based on adding carefully selected delays to certain packets is proposed to counteract this problem.

30|$|We {{study the}} {{performance}} of DEMON in IEEE 802.11 -based MWNs by means of simulation, to which end we consider {{a wide range of}} scenarios, each of them with particular characteristics in terms of offered load, number of flows, spatial node <b>distribution,</b> <b>link</b> rates, mobility, and use of single- or multi-radio nodes. According to the results, DEMON outperforms default AODV in all the scenarios used in the evaluation due to its preemptive recovery of degraded routes. In mobile scenarios, DEMON can provide an increase of up to 90 % of goodput by anticipating link breaks and minimizing route disconnections. The improvement is equal to or greater than that achieved by state-of-the-art preemptive solutions according to the literature. In stationary networks, the average improvement is smaller, about 10 % to 30 %, since as load increases, congestion and interference leave little margin for improving performance by changing the flow distribution in the network. In the absence of mobility, {{the performance of}} state-of-the-art preemptive solutions would be analogous to that of default AODV.|$|E

The Internet architecture was designed underlying the existing of the end-to-end path connection. The promise of wireless Internet networks is to provide roaming users connectivity anywhere anytime.

In this thesis, a credit-based user authentication scheme is proposed for delay tolerant mobile wireless networks. The proposed authentication scheme isolates the uncertain network condition in the high delay wireless backhaul with high error rate, and accelerates the overall authentication process when the mobile terminal roams in the visited network. Furthermore, an analytical study of overall network performance is presented for the authentication scheme in terms of authentication cost and delay.

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) The {{last mile}} {{distribution}} {{is the final}} link of successful supply chain operations. The high demand for products, lead time uncertainties and replenishment time complicate the distribution task. In order to achieve a competitive business edge, suppliers need to work at developing and improving their last mile <b>distribution</b> <b>link.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effectiveness of the last mile wine distribution in Lagos Island, Nigeria, and to determine appropriate improvement strategies that can be recommended to wine suppliers. A qualitative research design was used in order to address the key research questions. Wine suppliers in Lagos Island, Nigeria were sampled for the study and mainly surveyed using open-structured interviews. The results of the research suggest that human resources factors influence the effectiveness of the last mile distribution. In addition, management-related factors also affect it. It was also noted that the effectiveness of last mile distribution for the wine suppliers is hampered by supply chain and logistics limitations. However, the findings indicate that the suppliers were able to contend with these challenges by applying some logistics strategies and personal initiatives to keep making profit. The study is expected to not only add value to current wine suppliers in Lagos Island, Nigeria, but also to potential investors interested in the Nigerian wine market.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{terrestrial}} atmospheric FSO {{communication systems}} {{operating under the}} influence of turbulence-induced scintillation, beam spreading, optical interchannel crosstalk, amplified spontaneous emission noise and pointing errors. On-off keying-non–return-to-zero (OOK-NRZ) and digital pulse position (DPPM) are the modulation schemes used for the calculations. The possibility of using sophisticated performance evaluation techniques such as moment generating function (MGF) -based Chernoff bound (CB), modified Chernoff bound (MCB) and saddlepoint approximation (SPA) for terrestrial DPPM and OOK-NRZ–based FSO communication systems employing optical amplification are investigated and compared with the conventional Gaussian approximation (GA) method. Relative to the other techniques, the MCB can be considered a safe estimation method for practical systems since it provides an upper bound upon the BER. The turbulent optically preamplified DPPM FSO receiver employing integration over a time slot and comparing the results to choose the largest slot, is seen to give better advantage (about 7 - 9 dB) compared to an equivalent employing OOK-NRZ signalling. The atmospheric turbulence-induced spreading of the beam, ASE noise, and pointing error are seen to combine in a problematic way resulting in high BERs, {{depending on the size of}} the receiver and the beam’s jitter standard deviation. Using FSO communication for the distribution links of a passive optical network-like wavelength division multiplexing access network is investigated in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, ASE noise and interchannel crosstalk. The results show that, for clear atmosphere, FSO <b>distribution</b> <b>link</b> length up to 2000 m can be reliably used (depending on turbulence strength) to achieve human eye safety and high capacity access networks. Also, error floors occur due to turbulence accentuated crosstalk effect for the cases of (i) signal turbulent, but crosstalk not and (ii) crosstalk turbulent, but signal not.
