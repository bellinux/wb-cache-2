50|$|A {{centrifugal}} oil cleaner is a rotary sedimentation device using {{centrifugal force}} rather than gravity to separate contaminants from the oil, {{in the same}} manner as any other centrifuge.

The oil then slides to the bottom of the housing wall, leaving particulate oil contaminants stuck to the housing walls. The housing must periodically be cleaned, or the particles will accumulate to such a thickness as to stop the drum rotating. In this condition, unfiltered oil will be recirculated.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{excitation}} {{sources for}} disk vibrations {{are present in}} optical drives. For increasing rotation speeds, airflow-housing-induced vibrations have {{become more and more}} important. Currently, drives are designed in which rotation speeds are so high that critical speed resonances may show up. The presence of these resonances depends on the layout of the <b>inner</b> <b>housing</b> geometry of the drive. The influence of the drive <b>inner</b> <b>housing</b> geometry is investigated systematically by means of a numerical-experimental approach. An analytical model is derived, containing disk dynamics and the geometry-induced pressure distribution acting as the excitation mechanism on the disk. The Reynolds' lubrication equation is used as a first approach for the modeling of the pressure distribution. The model is numerically implemented using an approach based on a combination of finite element and finite difference techniques. An idealized, drive-like environment serves as the experimental setup. This setup resembles the situation in the numerical model, {{in order to be able}} to verify the numerical model. Wedge-like airflow disturbances are used in order to obtain insight into the influence of drive inner geometry on the critical speed resonances of optical disks. A disk tilt measurement method is designed that yields a global view of the disk deformation. By means of two newly proposed types of plots, numerical and experimental results can be compared in a straightforward way. A qualitative match between the numerical and experimental results is obtained. The numerical and experimental methods presented provide insight into airflow-housing-induced vibrations in optical drives. Additionally, reduction of some critical speed resonances is found to be possible for certain drive inner geometry configurations...|$|E

The powertrain concept consists of a single-shaft engine with a ceramic inner shell for containment of hot gasses and support of twin regenerators.

The typology was constructed according to Czekanowski methodology, which is classified as a cluster analysis. Optimal effect of municipal housing services districts ranking was accomplished when index distance function was used and thanks to sorting Czekanowski diagram according to simple autoalgorithm.
