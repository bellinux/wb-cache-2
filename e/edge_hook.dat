40|$|DE 10021341 A UPAB: 20020213 NOVELTY - The {{assembly}} to lay weft yarns, preferably in a multi-layer structure of multi-axial yarns, has a controlled yarn layer (30) {{to guide the}} wefts (20). It is moved together with rows of moving hooks on chains at the edges to hold the yarns in place and move the laid yarn layer(s) in a forward direction while retaining their orientation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - In a laying cycle of the weft yarn band laying system, the yarn layer carries a number of wefts, to lay them at the moving <b>edge</b> <b>hooks</b> {{in at least two}} laying stages for different yarn orientations and at least two laying stages on the reverse movements. The width of the laid weft yarns is controlled at the side edges of the yarn layer(s) or outside the laying stages. The start position of the forward and backward layer laying stage is set according to an actual position of an oriented weft yarn band already laid in place, which is the actual growth position in relation to the hook chains. The advance movement of the hook carrier chains is controlled according to the duration of a yarn laying cycle. The hook carrier chains have a synchronized forward movement, according to the yarn laying cycle. The yarn laying cycle has a laying stage for the oriented yarns, a deflection stage around the <b>edge</b> <b>hooks,</b> and a return stage with a different yarn orientation. The gaps between the yarn guide openings (33) at the yarn layer are altered according to changes in the yarn laying orientation. Before adjustment, the yarn layer is rotated into a different angular alignment. The control sets the number of yarn laying stages at the <b>edge</b> <b>hooks</b> for different laying cycles and/or an advance of the laid and oriented wefts in each laying cycle, according to the advance movement of the hook chains on each laying cycle. The yarn laying movement extends as far as behind the needles of a side edge fixing system. After laying a band of wefts, the orientation is set by the yarn layer at an entry point for the next laying stage. A laying stage is extended after the side edge, by the length of a racking path, while the yarn layer is lowered. As the yarn layer is lowered, an edge fixing system grips the band of wefts from above to apply a grip to fix a section of the laid yarn band. The yarn layer and edge fixing system move on a swing path to the hook laying point of the next laying stage, and the yarn is transferred at the hook laying point. As the laid yarn is moved upwards in a curved yarn laying action around the hook laying point, the next laying stage starts to apply tension to the yarn. The fixing unit has a comb structure to grip the tensed yarns to give a new hook laying width between the fixing system and the yarn layer. The laid yarns can be tensed by lowering the yarn layer to a transfer comb, to tense the yarns at it by an angled rear movement and a following upwards movement and release them from the fixing system. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a system to lay bands of weft yarns at given orientations, by a controlled yarn layer which carries a number of weft yarns, to be caught at the <b>edges</b> by <b>hooks</b> on moving chains. Preferred Features: An additional yarn layer is used when laying more than three layers of weft yarns. The interval can be adjusted between the yarn guide openings at the layer, and the yarn guides (32, 34) can be in a number of parts. The yarn layer has a slitted plate with diverging yarn channels, especially as slits. The plate can have a lateral sliding movement to set the yarn guide slits according to the width of the laid band of wefts. The yarn layer can be rotated to alter the gaps between the weft yarns. The yarn layer can have a grid bar with holes to guide the weft yarns, to be rotated into different angular alignments for a laying stage. The weft layer, to lay a number of weft yarn band layers, gives layers in mirror image alignments against each other. USE - The assembly is for laying bands of weft yarns to be held at the <b>edges</b> by <b>hooks</b> on moving chains. ADVANTAGE - The operation gives a smooth transfer of weft direction around the <b>edge</b> <b>hooks.</b> Weft yarn losses at the edges are reduced, with an increased number of weft yarns. The productivity is increased without increasing the yarn laying speed...|$|R

5000|$|Puya chilensis is a {{terrestrial}} bromeliad {{originating from}} the arid hillsides of Chile. An evergreen perennial, it forms large, dense rosettes of grey-green, strap-like leaves <b>edged</b> with <b>hooked</b> spines. The green or yellow flowers are borne on spikes which resemble a medieval mace, {{and stand up}} to 2 m high. Spreading by offsets, Puya chilensis can colonise large areas over time. Growth is slow and plants may take 20 years or more to flower. The outer two-thirds of the leaf blade bears outward-pointing spines which may be an adaptation to prevent herbivores from reaching {{the center of the}} plant. The plant is believed to be hazardous to sheep and birds which may become entangled in the spines of the leaves. If the animal dies, the plant may gain nutrients as the animal decomposes nearby, though this has not been confirmed. For this reason, Puya chilensis has earned the nickname [...] "sheep-eating plant". If true, this would make Puya chilensis a protocarnivorous plant. Fibers from the leaves are used to weave durable fishing-nets.|$|R

50|$|Hook Jaw {{was created}} by Mills as a Jaws cash-in and the {{flagship}} title of the comic. The strip was scripted by Ken Armstrong and drawn by Ramon Sola. Hook Jaw is a Great White Shark and {{the hero of the}} series, even though he {{spends most of his time}} eating most of the human cast of characters. The name Hook Jaw comes from the gaff hook stuck in the shark's jaw after some fisherman tried to catch the creature shortly before being eaten by it. Mills gave the strip an environmental <b>edge</b> by having <b>Hook</b> Jaw eat corrupt humans, or criminals, seeking to exploit the seas, as well as anyone else unlucky enough to get near him. Hook Jaw appeared in three stories before the ban. The first was set on an oil rig, the second was set on an island resort in the Caribbean, and the third was set just off the south coast of England. Hook Jaw returned after the ban, but no longer ate as many people and if he did it was off panel. The strip also lost the environmental themes Mills had placed in it. Spitfire Comics in 2007 released a collection of the pre-ban strips in Collected Hook Jaw vol.1.|$|R
50|$|The Type 99 is {{a smooth}} bore, muzzle-loading weapon of the Stokes-Brandt type. The Type 99 81 mm mortar {{differs from the}} Type 97 81 mm {{infantry}} mortar in the shortness of its tube, which is only 21.75 inches as compared with 45.34 inches of the Type 97. The mortar can be disassembled into three units: the tube, the bipod, and the base plate. The legs of the bipod, made of tubular steel, are mounted on the elevating screw housing by a clevis joint. They terminate in thin steel plates which have single-pointed spikes on the underside. The spread of the legs is limited by a chain which has a spring attached to one end to relieve the shock of firing. A buffer system incorporated in the bipod gives a recuperation of 2 inches. The recoil cylinders are filled with light grease or heavy oil. The base plate, made of pressed steel, has a series of ribs and braces welded on the underside {{to allow it to}} dig into the ground when the piece is fired. On the top side of the plate, in the center, is a circular depression into which the base-cap knob fits when the mortar is mounted in firing position. A carrying handle is attached to the rear edge of the plate. Also, two small hooks are welded to the rear edge to permit the attachment of a carrying strap. Around {{the outer edge of the}} plate is a one-inch ridge, and on the lower front <b>edge</b> a <b>hook</b> is attached through which a small rod can be thrust and used for slight changes in base plate alignment. A stability test of the Type 99 mortar, in which a total of 14 rounds were fired, produced no visible evidence of cracking or deformation of either base plate or bipod. The plate sank about 2 inches into the ground with the firing of seven rounds at alternate elevations of 45 to 75 degrees. Stability was very satisfactory when firing zone charges I to IV, but zones V to VI produced noticeable hop of the mortar and a sinking of the base plate. The reported range of the weapon of about 2,200 yards has not been conclusively confirmed.|$|R

The breast is brownish and not blue as in the European Roller. The crown and vent are blue. The primaries are deep purplish blue with a band of pale blue. The tail is sky blue with a terminal band of Prussian blue and the central feathers are dull green. The neck and throat are purplish lilac with white shaft streaks. The bare patch around the eye is ochre in colour. The three forward toes are united at the base. Rollers have a long and compressed bill with a curved upper <b>edge</b> and a <b>hooked</b> tip.

The subspecies indicus is found in peninsular India and Sri Lanka. The southern form has a darker reddish collar on the hind neck which is missing in the nominate form. The race affinis of northeastern India and Southeast Asia (Thailand, Myanmar, Indochina) is sometimes considered a full species, but within the Indian region, it is seen to intergrade with benghalensis.

2500|$|After {{the fourth}} Test of their five-Test {{series against the}} West Indies in 1966, England were 3–0 down and had lost the series. Needing someone {{to come in to}} {{revitalise}} the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, [...] "I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, {{and we are going to}} keep the pressure on and keep it on for five days." [...] What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers <b>hooked,</b> <b>edged</b> the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch – or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs.|$|R

This is detected by {{an increase in the number}} of defect that do not meet the quality standard of both the company and consumers. Defects that occur in the production process of the current royal tile types such errors on the long process of soaking and arrangement of tiles on a soaking tub due to a lack of clear working procedures as well as the fault of the operator. The purpose of this thesis is to reduce the number of defects and obtain cost savings for companies using Six Sigma. The stages of this study is the first to define the stage, explained the object of study selection, identify the type of defect, and the flowchart of the production process. While on stage measure, determine the product attributes that are critical to the quality of CTQ (Critical To Quality), measuring the level of defects in the form of DPMO and sigma level that will be the foundation of early performance. Furthermore, the stage of analyzing the types of defects analyze the main pedestal in improving the quality problem and what factors are the cause of defects by using a fishbone diagram. And improve on the stage, using failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) to assist in determining the corrective action plan that can be implemented to reduce defect levels. The last stage is the control, which document the repairs and make control charts to track and monitor the production process. The survey results revealed that the most dominant defect occurred in the company was broken at the <b>edges,</b> and the <b>hook</b> is not perfect. The corrective actions taken to improve stages, namely the procedural flow of clear and structured activities in the socialization process of soaking through the standard operating procedure (SOP) to workers and provide directions arrangement of tiles on a soaking tub.
