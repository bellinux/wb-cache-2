The UNSC's vehicles were designed by Marcus Lehto, Eric Arroyo, and Eddie Smith, and were designed to be functional and utilitarian. Their use of wheels also led many players to feel that they were more <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive.</b> The addition of the Mongoose ATV made headlines, after being cut from Halo 2. The original Warthog was considered a fan favorite.|$|E
500|$|As {{teenagers}} {{were among}} the target audiences for the C5, some commentators also raised the prospect of (in Adamson and Kennedy's words) [...] "packs of 14-year-olds terrorising the neighbourhood in their customised C5s". The secretary of the Cyclists Touring Club raised the prospect of [...] "kids us them in a pretty wild way. They may run them over paths and pavements and knock people down." [...] Sinclair dismissed such concerns – [...] "I have qualms about seven-year-olds riding bicycles on the open road, but I have far fewer qualms about a 14-year-old driving one of these". Teenagers interviewed by The Guardian were doubtful about whether they would want a C5, commenting that while it was <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> they felt insecure in it and preferred their bicycles.|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first victory of the season; the win earned him $198,550. He said, [...] "I don't {{know how many times}} I spun out and didn't spin out. Amazing race. It was <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> when I wasn't getting turned around", and, [...] "Stab and steer, stab and steer, That's what you do. And some brakes. There are brakes involved, too. I thought I was clear... and I tried going down slowly, and Jimmie just must have been there a little bit, turned me sideways and got me on the apron—scared everybody half to death, including me." [...] Stewart, who finished second, said, [...] "I actually had fun racing at Daytona again, which I haven't had for a while. I don't know what the consensus is from everybody else, but I had more fun as a driver tonight than what we've had in the past." [...] Ambrose, who finished third in the race, explained, [...] "It's definitely a lot more fun, more entertaining for the fans, and more in control for the drivers." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{automotive}} journalist, Michael Lamm, the new AMX had [...] "noticeably tighter shocks {{and gives}} a firm and comfortable ride"; [...] "corner with the very best" [...] with little lean, {{as well as the}} standard six-cylinder engine that combines good performance with fuel economy, and the four-speed [...] "gearbox that's fun to use and has long, long gears." [...] The autommaker's marketing campaign for the new AMX included a separate dealer promotional video focusing on the youthfulness and <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> characteristics. Product placement of the 1978 AMX included the Wonder Woman TV series. Approximately 2,500 AMXs were built for the 1978 model year.|$|E
2500|$|The critic from Official PlayStation Magazine UK {{felt that}} it wasn't a [...] "bad game, merely a game with no purpose." [...] Cameron Lewis of Official Xbox Magazine felt that the {{omission}} of weaponry allowed the game to appeal to fans of older arcade racing games such as Super Sprint. He praised the addition of local multiplayer, but questioned the lack of online play. Lewis noted that the tracks were attractive and <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive,</b> yet kept a difficulty level that made them difficult to master. Gamezebo's Mike Rose also praised the racing mechanics, including solid track design and strong AI opponents, but lamented the lack of online multiplayer.|$|E

5000|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. The game received {{a rating of}} 6/10 from IGN, criticizing the loose controls and inconsistencies with the boost mechanic. Most reviewers agreed that, although Kinect Joy Ride offered lightweight fun, {{it was not a}} very satisfying game compared to the other launch titles, and easily forgettable. Video game talk show Good Games two presenters gave the game a 5 and 4 out of 10 stating that the steering felt too unreliable {{and that it would be}} a lot more fun if were playing it with a regular controller and its an experiment gone wrong.

5000|$|Kevin Harvick {{scored the}} pole {{for the race}} {{with a time of}} 27.547 and a speed of 196.026 mph. He said {{afterwards}} that he [...] "just got to the green a little bit better. The car was too loose the time before. And I got to the green better. It was good in (Turns) 1 and 2; but I felt like I gave up a little something in (Turns) 3 and 4 coming to the checkered. But, I’ve just got to thank all my sponsors and everybody on this team, Chevrolet and Hendrick engines and chassis for everything that they do and for everything that Stewart-Haas (Racing) does. This has just been a <b>fun</b> car <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> today. Hopefully we can get it dialed in race trim.” ...|$|R
2500|$|In Japan, Famitsu {{gave it a}} {{score of}} one eight, one nine, one ten, and one nine {{for a total of}} 36 out of 40. One {{reviewer}} said, [...] "The way you participate in events and run races on public roads serves well as a new direction for the series. [...] Earning popularity for things like drifting and other stuff makes it <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> just <b>drive</b> around, but I still wish there was something more unique to this game. I have to give top marks to the graphics and ease of play, though." [...] Another reviewer stated, [...] "This used to be a really stoic racing simulator, but this is more of a driving game designed to be easy to pick up. I feel like the controls are more forgiving, too, and the open-world freedom makes the whole thing a lot more approachable." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Jensen GT (hatchback coupe) - was {{introduced}} in attempt to broaden the sales base of the Jensen Healey, which had {{up to that time}} been a roadster or convertible. Its road test report in Motor Magazine and a very similar one, soon after, in Road & Track concluded that it was no longer <b>fun</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> be worth that much money. They blamed it on minor suspension changes. Much more likely, the change in weight distribution was at fault. The Jensen Healey was a rather low and wide fairly expensive sports car, but the specifications of its suspension were not particularly impressive, having a solid rear axle. Unlike the AC Ace, with its double transverse leaf rear suspension and aluminium body, the Jensen Healey could not stand the weight of that high up metal and glass and still earn a premium price for its handling. The changes also included a cast iron exhaust manifold replacing the aluminium one, probably to partly balance the high and far back weight of the top. The factory building was used to build multi-tub truck frames.|$|R

The British television show Fifth Gear (Series 23, Episode 11) compared the Pro_Cee'd GT very favourably to the Megane 265, claiming that although it lacks the outright power of the Megane, it was [...] "still quick" [...] and its chassis balance and control were both matching the Renault in corners.
