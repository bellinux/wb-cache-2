5|$|The {{cladistic}} method (or cladism) {{has emerged}} since the 1960s. In 1958, Julian Huxley {{used the term}} clade. Later, in 1960, Cain and Harrison introduced the term cladistic. The salient feature is arranging taxa in a hierarchical evolutionary tree, ignoring ranks. A taxon is called monophyletic, if it includes all the descendants of an ancestral form. Groups that have descendant groups removed from them (e.g. dinosaurs, with birds as offspring group) are termed paraphyletic, while groups representing more than one branch from {{the tree of life}} are called polyphyletic. The International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature or PhyloCode <b>is</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> regulate the formal naming of clades. Linnaean ranks will be optional under the PhyloCode, which <b>is</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> coexist with the current, rank-based codes.|$|E

5|$|A major {{difference}} from the US Navy tables is that the repetitive group designators represent nitrogen levels in all tissues, unlike the USN table which represent only the 120-minute compartment.

50|$|MCAPI {{provides}} three {{modes of}} communication:1. messages - connection-less datagrams.

Packets <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flexible with respect to payload, providing higher performance than messages {{at the expense of}} configuration effort.3. scalars - connection-oriented, fixed size, uni-directional, and FIFO streams. Scalars <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the highest performance communications mode, albeit at the expense of payload flexibility and configuration effort.|$|R
5|$|Although C# {{applications}} <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> economical {{with regard}} to memory and processing power requirements, the language <b>was</b> not <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> compete directly on performance and size with C or assembly language.|$|R
