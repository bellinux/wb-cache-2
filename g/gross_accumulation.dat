Study Design Prospective, randomized, controlled, crossover in university laboratory. Methods Ex vivo tracheoesophageal prostheses were obtained from university-affiliated speech language pathologists at Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis. Prostheses demonstrating physical integrity and an absence of <b>gross</b> biofilm <b>accumulation</b> were utilized. Sixteen prostheses were cleansed and sterilized prior to random placement by length in two modified Robbins devices arranged in parallel. Each device was seeded with a polymicrobial oral flora on day 1 and received basal artificial salivary flow continuously with three growth medium meals daily. One device was randomly selected for vibratory stimulus, and 2 minutes of vibration was applied to each prosthesis before and after meals for 5 days. The prostheses were explanted and sonicated, and the biofilm cultured for enumeration. This process was repeated after study arm crossover. Results Tracheoesophageal prostheses in the dynamic model receiving vibratory stimulus demonstrated reduced <b>gross</b> biofilm <b>accumulation</b> and a significant biofilm colony forming unit per milliliter reduction of 5. 56 -fold compared to nonvibratory controls (P < 0. 001). Significant reductions were observed within length subgroups. Conclusion Application of vibratory stimulus around meal times significantly reduces biofilm accumulation on tracheoesophageal prostheses in a dynamic in vitro model. Further research using this vibratory stimulus method in vivo {{will be required to}} determine if reduced biofilm accumulation correlates with longer device lifespan...|$|R

40|$|The {{heat-stable}} enterotoxin (ST) of Escherichia coli can {{be detected}} by infant mouse or dog intestinal loop tests. These tests differ in that the dog assay uses concentrated culture supernatants {{and is based on}} measurements of net intestinal absorption, whereas the mouse test uses unconcentrated supernatants and depends on <b>gross</b> fluid <b>accumulation.</b> To compare the relative sensitivities of these assays, culture supernatants of randomly selected E. coli isolates from 34 Bangalee diarrhea patients were tested for ST in dog loops and infant mice. Supernatants were also tested for heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) in dog loops, Y- 1 adrenal cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. E. coli supernatants that produced positive responses for both ST and LT in the dog loop assay (ST+/LT+) also produced positive responses when tested for ST in infant mice and for LT in cell lines. Supernatants of strains negative for ST and LT in dog loop (ST-/LT) were also negative in other assays. Of 10 strains positive for just ST in the dog loop test (ST+/LT-), only 5 were ST positive in the standard infant mouse test. Supernatants of the other five strains (dog loop positive, mouse test negative) were then concentrated 100 -fold and retested in mice. Three of these five gave consistently positive results after concentration, and two were only intermittently positive. Concentrated supernatants of negative control strains (ST-/LT-) were all negative in mice. The dog assay detects more strains producing ST than the infant mouse test. The infant mouse test, which detects only <b>gross</b> fluid <b>accumulation,</b> failed to detect approximately half of the 10 strains which produced ST alone (ST+/LT-; P = 0. 025).

In the article, the problems of a new indicator creation are solved. The attention to the incorrectness of subtraction from gross domestic product is paid, at its ecological adjustment, that part of damage from ecological violations, which makes the under-received income. To avoid the double subtraction of the under-received income, it is necessary to correct gross domestic product only concerning other part of loss — the forced consumption. The big mistake is made at creation of the savings indicator when from <b>gross</b> <b>accumulation</b> is subtracted both the under-received income, and all consumption because of ecological disturbances.

A prototype soil chamber, {{used to make the}} flux measurements, is described and tested by comparing CO 2 flux measurements to a 40 -L chamber, a 1 -m/cu chamber, and eddy correlation. Results suggest that flux measurements with the prototype chamber are consistent with measurements by other methods to within about 20 percent. A simple empirical equation based on 10 -cm soil temperature, 0 - to 10 -cm soil volumetric water content, and leaf area index predicts the soil surface CO 2 flux with a rms error of 1. 2 micro-mol sq m/s for all three sites. Further evidence supports using this equation to evaluate soil surface CO 2 during the 1987 FIFE experiment. The soil surface CO 2 fluxes when averaged over 24 hours are comparable to daily gross canopy photosynthetic rates. For 6 days of data the net daily accumulation of carbon is about 0. 6 g CO 2 sq m/d; this is only a few percent of the daily <b>gross</b> <b>accumulation</b> of carbon by photosynthesis.

40|$|Tissue fibrosis, an {{accumulation}} of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, accompanies cardiac ageing in humans and this is linked to {{an increased risk of}} cardiac failure. The mechanisms driving age-related tissue fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction are unclear, yet clinically important. Drosophila is amenable to the study of cardiac ageing as well as collagen deposition; however it is unclear whether collagen accumulates in the ageing Drosophila heart. This work examined collagen deposition and cardiac function in ageing Drosophila, in the context of reduced expression of collagen-interacting protein SPARC (Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine) an evolutionarily conserved protein linked with fibrosis. Heart function was measured using high frame rate videomicroscopy. Collagen deposition was monitored using a fluorescently-tagged collagen IV reporter (encoded by the Viking gene) and staining of the cardiac collagen, Pericardin. The Drosophila heart accumulated collagen IV and Pericardin as flies aged. Associated with this was a decline in cardiac function. SPARC heterozygous flies lived longer than controls and showed little to no age-related cardiac dysfunction. As flies of both genotypes aged, cardiac levels of collagen IV (Viking) and Pericardin increased similarly. Over-expression of SPARC caused cardiomyopathy and increased Pericardin deposition. The findings demonstrate that, like humans, the Drosophila heart develops a fibrosis-like phenotype as it ages. Although having no gross impact on collagen accumulation, reduced SPARC expression extended Drosophila lifespan and cardiac health span. It is proposed that cardiac fibrosis in humans may develop due to the activation of conserved mechanisms and that SPARC may mediate cardiac ageing by mechanisms more subtle than <b>gross</b> <b>accumulation</b> of collagen...|$|E
40|$|Warburg Micro {{syndrome}} is a severe autosomal recessive condition characterised by abnormalities affecting the ocular, neurological and endocrine systems. Previous studies have identified causative loss-of-function mutations in {{four members of}} the RAB protein network; RAB 3 GAP 1, RAB 3 GAP 2, RAB 18 and TBC 1 D 20, causing clinically indistinguishable phenotypes. RAB 3 GAP 1 and RAB 3 GAP 2 form a heterodimeric complex specifically regulating the RAB 3 family of proteins in calcium mediated exocytosis of hormones and neurotransmitters. Rab 3 gap 1 deficient mice have previously been generated and showed altered short term plasticity in the hippocampus and inhibition of Ca 2 + mediated exocytosis of glutamate from cortical synaptosomes, but failed to recapitulate the characteristic ocular or neurological features of Warburg Micro syndrome. Mutations in TBC 1 D 20, a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for the RAB 1 family, have recently been identified in Warburg Micro syndrome patients and the bs (blind sterile) mouse model; although this model recapitulated many ocular and endocrine abnormalities of the disease any neurological abnormalities have yet to be reported. The function and localisation of RAB 18 remains to be fully elucidated and its role in disease pathogenesis is still unclear. Initially, I have confirmed previous reports co-localising RAB 18 with the cis-Golgi, ER and lipid droplets in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and identified a novel localisation in neuronal processes of primary hippocampal neurons. To examine the role of RAB 18 in vivo a novel Rab 18 genetrap mouse was generated by MRC Harwell as part of the EUMODIC screen. In this study I describe detailed histopathological and neurological characterisation of the Rab 18 -/- mouse model. Rab 18 -/- mice were viable and fertile. At eye opening they presented with dense nuclear congenital cataracts and atonic pupils recapitulating major ocular features of Warburg Micro syndrome. Analysis of embryonic eye development revealed a delay in lens development in Rab 18 -/- mice as early as embryonic day 12. 5. From three weeks of age Rab 18 -/- mice developed progressive hind limb weakness indicative of neurological dysfunction. I have undertaken detailed neuropathological analysis of the observed hind limb weakness and identified no abnormalities in synaptic vesicle recycling and no atrophy of peripheral muscles or aberrant development or stability of neuromuscular connectivity. However, loss of RAB 18 resulted in <b>gross</b> <b>accumulations</b> of neurofilament and microtubule proteins at the neuromuscular junction and disorganisation of the cytoskeleton in peripheral nerves. Investigation of global proteomic profiling in peripheral nerve of Rab 18 -/- mice identified alterations in core pathways regulating the axonal cytoskeleton in neurons.

I highlight a novel mechanistic insight into Warburg Micro syndrome disease pathogenesis and a role for RAB 18 in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics in neurons...|$|R
40|$|What is {{the meaning}} of the {{proposition}} that the law applies to the Internet? The current article examines this proposition in relation to criminal law and to the widespread problems of malware and sexual abuse material of children (child pornography). These problems bear the marks of perpetuity and <b>gross</b> worldwide <b>accumulation</b> due to the computer’s capacity for making duplicate files. There is a gap between the aims of the proposition and its current enforcement. If judicial enforcement of criminal law is limited to personal sanctions, e. g., imprisonment or a fine, then digital contraband falls outside the enforceable scope of the law. Given that criminal law already allows the application of sanctions to objects, for instance by confiscation of assets and contraband, one may envisage the application of these confiscation rules to illegal computer files, thus treating them as objects within the meaning of the law. The rules of confiscation thereby provide a legal basis for the filtering of illegal content on the Internet. This means that the criminal law can be enforced with practical effect to digital contraband within the ordinary framework of judicial review and fair trial. The filters required for enforcement can be implemented by national internet service providers. Furthermore, records containing the identity of each confiscated duplicate file can be swiftly shared between law enforcement agencies internationally, and deployed in national filters based on harmonized rules of criminal law. The end result is an enhanced and internationally concerted effort to discontinue gross violations of the privacy of victims displayed on sexually illicit material. This enforcement approach would be less effective against malware, however, due to the extensive time required for investigation and prosecution. In conclusion, application of the rules of confiscation with a view to subsequent international cooperation against digital contraband exploits the benefits of a harmonized criminal law without jeopardizing the fundamental rights of the individual...|$|R

30|$|People, {{mainly from}} the lower middle and middle class, used to rear buffaloes and cows {{extensively}} for milk and dung. A few also keep sheep and goat and those from the lower class rear pigs. The ban on grazing in the KNP {{has led to a}} fall in livestock population, especially of those free-ranging ones. Ecologically a wetland is a transition ecosystem and it is also the most productive ecosystem. The high biomass production has to be removed by appropriate consumers to maintain the ecological quality of a wetland. In KNP, the livestock especially buffalos from nearby villages served this purpose. Currently, the number of mammalian consumers in the KNP is low, leading to <b>gross</b> <b>accumulation</b> of biomass. On an average, a buffalo removes 20 – 28  kg of wet biomass. It also tramples and churns the wetland and cause the formation of submerged tracks for fishes and open water for water birds (Gulickx et al. 2007). Herbivores are selective feeders (Middleton, 1999); hence, increase the heterogeneity of wetlands. Thus, removal of buffaloes had serious repercussion on the ecology of the KNP in terms of biomass accumulation, reduction in open water area and an overall reduction in the heterogeneity of habitats. For the villagers, besides the dearth of fodder and pastureland, the scarcity of water since the last decade made maintaining livestock difficult. They perceive well that livestock improved their economy as well as the biodiversity in the surroundings. Many villagers judge that livestock provided ecosystem (provisioning) services to birds, for species such as Painted Stork, Asian Openbill stork, Black-headed Ibis, Glossy Ibis, Eurasian Spoonbill, Indian Cormorant and Little Cormorant feed on organisms growing in the churned-up wetlands and offered open-water habitats for waterfowl especially diving and dabbling ducks.|$|E

DNA was extracted from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes from patients with megaloblastic anemia resulting from vitamin B 12 or folate deficiency after pulse-labeling the cells with [3 H]thymidine for 5 min and chasing in unlabeled medium for 24 h. No <b>gross</b> <b>accumulation</b> of partially single-stranded material was observed in the DNA of these cells when compared with DNA from similarly labeled control cells obtained by the addition of 5 -formyl tetrahydrofolic acid to the culture medium. When DNA from lymphocytes labeled with a 5 -min pulse of [3 H]thymidine and sheared to fragments of an average length of 18 micrometer was chromatographed on benzoylated naphthoylated DEAE-cellulose, approximately 80 % of the label was recovered in the partially single-stranded fraction. After chasing in unlabeled medium the label was progressively transferred to the double-stranded fraction over a period of 2 [...] 3 h. The rate of transfer was slower in megaloblastic lymphocytes than in controls. The difference in rate suggested a slower rate of replication fork movement in megaloblastic lymphocytes and so the density shift technique of Painter and schaeffer (J. Mol. Biol. 45 : 467 [...] 479, 1969) was used to measure the fork rate directly. [3 H]Deoxycytidine was used as the labeled nucleoside to avoid possible complications arising from [3 H]thymidine labeling of megaloblastic cells. Investigations on the lymphocytes from four patients showed that the replication fork rate in vitamin-treated control lyphocytes was about 1 micrometer/min. The fork rates in the corresponding untreated cells were invariably lower and rates ranging from 40 to 92 % of those of controls were observed. Normal lymphocytes treated with the deoxynucleotide pool-depleting drugs methotrexate or hydroxyurea displayed defects in DNA synthesis similar to those of untreated megaloblastic lymphocytes. We propose that the delayed DNA replication fork movement in cells of patients with megaloblastic anemia results from impaired biosynthesis of DNA precursors...|$|E

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The Greenland ice sheet {{is treated as}} a monomineralic rock formation, primarily metamorphic, but with a sedimentary veneer of snow and firn. This sedimentary member is perennial above the firn line, and the classical methods of stratigraphy and sedimentation can be profitably applied to it. During a 4 -year period 146 pit studies and 288 supplementary Rammsonde profiles were made along 1100 miles of over-snow traverse (Fig. 1). Temperature, density, ram hardness, and grain size were measured in the strata exposed in each pit. Stratification of snow results from variations in the conditions of deposition and is emphasized by subsequent diagenesis. Summer layers are coarser-grained and have generally lower density and hardness values than winter layers; they may also show evidence of surface melt. The onset of fall is usually identified by an abrupt increase in density and hardness accompanied by a decrease in grain size. This stratigraphic discontinuity is used as the annual reference plane. Strata in the upper 10 to 20 meters compose a succession of annual sequences which are preserved in recognizable form for at least several decades. Correlation of annual layers between pits, spaced 10 to 25 miles apart along the traverse of Figure 1, gives a picture of annual accumulation during the past 5 to 20 years for western Greenland between 69 and 77 °N. The control established by these data, together with information from earlier expeditions (primarily those of Koch-Wegener and DeQuervain) and from permanent coastal meteorological stations, {{have been used to}} make a map showing the distribution of <b>gross</b> annual <b>accumulation,</b> essentially the equivalent of annual precipitation, for the entire ice sheet (Fig. 30). In general, the accumulation contours follow the north-south trend of the coast lines, with extremes of less than 10 cm H 2 O in the northeast and more than 90 cm H 2 O per year in the south; the average for the ice sheet is 34 cm H 2 O per year. The zone of maximum precipitation lies close to the coast in two regions, one on the east coast between Angmagssalik and Scoresbysund, the other on the west coast between Upernavik and Thule. In addition to the existence of a useful stratigraphic record four diagenetic facies are recognized on the ice sheet. (1) The ablation facies extends from the outer edge, or terminus, of the glacier to the firn line. The firn line is the highest elevation to which the annual snow cover recedes during the melt season. (2) The soaked facies becomes wet throughout during the melting season and extents from the firn line to the saturation line, i. e., the uppermost limit of complete wetting. The saturation line is the highest altitude at which the 0 °C isothermal surface penetrates to the melt surface of the previous summer. (3) The percolation facies is subjected to localized percolation of melt water from the surface without becoming wet throughout. Percolation can occur in snow and firn of sub-freezing temperatures with only the pipe-like percolation channels being at the melting point. A network of ice glands, lenses, and layers forms when refreezing occurs. This facies extends from the saturation line to the upper limit of surface melting, the dry-snow line. Negligible soaking and percolation occur above the dry-snow line. (4) The dry-snow facies includes all of the glacier lying above the dry-snow line, and negligible melting occurs in it. The saturation line can be identified by discontinuities in temperature, density, and ram hardness data, and it may also be located by examination of melt evidence in strata exposed on pit walls. It is as sharply defined as the firn line; but the dry-snow line, although determined by the same methods, is an ill-defined transition zone 10 - to 20 -miles wide. The facies represent a response to climate, therefore changes in the location of facies boundaries may be used as indicators of secular climatic change. Since facies are not restricted to the Greenland ice sheet, they provide the basis for a general classification of glaciers. This "facies classification" is areal in nature and gives a greater resolution of characteristics than Ahlmann's "geophysical classification. " In particular, the "facies classification" permits subdivision of large glaciers which span the entire range of environments from temperate to polar. Ahlmann's useful distinction between temperate and polar glaciers takes on new meaning in the light of glacier facies. Thus, a temperate glacier exhibits only the two facies below the saturation line whereas {{one or both of the}} facies above the saturation line are present on polar glaciers. An attempt has been made to map the distribution of facies on the Greenland ice sheet (Fig. 48). The distribution of mean annual temperature on the ice sheet may be approximated by gradients with respect to altitude and latitude of 1 °C/ 100 m and 1 °C per degree latitude respectively. The altitude gradient is controlled by strong outgoing radiation, producing deep inversions and katabatic winds. The katabatic winds are warmed adiabatically as they descend along the surface of the ice sheets and this is the primary control determining the temperature gradient along the snow surface. The latitude gradient is based on temperature measurements made above 2000 m on the ice sheets and on average values from meteorological stations spanning 20 ° of latitude on the west coast. A contour map of isotherms based on these gradients compares well with temperature values obtained from pits on the ice sheet. (Fig. 40). The densification of snow and firn is discussed for the case where melting is negligible. The assumption is that accumulation remains constant at a given location and, under this assumption, the depth-density curve is invariant with time as stated by Sorge's law. As a layer is buried it moves through a pressure gradient under steady-state conditions, and it is assumed that the decrease in pore space with increasing load is simply proportional to the pore spaces, i. e., [ [...] . ] where [ [...] . ] = specific volume of firn ([ [...] . ] = firn density), [ [...] . ] = specific volume of ice = 1. 09 cm 3 /g, [ [...] . ] = load at depth z below the snow surface and m = a constant which depends on the mechanism of densification. The depth-density equation obtained from equation 8 is [ [...] . ] where K = [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ] = void ratio for snow of density [ [...] . ], and [ [...] . ] = void ratio for snow of density [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ] = density of snow when [ [...] . ] = 0. The consequences of the assumption in equation 8 compare favorably with observation. A fundamental change in the mechanism of densification is recognized within 10 m of the snow surface. The concept of a "critical density" is introduced. Before the density of snow attains the critical value it is compacted primarily by packing of the grains. The critical density represents the maximum value obtainable by packing and further compaction must proceed by other mechanisms. The rate of change of volume with increasing load decreases by a factor of 4 when the critical density is exceeded. The same equations hold in the case where melt is not negligible but the rates of densification are higher. Bauer's (1955) estimate for the balance of the ice sheet is revised. Two corrections are applied: (1) the average annual accumulation value of 31 cm H 2 O originally estimated by Loewe (1936) is revised to 34 cm H 2 O as a result of this study; (2) the relative areas of ablation and accumulation zones in Greenland north of 76 °N are more accurately defined. The net result is a slightly positive balance which is interpreted to mean that the Greenland ice sheet is essentially in equilibrium with present day climate...|$|R
