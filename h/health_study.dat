5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' <b>Health</b> <b>Study</b> (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's <b>Health</b> <b>Study.</b>|$|E

25|$|Some {{researchers}} have thrown {{into question the}} entire claimed connection between natural saturated fat consumption and cardiovascular disease.

After accumulating approximately 8 years of data on the diet and health of 49,000 post-menopausal American women, the researchers found that the balance of saturated versus unsaturated fats did not appear to affect heart disease risk, whereas the consumption of trans fat was associated with significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, a Columbia University Mailman School of Public <b>Health</b> <b>study</b> {{examining}} {{the effects of}} institutional discrimination on the psychiatric health of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals found an increase in psychiatric disorders, including a more than doubling of anxiety disorders, among the LGB population living in states that instituted bans on same-sex marriage. According to the author, the study highlighted the importance of abolishing institutional forms of discrimination, including those leading to disparities {{in the mental health}} and well-being of LGB individuals. Institutional discrimination is characterized by societal-level conditions that limit the opportunities and access to resources by socially disadvantaged groups.|$|E
25|$|An {{experiment}} {{designed with}} a large sample and conducted by NIH-AARP Diet and <b>Health</b> <b>Study</b> studied the correlation between fiber intake and colorectal cancer. The analytic cohort consisted of 291,988 men and 197,623 women aged 50–71 years. Diet was assessed with a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire at baseline in 1995–1996; 2,974 incident colorectal cancer cases were identified during five years of follow-up. The result was that total fiber intake {{was not associated with}} colorectal cancer. But on the other hand, the analyses of fiber from different food sources showed that fiber from grains was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer.|$|E
25|$|Cancer, {{the most}} common being hemangiosarcoma, {{followed}} by lymphosarcoma, mast cell tumour, and osteosarcoma, {{was the cause of}} death for 61.4% of American Goldens according to a 1998 <b>health</b> <b>study</b> conducted by the Golden Retriever Club of America, making it the breed's biggest killer. A 2004 survey by the UK Kennel Club puts this number at 38.8%. Although most puppies are screened for the disorders before being sold (by reputable breeders), hip and elbow dysplasia afflict one-fifth of dogs. Eye diseases are also possible in the breed; cataracts are {{the most common}} eye disease, but they can also be afflicted with progressive retinal atrophy, glaucoma, distichiasis, entropion, corneal dystrophy, and retinal dysplasia.|$|E

40|$|Communities with {{environmental}} health {{concerns in the}} USA frequently request studies from their local or state departments of public health. This paper presents findings from three focus groups conducted in communities north of Boston {{that have been the}} subject of two different environmental <b>health</b> <b>studies.</b> The focus groups were designed to elicit residents' perceptions of environmental health, and of the particular studies conducted in their communities. In all focus groups, participants had difficulty accepting the findings of <b>health</b> <b>studies</b> that contradicted their own experiences of environmental exposures and illness. Our results suggest that lay knowledge, informed in varying degrees by the experience of what we term "tangible evidence," creates a lens through which communities interpret a <b>health</b> <b>study's</b> findings. The differences in reliance on tangible evidence were related to participants' sense of trust in public officials, and the institutions responsible for conducting <b>health</b> <b>studies.</b> Participants from the wealthier, predominantly white communities discussed trust in study design and methodologies used. In contrast, participants from the lower-income, higher-minority communities assessed <b>health</b> <b>studies</b> with reference to their trust (or lack thereof) in study sponsors and public health institutions. Participants' experience of tangible evidence, trust or distrust in health agencies and research institutions, and a sense of relative community power, influence how they assess the findings of environmental <b>health</b> <b>studies</b> and may have implications for pubic health.
