25|$|Podzolized, brunisolic, luvisolic, gleysolic, and regosolic (immature) {{soils are}} typical of those {{supporting}} white spruce throughout {{the range of the}} species (Nienstaedt 1957). Soils supporting white spruce are most commonly Alfisols or Inceptisols (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). In the podzol region of Wisconsin, white spruce occurs on loam podzols, podzolized gley loams, strongly podzolized clays, gley-podzol clays, stream-bottom soils, and wood peat (Wilde et al. 1949). Moist sandy loams also support <b>good</b> <b>growth</b> (Harlow and Harrar 1950). On sandy podzols (Wilde et al. 1949), it is usually a minor species (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Good development occurs on moist alluvium (Seeley, cited by Nienstaedt 1957; Jeffrey 1961, 1964; Lacate et al. 1965; Viereck 1973) on the banks of streams and borders of swamps (Sargent 1898, Kenety 1917, Rowe 1972). White spruce makes <b>good</b> <b>growth</b> on well-drained lacustrine soils in Alberta Mixedwoods (Heger 1971), on moderately-well-drained clay loams in Saskatchewan (Kabzems 1971), and on melanized loams and clays (with sparse litter and a dark-coloured organically-enriched mineral horizon) in the Algoma district of Ontario (Wilde et al. 1954).|$|E

In good oak, these large vessels of the earlywood occupy from 6 to 10 percent of the volume of the log, while in inferior material they may make up 25% or more. The latewood of good oak is dark colored and firm, and consists mostly of thick-walled fibers which form one-half or more of the wood. In inferior oak, this latewood is much reduced both in quantity and quality. Such variation is very largely the result of rate of growth.|$|E

25|$|On dry, deep, outwash {{deposits}} in northern Ontario, both white spruce and aspen grow slowly (MacLean 1960). But, broadly, white spruce {{is able to}} tolerate considerable droughtiness of sites that are fertile, and no fertile site is too moist unless soil moisture is stagnant (Sutton 1968). Soil fertility holds the key not just to white spruce growth but to {{the distribution of the}} species. At least moderate fertility is needed for <b>good</b> <b>growth,</b> but white spruce occurs on many sites where nutrient deficiencies depress its growth more than that of black spruce, red spruce, Norway spruce, and the pines generally (Heiberg and White 1951, Lafond 1954, McLeod 1956, MacArthur 1957, Paine 1960, Swan 1960). Minimum soil-fertility standards recommended for white spruce sufficient to produce 126 to 157nbsp&m3/ha of wood at 40 years are much higher than for pine species commonly planted in the Lake States (Wilde 1966): 3.5% organic matter, 12.0 meq/100 g exchange capacity, 0.12% total N, 44.8nbsp&kg/ha available P, 145.7nbsp&kg/ha available K, 3.00 meq/100 g exchangeable Ca, and 0.70 meq/100 g exchangeable Mg.|$|E
25|$|A {{biological}} {{survey was}} carried out in 1993, near Rother Valley Country Park, and only seven types of invertebrates were found, all of which were highly tolerant to pollution. It was recognised that the straight engineered channel where the river had been re-instated after coal mining was not well suited to the support of life, and so a stone weir was constructed, to help with natural aeration of the water, and to increase the flow velocity so that the gravel below the weir was scoured clean. A bay was constructed above the weir, where fish could escape when the river was affected by flooding or pollution incidents. A trial release of fish, funded by contributions from Rhone Poulenc, Coalite Chemicals and Yorkshire Water, was made in April 1994. Half of the total of 2,500 chub and 2,500 roach were released near the new weir, and the other half at Hall Road in Staveley. It soon became clear from anglers that the fish were spreading along the river, and a further 40,000 fish were released that winter. Another survey in September 1995 revealed <b>good</b> <b>growth</b> rates in the fish, and barbel were thriving. Brown trout, thought to have come from the River Hipper or the Barlow Brook, were also found in the Rother, and since these are much less tolerant to organic pollution and low oxygen levels, were a clear indicator that conditions were improving. The following year, chub and dace were released at Old Whittington, and clear evidence that the fish were breeding in the river was found. The river had become a self-sustaining fishery again, and organised angling began {{for the first time in}} over 100 years.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{analysis}} of networking activities among SME exporters in regional NSW, Australia indicates that {{they tended to}} be isolated entrepreneurs, who relied primarily on their internal innovation and marketing capacities rather than on local networks and clusters as suggested by regional development theory (Vaessen and Keeble, 1995). Many of these firms were small, new ‘born global’ firms that had entered world markets with an innovative niche product and helped by the very low Australian exchange rates prevailing at that time. To be a successful exporter, the small firm must acquire sufficient resources to cover the higher risks of operating in international markets, as well as adopt strategies {{that are consistent with}} prevailing market conditions. In this study, SME exporters are divided into four categories based on their growth performance between 1996 / 97 and 2000 / 01 : negative, modest, good and fast. Each group is analysed to determine the relationship between their export growth performance and a series of market orientated and internal resource variables. This analysis is performed using logistical equation models, controlling for a number of structural variables. Key findings were that export growth increased in line with export intensity. Fast and <b>good</b> export <b>growth</b> was {{associated with the use of}} partnerships and collaborations and foreign direct investment, while these factors were either insignificant or negative for the other firms. Most of the fast growth firms were new exporters or ‘born global’ and tended to use early stage export strategies, while for the larger <b>good</b> and modest <b>growth</b> firms, introducing equity was positively associated with export growth.

In Serbia, they were also called zmajevit [...] "having a dragon's properties", from zmaj [...] "dragon". The mythological dragon was imagined as a fiery creature with wings, usually having a snake-like shape; he could also {{take the form of}} an eagle or a man. Each dragon had his own territory, within which he dwelt by a forest spring or stream, in the hollow trunk of a beech tree, or in a mountain cave. He was benevolent toward the humans, and he took care that his territory received the right amount of rain at the right time, for <b>good</b> <b>growth</b> of the crops. His arch-enemy was a female demon named ala (plural: ale), whose main activity was to lead storm and hail clouds over fields to destroy crops. The ale also consumed the fertility of the fields. Whenever he noticed an ala approaching, the dragon would fly up into the clouds to fight against the demon and chase her away. He shot fiery arrows and stones at her, which produced lightning and thunder. In the regions where people believed in the zduhaći, the dragon was a highly regarded mythological being, but he was not associated with the crops and their protection from demons. Similar was the case in other than western regions of Bulgaria.|$|E
