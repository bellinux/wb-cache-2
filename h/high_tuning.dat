50|$|Tuning range, tuning {{gain and}} phase noise are the {{important}} {{characteristics of a}} VCO. Generally low phase noise is preferred in the VCO. The noise present in the control signal and the tuning gain affect the phase noise; high noise or <b>high</b> <b>tuning</b> gain imply more phase noise. Other important elements that determine the phase noise are the transistor's flicker noise (1/f noise), the output power level, and the loaded Q of the resonator. (see Leeson's equation). The low frequency flicker noise affects the phase noise because the flicker noise is heterodyned to the oscillator output frequency due to the active devices non-linear transfer function. The effect of flicker noise can be reduced with negative feedback that linearizes the transfer function (for example, emitter degeneration).|$|E

50|$|The {{heads or}} skins used are a batter head (the playing surface {{on the top}} of the drum) and a {{resonant}} (bottom) head. The resonant head is usually much thinner than the batter head and is not beaten while playing. Rather than calfskin, most modern drums use plastic (Mylar) skins of around 10 mils thickness, sometimes with multiple plies (usually two) of around 7 mils for the batter head. In addition, tone control rings or dots can be applied, either on the outer or inner surface of the head, to control overtones and ringing, and can be found positioned in the centre or close to the edge hoops or both. Resonant heads are usually only a few mils thick, to enable them to respond to the movement of the batter head as it is played. Pipe band requirements have led to the development of a Kevlar-based head, enabling very <b>high</b> <b>tuning,</b> thus producing a very high-pitched cracking snare sound.|$|E

40|$|Many {{demanding}} {{high speed}} applications like optical communication operating at 40 - 100 Gb/s and 77 GHz automotive radar require transistors with a cutoff frequency fT of 200 GHz or above. Additionally, these applications also need transistors with high breakdown voltages, {{which are used}} e. g. for ESD protection and driver stages. Furthermore, 77 GHz automotive radar applications require varactors with sufficiently <b>high</b> <b>tuning</b> range to be integrated on the same chip. Such an integration of high voltage transistors and varactors with <b>high</b> <b>tuning</b> range into high frequency SiGe bipolar technologies is challenging due to the requirement of a shallow collector for the high speed transistor. In this work, a novel concept with two epitaxial layers is proposed for the simultaneous integration of high speed transistors, high voltage transistors, and varactors with <b>high</b> <b>tuning</b> range on the same chip. Using this concept, high speed transistors with 209 GHz cut-off frequency have been combined with high voltage transistors providing an emitter-collector breakdown voltage of 5 V. Additionally, the same concept allowed the development and optimization of a varactor for a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) with <b>high</b> <b>tuning</b> range of 13 GHz and sufficiently low phase noise suitable for 77 GHz automotive radar applications. Process and device simulations leading to the optimum device combination, and design considerations related to the process flow, are presented. This work also describes extensive investigations of the emitter, collector, and base for improving the speed of future high speed transistors. As a part of emitter optimization, {{it has been found}} that by using a relatively simple un-doped silicon cap instead of the conventional p-doped silicon cap the cutoff frequency fT increases by 15 GHz (10 %). This is verified by simulation and experiment. Using the double epi concept, the collector thickness of the high speed transistor can be reduced independent from the requirements of the high voltage transistor. A detailed simulation study concerning the collector thickness and doping for achieving high speed is presented as a part of collector optimization. Investigations show that by using a thin collector of 40 nm and a high collector doping of 1. 5 angstroem 10 ^ 18 cm- 3 in the standard high speed transistor an improvement in cutoff frequency of 45 GHz can be achieved. As a result of base optimization, it has been found that the combination of lateral emitter scaling down to 80 nm, a thin emitter-base spacer of 30 nm, high doping of 2 angstroem 10 ^ 20 cm- 3 in the extrinsic base link region, and extending the base contact towards the emitter increases the maximum oscillation frequency fmax of the high speed transistor up to 700 GHz, which means a doubling of the present performance...|$|E
