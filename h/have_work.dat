5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 May, a meeting was held in Southery, Norfolk. The group, {{including}} a Thomas Sindall, marched through Denver to Downham Market {{to meet with the}} magistrates at their weekly meeting at The Crown public house. Sindall was the only person known to have been at both the riots at Downham Market and Littleport. He was killed by troopers at Littleport—see below. The mob of 1,500, mainly men but some women, besieged The Crown until the magistrates agreed to allow a deputation of eight rioters inside to make their pleas: to <b>have</b> <b>work</b> and two-shillings (£) per day. The magistrates acceded to these demands, but they had already called the yeoman cavalry from Upwell, who arrived at 5pm. Backed by the troops, the Riot Act was then read in the market place by Reverend Dering, causing further tussles, which subsided after arrests started to be made.|$|E

25|$|On 14 April 1942 the {{transports}} ended. Henio and {{his father}} survived the selections of spring 1942, apparently thanks to a work permit (J-Ausweiss) that his father had. Along with rest of the Jews who stayed alive in Lublin, they were transferred to another smaller ghetto that was built in Majdan Tatarski (a suburb of Lublin). Between 7,000 and 8,000 people entered this ghetto, although many of them did not <b>have</b> <b>work</b> permits. On 22 April the SS held another selection: about 2,500 to 3,000 people without work permits were taken first to Majdanek {{and from there to}} Krepiec forest which is about 15km from Lublin. There they were shot to death.|$|E
30|$|Most specialists (60  %) {{reported}} {{working with}} FCC providers from 1 to 5  years {{and a third}} (33  %) reported working with providers for 6  years or more. Prior work experience was assessed based on specialists’ reports of their two most recent jobs previous to their current work with providers {{and whether or not}} they <b>had</b> ever <b>worked</b> as a FCC provider. Specialists who themselves <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> as FCC providers or center-based teachers were considered as <b>having</b> <b>worked</b> with children. Specialists who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> as a center director, in an administrative, consulting, or home visiting role were considered as <b>having</b> <b>worked</b> with adults. A majority of specialists (71  %) had prior experience working directly with children. Just over half of participants (52  %) <b>had</b> <b>work</b> experience with both children and adults, while 29  % <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> with adults only and 16  % <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> with children only.

500|$|... "The Dog and Pony Show" [...] was co-written by {{producers}} Robert Borden and Deborah Oppenheimer, {{and directed}} by Steve Zuckerman.

Following its release in the United States, Drew Carey saw the film three times and loved it so much he invited the cast to appear in the episode, while they were promoting the film.

500|$|In early 1849, {{according}} to a letter written by Longacre the following year, the chief engraver was approached {{by a member of}} the Mint staff, warning him that another officer (plainly Peale) sought to have the engraving work done outside of the Mint, making Longacre redundant. [...] The outside engraver in question was Frenchman Louis Bouvet, whom Patterson had prepare a design for the half eagle, though it was not adopted. [...] Longacre's response to the information was to spend much of March 1849 preparing the dies for the gold dollar, at some cost to his health, as he later related. [...] He demanded that Patterson hire assistance for him, but found the director willing only to <b>have</b> <b>work</b> contracted out. [...] Longacre was unwilling to consent to this, as he could not supervise work done outside the Mint (he did get help within the Mint from assistant engraver Peter Filatreu Cross, who worked on the reverse of the gold dollar). [...] Longacre proceeded with work on the double eagle through late 1849, and described the obstacles set in his path by Peale: ...|$|E
500|$|By April, Robert W. Woolley {{had been}} {{commissioned}} as Director of the Mint, and he approved {{samples of the}} gold dollar, the first to <b>have</b> <b>work</b> completed, on April 22. [...] He then traveled to San Francisco, and was there when the dies for the dollar arrived on the 27th. [...] When the San Francisco Mint's coiner examined them, they proved to be lacking the mint mark [...] "S", customary on coins produced there. [...] Woolley was not sure if this was intentional, and wired to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce on the 29th. [...] Upon learning that it was intentional—Joyce reasoned that as the entire mintage of this, the first commemorative issue to be struck outside Philadelphia, would be produced at San Francisco, {{there was no need}} to use a mint mark—Woolley ordered that the dies at San Francisco and in transit be returned to Philadelphia, and new ones produced with the mint mark. [...] Woolley believed that people would assume the coins were struck at Philadelphia, which did not then use a mint mark. Burdette notes that the San Francisco Mint was a source of local pride and the omission of the mint mark would likely have led to widespread protest, and possibly to two varieties of each of the new coins: with mint mark, and without. New dollar dies were sent from Philadelphia on May 3, and for the half dollar the following day. [...] Dies for the $50 followed on May 14, and for the quarter eagle on May 27.|$|E
