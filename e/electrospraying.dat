5000|$|Laser-based electrospray-based ambient {{ionization}} is a {{two-step process}} in which a pulsed laser is used to desorb or ablate material from a sample and the plume of material interacts with an <b>electrospray</b> to create ions. For ambient ionization, the sample material is deposited on a target near the <b>electrospray.</b> The laser desorbs or ablates material from the sample which is ejected from the surface and into the <b>electrospray</b> which produces highly charged ions.

50|$|A Taylor cone {{refers to}} the cone {{observed}} in electrospinning, <b>electrospraying</b> and hydrodynamic spray processes from which a jet of charged particles emanates above a threshold voltage. Aside from electrospray ionization in mass spectrometry, the Taylor cone is important in field-emission electric propulsion (FEEP) and colloid thrusters used in fine control and high efficiency (low power) thrust of spacecraft.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 16th century William Gilbert {{set out to}} {{describe}} the behavior of magnetic and electrostatic phenomena. He observed that when a suitably electrically charged piece of amber was brought near a droplet of water it would form a cone shape and small droplets would be ejected {{from the tip of}} the cone: this is the first recorded observation of <b>electrospraying.</b>|$|E
50|$|When a small {{volume of}} {{electrically}} conductive liquid {{is exposed to}} an electric field, the shape of liquid starts to deform from the shape caused by surface tension alone. As the voltage is increased {{the effect of the}} electric field becomes more prominent. As it approaches exerting a similar amount of force on the droplet as the surface tension does, a cone shape begins to form with convex sides and a rounded tip. This approaches the shape of a cone with a whole angle (width) of 98.6Â°. When a certain threshold voltage has been reached the slightly rounded tip inverts and emits a jet of liquid. This is called a cone-jet and {{is the beginning of the}} <b>electrospraying</b> process in which ions may be transferred to the gas phase. It is generally found that in order to achieve a stable cone-jet a slightly higher than threshold voltage must be used. As the voltage is increased even more, other modes of droplet disintegration are found. The term Taylor cone can specifically refer to the theoretical limit of a perfect cone of exactly the predicted angle or generally refer to the approximately conical portion of a cone-jet after the <b>electrospraying</b> process has begun.|$|E
50|$|Infrared laser {{desorption}} can be {{coupled with}} atmospheric pressure chemical ionization using laser desorption atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (LD-APCI). For ambient ionization with a spray, the sample material is deposited on a target near the spray. The laser desorbs or ablates {{material from the}} sample that is ejected from the surface and into the spray, which can be an APCI spray with a corona discharge or an <b>electrospray.</b> Ambient ionization by electrospray-assisted laser desorption/ionization (ELDI) can be accomplished with ultraviolet and infrared lasers to the desorb material into the <b>electrospray</b> plume. Similar approaches to laser desorption/ablation into an <b>electrospray</b> are matrix-assisted laser desorption <b>electrospray</b> ionization (MALDESI), laser ablation <b>electrospray</b> ionization (LAESI), laser assisted desorption <b>electrospray</b> ionization (LADESI), laser desorption <b>electrospray</b> ionization (LDESI), laser ablation mass spectrometry (LAMS), and laser desorption spray post-ionization (LDSPI).

Device performance comparable to spin-coating was achieved with the <b>electrospray</b> process, which {{can be considered as}} a scalable large-area process alternative. However, the <b>electrospray</b> process requires elaborate choices involving solvents and higher concentrations of hole and electron transport materials in active materials.

5000|$|A {{spinneret}} is {{a device}} used to extrude a polymer solution or polymer melt to form fibers. Streams of viscous polymer exit via the spinneret into air or liquid {{leading to a}} phase inversion which allows the polymer to solidify.

An <b>electrospray</b> {{can be used to}} produce nanometer-scale thin films by electric repulsion of microscale fine droplets. PLED devices made by an <b>electrospray</b> process were compared with spin-coated ones. The PLED device fabricated by the <b>electrospray</b> process showed maximum current efficiency of 24 cd/A, which was comparable with that of the spin-coating process. The <b>electrospray</b> process required a higher concentration of hole and electron transport materials in the inks than spin-coating processes to achieve PLED maximum performance. Photoluminescence [PL] at 407 nm was observed using <b>electrosprayed</b> poly(N-vinyl carbazole) films, whereas a peak at 410 nm was observed with the spin-coated ones. Similar difference in peak position was observed between aromatic and nonaromatic solvents in the spin-coating process. PLED devices made by the <b>electrospray</b> process showed lower current density than that of spin-coated ones. The PL peak shift and reduced current of <b>electrosprayed</b> films can therefore be attributed to the conformation of the polymer.|$|R

A synthetic 20 -mer oligonucleotide annealed to its complementary strand {{was used as a}} model system for initial experiments. <b>Electrospray</b> solutions were altered by varying the relative proportion of aqueous phase in efforts to induce destabilization of the double helix. When the <b>electrospray</b> solution contains a 25 % aqueous content, the 20 -mer oligonucleotide is detected in its double-stranded form. Increasing the proportion of aqueous phase in the <b>electrospray</b> solution to 60 % destabilized the double helix, resulting in the detection of only single-stranded species. This strategy was extended to an 82 -bp polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product derived from the human tyrosine hydroxylase gene (HUMTH 01). In efforts to destabilize the 82 -bp PCR product, <b>electrospray</b> solutions reaching 70 % aqueous content were necessary to promote the detection of only single-stranded amplicons. Implementation of the resistively heated transfer line and an <b>electrospray</b> solution in which the oligonucleotide is on the threshold of duplex stability allowed for double-stranded and single-stranded species to be generated from the same ESI solutions at both ambient and elevated transfer line temperatures, respectively, without disruption of the <b>electrospray</b> process.
