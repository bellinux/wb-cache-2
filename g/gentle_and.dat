Capybaras are <b>gentle</b> <b>and</b> usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them, but physical contact is normally discouraged, as their ticks can be vectors to Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|E
5|$|Rai school sugata {{resembles that}} of the late Heian/early Kamakura period being both <b>gentle</b> <b>and</b> graceful, but grander and with a more {{vigorous}} workmanship. Starting with Kunimitsu, the kissaki becomes larger. The jihada is small-grain mokume-hada, dense with ji-nie, yubashiri and chikei. The quality of the jigane is slightly inferior {{to that of the}} Awataguchi school. The hamon shows medium suguha with chōji midare.|$|E
5|$|Riley wrote <b>gentle</b> <b>and</b> romantic {{poems that}} were not in dialect. They {{generally}} consisted of sonnets and were strongly influenced by the works of John Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. His standard English poetry was never as popular as his Hoosier dialect poems. Still less popular were the poems Riley authored in his later years; most were to commemorate important events of American history and to eulogize the dead.|$|E

5|$|The modern Saluki has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed {{may be difficult}} to train. Training methods should always be <b>gentle</b> <b>and</b> patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Greece itself, {{medicinal}} plants are produced in Italy in Tyrrhenia, as Aeschylus records, and Latium; and in Egypt, which as Homer mentions {{is the source}} of the drug nepenthes that makes men forget sorrow and passion. The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, comes only from Crete. Wolfsbane comes from Crete and Zakynthos; it can be made into a poison that causes death a year or more after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and frankincense are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine makes people <b>gentle</b> <b>and</b> cheerful. Birthwort has many uses including for bruises on the head, snakebite, and prolapse of the uterus.|$|E
5|$|Dogs {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are <b>gentle</b> <b>and</b> easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1857 Burne-Jones joined Morris, Valentine Prinsep, J.R. Spencer Stanhope and others in Rossetti's ill-fated scheme to {{decorate}} {{the walls of the}} Oxford Union. None of the painters had mastered the technique of fresco, and their pictures had begun to peel from the walls before they were completed. In 1859 Burne-Jones made his first journey to Italy. He saw Florence, Pisa, Siena, Venice and other places, and appears to have found the <b>gentle</b> <b>and</b> romantic Sienese more attractive than any other school. Rossetti's influence still persisted, and is visible, more strongly perhaps than ever before, in the two watercolours of 1860, Sidonia von Bork and Clara von Bork. Both paintings illustrate the 1849 gothic novel Sidonia the Sorceress by Lady Wilde, a translation of Sidonia Von Bork: Die Klosterhexe (1847) by Johann Wilhelm Meinhold.|$|E
5|$|The Clumber Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog of the spaniel type, {{developed}} in the United Kingdom. It is {{the largest of the}} spaniels, and comes in predominantly white with either lemon or orange markings, but can sometimes be either brown or lemon predominantly. The name of the breed is taken from Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire where the breed was first developed. It is a gundog that specialises in hunting in heavy cover. They are <b>gentle</b> <b>and</b> loyal, and can act aloof with strangers. They have several habits which could be considered disadvantages, including a constant shedding of its coat and snoring.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord is large, with stallions {{weighing}} {{upwards of}} , and is bred for traction ability and pulling power. The breed {{is found in}} many solid colors, although bay and roan are the most common, and {{is known to be}} <b>gentle</b> <b>and</b> easy to handle. Two slightly different types of Trait du Nord are found – a larger type used for heavier pulling and a lighter type used for faster work. The breed is considered to be endangered by the French government, with fewer than 100 new foal births a year. The national breed registry in France is working with local groups in an attempt to promote this breed and bring population numbers back up. The breed currently has a high risk of inbreeding, due to the low number of breeding stallions, and is at risk of extinction.|$|E

5|$|Mughal-e-Azam takes {{numerous}} liberties {{with historical}} fact. Historian Alex von Tunzelmann {{says that although}} the real Salim was a heavy consumer of alcohol and opium {{from the age of}} 18, he was not necessarily a mischievous boy, as depicted in the film. When the film's Salim returns from his time in the military, he is depicted as a <b>gentle</b> <b>and</b> romantic hero, in contrast to the real Salim, who was documented as a brutal drunk who would often beat people to death. The real Salim did lead a rebellion against his father, tried to replace him as emperor, and had Akbar's friend Abu al-Fazl murdered in 1602, but the film ascribes these actions to his desire to marry Anarkali, which is historically inaccurate. Further, there were also discrepancies in sets, costumes, and music of the film. The Sheesh Mahal, actually the royal bath of the queen, was depicted in the film as a dancing hall, and much larger. Music and dancing styles from the 19th century were depicted, although the story takes place in the 16th century. For example, thumri, a semi-classical music form developed in the 19th century, is adopted in a dance sequence in Kathak style, which is a 16th-century dance form.|$|E
