Surakarta: Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Sebelas Maret University, Juli 2007. PT. Tomoko Daya Perkasa {{is one of}} {{the company}} in a {{metallizing}} industry. The most often material handling equipment using by production division is handlifter. It can be seen at frequency usage of highest material handling appliance for the handlifter. The prime situation from material handling problems, early from less fluent of material intake in floor and in rewindingslitting machine. This matter because of handlifter cannot conducting of material intake which is in form of coil at location in floor and in rewinding machine directly. Other problem at the of conducting of material intake that is in rewinding machine, operator have to use appliance assist. At material intake in floor also there are additional constraint, besides operator have to use the appliance assist, the operator also have to push material to part of lifter. The aim of this research is to overcome constraint that occured in process of material intake using assist previous handling material, so that process material handling can more productive [...] The method is being used in is anthropometry approach. Anthropometry approach is needed to to determine material handling appliance dimension. This research also assess productivity from material handling appliance, use result from material handling simulation model. Simulation model meant as information from material handling condition after conducted redesigning. This research is conducted at material <b>handling</b> <b>operator</b> in PT.

30|$|Nonlinear integer {{programming}} model for dynamic cell formation is developed by Mahdavi et al. (2010) {{to address the}} problem of operator assignment to cells. Improving operator assignment flexibility concurrently with dynamic cell formation is the main feature of the developed model. Multiple attributes are considered in their model as; multi-period production planning, machine duplication, dynamic system reconfiguration, machine capacity, available time of operators and operator assignment. The objective function seeks to minimize eight cost functions namely; holding cost, backorder cost, inter-cell material handling cost, maintenance and overhead cost of machines, machine relocation cost, salary cost, hiring cost and firing cost. Mahdavi et al. (2010) emphasized the need of considering operator-related factors in cell design to achieve expected benefits of cellular layouts. Niakan et al. (2016) introduced a biobjective mathematical model for dynamic cell formation by considering both machine and operator skill levels. Niakan et al. (2016) formulated and validated their model by using theoretical data sets. Sakhaii et al. (2016) developed a robust optimization approach for a mixed-integer linear programming model to obtain solutions for a DCMS with unreliable machines and a production planning problem in a simultaneous manner. Main considerations of their study are DCFP, inter-cell layout, operator assignment problem, unreliable machines, alternative process routes and production planning decisions. Objective function of the mathematical model developed by Sakhaii et al. (2016) sought to minimize the costs of inter- and intra-cell material <b>handling,</b> <b>operator</b> training and hiring, machine relocation, machine breakdowns, inventory holding and backorder. The biobjective stochastic model developed by Zohrevand et al. (2016) addresses human-related problems in DCFP by considering labor utilization, worker overtime cost, worker hiring/laying-off, and worker cell assignment. Their model seeks to minimize the total costs of machine procurement, machine relocation, inter-cell moves, overtime utilization, worker hiring/laying-off, and worker moves between cells while maximizing the labor utilization. The model proposed by Tavakkoli-Moghaddam et al. (2011) is one of the noticeable studies on incorporating human-related factors in cell formation. Their model consists of cell formation problem with two conflicting objectives as; optimizing the labor allocation while maximizing the cell utilization. The developed model is solved using multiobjective particle swarm optimization.|$|E

In {{the context}} of Cousot and Cousot's {{abstract}} interpretation theory, we present a general framework to define, study and <b>handle</b> <b>operators</b> modifying abstract domains. In particular, we introduce the notions of operators of refinement and compression of abstract domains: A refinement enhances the precision of an abstract domain; a compression operator (compressor) can exist relatively to a given refinement, and it simplifies {{as much as possible}} a domain of input for that refinement. The adequateness of our framework is shown by {{the fact that most of}} the existing operators on abstract domains fall in it. A precise relationship of adjunction between refinements and compressors is also given, justifying why compressors can be understood as inverses of refinements...|$|R
