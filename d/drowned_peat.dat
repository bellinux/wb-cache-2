40|$|Throughout history, human {{societies}} dependent upon coastal environments {{have adapted to}} changes in sea level. <b>Drowned</b> <b>peat</b> layers on the North Sea continental shelf contain artifacts of Mesolithic communities that had no alternative than to migrate or drown as sea level rose up to 10 mm a– 1. At the same time, those in western Scotland prospered, as illustrated by analyses of Mesolithic shell middens, when the rate of sea-level rise declined to zero at a mid-Holocene highstand (Shennan et al., 2006). We can explain these contrasts {{by the process of}} glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), which results in variable relative sea-level change around the British Isles. This geological process, driven by the build-up and retreat of the last great ice sheets, continues in and around previously glaciated regions. The combination of contrasting relative sea-level changes around the British Isles and a large database of paleo–sea-level reconstructions provides a rigorous test for quantitative GIA models. These models offer a spatial picture not easily inferred from field research at individual sites. Two studies demonstrate the recent advances: Brooks et al. (2008) and Shennan et al. (2006). Their model predictions show good agreement with the majority of the geological evidence of relative sea-level change since 16 ka B. P., but unlike Shennan and Horton (2002), did not include a map summarizing current rates. The approaches outlined here are applicable to the coastlines of other previously glaciated countries where the processes controlling long-term coastal change, ranging from glacial isostatic adjustment to localized sediment consolidation, are similar to the British Isles (Peltier, 1998; Törnqvist et al., 2008). We also present a map showing our best estimates of current relative sea-level change around the British Isles. ...|$|E

30|$|The lignite samples {{collected}} from Giral lignite field of Barmer basin {{have been subjected}} to petrological investigation. The data generated has been discussed to understand the evolution of the paleomires of these lignites. The present study reveals that these low rank C coals are chiefly composed of huminite group macerals, mainly telohuminite and detrohuminite, while liptinite and inertinite group macerals occur in subordinate amounts. Not much variation in the maceral composition from Seam-I to Seam-VIII has been observed. Barmer lignites are characterized by a very high GI (> 10) and moderate TPI indicating topogenous mire in the basin which was permanently flooded. The GI and TPI values and the petrography-based facies critical models indicate that these lignites originated mostly under wet forest swamp to clastic marsh having telmatic to limno-telmatic conditions with a moderate rate of subsidence and a very slow fall in ground water table. Further, the GWI and VI values are suggestive of mesotrophic to rheotrophic hydrological conditions having the dominance of herbaceous to marginal aquatic vegetation. There were spells of periodic <b>drowning</b> of <b>peat</b> especially during the formation of Seam-VII. Moderately high concentration of calcium in these lignites along with the presence of framboidal pyrite indicate enhanced sulphate-reducing bacterial activity present in carbonate and sulphate-rich waters in the basin during peat formation.|$|R
40|$|Detailed stratigraphic and sedimentologic work {{combined}} with high-resolution radiocarbon dating in an exposure of an upto 12 m thick Holocene succession {{near the town}} of Veurne in West Belgium has shown that filling of the coastal plain at continuous, but decelerating sea-level rise, occurs less smoothly than is usually assumed. Three tidal sequences are distinguished, separated by peat layers, the second peat and the surface peat, respectively. The second peat developed at about 6800 cal BP, after the rate of sea-level rise dropped from 7 m/ka to about 2. 5 m/ka, indicating that sediment supply outran relative sea-level rise. In the excavation, the second <b>peat</b> <b>drowns</b> about 100 yr after it started and is covered by a thin veneer of inter- and supratidal beds, after which low intertidal to subtidal conditions prevailed for more than 1000 pr with no deposition. These 1000 yr stand for a gap of about 2 m sea-level rise. This gap is filled almost instantaneously by an ebb-dominated crevasse splay deposit, in which the daily rhythm of ebb and flood can be recognised in the sediments of the lower part and the fortnightly spring and neap tide alternation in the upper part. Crevassing is also considered important by the eventual flooding of the surface peat which is covered by about 1 m of inter- and supratidal deposits. Chaotic and catastrophic crevasse-splay channels in the surface peat are the precursors of the eventual flooding of the peat. Based on the observations in the excavation it is concluded that the current models of Holocene infill of coastal plains based on cores: often promote a gradualness which in reality dots not exist...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the background of}} five palaeogeographical maps between the Marsdiep and the Weser River, and discusses the natural and anthropogenic processes driving the coastal changes during {{the last part of}} the Holocene. Before 2500 BC, during the first half of the Holocene, tidal basins were formed in the lower lying Pleistocene valley system as a result of the Holocene sea-level rise. The tidal basins were filled during the second half of the Holocene and on the deposits from the Pleistocene in the hinterland large coastal peat bogs developed. These peat bogs were vulnerable and sensitive to marine ingressions when the peat surface subsided due to drainage, compaction and erosion. During the Subatlantic (450 BC to present), the different ingression systems in the coastal area between Marsdiep and Weser had their own histories in timing and evolution. The ingressions were naturally caused by lateral migration of coastal barrier and tidal-inlet systems or by changes in the natural drainage system in the hinterland. From the Late Iron Age onwards, humans started to be the major cause of ingressions. By reclaiming and cultivating the seaward margins of coastal peat bogs, these areas subsided significantly and were flooded by high storm surges. When coastal areas were embanked during the historical period, the situation for the lower lying peat lands became more dramatic. When the sea dikes breached, the peat land was flooded, leading to casualties and huge material damages and loss of land. <b>Drowning</b> of the <b>peat</b> lands of the Jade and Dollard in the 14 th and 15 th centuries are examples of such catastrophes...|$|R
40|$|The intermontane Ipswich Basin, {{which is}} {{situated}} 30 km south-west of Brisbane, contains coal measures {{formed in the}} Late Triassic Epoch following a barren non-depositional period. Coal, tuff, and basalt were deposited along with fluvial dominated sediments. The Ipswich Coal Measures mark the resumption of deposition in eastern Australia after the coal hiatus associated {{with a series of}} intense tectonic activity in Gondwanaland during the Permo-Triassic interval. A transtensional tectonic movement {{at the end of the}} Middle Triassic deformed the Toogalawah Group before extension led to the formation of the Carnian Ipswich Coal Measures in the east. The Ipswich Coal Measures comprise the Brassall and Kholo Subgroups. The Blackstone Formation, which forms the upper unit of the Brassall Subgroup, contains seven major coal seams. The lower unit of the Brassall Subgroup, the Tivoli Formation, consists of sixteen stratigraphically significant coal seams. The typical thickness of the Blackstone Formation is 240 m and the Tivoli Formation is about 500 m. The coal seams of the Ipswich Basin differ considerably from those of other continental Triassic basins. However, the coal geology has previously attracted little academic attention and the remaining exposures of the Ipswich coalfield are rapidly disappearing now that mining has ceased. The primary aim of this project was to study the patterns of coal sedimentation and the response of coal seam characteristics to changing depositional environments. The coal accumulated as a peat-mire in an alluvial plain with meandering channel systems. Two types of peat-mire expansion occurred in the basin. Peat-mire aggradation, which is a replacement of water body by the peatmire, was initiated by tectonic subsidence. This type of peat-mire expansion is known as terrestrialisation. It formed thick but laterally limited coal seams in the basin. Whereas, peat-mire progradation was related to paludification and produced widespread coal accumulation in the basin. The coal seams were separated into three main groups based on the mean seam thickness and aerial distribution of one-meter and four-meter thickness contour intervals. Group 1 seams within the one-meter thickness interval are up to 15, 000 m 2 in area, and seams within the four-meter interval have an aerial extent of up to 10, 000 m 2. Group 1 A contains the oldest seam with numerous intraseam clastic bands and shows a very high thickness to area ratio, which indicates high subsidence rates. Group 1 B seams have moderately high thickness to area ratios. The lower clastic influx and slower subsidence rates favoured peat-mire aggradation. The Group 1 A seam is relatively more widespread in aerial extent than seams from Group 1 B. Group 1 C seams have low mean thicknesses and small areas, suggesting short-lived peat-mires as a result of high clastic influx. Group 2 seams arebetween 15, 000 and 35, 000 m 2 in area within the one-meter interval, and between 5, 000 and 10, 000 m 2 within the four-meter interval. They have moderately high area to thickness ratios, indicating that peat-mire expansion occurred due to progressively shallower accommodation and a rising groundwater table. Group 3 seams, which have aerial extents from 35, 000 to 45, 000 m 2 within the one-meter thickness contour interval and from 10, 000 to 25, 000 m 2 within the four-meter interval, show high aerial extent to thickness ratios. They were deposited in quiet depositional environments that favoured prolonged existence of peat-mires. Group 3 seams are all relatively young whereas most Group 1 seams are relatively old seams. All the major fault systems, F 1, F 2 and F 3, trend northwest-southeast. Apart from the West Ipswich Fault (F 3), the F 1 and F 2 systems are broad Palaeozoic basement structures and thus they may not have had a direct influence on the formation of the much younger coal measures. However, the sedimentation patterns appear to relate to these major fault systems. Depocentres of earlier seams in the Tivoli Formation were restricted to the northern part of the basin, marked by the F 1 system. A major depocentre shift occurred before the end of the deposition of the Tivoli Formation as a result of subsidence in the south that conformed to the F 2 system configuration. The Blackstone Formation depocentres shifted to the east (Depocentre 1) and west (Depocentre 2) simultaneously. This depocentre shift was associated with the flexural subsidence produced by the rejuvenation of the West Ipswich Fault. Coal accumulation mainly occurred in Depocentre 1. Two types of seam splitting occurred in the Ipswich Basin. Sedimentary splitting or autosedimentation was produced by frequent influx of clastic sediments. The fluvial dominant depositional environments created the random distribution of small seam splits. However, the coincidence of seam splits and depocentres found in some of the seams suggests tectonic splitting. Furthermore, the progressive splitting pattern, which displays seam splits overlapping, was associated with continued basin subsidence. The tectonic splitting pattern is more dominant in the Ipswich Basin. Alternating bright bands shown in the brightness profiles are a result of oscillating water cover in the peat-mire. Moderate groundwater level, which was maintained during the development of the peat, reduced the possibility of salinisation and <b>drowning</b> of the <b>peat</b> swamp. On the other hand, a slow continuous rise of the groundwater table, that kept pace with the vertical growth of peat, prevented excessive oxidation of peat. Ipswich coal is bright due to its high vitrinite content. The cutinite content is also high because the dominant flora was pteridosperms of Dicroidium assemblage containing waxy and thick cuticles. Petrographic study revealed that the depositional environment was telmatic with bog forest formed under ombrotrophic to mesotrophic hydrological conditions. The high preservation of woody or structured macerals such as telovitrinite and semifusinite indicates that coal is autochthonous. The high mineral matter content in coal is possibly due to the frequent influx of clastic and volcanic sediments. The Ipswich Basin is part of a much larger Triassic basin extending to Nymboida in New South Wales. Little is known of the coal as it lacks exposures. It is apparently thin to absent except in places like Ipswich and Nymboida. This study suggests that the dominant control on depocentres of thick coal at Ipswich has been the tectonism. Fluvial incursions and volcanism were superimposed on this...|$|R
