40|$|Abstract: Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) H 5 N 1 virus persists in Asia, posing {{a threat to}} poultry, wild birds, and humans. Previous work in Southeast Asia demonstrated that HPAI H 5 N 1 risk is related to domestic ducks and people. Other studies discussed the role of migratory birds in the long distance spread of HPAI H 5 N 1. However, the interplay between local persistence and long-distance dispersal has never been studied. We expand previous <b>geospatial</b> risk <b>analysis</b> to include South and Southeast Asia, and integrate the analysis with migration data of satellite-tracked wild waterfowl along the Central Asia flyway. We find that the population of domestic duck is the main factor delineating areas at risk of HPAI H 5 N 1 spread in domesti...|$|R

By joining isochrones with other databases, various kinds of <b>geospatial</b> reachability <b>analysis</b> can be performed, such as how well is a city covered by public services or {{where to look for}} an apartment at moderate prices that is close to the working place.
