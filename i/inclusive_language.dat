40|$|Although it {{is known}} that leaders can have a strong impact on whether {{employees}} voice work-related ideas or concerns, no research has investigated the impact of leader language on voice—particularly in professionally diverse contexts. Based on a social identity approach as well as on collectivistic leadership theories, we distinguish between implicit (i. e., First-Person Plural pronouns) and explicit (i. e., invitations and appreciations) <b>inclusive</b> leader <b>language</b> and test its effects on voice in multi-professional teams. We hypothesized that implicit <b>inclusive</b> leader <b>language</b> promotes voice especially among team members sharing the same professional group membership as the leader (in-group team members) while explicit <b>inclusive</b> leader <b>language</b> promotes voice especially among team members belonging to a different professional group (out-group team members). These hypotheses were tested in a field setting in which 126 health care professionals (i. e., nurses, resident and attending physicians), organized in 26 teams, managed medical emergencies. Behavioral coding and leader language analyses supported our hypotheses: Leaders' “WE”-references were more strongly related to residents' (in-group) and explicit invitations related more strongly to nurses' (out-group) voice behavior. We discuss how <b>inclusive</b> leader <b>language</b> promotes employee voice and explain why group membership functions as an important moderator in professionally diverse teams...|$|R
40|$|Educational {{systems of}} most European {{countries}} {{seem to be}} unable to respond adequately to the growing migration-induced multilingualism. None of the European member states has developed an integrated approach to address linguistic diversity in teacher education programmes that will respond {{to the demands of}} inclusion, equity, and social justice for all learners. This paper presents a European proposal for a second language teacher education curriculum and the process of its adaptation for the Portuguese context. This curriculum intends to prepare content teachers to work with immigrant pupils in mainstream classrooms with a focus on academic language. After the contextualization of the issue of social and linguistic needs of these immigrant students, the authors present a brief overview of the European project curriculum for <b>Inclusive</b> Academic <b>Language</b> Teaching, followed by a discussion of the Portuguese proposal and its implementation caveats. The authors propose a module on Portuguese as a Non-Native Language (PNN L), which covers the issues of second language acquisition in the schooling project, didactical issues of teaching and learning (<b>inclusive)</b> academic <b>language,</b> <b>inclusive</b> academic <b>language</b> and school organization issues. A national proposal for Portugal also embraces the concept of the teacher as a critical reflective practitioner and of school as a learning community. The authors conclude that this European proposal responds to pressing necessities in Portugal for the education of these students and constitutes a viable response to their language needs, in spite of the many constraints in its application...|$|R

The paper considers pedagogical implications and concludes with suggestions for an <b>inclusive</b> SIHRM <b>language.</b> A major aspect of international management is based {{in the field of}} strategic international human resource management (SIHRM) [Schuler, Dowling & De Cieri, 1993; Taylor, Beechler & Napier, 1996], which is essentially focused on strategic human resource management in multinational enterprises (MNEs).
