500|$|A {{streaming}} free {{live performance}} was hosted by iTunes on 9 February 2012. McCartney performed live from Capitol Studios in Los Angeles, {{where much of}} the album was recorded. People tuned into the show by accessing iTunes on their PCs or Macintosh computers. The live performance was later released, as Paul McCartney's Live Kisses, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, airing on PBS' Great Performances in September 2012. The performance was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 13 November 2012. In an interview with Billboard, McCartney said that he didn't rule out the possibility of a tour of the album with the musicians who played on it: [...] "We haven't really talked about it yet. People have plenty of ideas and suggestions. I'd like to see how it goes live, just how much we enjoy it. If we all enjoy it, then we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about taking it out." ...|$|E
500|$|Bannon did not {{outwardly}} advertise {{the fact}} that the books had been released again in her department at Sacramento State. Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: [...] "I was jet-propelled out of the closet. People stared at me around campus, and the PE majors all waved. My chairman told me to put the books into my promotion file, and one of my colleagues told me my file {{was the only one that}} was any fun." [...] She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. She said of the rediscovery, [...] "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life. It had seemed to me, up to that point, that not only had the books and the characters died, so had Ann Bannon." [...] However, following a bitter divorce, and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released, Bannon endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, which she connects to repressing herself for so long. [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that it's connected, somehow. At the time I denied it fiercely, but I really think I beat myself up horribly, in ways I'll never know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{chose to}} save Samantha and {{eliminate}} Rachel, although he expressed severe disappointment with the result, saying [...] "Last night Cameron and I were both {{saying that we}} thought both of you would be fantastic Nancys and now here am I faced with this. But I've {{got to make a}} decision and I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of where the show ultimately for Cameron is going to go and I think I have to go with you Samantha.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{never do}} speak to anybody,' said Marie. 'I have <b>got</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of {{instead of talking}} to the people. How would the things go, if I took to talking to the people, and left everything to that little goose, Peter? Uncle Michel is unreasonable,--and unkind.' ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1999, Forsyth {{published}} The Phantom of Manhattan, {{a sequel}} to The Phantom of the Opera. It {{was intended as a}} departure from his usual genre; Forsyth's explanation was that [...] "I had done mercenaries, assassins, Nazis, murderers, terrorists, special forces soldiers, fighter pilots, you name it, and I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> could I actually write about the human heart?" [...] However, it did not achieve the same success as his other novels, and he subsequently returned to modern-day thrillers.|$|E
2500|$|Fox Atomic {{stated in}} June 2007 {{that they would}} {{consider}} producing a third film if DVD sales of the film did well. In July 2007, while promoting Sunshine, Boyle {{said he had a}} possible story for the next film. [...] "There is an idea for the next one, something which would move the story on. I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it, whether it's right or not." [...] In October 2010, when Alex Garland was asked what was happening with 28 Months Later, he declared: [...] "I'll answer that completely honestly. When we made 28 Days Later, the rights were frozen between {{a group of people who}} are no longer talking to each other. And so, the film is never going to happen unless those people start talking to each other again. There is no script as far as I'm aware." [...] In January 2011, Danny Boyle said, [...] "There is a good idea for it, and once I've got [...] Frankenstein open, I'll begin to think about it a bit more." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the 2006 U.S. Open, {{played on}} the West course of the Winged Foot Golf Club, Montgomerie had yet another chance to win his first major championship. He {{stood in the middle}} of the 18th fairway in the final round having sunk a 50-foot birdie putt on the 17th green, which put him in the joint lead with Phil Mickelson. While waiting in {{position}} on the 18th fairway for the group in front to finish, Montgomerie switched his club from a 6-iron to a 7-iron, assuming adrenaline would kick in. Once the wait was over, he hit the approach shot poorly, ending up short and right of the green, in thick rough. He pitched onto the green, and then three-putted from 30 feet to lose the tournament by one stroke. After the loss, Montgomerie said, [...] "At my age I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> positively. I'm 43 next week, and it's nice I can come back to this tournament and do well again, and I look forward to coming back here again next year and trying another U.S. Open disaster." [...] Geoff Ogilvy won the championship.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, lass," [...] Jack said, [...] "if {{hard work}} can do it, I will; {{but it does}} more nor that. If a man knows things and loves reading it makes him {{different}} like, he's <b>got</b> summat <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about and talk about and care for beside public-houses and dorgs. Canst read, Nell?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's so {{nice of you}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of me, Sam, when you've <b>got</b> so much <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{about on}} poor Songbird's account," [...] said Grace, as they were {{speeding}} out of the seminary grounds. [...] "How is he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much! I've <b>got</b> {{other things}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about. Don't forget that I expect next month {{to take that}} {{examination}} in civil engineering. That's what is on my mind just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{know what}} she thinks of me yet, but I do know very well what she's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of me. She's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> all the world of me--if I break every limb of my body making her do it.|$|E
6000|$|WILLIS, after a {{thoughtful}} silence: 'Oh, it isn't THAT you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{of the old}} gentleman's sense of injury and outrage. Didn't you hear what he said--that he would have handed over his dearest friend, his own brother, to the police?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come! You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{of me in}} {{this matter}} {{as well as of}} yourself. No playing fast and loose with the arrangements. Understand?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Powers made {{a speech}} {{about the death of}} British wrestling veteran and TV actor [...] "Bomber" [...] Pat Roach and the request to play the British {{national}} anthem before the main event <b>got</b> fans <b>to</b> <b>think</b> they were seeing a different side to Powers, or so they were to believe as no one was expecting the following events.|$|R
6000|$|... "Make it think! Hasn't it <b>got</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about? Aren't there ten {{thousand}} penny-a-liners, poets, tragedians, tub-thumpers, long-eared philosophers, boring it to death? Who {{are you to}} turn up your nose at your work and tell the Almighty His own business? You are here to make us laugh. Get on with your work, you confounded young idiot!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is all right," [...] said Mr. Turnbull. [...] "That’s {{just the}} bare idea I’ve given you. It’s {{for you to}} improve upon it. You’ve <b>got</b> two days <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it." ...|$|R
60|$|HUNTINGDON. And you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the girls. Any trouble {{would be}} very beastly for them. And the poor old Governor would feel it awfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "But look here, Governor," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{of other}} things than your riots in Europe. You've fired on our flag." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the same}} I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about him. There's {{a dozen or}} so of men as would marry me, Mr. Moggs; but I can never have another father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my nature's {{not like}} yours. To {{come to the}} point, I want to sell my ships and retire. I need rest. Freights are very depressed. I've <b>got</b> my family <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think it's a {{proof of}} both," [...] replied Polly, with a blush and a laugh; [...] "we have <b>got</b> the power <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and speak and reason, {{and we are}} {{sometimes}} very naughty." ...|$|R
50|$|Sena had a {{background}} in pharmacology and his day job consisted of testing mitochondria with various drugs their ability to convert fatty acids into energy. A television documentary he viewed <b>got</b> him <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{about the idea that}} the mitochondria had a will of its own and did not feel like keeping itself up with the end of its symbiotic relationship.|$|R
6000|$|... "Course I {{believe in}} it on principle, but I don't propose to have anybody telling me what I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and do. No American 'll ever stand for that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh ho!" [...] Forrest {{laughed in}} appreciation. [...] "Oh Joy is a josher. A good name, but it won't do. There is the Missus. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> another name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Can’t be helped,” {{he said in}} a tone of gloomy sympathy. “Come, Winnie, we’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of to-morrow. You’ll {{want all}} your wits about you after I am taken away.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The old story, Sir Harry. He has weeded his stable, and <b>got</b> {{the buyers}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that they were}} getting the cream. There isn't a man in England knows better what he's about than Altringham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peckham Rye is a {{long way}} off, certainly," [...] added the indignant Mrs. Chalk, after a pause. [...] "It’s a pity you haven’t <b>got</b> {{something}} better <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of, at your time of life, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I'm {{going to}} have my say," [...] Charles {{asserted}} with increasing irritability. [...] "And it's lucky for you with your fool sentiments that you've <b>got</b> somebody <b>to</b> <b>think</b> ahead for you, else you'd all starve to death. I tell you that famine's coming. I've been studying the situation. Flour will be two dollars a pound, or ten, and no sellers. You mark my words." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shore. You see, I can't {{keep up with}} you. Brown an' {{his friends}} will foller us across the river a ways. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of number one in this game." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] she replied; [...] "I can't do that. For one thing, {{it would}} be too late when we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Victoria, I <b>think</b> we could get an {{engagement}} if we reached Vancouver in time to get to Kamloops by--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{a letter}} from Mr. Ford, Mistress Blythe, {{and he says the}} life-book is {{accepted}} and is going to be published next fall. I felt fair uplifted when I <b>got</b> the news. <b>To</b> <b>think</b> that I'm <b>to</b> see it in print at last." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite too late. A {{week ago}} I could have borne it. I had almost <b>got</b> myself <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that it would}} be better that I should bear it.
