40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability of vitamin C to increase the antioxidative and immunomodulating potential in healthy dogs. Fifteen dogs were tested for the effects of orally administered vitamin E (60 mg <b>dl-alpha</b> <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate)</b> in combination with vitamin C (0, 30 or 60 mg ascorbic acid crystalline). Three treatments (0, 30, 60 mg vitamin C) were tested in a 3 x 3 cross-over study in three periods of 36 days. Pre-prandial blood samples were taken for analysis of vitamins C, E, A, retinyl palmitate and stearate, antioxidant status [Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and uric acid], biochemical and haematological analysis. Subpopulations of lymphocytes, mitogen-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation (PBMC) and serum IgA and IgG concentrations were determined. There was a trend (p = 0. 056) for an increased plasma vitamin C concentration by vitamin C supplementation. There was no evidence that dietary treatment altered neither the other plasma vitamin concentrations nor TBARS and uric acid concentrations nor the subpopulations of the lymphocytes except for the number of CD 4 (+) lymphocytes that increased with vitamin C supplementation. There was no effect of vitamin C on serum IgA and IgG concentration. A significant time x treatment interaction was demonstrated on PBMC's to pokeweed, with an increase observed by 30 mg vitamin C supplementation but a decrease by 60 mg vitamin C supplementation. There was no clear evidence for an effect of dietary vitamin C on antioxidative capacity in healthy dogs fed a diet with vitamin E concentrations well above the recommendations.

40|$|The {{effect of}} dietary supplementation with 0, 100 and 450 mg of vitamin E (<b>DL-alpha</b> <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate)</b> /kg of a dry diet on the {{kinetics}} of macrophage recruitment and giant cell {{formation in the}} pacu, maintained at different stocking densities (5 kg/m(3) and 20 kg/m(3)), was investigated by insertion of round glass coverslips into the subcutaneous connective tissue. After a feeding period of 18 weeks, the coverslips were implanted and later removed for examination at 2, 7 and 15 days post-implantation. Fish fed diets supplemented with 450 mg of vitamin E showed an increase (P < 0. 05) in the accumulation of macrophages, foreign body giant cells and Langhans type cells. the kinetics of macrophage recruitment and giant cell formation on the glass coverslips appeared to be strongly influenced by vitamin E supplementation, since fish fed a basal diet and held at high stocking densities showed low numbers of adhering cells on the coverslips, and high concentrations of plasma corticosteroids. On the other hand, fish given a diet supplemented with 450 mg of vitamin E did not show a similar difference in plasma cortisol concentrations related to stocking density. the effect of cortisol concentrations on carbohydrate metabolism, analysed by assessment of plasma glycaemia, was not clear. Blood glucose concentrations did not vary substantially with the different treatments examined. These results suggest that vitamin E {{may contribute to the}} efficiency of the fish's inflammatory response by increasing macrophage recruitment and giant cell formation in the foreign body granulomatous reaction. Vitamin E appeared to act on the stress response of pacus by preventing a stress-related immunosuppression. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Similar studies {{have not been}} done in term infants. Objective: We evaluated the vitamin E and antioxidant status of term infants fed formulas differing in the amount and form of vitamin E acetate. Design: A controlled, blinded, multisite study was completed with 77 term infants randomly assigned to 1 of 3 different infant-for-mula groups. The HIGHNAT-E formula (n = 26) contained 20 IU RRR [...] tocopheryl acetate/L (14. 5 mg/L), the LOWNAT-E for-mula (n = 25) contained 10 IU RRR [...] tocopheryl acetate/L (7. 3 mg/L), and the SYN-E formula (n = 26) contained 13. 5 IU synthetic all-rac [...] tocopheryl acetate/L (13. 5 mg/L). A human milk–fed group (n = 29) served as a reference. Results: Although the LOWNAT-E formula contained only one-half the concentration of -tocopherol that the SYN-E formula did (7. 3 compared with 13. 5 mg/L), the infants fed the LOWNAT-E formula had plasma -tocopherol concentrations that {{were not significantly different}} from those of the infants fed the SYN-E for-mula. However, -tocopherol intakes in the study population, when expressed as mg 2 R-tocopherol isomers consumed/d, corre-lated with plasma -tocopherol (r = 0. 20, P = 0. 02) and the ratio of plasma -tocopherol to lipids (r = 0. 19, P = 0. 03). There were no significant differences in antioxidant status between the 3 groups, but the LOWNAT-E group showed a trend toward lower plasma isoprostanes.

The tocopherol contents of plasma, red cells, and lipoproteins were measured up to 76 h after the dose. In normal subjects all three tocopherols were absorbed and secreted in chylomicrons with equal efficiencies. Both d 2 -gamma- and d 3 -SRR-alpha-tocopherols peaked at similar concentrations in the other lipoprotein fractions, then decreased similarly, but 2 - 4 times more rapidly than did d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopherol. A lipoprotein lipase-deficient patient and a patient with prolonged production of chylomicrons with absent apolipoprotein B- 100 also demonstrated the lack of discrimination between tocopherols during absorption. Despite abnormal apolipoprotein B- 100 production in two patients, the "VLDL" was preferentially enriched in d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopherol.

These are two of eight stereoisomers in synthetic vitamin E. By day 1 the plasma and red blood cells were enriched fourfold with d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopherol (P less than 0. 004). The ratio of d 6 -RRR-/d 2 -SRR- further increased over the succeeding 4 days, because the d 3 -SRR- decreased {{at a faster rate}} than did the d 6 -RRR-stereoisomer. Plasma and lipoproteins were isolated at intervals during the first day, and daily for 3 days, from four additional subjects fed a mixture of equal amounts of the deuterated tocopherols. The plasma contained similar concentrations of the two forms until 11 h, when the d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopherol concentration became significantly greater (P less than 0. 05). The chylomicrons contained similar concentrations of the two deuterated tocopherols, but the VLDL (very low density lipoproteins) became preferentially enriched in d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopherol by 11 h. The pattern of the deuterated tocopherols shows that during chylomicron catabolism all of the plasma lipoproteins were labeled equally with both tocopherols, but that during the subsequent VLDL catabolism the low and high density lipoproteins became enriched in d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopherol.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{increase}} in the number of cosmetic preparations containing antioxidant vitamins, chiefly, due to their action in preventing the process of skin aging, there is a need to develop pre-formulation studies and to validate analytical methods in order to obtain high quality products. Thus, the objective of this research was to evaluate and compare the thermal behavior of <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> and ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate as raw materials, and incorporated into a base cream. Thermogravimetry (TG / DTG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used for this purpose. Both vitamins were found to be stable up to 250 ºC. The base cream (placebo) and the sample (base cream containing the vitamins) presented different weight loss. Thermal analysis has shown itself to be an excellent tool for the characterization of these vitamins and can be used in routine analysis for quality control of this type of cosmetic formulation...|$|R
40|$|In vitro models {{based on}} human {{physiology}} {{have been developed}} as simple, inexpensive and reproducible tools to predict the bioavailability of different food components. Our aim {{was to assess the}} applicability of an in vitro digestion model to estimate the bioaccessibility of fat-soluble vitamins contained in commercially available liquid milk. For vitamin A, the rate and degree of hydrolysis of both endogenous and synthetic ester forms varied according to the type of milk (skimmed versus whole), although the amount of free retinol transferred into micelles was equivalent. For vitamin E, there was apparently no hydrolysis of <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> contained in fortified whole milk, while it was incomplete in the skimmed milk. Overall, in vitro results appear consistent with in vivo observations supporting the potential applicability and predictive value of the in vitro approach to assess the bioavailability of fat-soluble vitamins from dairy matrices.

40|$|Cch 1 p and Mid 1 p are {{components}} of a high-affinity Ca 2 +-permeable channel in the yeast plasma membrane. Here, we show that growth of mutants in the Cch 1 pMid 1 p channel is markedly hypersensitive to low temperature and to high iron concentration in the medium. Both phenotypes were suppressed by high Ca 2 + concentration. Iron stress elicited an increased Ca 2 + influx into both wild type and cch 1 Δmid 1 Δ yeast. Inhibition of calcineurin strongly depressed growth of iron-stressed wild type yeast, indicating that calcineurin is a downstream element of the iron stress response. Iron hypersensitivity of the cch 1 Δmid 1 Δ mutant {{was not associated with}} an increased iron uptake. An involvement of oxidative stress in the iron-hypersensitive phenotype was indicated by the findings that the antioxidants <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> and (ethyl) glutathione improved growth and viability of the iron-stressed mutant. Further, the degree of glutathione oxidation was increased in the presence of iron. The results indicate that iron stress leads to an increased oxidative poise and that Cch 1 pMid 1 p is essential to tolerate this condition...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2002 The {{relative}} enrichment of skin {{sebaceous gland}} lipids with deuterium-labeled α-tocopherol was compared with plasma enrichment {{to evaluate the}} delivery of vitamin E to skin. For {{the first week of}} this study, each subject consumed a daily dose of deuterated vitamin E (150 mg of an equimolar mixture of RRR-α-[5 -(C²H₃) ]-(d₃) and all rac-α-[5, 7 -(C²H₃) ₂]-(d₆) <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetates)</b> with breakfast. Blood was drawn and skin lipids were collected daily for two weeks, then every other day for the following two weeks. Labeled and unlabeled vitamin E analysis was carried out using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Skin cholesterol, plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were measured to evaluate changes in vitamin E levels relative to lipid content. While d₃ and d₆-α-tocopherols were found in plasma 24 h after the first dose, d₃-α-tocopherol was only detected in the skin sebaceous gland secretions after 1 week of supplementation. This data suggests a skin-mediated delivery system for vitamin E into skin lipid secretions. This finding is also supported by the observation that the ratio of α-to γ-tocopherol was greater in the skin than in the plasma...|$|R
40|$|Loading ‘difficult to deliver’ {{therapeutic}} agents into lipid nanoparticles (LN) is {{an attractive}} means to administer them to the skin. However, employing colloidal carriers to administer therapeutic agents from semi-solid preparations adds an extra dimension to the already complex process of topical drug delivery. The aim of this work was {{to understand how the}} mobility of nanoparticles influenced the delivery of a model drug when the carriers were suspended in a hyaluronic acid (HA) vehicle. <b>Tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> (TA) was loaded into lipid nanoparticles (TALN) that were < 100 nm in size and physically stable for more than 28 days. The TALN interacted with the HA polymeric chains to increase formulation macroviscosity. Nanoparticle tracking analysis confirmed that the gel hindered the TALN mobility. However, deliberate manipulation of the particle mobility in the gel by varying the concentration of HA had little effect on TA delivery. Only ca. 10 μg/cm 2 of administered TA was delivered into porcine skin regardless of the vehicle characteristics and this suggested that drug release from the LN was the rate limiting step in the delivery process and not the nanoparticle–vehicle–skin interactions...|$|R
