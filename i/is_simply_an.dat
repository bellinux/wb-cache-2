5|$|The {{effects of}} climate change on teleosts could be {{powerful}} but are complex. For example, increased winter precipitation (rain and snow) could harm populations of freshwater fish in Norway, whereas warmer summers could increase growth of adult fish. In the oceans, teleosts may be able to cope with warming, as it <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>an</b> extension of natural variation in climate. It is uncertain how ocean acidification, caused by rising carbon dioxide levels, might affect teleosts.|$|E

Traumatic SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion. It usually happens in the setting of other forms of traumatic brain injury and has been linked with a poorer prognosis. It is unclear, however, if this {{is a direct result of}} the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>an</b> indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|Relativity of {{simultaneity}} maybe imply eternalism (and hence a B-theory of time), {{where the}} present for different observers {{is a time}} slice of the four dimensional universe. However this suggestion can be countered in the A-Theorist perspective by simply suggesting the perceived lack of simultaneity <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>an</b> illusion caused by varying perspective occurring at different observers.This is demonstrated in the Rietdijk–Putnam argument and additionally in an advanced form of this argument called the Andromeda paradox, created by mathematical physicist Roger Penrose.|$|E
25|$|Certain animals, {{including}} {{bats and}} cetaceans, {{have the ability}} to determine orientation to other objects through interpretation of reflected sound (like sonar). They most often use this to navigate through poor lighting conditions or to identify and track prey. There is currently an uncertainty whether this <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>an</b> extremely developed post-sensory interpretation of auditory perceptions or it actually constitutes a separate sense. Resolution of the issue will require brain scans of animals while they actually perform echolocation, a task that has proven difficult in practice.|$|E

Although RNA cleavage {{is often referred to}} as hydrolysis, the mechanism employed does not in fact involve the addition of water. Rather, the cleavage reaction <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>an</b> isomerization that consists of rearrangement of the linking phosphodiester bond. It is the same reaction, chemically, that occurs with random base-mediated RNA degradation, except that it is highly site-specific and the rate is accelerated 10,000-fold or more.|$|E

25|$|Government, {{bankruptcy}} and general auctions are amongst {{the most common}} auctions to be found today. A government auction <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>an</b> auction held {{on behalf of a}} government body generally at a general sale. Here one may find a vast range of materials that have to be sold by various government bodies, for example: HM Customs & Excise, the Official Receiver, the Ministry of Defence, local councils and authorities, liquidators, as well as material put up for auction by companies and members of the public. Also in this group you will find auctions ordered by executors who are entering the assets of individuals who have perhaps died in testate (those who have died without leaving a will), or in debt. One of the most interesting bodies to look out for at auction is HM Customs & Excise who may be entering at auction various items seized from smugglers, fraudsters and racketeers.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of {{the event}} argue that the horses are well cared for, {{before and after the}} race itself. At the Calgary Stampede, {{officials}} work closely with local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Calgary Humane Society staff to ensure that the horses are fit enough to endure the race. Wagon drivers express sadness over the periodic deaths of horses at the Stampede, explaining that, while unfortunate, animal injury and death are a normal element of any ranch or farming operation. Critics counter that chuckwagon racing <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>an</b> adrenailine sport and produces no food. Thus the practice is an unnecessary and cruel risk to force horses to take. It is unclear how broad public support for the sport actually is, although it has been a marquee event for the Calgary Stampede for many decades, perhaps {{in part because of the}} possibility of disaster and the drama it adds to the Stampede as entertainment.|$|E
