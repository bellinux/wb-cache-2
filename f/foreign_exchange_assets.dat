40|$|Based on {{a dynamic}} open-economy {{macroeconomic}} model, this paper aims at understanding {{the contribution of}} domestic financial under-development to foreign reserve accumulation in some emerging market economies, especially in China.

It is further proved using a Ramsey problem that purchasing <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>assets</b> is a welfare-improving policy for the social planner when the domestic economy faces two sources of frictions: credit constraint and capital controls. Infact, whendomestic firms are occasionally credit-constrained and {{they do not have a}} direct access to international financial market, they need domestic saving instrument to increase their retained earnings in order to invest in capital. The central bank/government plays the role of financial intermediary and provides domestic firms with a liquid publicbond, thus relaxing the domestic credit constraint.

40|$|The recent {{declines in}} China's {{financial}} account balance ended the twin surplus era {{and led to}} a modest decline in the stock of official reserves, which reflects a reversal in expectations for the Chinese currency. Negative balances, which have been visible in China's financial balances since the last quarter of 2011, have heightened fears/anxiety in markets. These deficits stand {{in sharp contrast to the}} typical financial account surplus that existed until 2010. The announcement in September 2011 by Chinese monetary authorities of a two-way floating RMB in the foreign exchange market has unsettled market expectations and has led to a sharp fall in the financial balance. The latter brought a change in the expectations regarding the RMB-USD exchange rate. This change was reflected in the drop in <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>assets,</b> which was caused by a jump in short-term trade credits to prepay (for imports) in dollars, a rise in dollar advances from banks, and a withdrawal of dollar deposits. These changes have, of late, been a cause of concern relating to the future of China's economic relations vis- 0 -vis trading and financial partners, which include the United States. The experience of China, in a changing world beset with deregulation and with speculation affecting her external balance in recent years, provides further confirmation of John Maynard Keynes's observation, in 1937, regarding uncertainty in markets: About these matters there is no scientific basis on which to form any calculable probability whatever.

Stephen Taylor provides a comprehensive introduction to the dynamic behavior of asset prices, relying on finance theory and statistical evidence. He uses stochastic processes to define mathematical models for price dynamics, but with less mathematics than in alternative texts. The key topics covered include random walk tests, trading rules, ARCH models, stochastic volatility models, high-frequency datasets, and the information that option prices imply about volatility and distributions.

40|$|Hong Kong {{is one of}} a few economies {{that operate}} a {{variation}} of a currency board as the basis of their monetary system. This system has persisted despite dramatic changes {{in the way that the}} international monetary system operates and despite changes in Hong Kong's political status. The currency board now faces new challenges with the greater flexibility in the RMB exchange rate and the recent depreciation of the USD that has been dramatically reversed as part of the global financial crisis of 2008. This paper examines how the operations of the Exchange Fund were adapted to react to an earlier period of international monetary disorder when the pegged exchange rate system of the 1950 s and 1960 s collapsed. Based on archival evidence from the HSBC Group Archive, the HSBC Asia Pacific Archive, the Bank of England, UK Treasury and UK Foreign Office, this paper examines how the core rule of issuing currency only against <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>assets</b> was abandoned in 1972. It presents new data on the accounts of the Exchange Fund for this period and describes minutes of the meetings of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The evidence explores the 1972 decision in its longer term policy context and argues that it was the culmination of a series of alterations to the operation of the Exchange Fund during the collapse of the pegged exchange rate system from 1967 onward. The main argument is that the Hong Kong government's response to the crumbling of the international monetary system was to make the Exchange Fund operate as much more than a currency board well before 1972. In particular, it was used to provide forward cover for commercial banks but this proved especially costly in the volatile environment of the end of the global pegged exchange rate system, so that in 1974 the assets of the Exchange Fund fell to 77 % of the note issue. ...|$|E
40|$|An asset is any {{financial}} instrument like shares of companies, bonds, <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>assets</b> {{and a lot}} of others. A Portfolio is collection of these assets held by companies, financial and other institutions and rich individuals. People invest in Portfolios to invest their capital and make profits out of them. In this work, we discuss in depth the problem of Portfolio Optimization through the application of Evolutionary Algorithms, Genetic Algorithms in particular. Portfolio Optimization can be considered a resource allocation problem, where the capital to be invested is the resource and it is invested in various assets held the Portfolio. It is mainly based on the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) proposed by Harry Markowitz in 1952. The main idea is that by diversification, holding various kinds of assets, the total risk associated with the Portfolio can be reduced (the specific risk) while maintaining the target expected return. A lot of researchers have proposed various optimizing techniques to find an optimized Portfolio for different markets. The MPT was an extremely significant work in this field. However, {{it has a lot of}} restrictions and assumptions in it. If we can reduce/remove those restrictions that do not hold in real world, the problem becomes a very complicated one. At the same time, the optimized Portfolio evolved like this is much more realistic and can be practically used. There have been a number of researches proposing various numerical techniques to solve this problem. We are going to concentrate on Genetic Algorithms in this work, which are random search meta-heuristics. Genetic Algorithms have proved time and again, to work well with these kinds of problems. In this work, we have proposed some new points, which we believe will overcome the weak points of previous researches. The point of new mutation operator that optimizes each and every weight present in the Portfolio has been proposed, in addition to the concept of Traded Volumes which is basically an indirect way of incorporating the impact of news on the financial markets. The results achieved are motivating and the approach, we believe, will be used as a reference for future related works to develop Portfolios in real world. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電気系工学専...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{growth in}} the number and size of {{sovereign}} wealth funds (SWFs) in recent years has occasioned a broad-ranging policy debate about how best to accommodate or, indeed, limit the participation of these funds in the world’s capital markets. The announcement in March 2007 that China would open an SWF, with an initial investment of US $ 200 billion, substantially raised the pitch of this debate as pundits and policymakers around the world pondered the impact that China’s massive foreign exchange reserves could have on world markets. Among those worried about the SWF boom many argue, as Larry Summers has, that these funds “shake” the logic of capitalism because government-as-owner may well pursue objectives other than the maximization of share value. In a now-famous piece, Summers (2007) wrote: “The logic of the capitalist system depends on shareholders causing companies to act so as to maximise the value of their shares. It is far from obvious that this will overtime be the only motivation of governments as shareholders. ” The worry is that governments may use equity stakes in foreign companies to attain strategic ends such as the re-direction of scare natural resources to their own countries, acquisition of cutting-edge technology and/or the support of national champions’ extension overseas. And, indeed, the investment record of two of the world’s oldest SWFs show that these funds can become entwined with governments’ pursuit of the national interest. The history of Singapore’s two SWFs, Temasek Holdings and Government Investment Corporation (GIC), making strategic investments in support of national champions including SingTel and Singapore Airlines is familiar to market-watchers. Yet other observers see newcomer SWFs as a largely benign by-product of the growth of the global current account imbalance since the late 90 ’s: SWFs are a practical means for states to reduce the opportunity costs imposed by too-large accumulations of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>assets</b> in the case of non-commodity funds and to diversify investments in the case of commodity funds. Since there are unimpeachable economic incentives to explain the recent profusion of SWF’s, so the argument goes, what good reason is there to think that SWF’s investment practices will have any motive other than wealth creation? As Steven Schwarzman (2008), chair of Blackstone Group enthused: “Our experience with sovereign funds is that they’re smart, they’re long term, they’re highly professional. All they’re looking for is to earn the highest rate of return. ” This paper is addressed to a question that is analytically prior to the Western policy debate about the global implications of China’s sovereign wealth fund, namely: just what “government” is it that runs the China Investment Corporation (CIC) ? Commentators in the West have tended to discuss the CIC as though it were an appendage of a unified government pursuing a clearly-defined national interest, {{as if it were the}} overseas finance arm of “China Inc. ” Our analysis of the CIC shows that this “black-boxing” of the CIC can lead to serious misunderstandings about the fund’s investment strategy and also to an overestimation of the basic strength of China’s SWF. In this paper, we trace the intense bureaucratic conflicts that shaped the creation of CIC and show how the conflicting mandates of the involved parties act as a significant constraint on CIC’s operations down to the present day. In the tradition of IPE scholars attuned to the inside-out causal mechanisms in the global political economy, we suggest that careful analysis of the domestic policy process ought to be a key component of our future efforts to analyze the likely impact of sovereign wealth funds on the global political economy.

First, China's exports to the USA might continue to decline. Second, in the medium term, the higher US inflation rate {{will lead to a}} weak dollar, which will negatively affect China's exports. Third, in the long term, when the US Federal Reserve decreases money supply to control inflation, the US economy might enter another recession, hurting China's exports further. Fourth, China's <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> reserve <b>assets</b> might suffer heavy losses when the US inflation rate rises.
