40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} reported natural infection of <b>Hanuman</b> <b>langurs</b> (Semnopithecus entellus) from Lucknow, India by a novel simian retrovirus, SRV- 6, a β-retrovirus (type D retrovirus). Here we describe infection by a closely related SRV- 6 {{in an isolated}} feral population of <b>Hanuman</b> <b>langurs</b> from Jodhpur in the Northwestern desert region of India. Serological analyses, using in-house ELISA and WB, genomic amplification, and sequencing of env region (gp 70 and gp 20) of the viral genome were carried out. SRV- 6 -infected langurs from the two regions were serologically cross-reactive. The env gene was used for phylogenetic analyses, being the most variable part of a retroviral genome. The surface glycoproteins (gp 70) were almost identical between the two SRV- 6 isolates and related to but distinct from equivalent regions from other exogenous SRVs. We could sequence the transmembrane glycoprotein gp 20 from SRV- 6 infecting the Jodhpur langurs, which was again shown {{to be related to}} but unique compared to the other known SRVs. The study suggests that natural infection by related strains of SRV- 6 occurs in wild langurs from different parts of India...|$|R
25|$|Gray <b>langurs</b> or <b>Hanuman</b> <b>langurs,</b> {{the most}} {{widespread}} langurs of the Indian Subcontinent, are a group of Old World monkeys constituting {{the entirety of the}} genus Semnopithecus (from Ancient Greek σεμνός semnós, “revered, august, holy”, and πίθηκος píthēkos, “ape, monkey”). All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.|$|R

50|$|Hrdy's PhD thesis {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that overcrowding causes infanticide in langur colonies. She went to Mount Abu in India to study <b>Hanuman</b> <b>langurs</b> and concluded that infanticide was independent of overcrowding—it was possibly an evolutionary tactic: When an outside male takes over a group, he usually proceeds to kill all infants. This postulated tactic would be very advantageous to the male langurs who practiced infanticide. Turnover in a langur tribe occurs approximately every 27 months. The male who is taking over has a very small window of opportunity to pass on his genes. If the females are nursing infants, it's likely that they won't ovulate for another year. Killing their dependent infants makes the females once again receptive to mating.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hanuman</b> <b>langurs</b> (or gray langurs) are Old World monkeys {{found in}} India. They are a social animal, living in groups that {{consist of a}} single {{dominant}} male and multiple females. The dominant male has a reproductive monopoly within the group, which causes sub-ordinate males to have a much lower fitness value in comparison. To gain the opportunity to reproduce, sub-ordinate males try {{to take over the}} dominant role within a group, usually resulting in an aggressive struggle with the existing dominant male. If successful in overthrowing the previous male, unrelated infants of the females are then killed. This infanticidal period is limited to the window just after the group is taken over. Cannibalism, however, has not been observed in this species.|$|R

50|$|Today, the rhesus macaques and the <b>Hanuman</b> <b>langur</b> {{commonly}} {{roam the}} streets and temples of India. On Tuesdays and Saturdays, holy days which represent the good deeds of Hanuman, they are brought an abundance of foods. Because of this, {{there has been a}} population boom of monkeys in urban areas. This has forced locals to keep their windows and doors tightly shut, lest monkeys raid their homes. Government officials claim to have lost important files to monkeys. The monkeys have bitten people and threatened visiting foreign dignitaries. Attempts to control the monkey population, including relocation, sterilization, and outlawing feeding them, have been ineffective.|$|E

50|$|Infanticide {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied in vertebrates such as <b>hanuman</b> <b>langurs,</b> big cats, house sparrows and mice. However, this behavior also occurs in the invertebrates. For example, in the spider Stegodyphus lineatus, males invade female nests and toss out their egg sacs. Females only have one clutch in their lifetime, and experience reduced reproductive success if the clutch is lost. This results in vicious battles where injury and even death can occur. Jacana jacana, a tropical wading bird, {{provides an example of}} infanticide by the female sex. Females guard a territory while males care for their young. As males are a limited resource, other females will commonly displace or kill their young. Males can then mate again and care for the young of the new female.|$|R
40|$|Although {{the killing}} of {{dependent}} infants by adult males is a widespread phenomenon among primates, its causes and consequences still remain hotly debated. According to the sexual selection hypothesis, infanticidal males will gain a reproductive advantage provided that only unrelated infants are killed and that the males increase their chances of siring the next infants. Alternatively, the social pathology hypothesis interprets infanticide {{as a result of}} crowded living conditions and, thus, as not providing any advantage. Based on DNA analyses of wild <b>Hanuman</b> <b>langurs</b> (Presbytis entellus) we present the first evidence that male attackers were not related to their infant victims. Furthermore, in all cases the presumed killers were the likely fathers of the subsequent infants. Our data, therefore, strongly support the sexual selection hypothesis interpreting infanticide as an evolved, adaptive male reproductive tactic...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} two main issues: {{personality}} (stable {{individual differences in}} behavior) and behavioral endocrinology (or socioendocrinology) in nonhuman primates. The {{first part of the}} thesis comprises of two primate personality studies of two species: <b>Hanuman</b> <b>langurs</b> and Barbary macaques. Two basic methods of animal personality research (behavioral coding and trait rating) were compared. Stability of personality assessments has been demonstrated. Social rank of individuals was used to validate the questionnaire ratings as well as to illustrate the independence and stability of personality assessment. The second part of the thesis is based on two studies investigating hormone levels in female Barbary macaques. The relationship between cortisol, testosterone, dominance hierarchy and behavior was investigated. And the possible effect of maternal hormone levels around the time of conception on the sex of an infant was evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of bacterial flora in the <b>Hanuman</b> <b>langur</b> (Presbytis entellus) of the Gujarat state Material and Methods: Thirty <b>hanuman</b> <b>langur</b> (Presbytis entellus) (20 male and 10 female), were screened for bacterial flora {{during the period of}} June, 2010 to March, 2011. <b>Hanuman</b> <b>langur</b> (Presbytis entellus) were screened by culture of nasal, oral and rectal swabs during routine health monitoring and samples incubated using appropriate media and specific selective culture methods. Bacterial organisms from the normal as well of affected with various diseases and disorders conditions viz. infected wound, electric shock, road accident, jaw injury, stomatitis, respiratory infection and diarrhea were subcultured and identified for genus and species. Results: Significant normal pathogens of the nasal and oral swabs were found mainly Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Klebsiella spp., and Proteus spp. whereas from the rectal swabs of <b>hanuman</b> <b>langur</b> the significant pathogen noted were Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., E. coli spp., Salmonella spp., Proteus vulgaris spp., Klebsiella spp. and Shigella spp. The serotypes of E. coli isolated from rectal swabs of <b>hanuman</b> <b>langur</b> were identified as rough type, O 138 and O 20. The major antigenic structure of E. coli revealed O 138 (10), O 20 (6) with rough types (2). Out of the total 10 cases of diarrhea O 138 was observed from five isolates while O 20 recorded from 3 cases. Out of remained two isolates one isolate of diarrhea revealed rough type and one revealed non typing antigenic structure. Conclusion: The bacteriological prevalence in healthy and infected hanuman langurs in Gujarat reported for the first time inthe current study may serve as a guideline for future studies in the same species.

5000|$|Pawlowski's {{paper offers}} views {{that differ from}} the other {{hypotheses}} regarding concealed ovulation in that it pinpoints physiological changes in early humans {{as the cause of}} concealed ovulation rather than social or behavioral ones.

However, the fact that the <b>Hanuman</b> <b>langurs</b> also display some concealed ovulation and that it is not directly caused by a physiological change to bipedalism may suggest bipedalism was not, at least, the sole cause of concealed ovulation in humans.

Animals have also engaged in kissing, touching of noses, mouths and muzzles have been witnessed in African elephants, walruses, and mountain zebras. Primates also engage in kissing that is incredibly similar to human display of kissing. Chimpanzees have full mouth-to-mouth contact, and bonobos kiss with their mouth open and mutual tongue stimulation. There are a variety of acts to show affection such as African elephants intertwining their trunks, giraffes engaging in “necking”, and <b>Hanuman</b> <b>langurs</b> cuddling with each other in a front to back sitting position.|$|R
