5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsy</b> and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsy)</b> must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|The few {{contraindications}} {{to surgery}} include inoperable tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or {{a desire to}} preserve fertility. These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done. Uterine perforation may occur during a D or an <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and lymphedema, along with more common side effects of any surgery, including constipation.|$|E

25|$|Frequently {{the first}} sign of endometrial cancer is {{bleeding}} in post-menopausal women.

25|$|CT {{scanning}} {{is preferred}} {{to assess the}} extent of the tumor in the abdominopelvic cavity, though magnetic resonance imaging can also be used. CT scanning can also be useful for finding omental caking or differentiating fluid from solid tumor in the abdomen, especially in low malignant potential tumors. However, it may not detect smaller tumors. Sometimes, a chest x-ray is used to detect metastases in the chest or pleural effusion. Another test for metastatic disease, though it is infrequently used, is a barium enema, which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease. Positron emission tomography, bone scans, and paracentesis are of limited use; in fact, paracentesis can cause metastases to form at the needle insertion site and may not provide useful results. However, paracentesis can be used in cases where there is no pelvic mass and ascites is still present. A physician suspecting ovarian cancer may also perform mammography or an <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsy</b> (in the case of abnormal bleeding) to assess the possibility of breast malignancies and endometrial malignancy, respectively. Vaginal ultrasonography is often the first-line imaging study performed when an adnexal mass is found. Several characteristics of an adnexal mass indicate ovarian malignancy; they usually are solid, irregular, multilocular, and/or large; and they typically have papillary features, central vessels, and/or irregular internal septations. However, SCST has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study.|$|E
500|$|Approximately 40% {{of cases}} {{are related to}} obesity. Endometrial cancer is also {{associated}} with excessive estrogen exposure, {{high blood pressure and}} diabetes. Whereas taking estrogen alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer, taking both estrogen and a progestogen in combination, as in most birth control pills, decreases the risk. Between two and five percent of cases are related to genes inherited from the parents. Endometrial cancer is sometimes loosely referred to as [...] "uterine cancer", although it is distinct from other forms of uterine cancer such as cervical cancer, uterine sarcoma, and trophoblastic disease. The most frequent type of endometrial cancer is endometrioid carcinoma, which accounts for more than 80% of cases. Endometrial cancer is commonly diagnosed by <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsy</b> or by taking samples during a procedure known as dilation and curettage. A pap smear is not typically sufficient to show endometrial cancer. Regular screening in those at normal risk is not called for.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This is a {{retrospective}} crossectional study designated {{to describe the}} histopathological patterns of <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsies</b> in postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) and to estimate the risk of endometrial cancer in <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsies</b> taken from women presenting with PMB. Materials and Methods: The study included 146 <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsies</b> taken from women presenting with PMB at National Health Laboratory {{during the period from}} January 2009 -June 2010. Data on procedure of endometrial sampling and pathological findings were obtained from files of the National Health Laboratory on predesigned questionnaire, slides, blocks and histopathology reports were revised by the investigator and supervisor. Results obtained were analysed using SSPS soft ware. Results: The procedure of endometrial sampling was dilatation and curettage in 95 (65. 06 %) of biopsies, hysterectomy in 46 (31. 50 %) and polypectomy in 5 (3. 44 %) of patients. Benign lesions constituted 71. 9 % with endometrial polyps being the most frequent pattern (19. 9 %). Malignant lesions were diagnosed in 15. 8 % of biopsies, while 12. 3 % of <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsies</b> were inadequate for interpretation. Endometrial hyperplasia without atypia was found in 17. 8 % of endometrial biopsies; of which 84. 62 % were simple hyperplasia and 15. 38 % were complex hyperplasia. Endometrial cancer was diagnosed in 15. 8 % of <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsies</b> with endometrioid adenocarcinoma being the most common histolopathological type (73. 9 %), 41. 2 % were poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

Decidua associated with tubal pregnancy, pseudodecidua in progestogen-treated patients, and proliferative, secretory, and basal endometria were all negative. An immunoperoxidase stain for human placental lactogen is a useful marker for intrauterine pregnancy and supports the placental origin of the syncytial giant cells in so-called 'syncytial endometritis'.

40|$|Correlation between serum {{progesterone}} concentration, urinary pregnanediol excretion, <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsies,</b> vaginal cytology, and {{basal body}} temperature {{was performed to}} determine the most dependable method for assessing {{the presence of a}} functioning corpus luteum. Vaginal cytology was not completely reliable as it had relatively poor correlations. A biphasic basal body temperature was always associated with a rise of progesterone to luteinization range, but a monophasic chart did not necessarily indicate anovulation. This fallacy, together with difficulties in recording and interpretation, made basal body temperature not totally accurate for assessing luteal activity. Premenstrual <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsies</b> gave the best correlation with hormonal assays. It is thus concluded that serum progesterone determination and properly interpreted endometrial histology are the most accurate diagnostic luteinization parameters. © 1974.

40|$|Objective: Detection {{of nerve}} fibers in <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsies</b> was {{recently}} proposed as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for endometriosis. However, their occurrence in the functional layer of endometrium still remains controversial. Nerve fibers {{were found to}} be present in endometriotic lesions themselves, which may account for some of the pain experienced by patients, but their origin is not clear. The objective {{of the present study was}} to reevaluate the presence of nerve fibers in endometrium and in different types of endometriotic lesions. Patients and methods: Nerve fiber density (PGP 9. 5 immunohistochemical analysis), unmyelinated nerve fiber presence (neurofilament immunohistochemical detection) and nerve growth factor expression were evaluated in endometrial (disease free: n= 20; endometriotic: n= 26) and endometriotic (peritoneal lesion: n= 11; ovarian lesion: n= 16; rectovaginal lesion: n= 27) samples. Results: <b>Endometrial</b> <b>biopsies</b> {{were found to be}} mostly negative for nerve fibers. Nerve fiber density was higher in deep nodular lesions than in peritoneal (p<. 01) or ovarian (p<. 001) lesions. Around 30 % of PGP 9. 5 -positive nerve fibers were confirmed by neurofilament staining. Nerve growth factor expression was detected at higher levels in the stroma of deep-infiltrating lesions (p<. 05).

40|$|A diverse {{array of}} cytokines is implicated in {{regulating}} the immune adaptation and endometrial tissue remodelling events that facilitate successful embryo implantation and early placental development. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate expression of mRNAs encoding a panel of immunoregulatory cytokines in the endometrium of fertile women and women experiencing recurrent miscarriage using highly sensitive, quantitative RT-PCR assays. <b>Endometrial</b> <b>biopsies</b> were collected during the mid-secretory phase of the menstrual cycle from women classified as proven fertile (control; n = 12) and women experiencing unexplained recurrent miscarriage (RM; n = 9). Reduced IL- 6 mRNA and reduced IL- 1 α mRNA were independently associated with recurrent miscarriage. Altered expression was evident after accounting for variation in the composition of <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsies</b> by normalization of data to epithelial and mesenchymal cell-specific transcripts, cytokeratin- 18 mRNA and vimentin mRNA, respectively. The relative abundance of mRNAs encoding LIF, GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL- 1 β, IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 10, IL- 12 p 40, TNFα, TGFβ 1, TGFβ 2 and TGFβ 3 were not altered in recurrent miscarriage tissue. Associations between expression of IL- 10, LIF, GM-CSF and TGFβ 2 suggest that regulatory circuits link the transcription of these cytokine genes. Inadequate expression of IL- 6 and IL- 1 α mRNAs in endometrial tissue may predispose to recurrent miscarriage through a perturbed maternal immune response, effects on decidual tissue remodeling and angiogenesis, or dysregulated trophoblast differentiation and invasion. Quantitative RT-PCR assays for these cytokines in <b>endometrial</b> <b>biopsies</b> may be a realistic strategy for development of novel diagnostics for predisposition to recurrent miscarriage.
