50|$|System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) is a {{framework}} to compile statistics linking <b>environmental</b> <b>statistics</b> to economic statistics. SEEA {{is described as}} a satellite system to the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA). This means that the definitions, guidelines and practical approaches of the SNA are applied to the SEEA. This system enables <b>environmental</b> <b>statistics</b> to be compared to economic statistics as the system boundaries are the same after some processing of the input statistics. By analysing statistics on the economy and the environment {{at the same time it}} is possible to show different patterns of sustainability for production and consumption. It can also show the economic consequences of maintaining a certain environmental standard.|$|E

40|$|Eco-efficiency links {{economic}} efficiency with environmental efficiency. The {{main purpose of}} the concept is to identify and implement activities to enable production that is both economically more efficient and cleaner. This means that parameters with a high indicative value have to be used. Since both the environmental and the economic performance of industries must be described concurrently, environmental intensity {{appears to be a}} good indicator of eco-efficiency. Environmental intensity is environmental impact per unit of economic performance. In this paper, the environmental impact of industry classes is derived from emission data, released by the European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER), and then aggregated and assessed using Eco-Indicator 99, a single-score life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method. The calculated ratio is thus an accurate description of the environmental-economic state of industry classes. The main advantage of this approach is the underlying consistent statistical framework, that permits, on a disaggregated level, economic data to be correlated with ecological data and to be frequently updated. This single indicator facilitates a comparison of environmental intensity of different industry classes. The paper shows {{that it is possible to}} deduce a disaggregated eco-efficiency indicator, which is exemplified using German data, however could be analysed for different European countries.
