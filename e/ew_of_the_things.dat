40|$|Two {{kinds of}} Bell-states {{diagonal}} (BSD) entanglement witnesses (EW) are constructed by using <b>the</b> algebra <b>of</b> Dirac Î³ matrices in <b>the</b> space-time <b>of</b> arbitrary dimension d, {{where the first}} kind can detect some BSD relativistic and non-relativistic m-partite multispinor bound entangled states in Hilbert space of dimension 2 ^m d/ 2, including the bipartite Bell-type and iso-concurrence type states in the four-dimensional space-time (d= 4). By using the connection between Hilbert-Schmidt measure and the optimal EWs associated with states, it is shown {{that as far as}} the spin quantum correlations is concerned, <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> entanglement is not a relativistic scalar and has no invariant meaning. The introduced EWs are manipulated via the linear programming (LP) which can be solved exactly by using simplex method. The decomposability or non-decomposability <b>of</b> these <b>EWs</b> is investigated, where <b>the</b> region <b>of</b> non-decomposable <b>EWs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first kind is partially determined and it is shown that, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EWs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second kind are decomposable.

Also, multispinor EWs with non-polygon feasible regions are provided, where the problem is solved by approximate LP, and in contrary to the exactly manipulatable EWs, both the first and second kind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optimal approximate <b>EWs</b> can detect some bound entangled states.

40|$|We present new {{results from}} Monte Carlo {{calculations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flux and equivalent width (<b>EW)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ni Kalpha fluorescent emission {{line in the}} toroidal X-ray reprocessor model of Murphy & Yaqoob (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1549). In the Compton-thin regime, <b>the</b> <b>EW</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ni Kalpha line is a factor of ~ 22 less than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fe Kalpha line but this factor can be as low as ~ 6 in the Compton-thick regime. We show that the optically-thin limit for this ratio depends only on the Fe to Ni abundance ratio, it being independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geometry and covering factor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reprocessor, and also independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident X-ray continuum. We give some useful analytic expressions for the absolute flux and <b>the</b> <b>EW</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ni Kalpha line in the optically-thin limit. When the reprocessor is Compton-thick and the incident continuum is a power-law with a photon index <b>of</b> 1. 9, <b>the</b> Ni Kalpha line EW has a maximum value of ~ 3 eV and ~ 250 eV for non-intercepting and intercepting lines-of-sight respectively. Larger EWs are obtained for flatter continua. We have also studied <b>the</b> Compton shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ni Ka line and find that <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> scattered to unscattered flux in the line has a maximum value of 0. 26, less than the corresponding maximum for the Fe Kalpha line. However, we find that <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Compton shoulder profile for a given column density and inclination angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> torus {{is similar to the}} corresponding profile for the Fe Ka line. Our results will be useful for interpreting X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and X-ray binary systems in which the system parameters are favorable for the Ni Kalpha line to be detected.

40|$|Aims: We {{developed}} a new method <b>of</b> estimating <b>the</b> stellar parameters Teff, log g, [M/H], and elemental abundances. This method was implemented in a new code, SP_Ace (Stellar Parameters And Chemical abundances Estimator). This is a highly automated code suitable for analyzing <b>the</b> spectra <b>of</b> large spectroscopic surveys with low or medium spectral resolution (R= 2, 000 - 20, 000). Methods: After <b>the</b> astrophysical calibration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oscillator strengths <b>of</b> 4643 absorption lines covering the wavelength ranges 5212 - 6860 Ã and 8400 - 8924 Ã, we constructed a library that contains <b>the</b> equivalent widths (<b>EW)</b> <b>of</b> these lines for a grid <b>of</b> stellar parameters. <b>The</b> <b>EWs</b> <b>of</b> each line are fit by a polynomial function that describes <b>the</b> <b>EW</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line as a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stellar parameters. <b>The</b> coefficients <b>of</b> these polynomial functions are stored in a library called the "GCOG library". SP_Ace, a code written in FORTRAN 95, uses the GCOG library to compute <b>the</b> <b>EWs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lines, constructs models of spectra as a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stellar parameters and abundances, and searches for the model that minimizes the Ï^ 2 deviation {{when compared to the}} observed spectrum. The code has been tested on synthetic and real spectra {{for a wide range of}} signal-to-noise and spectral resolutions. Results: SP_Ace derives stellar parameters such as Teff, log g, [M/H], and chemical abundances of up to ten elements for low to medium resolution spectra of FGK-type stars with precision comparable to the one usually obtained with spectra of higher resolution. Systematic errors in stellar parameters and chemical abundances are presented and identified with tests on synthetic and real spectra. Stochastic errors are automatically estimated by the code for all the parameters. A simple Web front end of SP_Ace can be found at [URL] while the source code will be published soon.
