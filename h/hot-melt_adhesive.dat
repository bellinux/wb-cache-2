5000|$|Traditional {{edge banding}} was a manual process {{requiring}} ordinary carpentry tools and materials.

50|$|Key to {{this process}} are the raw {{materials}} and specialized molding equipment. Dimer acid based polyamide materials, better known as hot-melts, are used as molding compounds. They are thermoplastics i.e. the material, when heated, becomes less viscous {{and is able to}} re-shaped, then hardens to keep the desired form upon cooling down. These polyamide materials differ from other thermoplastics in two main areas:One: Viscosity: At processing temperature (410F/210C) the viscosity is very low, typically around 3,000 centipoise (similar to pancake syrup). Low viscosity materials require low injection pressure in order to inject into a cavity. In fact it is normal to use a simple gear pump to inject the polyamide material. Low injection pressure is paramount, when over-molding relatively fragile electronic component.Two: Adhesion: Polyamide materials are basically high performance <b>hot-melt</b> <b>adhesives.</b> The adhesive properties of polyamide is what seals a chosen substrate. The type of adhesion is purely mechanical i.e. no chemical reaction takes place.|$|R

The <b>hot-melt</b> <b>adhesive</b> wax can realize bridge bonding between various materials, for example, paper, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) film, glass sheets, or metal plate.

To study the biocompatibility and applicability of the wax-based microfluidic chip, we tested the PCR compatibility with the chip materials first.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryXuzhi Susan SunLarge {{amount of}} {{fiberboard}} {{are used for}} packaging applications every year, which generate {{a large amount of}} solid wastes causing environmental pollution if these packaging materials are not recycled. Also, a large amount of wood are needed for making fiberboard, which is limited resource in the earth. Reducing the weight of fiberboard and recycling the fiberboard materials are two methods to save quantities of wood fiber in fiberboard manufacture, which benefit the environment and economy. Besides, most adhesives used for producing the fiberboard contain environmental hazardous chemicals. It is necessary to develop new technology to produce cellulosic fiberboards with environmental friendly bio-based adhesives. The soybean is an agricultural product, and its resource is abundant. Soybean protein is a bio- material that offers an alternative to the existing synthetic adhesives to reduce petroleum dependence of the U. S. energy strategy. The newly developed soy-based adhesive is also competitive in cost. Material cost based on food-grade soybean protein is around 20 cents/Lb. The cost of commercial PF resin is about 14 ~ 17 cents/Lb. Price of <b>hot-melt</b> <b>adhesive</b> for fiberboard is around $ 6 /Lb.

40|$|Metal objects have {{traditionally}} not been repaired or constructed by adhesives, but primarily by soldering, welding, and mechanical assemblies. Soldering has many disadvantages for the conservator such {{as lack of}} reversibility, problems to solder a corroded surface, corrosive flux, heating causing damage to the patina, crystal structure and more. Bonding of historical metal objects with adhesives is here examined. A literature survey is done. Another goal with the work is to get {{an indication of the}} suitability of various adhesives by means of simple test methods. Two test objects (candle holders) of tin, were chosen as basis for the investigation. Six adhesives were selected for testing: Paraloid B- 72, (a thermoplastic acrylic copolymer), two different epoxies, (Araldite 2011 A + B and Bostik Epoxy Rapid) an ethyl cyanoacrylate product, (Loctite Super Glue Precision), Bostik contact, a contact adhesive based on polychloroprene rubber, Dana limstänger, (a hot melt adhesive consisting of an EVA copolymer). These adhesives were subjected to simple tests, a pH test, a so-called Oddy test and a simple tensile test with specimens of tin to investigate strength. In addition, a test for removability of the adhesive and a very simple contact test were carried out. pH tests showed that many of the adhesives are quite acidic when wet. After curing the pH of the epoxies are about pH 9 - 10. The others were more neutral after curing. Oddy test showed that all but Paraloid B- 72 affected lead slightly. ”Epoxy Rapid” affected silver and copper with a dark colour. The results of strength tests were somewhat difficult to interpret. The strength differed greatly between the adhesives. For example the specimens bonded by the <b>hot-melt</b> <b>adhesive</b> fell apart by themselves. The cyanoacrylate was so strong that in one sample the joint was not broken at all, instead the tin specimen broke. When the tests were done the two candlesticks were treated. Only some indicating conjectures can be made by these results.

30|$|Ethylene–vinyl acetate {{copolymers}} (EVA) are widespread materials, with <b>hot-melt</b> <b>adhesives</b> {{and plastic}} wraps being common applications [54]. Although free-radical copolymerizations usually produce gradient or block polymers, perfectly random copolymers are {{obtained from the}} polymerization of ethylene and vinyl acetate due to similar reactivities [55]. However, undesired and random branching is inherently promoted via a back-biting process, significantly altering the characteristics and performance of the copolymers. However, perfectly linear ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymers can be prepared by means of ADMET polymerization [56]. A number of monomers with various methylene run lengths ranging from 8 to 12 were subjected to polymerization and subsequent hydrogenation, furnishing copolymers with different vinyl acetate contents (acetate branches separated by 18 – 26 carbons). Commercial samples with similar vinyl acetate ratios were compared with the ADMET copolymers. Similar to the commercial copolymers, the precision polymers displayed a linear relationship between the melting temperature and vinyl acetate content, but with dissimilar slopes. A larger slope, underlining the precision factor, evidenced the greater order in precision polymers. With a similar approach, copolymers of ethylene and vinyl alcohol were made without difficulty.|$|R
