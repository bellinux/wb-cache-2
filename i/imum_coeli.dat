25|$|The {{opposite}} {{point to}} the midheaven {{is known as the}} <b>imum</b> <b>coeli.</b> For astrologers the nadir or IC traditionally indicates the circumstances {{at the beginning and end}} of a person's life, their parents and the parental home, and their own domestic life. In quadrant house systems it lies on the cusp of the 4th house of the horoscope.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used house system in modern Western astrology. The paths drawn for each degree of the ecliptic to move from the <b>Imum</b> <b>coeli</b> to the horizon, and from the horizon to the midheaven, are trisected to determine the cusps of houses 2, 3, 11, and 12. The cusps of houses 8, 9, 5 and 6 are opposite these. The Placidus system is sometimes not defined beyond polar circles (latitudes greater than 66°N or 66°S), because certain degrees are circumpolar (never touch the horizon), and planets falling in them cannot be assigned to houses without extending the system. This is the result of his weaknesses of the Placidean system according to its critics, which often cite the exceptional house proportions in the higher latitudes.|$|E
50|$|The angles are {{the four}} Cardinal points of an astrological chart: the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Descendant and the <b>Imum</b> <b>Coeli.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Midheaven {{quite often}} {{refers to a}} parent, quite often the mother, but {{sometimes}} the father. The other parent is sometimes represented by the angle at the opposite end, the <b>Imum</b> <b>Coeli,</b> or IC.|$|E
50|$|In whole-sign house systems {{the signs}} and houses have the same boundaries; hence the <b>Imum</b> <b>Coeli</b> can {{actually}} appear in the third house, the fourth house or fifth house; in cases of extreme terrestrial latitude, it may even fall in the second or sixth houses.|$|E
5000|$|In astrology, the <b>Imum</b> <b>Coeli</b> (Latin for [...] "bottom of the sky"), IC, is {{the point}} in space where the {{ecliptic}} crosses the meridian in the north, exactly opposite the Midheaven. It marks the fourth house cusp in most house systems (this is reversed in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5000|$|The point {{opposite}} the Midheaven, {{which is in}} the unseen sky, and would be the midnight point in a chart cast for dawn, is the anticulmination of the Sun, or the <b>Imum</b> <b>Coeli,</b> which is Latin for the [...] "bottom of the sky." [...] This is the last of the four angles.|$|E
50|$|The {{opposite}} {{point to}} the midheaven {{is known as the}} <b>imum</b> <b>coeli.</b> For astrologers the nadir or IC traditionally indicates the circumstances {{at the beginning and end}} of a persons life, their parents and the parental home, and their own domestic life. In quadrant house systems it lies on the cusp of the 4th house of the horoscope.|$|E
50|$|In the Alcabitius, Placidus, Koch, Campanus, Regiomontanus, Meridian and Krusinski house system, {{the local}} {{meridian}} passing through Midheaven forms {{the cusp of}} the 10th house. In the equal house system Midheaven {{can be found in}} the 8th, 9th, 10th or 11th house. The other end of this axis, 'beneath' the earth, is the point known as the IC or <b>Imum</b> <b>Coeli</b> ('lower midheaven', literally 'bottom of the sky').|$|E
50|$|In {{many cases}} the IC refers to a parent - traditionally, the father. Modern astrologers may use the IC as a significator for the mother, or for both parents. There is no {{consensus}} in modern usage for which parent is best represented by the IC. The point is moot for Hellenistic astrologers who considered the fourth house {{the house of the}} father, but did not use the <b>Imum</b> <b>Coeli</b> as the cusp of the fourth house.|$|E
50|$|The fourth house, {{of which}} the cusp is often (but not always) the <b>Imum</b> <b>Coeli,</b> signifies a person's home, security, family, and those things in early life {{that served as a}} {{foundation}} for them. Sometimes the fourth house also is connected with endings, such as a person's end of life. This house is affiliated often with our parents. For the ancients, it was the House of the Father, but in modern charts, it tends to have a more general parental significance.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} the LAP, first {{advanced}} in 1998, proposes that the horoscopeplanet that receives the fewest astrological aspects is thekeynote or {{focal point of the}} birth chart. In the analysis ofplanetary lines in astrocartography, the rising, setting, <b>Imum</b> <b>coeli,</b> and midheaven lines of the LAP represent geographic areasof greatest potential for the native. The theory was initiallydeveloped by analyzing accurately recorded horoscopes of historicalpersonalities, and it has also been successfully applied, in mundane astrology, to the study of historical events.|$|E
5000|$|Some astrologers that {{consult the}} stars refer to their affects as paranatellonta, or [...] "paran" [...] for short. Paranatellonta are stars that fall upon {{one of the}} four angles of the {{horoscope}} (rising or setting, at the midheaven, or at the <b>imum</b> <b>coeli)</b> {{at the same time a}} significant planet is at one of those points. Thus, for example, if Sirius was rising while Jupiter was at the midheaven, Sirius would be considered a paran of Jupiter and could influence the way the astrologer interpreted Jupiter in that horoscope.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Imum</b> <b>Coeli</b> is said {{to refer}} to our roots and also to the least {{conscious}} part of ourselves. It symbolizes foundations, beginnings in life, {{what may have been}} experienced through parental inheritance and homeland influences, need for security and relationships with the home and family life. It also may describe the circumstances that we will encounter {{at the end of our}} lives. Because this house was the most distant point possible from the visible part of the horoscope, Hellenistic astrologers considered the IC to be the home of the underworld, or Hades.|$|E
5000|$|The {{principle}} of House Division introduced in Sripathi Bhāva System {{is described as}} follows: [...] "In the Sripathi system the 1st house cusp is the Lagna, and the 7th house cusp is the Descendant opposite it, the 10th house cusp is at the MC (Medium Coeli or Madhya Lagna), i.e. Zenith, and the 4th house cusp is at the IC (<b>Imum</b> <b>Coeli</b> or Patala Lagna) i.e. Nadir. The four quarters divided thus should be divided into three equal parts each, and thus we find the 12 house cusps in Sripathi system. To find the Bhava Sandhis (meeting points of houses) we should divide {{the distance between the}} house cusps into halves." ...|$|E
5000|$|In astrology, an angular house, or {{cardinal}} house, {{is one of}} four cardinal {{houses of}} the horoscope, which are the houses in which the angles of the chart (the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the <b>Imum</b> <b>Coeli</b> and the Descendant) are found. The angular houses of the horoscope are considered to be the most ardent, or forceful, and are considered to have the greatest impact in the chart. The influential 17th-century astrologer William Lilly states simply: [...] "Planets in angles do more forcibly show their effects." [...] Angular houses rule those critical things in our life, such as our appearance and how we behave, our family life, our married life or partnerships, and our career.|$|E
50|$|The {{ascendant}} is the easternmost or sunrise {{point where}} the ecliptic and horizon intersect; the ascendant and the midheaven are considered the most important angles in the horoscope by {{the vast majority of}} astrologers. In most systems of house division, the ascendant is the cusp of the 1st house and the midheaven is the cusp of the 10th house. The placement of the planetary ruler of the ascendant, called the chart ruler is also considered to be significant. The point in the west diametrically opposing the ascendant is called the descendant, normally the cusp of the 7th house; and the point opposing the M.C. is the cusp of the 4th house, the northernmost point of the chart, called the <b>imum</b> <b>coeli</b> or I.C.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used house system in modern Western astrology. The paths drawn for each degree of the ecliptic to move from the <b>Imum</b> <b>coeli</b> to the horizon, and from the horizon to the midheaven, are trisected to determine the cusps of houses 2, 3, 11, and 12. The cusps of houses 8, 9, 5 and 6 are opposite these. The Placidus system is sometimes not defined beyond polar circles (latitudes greater than 66°N or 66°S), because certain degrees are circumpolar (never touch the horizon), and planets falling in them cannot be assigned to houses without extending the system. This is the result of his weaknesses of the Placidean system according to its critics, which often cite the exceptional house proportions in the higher latitudes.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a couple}} of factors that {{influence}} how strong or weak a force in the chart the ascendant may be. Firstly, it is generally believed that the closer towards the beginning of the sign the ascendant falls, the stronger it will be. This is because most of the first house will fall into that sign. If the ascendant falls late in a sign, most of the first house will fall into the following sign, and thus weaken the effect of the ascendant's power. In addition the ascendant is thought to be stronger in influence when the sun is in a weak position in the chart. For example, it is traditionally believed that the sun is in a weaker position when it is placed {{at the bottom of the}} chart, near the <b>imum</b> <b>coeli</b> or IC. This is because the sun was literally on the other side of the earth when the subject was born, hidden from view. The sun may also be weaker in influence if it is unaspected, in other words if it forms no strong aspects or connections to the other planets.|$|E
