40|$|The {{changing}} paradigm {{from labor}} based business to knowledge based business {{has made an}} inclusion of human resources into an income statement. Among intangible assets, human resources, which is called intellectual capital (IC), becomes the core asset in a company. IC consists three basic elements, they are human capital, structural capital and customer capital. In fact, these are the real power of the company in producing, developing, and bringing the company to the future. Accordingly proponents agree to disclose these on the income statement. Unfortunately, accounting practice has not accounted for them. Whilst, IC describes the creation values, accounting practice does not have tools to identity, measures and disclose them on <b>the</b> annual <b>reports.</b> Therefore this research attempts to provide ideas and open nuance for accountants. This research employ a thick library research, an alternative research methodology that suitable to answer the research question. This research is conducted in depth discourse producing some methods for measuring and reporting IC that are practiced recently. The study concludes that methods of measurement IC have been classified into a financial and non-financial measurement. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>purposes,</b> it is needed a supplement to the income statement consisting an intellectual capital statement...|$|R

40|$|In today’s {{market it}} is {{possible}} to get a competitive advantage with right quality- and safety work to satisfy the customers in the automotive- and manufacturing industry. Today companies are also highly exposed with today’s media and social media which make the quality assurance even more important to avoid bad publicity. This report consists of an investigation about how the automotive- and manufacturing industry work with their suppliers’ to mutually achieve the required quality targets. Toyota Motor Corporation has single handily been a trademark for high quality {{for a long time in}} the automotive industry. Their successful organization is based on different principles which have created The Toyota Way. Thus the authors’ of this report has chosen to select some of these principles, which are thought to be appropriate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reports</b> <b>purpose.</b> <b>The</b> principles are investigated and described so that they can be compared to the case study at Volvo Cars Torslanda. The purpose is to find potential improvement possibilities and recommendations for both Volvo Cars and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> manufacturing industry. The findings and analysis has shown that a more cross-functional way of working in teams between different departments should be used in a greater extension. Thus to achieve greater knowledge in the decision making process concerning the organization and to improve the quality assurance work concerning the suppliers’. Another recommendation is to greater encourage job rotations among the quality engineers concerning the different quality reviews. The authors’ are sure that greater job rotation can encourage better motivation at work and support to become an even more learning organization in addition to achieve the greater quality assurance. With these findings and recommendations the authors’ believe and suggests that further research can be done with a deeper approach towards the specific recommendations to find further improvement possibilities concerning the automotive- and manufacturing industry...|$|R

During the research, interviews with two employees from IBIS were conducted in order to collect empirical material <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>report.</b> <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> {{of the study is}} to problematize development and the tendency in campaigns to stereotype in their representation of the Third World Other. In this case the Yasunícampaign depict indigenousness in very simplified characteristics, which according to Stuart Hall and his theory of representation becomes problematic. Halls concepts of encoding and decoding are used in an analysis of the campaign, in which the red Huaorani mask appears as a key figure. This campaign strategy will become an object <b>for</b> investigation. <b>The</b> study is situated within a postcolonial critique, in particular within the critique formulated by the post development thinker Arturo Escobar, who criticizes development for legitimizing development practise by a lack in a so called ‘underdeveloped’ Third World. The project discusses how understandings of development are inflicted by a ‘Western’ worldview, and how the implementation of so called ‘Western values’ such as ‘human rights’ can be problematic. This study will look further into IBIS positioning in the dominant development discourse – with the work of the Yasunícampaign and as an NGO in general. Furthermore, the issue of ontologies dominating the discourse of development is being addressed and an alternative to the universal human rights based approach, is explained...|$|R

40|$|Claremont McKenna CollegeEarnings {{management}} {{is a key}} issue <b>for</b> financial <b>reporting.</b> <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> {{of this paper is}} to derive a set of indices to measure the pervasiveness of earnings management (PEM) using the properties of quarterly accrual volatility. The PEM index can be viewed as a quality measure of financial reporting and an effectiveness measure for financial monitoring. 1 In contrast to mean-shifting studies in the literature, our measure based on accrual volatility yields two major advantages. First, it relieves us of the necessity of precise assumptions regarding economic events. Second, it provides a macro-perspective on the overall patterns in earnings management. The methodology based on accrual volatility can address issues like the earnings quality, the nature of the informational environment, and the effect of accounting standard setting. Previous method of detecting earnings management focuses on “mean-shifting ” effect: managers are hypothesized to respond to economic events by adjusting accruals in a particular direction for a particular economic motive. This method cannot examine broader trends in the prevalence of earnings management, and macro-issues of information environment. In this paper, we use the properties of seasonal accrual volatility to derive an indirect measure of the pervasiveness of earnings management. 2 Our key assumption states that the bulk of earnings management occurs mainly in the last days of each fiscal yea...|$|R
40|$|In society, {{intellectual}} capital (IC) {{is considered to}} be necessary in order to create value in organizations. The interest has expanded from private to public organizations such as universities. However, there is still a relatively small amount of research about IC reporting in universities, despite the importance of IC in universities. Previous research does not either consider different university characteristics, something that can help {{in the development of a}} common framework <b>for</b> IC <b>reporting.</b> <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> with this study is to explore and explain howdifferent universities report on IC information in their annual reports in regard to the characteristics size, maturity, type of institution and governmental dependence. The purpose was reached through a multiple case study of eight Swedish universities and a content analysis. The theoretical model was developed through resource based view, knowledge based view, institutional diversity and signaling theory and suggest that internal and external pressures affects the usage of IC assets, strategies and intentions with IC <b>reporting.</b> <b>The</b> results show that all universities report on IC information, to different extent. Relational capital and human capital was the types of IC <b>reported</b> on <b>the</b> most which can be explained by its close connection to the individual, compared to structural capital.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Resection of the {{proximal}} {{end of the}} femur and mterpositional arthroplasty was done in thirty-four patients (fifty-six hips) to allow the patients to sit comfortably and to make perineal care painless. All of the patients were severely handicapped because of cerebral palsy, were unable to walk, and were resi-dents of one of two state institutions. After a minimum follow-up of two years, the result had not deteriorated in thirty-three of the thirty-four patients. Spastic deformity of the hip can prevent bedridden adults from sitting and may interfere with perineal hygiene. The majority of such patients are institutionalized because of cerebral palsy, and frequently they are mentally retarded. Severe contractures can lead to breakdown of the skin in the perineal region, decubitus ulcers over the trochanter, and pain in a dislocated or subluxated hip. To solve these physical problems, we sought {{a balance between the}} effectiveness of a surgical procedure and <b>the</b> potential <b>for</b> improvement in <b>the</b> quality of life. After fa-vorable results had been obtained at Children’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, we began to treat a group of such patients with resection of {{the proximal}} end of the femur. Later, patients were similarly treated at Arkansas Children’s Hospital in Little Rock, Arkansas. The patients lived in state institutions affiliated with these two teaching hospitals, and they constitute <b>the</b> material <b>for</b> this <b>report.</b> <b>The</b> primary <b>purpose</b> in enabling these patients to sit comfortably was to minimize the complications of aspiration pneumonia, pressure sores, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and urinary stasis, all of which commonly occur when a patient must be cared for in a supine position...|$|R
