5|$|General Admirals {{armament}} {{was made}} and installed in Russia. Her battery deck carried thirty-six 60-pounder muzzle-loading guns and four long 36-pounder chase guns. The upper deck had twenty-four 60-pounder guns and two long 36-pounder chase guns. Two 3-pood shell guns were mounted fore and aft on revolving platforms. In 1862 her armament was revised and two 60-pounder and the two long 36-pounder guns on her upper deck were removed. Four years later, it was rearranged with two 60-pounders moved from her upper <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> the lower deck and two long 36-pounders moved from the lower <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|On 8 October 1892, a storm-damaged vessel, Sirene, hit the {{southern}} {{side of the}} pier, causing four shops {{and part of the}} <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> collapse onto the beach below. Several columns were also dislodged, and the ship's bowsprit hit the pier entrance. All eleven crew members were rescued when they were hauled onto the pier. Damage to the pier was estimated to be £5,000 and was promptly repaired.|$|E
5|$|Six {{tanks were}} used for each span and left in place for three hours; the 18 tanks used in total allowed three spans to be tested simultaneously. At {{the end of the}} three hours the tanks were emptied and dragged along the <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> test further spans. The first six spans passed without problems, but under load the seventh span collapsed, {{bringing}} down the eighth and final span, leaving the pier head and pavilion standing.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Control': These rare <b>decks</b> tried <b>to</b> {{complete}} the secondary control victory condition. They were the harder <b>decks</b> <b>to</b> construct competitively.|$|R
5000|$|The PCTC has {{liftable}} <b>decks</b> <b>to</b> increase vertical clearance, {{as well as}} heavier decks for [...] "high-and-heavy" [...] cargo. A 6,500-unit car ship, with 12 decks, {{can have}} three decks which can take cargo up to 150 ST with liftable panels to increase clearance from 1.7 to 6.7 m on some <b>decks.</b> Lifting <b>decks</b> <b>to</b> accommodate higher cargo reduces the total capacity.|$|R
5000|$|Use of {{extensive}} <b>decking</b> <b>to</b> keep the traffic flowing over the cut while construction {{is in progress}} underneath.|$|R
5|$|The French van, pounded by British {{fire from}} both sides, {{had begun to}} surrender, and the victorious British ships {{continued}} to move down the line, bringing Brueys's 118-gun flagship Orient under constant heavy fire. Orient caught fire under this bombardment, and later exploded. Nelson briefly came on <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> direct the battle, but returned to the surgeon after watching the destruction of Orient.|$|E
5|$|The Sovetsky Soyuz-class {{ships were}} {{provided}} with aircraft facilities to handle two to four KOR-2 flying boats which would be launched by the two catapults mounted on the stern. Two hangars were built into the after end of the forecastle <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> house {{two of them and}} cranes were provided at the forward end of the quarterdeck to hoist them out of the water.|$|E
5|$|After {{consultation}} with Admiralty, Adams {{took advantage of}} this freedom to make four substantive changes to the Tartar design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the mizzen mast to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. The tiller was also relocated, from an exposed position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and near the stern. The vessel's hawseholes were relocated from the lower to the upper <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> allow additional storage space inside the hull. Finally, {{in recognition of the}} vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the bow in order to form a battery of chase guns.|$|E
50|$|The {{adaption}} of {{the building}} removed the original floor <b>decks</b> <b>to</b> create a new, triple-high foyer space running the length {{of the building}}.|$|R
50|$|Before digital {{recording}} became practical, instruments {{such as the}} phonogene (1950s) and the Mellotron (1960s) used analog tape <b>decks</b> <b>to</b> play back sampled sounds.|$|R
50|$|The plastic {{construction}} kit company Airfix {{produced a}} 1:144 scale {{model of the}} SR.N4 in the early 1970s, with a clear plastic top <b>decking</b> <b>to</b> show the detailed interior.|$|R
5|$|At 08:45 Rivoli, {{which had}} been {{struggling}} to reach the harbour of Trieste, lost her mizzenmast under fire from both Victorious and Weasel. Nearly at the same moment, two of her 36-pounder long guns exploded, killing or wounding 60 men, greatly disorganising and demoralising the others, and forcing Barré to transfer gunners from the upper gun <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> man his lower battery. Fifteen minutes later, with his ship unmanageable and battered, Commodore Barré surrendered. Rivoli had suffered over 400 killed and wounded from her crew of over 800, who had only assembled {{for the first time}} a few days before and had never sailed their ship in open water. Losses aboard Victorious were also heavy, with one officer and 25 sailors and marines killed and six officers (including Captain Talbot) and 93 men wounded.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Unicorn was {{considered}} for modernization {{to make her}} capable of operating modern, heavier jet aircraft. This would have required fitting of a steam catapult, reinforcing her flight <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> handle heavier aircraft and moving and enlarging her forward lift {{to make room for}} the new catapult and larger aircraft. A new crane would also have been necessary to handle the heavier aircraft. The Director of Naval Construction proposed to combine both of her hangars into a single one to eliminate problems with hangar height, but this was rejected because of the excessive cost. This reconstruction would have begun in July 1954, but the entire scheme was cancelled in November 1952 because providing existing carriers with angled flight decks was much more important.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, the British {{began to}} develop the first {{aircraft}} carriers by adding flying off and then landing <b>decks</b> <b>to</b> the large light cruiser Furious.|$|R
5000|$|Late November: Britain sent 26 Chariots to Malta, {{and they}} {{became part of the}} [...] "Tenth Submarine Flotilla". Three {{submarines}} received containers on their <b>decks</b> <b>to</b> carry the Chariots.|$|R

5|$|John Richard Deacon {{was born}} in Leicester on 19 August 1951, to Arthur Henry and Lilian Molly Deacon. His younger sister, Julie, was born five years later. His father worked at the Norwich Union {{insurance}} company and in 1960 {{the family moved to}} the dormitory town of Oadby. Deacon was known to friends and his bandmates as 'Deaks' or 'Deaky' and attended Linden Junior School in Leicester, Gartree High School and Beauchamp Grammar School in Oadby. He became interested in electronics, reading magazines on the subject and building small devices, including the modification of a reel to reel tape <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> record music directly off the radio. He studied well and achieved 8 GCE O level and 3 A level passes, all at grade A. He also enjoyed soul music in particular.|$|E
5|$|Rossia {{returned}} to Kronstadt, arriving on 8 April 1906, {{where she was}} given a lengthy refit that was finished in 1909. Her engines and boilers were reconditioned, her mainmast was removed and she received additional six-inch guns. Six more guns in lightly armored casemates were added on the upper deck, positioned on each side in the intervals between the main-deck six-inch guns. In addition the bow gun {{was moved to the}} upper <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> allow it to fire to each side. This increased the ship's broadside by four guns.|$|E
5|$|The BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 was {{a planned}} {{maritime}} patrol and attack aircraft intended {{to replace the}} Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2. The rebuilt aircraft would have extended the operating life of the Nimrod fleet by several decades and significantly improved the aircraft by installing more efficient Rolls-Royce BR700 turbofan jet engines to almost double the flight range. The conversion of the flight <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> a digital glass cockpit would have simplified control operations and reduced crew requirements. New detection systems were to be installed, as well as additional weapons for anti-submarine warfare.|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, two of Miller Freemans {{crew members}} [...] Lieutenant Edward R. Cassano, NOAA Corps, and Daniel W. Granstrom [...] {{received}} the Department of Commerce Silver Medal for {{their role in}} fighting a major fire that broke out aboard the ship {{while she was in}} port at Seattle. Cassano and Granstrom went below <b>decks</b> <b>to</b> fight the fire without regard for their own safety and over the course of an hour repeatedly led firefighters of the Seattle Fire Department below <b>decks</b> <b>to</b> guide them in extinguishing the blaze, only allowing themselves to be treated for heat exhaustion after the fire was under control.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, {{abnormally}} {{high temperatures}} caused the steel <b>decking</b> <b>to</b> expand {{to the point}} the bridge would not open or close properly. This necessitated the removal of about 1 in of the decking.|$|R
5|$|The {{aircraft}} scored {{four hits}} and three near misses on and around Arizona. The near miss off the port bow {{is believed to}} have caused observers to believe that the ship had been torpedoed, although no torpedo damage has been found. The sternmost bomb ricocheted off the face of Turret IV and penetrated the <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> detonate in the captain's pantry, causing a small fire. The next forwardmost hit was near the port edge of the ship, abreast the mainmast, probably detonating {{in the area of the}} anti-torpedo bulkhead. The next bomb struck near the port rear 5-inch AA gun.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} torpedo planes attacked Enterprise, South Dakota, and cruiser , but all {{of their}} torpedoes missed or failed, causing no damage. The engagement was over at 10:53; nine of the 16 torpedo aircraft were lost in this attack. After suppressing most of the onboard fires, at 11:15 Enterprise reopened her flight <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> begin landing returning aircraft from the morning U.S. strikes on the Japanese warship forces. However, only a few aircraft landed before {{the next wave of}} Japanese strike aircraft arrived and began their attacks on Enterprise, forcing a suspension of landing operations.|$|E
5|$|The ship's crew {{compartments}} {{were arranged}} {{such that the}} officers were accommodated in the forecastle. This arrangement {{was found to be}} unsatisfactory, and not repeated in later classes. Von der Tann was designed to be fitted with a lattice mast, but the ship received standard masts instead. In 1914, spotting posts were attached to the masts in order to observe the fall of artillery fire. In 1915, seaplane trials were conducted on Von der Tann, and a crane was attached on the aft <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> lift the seaplane aboard the ship. Von der Tann had originally been equipped with anti-torpedo nets, but these were removed towards the end of 1916.|$|E
50|$|Participants {{are unaware}} that 2 of the <b>decks</b> {{correspond}} <b>to</b> net winnings - low payoffs and even lower losses. The other 2 <b>decks</b> correspond <b>to</b> net losses - high payoffs and even higher losses.|$|R

25|$|Baumann was {{an early}} expert in {{light-weight}} construction techniques and placed the four engines in nacelles mounted between {{the upper and lower}} wing <b>decks</b> <b>to</b> distribute the loads to save weight in the wing spars.|$|R
5|$|After sailing {{for some}} hours, Leopard, {{commanded}} by Captain Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, approached Chesapeake and hailed {{a request to}} deliver dispatches to England, a customary request of the time. When a British lieutenant arrived by boat he handed Barron an order, given by Vice-Admiral George Berkeley of the Royal Navy, which instructed the British ships to stop and board Chesapeake to search for deserters. Barron refused to allow this search, and as the lieutenant returned to Leopard Barron ordered the crew to general quarters. Shortly afterward Leopard hailed Chesapeake; Barron could not understand the message. Leopard fired a shot across the bow, followed by a broadside, at Chesapeake. For fifteen minutes, while Chesapeake attempted to arm herself, Leopard continued to fire broadside after broadside until Barron struck his colors. Chesapeake only managed to fire one retaliatory shot after hot coals from the galley were brought on <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> ignite the cannon. The British boarded Chesapeake and carried off four crewmen, declining Barron's offer that Chesapeake {{be taken as a}} prize of war. Chesapeake had three sailors killed and Barron was among the 18wounded.|$|E
5|$|Before 1897, {{there had}} been a ferry at Grovehill, and a {{shipyard}} on the east bank, owned by Joseph Scarr. To assist his workers to reach the shipyard, Scarr designed and built a ferry bridge, which cost him £300. It consisted of a large rectangular pontoon, above which was fitted a bridge deck with handrails. Two jack screws enabled the <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> be raised or lowered in relation to the pontoon, so that it remained at approximately the same height, whatever the state of the tide. On the eastern bank, Scarr constructed a variable-height landing, but the landing on the west bank was constructed by Beverley Council, and was fixed. Scarr campaigned to have a variable landing here as well, and was prepared to fund it, but his requests were always rejected. The fixed landing made access to the bridge difficult at high tides. When a boat needed to pass, the west end was freed, and the pontoon swung round to lie parallel to the bank, either upstream or downstream, depending {{on the state of the}} tide. It would then be winched back into position by a small barrel winch. At night the bridge was closed and moored beside the bank.|$|E
5|$|HMS Campania was a {{seaplane}} {{tender and}} aircraft carrier, converted from an elderly ocean liner by the Royal Navy {{early in the}} First World War. After her conversion was completed in mid-1915 the ship spent her time conducting trials and exercises with the Grand Fleet. These revealed {{the need for a}} longer flight <b>deck</b> <b>to</b> allow larger aircraft to take off, and she was modified accordingly. Campania missed the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, but made a number of patrols with elements of the Grand Fleet. She never saw combat and was soon relegated to a training role because of her elderly machinery. In November 1918 Campania was anchored with the capital ships of the Grand Fleet when a sudden storm caused her anchors to drag. She hit several of the ships and the collisions punctured her hull; she slowly sank, with no loss of life.|$|E
