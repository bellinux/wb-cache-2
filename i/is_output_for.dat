40|$|We {{consider}} {{the situation where}} there are several alternatives for investing a quantity of money to achieve a set of objectives. The choice of which alternative to apply depends on how citizens and political representatives perceive that such objectives should be achieved. All citizens {{with the right to}} vote can express their preferences in the decision-making process. These preferences may be incomplete. Political representatives represent the citizens who have not taken part in the decision-making process. The weight corresponding to political representatives depends on the number of citizens that have intervened in the decision-making process. The methodology we propose needs the participants to specify for each alternative how they rate the different attributes and the relative importance of attributes. On the basis of this information an expected utility interval <b>is</b> <b>output</b> <b>for</b> each alternative. To do this, an evidential reasoning approach is applied. This approach improves the insightfulness and rationality of the decision-making process using a belief decision matrix for problem modeling and the Dempster?Shafer theory of evidence for attribute aggregation. Finally, we propose using the distances of each expected utility interval from the maximum and the minimum utilities to rank the alternative set. The basic idea is that an alternative is ranked first if its distance to the maximum utility is the smallest, and its distance to the minimum utility is the greatest. If only one of these conditions is satisfied, a distance ratio is then used...|$|E
40|$|Extended Abstract – The general goal of query-based {{learning}} algorithms for finite-state machines is {{to identify}} a machine, usually of minimum size, that agrees with an a priori fixed (class of) machines. For this, queries on how the underlying system behaves may be issued. A popular setup is that of Angluin’s L ∗ algorithm[Ang 87], here adapted {{to the case of}} finite-state machines, in which a minimal deterministic finite-state machine for a regular language is learned based on so-called membership and equivalence queries. Using a pictorial language, we have a learner whose job is {{to come up with the}} automaton to learn, a teacher who may answer the output for a given input string as well an oracle answering whether the automaton H currently proposed by the learner is correct or not. This setting is depicted in Figure 1 (a) (though assume that the don’t know is not there). In Angluin’s setting, a teacher will always answer with the correct output symbol. In many application scenarios, however, parts of the machine to learn are not completely specified or not observable. Then, queries may be answered inconclusively, by don’t know, also denoted by?. In the full version of this paper [GL 06], we study a learning algorithm (and variants thereof), called ABSAT, ABSATI, and ABSATI 2, that are designed to work with such an inexperienced teacher. The oracle, however, does not change its functionality in the setting discussed here (see Figure 1 (a), the don’t know is new). What <b>is</b> <b>output</b> <b>for</b> input string u?

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to develop {{computer}} programs {{for use in a}} hybrid system for electronic music synthesis. The system consists of a D 17 B Minuteman computer and an Arp 2500 synthesizer. The programs enable a user to create control signals with the D 17 B for use in any Arp patch. Up to 511 distinct voltage events may be specified. A voltage event is defined as a discrete voltage or as a continuous (ramp) voltage during a specified duration period. A discrete voltage remains constant over the duration. A continuous voltage changes linearly over the duration period. A voltage event is defined in the range of 0 to + 10 Volts. An event duration is defined in the range of zero to thirty seconds in any increment of one-tenth of a second. The project was achieved in three steps. First, the user inputs data to the D 17 B memory describing the voltage events. Next, a program is executed to convert the data to a form usable by the computer. Third, a program is executed which outputs two control signals. One control signal outputs the voltage event; it is used with any voltage-controlled device on the Arp. A pulse signal <b>is</b> <b>output</b> <b>for</b> each voltage event; it is used as a gate for an envelope generator. This hybrid system expands the capabilities of the Arp. It may be used in place of the Arp sequencer to create longer sequences of control signals. The programs give the user exact control over the voltage value and duration of each voltage event.

Here we explore {{the application of the}} CRF model to ASR processing by building a system that performs first-pass phonetic recogintion using discriminatively trained phonetic attributes. This system achieves an accuracy level in a phone recognition task superior to that of an HMM that has been comparably trained. Phonetic Attributes • Phonetic attributes are defined via linguistic properties per the International Phonetics Association (IPA) phonetic chart • Consonants defined by their sonority, voicing, manner, and place of articulation • Vowels defined by their sonority, voicing, height, frontness, roundness and tenseness • Additional features for silence • Phonetic attributes extracted by multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural net classifiers • Classifiers are trained on 12 th order cepstral PLP and delta coefficients derived from the speech data • Speech data is broken up into frames of 25 ms, with overlapping frames starting every 10 ms • Input is a vector of PLP and delta coefficients for a nine frame window, centered on the current frame, with four frames of context on either side • Each classifier outputs a series of posterior probabilities representing the probability of the attribute given the data • One probability <b>is</b> <b>output</b> <b>for</b> each possible attribute for that classifier for any given frame of the data • These posteriors sum to one for a given classifier MLP • Classifiers were trained using phonetically transcribed corpus • Phonetic attribute labels were derived by using the attributes provided by the IPA description of the transcribed phone (See Figure 1) • For our purposes, all phones are assumed to have their canonical values for training, and attribute boundaries occur at phonetic boundarie...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{inspection}} {{process planning}} (IPP) for large volume metrology (LVM) attracts increasing attention in manufacturing and assembly {{industries such as}} aerospace and automotive, where large and complex assemblies and fabrications with complex surfaces are employed. Inspection is conventionally considered as a quality control manner. But there is changing shift to processes that are more related to the early design stage aiming to increase product performance and reduce costs by automation and elimination of rework. This is especially evident in the standardisation and implementation of Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) of new products and systems at the design stage. This study proposes a GD&T based systematic framework for the IPP of LVM systems within a digital environment. Orientating to solve the “what to measure” and “how to measure” problems in IPP, the prototype system has seven functional core modules including: tolerance feature analysis, instrument selection, inspection point selection, accessibility and visibility analysis, instrument setup and configuration, clustering analysis and measurement sequencing. An optimized inspection plan <b>is</b> <b>output</b> <b>for</b> the designer to evaluate the product design {{as well as for}} guiding the metrologist and process planner to conduct the inspection process. Heuristic rules, evolutionary algorithms and modern computational graphic techniques have been adopted to facilitate the supported functions. Coupled with state of art metrology systems, metrology and CAD software, the framework is able to work effectively and efficiently by means of incorporating international standards and industrial best practice. It is the first attempt to successfully minimise manual activities in the planning process for LVM systems, which results in improved efficiency, enhanced decision making and a better inspection plan overall. Two case studies have been conducted to validate the functionalities of the prototype system...|$|E
