40|$|We have {{investigated}} the crystallization of amorphous germanium films on GaAs crystals using nanosecond laser pulses. The structure and composition of the crystallized layers is dominated by nonequilibrium effects induced by the fast cooling process following laser irradiation. Perfect epitaxial films are obtained for <b>fluencies</b> that completely melt the Ge film, but not the substrate. For higher <b>fluencies,</b> partial melting of the substrate leads {{to the formation of}} a (GaAs) (1 -x) Ge- 2 x epitaxial alloy with a graded composition profile at the interface with the substrate. Since Ge and GaAs are thermodynamically immiscible in the solid phase, the formation of the alloy is attributed to the suppression of phase separation during the fast cooling process. Lower laser <b>fluencies</b> lead to polycrystalline layers with a patterned surface structure. The latter is attributed to the freeze-in of instabilities in the melt during the fast solidification process. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

Those interested in gaming literacies view game design as a way to engage youth in reflective and critical reading of the gaming culture. In this paper, we propose the concept of “gaming fluencies” to promote game design as a context in which youth not only learn to read but also to produce digital media in creative ways. Gaming <b>fluencies</b> also present the added benefit of addressing equity issues of participation in the new media literacy landscape. We report on an ethnographic study that documented urban youth producing digital games in a community technology center. Our analyses focus on an archive of 643 game designs collected over a 24 -month period, selecting a random sample to identify evidence of creative and technical dimensions in game designs. In addition, we highlight three case studies of game designs to identify different pathways into the participatory culture. Our goal is to illustrate how gaming <b>fluencies</b> allow {{for a wide range of}} designs, provide low thresholds and high ceilings for complex projects, and make room for creative expression. In our discussion, we address how gaming <b>fluencies</b> represent a complementary pathway for learning and participation in today’s media culture...|$|R

In this work, we compare conventional silicon detectors (p-on-n type diodes over a 300 μm thick wafer substrates) with thinned devices (50 - 100 μm thick). The performance of these structures have been studied by means of a three defect level radiation damage model, implemented in the SYNOPSYS-TCAD device simulator. The effects of the radiation fluence on the effective doping concentration (Neff), leakage current and charge collection efficiency (CCE) have been investigated up to irradiation <b>fluencies</b> of 1016 1 MeV neutron-equivalent/cm 2.
