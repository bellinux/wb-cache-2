A week later, the team met President Clinton at the White House and flew with <b>Hillary</b> <b>and</b> Chelsea Clinton on Air Force One to Cape Canaveral. Her leadership and performance at the 1999 World Cup cemented Hamm as a soccer icon.|$|E

5|$|On April 12, 2015, Clinton {{formally}} {{announced her}} candidacy {{for the presidency}} in the 2016 election. She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for <b>Hillary</b> <b>and</b> Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure. The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Focuses of her campaign included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act. Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination, Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties.|$|E

25|$|On 15 February 2006, a {{group of}} 31 {{prominent}} New Zealanders signed an open letter, published as a full-page newspaper advertisement, calling for better quality programmes and less advertising on TVNZ. These included mountaineer Sir Edmund <b>Hillary,</b> <b>and</b> former governors-general Sir Michael Hardie Boys and Dame Catherine Tizard.

25|$|On 8 June 1924, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made {{an attempt}} on the summit via the North Col-North Ridge-Northeast Ridge route from which they never returned. On 1 May 1999, the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition found Mallory's body on the North Face in a snow basin below and {{to the west of}} the {{traditional}} site of CampVI. Controversy has raged in the mountaineering community whether one or both of them reached the summit 29years before the confirmed ascent and safe descent of Everest by Sir Edmund <b>Hillary</b> <b>and</b> Tenzing Norgay in 1953.|$|E
25|$|Debuting on June 29, 1994, Models Inc. was {{produced}} by Spelling Television and created by Charles Pratt, Jr. and Frank South.

Also present was Hillary's son David (Brian Gaskill), the loyal, valiant, and occasionally hot-headed {{vice president of the}} company.

25|$|Mt. Everest has {{two main}} {{climbing}} routes, the southeast ridge from Nepal {{and the north}} ridge from Tibet, {{as well as many}} other less frequently climbed routes. Of the two main routes, the southeast ridge is technically easier and more frequently used. It was the route used by Edmund <b>Hillary</b> <b>and</b> Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996. This was, however, a route decision dictated more by politics than by design, as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after the People's Republic of China invaded Tibet.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} Hillary's {{team had}} set up Scott Basewhich was to be Fuchs' final destinationon {{the opposite side of}} the continent at McMurdo Sound on the Ross Sea.

25|$|News of the expedition's success reached London on {{the morning}} of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, 2 June. Returning to Kathmandu a few days later, Hunt (a Briton) and Hillary (a New Zealander) {{discovered}} that they had been promptly knighted in the Order of the British Empire for the ascent.

George Fink responds (Nature 2002) that asserting that the boycott of South Africa by the world's academic communities 'was instrumental in ending apartheid in South Africa' is a deception and was actually terminated by two pivotal and interrelated political events: strict economic sanctions on South Africa imposed by the United States Congress in 1986 and measures by South Africa president F. W. de Klerk in 1989 and 1990.|$|E
25|$|A {{few months}} later, during President Clinton's state visit to China, his wife <b>Hillary</b> <b>and</b> Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited the synagogue. Rabbi Schneier resanctified Ohel Rachel for the {{occasion}} using a Torah brought from New York City, which he then donated to the local Jewish community. In September 1999, a Rosh Hashanah service {{was held at the}} synagogue {{for the first time since}} 1952. The same year, the synagogue was separately visited by Israeli President Ezer Weizmann and by German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. The areas of the building refurbished for these visits were then used as a lecture hall, although Jews were permitted to observe holidays such as Purim, Passover, Rosh Hashanah, and Hanukkah on site.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hillary</b> <b>and</b> Tenzing {{were the}} first climbers to ascend this step, and they did so using {{primitive}} ice climbing equipment and ropes. Nowadays, climbers ascend this step using fixed ropes previously set up by Sherpas. Once above the step, it is a comparatively easy {{climb to the top}} on moderately angled snow slopes—though the exposure on the ridge is extreme, especially while traversing large cornices of snow. With increasing numbers of people climbing the mountain in recent years, the Step has frequently become a bottleneck, with climbers forced to wait significant amounts of time for their turn on the ropes, leading to problems in getting climbers efficiently up and down the mountain.|$|E

25|$|Noël Agazarian {{joined the}} Royal Air Force as a Volunteer Reservist and was {{commissioned}} {{as a pilot}} officer on 14 February 1939. He completed his initial flying training {{at the same time}} as Richard Hillary, at RAF Lossiemouth, after which both were assigned to RAF Old Sarum, to train as army co-operation pilots. They flew Westland Lysander liaison aircraft and Hawker Hector biplanes; during the training, Agazarian crashed a Hawker Hector but was unscathed. By the time his course ended (June 1940) France had fallen, the Dunkirk evacuation had taken place and a German invasion of Britain was thought to be imminent. Because of this crisis, <b>Hillary</b> <b>and</b> Agazarian were both amongst the majority of pilots from the graduating Army co-operation class who were immediately reassigned as fighter pilots, something that pleased Agazarian immensely.|$|E
25|$|Hillary {{has been}} to Everest five times, once {{reaching}} 8,300 metres on the West Ridge and twice reaching the summit by the South Col route. With his first summit of Mount Everest in 1990, he and Sir Edmund became the first father and son to achieve the feat. His second ascent in May 2002 {{was part of a}} National Geographic Society expedition to mark the 50th anniversary of Sir Edmund <b>Hillary</b> <b>and</b> Tenzing Norgay's historic first ascent in 1953. The anniversary expedition brought together Peter Hillary, Jamling Norgay and Brent Bishop, the sons of Sir Edmund, Tenzing Norgay, and Dr Barry Bishop, a member of the first successful American team to reach the summit in 1963. The 1990 expedition was led by veteran Everest climber Pete Athans, who holds the record for the most summits of Everest by a Western climber.|$|E
