500|$|The song proved {{popular with}} both {{young and old}} listeners. The public enjoyed hearing a {{supergroup}} of musicians singing together on one track, and felt satisfied in buying the record, knowing that the money would go towards a good cause. People reported they bought more than one copy of the single, some buying up to five copies of the record. One mother from Columbia, Missouri purchased two copies of [...] "We Are the World", stating, [...] "The record is excellent whether it's for a cause or not. It's fun trying to identify the different artists. It was a good feeling knowing that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> someone in need." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pope Damasus {{appointed}} St Jerome as his confidential secretary. Invited to Rome originally to a synod of 382 convened {{to end the}} schism of Antioch, he {{made himself}} indispensable to the pope, and took a prominent place in his councils. Jerome spent three years (382–385) in Rome in close intercourse with Pope Damasus and the leading Christians. Writing in 409, Jerome remarked, [...] "A great many years ago when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> Damasus, bishop of Rome with his ecclesiastical correspondence, and writing his {{answers to the questions}} referred to him by the councils of the east and west..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robertson {{replaced}} [...] "Fast" [...] Eddie Clarke as {{the lead}} guitarist of Motörhead in May 1982. He recorded the band's 1983 King Biscuit Flower Hour sessions andAnother Perfect Day, his only studio album with the group. [...] "That felt totally uncertain," [...] he told Classic Rock. [...] "It only came about because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> out some friends and, when {{they asked me to}} join officially, I said, 'Okay, but I'm not fucking rewriting the Ace of Spades." [...] His last appearance with Motörhead was at the Metropol in Berlin, on 11 November 1983. His resistance to playing [...] "classic" [...] Motörhead songs, coupled with a playing style that did not fit well with Motörhead's aggressive music, resulted in his departure. After leaving Motörhead, Robertson joined Gary Barden's band Statetrooper and remained until they disbanded.|$|E

60|$|I made a 'pome' yesterday, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> Hannah wash, and as Father likes my silly little things, I {{put it in}} {{to amuse}} him. Give him my lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss {{yourself}} a dozen times for your...|$|E

"He was peeking {{through his}} glasses at the camp, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> pepper, the General's sow-belly--just as usual--when {{he turns to}} me quick and says, 'Almighty! How all these Englishmen are liars! You cannot trust one,' he says. 'Captain Mankeltow tells our Johanna he comes not back till Tuesday, and to-day is Friday, and there he is! Almighty! The English are all Chamberlains!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not that I know of, {{except that}} he might have got cross when he was at the well, and thought I ought to have treated one of the proprietors with a little more deference. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> set the drills when he came out last, and I'm not sure but that I spoke sharply when I {{answered}} his questions; but I didn't intend to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, you did,' she assented; 'and, though I may say {{no great}} things as to {{happiness}} came of it, I've always seen that your intentions towards me were none the less noble on that account. I {{would do for}} you what I would do for no other man, and there is one reason in particular which inclines me {{to help you with}} Avice--that I should feel absolutely certain <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> her to a kind husband.' ...|$|E
60|$|The next instant, to the perplexity and consternation of the owner, Charley {{was on top}} of Big Alec in the cockpit, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> bind {{him with}} gaskets. The owner was dancing excitedly about and {{demanding}} an explanation, but by that time Big Alec's partner had crawled aft from the bowsprit and was peering apprehensively over the rail into the cockpit. Charley's arm shot around his neck and the man landed on his back beside Big Alec.|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{think that}} this is the laziest life that a man could find—there is not a blamed thing to do except lay around, sleep and go 'bug house'. But the same, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>helping</b> to bear the 'White Man's Burden'." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gray {{was known}} for her support of junior colleagues. One wrote {{of the time he}} was working in Bell Laboratories in 1957, 'In calculation, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helped</b> by a little old lady, Marion Gray, one of Bell's finest mathematicians at that time.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hate {{telling you}} these things. It is you ... If you didn't mind ... But {{you make it}} all different. I could do it--if it wasn't for you. I was ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> ... I had gone meaning to help if {{anything}} went wrong at Mr. Lagune's. Yes--that night. No ... don't! It was too hard before to tell you. But I really did not feel it ... until I saw you there. Then all at once I felt shabby and mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His was an impenetrable darkness. I {{looked at}} him as you peer down at a man who is lying {{at the bottom of a}} precipice where the sun never shines. But I had not much time to give him, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> the engine-driver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders, to {{straighten}} a bent connecting-rod, and in other such matters. I lived in an infernal mess of rust, filings, nuts, bolts, spanners, hammers, ratchet-drills--things I abominate, because I don't get on with them. I tended the little forge we fortunately had aboard; I toiled wearily in a wretched scrap-heap--unless I had the shakes too bad to stand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad I am here, master," [...] the {{boy said}} earnestly, with tears in his eyes. [...] "I don't mind if they hang me; I would rather {{anything}} than go on as I have been doing. I knew it must come, and whenever I heard anyone walk into the shop I made {{sure it was a}} constable. I am ready to tell everything, master; I know I deserve whatever I shall get, but that won't hurt me half as much as it has done, having to go on living in the house with you, and knowing <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> to rob you all along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hilda," [...] I cried, leaning forward, with quiverings of my heart, [...] "I {{will help}} you in {{whatever}} way you will allow me. But let me at any rate help you with the feeling that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>helping</b> one who means in time--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think so}} too; but I have seen people hide {{it better than}} he. You see <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>helped</b> by a habit I have of {{dividing}} people into classes, into types. <b>I</b> may easily <b>be</b> mistaken about your brother as an individual, but his type is written on his whole person." ...|$|R

60|$|I shuddered as I {{bent over}} to touch him, and every sense in me revolted at the contact, but I had to search, or I was lost. The coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar war to those horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the key. Then I {{stopped and looked at}} the Count. There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> to {{transfer}} to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't mind that. It's {{easy when}} people ask you for food or money, but the horrible thing is when they ask you for work. Think of me, who never did {{anything}} to earn a cent in my life, being humbly asked by a fellow-creature to let him work for something to eat and drink! It's hideous! It's abominable! At first I used to be flattered by it, and try to conjure up something for them to do, and to believe that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> the deserving poor. Now I give all of them money, {{and tell them that}} they needn't even pretend to work for it. I don't work for my money, and I don't see why they should." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{one morning}} old Mrs. Gurley, the widow lady, got gossipy while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> her string beans {{on the back}} porch, and began to gush information, as folks who rent out their rooms usually do. Mr. Lyle was her idea of a saint on earth--as he was mine, too. She went over all his virtues and graces, and wound up by telling me that Arthur had had an {{extremely}} romantic love-affair, not long before, that had ended unhappily. She didn't {{seem to be on}} to the details, but she knew that he had been hit pretty hard. He was paler and thinner, she said, and he had some kind of a remembrance or keepsake of the lady in a little rosewood box that he kept locked in his desk drawer in his study.|$|E

50|$|In 238 AD Thysdrus was at {{the center}} of a {{struggle}} to control the Roman Empire: Gordian <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helped</b> by a riot of Thysdrus citizens and because of them was named emperor. All this happened after Maximinus Thrax killed Emperor Alexander Severus at Moguntiacum in Germania Inferior and assumed the throne.|$|R
6000|$|... "I own <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helped</b> by {{inquiries}} about your habits," [...] said the doctor, smiling. [...] "If {{you like a}} game, try pool, with boys like yourself, and bet fifty cents. I don't know about your bank-roll, but your heart and nerve won't stand for hundred-dollar pots when your antagonists are men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be angry, Jim dear--but {{it was all}} my fault--and I didn't tell you. I {{knew all}} about the deserter, and I gave him the clothes and things that they say he stole. It was while you was out that night, and he came and begged of me, and was mournful and hidjus to behold. I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> him, and getting our revenge on the Fort, {{all at the same}} time. Don't be mad, Jim dear, and do not be frighted fer me. I'm going over thar to make it all right--to free HIM of {{stealing}}--to have YOU left out of it all--and take it all on myself. Don't you be a bit feared for me. I ain't skeert of the wind or of going. I'll close reef everything, clear the creek, stretch across to Injen Island, hugg the Point, and bear up fer Logport. Dear Jim--don't get mad--but I couldn't bear this fooling of you nor HIM--and that man being took for stealing any longer!--Your loving sister, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{much of a}} story, for {{the plan}} worked {{as if it had}} been greased, though I'm free to confess that I had but little hope of pulling through when I left you. My heart was thumping fit to burst when I called for the officer on duty, holding my head high as if General Gage had been my brother. The {{lieutenant}} who gave me a hearing was by no means the dullard you might have expected him to be, and eyed me in a way that wasn't comforting. Of course I had to explain that Master Lord wasn't quite in condition to venture out, and that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> him in setting a trap for the rebels. While you might have counted twenty I felt certain he was minded to send to headquarters to learn if the order was all right, and I made bold to urge that a delay of half an hour would set all our plans awry, which you'll agree was nothing more than solemn truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{little time}} after <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> King George V to get crowned, by walking round a local bonfire and {{listening}} to a local band. Just as a bonfire cannot be too big, so (by my theory of music) a band cannot be too loud, and this band was so loud, emphatic, and obvious, that I actually recognised {{one or two of}} the tunes. And I noticed that quite a formidable proportion of them were Jacobite tunes; that is, tunes that had been primarily meant to keep George V out of his throne for ever. Some of the real airs of the old Scottish rebellion were played, such as [...] "Charlie is My Darling," [...] or [...] "What's a' the steer, kimmer?" [...] songs that men had sung while marching to destroy and drive out the monarchy under which we live. They were songs in which the very kinsmen of the present King were swept aside as usurpers. They were songs in which the actual words [...] "King George" [...] occurred as a curse and a derision. Yet they were played to celebrate his very Coronation; played as promptly and innocently as if they had been [...] "Grandfather's Clock" [...] or [...] "Rule Britannia" [...] or [...] "The Honeysuckle and the Bee." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{my father}} gave way, to my delight and relief. For {{if he had}} not, what chance would there have been of my getting some still more {{important}} words with Marie? So having collected the geese and the two falcons, which I proposed to skin for Marie, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>helped</b> into the cart, and we drove off, reaching Maraisfontein just as night set in.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is quite}} well, Lorna said. And {{they are getting}} along well now. Lorna hinted that a relative--an uncle, <b>I</b> think, <b>was</b> <b>helping</b> them." ...|$|R
50|$|Yesterday was the ten-mile bicycle race. Three started. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> one. <b>I</b> ran the {{distance}} in 34 minutes, being the fastest time, amateur or professional, on record. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{not at all}} exhausted... Today <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to amuse the public by riding an 86-inch bicycle to Trumpington and back. There is a little scale of steps up it, up which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>helped,</b> and then started off and left to myself. It is great fun riding this leviathan: it creates such an extraordinary sensation among the old dons {{who happen to be}} passing.|$|R
