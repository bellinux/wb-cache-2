500|$|Despite being {{based on}} a New Orleans funk sample, the song belies a strong go-go influence. [...] Harrison likened the two based on their heavy use of {{percussion}} and chant. Amerie stated, [...] "You don't hear go-go outside of D.C. ... I was like, 'We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> an up-tempo way because when you hear {{it on the radio}} in D.C., it's fast.' ... So it's a fresh sound for everybody but people in the D.C./Maryland/Virginia area. They [...] know what it is." [...] The song is composed in the key of D # minor, moving at a tempo of 100 beats per minute in common time. [...] It uses four-measure phrases with a VIb-I-VIIb-VIb-IV chord progression. [...] The first four chords are played on the measure's downbeat, and off-beat syncopation is used for the fifth chord.|$|E

500|$|The first single, [...] "Heroin", was {{accompanied}} {{with the most}} music videos, {{with a total of}} five for several different remixed versions of the cover. Each was a [...] "Blendo" [...] video which rapidly shifted random imagery and colours in time with the music. Four of the music videos for the song were directed by Brett Leonard, with a fifth being credited to Howard Deutch. Each used stock footage shot by Idol and Leonard, filmed personally and edited on Idol's computer. Idol did so with the intention of sending a [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] message that mocked and rejected the standards of MTV music video creation. [...] "We did it all on camcorder and we sort of wanted to say {{you can make your own}} videos, and you don't always <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a very MTV way." [...] None were released for rotation on television; instead, one was included in the video album release, Cyberpunk: Shock to the System.|$|E

[...] The tour launched September 15 in Ohio, stopping at 30 {{locations in the}} United States, to promote their album, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. Supporting were Alkaline Trio and Reggie and the Full Effect. This tour {{marked the beginning of}} the heavy theatrics later showcased in many of their live shows. Way expressed his plans for the tour in an interview with MTV, saying, [...] "we'd talked about bringing out dancers for our headlining tour in the fall, but it's a big undertaking; you have to have a bus full of dancers. We've always wanted to do a big theatrical tour. But you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> steps". The use of theatrics was evident during The Black Parade World Tour, which supported their album of the same name. The tour featured 133 performances worldwide, featuring three legs in North America, one in Europe, Asia, and South America, and one internationally.|$|E

'It is paid now for a reform,' he said, 'and when the reform is obtained, no doubt the State would feel itself so much indebted to us all, that it would tax the late landlords until we got all our money back again, and more too." ...|$|E
