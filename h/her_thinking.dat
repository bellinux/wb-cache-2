He returns the next day to find that Fatboy has not been discovered, and from how scared Fatboy is, realises something is wrong.

However, soldiers from the country of Gadoria attack during the ceremony attempting to kill <b>her</b> <b>thinking</b> she willfully sided with Vaclav, with Fenimore jumping {{in the way of}} one of their blades and dying instead.

Senel and his friends go after her, passing through the deeper areas of the ship where they discover from fractured recordings that the Legacy was a colony ship from another world, and the Ferines came to the planet and made war with the Orerines 4000 years ago. Arriving at Maurits' stronghold, the party faces Walter, who reveals his jealousy over Shirley choosing Senel over him, and fights until his life gives out.

After he is beaten and Shirley brought back to her senses, Maurits summons a physical manifestation of Nerifes itself, which is driven back by Senel and his friends.
