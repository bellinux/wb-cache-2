40|$|One {{of the key}} {{objectives}} {{of this paper is}} to identify the impacts of <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> on firm performance. Although there have been a number of research that examined the relationship between SME internationalisation and firm performance, research from the context of smaller developing economies are really scant. This is against the fact that SMEs are main vehicle for growth in those economies and extensive research on various dimensions of SMEs including its impact on firm performance may help to better understand the operational aspects of SMEs in those economies. Using primary data and structural equation modelling to analyse those data, the paper has found that <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> has significant impact on both financial and non-financial performance of SMEs in Bangladesh. More specifically, the paper has found that internationalisation impacts in two dimensions (Financial impacts and non-financial impacts) with 8 indicators (higher sales, higher profit, assets maximization, market expansion, competitive advantage, better reputation, better customer service and added knowledge) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} 15 years, several Traditional SMEs internationalised their production, quite often to take {{advantage}} of low labour costs. Many of them internationalised production in countries where they did not have previous selling presence. This paper aims at drawing research attention to this internationalisation model that we call Production-Oriented <b>Internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SME.</b> Firstly, we show that existing theories on SMEs internationalisation do not explain Production-Oriented <b>Internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> Traditional <b>SMEs.</b> Subsequently, we propose a framework to direct the research on this issue. More specifically, we propose to focus the research on both the changes that are stimulated by this kind <b>of</b> <b>internationalisation</b> and on the consequent impact on SMEs competitiveness. Finally, we present three cases of such kind <b>of</b> <b>internationalisation.</b> The considered <b>SMEs</b> performed a number of internal changes during the Production-Oriented Internationalisation. Consequently to this process, SMEs gained sustainable competitive advantages. The empirical analysis is still on going and deserves a more thorough investigation. However, it suggests that the Production-Oriented Internationalisation is a phenomenon with both complex and potentially positive implications. The fact that several Traditional SMEs may undertake such a kind <b>of</b> <b>internationalisation</b> process makes this Production-Oriented <b>Internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> significant practical relevance...|$|R

40|$|Several reasons {{underlie}} the increased efforts towards internationalisation by {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) including the emergence of global and niche industries, technological developments and the increased importance of global networks and alliances (Etemad, 2004). Positioned within the field of international entrepreneurship, this study addresses the following broad research problem: {{what is the role of}} top management, networks and external environment on the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> operating in the Australian food and beverage sector? A multi-theoretical approach is used to examine this research problem. This study draws on internationalisation theory (Johanson & Vahlne, 1977, 2009), the resource-based view (Barney, 1991), the knowledge-based view (Grant, 1996), network theory (Granovetter, 1973; Johansson & Mattson, 1988) and entrepreneurship theory (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). While previous research highlights the role of top management, networks and external-environment on the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs,</b> opportunities for further research exist. In addition, there are concerns that the field of international entrepreneurship remains dominated by research on international new ventures (IN V s) (Keupp & Gassman, 2009). In addressing these concerns, the broad research problem is examined across three categories of SMEs: INVs (defined as SMEs that have commenced internationalisation less than three years from inception), late international SMEs (defined as SMEs that commenced internationalisation after three years from inception), and domestic SMEs (defined as SMEs that are over three years of age and have not yet internationalised). The three research questions addressed in the present study are as follows: 1. What is the role of top management on the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs?</b> 2. What is the role of networks on the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs?</b> 3. What is the role of the external environment on the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs?</b> To examine the role of top management, networks and external environment on internationalisation, the present study employed a multiple case-study approach comprising fifteen SMEs from the Australian food and beverage (F&B) sector. This sector plays an important role in the development of Australia's economy (Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry, 2008), however it is undergoing rapid changes associated with the increasing globalisation of food production and retail markets and significant rationalisation and integration of the supply chain (Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry, 2007 a). In light of these changes, it is crucial that Australian F&B SMEs are able to compete effectively at home and in foreign markets. Despite this, only a small number of studies have examined internationalisation within the Australian context (Fischer, 2004). In addressing Research Question 1, the present study identifies four managerial mindset characteristics that explain internationalisation. These are: cosmopolitanism, cognitive complexity, risk tolerance and commitment to internationalisation. With regard to Research Question 2, the findings contribute towards an understanding of how smaller firms differ in their development and utilisation of networks for internationalisation. The study also highlights the importance of strong international business relationships, and explicates the opportunity costs and network rigidity resulting from existing networks, which may affect internationalisation. In addressing Research Question 3, four salient external environment forces are identitied to explain why some Australian F&B SMEs internationalise and others stay focussed primarily on the domestic market. These are domestic push forces relating to threats from a consolidated retail sector, domestic pull forces relating to sustainability in a small domestic market, international pull forces relating to the perceived superiority ofproduct in international markets, and international push forces relating to competitive pressures abroad. In applying a multi-theoretical approach to examine intemationalisation across three groups of SMEs, the findings of the present study extend existing theoretical and empirical literature within the field of international entrepreneurship. In addition, the study contributes to practice. From a managerial perspective, the findings may provide managers with a framework upon which to evaluate their firm's internationalisation against the internationalisation of others in the industry. They may also be able to gauge the effect of their firms' managerial mindsets and networks on intemationalisation given the nature of the external environment. Government policy-makers may be able to use these findings to develop new or existing initiatives to assist SME managers operating within the Australian F&B sector internationalise. The present study also provides empirical contributions and suggestions to further existing research...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} assumption in {{the small}} business literature is that the competitive advantages of {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) are rooted in their organisational flexibility. However, prior research tends to view the effects of different types of organisational flexibility as homogeneous. In the context of the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> from emerging markets, this article proposes that different types of organisational flexibility influence the extent to which SMEs can benefit from their internationalisation. Using a sample of Chinese SMEs, the study shows that strategic flexibility helps emerging market SMEs benefit from their internationalisation, but that operational flexibility weakens the main effect. Finally, structural flexibility has no significant influence on the internationalisation–performance relationship. 26 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{internalisation}} {{of small}} and medium sized firms (SMES) is emerging as an area of research interest as {{an increasing number of}} such firms become actively engaged in international activity, often from inception. All available literature reveals that conventional theories were mainly developed to describe the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> large multinationals companies MNC and not SME(s). This study provides an overview of the macro economics as well as the microeconomic theory that supports the process of intemationalisation of firms. Furthermore, each theory was critically analysed in relation to their limitations, as well as their theoretical contribution to the process <b>of</b> the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SME.</b> A theoretical model was developed from the literature review. The objective was to investigate which factors (firms' and decision-makers' characteristics), in the Portuguese and UK textile, clothing and knitwear sectors are associated with export performance. Results indicated consistency in the findings relating to firms' SIze, competitive advantages, ability to speak foreign languages and nationality, for several dimensions of export behaviour. However, the factors: age, international experience, risk perception. cost perception and profitability perception are not supported as being influential to export performance in this study.

40|$|Research on firm {{internationalisation}} {{has tended}} to focus on Large Enterprises(LEs), with relatively less focus on Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs), despite the importance of SMEs in generating national employment and economic development. In many countries the government has acknowledged SMEs as a key source of domestic income growth and employment creation, most particularly from export activities. Studies on <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs,</b> however, have been predominantly focused on developed countries. This study therefore is focused on the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> from Indonesia, which represents developing countries. Most studies of exporting SMEs focus on macroeconomic factors such as regulation, infrastructure and programs which assist SME development. On the other hand, management literature has recognised the important roles of senior managers in terms of their management know‐how and international business skills as human capital which can influence the export activity of the firm. At the same time, social capital is also recognised a further resource needed for SME internationalisation. Therefore this research will address this gap in order to examine the role of entrepreneur’s human and social capital in internationalisation of the firm. Further to this, findings on the relationship between firm internationalisation and firm performance are mixed. More specifically, the effect of <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> on business performance has not been seriously investigated. This study therefore seeks to fill this gap by examining the unique effect of different dimensions of internationalisation on business performance. Overall, this study has three purposes: the first is to measure company resources (Human and Social Capital) influencing Indonesia’s manufacturing exporting SMEs in their internationalisation process; the second is to examine the effect of human and social capital in relation to three dimensions of internationalisation (international performance, number of markets and time to internationalise); and the third is to assess the effect of the aforementioned internationalisation dimensions on firm financial performance. This study used a mixed method combining quantitative and qualitative approaches. The quantitative data was drawn from 241 SMEs’ managers and/or owners who have exporting activities from a total of approximately 3 million SMEs based on the Indonesian government database. The qualitative data was collected through interviews with ten SMEs owner‐managers who were participating in the survey. Using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique, the findings suggest that Management Know‐How have no positive relationship with any dimension of internationalisation, but, interestingly, it has a negative relationship with time for internationalisation; suggesting that it delays the internationalisation of the firms. The findings also show that both International Business Skills and Social Capital skills have a positive relationship with international performance and number of exporting markets, but not with time for internationalisation. With regard to the effect of internationalisation on business performance, the findings show that international performance has no effect on business performance, but the number of export market has a positive relationship with business performance. On the other hand, the time for internalisation has a negative effect on business performance, meaning that the later the SMEs internationalise, the better their performance. Qualitative findings indicate that good networks with competitors, suppliers and government will help a firm to serve the international market successfully. From theoretical perspectives, the findings support the Resource‐Based View theory as international business skills have positive relationships with two dimensions of internationalisation. The findings of this study also support the traditional view of incremental internationalisation advanced by Stage Theory. Consequently, the findings imply that International New Venture Theory, which supports born‐global or leap‐frog approach in internationalising SMEs, is not appropriate for Indonesian context. Finally, this study also supports the Network Perspective which suggests that the relationships built by firms with other businesses, community leaders, and government have significant effect on <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs.</b> Overall, this study demonstrates the unique effect of different organisational capitals (i. e. human and social) as key resources for facilitating internationalisation...|$|E

The findings of this research suggest that Russian SMEs follow different existing theories of internationalisation.

40|$|The {{internationalisation}} literature {{tends to}} rely on large multinational enterprises as the traditional unit of analysis, {{despite the fact that}} SMEs are active in international markets.

Therefore, the purpose of this thesis was to investigate how the <b>internationalisation</b> process <b>of</b> Swedish <b>SMEs</b> when entering the German market can be characterised. The research was conducted by personal interviews in two case-study firms in the engineering industry.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{influence}} of national institutional environments on the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SME</b> exporters from two countries, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, which followed divergent paths in the transition process. It contributes in several ways, notably by extending scholarly debate on divergent paths of transition to the IB literature, and enriching the institution-based view of IB with perspectives from the new institutional economics and comparative institutionalism and offering fresh evidence of how formal and informal institutions and the enforcement mechanism interact to create specific incentives and barriers for internationalising SMEs. The study, {{one of the first}} to examine SME exporters from the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, cautions against the tendency to attribute countries in the transitional periphery with homogenous institutional environments. Analysis of case study evidence suggests appreciable differences in the institutional environments facing SME exporters in the comparator countries. More specifically, SME exporters in Tajikistan seem to experience tougher institutional constraints relative to their Kyrgyzstan counterparts, and this divergence in institutional environments appears to affect the internationalisation prospects and competitiveness of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan SME exporters adversely and favourably respectively. The above findings are richly illustrated in the paper, which also discusses implications for theory, managerial and policy decision making and future research...|$|R
40|$|The {{arts and}} crafts sector in Zimbabwe belongs {{to a number of}} {{industries}} that are collectively combined and defined as cultural industries. Despite being diversified, {{little is known about the}} contribution of the cultural heritage sector to national economic growth. The contribution of cultural products to national trade is less than one percent of the value of total exports of all products. This dissertation focuses on identifying the exporting barriers that hinder the internationalisation of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the {{arts and crafts}} industry in order to draw conclusions that can be used to enable the sector to realise its full potential. The data was collected from a survey of 58 SMEs in the arts and crafts sector that were selected using random sampling. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect the data from the sample. Follow-up interviews were conducted to clarify some of the responses. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics methods such as bar graphs, pie charts and the arithmetic mean. The results revealed that the most common barriers hindering the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> include lack of financial resources to finance exports, high transportation costs, high cost of capital to finance export, poor economic situation in foreign markets and lack of incentives from the home government. Findings also indicated that export support services offered by the Zimbabwean government are not adequate in assisting the export development of SMEs in the arts and crafts sector. The research concludes that exporting is not trouble free but is affected by several barriers that vary in their severity and significance. Managers/owners of SMEs and relevant government institutions need to be fully prepared in order to tackle and minimise the exporting barriers that hinder the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs.</b> Organisations such as Small Enterprises Development Cooperation (SEDCO) and financial institutions need to provide funding to SMEs so that they can develop their exporting capacity. The government should improve the provision of export support services and increase the awareness of such services where they are available...|$|E

The paper aims to identify the motives, capabilities and model <b>of</b> the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> MNC’s and <b>SME’s</b> from India. A comparative analysis is thereby used to address the differences and similarities between the <b>internationalisation</b> process <b>of</b> these MNC’s and SME’s. Although the research content on the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> the MNC’s and the SME’s is increasing lately, but there is hardly any research that involves the comparisons <b>of</b> <b>internationalisation</b> process <b>of</b> the MNC’s and SME’s. The firms chosen for study are two major MNC’s and two Born Global SME’s operating from India. The previous theories and literatures are used for relating with the actual <b>internationalisation</b> process <b>of</b> these firms considered. The finding illustrates the {{significant differences in the}} motives and capabilities involved in the internationalisation between the SME’s and MNC’s. The MNC’s were observed to have strong motives in order to seek potential market, resources and strategic assets and had strong firm specific advantages during internationalisation.

An observed phenomenon is the increased momentum of <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> in the developed world (Lu & Beamish, 2001). A concern however is the small percentage of the SMEs from developing countries emulating this trend. Also remain unexplained are: (1) What makes a small percentage of SMEs in developing countries to succeed in internationalising their businesses when the large majority fail? (2) What provides the differential advantage to the growth businesses? Therefore, this paper attempts to address the research question “What impact the owner-managers perceptions of internal and external barriers have on the internationalisation process of the SMEs in a developing country?” The data was gathered from owner-managers of SMEs using a mail survey. Export growth was used as the dependent variable in the study. The differential performance of “growth” and “non-growth” SMEs in foreign markets is elucidated in relation to the owner-managers perception of informational, operational, marketing and environmental barriers to growth.

Relevant literature is surveyed and a conceptual model on internationalisation is developed.

Four different regions were included in a quasi-experimental design, each including their population of SMEs in the mechanical and wood product sector. The empirical part of the paper is mostly descriptive and includes analyses of the structural differences between the SME populations in the four regions and a report on their involvement in subcontracting, interfirm relations, and their use of producer services.

40|$|Research on the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) has received increasing attention in recent years due to the important role they play in today’s economic environment. Internationalisation prompting, or awareness, is an already recognised phase of the innovation-related stages model (I-model). This phase of awareness is closely related to the international exposure that a firm may experience during the occasion when it realises its competitors are already internationalising. Although the literature has discussed the various forms in which international exposure may happen, there has been limited attention given to the extent of its effect on the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> clustered <b>SMEs</b> that behave according to the I-Model. This study will assess the applicability of the I-Model in a dynamic, competitive and co-operative setting of an industrial cluster. It also evaluates the impact (if any) of international exposure derived from networks and the mimetic pressure that these firms may experience due to their embeddedness in an industrial cluster. Results from this study will indicate the effectiveness of the improved adapted model that will provide a richer insight for both academic researchers and policy makers...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} the importance of ethnic workforce diversity for the internationalisation of small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Using the resource-based view, it is argued that an ethnically diverse workforce can help SMEs in overcoming barriers to internationalisation and increase the degree to which they benefit from globalisation. Design/methodology/approach – This is a conceptual paper using the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm to investigate the importance of work force diversity. Findings – The paper identifies a series of mechanisms that link ethnic workforce diversity to increased <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> as well as a range of contingencies of this relationship. It calls for a stronger appreciation of individual employees' external, co-ethnic networks and knowledge as a hitherto largely ignored resource in the initiation, management and expansion of SMEs' international operations. Research limitations/implications – The findings of the paper have implications for research and practice by shedding light on the importance of this so far largely neglected phenomenon. The findings are limited in as far as they are yet to be tested empirically. Practical implications – The paper provides a framework of mechanisms that can sensitise practitioners with regard to the importance of workforce diversity for internationalisation activities as well as human resource management practices. Originality/value – The paper addresses an issue that is shown to be of increasing importance to SMEs, but has so far been largely neglected in research on SMEs...|$|E
40|$|Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) {{have played}} an {{important}} role both in developed and developing economies. The research on internationalisation has mainly focused on large companies, especially Multinational Companies (MNCs) and only limited studies have been conducted in <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> in developing countries. In recent years, the Indonesian government has acknowledged SMEs as a key source of domestic income growth and employment creation. While SMEs have been recognised as a source of domestic income through export activity, Indonesian SMEs only play a small role compared to Large Enterprises (LEs). Indonesian SME exporters represent only 21 % of non-oil and gas exports. Policies and programs to assist SMEs to internationalise must be guided by clear understanding of the dynamic nature of SMEs. This paper proposes factors that may influence Indonesian SMEs to internationalise, namely, entrepreneur human and social capital. The study will use qualitative as well as quantitative data analysis. The sample will be drawn from owner-manager manufacturing SMEs (independent, with fewer than 100 employees, and managed by owners) from selected provinces in Indonesia based on a governmental database. It will cover industries such as the garment, furniture, handicraft, leather products and footwear industries. NVivo will be used to analyse the qualitative data while statistical software will be utilised to analyse the quantitative data. This paper argues that financial assistance will be useless for SMEs without an entrepreneurial spirit. SME internationalisation, developing countries, exporting SMEs...|$|E
40|$|Purpose We study {{particular}} {{structural and}} organisational factors affecting the formality of {{human resource management}} (HRM) practices in {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) in South-Eastern European (SEE) post-communist countries, in particular Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) {{in order to understand the}} antecedents of formalization in such settings. Design/methodology/approach Adopting a quantitative approach, this study analyses data gathered through a survey of 168 managers of SMEs from throughout the region. Findings The results show that HRM in SMEs in the SEE region can be understood through a three-fold framework which includes: degree of <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs,</b> sector of SMEs and organisational size of SMEs. These three factors positively affect the level of HRM formalisation in SEE SMEs. These findings are further attributed to the particular political and economic context of the post-communist SEE region. Research limitations/implications Although specific criteria were set for SME selection, we do not suggest that the study reflects a representative picture of the SEE region because we used a purposive sampling methodology. Practical implications This article provides useful insights into the factors which influence HRM in SMEs in a particular context. The findings can help business owners and managers understand how HRM can be applied in smaller organisations, particularly in post-communist SEE business contexts. Originality/value HRM in SMEs in this region has hardly been studied at all despite their importance. Therefore, this exploratory research seeks to expand knowledge relating to the application of HRM in SMEs in SEE countries which have their business environments dominated by different dynamics in comparison to western European ones...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) from an emerging market to a developed market. In particular, it examines the <b>internationalisation</b> process <b>of</b> a firm in the clothing and textile manufacturing industry in Ghana. Theoretically, the study is limited to the network internationalisation approach (e. g. Johanson & Mattsson, 1988; Johanson & Vahlne, 2009) and the industrial network approach (Håkansson & Snehota, 1995). Methodologically, a qualitative abductive case study approach is employed. The research process relies on a longitudinal method involving primary and secondary data and critical event analysis. Primary data has been collected from relevant informants at two different times in the internationalisation process. The research findings highlight the significance of both domestic and foreign business relationships in the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> an <b>SME</b> from an emerging African market to a developed country market. They show the greater importance of exogenous critical events than has been found in the research regarding firms in developed countries. Institutional actors were essential in the network and as sources of exogenous critical events. In addition, the successful SME should possess unique resources {{in the form of an}} entrepreneurial spirit, sufficient knowledge <b>of</b> <b>internationalisation,</b> and specific product knowledge. Theoretically, the present study contributes to business network research through providing an understanding of the process of developing network relationships and their impact in an African context. By focusing on SMEs, a contribution has been made in relation to the advancement <b>of</b> <b>SME</b> research. This research reveals empirical insight into SME internationalisation in a setting where an SME is internationalising to a developed country market from a newly emerging African market. Methodologically, the study provides an example of longitudinal research based on abductive methodology. The results provide implications for firms, managers, and policy-makers within the industry, especially on how to manage and use network relationships to promote SME internationalisation from newly emerging markets...|$|R
40|$|Development tendencies {{for small}} and {{medium-sized}} enterprises are difficult to predict because of their number and heterogeneity. Analysing the possible direction of changes implies the observation of economic indicators, preferable forms of financing and the processes taking place in enterprises’ environment. Despite domination of traditional way of financing it is clear that alternative way of obtaining funds (business angels, venture capital) are getting more popular. Globalisation influenced <b>internationalisation</b> and innovation <b>of</b> <b>SMEs.</b> Internet plays crucial role in business transactions. During last years small and medium sized enterprises experienced steady development.

40|$|The {{need for}} this {{research}} stemmed {{from the fact that}} most of what we know about the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> small and medium enterprises (SMEs) emerges from developed countries; little is known about <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> African <b>SMEs</b> or, in particular, South African <b>SMEs.</b> The impact <b>of</b> globalisation, trade liberalisation, and technology advancement on SMEs is that they face increased competition right on their doorstep. To remain in existence and sustain their growth, SMEs are concertedly seeking opportunities in foreign markets. In order for SMEs to succeed and exploit international opportunities, they develop and rely on networks to compensate for their liability of foreignness, as well as their lack of resources in terms of finance, marketing, human capital, reputation, and technology. This research investigated the effect of resource acquisition networks on the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>of</b> small and medium enterprises. The study involved SMEs who had internationalised their operations. Data were collected through unstructured interviews in Phase One and semistructured interviews in Phase Two of this research study, with SME owners and their managers who were responsible for international operations. The key focus was the three research propositions dealing with networks, which focused on three network characteristics: network diversity, network density, and network size. The findings show that the South African SME internationalisation process is highly influenced by resource acquisition networks. SMEs use their networks to exploit international opportunities by accessing resources that they lack internally. A highly diversified and highly connected network is significant to the SMEs’ opportunity identification of and access to resources, while the size of the network is quite important.
