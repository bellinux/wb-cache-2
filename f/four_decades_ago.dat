Industrial facilities in Tabriz and Arak are Iran's largest producers of machinery and equipment for the agricultural sector. 12,000 combine harvesters and 300,000 tractors are currently used in the sector (2007). Tabriz Tractor Manufacturing Company, which was founded <b>four</b> <b>decades</b> <b>ago,</b> employs almost 10,000 people. It produces 30,000 tractors annually, {{a large part of}} which is exported. Iran declared self-sufficiency in irrigation and agricultural machinery in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1940s, pumping {{from the}} Ogallala has drawn the aquifer {{down more than}} [...] in some areas. Producers have taken steps to reduce their {{reliance}} on irrigated water. Streamlined operations allow them to produce significantly greater yield using roughly {{the same amount of}} water needed <b>four</b> <b>decades</b> <b>ago.</b> Still, losses to the aquifer between 2001 and 2011 equated to a third of its cumulative depletion during the entire 20th century. The Ogallala is recharged primarily by rainwater, but only about one inch of precipitation actually reaches the aquifer annually. Rainfall in most of the Texas High Plains is minimal, evaporation is high, and infiltration rates are slow.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSince its {{introduction}} a <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> DDDAS {{has been applied}} {{to a wide range of}} science and technology fields, with specific focus of areas requiring fast and reliable processing of massive data streams from diverse resources. It is crucial to explore architectures and systems which are naturally suited to the DDDAS framework. In this paper, we show that the memristor – the fourth fundamental two-terminal passive circuit element alongside the well-known resistor, capacitor, and inductor – a_ords the e_cient implementation of the working principles of DDDAS. Hence memristors can be considered as an archetype of DDDAS nanoscale hardware embodiment, being the smallest and most basic dynamic data driven application system. Memristors are electrical components with inherent memory processes; they have been predicted about <b>four</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago</b> and have been physically implemented recently. We discuss the role that DDDAS may play in the development of computing platforms and sensor networks based on memristors in the next few years...|$|R

Another study attributed significant differences in fault behavior to the maturity of the fault. These kinds of complexities are not reflected in current prediction methods.|$|E

40|$|Early {{attempts}} were made <b>four</b> and five <b>decades</b> <b>ago</b> to measure electron-stimulated electron emissions of insulators. These studies were subject to errors associated with poor vacuum system contamination, inadequate material surface control, and crude detection setups. Electron yields of insulators are difficult to measure since incident electron sources will impart surface and bulk charges that cannot easily be dissipated, that in turn affect electron emissions. By using short-duration, low-current electron pulses, these charging effects can be minimized. Additionally, the insulator can be neutralized periodically to return the surface to its original uncharged state. At Utah State University, we have improved upon previous insulator measurements using ultra-high vacuum technology, a fully-enclosed hemispherical detection system, pulsed electron sources, compact low energy electron neutralization sources, and fast-response low-noise picoammeters. Data will be presented on insulator surface potential evolution {{as a function of}} electron fluence, as well as neutralized-insulator electron yields...|$|R
40|$|Radical criminology, observes Stanley Cohen, is {{predicated}} on an unmistakable paradox or irony: it brought about {{not the end of}} academic institutionalized criminology, but rather its emphatic rejuvenation. To acknowledge this is to recognize that it has inspired a number of studies profoundly deeper in significance and incomparably wider in scope than anything attempted by criminologists <b>four</b> or five <b>decades</b> <b>ago</b> (a point made luminously explicit in Jock Young's chapter in this volume: esp., at pp. 259 – 260); that it has redefined the subject matter of criminology, placing social control at its very centre; and that it has convinced even the most intransigently ‘correctionalist’ of criminologists that, in Roger Hood's words, ‘criminal behaviour as a social entity does not exist independently of the apparatus which defines it, which classifies it, labels it and interacts with it’ (Hood, 1987, p. 530). Radical criminology, for all its brazen iconoclasm, has achieved a secure, perhaps even a canonical, status as a central theoretical force in contemporary criminology...|$|R

Based on archival data for the last <b>four</b> <b>decades</b> of motion picture production, my findings suggest that the industry has adapted its existing routines to integrate innovative visual effects technology into a variant of the traditional form of project organization. I find further evidence that some new routines have become dominant, while others have failed to survive the selection process. ...|$|R
