5|$|Belgian comics artist Willy Vandersteen {{created his}} own version of the TV show with a collie named Bessy in 1954. Apart from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> comic strip starred the same dog breed with a similar name it {{had little to do with}} the series overall, since the comic was a western comic.|$|E
5|$|Bianchi's {{exposure}} to motorsport started at around 3 {{years of age}} through karting and was facilitated by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father owned a kart track. Since age 17, Bianchi was professionally managed by Nicolas Todt.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{yet another}} brother, {{possibly}} younger than Nyuserre {{has also been}} proposed: Iryenre, a prince Iry-pat whose relationship {{is suggested by the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> funerary cult was associated with that of his mother, both having taken place in the temple of Khentkaus II.|$|E
50|$|Ulrich III {{was born}} around 1310, as {{the eldest son}} of Ulrich II of Hanau and his wife, Agnes of Hohenlohe-Weikersheim.

5|$|With {{the arrival}} of the year 2012, Nostradamus's prophecies started to be co-opted (especially by the History Channel) as {{evidence}} suggesting {{that the end of the}} world was imminent, notwithstanding the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> book never mentions the end of the world, let alone the year 2012.|$|E
5|$|As word {{increased}} of Bayh's intentions, {{political scientists}} opined on the detractions of a run. Citing the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{eight years as}} governor may be nullified by its distance in time and that his visibility in the Senate was low, critics pondered whether moderate voters may {{be more inclined to}} line with possible candidate Mark Warner of Virginia. However, this criticism subsided once Warner decided against a run in October 2006.|$|E
50|$|Falstaff here is {{lamenting the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> because <b>his</b> name is so terrifying, enemies avoid {{fighting}} him. This is obviously bomphiologia on Falstaff's part.|$|R

5|$|Corzine {{campaigned for}} state {{government}} programs including universal health care, universal gun registration, mandatory public preschool, and more taxpayer funding for college education. He pushed {{affirmative action and}} same-sex marriage. David Brooks opined that Corzine was so liberal that his election, although the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> predecessor was also a Democrat, helped push the Senate to the left.|$|E
5|$|Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941– August 28, 1955) was a 14-year-old African-American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after a {{white woman}} said she was {{offended}} by him in her family's grocery store. The brutality of his murder and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> killers were acquitted {{drew attention to the}} long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
50|$|Also {{unusual is}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Sullivan {{includes}} <b>his</b> {{name in the}} tile mosaic over the front door.|$|R

At around the same time he was called up to represent Northern Ireland at under-18 level, qualifying by virtue of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> maternal grandfather {{was born in}} the country.|$|E
5|$|Quentin Tarantino as Himself (Extended version): In a short {{appearance}} with Kermit the Frog, Tarantino discusses violent {{ideas on}} how to stop the Wicked Witch of the West.

5|$|Six of {{the dead}} were not wearing seat belts, while a seventh was not {{properly}} restrained. Greg Sypher, a collision analyst and principal Transport Canada investigator, later suggested that seat belts most likely would not have saved all the victims' lives. Randy Arseneau credits the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> son, Bradd Arseneau, was not wearing his seatbelt for Bradd's survival, saying that if Bradd had not been thrown to the floor just before the collision he may also have died.|$|E
25|$|Kim was {{tortured}} {{and sentenced to}} death. According to 'Baekbeom Ilji', however, many Korean people were sympathetic and admired him for his patriotism and bravery, {{as shown by the}} <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> execution was suspended by order of Emperor Gwangmu, that Korean judicial officials behaved politely to him despite Japanese pressure to execute him promptly, and that influential Koreans at the time (including major merchants of Incheon) made efforts to rescue him by repeated petitions to Korean Justice Department Officials and by collecting money for his ransom before his scheduled execution date.|$|R

5000|$|Pediatrician Philip LaRussa {{wrote that}} [...] "Wakefield’s film acts {{as if his}} {{research}} had not been revealed as fraudulent": Wakefield didn’t mention the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he lost <b>his</b> license in Great Britain, he didn’t mention the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> 11 of <b>his</b> co-authors withdrew their names from his paper. He didn’t mention the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> there {{was a series of}} investigative articles by journalist Brian Deer. None of that existed in this film. Vaxxed: an expert view on controversial film about vaccines and autism.|$|R
5|$|Some sources {{assert that}} Mickiewicz's mother was descended from a converted, Frankist Jewish family. Others {{view this as}} improbable. Polish {{historian}} Kazimierz Wyka, in his biographic entry in Polski Słownik Biograficzny (1975) writes that this hypothesis, based on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> mother's maiden name, Majewska, was popular among Frankist Jews, has not been proven. Wyka states that poet's mother {{was the daughter of}} a noble (szlachta) family of Starykoń coat of arms, living on an estate at Czombrów in Nowogródek Voivodeship (Navahrudak Voivodeship).|$|E
5|$|United Abominations was {{recorded}} in 2006 at SARM Hook End Studios, London, England; the Steakhouse, Studio City, California; Big Fish Encinitas, California and Backstage Productions. Additional overdubs were recorded at S.I.R. rehearsal studio, Hollywood, California and Mustaine Music, Fallbrook, California. Most of the record was tracked in England because Mustaine admired the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> favorite band, Led Zeppelin, previously recorded there many times. Mustaine produced the album, with additional production handled by Jeff Balding and Andy Sneap.|$|E
5|$|According to Taylor, Russell {{discounted}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{career was}} facilitated by white {{people who were}} proven anti-racists, namely his white high school coach George Powles (the person who encouraged him to play basketball), his white college coach Phil Woolpert (who integrated USF basketball), white Celtics coach Red Auerbach (who is regarded as an anti-racist pioneer and made him the first black NBA coach), and white Celtics owner Walter A. Brown, who gave him a high $24,000 rookie contract, just $1,000 shy of the top earning veteran Bob Cousy.|$|E
5000|$|David Morrissey as General Tobias Shepherd, Head of the Global Security Commission. Shepherd has a {{personal}} history with Molly Woods, a <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> complicates <b>his</b> work (and his life) {{in the face of}} a deadly new threat to humanity.|$|R
2500|$|Miller {{was elected}} Governor of Delaware in 1912 by {{defeating}} Thomas M.

50|$|The {{significance}} {{of the name of}} Jesus in the New Testament is underscored by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> in <b>his</b> Nativity account Matthew pays more attention to the name of the child and its theological implications than the actual birth event itself.|$|R
5|$|Although Tacitus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are complicated by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor. In his biographical work Agricola, Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{decides to}} motivate and inspire {{everyone}} by taking {{them on a}} field trip to Gettysburg. At Gettysburg, Andy is unhappy with the lack of morale and belief in his leadership and attempts to make an analogy between running a paper company and fighting in the Civil War. Andy starts to lead a haphazard tour, and eventually most of the office members sit down to rest. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) follow Andy after he presses on, and eventually tell him to stop trying to impress the office. They reinforce the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> co-workers like him the way he is.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Colorado, McDonald {{found himself}} at the centre of another power struggle. Sympathetic to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> wife was {{less than two weeks}} away from giving birth, head coach Don Cherry gave McDonald {{permission}} to leave the team on off-days to return to his wife in Toronto. But he did so without gaining the approval of general manager Ray Miron, who disagreed frequently with Cherry and fired him following the season. On the ice, McDonald scored 35goals with the Rockies and finished with a total of 40 between the two teams.|$|E

50|$|The few {{verses of}} <b>his</b> <b>that</b> survive {{seem to be}} {{dedicated}} to pastoral country life and viniculture, and it is supposed that these are overall reflective of his body of work, owing to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> in <b>his</b> short description, Aulus Gellius depicts Annianus as harvesting grapes.|$|R
60|$|Bully the English Sparrow is a born fighter. He {{never is}} happier {{than when he}} {{is in the midst of}} a fight or a fuss of some kind. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> all <b>his</b> neighbors were against him didn't bother Bully in the least.|$|R
