500|$|Although Pasteur {{had little}} idea how his method worked, he tested it on a boy, Joseph Meister (1876–1940), who {{was brought to}} Pasteur by his mother on 6 July 1885. He was covered in bites, having been set upon by a mad dog. [...] Meister's mother begged Pasteur to help her son. Pasteur was a scientist, not a physician, and he {{was well aware of}} the {{consequences}} for him if things were to go wrong. He nevertheless decided to help the boy and injected him with increasingly virulent rabid rabbit spinal tissue over the following 10days. Later Pasteur wrote, [...] "as the death of this child appeared inevitable, <b>I</b> <b>decided,</b> <b>not</b> without deep and severe unease... to try out on Joseph Meister the procedure, which had consistently worked on dogs". [...] Meister recovered and returned home with his mother on 27 July. Pasteur successfully treated a second boy in October that same year; Jean-Baptiste Jupille (1869–1923) was a 15-year-old shepherd boy who had been severely bitten as he tried to protect other children from a rabid dog. Pasteur's method of treatment [...] remained in use for over 50years.|$|E
500|$|In May2007, Usher {{split with}} Patton as his manager. This {{prompted}} [...] "gossip" [...] that Usher had [...] "fired" [...] {{her because of}} his growing relationship with Foster. He denied the claims, saying, [...] "I love my mother ... <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to fire, not get rid of, but to give [...] the ultimate complimentto retire {{her to be a}} full-time grandmother." [...] He continued by stating that the split was a mutual decision. It was speculated that Patton's dismissal was due to his engagement with Foster; Usher dismissed these claims on Total Request Live (TRL) in May2008. In what MTV News' Shawn Adler called an [...] "angry tirade", Usher stated, [...] "My wife {{had nothing to do with}} me firing my mother — nothing like that, that's trash. I hear y'all talking crazy out there. She's a beautiful black woman. Stop. Stop talking. And I love her. Stop it." [...] The outbreak was compared to Mariah Carey's unannounced 2001 appearance on TRL, when she handed out popsicles to the show's audience and performed a [...] "striptease", while some fans noted Usher's speech as evidence that Foster was being controlling of Usher. Usher hired Benny Medina as his new manager; Medina said of Usher, [...] "The thing that excited me most is the intense commitment to his art, his incredible professionalism and the fact that I feel as though he's just hitting a stride." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fulci's {{version is}} as follows: [...] "One day I told Dardano {{the plot of}} my Evil Comes Back (later retitled Per Sempre/Until Death), a sequel on a fantastic note to The Postman Always Rings Twice, and he {{proposed}} it to several producers with {{my name on it}} as the director. Then, one day, he registered the screenplay with his name on it! (laughs) I later found out that he'd sold the story idea to a producer (Sergio Martino), but, in view of our past friendship, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to sue him. I just broke off all relations with him. He is indeed a very good scriptwriter though." ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{came to the}} {{realisation}} that as she and {{her fans}} were growing up, {{it was time for}} her {{to move away from the}} teen appeal to wider audiences, and en-cash on the longevity of the album market. Feeling the need to attempt something different, Madonna wanted the sound of her new album to indicate what could be popular in the music world. For lyrical ideas of the title track, she chose topics that until then had been personal meditations never to be shared with the general public; she told SongTalk magazine [...] "In the past I wrote a lot of songs that , but I felt they were too honest or too frightening or too scary and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to record them". She decided to take a more adult, sophisticated approach; thoughtfully, she sifted through her personal journals and diaries, and began considering her options. She recalled, [...] "What was it I wanted to say? I wanted the album and the song to speak to things on my mind. It was a complex time in my life." [...] She had certain matters on her mind, including her troubled relationship with her husband, actor Sean Penn, her family, her lost mother and even her belief in God.|$|E
60|$|It {{struck me}} there was sense in what he said. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to mention my idea of carving 1553 above the front-door.|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding this warning, Euphemia and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> {{to take in}} our sign. We {{were not}} to be frightened by a stage-driver. The next day our own driver passed us on the road as he was going down.|$|E

Now, {{with a couple of}} trips to the Hunger Games under my belt, <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> <b>not</b> to judge him without knowing more details. Maybe his lover was already sentenced to death and he was trying to make it easier. To let her know he'd be waiting. Or maybe he thought the place he was leaving her was really worse than death..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, curse you {{and your}} oats!" [...] growled Jo, with {{simulated}} anger. [...] "You make such a fuss about a bargain, <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to trade. Take your old donkeys, and call it square!" ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{reason in}} what he was saying. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to mention my idea of {{altering}} the chimneys and fixing up imitation gables, especially as young Bute seemed pleased with the house, which by this time we had reached.|$|E
60|$|We {{thought we}} would give up {{gambling}} then. As Harris said, it breeds an unhealthy excitement when carried too far. George offered {{to go on and}} give us our revenge; but Harris and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to battle any further against Fate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go and see {{my little}} {{daughter}} before you leave Florence. She's alone at the villa; <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to send her to my sister, who hasn't at all my ideas. Tell her she must love her poor father very much," [...] said Gilbert Osmond gently.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--that {{was what}} I was afraid of! But <b>I</b> had <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> {{to write to}} you any more. They won't have me back at the school--that's why I couldn't write. Not the fact, but the reason!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011, owner Dumitru Bucşaru did not file for a licence for the club {{to play in the}} Liga <b>I</b> and <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to enroll the team in any championship. Unirea Urziceni was {{subsequently}} dissolved.|$|R
6000|$|... "The first I {{knew that}} babies were disgraceful. Why, Sarah, you, with your five, how disgraceful you have been. Billy and <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to be half as disgraceful. We're {{only going to}} have two--a boy and a girl." ...|$|R
60|$|I should, in the {{ordinary}} course of business, have addressed Mr. Parable by name, such being our instructions {{in the case of}} customers known to us. But, putting the hat and the girl together, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to. Mr. Parable was all for our three-and-six-penny table d'hote; he evidently not wanting to think. But the lady wouldn't hear of it.|$|E
60|$|We washed {{ourselves}} in the Rhine at Cologne (we {{had not had a}} wash since we had left our happy home in England). We started with the idea of washing ourselves at the hotel; but on seeing the basin and water and towel provided, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to waste my time playing with them. As well might Hercules have attempted to tidy up the Augean stables with a squirt.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I came second-cabin," [...] said Jeff. [...] "I {{worked my}} way over on a cattle-ship to London, and, when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to work my way back, I found I hadn't enough money for a first-cabin passage. I {{was in a hurry}} to get back in time to get settled at Harvard, and so I came second-cabin. It wasn't bad. I used to see you across the rail." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the same}} subject, he also {{emphasised}} the Greek hero's individualism (opposite to the Eastern {{dissolution of the}} self inside the Great Universe) {{even to the point}} of choosing his own death. In Gemma, he writes poetically: [...] "I will die, Death, when I want and not when you want. In this last act, your desire is not going to be realised, it is my desire which will be realised. I fight against your will. I fight your power. I fight all of your entity. I will enter into the earth when <b>I</b> <b>decide,</b> <b>not</b> when you decide." [...] 1997.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>decided.</b> <b>I</b> knew <b>not</b> {{where my}} sister might be searching, {{or if she}} might not be {{likewise}} a prisoner; so I directed him first {{to the house of}} M. Darpent, who was more likely {{to know what to do}} than Sir Francis Ommaney. Besides, the Rue des Marmousets, where stood Maison Darpent, was not far off.|$|R
50|$|In 1948, she {{approached}} Mary Gilmore {{to write a}} forward to Travels in North Queensland, but Gilmore declined {{on the basis that}} Devanny should write it herself, as 'I have written so many that <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to write any more for a time, as they will have no value by now'.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have an {{engagement}} {{in a few}} minutes," [...] he explained. [...] "My car is waiting now. I looked in at the club to dine, found my favourite table taken and nearly every man I ever disliked sidling up {{to tell me that}} he hears I am giving a wonderful party on Thursday. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to dine there, after all, and Charles found me a corner here. I am going in five minutes." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{offered to}} go with him, and that offer he accepted, whereafter I lounged in his {{antechamber}} waiting until he should be dressed, and considering whether to impart to him the further information I had that morning gleaned. In the end <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to do so, unable to bring myself {{to tell him that}} so much turpitude might possibly be plotting against Bianca. It was a statement that soiled her, so it seemed to me. Indeed I could scarcely bear to think of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Three francs--two kilometers--and {{three pieces}} of luggage! No signore. No! Five francs. Cinque franchi!" [...] And averting his pallid, old mudlarking face, and flinging his hand out at me, he stood the image of indignant repudiation. And truly, he was no taller than my upper {{waistcoat}} pocket. The brat! The brat! He was such an actor, and so impudent, that I wavered between wonder and amusement and a great inclination to kick him up the steps. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to waste my energy being angry.|$|E
5000|$|Commenting on her work, Grobéty explained: [...] "I don't have {{a fashionable}} style. A {{long time ago}} <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to work <b>not</b> on the busy high streets but in the back yards." ...|$|R
30|$|True but harmful {{since they}} {{activate}} (affective or automatic) reactions hindering or counterproductive for me; for example, they trigger panic and this creates obstacles {{for a more}} successful behavior. Or I know of a plane crash and <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> do <b>not</b> take my fly. Or harmful since to posses that Inf expose me to be tortured to extort it or to be killed.|$|R
5|$|Last year <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> I'm <b>not</b> doing music until I'm excited again, {{then this}} {{came along and}} also I did end up making another record which I'll release at some point. It's just being mastered, it's a lovely album; I didn't write this one, this is old songs and I have to sort out my situation- I don't want the same problem as before.|$|R
60|$|Curiously enough I have {{completely}} forgotten my mood after {{that for a}} little while, but I know that later, for a minute perhaps, I hung for a time out of the carriage with the door open, contemplating a leap from the train. It {{was to be a}} dramatic leap, and then I would go storming back to her, denounce her, overwhelm her; and I hung, urging myself to do it. I don't remember how it was <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to do this, at last, but in the end I didn't.|$|E
6000|$|... "I never {{published}} it," [...] {{explained the}} Minor Poet. [...] "Within {{the same week}} two friends of mine, one of whom {{had just returned from}} Norway and the other from Switzerland, confided to me their intention of writing stories about girls who had fallen into glaciers, and who had been found by their friends long afterwards, looking as good as new; and a few days later I chanced upon a book, the heroine of which had been dug out of a glacier alive three hundred years after she had fallen in. There seemed to be a run on ice maidens, and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to add to their number." ...|$|E
60|$|Her eyes quite {{shone with}} pleasure. I turned away, finding the {{conversation}} silly. I thought I would {{do without the}} pleasant looks of Madonna Giulia, and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> {{to come to her}} again. Meanwhile, I began talking to one of the other ladies in the room and passed the time agreeably enough.... In a little while Giulia passed me, leaning on the arm of one of her admirers. I saw her glance at me, but I took no notice. Immediately afterwards she came again, hesitating a moment, as if she wished to say something, but passed on without speaking. I thought she was piqued at my inattention to her, and, with a smile, redoubled my attentions to the lady with whom I was talking.|$|E
60|$|I {{was soon}} on the road, {{nibbling}} a cake of chocolate and seriously occupied {{with a case}} of conscience. Was I to pay for my night's lodging? I had slept ill, the bed was full of fleas {{in the shape of}} ants, there was no water in the room, the very dawn had neglected to call me in the morning. I might have missed a train, had there been any in the neighbourhood to catch. Clearly, I was dissatisfied with my entertainment; and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> should <b>not</b> pay unless I met a beggar.|$|R
2500|$|Later than month, the Collingdale GOP {{followed}} {{the lead of}} Glenolden, Darby, Prospect Park and Tinicum, in dumping Milliken as its representative on the War Board. There was some measure of suspense as Milliken pondered another race, this time as an independent, but on February 18, he issued a terse statement: [...] "After consideration, <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> to {{be a candidate for}} reelection to the U.S. Congress." ...|$|R
