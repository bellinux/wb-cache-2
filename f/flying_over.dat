5|$|Foster's {{flair for}} musical melodrama inspires Madonna {{to turn in}} what is easily her most assured and {{full-bodied}} vocal performance to date. Amid a swirl of strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> the heads of her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' of this generation.|$|E

5|$|The A-10's {{durability}} {{was shown}} on 7 April 2003 when Captain Kim Campbell, while <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> Baghdad during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, suffered extensive flak damage. Iraqi fire damaged {{one of her}} engines and crippled the hydraulic system, requiring the aircraft's stabilizer and flight controls to be operated via the 'manual reversion mode'. Despite this damage, Campbell flew the aircraft {{for nearly an hour}} and landed safely.|$|E
5|$|The Oseberg {{tapestry}} fragments, discovered {{within the}} Viking Age Oseberg ship burial in Norway, feature a scene containing two black birds hovering over a horse, possibly originally leading a wagon (as {{a part of}} a procession of horse-led wagons on the tapestry).
