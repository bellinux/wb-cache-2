40|$|Beach erosion {{is likely}} to accelerate, driven by {{predicted}} consequences of climate change and coastal development. Erosion is increasingly combated by beach nourishment, adding sand to eroding shores. Because a range of engineering techniques exists to nourish beaches, and because these techniques differ in their environmental effects, assessments of ecological impacts need to be tailored and specific. Here we report on impacts and recovery of benthic invertebrates impacted by beach nourishment operations undertaken at Palm Beach (SE Queensland, Australia). Assessments are made based on a beyond-BACI design, where samples were taken once before nourishment and twice afterwards at the impact and two control sites. Because {{almost all of the}} sand was deposited on the upper beach and later moved with bulldozers down-shore, we specifically examined whether the effects of nourishment varied at different heights of the beach—a little-studied question which has management implications. Impacts on the fauna were massive on the upper and middle levels of the beach: samples collected two days after the conclusion of nourishment were entirely devoid of all invertebrate life (‘azoic’), whereas weaker effects of nourishment were detectable on the lower shore. Recovery after five months also varied between shore levels. The sediment of the upper level near the dunes remained azoic, the fauna of the middle shore had recovered partially, and the lower level had recovered in most respects. These findings indicate that the height and position of sand placement are important. For example, rather than depositing <b>fill</b> <b>sand</b> on the intertidal beach, it could be placed in the shallow subtidal zone, followed by slow up-shore accretion driven by hydrodynamic forces. Alternatively, techniques that spread the <b>fill</b> <b>sand</b> in thin layers (to minimize mortality by burial) and leave unfilled intertidal refuge islands (to provide colonists) may minimize the ecological impacts of beach nourishment...|$|E
40|$|The Narrabri and Gunnedah Formations, used to {{describe}} the valley-filling sedimentary sequences in portions of the Murray-Darling Basin, have never been formally defined. The hydrogeological evidence for naming these formations is reviewed in the context of modern sedimentary models. Are we using the right architectural model? Hundreds of lithological logs from the Murrumbidgee, Namoi, and Gwydir catchments are used to examine the evolution of each alluvial aquifer. For each depth interval, the catchment-wide proportions of coarse (gravel, sand) and fine (silt, clay) sediments is determined. Sediment size distributions are then examined in the context of past climates and the conceptual inland fluvial model for distributive fluvial systems. Vertical hydraulic connectivity is examined using new hydrogeochemical data and nested groundwater hydrograph sets. All systems show the core features of aggradational distributive fluvial systems. The valley-filling sequences for all catchments examined transitioned from high energy wet environments at depth, dominated by sand and gravel deposits, through to the modern-day low-energy silt and clay dominated depositional environments. Gravel and sand deposits dominate in the proximal portion of the catchment, and low energy silt and clay deposits dominate in the distal portions. The apparent existence of the Narrabri and Gunnedah Formations is due to changing sediment grain size proportion and channel <b>fill</b> <b>sand</b> connectivity. Both the facies and hydrograph analyses show that semi-confining layers are only local. Extensive hydrogeochemical data from the Namoi catchment show continuity of mixing between basement and surface inflows. All catchments have many sedimentary architectural features consistent with the distributive fluvial system model, and reflect changing climate throughout the Neogene and Quaternary. Use of the Narrabri and Gunnedah Formation nomenclature, which has been incorporated into the National Aquifer Framework, is not supported by either the sedimentological, hydrograph or hydrogeochemical record...|$|E
40|$|Coastal Dynamics of Sumber Sari Coast Bali, Indonesia and Implications for Environmental Management By Joe Chambers Advisor: Dr. Brad Murray Executive Summary People {{from around}} the world visit Bali Island, Indonesia for its sandy coastlines, mountainous {{tropical}} forests and distinctive culture. Approximately three million tourists (not including Indonesian nationals) visited Bali in 2013, constituting its primary economic resource (Atmodjo 2013) and affirming its reputation as an international vacation destination. In addition, the ministry of tourism hopes to achieve a 15 % increase in foreign arrivals by 2019, suggesting Bali is unlikely too see any curb in growth in the near future (Rachman 2015). The southern tourist hubs of Bali such as Kuta Beach, Seminyak and Nusa Dua have witnessed rapid growth since the 1970 s. The rapid increase in development coupled with essentially non-existent regulatory framework or coastal zone management plans results in the degradation of the beach environment (Onaka 2012). Lead causes of erosion in the tourist hubs include sediment mining, coral mining and the increased construction of dams. Recent nourishment and shoreline maintenance activities within island tourism hubs highlight the need for revisions to regulatory framework and availability of technical information regarding coastal geomorphology. To receive a building permit within Bali, signatures granting permission are required from government leaders at the village-community level. Community level environmental leaders thus hold the potential to make more sound choices when it comes to developing the their coastline. The interplay between development and shoreline erosion is significant to the Balinese people because to them a beach provides more than economic benefits–it also plays a significant role in cultural and religious activities. Sumber Sari Village located in the Melaya district of Bali exhibits sparse tourism, yielding appeal to outside development. In this project, I assesses the coastal dynamics of Sumber Sari coast by use of historical satellite imagery, beach sediment analyses and field observations to comprehend sediment sources, pathways and sinks—factors that dictate a shoreline’s equilibrium state. A health assessment of the community’s beach shoreline [...] the community's most valuable asset—could enable community leaders to manage this asset sustainably. Given the results, I also address questions put forth by community members and possible investor(s) regarding what they perceive as solutions to an eroding shoreline (specifically the use of groins adjacent to beach properties and the potential of a beach nourishment project). To provide comparative analyses, beach grains from Sumber Sari are compared to non-native <b>fill</b> <b>sand</b> from a resort beach. Information on the non-native <b>fill</b> <b>sand</b> suggests how its introduction to Sumber Sari could affect the geomorphology of the coast. Initial inferences suggest three possibilities for a sediment source: rocky headland, coral reef or coastal stream. Results of my analyses indicate that beach sediments at the Sumber Sari beach originate inland and enter the beach environment via coastal streams, and are then transported northward via alongshore transport, all of which occurs over a relatively short time period. Aerial photographs suggest the coast remains in an equilibrium state—the shore {{does not appear to be}} accreting or eroding at a discernable rate. However, a reduction in sediment load within the coastal stream by way of damming, diversions, increased withdrawals or significant lad use change would likely result in the significant changes to the coast within a relatively short period of time. The construction of groynes adjacent to beachfront properties will create a sand deficit on the north side of the structure, given the northward direction of net alongshore transport. Likewise, a nourishment project utilizing sediment similar to that of the non-native sand sample would create a groin effect due to the differences in grain size and its effects on fall velocity and thus alongshore transport. The short residence time of beach sediments implies a reduction in sediment load to the coast would result in rapid erosion. If community level managers intend to maintain the longevity of their shoreline, it is of utmost importance that the influx of sediment remains unchanged, to avoid the need for ongoing beach nourishment, as occurs on other parts of the island. An expensive large-scale endeavor, nourishment projects are not solution but only treatments for an eroding shoreline. In a developing country such as Indonesia, there exists a serious opportunity cost for undergoing such an intensive unsustainable projects. These funds could be utilized for needs in education and public services. With a better understanding of local coastal dynamics, community leaders hold the power to apply sound coastal and riparian zoning practices, possibly initiating a paradigm shift for the island, providing a lasting impact on how the island perceives sustainable coastal management...|$|E

Through a large volume uniaxial compression test of dredger <b>fill</b> silty <b>sand,</b> the stain-time curves under various levels of normal stress are obtained.

40|$|As well known, the ionic {{coast of}} Basilicata (Southern Italy) is {{strongly}} affected by erosion processes inducing severe critical condition for both urban areas and local tourism economic. Topographic/bathymetric information, collected by different sources like multisource platforms, IGMI cartographic data, airborne and satellite imagery, {{as well as}} echo-sound, clearly outline such processes staging from the early ’ 50 with an increasing rate observed in the ’ 60 -’ 80 period. These phenomena have different features and effects in both southern and northern parts of the coastal area, between Sinni - Agri deltas and Basento - Bradano deltas respectively, compared to the central littoral area, located between Agri - Cavone - Basento deltas. Such different effects are relevant in terms of maritime vulnerability and shoreline changes sensitivity mainly due to the drastic reduction of sediment supply from river catchments induced by human activities, land use changes, land defence interventions water resources infrastructures and management interesting all the Lucanian river basins. Further, in the last 15 years, coastal erosion produced critical effects on the Metaponto Lido area, located in the northeast part of the littoral, and characterised by typical fine sandy beaches with a shoreline of about 6 km, gently sloping off shore by 1 - 2 %, branded {{by the presence of}} 2 and 3 orders of natural bars. The urban area has a sea side town village with a longshore promenade water front designed for rehabilitation and requalification of the beach fruition. The widespread presence of permanent and seasonal structures, built on the longshore sand dune close to the foreshore, amplified the wave actions increasing the local erosion rates. The severe winter and spring sea storms in 2008 and 2009, emphasized the erosion intensity and trend until to induce structural falls and partial collapse of the promenade, changing the scenario from “ordinary” environmental risk up to civil protection setting due to the increasing coastal inundation risk. Further, during the spring 2009, a simply beach nourishment, of about 50. 000 m 3, was easily performed with any stabilization structures such as groins or breakwaters, suddenly eroded during the winter season 2009 - 2010. In such scenario, the Department of Environmental Engineering and Physics (DIFA) of Basilicata University and the Regional Authority proposed an experimental temporary intervention with a low environmental impact able to mitigate and contrast the coastal risk. The intervention aimed to reduce the spring storm damage, for both town safety and beach erosion, arranging a “no structural” stone barrier all shore long periodically moved out-beach once the storm set down. Such maintenance, performed during the spring season 2010 produced a natural beach nourishment with a sensitive average coastline advancing. The temporary intervention allowed the reduction of <b>fill</b> <b>sand</b> volume for the summer 2010 re-nourishment at 5. 000 m 3, to be located only in few parts of the interested littoral with extremely positive effect for public finance and local tourism economy. The maintenance activities have been performed even during the spring season 2011 employing the same used materials and obtaining a positive effect on the beach extension too. The temporary character of the intervention, of course, does not avoid the structural works to be further achieved for coastal protection and erosion mitigation...|$|E
40|$|Master project report. This report {{describes}} the research {{done by the}} authors to the erosion and dune migration problems in the town Ingleses. Ingleses {{is located in the}} north of Ilha Santa Catarina in Brazil. This report describes a follow-up research on the research in 2007 of project group CF 71 from Delft University of Technology. The beach erosion in the embayed beach threatens the buildings at the southern stretch of the beach. Furthermore, a large dune field, Moçambique Dune, is migrating towards the north and encroaches houses {{in the southern part of}} Ingleses. The aim off this report is to give better insight in the problem and present a solution. Research has been done to investigate the migration speed of the dune and the erosion rate of the beach. This is done by a photo analysis. Aerial photographs from several years and a Geographical Information System are used for this purpose. The average migration speed since 1938 of Moçambique Dune is a little more than three meters per year. In the southern part of Ingleses, the beach erodes one to two meters per year since 1960. The zero-solution is also a part of this research. Using the migration speed of the dune, the damage is quantified in case no measures are taken. Also the damage at the coast is quantified with the use of the erosion rates. Especially the damage at the coast will be significant. This zero-solution is a reference situation for the solution presented in this report and gives insight in the scale of the problems. A maximum loss of 1, 5 million euro’s per year is expected in case no actions are taken. The solution presented in this report is a beach nourishment. For the nourishment, sand will be used from Moçambique Dune. This way, two problems are solved at the same time. For the design fill a beach width of 38 meter will be constructed. Also an advanced fill is calculated for a design lifetime of 10 years. The design fill is calculated with the erosion rates calculated with the photo analysis. The <b>fill</b> <b>sand</b> from the dune is coarser then the sand from the native beach. For this reason the beach will be steeper after the nourishment. In the report the construction method for the nourishment is also considered. Two construction methods are elaborated, the use of trucks and the use of pumps and pipelines. For both methods an estimation is made for the construction time and the construction costs. Both construction methods are compared in a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA). In this comparison the pipelines turned out to be the better method. However, this method is more expensive. The zero-solution and the nourishment are also compared in a MCA. In this comparison the nourishment turned out to be the better solution. The nourishment is also the cheaper solution. Another aim of this project is the improvement of the numerical model made in 2007. Some scenarios are modelled in this research. The first scenario is the situation from 1938 when the sand from Moçambique Dune was an input of the system. Other scenarios are investigated to analyze the bypass at the northern headland. Finally, the scenario with the designed nourishment is modelled. The numerical model appeared to still be extremely sensitive to several parameters that still are not well-known like the wave characteristics and sediment bypass. Further extensive research to these parameters is necessary in order to obtain a reliable model. During this research a lot of additional data about the coastal system around Ingleses is collected and analyzed. Assumptions are verified and a better insight in several important parameters is given. It is concluded that a nourishment is a suitable and feasible solution for the erosion problems. The sand from the Moçambique Dune can be used for this nourishment which is a suitable solution for the encroachment problems as well. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
