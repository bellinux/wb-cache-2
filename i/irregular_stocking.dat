In this study, the influence of stand stocking on height and DBH of two even aged radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) stands were investigated using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data at a study site in New South Wales, Australia. Both stands were characterized by <b>irregular</b> <b>stocking</b> due to patchy establishment and self-thinning {{in the absence of}} any silvicultural thinning events. For the purpose of this study, a total of 34 plots from a 34 year old site and 43 plots from a nine year old site were established, from which a total of 447 trees were sampled. Within these plots, DBH and height measurements were measured and their relationships with stocking were evaluated. LiDAR was used for height estimation as well as stem counts in fixed plots (stocking). The results showed a significant relationship between stem DBH and stocking. At both locations, trees with larger diameters were found on lower stocking sites. Height values were also significantly correlated with stocking, with taller trees associated with high stocking. These results were further verified of additional tree samples, with independent field surveys for DBH and LiDAR-derived metrics for height analysis. This study confirmed the relationship between P. radiata tree heights and stem diameter with stocking and demonstrated the capacity of LiDAR to capture sub-compartment variation in these tree-level attributes...|$|E

The literature suggests a consensus {{that it is more}} efficient to allow configurations with overlapping pieces in the solution space and to penalise these in the evaluation function.

A further problem is encountered in defining a neighbourhood search strategy that can deal with the infinite solution space inherent in the irregular stock-cutting problem.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new heuristic algorithm for the two-dimensional <b>irregular</b> <b>stock</b> cutting problem, which generates significantly better results {{than the previous}} {{state of the art}} {{on a wide range of}} established benchmark problems. The developed algorithm is able to pack shapes with a traditional line representation, and it can also pack shapes that incorporate circular arcs and holes.

By utilising hill climbing and tabu local search methods the proposed technique produces 25 new best solutions for 26 previously reported benchmark problems drawn from over 20 years of cutting and packing research. These solutions are obtained using reasonable time frames, the majority of problems being solved within 5 minutes. In addition to this, we also present 10 new benchmark problems which involve both circular arcs and holes. These are provided because of a shortage of realistic industrial style benchmark problems within the literature and to encourage further research and greater comparison between this and future methods...|$|R

40|$|Optimal cut {{plans for}} cutter suction {{dredgers}} aim to maximize operational efficiency. Maximizing operational efficiency involves minimization of stoppage time resulting from non-productive dredger movements. To automate a systematic search for optimal twodimensional cut plans for cutter suction dredgers two models with an adaptive simulated annealing-based solution approach were developed. The first model, the dredge cut nesting model, optimizes <b>irregular</b> <b>stock</b> cutting problems where stencils represent dredge cuts and sheets represent dredging areas. Stencils are collections of unit dredge cuts with dimensions {{related to an}} effective cutting width which can be achieved with the cutter suction dredger considered. The objectives of the dredge cut nesting model are to maximize sheet coverage and to minimize stencil overlap. Centroids of unit dredge cuts of final nest layouts are extracted and used as grid nodes in the second model. The second model, the dredger routing model, optimizes asymmetric travelling salesperson problems with turning costs. The objectives of the dredger routing model are to minimize total route length and sum of turning angles, and to maximize average link length. A link consists {{of two or more}} route edges which are aligned with each other to within specified limits. A significant result of this research is that an engineering application of both models showed that two-dimensional cut plans for cutter suction dredgers can be systematically optimized and that dredger routes with minimum turning costs can be found. However, results also showed that the dredger routing model is not yet sophisticated enough to find cut plans for cutter suction dredgers for which overall project execution time is minimal.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} field of <b>irregular</b> {{two-dimensional}} <b>stock</b> cutting {{from the perspective of}} an industrial practitioner. The new approaches and developments in the thesis have been motivated by industrial considerations and have been used directly in industrial software applications. <b>Irregular</b> two-dimensional <b>stock</b> cutting problems occur {{in a wide range of}} industries and in almost all cases, for reasons of effective use of staff time, solution speed and efficiency, the application of the automated nesting algorithms are advantageous over manual methods. Reduction in the use of raw materials is a direct cost saving for any business and therefore has a significant impact on operating profitability. The approaches developed in this thesis have, at the time of publication, produced the best-known solutions for all of the 26 known irregular problem instances from the scientific literature. In order to explore some of the unique features of the approaches the thesis also introduces additional benchmark problems. In order to achieve these high quality solutions and attain the level of reliability required in industrial applications this work introduces a complete and robust technique for the production of no-fit polygons for irregular shapes including arcs, interlocking concavities and holes. The robustness of the technique and its ability to handle arcs and holes make this the first algorithm in the literature not to suffer from degenerate cases and makes it highly valuable to both industrial practitioners and research scientists. The placement algorithms presented in this work take advantage of the geometry of the shapes being placed in order to produce solutions to a high degree of accuracy. These placement techniques, in combination with local search techniques, achieve high quality solutions for a range of problems. Indeed these techniques are being used in industrial settings worldwide today on a range of problems in numerous industrial sectors. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

This paper introduces a robust orbital method for the creation of no-fit polygons which does not suffer from the typical problem cases found in the other approaches from the literature. Furthermore, the algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages so it is easily understood and implemented. We demonstrate how the approach handles known degenerate cases such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw type pieces and we give generation times for 32 irregular packing benchmark problems from the literature, including real world datasets, to allow further comparison with existing and future approaches...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} addressing two-dimensional (2 D) irregular shape packing {{has largely}} {{focused on the}} strip packing variant of the problem. However, {{it can be argued}} that this is a simplification. The materials from which pieces are required to be cut will ultimately have a fixed length either due to the physical dimensions of the material or through constraints on the cutting machinery. Hence, in order to cut all the pieces, multiple sheets may be required. From this scenario arises the 2 D <b>irregular</b> shape cutting <b>stock</b> problem. In this paper, we will present implementations of cutting stock approaches adapted to handle irregular shapes, including two approaches based on column generation (CG) and a sequential heuristic procedure. In many applications, setup costs can be reduced if the same pattern layout is cut from multiple sheets; hence there is a trade-off between material waste and number of patterns. Therefore, we describe the formulation and implementation of an adaptation of the CG method to control the number of different patterns. CG is a common method for the cutting stock problem; however, when the pieces are irregular the sub-problem cannot be solved optimally. Hence we implement CG and solve the subproblem using the beam search heuristic. Further, we introduce a version of CG for instances where the number of rows is less than the number of columns...|$|R

Of particular concern have been the Greek Turkish land and sea borders that {{bear the brunt of}} irregular migration and asylum seeking pressures from neighbouring and far away Asian and African countries. Migration and asylum pressures at Greece’s and the EU’s external borders are strongly influenced by geopolitical developments in the region since the Arab spring in 2011 and particularly the implosion of the Libyan regime, the conflict in Syria as well as overall instability and conflict in the Middle East. Arrivals at the Greek Turkish sea borders had peaked in 2008 - 2009 but are dramatically rising again during 2014. The Greek Turkish land border by contrast was heavily under pressure in 2010 - 2011 but has now largely been abandoned. The flows are mixed in terms of composition; young men but also families and unaccompanied children, people who flee war and political unrest as well as people migrating mainly for economic reasons. Syrians have emerged as the largest nationality group arriving at the Greek Turkish border in 2013 - 2014 while Afghans occupied the top position in 2011 - 2012. Pakistanis have consistently been among the 5 largest nationality groups but their numbers have sharply declined from nearly 20, 000 in 2011 to approx. 2, 000 in 2014. Sadly, Greece has hit the headlines for illegal pushbacks of small vessels in the Aegean, and overnight refoulements across the Evros river, but also for grimy detention centers and violence that went unpunished (see ProAsyl 2007; Human Rights Watch 2009; MSF 2014; Convictions by the European Court of Human Rights) ...|$|R

What's more, this sector is appropriate for Somerville's land availability and building stock, and it significantly contributes to Somerville's creative brand and therefore its ability to attract more Creative Class residents and businesses. To bolster this sector, Somerville should embark on sector-specific strategy to strengthen the existing consumer goods sector. The cornerstone of this effort will be the creation of an umbrella organization that will provide technical assistance, marketing, and financial assistance to local manufacturers. To support this work, Somerville will also make infrastructure investments and targeted land use policies. With these policies in place, Somerville will create jobs in Somerville for Somerville residents, extract more value from the existing land, and strengthen its "brand" as a "City of Makers. " What can other cities learn about manufacturing as an economic development activity from Somerville? When considering a manufacturing strategy, a city must consider: 1) its role within the region; 2) land availability; 3) existing building stock, and; 4) existing and nascent industry networks. Sound economic development strategies should not only attempt to foster profitable uses (tax revenues), but also uses that leverage a city's relative strengths and are aligned with their larger community and economic development goals including a range of jobs, quality of life, and perhaps most importantly, creating a strong identity and pride of place. by Anne Emig.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis belongs to the subject area of operations research. The study investigates and utilises the solution methodologies known as heuristics and local search for three practical problems related to cutting and packing using irregular shapes and multiple bins. From an application point of view, the problems domains remain in manufacturing, specifically where minimising the resources is required to meet a particular outcome. Many manufacturing processes begin with cutting desired items from a stock sheet of material, hence this study focuses on generating efficient cutting patterns, which is applicable {{in the manufacture of}} furniture, shoes, tools, ships, and garments. First, we consider designing an efficient solution procedure for solving two-dimensional irregular shape single bin size bin packing problem and two-dimensional irregular shape multiple bin size bin packing problem. Our intention is to consider alternative strategies such as placement policies, hole-filling and handling rotation of pieces; particularly with unrestricted rotations. Despite the fact that both problems are widely applicable in sheet cutting, their consideration in the literature is limited. To our knowledge, only a few authors have attempted to incorporate the first problem with the unrestricted rotation of pieces while the second problem with unrestricted rotation has not been considered at all. Being applicable in the real world, both the problems require powerful algorithms to determine the arrangement of <b>irregular</b> pieces on <b>stock</b> sheets in order to minimise the material waste. In this thesis, our focus is on developing algorithms to solve each problem efficiently. These algorithms draw on concepts in computational geometry, computer science as well as operations research. We investigate a set of newly proposed single-pass constructive algorithms that builds a feasible solution by adding pieces sequentially to a packing area defined by a set of bins which can either be homogeneous or heterogeneous. Each problem has a large solution space due to the different combinations of bins and arrangements of irregular pieces. We adopt the optimisation power of local search methods and metaheuristics to find good solutions. As one of the useful heuristic procedures, we use the Jostle heuristic (JS) to solve irregular shape single bin size bin packing problem and irregular shape multiple bin size bin packing problem due to its promising performances in handling both allocation and placement decisions of the pieces together. The Jostle was used in earlier studies for solving irregular strip packing problems and in this study we adopt it first time to solve irregular bin packing problems. Also, our implementation of Jostle handles identifying promising orientation angles of the pieces using the newly proposed angled tuning mechanism when placing pieces. Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithms can manage different variants of the problem and find solutions with good utilisation of material. For the third problem of this study, we consider multi-period irregular bin packing problem with use of residuals. This allows using leftovers of a certain period which are usable as input stock material for the next periods. Here, we expand the previous work on irregular bin packing algorithms for heterogeneous stock sheets to consider the inventory and production process of sheet cutting. We propose two models to test the impact of a variety of operational policies around the retention and reuse of residual materials in the sheet cutting process. It also examines the cost sensitivity of using residuals with respect to nine practical scenarios within those operational policies. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed multi-period approach with residuals derives better results than solving each order individually for a selected set of operational scenarios and disclose which policy would be more advantageous to operate in each scenario. The results facilitate developing a tool to guide the manufacturers to take effective decisions based on the scenarios applicable to their sheet cutting process...|$|R
