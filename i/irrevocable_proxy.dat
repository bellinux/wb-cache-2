[...] However, on August 19, 2009, THQ purchased the San Diego studio for $740,000 and extinguished Midway obligations to it. [...] On July 10, 2009, pursuant {{to the terms of}} the Settlement Agreement that was approved by the bankruptcy court, Midway agreed to pay to affiliates of its majority owner, Mark Thomas, approximately $4.7 million in full satisfaction of all Midway debt to Thomas and his affiliates, and Thomas and his affiliates granted to Midway's Creditors' Committee an <b>irrevocable</b> <b>proxy</b> to vote his controlled shares of common stock in Midway and forever relinquished the right to vote or dispose of the shares. [...] The settlement reduced Thomas's claims by 93 percent, and Midway continued to operate as a Debtor in Possession. [...] Also on July 10, 2009, the sale of assets to Warner Bros. was completed. [...] The total gross purchase price for the sale was approximately $49 million, including receivables, and Warner Bros. assumed liabilities.

40|$|This {{short article}} explores the {{circumstances}} under which the power to vote shares owned by another may be made irrevocable. Irrevocable proxies often serve as integral ingredients within corporate governance arrangements because they serve as mechanisms that enable alliances among shareowners or enhance the holder’s voting power in disproportion to the holder’s residual economic interest in the corporation. The rights and duties of holders of irrevocable proxies are best understood against a background of common-law agency relationships, in which agent and principal always have the power–albeit having contracted otherwise–to terminate their relationship and the agent’s actual authority. Courts in the United States have long recognized the existence of less fragile relationships in which one party holds a power that may be used to affect the legal position of another party but which are not agency relationships as defined by common-law agency. An <b>irrevocable</b> <b>proxy</b> is a prime example. From this vantage point the article identifies potentially problematic governance implications of irrevocable proxies. The article concludes with analysis of a recent opinion from Delaware’s Court of Chancery, In re IAC/Interactive Corp., in which an <b>irrevocable</b> <b>proxy</b> was central to the parties’ governance arrangements...|$|E

40|$|This article {{studies the}} effect of {{separating}} the voting rights attached to a share from its cash-flow rights. Such separation can be achieved through various techniques such as Dual Stock Equity, Pyramids, <b>Irrevocable</b> <b>Proxies</b> and more recently through derivatives market and securities lending platform. The techniques are a means of enjoying voting rights disproportionate to the economic exposure of the investor. Such disproportionality {{has an impact on}} the monitoring mechanism that is embedded in the institution of voting rights. The monitoring mechanism has twin facets. One is voting influence exercised by the shareholders in company meetings and second is the monitoring through the market for corporate control. The analysis proceeds by first identifying the criterion for such analysis in the essential elements of the monitoring mechanism. On applying such criterion, it is found that such impact can be positive and also negative. For the purpose of such analysis, the techniques are sub-divided into 4 categories depending on the economic exposure voting rights wedge they create. The impact is positive when it strengthens the monitoring mechanism. The impact is negative when the monitoring mechanism is diluted by such technique. Where, such technique results into a transfer of voting rights from voters who do not have appropriate incentive to vote to those who have such incentives, then such a technique should be encouraged by law. Where the impact is negative, it should be proscribed through mandatory law as opposed to vanilla disclosure regulation...|$|R
