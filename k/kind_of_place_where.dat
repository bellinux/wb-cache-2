Allen would later become one of the band's backup singers on the One Hot Minute tour.

40|$|If {{researchers}} are {{sympathetic to the}} view that young people take an active part in creating their histories, they have to be vigilant to not only what young people say, but also to the resources they employ in constructing their narratives. This paper examines the implications of former participants of a youth work organisation unexpectedly employing objects on display in the organisation’s meeting room to tell stories of transformative youth work encounters. These objects were pictures of young people receiving a civic award and candles co-created by young people and youth workers. The paper explores the practical and symbolic functions of these objects in the lives of young people. The paper also considers how a meeting room changes its meaning as a result of youth workers displaying objects linked with young people. Specifically, the meeting room may become a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> liminal <b>place</b> <b>where</b> young people can reflect on their past, present and future lives. The paper concludes by reflecting on the implications for youth work practice arising from former participants of a youth work programme investing objects on display in a youth work agency’s meeting room with symbolic significance...|$|R

40|$|The French Catholic philosopher Gabriel Marcel (1889 - 1973), {{noted for}} his {{body-mind}} theory and concept of "I & thou" {{is known to}} have had experiences involving spiritual mediums in the days of WW 1. His style of thinking is converted from idealism to so-called "philosophic concrete" by these experiences, and his interest in meta-psychology is maintained throughout his lifetime. Marcel's early work Journal metaphysique (1927) contains many pages concerning these experiences, meta-psychology, and the survival of personality. In these pages, he analyzes how the spirit appears to the living and why spiritual medium is essential to communication between the dead and the living. Marcel ponders on the role of spiritual mediums and his musings lead him to his body-mind theory afterwards. Marcel's early speculation on spiritual mediums and the medium's body also bear great influence on his later thought, especially on the concept of "intersubjectivity," which is comes to light after WW 2. Although the concept of "intersubjectivity" originally derives from Husserl's phenomenology, Marcel infuses the concept with his own unique meaning. In order to explicate Marcel's "intersubjectivity," I examine the following three concepts apparent in his thought : "passe-sujet," "ambiance spirituelle" and "profondeur. " I begin by outlining the concept of "passe-sujet," which is a compound of "past" and "subject," meaning a modality of coexistence and a situation where the pasts of different subjects interpenetrate. So "passe-sujet" can be interpreted as a situation, where clairvoyants (= spiritual mediums) penetrate the other pasts and see spirits. "Ambiance spirituelle" in contrast stands for a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> spirits can appear and where people can see them. Marcel then depicts an infinite space, as it were, a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> eternity and immortality by the French word "profondeur" which means depth. Thus I demonstrate that Marcel's concept of "intersubjectivity" does not only mean a relationship between the living, but includes a relationship between the dead and living. In this paper I carefully consider the concepts derived from his experience of spiritual mediums, and attempt to elucidate the fundamental nature of his thought on "intersubjectivity. ...|$|R
