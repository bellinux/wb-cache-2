40|$|Blind {{gain and}} phase {{calibration}} (BGPC) is a bilinear inverse problem involving {{the determination of}} unknown gains and phases of the sensing system, and the unknown signal, jointly. BGPC arises in numerous applications, e. g., blind albedo estimation in <b>inverse</b> rendering, <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar autofocus, and sensor array auto-calibration. In some cases, sparse structure in the unknown signal alleviates the ill-posedness of BGPC. Recently there has been renewed interest in solutions to BGPC with careful analysis of error bounds. In this paper, we formulate BGPC as an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and propose to solve it via power iteration, or in the sparsity or joint sparsity case, via truncated power iteration. Under certain assumptions, the unknown gains, phases, and the unknown signal can be recovered simultaneously. Numerical experiments show that power iteration algorithms work {{not only in the}} regime predicted by our main results, but also in regimes where theoretical analysis is limited. We also show that our power iteration algorithms for BGPC compare favorably with competing algorithms in adversarial conditions, e. g., with noisy measurement or with a bad initial estimate.

40|$|The {{object of}} this work is to design an {{adequate}} regularization for the problem of recovering missing Fourier coefficients, particularly in some non standard situations were low frequency coefficients are lost. In the framework of non-local regularization, we propose a technique to build an original patchwise similarity measure that is adapted to the missing spectrum. Then, a simple Non-Local quadratic energy is minimized. By construction, the similarity criterion is invariant under the corruption process so that the distance between two patches of the corrupted image is almost exactly equal to the one computed on the clean image. We illustrate our method with experiments which show its efficiency, {{both in terms of}} speed and quality of the results, with respect to other common approaches. We show that the method is practical on synthetic examples which are built upon models of <b>inverse</b> scattering problems, <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> mirrors for spatial imaging or also medical imaging...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, the growing {{interest}} {{in the field of}} homeland security and the risk monitoring, associated with natural and human induced hazards, has boosted the development of advanced radar techniques for generating high resolution radar images. <b>Inverse</b> and direct <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> Radar (ISAR/SAR) are two well radar techniques which exploit the relative motion between the target and the sensor for generating high resolution radar images of the target of interest. In this thesis a novel ISAR autofocus technique has been addressed by exploiting the estimation of the radar signal Doppler parameters. It has been tested on real datasets, and, the experimental results have been compared with the Image Contrast Autofocus Technique. Furthermore, a procedure for the mitigation of the atmospheric delay variation, which represents a main limitation for the detection and the monitoring of weak deformation patterns in Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) has been discussed. It is based on the integration of GPS atmospheric delay measurements in the multipass DInSAR processing chain.

40|$|Controlled?source {{electromagnetics}} (CSEM) {{has been}} used as a de?risking tool in the hydrocarbon exploration industry. Although there have been successful applications of CSEM, this technique is still not widely used in the industry because the limited types of hydrocarbon reservoirs CSEM can detect. In this paper, we apply the concept of <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> to CSEM data. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> allows us to design sources with specific radiation patterns for different purposes. The ability to detect reservoirs is dramatically increased after forming an appropriate <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> antenna.

We apply the concept of <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> to the lowfrequency electromagnetic field in CSEM. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> sources have been used in radar imaging for many years. Using the <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> concept, big <b>synthetic</b> sources can be constructed by adding the response to small sources (building blocks) in different ways, and consequently, big sources with different radiation patterns can be created. We show that the detectability of hydrocarbons is significantly enhanced by applying <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> to CSEM data.

The <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> technique also increases the sensitivity of the field to subsurface targets in the towing streamer acquisition.

50|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> sonar (SAS) {{is a form}} of sonar {{in which}} {{sophisticated}} post-processing of sonar data are used in ways closely analogous to <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> sonars combine a number of acoustic pings to form an image with much higher along-track resolution than conventional sonars. The along-track resolution can approach half the length of one sonar element, though is downward limited by 1/4 wavelength. The principle of <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> sonar is to move the sonar while illuminating the same spot on the sea floor with several pings. When moving along a straight line, those pings that have the image position within the beamwidth constitutes the synthetic array. By coherent reorganization of the data from all the pings, a <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> image is produced with improved along-track resolution. In contrast to conventional side-scan sonar, SAS processing provides range-independent along-track resolution. At maximum range the resolution can be magnitudes better than that of side-scan sonars.|$|R
