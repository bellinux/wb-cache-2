40|$|The {{existing}} {{greenhouse gas}} (GHG) inventory {{system and the}} National Communications (NATCOMs) could {{form the basis for}} a new framework for measuring and reporting developing country’s Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) under the future climate regime. Differentiating reporting frequency and content requirements for developed countries, emerging economies, and developing countries should be considered when constructing this new framework. • To establish a comprehensive verifi cation system and build trust among countries, all GHG reductions from developing country NAMAs should be verifi ed quantitatively. Introducing third-party verifi cation such as a peer-review system by neighboring developing countries could provide a more flexible verification system than the review process used for Annex I Parties. In the interim, developing low carbon, sustainable development strategies would help mainstream climate policies into national development plans and facilitate the monitoring and verifi cation of unilateral NAMAs. • Building a comprehensive information sharing scheme that improves access to information and registers information on bilateral and multilateral financial aid flows could reduce <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> fi nancial <b>assistance</b> and improve aid effectiveness. • Strengthening a framework for South-South cooperation, such as exchanging human resources and sharing best practices for NAMAs, is also crucial for developing a comprehensive, effective information sharing scheme on NAMAs and international support. Developing a regional registry for NAMAs would facilitate regional cooperation, and build trust at the regional level through the exchange of best practices and lessons learned. KEY MESSAGES...|$|R

40|$|Pulsed-field agarose gel {{electrophoresis}} showed that <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> chromosomal DNA in Raji cells was induced by infection with the P 3 HR- 1 strain of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). S 1 nuclease treatment of the agarose plugs containing cells suggested {{that the majority of}} DNA fragments did not contain single-strand gaps. Chromosomal DNA fragmentation was inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that protein synthesis was required for DNA fragmentation. Phosphonoacetic acid, an inhibitor of EBV DNA polymerase, did not inhibit <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> chromosomal DNA. These findings suggest that EBV-specific early proteins participate in <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> chromosomal DNA. Chromosomal DNA of P 3 HR- 1 cells was also fragmented by treatment with n-butyrate plus 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA), which induced activation of latent EBV genome following viral replication. In addition, <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> DNA preceded cell death during lytic infection. These results suggest that <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> chromosomal DNA is generally induced during EBV replication and probably contributes to the cytopathic effect of EBV.

40|$|Abstract Habitat <b>fragmentation</b> {{represents}} one <b>of</b> {{the most important}} threats to biodiversity. <b>Fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> aquatic ecosystems is pervasive, fundamentally altering aquatic community structure and ecosystem function on a worldwide scale. Because of the many ecological changes associated with hydrologic frag-mentation of coastal wetlands, there may be cascading effects on non-aquatic organisms. Here we explored if anthropogenic <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> tidal creek wetlands on Abaco Island, The Bahamas, affected bird communi-ties. By comparing fragmented and unfragmented sections of nine separate tidal creeks, we tested whether <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> coastal wetlands (due to roads) affected the richness, abundance, and composition of wetland bird assemblages.

40|$|A {{potential}} effect of ICTs {{is that they}} alleviate the traditional space-time constraints of paid-work activities and allow for the decomposition of work into multiple segments of sub-tasks, which can be performed at different times and/or locations. Such separation of activities into discrete pieces is commonly termed the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> activity. Regrettably, only limited empirical evidence {{is available on the}} <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> work activity and the factors that contribute to it. The goal {{of this paper is to}} extend the previous work in the activity fragmentation arena in three ways: (i) to operationalize measures <b>of</b> spatial <b>fragmentation</b> and reformulate some <b>of</b> the temporal <b>fragmentation</b> measures for the specific purpose <b>of</b> investigating the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> the work activity; (ii) to analyse fragmentation not only in terms of the individual indicators, but also as a multi-dimensional construct including all dimensions of spatial and temporal fragmentation collectively; (iii) to test a detailed set of ICT-related, work-related, and sociodemographic variables to identify the factors that are crucial in the occurrence <b>of</b> the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> the work activity. The study shows that there is heterogeneity in the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> work. Three internally homogeneous patterns <b>of</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> which diverge in the degree <b>of</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> are identified: (1) a less temporally and spatially fragmented work pattern; (2) a less spatially and more temporally fragmented work pattern; (3) a more spatially and temporally fragmented work pattern. The multiple discriminant analysis suggests that ICT variables and work-related variables as well as personal-household attributes are associated with the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> work. However, the degree of association differs considerably among representative patterns <b>of</b> <b>fragmentation...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> polyatomic {{molecules}} is {{a fundamental}} chemical reaction in intense laser fields when the electric field strength of the laser pulse is comparable to or exceeds the intramolecular Coulomb binding fields. For hydrocarbon molecules, because of the migration of light hydrogen atom (or proton) {{that can lead to}} chemical bond rearrangement <b>of</b> molecules, <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> hydrocarbon molecules may result in new fragment species that could not be realized from the initial geometry of molecules by direct bond breaking, making the full characterization <b>of</b> their dynamical <b>fragmentation</b> processes difficult. In this article, we will review recent progress in the study <b>of</b> <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> hydrocarbon molecules induced by intense laser fields using the coincidence momentum imaging method that can provide definite information on the <b>fragmentation</b> channels <b>of</b> molecules. The effect of hydrogen migration on <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> hydrocarbon molecules is reviewed, based on which new possible schemes for controlling chemical bond breaking/formation by controlling the motion of protons within a hydrocarbon molecule is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Although {{relationships}} between <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development {{and other forms}} of administrative and land cover fragmentation are important, they are poorly understood. This research aimed to better understand these relationships in order to inform land use planning in the Roaring Fork/Colorado River Corridor of Colorado. Change in <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development between 1985 and 1999 was modeled as a function of other forms of administrative and land cover fragmentation using two different regression specifications. While a standard “global ” regression provided a good averaged model of change for the entire study area, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) demonstrated how the process changed locally over space. Results of the global regression showed that the intercept was close to zero and therefore the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development was expected to be close to zero in the absence of other forms <b>of</b> <b>fragmentation.</b> Results <b>of</b> the GWR showed that the {{relationships between}} change in <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development and other fragmentation variables (initial edge density of urban development, edge density of public/private interface, farmland density and road density) varied significantly within the study area. By modeling this variation, GWR helped to identify ways to reduce <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development in two different regions of the study area. The analysis suggested that <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> urban development in one area, Aspen–Basalt, was more strongly driven by amenity-related variables, while in the New Castle area fragmentation was more strongly driven by infrastructure-related variables. Ultimately, local analysis may help fine-tune “one-size-fits-all ” land use polices for specific regions...|$|R

40|$|Economists have {{recommended}} the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> capacities before regulated markets are liberalized because static oligopoly models imply that outcomes approximate perfect competition with a fragmented enough market structure. This intuition fails under collusion. When individual firms are capacity constrained relative to total demand, the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> capacity facilitates collusion {{and increases the}} highest sustainable collusive price. Collusive outcomes remain feasible even for arbitrarily fragmented capacity.
