This update uses the most-recent available traffic statistics and economic forecasts, and more up-to-date information {{in terms of}} traffic trends and recent airindustry-related events. IFR movements For {{the first half of}} 2013, European traffic remained below 2012 levels. Despite the slow recovery observed over the last two months, flat economic outlook for EU, weak prospects for the Winter timetable as well as recent sharp reductions in traffic to Egypt weigh on the 2013 traffic forecast which shows a flight decline of 0. 9 % (± 0. 4 percentage point (pp)) for Europe. This is an upwards revision (+ 0. 4 pp) of the <b>flight</b> <b>forecast</b> published in February (see Ref. 1) as European traffic has nevertheless been stronger than expected during Summer, notably owing to very dynamic Russian flows. For 2014, the economic outlook remains much weaker than previously expected, and the <b>flight</b> <b>forecast</b> is for 1. 4 % growth (± 1. 5 pp) in Europe. This weak traffic growth is also explained by the continuing capacity reductions by major airlines to better match the weak demand, especially during the Winter Schedules. By 2019, the forecast anticipates 10. 8 million IFR movements in Europe, nearly 14 % more than in 2012. From 2015 onwards, the growth settles at around 2. 5 %.

In particular, {{they are used}} in the Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS 3) project during 2012, 2013, and 2014 to take measurements from the environment around tropical cyclones, and from directly above tropical cyclones. There is concern that strict adherence to the weather avoidance rules used in 2012 may sacrifice the ability to observe important science targets. We have proposed modifications to these weather avoidance rules that we believe will improve the ability to observe science targets without compromising aircraft safety. The previous guidelines, used in 2012, specified: Do not approach thunderstorms within 25 nm during flight at FL 500 or below. When flying above FL 500 : Do not approach reported lightning within 25 NM in areas where cloud tops are reported at FL 500 or higher. Aircraft should maintain at least 10000 ft vertical separation from reported lightning if cloud tops are below FL 500. No over-flight of cumulus tops higher than FL 500. No <b>flight</b> into <b>forecast</b> or reported icing conditions. No <b>flight</b> into <b>forecast</b> or reported moderate or severe turbulence Based on past experience with high-altitude flights over tropical cyclones, we have recommended changing this guidance to: Do not approach thunderstorms within 25 nm during flight at FL 500 or below. Aircraft should maintain at least 5000 ft vertical separation from significant convective cloud tops except: a) When cloud tops above FL 500 : In the event of reported significant lightning activity or indicators of significant overshooting tops, do not approach within 10 - 25 nm, depending on pilot discretion and advice from Mission Scientist. b) When cloud tops are below FL 500, maintain 10000 ft separation from reported significant lightning or indicators of significant overshooting tops. No <b>flight</b> into <b>forecasted</b> or reported icing conditions. No <b>flight</b> into <b>forecasted</b> or reported moderate or severe turbulence The key changes have to do with overflight of high convective cloud tops and those producing lightning. Experience shows that most tropical oceanic convection (including that in tropical cyclones) is relatively gentle even if the cloud tops are quite high, and can be safely overflown. Exceptions are convective elements producing elevated lightning flash rates (more than just the occasional flash, which would trigger avoidance under the previous rules) and significant overshooting cloud tops...|$|R

40|$|Flight {{cancellations}} are costly {{events for}} both airlines and passengers, yet are poorly understood. This dissertation expands upon literature that has studied flight cancellations by incorporating more variables and using advanced model specifications. In addition, {{it is necessary}} to understand the drivers of flight cancellations to quantify the relationship between flight cancellations and <b>flight</b> delay <b>forecasts,</b> which has been poorly documented in the literature. This dissertation investigates the factors leading to flight cancellations and quantifies the effect of flight cancellations on <b>flight</b> delay <b>forecasts.</b> First, econometric choice models are applied to a large dataset of historical flight information to determine the preferences and behaviors of airlines with respect to flight cancellations. The binary logit estimation results show that flight characteristics, such as load factor, distance, and flight frequency, are significant for determining the likelihood of flight cancellations, even when accounting for adverse weather effects. Airline-specific logit models indicate large heterogeneity with respect to flight cancellation tendencies across the industry. Inter-flight heterogeneity is explored through the use of mixed logit and latent class models, but lack of significant heterogeneity and long computation times provide evidence that a basic binary model can be sufficient for capturing the flight cancellation behavior of airlines. Cancellation predictions are made at an airport-level, but the distribution of predicted cancellations does not match well with the actual distribution observed in the data. Second, deterministic queueing methods are used to quantify the effect flight cancellations have on queueing delay forecasts. The cancellation model estimates are used to predict flight cancellations for a sample of all flights for 160 airport-days. The reductions in delay due to cancellations are captured using Monte Carlo simulation and a first-order approximation. The simulation results show that delays are reduced by 22 % when considering the effect of cancellations and the first-order approximation results are no more than 4 % larger than those from the Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, a case study was performed based on the current operating environment at San Francisco International Airport, where capacity reductions are expected during the summer of 2014 due to runway construction. Moreover, airlines are proposing schedules with 5 % more demand. The increased schedule combined with the capacity decrease leads to an large increase in the queueing delay forecasts. A cancellation model is used to predict the changes in delay that result from cancellations induced by the change in operating conditions. The results from the cancellation model indicate that departure cancellations will increase at an almost one-to-one ratio with the proposed demand increase, thus negating any benefit to airlines from a denser schedule. The feedback of cancellations on queueing delay is further explored with analytical models. As witnessed in the case study, queueing delay can reach a theroetical maximum where any additions to the flight schedule results in higher queueing delays and an associated increase in flight cancellations that compensate for the additional flight and return the demand, and queueing delay, to its original level...|$|R

The core of the model is given by the conflict detection and resolution module and by the directs module. Directs are flight shortcuts that are given by air controllers {{to speed up the}} passage of an aircraft within a certain airspace and therefore to facilitate airline operations. Conflicts between flight trajectories can occur for two main reasons: either the planning of the flight trajectory was not sufficiently detailed to rule out all potential conflicts or unforeseen events during the flight require modifications of the flight plan that can conflict with other flight trajectories. Our model performs a local conflict detection and resolution procedure. Once a flight trajectory has been made conflict-free, the model searches for possible improvements of the system efficiency by issuing directs. We give an example of model calibration based on real data. We then provide an illustration of the capability of our model in generating scenario simulations able to give insights about the air traffic management system. We show that the calibrated model is able to reproduce the existence of a geographical localization of air traffic controllers' operations.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{framework}} for designing and analyzing Lagrangian-type aircraft observations {{in order to}} measure surface fluxes of trace gases on regional scales. Lagrangian experiments minimize uncertainties due to advection by measuring tracer concentrations upstream and downstream of the study region, assuring that observed concentration changes represent fluxes within the region. The framework includes (1) a receptor-oriented model of atmospheric transport, including turbulent dispersion, (2) an upstream tracer boundary condition, (3) a surface flux model that predicts the distribution of tracer fluxes in time and space, and (4) a Bayesian inverse analysis that combines a priori information with observations to yield optimal estimates of tracer fluxes by the flux model. We use a receptor-oriented transport model, the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model, to simulate ensembles of particles representing air parcels transported backward in time from an observation point (receptor), linking receptor concentrations with upstream locations and surface inputs. STILT provides the capability to <b>forecast</b> <b>flight</b> tracks for Lagrangian experiments in the presence of atmospheric shear and dispersion. STILT may be used to <b>forecast</b> <b>flight</b> tracks that sample the upstream tracer boundary condition, or to analyze the data and provide optimized parameters in the surface flux model. We present a case study of regional scale surface CO 2 fluxes using data over the United States obtained in August 2000 in the CO 2 Budget and Rectification Airborne (COBRA- 2000) study. STILT forecasts were obtained using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Eta model to plan the flight tracks. Results from the Bayesian inversion showed large reductions in a priori errors for estimates of daytime ecosystem uptake of CO 2, but constraints on nighttime respiration fluxes were weaker, due to few observations of CO 2 in the nocturnal boundary layer. Derived CO 2 fluxes from the influence-following analysis differed notably from estimates using a conventional one-dimensional budget ("Boundary Layer Budget'') on a typical day, due to time-variable contributions from forests and croplands. A critical examination of uncertainties in the Lagrangian analyses revealed that the largest uncertainties were associated with errors in forecasting the upstream sampling locations and with aggregation of heterogeneous fluxes at the surface.
