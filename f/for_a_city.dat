5|$|In 1887 Selfe {{published}} proposals <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> underground railway, with stations at Wynyard, the Rocks and Circular Quay, and a loop to Woolloomooloo and {{the eastern}} suburbs. The proposal included a bridge across Sydney Harbour for trains, vehicles and pedestrians. He presented these schemes to the Royal Commission on City and Suburban Railways in 1890; but nothing was to come of it, largely because the 1890s depression brought public works initiatives to a standstill.|$|E

On the edges of town, some architects began exploring that style's Picturesque mode. A new row of townhouses at Washington Park went up, and another Second Street row followed in 1855.

5|$|Docherty {{remained}} {{a member of}} the Communist Party for 70 years, at times working with Alex Moffat and Abe Moffat. She campaigned for J. V. Leckie when he was a candidate for the Dunfermline Burghs constituency. She worked for Willie Gallacher, the communist Member of Parliament for Fife, for several years, and in 1952 unsuccessfully ran <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> council seat. At various points, Docherty held the positions of treasurer, Women's Group leader, and secretary for the Fife branch of the Communist Party. She retired from active political life when she was 60 years old, but despite being crippled by arthritis, participated in fundraising efforts for the newspaper Morning Star. She lived in a modest house in Cowdenbeath, and spent her time working on her memoirs. She continued to give talks and participate in International Women's Day events nearly every year until her death.|$|E
5|$|In February 1976, Koubek {{contributed a}} third {{high-rise}} office building to Farragut Square, {{this one a}} brick-and-solarized glass structure with a glass-and-aluminum penthouse at 818 Connecticut Avenue NW. His massive, grid-like 400 North Capitol Street, {{one of the few}} office buildings he designed with a plaza between two wings, opened in June. His 12-story International Square building—with its inverted setbacks above the Farragut West Washington Metro station, ninth-floor balcony with non-structural columns, interior atrium, and ground level set-back retail concourse—opened in November. Originally just a single office building on a corner <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> block, it expanded to occupy nearly the entire block with the addition of two almost identical towers in 1979 and 1980. (The atrium was upgraded and a fountain added in 1992.) Two blocks to the west, in April 1977 Koubek also designed a fairly nondescript office building at 1990 K Street NW.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{the city of}} Bellevue began {{studying}} a possible civic center with a new city hall, courthouses, a jail, a museum and a basketball arena for the Seattle SuperSonics. The civic center plan was scaled back to a single convention center in downtown Bellevue, Meydenbauer Center, and a new downtown library, both of which opened in 1993; the plan <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> hall was seen as controversial and unnecessary at the time. In 1990, the city hall area was proposed {{as the site of}} a county jail and courthouse to serve the Eastside. The proposed site, located north of city hall, was seen as undesirable because of its existing wetlands and was rejected in favor of a site near Overlake Hospital Medical Center.|$|E

5|$|Just as World War I had a {{significant}} impact on the college, World War II was pivotal in the college's history too. Within four days of the attack on Pearl Harbor, thirteen students withdrew from the college to join the military. The enrollment dropped from 2,077 students in 1940 to a low of 860 students (21% were men) in spring 1943. Faculty decreased to as low as 60 from 112 before the war had begun. Before the war was over, 3,500 SDSC graduates, students, former students, and faculty entered the armed forces, with 135 losing their lives. Not surprisingly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> dominated by a naval base, a large majority joined the Navy. Others joined the Air Corps, participating in the Doolittle Raid over Japan and battles over the Philippines and the East Indies.|$|E

There is a higher-than-average level of car ownership. 36.4% of all households do not have a car. Less than 5% of the population travel to work by public transport compared with 15% nationally. The district is one of the lowest non-white populations, with the census reporting 98.8% of the inhabitants being white. Hull itself is also quite monoethnic <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> of its size, with the census reporting 97.7% white.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} {{financial problems}} with Seattle Transit put the Blue Streak program in jeopardy, leading to calls {{to suspend the}} program before it launched. Service was originally slated to begin in 1968, and delays led {{to the federal government}} establishing a deadline in early 1969 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> decision on whether to move forward. A park and ride lot in Northgate was secured in August 1969, settling the demands of the federal government. The United States Department of Transportation approved $2 million in operating funds for Blue Streak in January 1970, providing two-thirds of the system's operating budget for {{the first two years of}} service.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of the Westridge area on the 1928 electoral roll numbered over 130. At the , Yarralumla had a {{population of}} 2,890 people. Of these 46.9% were male. The suburb had only 1.0% indigenous Australians, substantially {{below the national average}} of 2.8%. The percentage of married people in the suburb was nine points higher than the national average, and the proportion of residents who had never married was 9 points lower. Despite the higher level of marriage, this did not translate into a higher level of children; 49.6% of families consisted of a couple without children in the household, compared to the national average of 37.8%. Yarralumla residents had a median age of 49, compared to a Canberra average of 35. The suburb had an older population <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> of young people; the median national age is 38 and 41.7% of Yarralumla residents were 55 or over, compared to the national figure of 27.6%.|$|E
5|$|Following long-standing custom <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> {{taken by}} storm, the plundering {{of the city}} lasted for three days. Over seven {{thousand}} Thessalonians were taken captive to be sold in the slave markets of the Balkans and Anatolia, although many were subsequently ransomed by the Despot of Serbia, Đurađ Branković. The city's monuments suffered heavy damage in the sack, particularly the cathedral of Hagios Demetrios, as soldiers ransacked them for precious objects and hidden treasure. This damage was compounded later when the Sultan ordered that marble sections be stripped from them and taken to his capital, Adrianople, to pave a bath. On the fourth day, Sultan Murad entered the city himself and prayed at the Church of the Acheiropoietos, which became the city's first mosque. The Sultan then restored order and took measures to revive the city, evicting the soldiers from the homes they had occupied and returning them to their owners. According to Anagnostes, 7,000 inhabitants, including himself, were taken captive to be sold as slaves; only 2,000 {{of the population was}} left after the sack, many of which soon converted to Islam. The Sultan soon took measures to repopulate the city. He promised to return their properties to those inhabitants who had fled if they returned, and in some cases even ransomed captives from the sack himself. He also brought in Muslim and Christian settlers from other areas of Macedonia. A great number of empty houses were confiscated and given to the settlers, while most of the main churches were converted to mosques. The Turks settled mostly in {{the upper part of the}} city, from where they could better control it.|$|E
