5|$|Many early {{reports of}} the riots, {{starting}} with one from Reuters, used a picture purporting to show the previous day's riots. The photo, showing large number of People's Armed Police squares, was one taken of the 2009 Shishou riot and originally published on 26 June by Southern Metropolis Weekly. The same picture was mistakenly used by other agencies; {{it was on the}} website of The Daily Telegraph, but was removed a day later. In an interview with Al Jazeera on 7 July, WUC leader Rebiya Kadeer used the same Shishou photograph to defend the Uyghurs in Ürümqi. A World Uyghur Congress representative later apologised, explaining that the photo was chosen out of hundreds for its <b>image</b> <b>quality.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{promotion}} {{strategy for}} the film played on nationalist sentiment by announcing that La tragedia del silencio was the first authentically Colombian movie. It was first screened to the public on 18 July 1924 in Faenza theatre in Bogotá, attracting a large audience. There were several technical problems including power failure and projector errors, caused in particular by the nervousness of the director and his son, {{the director of the}} theatre Joaquín Francisco, and operator Gustavo Francisco. However, the film was well received by the public and the press, although some viewers complained about the poor <b>image</b> <b>quality.</b> The theatre was crowded during the seventeen showings of the film, but it was not very successful financially.|$|E

Although the first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> obtained was drastically lower than expected. Images of point sources spread out over a radius of more than one arcsecond, instead of having a point spread function (PSF) concentrated within a circle 0.1arcsec in diameter as had been specified in the design criteria.|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} for object segmentation using deformable contours is presented. This framework aims to extract multiple objects whose shapes are similar, but whose <b>image</b> <b>qualities</b> are different. Objects with good <b>image</b> <b>qualities</b> are called "strong objects," and objects with bad <b>image</b> <b>qualities</b> are called "weak objects. " Our framework {{is based on}} the deformable contours method where a new kind of energy is introduced to handle sharing of properties between objects, and also to allow contours of strong objects to guide the deformation of contours of weak objects. Weighting parameters are automatically generated and used as control parameters in the contour guiding scheme. Dynamic programming is used for implementation of the multiple snake optimization framework. Comprehensive testing has been performed on natural images and synthetic images and the results are encouraging...|$|R
5|$|At its widest aperture, the {{sharpness}} {{does not}} meet the 1800 threshold at either 8mm (1572, f/4.5) or 12mm (1356, f/5), but at 16mm (f/5.6) it achieves over 2000 lines per picture height. However, stopping down improves the sharpness at all focal lengths, according to PC Magazine. At 8mm, 1800 is reached at f/8, while at 12mm it is still only at 1509 by f/8. The <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> is asymmetric with better performance on the right side. At 8mm and f/4.5, it has 1 blur unit in the center and 1.5 in the corners. Although the images are slightly sharper at f/5.6, SLR Gear claims sharpness declines significantly at f/11 to almost 2 blur units with further stopping down increasing blur to 3.5 at f/22. At the longer focal lengths for this lens, stopping down to f/29 yields a 5 blur unit result.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One is {{equipped}} with a 4.0-megapixel rear-facing camera module that contains a custom image sensor marketed as UltraPixel, which is composed of pixels that are 2.0µm in size. Most high-end smartphones {{at the time of its}} release used 8- or 13-megapixel cameras with pixel sizes ranging from 1.4 to 1.0µm, both of which are considerably smaller in size than the pixels found in the One’s UltraPixel sensor. Although these smaller pixel sizes were typically necessary to ensure that the camera sensor did not compromise the design of the phone, there were concerns that this could result in a loss of dynamic range and sensitivity, and also result in poor performance in low-light environments. As such, HTC stated that its camera design with larger sensor pixels could notably increase overall <b>image</b> <b>quality,</b> especially in low-light environments. The camera also includes optical image stabilization, and is further enhanced by improvements to the Sense camera software and the ImageChip 2 image processor.|$|E
25|$|A very {{effective}} measure of both protection {{to both the}} staff and the patient of course is applying less radiation. There is always a trade-off between radiation dose and <b>image</b> <b>quality.</b> A higher x-ray dose leads to a clearer picture. Modern software technology can improve <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> during post-processing, such that the same <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> is reached with a lower dose. <b>Image</b> <b>quality</b> thereby is described by contrast, noise, resolution and artifacts. In general, the ALARA principle (as low as reasonably achievable) should be followed. Dose should be as low as possible, but <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> can only be reduced to the level that the diagnostic benefit of the examination is still higher than the potential harm to the patient.|$|E
40|$|A {{framework}} for multiple object segmentation using deformable contours is proposed. This framework aims to extract objects whose shapes are similar, but whose <b>image</b> <b>qualities</b> are different. Objects with good <b>image</b> <b>qualities</b> are called "strong objects," and objects with bad <b>image</b> <b>qualities</b> are called "weak objects". The proposed framework {{is based on}} the deformable contours method which is an energy minimization approach. A new kind of energy is introduced to handle sharing of properties across multiple objects, and also to allow contours of strong objects to guide contours of weak objects. In some applications, a model can be given as prior knowledge to aid object shape estimation, whereas in other applications, a model cannot be provided. The proposed framework has been designed to support both cases. Moreover, the framework is robust under affine transformations: translation, rotation, and scaling...|$|R

25|$|While the {{practicality}} of CBCT fosters its increasing {{application in}} IR, technical limitations hinder its {{integration into the}} field. The two most significant factors that affect successful integration are <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> and time (for set up, image acquisition, and image reconstruction). Compared to MDCT, the wider collimation in CBCT leads to increased scatter radiation and degradation of <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> as demonstrated by artifacts and decreased contrast-to-noise ratio. The temporal resolution of cesium iodide detectors in CBCT slows data acquisition time to approximately 5 to 20 seconds, which increases motion artifact. The time required for image reconstruction takes longer for CBCT (1 minute) compared to MDCT (real time) due to the computationally demanding cone beam reconstruction algorithms.|$|E
