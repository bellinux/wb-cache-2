The General Assembly also passed the Indiana Civil Rights bill in 1963, granting equal protection to minorities in seeking employment. In 1970 a series of constitutional amendments were passed.

5|$|Minnesota's {{court system}} has three levels. Most cases {{start in the}} {{district}} courts, which are courts of general jurisdiction. There are 279 district court judgeships in ten judicial districts. Appeals from the trial courts and challenges to certain governmental decisions are heard by the Minnesota Court of Appeals, consisting of nineteen judges who typically sit in three-judge panels. The seven-justice Minnesota Supreme Court hears all appeals <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> court, the workers' compensation court of appeals, first-degree murder convictions, and discretionary appeals from the court of appeals; it also has original jurisdiction over election disputes.|$|E
5|$|One of Fletcher's {{priorities}} {{that was}} not resolved during the session was the correction of unintended tax increases on businesses that resulted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> reform plan passed in 2005. Fletcher called a special legislative session for mid-June so that the legislature could amend the plan and also authorize tax breaks designed to lure a proposed FutureGen power plant to Henderson. Republican Senate President David L. Williams asked Fletcher to include tax breaks for other businesses as well, but Fletcher insisted on a sparse legislative agenda. The session convened for five days and passed the tax breaks and amended tax reform plan unanimously in both houses. Fletcher applauded the legislature's efficiency.|$|E

5|$|John's son, King Henry III, {{assessed}} the carucage on three occasions, in 1217, 1220, and 1224. A new approach in 1217 and 1220 was {{to secure the}} consent of leading noblemen for the tax to be levied. The 1217 tax was once again assessed at 3shillings per carucate. The assessment {{of the amount of}} lands held by each taxpayer involved having each landowner provide the information and swear an oath that it was correct. Like the 1200 tax, the 1217 tax was not recorded in that year's Pipe Roll, lending support to the possibility that the revenue <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> was sent to a separate branch of the Exchequer. The 1217 carucage was only paid by laymen; the clergy made a donation in lieu of being taxed. The money raised was intended to defray the expense of the war being fought against Prince Louis of France, who had invaded England before the death of King John and was claiming the English throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{budget of}} the series is {{estimated}} to be £15 million. Filming began in February 2013 and concluded in August 2013, with location shooting largely taken place in Kent and northern France. Filming in Kent was based in Discovery Park in Sandwich and was supported by the Kent Film Office. A former Pfizer facility was used as a number of sets, including the Calais police station and Elise's apartment. The series was filmed throughout five districts: Canterbury, Dover, Shepway, Swale and Thanet. Several prominent locales were featured, including Folkestone Harbour; The Turner Contemporary art gallery; Westwood Cross shopping centre; and the towns of Dover, Folkestone and Margate. Production also made use of the Kent Film Office's legal powers to close certain roads for uninterrupted filming. An estimated £2.5 million of the budget was spent on, among other services, accommodation, locations, parking and catering, providing a boost for the Kent economy. The filming in France was supported by the Nord-Pas de Calais Film Commission and benefited <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tax</b> Rebate International. Shooting took place over 31 days across Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais and Dunkerque.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} people counted in the census of 1381 was 59,873,305; however, this number dropped {{significantly}} when the government found that some 3 million people were missing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> census of 1391. Even though underreporting figures was made a capital crime in 1381, the need for survival pushed many to abandon the tax registration and wander from their region, where Hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on the populace. The government tried to mitigate this by creating their own conservative estimate of 60,545,812 people in 1393. In his Studies on the Population of China, Ho Ping-ti suggests revising the 1393 census to 65 million people, noting that large areas of North China and frontier areas were not counted in that census. Brook states that the population figures gathered in the official censuses after 1393 ranged between 51 and 62 million, while the population was in fact increasing. Even the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–505) remarked that the daily increase in subjects coincided with the daily dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers. William Atwell states that around 1400 the population of China was perhaps 90 million people, citing Heijdra and Mote.|$|E
