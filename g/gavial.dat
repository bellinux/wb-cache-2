500|$|A {{percentage}} value {{called the}} [...] "camouflage index" [...] gauges Snake's exposure, {{on a scale}} from negative values (highly visible and attracting attention) up to 100% (completely invisible to the enemy). In order to minimize visibility, the player must switch between different camouflage uniforms and face paints to blend in with the environment; for example, wearing a bark-patterned uniform while leaning against a tree, or wearing striped face paint while hiding in tall grass. Other devices for camouflage, such as a fake <b>gavial</b> head to decrease chances of being detected in water, are also available.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not cleverness, child, {{but only}} thought. A little thought {{in life is}} like salt upon rice, as the boatmen say, and I have thought deeply always. The <b>Gavial,</b> my cousin, the fish-eater, has told me {{how hard it is}} for him to follow his fish, and how one fish differs from the other, and how he must know them all, both {{together}} and apart. I say that is wisdom; but, on the other hand, my cousin, the <b>Gavial,</b> lives among his people. MY people do not swim in companies, with their mouths out of the water, as Rewa does; nor do they constantly rise {{to the surface of the}} water, and turn over on their sides, like Mohoo and little Chapta; nor do they gather in shoals after flood, like Batchua and Chilwa." ...|$|E

50|$|Champsosauridae is {{the best-known}} {{family of the}} Choristodera and typifies the group. Champsosaurus was first {{described}} from Late Cretaceous strata of Montana by Cope in 1876. Champsosaurs resembled modern gharials (<b>gavials)</b> or false gharials. The skull of these animals have a long, thin snout filled with small, sharp conical teeth. This is due to champsosaurs and gharials occupying similar niches: hunting small aquatic prey in rivers and swamps. This {{is a classic example}} of convergent evolution. More primitive choristoderes have shorter, broader snouts.|$|R
50|$|As {{a typical}} gavialoid, Aktiogavialis {{followed}} the standard crocodilian body plan. An elongated, squat quadrupedal body terminated in a long, laterally flattened tail at one end, and a specialized, narrow snout at the other. As {{with the other}} members of its family, the snout of Aktiogavialis was extremely long and narrow, tapering into a thin structure past the eye sockets. Based on the fragmentary remains recovered, the species was differentiated from other members of its family by unique positioning and geometry of its skull elements. Phylogenetic analysis indicates its closest relatives were the extinct <b>gavials</b> Gryposuchus and Siquisiquesuchus.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{characters}} of the animated series The Venture Bros. is named Brock Samson. Like the Biblical hero, he has long flowing hair and incredible strength, as well a short, violent temper. He also is capable of unarmed combat with wild animals (<b>gavials</b> and polar bears, among others), like the Biblical Samson who fought a lion. He also engages in romantic relationships with morally ambiguous women. However, his strength {{seems to have no}} relation to his hair; indeed, he cuts it off himself at one point to lay a trap for his rival, with no ill effects.|$|R

60|$|Talking to Melissa {{in a time}} of {{commercial}} trouble, I found her disposed to speak pathetically of the disgrace which had fallen on Sir <b>Gavial</b> Mantrap, because of his conduct in relation to the Eocene Mines, and to other companies ingeniously devised by him for the punishment of ignorance in people of small means: a disgrace by which the poor titled gentleman was actually reduced to live in comparative obscurity on his wife's settlement of one or two hundred thousand in the consols.|$|E

5000|$|Trematosauridae are {{a family}} of large temnospondyl {{amphibians}} with many members. They first appeared during the Olenekian stage of the Early Triassic, and existed until around the Carnian stage of the Late Triassic, although by then they were very rare. By the Middle Triassic they had become widespread throughout Laurasia and Gondwana with fossils being found in Europe, Asia, Madagascar, and Australia. They {{are one of the}} most derived families of the Trematosauroidea superfamily in that they are the only family that have fully marine lifestyles. Long, slender snouts that are characteristic of the trematosaurids, with some members having rostrums resembling those of modern-day <b>gavials.</b> Traditionally, two subfamilies within Trematosauridae can be identified, the relatively short-nosed Trematosaurinae and the long-nosed Lonchorhynchinae. A third subfamily, Tertreminae, was named in 2000 and includes broad-snouted forms like Tirraturhinus.

50|$|Asia has a rich reptile fauna. Earless monitor lizards, snakes of the {{families}} Uropeltidae, Acrochordidae and Xenopeltidae and <b>gavials</b> are endemic to Asia. The crocodiles include mugger crocodile, gharial, false gharial and saltwater crocodile. The more common of the numerous snakes are pipe snakes (Melanophidium, Plectrurus, Rhinophis, Uropeltis), sea snakes, Elapids (king cobra, Bungarus, Calliophis, Naja, Walterinnesia), vipers (Azemiops, Daboia, Dendrelaphis, Echis, Hypnale, Protobothrops, Trimeresurus, Ovophis, Pseudocerastes, Gloydius etc.), colubrids (Achalinus, Amphiesma, Boiga, Calamaria, Cerberus, Coluber, Enhydris, Lycodon, Oligodon, Opisthotropis, Rhabdophis, Pareas, Psammophis, Ptyas, Sibynophis, Spalerosophis, Trachischium etc.) and blind snakes.

60|$|I {{will not}} repeat {{my answer to}} Melissa, for I fear it was offensively brusque, my opinion being that Sir <b>Gavial</b> was the more pernicious scoundrel of the two, since his name for virtue served as an {{effective}} part of a swindling apparatus; and perhaps I hinted that to call such a man moral showed rather a silly notion of human affairs. In fact, I had an angry wish to be instructive, and Melissa, as will sometimes happen, noticed my anger without appropriating my instruction, for I have since heard that she speaks of me as rather violent-tempered, and not over strict in my views of morality.|$|E

40|$|Crocodilian is {{a common}} name used to refer broadly to crocodiles, alligators, caimans and <b>gavials.</b> All of them belong to the Order Crocodylia. These animals are {{widespread}} occupants of aquatic environments in tropics and subtropics, with a few species reaching into the warm temperate zones. They are prominent animals due to their large size and, in some situations, ferocity. Ecologically they are considered as key species, {{in the top of}} the food web of the ecosystems they occupy. There are 23 extant crocodilians, grouped in three families (or sub-families according to some) : The Gavialidae, with only one species (Gavialis gangeticus); the Alligatoridae, with eight species, seven of them found in America and one in China; the Crocodylidae, of pantropical distribution, with 14 species (King and Burke 1997). The American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) and the Orinoco crocodile (C. intermedius) are two of the four species of crocodilians found in the Neotropics. These are species of contrasting historical distribution. The former is restricted to the lowlands of the Orinoco River drainage in Colombia and Venezuela, whereas the American crocodile is widely distributed and is found in rivers, coastal and lowlan...|$|R
50|$|Rathke {{pointed out}} that {{on the surface of}} certain folds of the integument, {{especially}} in the region of the jaws, are found in all Crocodilia certain small, scattered, wart-like elevations, around each of which is customarily a narrow, shallow, circular groove; they usually have a dark brown but sometimes a gray or even white color. Microscopic examination shows these warts to be of epidermal origin, consisting of bright, round cells that are closely united, without visible intercellular substance. Treatment with potassium hydroxide and then with water will show sometimes, though not always, fine granular nuclei in the cells. In probably all members of the genus Crocodilus, at least is found, on the thickswelling on the right and {{on the left side of}} the neck and trunk, a small, flat pit which has the appearance of the opening of an integumental gland. The pits are present also in the scales of the throat, under the side of the neck, sides of the body, lateral and ventral surfaces of the anterior half of the tail, and the legs. They are near the hinder border of the scales. Only occasionally are two pits found in one scale. These pits are found in the <b>gavials</b> but are absent in some, probably all, alligators. A small knob projects from the center of some of the pits. These pits are not openings of glands but have about the same structure as the pits seen in the head.|$|R
