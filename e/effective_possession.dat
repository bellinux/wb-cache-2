According to Catholic theologians, demonic assault can be involuntary and allowed by God to test a person (for more details about God's tests on persons see Job). Involuntary demonic assault, according to these theologians, cannot be denied because this would imply the negation of the cases mentioned in the New Testament (12, some of them repeated in more than one Gospel). However, in the overwhelming majority of cases of alleged demonic possession in modern times, the victim can suffer due to any of a number of personal initiatives: occult practices, mortal sin, loss of faith, or psychological trauma, among others. Furthermore, Malachi Martin goes as far as to say [...] "...no person can be Possessed without some degree of cooperation on his or her part," [...] and [...] "The <b>effective</b> cause of <b>Possession</b> is the voluntary collaboration of an individual, through his faculties of mind and will, with one or more of those bodiless, genderless creatures called demons." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Health {{ministries}} and providers are rapidly scaling up insecticide-treated nets (ITN) distribution to control malaria, yet possession and proper use typically remain below targeted levels. In Malawi, health facilities (HFs) are currently the principal points of ITN distribution, making {{it important to}} understand how access to these ITN sources affects ownership, possession, and use. The authors evaluated the association between proximity to HFs and ITN possession or use among Malawian children six to 59 months of age. Methods A household malaria survey undertaken in eight districts of Malawi during 2007 was used to characterize ITN possession and use. The location of each respondent's household was geocoded as was those of Ministry of Health (MoH) HFs and other health centres. Euclidean distance from each household to the nearest HF was calculated. Patterns of net possession and use were determined through descriptive methods. The authors then analysed the significance of distance and ITN possession/use through standard statistical tests, including logistic regression. Results Median distance to HFs was greater among households that did not possess ITNs and did not use an ITN the previous evening. Descriptive statistical methods confirmed a pattern of decreasing ITN possession and use with increasing distance from HFs. Logistic regression showed the same statistically significant association of distance to HFs, even when controlling for age and gender of the child, ratio of nets to children in household, community net possession and use, and household material wealth.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{evidence}} from 2 previous meta-analyses that interventions to promote poison prevention behaviours {{are effective in}} increasing a range of poison prevention practices in households with children. The published meta-analyses compared any intervention against a "usual care or no intervention" which potentially limits {{the usefulness of the}} analysis to decision makers. We aim to use network meta-analysis to simultaneously evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions to increase prevalence of safe storage of i) Medicines only, ii) Other household products only, iii) Poisons (both medicines and non-medicines), iv) Poisonous plants; and v) Possession of poison control centre (PCC) telephone number in households with children. METHODS: Data on the effectiveness of poison prevention interventions was extracted from primary studies identified in 2 newly-undertaken systematic reviews. Effect estimates were pooled across studies using a random effects network meta-analysis model. RESULTS: 28 of the 47 primary studies identified were included in the analysis. Compared to usual care intervention, the intervention with education and low cost/free equipment elements was most effective in promoting safe storage of medicines (odds ratio 2. 51, 95 % credible interval 1. 01 to 6. 00) while interventions with education, low cost/free equipment, home safety inspection and fitting components were most effective in promoting safe storage of other household products (2. 52, 1. 12 to 7. 13), safe storage of poisons (11. 10, 1. 60 to 141. 50) and possession of PCC number (38. 82, 2. 19 to 687. 10). No one intervention package was more effective than the others in promoting safe storage of poisonous plants. CONCLUSION: The most effective interventions varied by poison prevention practice, but education alone was not the most effective intervention for any poison prevention practice. Commissioners and providers of poison prevention interventions should tailor the interventions they commission or provide to the poison prevention practices they wish to promote. HIGHLIGHTS: Network meta-analysis is useful for comparing multiple injury-prevention interventions. More intensive poison prevention interventions were more effective than education alone. Education and low cost/free equipment was most effective in promoting safe storage of medicines. Education, low cost/free equipment, home safety inspection and fitting was most effective in promoting safe storage of household products and poisons.

50|$|Dòmhnall Gallach succeeded to the chiefship {{after the}} death of Gilleasbaig Dubh. In 1521, the chief {{rendered}} a bond of manrent to Sir John Campbell of Cawdor. A and A Macdonald stated that this bond may have led the Sleat chief to follow Cawdor, in 1523, on the Duke of Albany's campaign against England. The campaign did not go well for the two chiefs, as both Sleat and Cawdor's names are recorded on a remission for leaving the field of battle during the siege of Wark Castle. A and A Macdonald also stated that it was likely on their return from the borders that Cawdor and his followers (including Sleat) murdered Lachlann Cattanach Maclean of Duart, in Edinburgh. In 1524, Dòmhnall Gruamach entered into an alliance with the chief of Clan Mackintosh; and later in 1527, he entered into bonds with Mackintosh, Munro, Rose of Kilravock and Campbell of Cawdor. In 1528, Dòmhnall Gruamach received considerable support from his half-brother, Iain, son of Torquil, chief of Clan Macleod of Lewis. That year their combined forces were successful in driving out the Macleods of Harris & Dunvegan, and their vassals, from the barony of Trotternish. Dòmhnall Gruamach, in return, then aided Macleod of Lewis in obtaining <b>effective</b> <b>possession</b> of Lewis. Macleod of Harris & Dunvegan then appealed to the Privy Council, and that year a summons was issued to the chiefs of Sleat and Lewis.

The following year Sleat, Macleod of Harris & Dunvegan, and Mackinnon of Strathardill were frequently cited before Parliament but failed to appear. After 1530, Dòmhnall Gallach's chiefship seems to have been uneventful and peaceful, as there is no record of his name in state records until his death, in about 1537.|$|E
50|$|The institutio corporalis, {{also called}} investitura, or installatio, is the putting of a titular in <b>effective</b> <b>{{possession}}</b> of his benefice. Whereas canon law permits a bishop {{to put himself}} in possession of his benefice (see canonical provision), {{in the case of}} minor benefices it requires an actual installation by a competent authority. The bishop may punish any one who takes possession of a benefice on his own authority, and the violent occupation of a benefice in possession of another ecclesiastic entails on the guilty party the loss of all right to that benefice. The right of installation formerly belonged to archdeacons, but is now reserved to the bishop, his vicar-general, or his delegate, ordinarily the dean (decanus christianitatis or foraneus). It is performed with certain symbolical ceremonies, determined by local usage or by diocesan statutes, such, for instance, as a solemn entry into the parish and into the church, the handing over of the church keys, a putting in possession of the high altar of the church, the pulpit, confessional, etc. In some countries there is a double installation: the first by the bishop or vicar-general, either by mere word of mouth, or by some symbolical ceremony, as, for instance, presenting a biretta; the second, which is then a mere ceremony, taking place in the parish and consisting in the solemn entry and other formalities dependent on local custom. In some places custom has even done away with the institutio corporalis properly so called; the rights inherent to the putting in possession are acquired by the new titular to the benefice by a simple visit to his benefice, for instance, to his parish, with the intention of taking possession thereof, provided such visit is made with the authority of the bishop, thus precluding the possibility of self-investiture. When the pope names the titular to a benefice, he always mentions those who are to put the beneficiary in possession.|$|E

The beauty and climate of the valley attracted some of the Mughal emperors of Delhi, and the remains exist of a garden planted by Shah Jahan. According to the Gazetteer of Kurram, {{the richness of the}} land gradually weaned the Turks from their nomadic life. Sections built villages and settled permanently; they ceased to be Kuchi and became Kothi this abandonment of their nomadic habits by the majority of the resulted, as it was bound to do, in a contraction of the area in <b>effective</b> <b>possession.</b> The upper Kurram plain was safe as their headquarters, but hills and slopes below the Safed Koh and Mandher over which their graziers had kept an efficient watch, now afforded a menace as a place in which an encroaching tribe could establish itself. To guard against this settlements of Mangals and Muqbols or Muqbils were half invited half allowed to push themselves in conditions of vassalage, and on promise to afford a buttress against any enemy aggression. In the lower Kurram, where for climatic reasons candidates for settlements were fewer, the problem was not easily solved. The Chardi Turis seem to have been the first to abandon their nomadic life. As the numbers who went down to graze every year became less,the area under control contracted. Sangroba and Hadmela were left far behind and as the Turis receded the Watizai Zaimushts gradually pushed in, until all that was left was a settlement at and about Alizai. On the western side the Saragallas retained, and still largely retain their habits. They too put in settlements around Biliamin and after much intervening warfare had finally to admit Bangashes brother not as vassals, but for the rest they retain unimpaired the rights on the western bank which they acquired at the time the conquest.With Chardis this was for from being the course left unsupported by their Kuchis they maintained a precarious existence at Alizai until even then they had to give three-fifths of their land to the Watizai Zaimushts in return for their assistance in a feud they had entered upon with Bilyamin. Consequently the hills and the grazing grounds passed from the Turizun to the Zaimushtzun and as the other Zaimushts section being unopposed had settled themselves on the left bank below Sadda.|$|E

40|$|A Study on the Solutions of Dokdo Problem {{based on}} the Criteria for the Decision of International Court by Young Min Youn Major in Maritime Law and Policy Department of Maritime Traffic Information The Graduate School of Korea Maritime University Abstract There are several {{criteria}} for deciding the sovereignty of disputed territory. For example, the principle of <b>effective</b> <b>possession,</b> historical title, geographical situations, diplomatic documents and special circumstances would be the criteria for the decision. Among these, the most significant criterion in territorial disputes is the principle of <b>effective</b> <b>possession.</b> The evidences of <b>effective</b> <b>possession</b> {{can be found in}} historical archives and intergovernmental documents. This principle of <b>effective</b> <b>possession</b> has been repeatedly adopted in several cases. For example, the international courts adopted the principle in the Palmas Island case and in the Minquiers - Ecrehos case. These courts required that the <b>effective</b> <b>possession</b> of the disputed areas should be peaceful, actual and continuous. The main reason why this writer has chosen the Island of Palmas case, the Minquiers - Ecrehos case, Hawar Case, Ligitan and Sipadan Case and Pedra Branca Case is because these arguments from the cases {{can be applied to the}} settlement of the territorial dispute over Dokdo between South Korea and Japan. The issues from these cases would be the key to solve the Dokdo problem between South Korea and Japan. In relation to the Dokdo problem, South Korea and Japan claim both their original and historic title to Dokdo on the basis of <b>effective</b> <b>possession</b> over the islands. South Korea claims that Dokdo has been an integral part of Korean territory since AD 512 when the ancient Korean Kingdom Silla (57 BC 竊? 935 AD) annexed Usanguk, a small country consisting of Ulleung-do (Ulleung Island) and its surrounding islands, including Dokdo. They claim Dokdo has been part of Ulleung-do and they have always maintained it and never surrendered it. On the other hand, Japan claims that Dokdo as an inherent part of their territory, and they deny Korean history since AD 512. The Japanese government claims that they used Dokdo as a stopover port en route to Ulleung-do and as a fishing ground since mid 17 th century. They also insist that they incorporated Dokdo into Shimane Prefecture in 1905. However, their claim about the incorporation is unreasonable. According to their claim, Dokdo was incorporated into Shimane Prefecture by the Shimane Prefectural Notice No. 40 in 22 nd February 1905, and they notified to the governor of Ulleung-do, Sim Heung-taek in the following year, 28 th February 1906. At that time, Korea could not protest against the Japanese notice effectively, because Japan had already claimed the diplomatic sovereignty of Korea via the Eulsa Treaty in 17 th November 1905. This is also known as the Eulsa Protectorate Treaty or the Second Japan-Korea Agreement, and it was influenced by the result of the Russo竊욵apanese War (1904 - 1905). The war prompted by Japanese imperialistic invasion scheme toward Northeast Asia. The ratification of the Eulsa treaty was compelled by Japan, with signatures given by neither the King nor the Prime Minister of Korea. Therefore, the annexation of Dokdo by Japan was no legal validity under international law. On 3 rd January 2009, a Korean lawyer, Choi Bong-tae found that in the Japanese government document Japan excluded Dokdo from their territory. Japanese Prime Ministerial Ordinance No. 24 issued on 6 th June 1951 stated that the Japanese territory was Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and nearby islands and excluded Jeju-do, Ulleung-do and Dokdo. The ordinance shows that Japan did not have the authority to exercise property right over Dokdo because it recognised it belonged to Korea. This is the conclusive proof of the possession of Korea over the Dokdo. The two issues, the Shimane Prefectural Notice No. 40 and Japanese Prime Ministerial Ordinance No. 24, are good examples of probative evidence relating to the sovereignty of island. In the Minquiers - Ecrehos case, the International Court of Justice stressed the importance of the direct evidence of <b>effective</b> <b>possession</b> rather than the indirect presumptions deduced from events in the Middle Ages. As stated above, the principle of <b>effective</b> <b>possession</b> is the most important criterion concerning the solution of territorial disputes. For this reason, South Korea and Japan claim their title based upon the principle of <b>effective</b> <b>possession.</b> However, this should not be applied to all territorial disputes without distinguishing different situations. It is a dangerous attitude to adopt a certain international legal theory to particular cases without considering the specific situations of the disputed area. Hence, the writer will analyse common and differing features between above cases and the Dokdo problem. In addition, consideration will be given to which arguments from above cases can be applied to the Dokdo problem. There are many differing features between above cases and the Dokdo problem such as geographical, historical and political situations. Consequently, this thesis will confirm the importance of the criteria for the decision of International Court as a standard for the settlement of maritime territorial disputes between countries. &# 30446143 &# 29563133 &# 21443 &# 32080 &# 320046 &# 51109131 &# 51228130 &# 8545130 &# 8544128 &# 31532 Critical Date	 126 &# 8545 Critical Date	 126 &# 8544123 &# 31532114 &# 8545111 &# 8544108 &# 31532107 &# 854540 &# 34399 &# 31532 &# 21578 &# 32291 &# 45348 &# 498841905 &# 24180107 &# 8544103 &# 31532. &# 22283100 &# 8545 &# 27665 &# 38867. &# 22823100 &# 854499 &# 31532 &# 21766 &# 310345 &# 5110997 &# 5122895 &# 8546 &# 22659 &# 38291 &# 47568 &# 49548 &# 45208 &# 53412. 1986 &# 2418094 &# 8545 &# 23546 &# 50612 &# 54756 &# 48708 &# 50500 &# 54532. 1962 &# 2418093 &# 8544 &# 4428891 &# 3153289 &# 854686 &# 854586 &# 8544 Critical Date&# 5064076 &# 31532 &# 51648 &# 50864, &# 49324 &# 46973 &# 46308, &# 48120 &# 52852 &# 46993 &# 48652 &# 46972 &# 54168. 2008 &# 2418066 &# 8546 &# 47476 &# 54616. 2001 &# 2418062 &# 854562 &# 854461 &# 31532 &# 46300 &# 46976 &# 47536 &# 44536 &# 48512 &# 46041. 1933 &# 2418058 &# 8546 &# 53948 &# 54140 &# 53364. 1931 &# 2418057 &# 854556 &# 854448 &# 31532 &# 45800 &# 54028 -&# 49884 &# 53444 &# 44592 &# 47532. 2002 &# 2418042 &# 8546 &# 50724 &# 47112 &# 45132 -&# 50640 &# 45180 &# 47581. 1953 &# 2418039 &# 8545 &# 20107 &# 49452 &# 49828 &# 47560 &# 54036. 1928 &# 2418038 &# 854438 &# 31532 &# 27770 &# 38498 &# 38364 &# 26377 &# 639244 &# 3145636 &# 3153236 &# 854635 &# 854534 &# 8544 &# 21147 &# 25818 &# 35657 &# 222945 &# 3168033 &# 3153232 &# 8545 Critical Date	 32 &# 85444 &# 3168031 &# 3153230 &# 854629 &# 854529 &# 8544 &# 21407 &# 27402 &# 21490 &# 6388429 &# 3153227 &# 854627 &# 854527 &# 8544 &# 63972 &# 21344 &# 2080825 &# 31532 &# 26524. &# 2592822 &# 8546 &# 20214. &# 3520120 &# 8545 &# 32681. &# 2484720 &# 8544 &# 37197 &# 25903 &# 25928 &# 2352620 &# 31532 &# 40670 &# 352013 &# 3145619 &# 31532 &# 26412. &# 2608517 &# 8545. &# 3886717 &# 8544 &# 24373 &# 20027 &# 63864 &# 54620 &# 45824 &# 506403 &# 3168014 &# 31532 &# 21028 &# 3500911 &# 8545 &# 29229 &# 32027 &# 38555 &# 50752. &# 2954411 &# 8544 &# 21619 &# 2484710 &# 31532 &# 34907 &# 38450 &# 22303 &# 22283 &# 26989. &# 284179 &# 8545 &# 20418 &# 24907 &# 29983. &# 223209 &# 8544 &# 27841 &# 29694 &# 29702 &# 22320 &# 25991 &# 201549 &# 31532 &# 23519 &# 32771 &# 33324 &# 19968 &# 51032 &# 38988 &# 21839 &# 23798 &# 295442 &# 314566 &# 31532 &# 27861 &# 26041 &# 22285 &# 316842 &# 31680 &# 30340 &# 48143 &# 26223 &# 32972 &# 31350 &# 307991 &# 316801 &# 31532 &# 35542 &# 242071 &# 31456 Abstract &# 31532 &# 2742...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Knowledge {{management}} {{is one of}} the strategies designed to tackle various challenges which modern tertiary institutions are facing. Tertiary institutions are no longer expected to live and operate in isolation. This paper examined knowledge management and creativity elements expected of lecturers in Nigerian universities. A total of 200 lecturers from two government owned universities randomly drawn, participated in the study. Three research questions guided the study to reveal knowledge management creativity competencies of university lecturers in Anambra State of Nigeria. A four-point Likert type scale questionnaire of 34 - items was used for data collection. Frequency distribution table and mean were used for analysis of the research questions. The instrument was validated by two experts in Education Management, while split-half reliability coefficient values of 0. 85, 0. 80 and 0. 90 were determined. Findings revealed 13 - knowledge management creativity elements expected of lecturers for successful performance of their duties; low level application of these knowledge management creativity elements and 13 strategies for <b>effective</b> <b>possession</b> and applications of the enumerated competencies. Recommendations included: Knowledge and Learning Managers should be made available to universities and lecturers by university stakeholders. This will provide tools for creativity competencies development, delivery, reporting and management of training/learning materials. Knowledge management creativity competence related workshops should be organized regularly for these lecturers to enable them develop these skills so as to inculcate same in their student...|$|E
40|$|In the new South Africa, {{the promise}} of land {{restitution}} raised millennial-style expectations amongst dispossessed and dispersed former landholders. Partly prompted by emerging policy discourses, iconic tropes of localised cultural experience such as grave sites, initiation lodges and cattle byres have acquired new significance: they became verifiable evidence of <b>effective</b> <b>possession</b> of – because proving what the Land Claims Commission calls ‘informal rights’ in – land. They thus became grounds {{on the basis of}} which to claim the restoration of such land. The meaning of land, the nature of ownership, and the legitimacy of its restoration, were all matters contested between claimants and policy makers/human rights lawyers. They were also contested by those at different levels in the hierarchical social order of the new South Africa. Members of the African nationalist political elite, in dialogue with lawyers, cherished one set of understandings while ordinary migrant/country-dwellers tended to hold to another. Both, however, were mediated through the new discourse on informal rights. It is neither purely through the activities of cosmopolitan elites with their ‘political demand for land’ nor through the unmediated localist experience of less sophisticated country-dwellers with more practical orientations that the significance of land becomes evident, but in the interaction between the two. Based on local understandings, transformed in the course of thirty years of ‘land back’ struggles, and finally negotiated {{over the course of the}} last ten years, a new diasporic consensus on what ‘the land’ signifies has been established...|$|E
