500|$|... "Bad Romance" [...] is an electropop and dance-pop {{song with}} house, new wave and techno influences. According to the sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a metronome of 119 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A minor, with Gaga's vocal range spanning from the low-note of E3 to the high-note of C5. The song follows in the chord progression of Am–C–F–C–G in the verses and F–G–Am–C–F–G–E–Am in the chorus. The song opens with Gaga singing {{a portion of the}} chorus, then transitioning into the [...] "Rah-rah--ah-ah-ah, Roma-roma-ma, Gaga-ooh-la-la" [...] hook, which—according to an interview Gaga gave for the Carpool Karaoke segment of The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2016—is an abbreviation of the word [...] "romance". It is followed by the sound of drum beats and keyboards. After the first verse, the pre-chorus follows, with Gaga voicing the lines, [...] "You know that I want you, And you know that I need you, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> bad, your bad romance". The full-throated chorus then follows, where she sings, [...] "I want your love, And <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> revenge, You and me could write a bad romance ... Caught in a bad romance".|$|E

[...] Wyatt said Virgil told the Cowboys, [...] "Throw up your hands; I {{have come to}} disarm you!" [...] Virgil and Wyatt both testified they saw Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton draw and cock their six-shooters. Virgil yelled: [...] "Hold! I don't mean that!" [...] or [...] "Hold on, I don't want that!" [...] The single-action revolvers carried by both groups had to be cocked before firing.|$|E

5000|$|Likewise a {{story is}} told of how in moments of mystical rapture, Schneur Zalman of Liadi would be seen rolling on the floor, exclaiming [...] "God, <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>your</b> Garden of Eden (Heavenly World), <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>your</b> World-to-Come (Messianic days), <b>I</b> just <b>want</b> You!".|$|R

500|$|Gil Kaufman from MTV News found {{similarities}} between the tempo of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and that of Gaga's previous single [...] "Poker Face". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noticed the 1980s influences that resonate throughout the track: [...] "If melodies could be time-stamped, these would have '80s' branded on their asses." [...] Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix pinpointed not only the declarations of liberation [...] "from a significant other", but the Depeche Mode and Madonna-esque qualities that permeate [...] "Bad Romance". To Pitchfork Media journalist Scott Plagenhoef, Gaga was able to transform her persona to reflect various female entertainers of similar vein, often reminiscent of the likes of Britney Spears, Madonna and Amy Winehouse. Simon Price from The Independent heard characteristics of Boney M in the chorus, and stated that {{the first line of}} the song, [...] "I want your ugly, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> disease", established the grim tone of The Fame Monster.|$|E
500|$|... "The Queen and I" [...] {{features}} extensive {{samples from}} ABBA's [...] "Dancing Queen", often overlain with a rasping detuned accompaniment. These lead into Drummond's satirical and discontent rapping, a fictional {{account of his}} march into the British House of Commons and Buckingham Palace to demand answers. The song also protests the involvement of cigarette companies in sport ("When cancer is the killer/John Player run the league") and lambasts the [...] "tabloid mentality" [...] ("They all keep talking about Princess Di's dress"). The Sex Pistols' [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] is briefly sampled. After nearly three minutes of samples from the television show Top of the Pops, as well as sound clips from programmes and advertisements on other TV channels, Drummond cries [...] "Fuck that, let's have The JAMs!". The acerbic [...] "All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)" [...] follows. A [...] "stunning audio collage" [...] featuring an AIDS public information film, a rerecording of glamour model Samantha Fox's [...] "Touch Me (<b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Your</b> Body)", and the nursery rhyme [...] "Ring a Ring o' Roses", [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] comments on sex and the British media's reaction to the AIDS crisis.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the song}} was {{released}} as a limited edition one-sided white label promotional 12", on 9 March 1987, by The JAMs' own label The Sound Of Mu(sic). This version included a 15-second sample of The Beatles' [...] "All You Need Is Love", as well as samples of the MC5's [...] "Kick Out the Jams" [...] and Samantha Fox's [...] "Touch Me (<b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Your</b> Body)". [...] The song had been declined by distributors fearful of prosecution, but copies of the white label were sent to DJs and the music press. [...] The identities of Drummond and Cauty were not made known to these recipients (Drummond was actually something of a music business veteran, and Cauty {{a former member of}} the much-hyped but unsuccessful band Brilliant). Underground Magazine speculated on this in March 1987: [...] "The whole affair is mysterious, a telephone number only and a threat that the group will soon be releasing more material... 'No, we've not been in bands before, and yes, I suppose we were originally influenced by the Beastie Boys to actually get up and do something...' Too true, but these colonials seem a touch wiser, world weary a bit, but not angry...". In the 28 March 1987 edition, NME revealed King Boy D's [...] identity as Bill Drummond.|$|E

500|$|Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone {{commented that}} the song [...] "recalls the synth-gloom {{ambience}} of Britney's 2007 gem, Blackout." [...] He also compared the riff to AC/DC's [...] "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" [...] (1976). The hook was noted by Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times to be reminiscent of [...] "(I Just) Died in Your Arms" [...] (1986) by Cutting Crew. Nick Levine of Digital Spy felt the song had a [...] "clubby and au courant" [...] feel, comparable to [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] (2010) by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing Inc., [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] {{is set in the}} compound meter time signature, with a moderate dance beat infused metronome of 133 beats per minute. Lyrically, [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] talks about seducing someone on the dancefloor. The chorus revolves around pick-up lines; Spears sings, [...] "If I said <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> body now, would you hold it against me?" [...] and [...] "'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight." [...] James Montgomery of MTV compared the feeling of the lyrics to that of [...] "If U Seek Amy" [...] (2009).|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, she {{launched}} her pop music career with her debut single [...] "Touch Me (<b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Your</b> Body)", which peaked at number-one in 17 countries.

Henslow took on the plants, and Darwin was given introductions to the best London naturalists with a warning that they would already be busy with other work.|$|E

He further penned the b-sides for Fox's singles [...] "Do Ya Do Ya (Wanna Please Me)" [...] and [...] "Touch Me (<b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Your</b> Body)"; the songs were titled [...] "Drop Me A Line" [...] and [...] "Never Fall in Love Again" [...] respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Virgil, his {{brothers}} Wyatt and Morgan, and Doc Holliday confronted the Cowboys {{in a narrow}} lot on Fremont Street. Virgil was not expecting a fight. He later testified that {{when he saw the}} Cowboys, he immediately commanded them to [...] "Throw up your hands, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> guns!" [...] But general shooting broke out almost immediately. Witnesses were conflicted about who fired first. During the gunfight, Billy Clanton and both McLaury brothers were killed. Virgil was shot through the calf (he thought by Billy Clanton). Three days after the O.K. Corral gunfight, the city council suspended Virgil as city marshal pending outcome of the preliminary hearing. Virgil was eventually exonerated of wrongdoing, but his reputation suffered thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|The JAMs' debut studio single [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] {{dealt with}} the media {{coverage}} given to AIDS, sampling heavily from the Beatles' [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] and Samantha Fox's [...] "Touch Me (<b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Your</b> Body)". Although it was declined by distributors fearful of prosecution, and threatened with lawsuits, copies of the one-sided white label 12" [...] {{were sent to the}} music press; it received positive reviews and was made [...] "single of the week" [...] in Sounds. A later piece in the same magazine called the JAMs [...] "the hottest, most exhilarating band this year....

2500|$|Music writers noted electropop and dance-pop styles on Femme Fatale. Music {{journalist}} Jody Rosen {{wrote of}} the album, [...] "Conceptually it's straightforward: a party record packed with sex and sadness". The album was compared to Spears's previous albums, In the Zone (2003), Blackout (2007) and Circus (2008). Although Spears was criticized for her lack of involvement from the album's production and writing, she wrote the song [...] "Scary", produced by Fraser T Smith, which was included on the Japanese deluxe edition of the album. The album opens with [...] "Till the World Ends", co-written by Kesha, was described as an uptempo dance-pop and electropop song, with an electro beat and elements of trance and Eurodance. The song opens with sirens and a [...] "sizzling" [...] bassline. Critics complimented the song's [...] "anthemic nature" [...] and [...] "chant-like chorus". The second track and lead single [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] is a dance-pop song which features industrial beats, a dubstep-influenced breakdown and employing elements of grime and a final chorus with elements of rave. The lyrics portray the singer seducing someone on the dancefloor, while the chorus revolves around pick-up lines, with Spears singing: [...] "If I said <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> body now, would you hold it against me?" [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Spears were complimented by Rick Florino of Artistdirect for [...] "stepping into new territory and pushing the boundaries of dance-pop once more." ...|$|E
