25|$|Both the Christian Democrats and the Liberals openly {{supported}} a three-party coalition with Solberg as Prime Minister. A new Christian DemocratLiberalConservative {{government would have}} avoided the need for support from the Progress Party, by leaving the <b>draft</b> <b>budget</b> from the Red-Green Coalition unchanged. This budget would then pass {{with support from the}} Red-Greens and the new non-socialist government. Further issues could then be postponed until 2010 and be handled individually. The Progress Party had promised to vote for measures with which they agree, and the Red-Green parties were expected to do the same. By the start of September, the Progress Party had lost 4.9% of its public support, and many believed that this was due to their One Hundred Day Plan. Meanwhile, the Conservative party gained 3.7%, many of whom were former Progress Party supporters.|$|E
25|$|The SPD’s last {{period in}} office was arguably a failure, due to both {{its lack of}} a {{parliamentary}} majority (which forced it to make compromises to right-wing parties) and its inability to confront the Great Depression. In 1927, the defence ministry had prevailed on the government of Wilhelm Marx to provide funds in its <b>draft</b> <b>budget</b> of 1928 {{for the construction of}} the first of six small battleships allowed for under the treaty of Versailles, although the Federal Council (largely for financial reasons) stopped this action. This issue played a major role during the 1928 election campaign, with supporters of the proposal arguing that all the possibilities left for German armaments should be fully used, while the SPD and the KPD saw this as a wasteful expenditure, arguing that such money should instead be spent on providing free meals for schoolchildren. The SPD’s lack of a parliamentary majority (which prevented it from undertaking any major domestic reform) meant that, in order to hold the coalition together, Hermann Müller and the other SPD ministers were forced to make concessions on issues such as taxation, unemployment insurance, and the construction of pocket battleships.|$|E
2500|$|While the Great Council {{gathered}} to adjudicate on the agricultural budget, {{inspired by the}} recommendation of the Tardi committee, Bourguiba sent out a [...] "supreme warning", writing: [...] "We will be particularly inexorable against the last-minute setbacks or interested jilting." [...] His arrogance with the protectorate, and his determination to stand up to Chenik, was found to be impressive. When the <b>draft</b> <b>budget</b> favorable to French interests against which Chenik pronounced an indictment was rejected by the Great Council, Bourguiba wrote that: [...] "The Tunisian people will remember that the delegates of the Jewish community were interested in the fate of our fellahs (farmers) much more than certain Muslim agricultural delegates of Center and South. The Tunisia we intend to free will not be a Tunisia for Muslims, for Jewish or for Christians. It will be the Tunisia of all those who, without distinction of religion or race, would like to accredit for their country and live under the protection of equal laws." [...] This statement will gradually become his doctrine, both modernist and secular.|$|E
