5|$|Warfarin has {{traditionally}} been used to kill rodents, but many populations have developed resistance to this anticoagulant, and <b>difenacoum</b> is often substituted. These are cumulative poisons, requiring bait stations to be topped up regularly. Poisoned meat {{has been used for}} centuries to kill animals such as wolves and birds of prey. Poisoned carcasses however kill a wide range of carrion feeders, not only the targeted species. Raptors in Israel were nearly wiped out following a period of intense poisoning of rats and other crop pests.|$|E
50|$|<b>Difenacoum</b> {{has been}} shown to be highly toxic to some species of {{freshwater}} fish and green algae despite the fact that <b>difenacoum</b> is weakly soluble in aqueous solutions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Difenacoum</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1976 as a rodenticide effective against rats and mice which were resistant to other anticoagulants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Difenacoum</b> is an {{anticoagulant}} of the 4-hydroxycoumarin vitamin K antagonist type. It has anticoagulant {{effects and}} is used commercially as a rodenticide. It was first introduced in 1976 and first registered in the USA in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Because {{other species}} of mammals and birds may prey upon {{affected}} rodents, or directly ingest rodenticide bait, {{there is a risk}} of primary, secondary or tertiary exposure; examples are described in a 2012 publication on veterinary toxicology.Using radiolabeled isotopes, <b>difenacoum</b> (and/or its metabolites) {{has been shown to be}} distributed across many organ tissues upon oral ingestion, with the highest concentrations occurring in the liver and pancreas.|$|E
50|$|The first {{application}} of a calciferol in rodenticidal bait was in the Sorex product Sorexa D (with a different formula than today's Sorexa D), {{back in the early}} 1970s, which contained 0.025% warfarin and 0.1% ergocalciferol. Today, Sorexa CD contains a 0.0025% <b>difenacoum</b> and 0.075% cholecalciferol combination. Numerous other brand products containing either 0.075-0.1% calciferols (e.g. Quintox) alone or alongside an anticoagulant are marketed.|$|E
40|$|<b>Difenacoum,</b> an {{antivitamin}} K anticoagulant, {{has been}} widely used as rodenticide to manage populations of rodents. <b>Difenacoum</b> belongs to the second generation of anticoagulant, and, as all the molecules belonging to the second generation of anticoagulant, <b>difenacoum</b> is often involved in primary poisonings of domestic animals and secondary poisonings of wildlife by feeding contaminated rodents. To develop a new and ecofriendly <b>difenacoum,</b> we explored in this study the differences in properties between diastereomers of <b>difenacoum.</b> Indeed, the currently commercial <b>difenacoum</b> {{is a mixture of}} 57 % of cis-isomers and 43 % of transisomers. Cis- and trans-isomers were thus purified on a C 18 column, and their respective pharmacokinetic properties and their efficiency to inhibit the coagulation of rodents were explored. Tissue persistence of trans-isomers was shown to be shorter than that of cis-isomers with a half-life fivefold shorter. Efficiency to inhibit the vitamin K epoxide reductase activity involved in the coagulation process was shown to be similar between cis- and trans-isomers. The use of trans-isomers of <b>difenacoum</b> allowed to drastically reduce <b>difenacoum</b> residues in liver and other tissues of rodents when the rodent is moribund. Therefore, secondary poisonings of wildlife should be decreased by the use of <b>difenacoum</b> largely enriched in trans-isomers...|$|E
40|$|<b>Difenacoum</b> {{is a new}} {{rodenticide}} {{recently introduced}} on the British market; {{it is one of}} the most potent of a series of hydroxycoumarin-based anticoagulants. <b>Difenacoum</b> is effective against laboratory rats and mice resistant to conventional anticoagulants and has a marked selectivity in favor of non-target species. Vitamin K 1 is an effective antidote and the hazard of secondary poisoning is minimal. Laboratory and field trials confirm <b>difenacoum</b> 2 ̆ 7 s efficacy against wild resistant strains. Further work is in progress to evaluate the efficacy of <b>difenacoum</b> against other rodent pest species...|$|E
40|$|Feeding {{tests were}} {{carried out in the}} {{laboratory}} to obtain basic data on the susceptibility of wild Norway rats to <b>difenacoum.</b> The results were used to derive a standard test procedure for the identification of <b>difenacoum</b> resistance in warfarin-susceptible and resistant rats.

40|$|The {{baseline}} susceptibility of {{the lesser}} bandicoot rat, Bandicota bengalensis, from Rangoon, Burma, to five anticoagulant rodenticides was established with no-choice feeding in the laboratory. The susceptibility of lesser bandicoots to the several poisons (brodifacoum, <b>difenacoum,</b> diphacinone, coumatetralyl, and warfarin) {{was such that}} they were offered at a 0. 001 % concentration. B. bengalensis was most susceptible to brodifacoum, and in descending order, <b>difenacoum,</b> coumatetralyl, diphacinone and warfarin. In comparison with Rattus norvegicus on warfarin at 0. 005 %, B. bengalensis proved more susceptible. Feeding tests at 0. 005 % concentration indicated that a 1 -day feeding on brodifacoum and <b>difenacoum</b> would result in complete mortality, whereas coumatetralyl and warfarin would require 4 days feeding to a 100 % kill. Brodifacoum and <b>difenacoum</b> are recommended at 0. 002 - 0. 005 % bait concentrations and coumatetralyl at 0. 005 [...] 0. 01 % concentrations for the control of B. bengalensis {{in the field in}} Rangoon. The use of any anticoagulant material in rat control should be alternated with acute toxicants to retard the possible development of anticoagulant resistance...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} and pharmacodynamics of the 4 -hydroxycoumarin anticoagulants, brodifacoum, <b>difenacoum,</b> and warfarin {{have been}} studied in the rabbit. Sensitive (50 ng ml- 1) and specific high performance liquid chromatography assays {{have been developed for}} the determination of plasma concentrations of warfarin, brodifacoum and <b>difenacoum.</b> After administration of a single intravenous dose (20 mumol kg- 1), plasma concentrations of warfarin underwent mono-exponential decay, with a terminal half-life of 5. 6 +/- 0. 7 h (mean +/- s. e. mean), whereas plasma concentrations of brodifacoum and <b>difenacoum</b> underwent bi-exponential decay with terminal half-lives of 60. 8 +/- 1. 9 h and 83. 1 +/- 10. 3 h respectively. The plasma half-life of brodifacoum in a single patient poisoned with the compound was 487 h. The pharmacological response to the anticoagulants was measured as changes in prothrombin complex activity, from which the rate of clotting factor synthesis was determined. Clotting factor synthesis recovered in a monophasic fashion after a single intravenous dose of warfarin, compared with a more complex biphasic, pattern of recovery of clotting factor synthesis after administration of either brodifacoum or <b>difenacoum.</b> The slope (m) of the intensity of effect-log (amount of drug in the body) curve was derived for each anticoagulant. There {{was no significant difference in}} the value of m after single intravenous doses of racemic, R-, and S-warfarin, <b>difenacoum</b> and brodifacoum, which is consistent with the hypothesis that all the 4 -hydroxycoumarin anticoagulants produce their anticoagulant effect by acting at the same receptor site, vitamin K epoxide reductase. Determination of the minimum plasma concentration of each anticoagulant that corresponded with the complete inhibition of clotting factor synthesis indicated that racemic warfarin, R-warfarin and brodifacoum have similar potencies in the rabbit and are less potent than S-warfarin and <b>difenacoum...</b>|$|E
40|$|A reversed-phase {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic {{method was}} developed {{for the analysis of}} eight anticoagulant rodenticides in animal liver. Coumarinic anticoagulant rodenticides (brodifacoum, bromadiolone, coumachlor, coumatetralyl, <b>difenacoum,</b> and warfarin) were detected by using a gradient elution and a fluorimetric detection. Indanedione anticoagulant rodenticides (chlorophacinone and diphacinone) were detected by using an isocratic elution and an UV detection. Anticoagulants were extracted from liver with mixtures of acetone/diethylether and acetone/chloroform. Extracts were applied to solid-phase extraction cartridges. Linearity was checked over the concentration range 0. 1 - 0. 6 pg/g. Relative standard deviations of within-run and between-run variability were all between 5. 7 and 10. 3 %. Recoveries from spiked liver samples were between 51. 7 (<b>difenacoum)</b> and 78. 2 % (warfarin). Limits of detection were between 0. 01 (<b>difenacoum</b> and warfarin) and 0. 11 pg/g (chlorophacinone) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>difenacoum</b> {{as a new}} anticoagulant rodenticide was evaluated by blood coagulation studies and laboratory feeding tests using warfarin-resistant and non-resistant common rats (Rattus norvegicus), ship rats (R. rattus) and house mice (Mus musculus). Prothrombin assays indicated that the compound had as marked an activity with warfarin-resistant common rats as coumatetralyl had with non-resistant animals. Feeding tests confirmed that 0 - 005 % would be a near-optimal concentration for field use, although there was some evidence of unpalatability. Results with ship rats and house mice were less favourable. Trials with enclosed colonies of warfarin-resistant mice confirmed the laboratory finding that although <b>difenacoum</b> was more effective than all other currently used anticoagulants, it was unlikely to give complete control. It is concluded that <b>difenacoum</b> is a valuable new rodenticide, especiaaly for controlling warfarin-resistant common rats...|$|E
40|$|The {{anticoagulant}} <b>difenacoum</b> {{was tested}} at two concentrations, 0 - 005 and 0 - 01 %, in bait against warfarin-resistant rat infestations in farm buildings. Twelve {{out of the}} 14 treatments in which the lower concentration of the anticoagulant was used resulted in complete control. One of the remaining two treatments was probably also completely successful, but in the other a few rats, that were not eating the poisoned baits, were still active after 30 days of baiting. All six treatments done using the stronger concentration of poison were completely effective. Since it took as long to control infestations with 0. 01 % as with 0. 005 % <b>difenacoum</b> in treatments carried out under similar conditions, the lower concentration is recommended for use against warfarin-resistant rats...|$|E
40|$|Three South-Asian rodent past {{species were}} tested for {{susceptibility}} to anticoagulant rodenticides. Wheat fluor containing 0 - 025 % warfarin 0 - 0375 % coumatetralyl or 0 - 005 % <b>difenacoum</b> was fed to 260 Tatera indica, 140 Nesokia indica and 81 Bandicota bengalensis for 1 - 56 days. Tatera {{was about as}} susceptible to anticoagulants as Rattus {{has been reported to}} be. Nesokia and Bandicota were extremely variable: though the majority were highly susceptible, the slopes of the dose-mortality curves were close to zero. The <b>difenacoum</b> diet appeared to be more toxic than the warfarin diet to all three species, but less toxic than the coumatetralyl diet to Tatera and Nesokia.

40|$|Laboratory {{and field}} trials were {{conducted}} to determine {{the efficacy of the}} anticoagulant rodenticide bromadiolone against the house mouse (Mus musculus). In laboratory feeding tests, family groups of warfarin-resistant mice maintained in pens and conditioned to feeding on plain foods were offered pinhead oatmeal bait containing bromadiolone at 0. 005 %. Overall mortality in replicated 21 -day poison treatments was 55 / 58 or 94. 8 %. Six field trials were carried out, using the same poison bait, against mice infesting farm buildings. Treatment success, estimated from the results of census baitings conducted before and after treatment, ranged between 60. 4 % and 100 %, mean 92. 4 %. In equivalent field trials using <b>difenacoum,</b> another newly developed anticoagulant rodenticide, the control achieved ranged between 70. 2 % and 100 %, mean 96. 0 %. Five field trials, three involving bromadiolone and two <b>difenacoum,</b> were not completely successful and the surviving mice were removed for laboratory examination. In 21 -day toxicity tests, each animal was fed the poison bait offered to it earlier in the field. Bromadiolone and <b>difenacoum</b> gave kills of 12 / 21 (57. 1 %) and 9 / 11 (81. 8 %) respectively.

40|$|Trials of {{rodenticidal baits}} {{containing}} 50 p. p. m. <b>difenacoum,</b> 50 p. p. m. bromadiolone or 20 p. p. m. brodifacoum {{were carried out}} on farmsteads against populations of Rattus norvegicus containing difenacoum-resistant individuals. Six <b>difenacoum</b> treatments failed in 14 [...] 42 days of baiting. Two treatments with bromadiolone succeeded in 23 and 33 days, but four further treatments lasting 35 [...] 56 days failed to eradicate the populations.

The performance of both bromadiolone and brodifacoum was well below that reported by previous investigators, indicating the possibility of low-grade resistance to these compounds in the difenacoum-resistant strain...|$|E
40|$|The case {{histories}} of two patients {{exposed to the}} novel anticoagulants brodifacoum and <b>difenacoum</b> are reported. Abnormal vitamin K 1 metabolism, as indicated by elevated vitamin K 1 2, 3 -epoxide plasma concentrations after i. v. administration of vitamin K 1, could be detected for more than 18 months after exposure to the anticoagulants. There was a marked prolongation of prothrombin time (greater than 50 s) in both cases, {{at the time of}} exposure. However, subsequent haematological investigations (prothrombin time and vitamin K-dependent clotting factor activity) {{have been shown to be}} normal in both cases for at least 18 months.

40|$|The second-generation anticoagulants, <b>difenacoum,</b> bromadiolone and brodifacoum, {{have taken}} over a {{considerable}} part of the rodenticidal market during the last six to eight years.

Resistance of practical importance has, however, now been encountered to <b>difenacoum</b> and bromadiolone in Europe, i. e., UK and Scandinavia. Brodifacoum, in spite of the evidence of a somewhat increased tolerance in some commensal rodent populations, still must be considered a highly effective rodenticide against almost all important rodent pest species. Research leading to the synthesis of similar potent anticoagulant molecules or other slow-acting rodenticides should be encouraged in order to cope with the possible development of resistance also to brodifacoum in the future...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of the newly developed anticoagulant rodenticide WBA 8119 was evaluated against the house mouse (Mus musculus L.) using individual and family groups of warfarin-resistant animals. WBA 8119 at 0 - 002 %, 0 - 005 % and 0 - 01 % in pinhead oatmeal bait gave complete kills of mice in 'no-choice' feeding tests carried out in cages and small pens. In replicated 21 -day treatments on families of mice confined in larger pens conditioned to feeding on plain foods, the overall mortalities obtained using the three formulated poison baits were 71 / 72, 62 / 63 and 57 / 57 respectively. The results of the WBA 8119 toxicity tests are considered in relation to previous findings on other anticoagulant rodenticides, particularly <b>difenacoum.</b> In equivalents tests, WBA 8119 performed better than <b>difenacoum.</b> The data thus suport the laboratory findings that WBA 8119 is the most active anticoagulant so far tested for the control of warfarin-resistant house mice...|$|E
40|$|House mice (Mus musculus domesticus) vary {{considerably}} in their susceptibility to anticoagulants, and several non-synonymous sequence variants in the coding {{region of the}} vitamin K epoxide reductase subcomponent 1 gene (vkorc 1) were found in Germany (Rost et al., 2009). It was the aim of our study to characterize the degree of resistance in relation to vkorc 1 genotypes in local mouse groups, and to test whether certain genotypes were selected by sequential treatments with the two anticoagulant rodenticides warfarin and <b>difenacoum.</b> Two successive treatments were conducted, the first with bait containing warfarin followed by a second using <b>difenacoum.</b> Their effects were determined on local sub-groups of mouse infestations in different sub-units on two livestock farms in Westphalia, Germany. The frequency of different vkorc 1 genotypes, as determined by Sanger sequencing, was considered relative to the rodenticide treatment results for each sub-group and sampling period. Three tolerance types were identified on farm one: A=warfarin-susceptible, B=resistant to warfarin, but susceptible to <b>difenacoum,</b> C=approx. one half of animals resistant to both anticoagulants. On farm 2, only type A and B were identified. A high degree of resistance was observed in vkorc 1 wild-type mice. In all cases, only the R 58 G vkorc 1 variant was found, which appears {{not to be a}} resistance marker in house mice. Hence, in these mouse infestations, practical resistance to anticoagulants was not accompanied by any identifiable vkorc 1 resistance marker.

40|$|The {{exposure}} of {{primary and secondary}} non-target species to Second Generation Anticoagulant Rodenticides (SGARs) is widespread and is {{a cause for concern}} amongst conservationists. Levels found in wild non-target species range from trace amounts to lethal levels and occur in up to 81 % of barn owl carcasses surveyed. The harm caused by low level AR residues carried by many animals in the wild is not well understood, as is the relative toxicity of the different AR compounds to bird species. My experimental work investigated both sub-lethal residues carried by laboratory mice, Mus musculus, and the comparative toxicity of three SGARs (bromadiolone, <b>difenacoum</b> and brodifacoum) to feral pigeon, Columba livia. Laboratory mice were given >LDso doses of three SGAR compounds and were maintained initially with vitamin K supplements. These mice were monitored for 175 days post-dosing, including through pregnancy. No measurable effect of carrying a SGAR-residue was seen on the growth and breeding activity of mice. Using blood-clotting response testing in pigeons, an EDso was determined for SGAR compounds. Bromadiolone was the least toxic compound to pigeons while the toxicity of <b>difenacoum</b> did not differ significantly from brodifacoum. Data from field trials conducted against AR-resistant rat populations was modelled to compare the exposure levels posed by three SGAR compounds used to control the wild rat infestations. The model was in two parts, the uptake and persistence in the rat population, and the secondary exposure posed by the trials. The AR-resistant rat populations were not controlled completely by bromadiolone or <b>difenacoum</b> and this resulted in much higher levels of SGAR entering the food chain through the rats. This in turn led to higher exposure levels in the secondary non-target species. The need for understanding the toxicity level of each compound to the non-target species of concern was highlighted by this work. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Between 1988 and 1995 {{populations of}} rats on {{agricultural}} premises were sampled {{to investigate the}} distribution of anticoagulant-resistant rats in England and Wales. In total, approximately 1, 670 rats from 115 locations were tested for resistance to warfarin. Rats that were warfarin-resistant were subsequently tested for resistance to <b>difenacoum,</b> and since 1991 for resistance to bromadiolone. In some cases rats were also tested for resistance to brodifacoum, and in 1995 for resistance to flocoumafen. The results of these tests showed {{that there was a}} high prevalence of resistance to the first-generation anticoagulant, warfarin, in several regions of England and Wales. Rats from most populations sampled since 1991 appeared to be more resistant to bromadiolone than <b>difenacoum,</b> but in central southern England there were some populations where the reverse was true. In this same part of the country there was a relatively small focus where the rats had high degrees of resistance to several anticoagulant rodenticides.

I determined environmentally realistic doses of two SGARs, brodifacoum (high acute toxicity) and <b>difenacoum</b> (most widely used and detected in wildlife), in a model species, Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica), and used these doses in subsequent studies. Anticoagulation profiles and liver residues associated with the doses were characterised. Unexpectedly, one dose (0. 4 mg kg- 1 body weight brodifacoum) induced persistent (> three weeks) residual anticoagulation. Half-life and repeat-exposure studies highlighted the risk to birds from multiple exposures of brodifacoum in particular. Liver half lives in quail were longer than in rats for brodifacoum but shorter for <b>difenacoum.</b> The magnitude and duration of anticoagulation was greatly increased by multiple exposures involving brodifacoum and {{was the result of a}} complex interplay (including inhibition of binding and replacement) between residues in the liver.
