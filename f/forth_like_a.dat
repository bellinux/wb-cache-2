500|$|In the summer, {{water would}} be used to sluice and pan the dirt, {{separating}} out the heavier gold from gravel. This required miners to construct sluices, which were sequences of wooden boxes [...] long, through which the dirt would be washed; up to 20 of these might be needed for each mining operation. The sluices in turn required lots of water, usually produced by creating a dam and ditches or crude pipes. [...] "Bench gold" [...] mining on the hill sides could not use sluice lines because water could not be pumped that high up. Instead, these mines used rockers, boxes that moved back and <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cradle, to create the motion needed for separation. Finally, the resulting gold dust could be exported out of the Klondike; exchanged for paper money at the rate of $16 ($430) per troy ounce (ozt) through one of the major banks that opened in Dawson City, or simply used as money when dealing with local traders.|$|E
500|$|Players {{dispatch}} enemies {{by either}} thrusting {{at them with}} his Dragon Sword or by defeating them using Power Boosting Items. These special items consume Ryu's [...] "ninja power", also located {{on the top of}} the screen. Power Boosting Items include the following: shurikens; [...] "Windmill Throwing Stars" [...] that move back and <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> boomerang; [...] "The Art of the Fire Wheel" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally upwards; [...] "Fire Dragon Balls" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally downwards; and the [...] "Invincible Fire Wheel" [...] that creates a barrier of three fireballs around Ryu, destroying any enemy that touches them. These items can be found in various crystal balls scattered throughout the levels, and they can be switched out by collecting another Power Boosting Item. The amount of ninja power used depends on the type of Power Boosting Item used. At the end of each Act Ryu fights a boss which has its own strength meter, located {{on the top of the}} screen. The boss's strength meter decreases every time the player damages it, and the boss is destroyed when the player completely depletes its strength meter.|$|E
500|$|Verlaine and Lloyd interplayed their guitars {{around the}} rhythm section's drum hits and basslines. Their dual playing drew on 1960s rock and avant-garde jazz styles, abandoning the layered power chords of {{contemporary}} punk rock {{in favor of}} melodic lines and counter-melodies. Verlaine established the song's rhythmic phrase, against which Lloyd played dissonant melodies. Lloyd had learned to notate his solos {{by the time they}} recorded Marquee Moon, allowing him to develop his solo for a song from introduction to variation and resolution. The two traded rhythmic and melodic lines several times on some songs while producing tension. [...] "There weren't many bands where the two guitars played rhythm and melody back and <b>forth,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> jigsaw puzzle", Lloyd said. Most of the solos on Marquee Moon followed a pattern wherein Verlaine ran up a major scale but regressed slightly after each step. On [...] "See No Evil", he soloed through a full octave before playing a blues-influenced riff, and on the title track, he played in a Mixolydian mode and lowered the seventh by half a step. Lloyd opened [...] "Friction" [...] by playing octaves before Verlaine's ringing harmonics and series of descending scales.|$|E
6000|$|... "You hold tight now!" [...] yelled Dick, and {{an instant}} later the bob went down over a ridge of the hill. Free of the drag, it shot <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> arrow from a bow, and soon began to crawl up to Peter Slade's turnout.|$|R
60|$|Impelled by {{the blows}} that rained upon him, now from this side, now from that, White Fang swung back and <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> erratic and jerky pendulum. Varying were the {{emotions}} that surged through him. At first, he had known surprise. Then came a momentary fear, when he yelped several times {{to the impact of}} the hand. But this was quickly followed by anger. His free nature asserted itself, and he showed his teeth and snarled fearlessly {{in the face of the}} wrathful god. This but served to make the god more wrathful. The blows came faster, heavier, more shrewd to hurt.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Clatterby station became {{alive with}} travellers. The train drew {{up to the}} platform. Some {{passengers}} got out; others got in. The engine which brought it there, being in need of rest, coal, and water, moved off to the shed. John Marrot with his lieutenant, Garvie, moved to the front on his iron horse, looking as calm and sedate in his conscious power as his horse looked heavy and unyielding in its stolidity. Never did two creatures more thoroughly belie themselves by their looks. The latent power of the iron horse could have shot it <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> arrow from a bow, or have blown the whole station to atoms. The smouldering fires in John's manly breast could have raised him from a begrimed, somewhat sluggish, driver to a brilliant hero.|$|R
2500|$|Shevchenko {{began writing}} poetry while still being a serf, and in 1840 his first {{collection}} of poetry, Kobzar, was published. According to Ivan Franko, a renowned Ukrainian poet {{in the generation}} after Shevchenko, [...] " [...] was [...] "a new world of poetry. It burst <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> spring of clear, cold water, and sparkled with a clarity, breadth and elegance of artistic expression not previously known in Ukrainian writing".|$|E
2500|$|Boromir {{accompanied}} Frodo {{south from}} Rivendell with the Fellowship. Before departing, he blew the Horn of Gondor loudly, {{saying that he}} [...] "would not go <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> thief into the night". Elrond, lord of the Elves in Rivendell, warned him not to blow the horn again until he had reached the border of Gondor. On the journey south, Boromir frequently questioned the wisdom of their leader, Gandalf the Wizard. Boromir did, however, prove himself a valuable companion on the Fellowship's attempt to pass over the Misty Mountains: he advised that firewood be collected before the attempt to climb Caradhras, and this saved the Fellowship from freezing to death. In the retreat from Caradhras, Boromir's strength and stamina was evident as he burrowed through shoulder-high snowbanks alongside Aragorn, in order to clear the path back down the mountain.|$|E

60|$|The wind howled, the {{branches}} of the forest stirred, and sent <b>forth</b> sounds <b>like</b> <b>an</b> incantation. Soon might be distinguished the various voices of the mighty trees, as they expressed their terror or their agony. The oak roared, the beech shrieked, the elm sent forth its deep and long-drawn groan; while ever and anon, amid a momentary pause, the passion of the ash was heard in moans of thrilling anguish.|$|R
40|$|Building {{structures}} possessing vertical stiffness irregularity with an {{open ground}} storey are common in areas of low and moderate seismicity. These types of structures translate back and <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> inverted pendulum during earthquake shaking, with the columns in the open storey often susceptible to severe damage and collapse. This paper presents an overview of a collaborative research project which has been undertaken by Swinburne University of Technology and The University of Melbourne, Australia. The paper presents outcomes of unique experimental field testing on a four-storey soft storey building in Melbourne. The major aim of the project is to study the load deflection behaviour of soft storey buildings when subjected to lateral loading and to assess the lateral load and drift capacity. The results from the field test {{will be used to}} develop a representative seismic performance assessment procedure for soft storey buildings subject to different levels of ground shaking using force and displacement principles...|$|R
60|$|The {{construction}} of the flower in another closely allied orchid, namely, the Catasetum, is widely different, though serving the same end; and is equally curious. Bees visit these flowers, {{like those of the}} Coryanthes, in order to gnaw the labellum; in doing this they inevitably touch a long, tapering, sensitive projection, or, as I have called it, the antenna. This antenna, when touched, transmits a sensation or vibration to a certain membrane which is instantly ruptured; this sets free a spring by which the pollen-mass is shot <b>forth,</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> arrow, in the right direction, and adheres by its viscid extremity {{to the back of the}} bee. The pollen-mass of the male plant (for the sexes are separate in this orchid) is thus carried to the flower of the female plant, where it is brought into contact with the stigma, which is viscid enough to break certain elastic threads, and retain the pollen, thus effecting fertilisation.|$|R

6000|$|Alas! {{when she}} went round with the tambourine, the golden youth of Castel-le-Gachis turned from her coldly. Here and there a single halfpenny was forthcoming; the net result of a {{collection}} never exceeded half a franc; and the Maire himself, after seven different applications, had contributed exactly twopence. A certain chill began to settle upon the artists themselves; {{it seemed as if}} they were singing to slugs; Apollo himself might have lost heart with such an audience. The Berthelinis struggled against the impression; they put their back into their work, they sang loud and louder, the guitar twanged <b>like</b> <b>a</b> living thing; and at last Leon arose in his might, and burst with inimitable conviction into his great song, [...] "Y a des honnetes gens partout!" [...] Never had he given more proof of his artistic mastery; it was his intimate, indefeasible conviction that Castel-le-Gachis formed an exception to the law he was now lyrically proclaiming, and was peopled exclusively by thieves and bullies; and yet, as I say, he flung it down <b>like</b> <b>a</b> challenge, he trolled it <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> article of faith; and his face so beamed the while that you would have thought he must make converts of the benches.|$|R
5000|$|The {{use of the}} tri-oval {{shape for}} {{automobile}} racing was conceived by Bill France, Sr. during the planning for Daytona. The triangular layout allowed fans in the grandstands an angular perspective of the cars coming towards and moving away from their vantage point. Traditional ovals (such as Indianapolis) offered only limited linear views of the course, and required fans {{to look back and}} <b>forth</b> much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tennis match. The tri-oval shape prevents fans from having to [...] "lean" [...] to see oncoming cars, and creates more forward sight lines.|$|R

6000|$|During {{the summer}} I met Mrs. Strickland not infrequently. I went {{now and then}} to {{pleasant}} little luncheons at her flat, and to rather more formidable tea-parties. We took a fancy to one another. I was very young, and perhaps she liked the idea of guiding my virgin steps on the hard road of letters; while for me it was pleasant to have someone I could go to with my small troubles, certain of an attentive ear and reasonable counsel. Mrs. Strickland had the gift of sympathy. It is a charming faculty, but one often abused by those who are conscious of its possession: for there is something ghoulish in the avidity with which they will pounce upon the misfortune of their friends so that they may exercise their dexterity. It gushes <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> oil-well, and the sympathetic pour out their sympathy with an abandon that is sometimes embarrassing to their victims. There are bosoms on which so many tears have been shed that I cannot bedew them with mine. Mrs. Strickland used her advantage with tact. You felt that you obliged her by accepting her sympathy. When, in the enthusiasm of my youth, I remarked on this to Rose Waterford, she said: ...|$|R

60|$|Going to a chest {{filled with}} various European articles, {{she took out}} two suits of new sailor frocks and trousers; and {{presenting}} them with a gracious smile, pushed us behind a calico screen, and left us.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Nick with a candid, {{reflective}} sigh, [...] "you can rear a great {{structure of}} many things--not only of stones and timbers and painted glass." [...] They walked round this example of one, pausing, criticising, admiring, and discussing; mingling the grave with {{the gay and}} paradox with contemplation. Behind and at the sides the huge, dusky vessel of the church seemed to dip into the Seine or rise out of it, floating expansively--a ship of stone with its flying buttresses thrown <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> array of mighty oars. Nick Dormer lingered near it in joy, in soothing content, {{as if it had}} been the temple of a faith so dear to him that there was peace and security in its precinct. And there was comfort too and consolation of the same sort in the company at this moment of Nash's equal appreciation, of his response, by his own signs, to the great effect. He took it all in so and then so gave it all out that Nick was reminded of the radiance his boyish admiration had found in him of old, the easy grasp of everything of that kind. [...] "Everything of that kind" [...] was to Nick's sense the description of a wide and bright domain.|$|R
6000|$|Not merely so, but {{the girl}} felt in herself {{potentialities}} not yet drawn upon, unlimited capabilities leading towards the accomplishment of good.

It could diffuse warmth <b>like</b> <b>a</b> flame, and send <b>forth</b> joy <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bell. [...] "With it I am safe, strong: I can help the poor. Without it I am only <b>a</b> struggling girl, <b>like</b> millions of others, with no chance and no power to aid those who suffer." [...] But at this point her love re-entered and her sense of right was confused. After all the heart ruled.|$|R

Wise men know that the real wonder, the real miracle is, that a dove's egg always produces a dove, and not any and every other bird.|$|R
