40|$|The current {{baseline}} <b>injection</b> <b>orbit</b> for the jointly sponsored NASA/CNES TOPEX/Poseidon {{mission is}} near-circular, approximately 30 km below the desired operational orbit altitude {{and at the}} operational orbit inclination. A baseline maneuver sequence to retarget from this <b>injection</b> <b>orbit</b> to the desired operational orbit has been designed based upon the expected worst-case 3 -sigma injection and maneuver execution errors. The sequence requires seven maneuvers, including an initial calibration burn, and achieves the operational orbit with the desired ground track pattern in 30 days. A delay sensitivity analysis has been conducted to estimate the allowable operational delay for each maneuver without increasing the total orbit acquisition period. The baseline sequence provides back-ups for a one-revolution delay for each maneuver and one-day delay for most maneuvers.

40|$|When {{designing}} a FFAG accelerator for protons we found convenient {{to follow this}} procedure [1]. (1) We assume a Non-Scaling Lattice (NSL) because the aim is toward a compact layout, though {{we are aware of}} the issue of multiple resonance crossing. (2) We take a periodic sequence of FDF triplets as these have been proven to exhibit a very small dispersion function. (3) The reference trajectory is taken to be the <b>injection</b> <b>orbit</b> that corresponds to the lowest value of the acceleration momentum range. (4) Finally, the magnets in the triplet have all a linear field profile. We have indeed found recently [2, 3] that the Adjusted Field Profile (AFP) to cancel the horizontal chromaticity is exceedingly non-linear and it causes a too large betatron tune variation with the amplitude of motion. A sequence of FDF triplets is shown in Figure 1. They are made of sector magnets having parallel entrance and exit planes facing each other. Only for the <b>injection</b> <b>orbit</b> the trajectory in the magnets is made of arcs of circle. The magnets have sharp edges and there is no entrance or exit angle only for the reference (<b>injection)</b> <b>orbit</b> [4]. This solution minimizes magnet width, has the most stable momentum range, and allows longer drifts between triplets. Figure 2 shows a schematic of a FDF triplet with all the essential parameters. It is defined by 8 variables: the long drift S, the short drift g, the length L{sub F}, the bending field B, on the reference orbit, and the field gradient G{sub F} of the focusing (F) sector magnets, and the same quantities L{sub D}, B{sub D} and G{sub D} of the de-focusing sector magnet (D). To these we need to add the particle magnetic rigidity Bp (or equivalently the momentum p) and the full ring circumference C.
