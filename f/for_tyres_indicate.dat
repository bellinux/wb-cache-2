40|$|The {{transition}} towards increased forward speeds {{in agriculture}} introduces new technical {{problems related to}} dynamic behaviour and the exposure of tractor drivers {{to high levels of}} whole-body vibration during on-road and off-road transportation and during field operations. In this study, vibrations transmitted from the ground to the driver's seat have been analysed using methods that meet International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) standards using a four-wheel-drive tractor, equipped with a front suspension axle and a suspended cab, operating at 11. 1 and 13. 9 m s? 1. The test runs simulating the transportation of agricultural implements were conducted on a rectilinear plane tract of a conglomerate bituminous closed track. Two different tyre types, coded ‘A’ and ‘B’, were tested at different forward speeds. Values for the root-mean-square (RMS) accelerations for each measurement axis and the corresponding vector sum av measured on the tractor rear axle were not proportional to the forward speeds 11. 1 and 13. 9 m s? 1 <b>for</b> <b>tyre</b> A. <b>For</b> <b>tyre</b> B, the vector sum av decreased by 18 %. No significant difference was found in the acceleration values on the driver's seat. A 1 / 3 octave band analysis was performed at the frequency range 1 – 1000 Hz. Accelerations of the tractor rear axle, beyond the forward speed range of 11. 1 – 13. 9 m s? 1, increased by 48 % along the vertical Z-axis in the frequency range 400 – 1000 Hz <b>for</b> <b>tyre</b> A and decreased by 66 % in the frequency range 1 – 2 Hz along the horizontal X-axis and by 28 % along the Y-axis <b>for</b> <b>tyre</b> B. Comparing the two tyres at 11. 1 m s? 1 forward speed, the average acceleration values <b>for</b> <b>tyre</b> B compared with tyre A were lower along the X-axis (84 %) and greater along the Z (74 %) and Y (51 %) axes. Comparing the two tyres at 13. 9 m s? 1 forward speed, the acceleration values <b>for</b> <b>tyre</b> B compared with tyre A were lower along the X-axis (78 %) and greater (53 %) along the Z-axis. The same analysis was also applied to driving seat accelerations at frequencies of 1 – 80 Hz. Accelerations <b>for</b> <b>tyre</b> A appeared to have similar trends at the two forward speeds except along the vertical Z-axis, for which acceleration decreased by 22 % when forward speed increased. <b>For</b> <b>tyre</b> B, the average acceleration along the X-axis increased by 50 % in the frequency range 1 – 2. 5 Hz when forward speed increased. On the other hand, accelerations along the Y and Z axes decreased by 27 % and 44 %, respectively, when forward speed increased. Comparing the two tyres at 11. 1 m s? 1, average accelerations <b>for</b> <b>tyre</b> B were found. They were lower by 36 % along the X-axis in the frequency range 1 – 2. 5 Hz and greater by 14 % along the Z-axis compared with tyre A. At 13. 9 m s? 1 forward speed, the average acceleration <b>for</b> <b>tyre</b> B compared with tyre A was lower by 17 % along the Y-axis. Despite the differences in behaviour of the two tyres with respect to forward speed, the performances were the same in the values of limit fatigue that were bounded within the limit of 4 h for all treatments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the improvement of}} properties of ENR/Si composites by using concentrated ENR without using any chemical modification on the silica or latex. The composite showed a stronger reinforcing ability without addition of coupling agents. The ENR matrix reinforced the rubber by increasing the compatibility between rubber matrix and silica. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy were performed to study the composites topology. The importance {{of this study is}} to prepare masterbatch containing ENR reinforced with Si <b>for</b> <b>tyre</b> processing industry.

50|$|Prost and Senna were on {{the limit}} the entire race and Prost hounded Senna for 16 laps, until he went in for his pit stop <b>for</b> <b>tyres,</b> which was a terribly slow one of 18 seconds, which put Mansell in second place and Senna even further away. The next lap, Mansell came into the pits <b>for</b> his <b>tyre</b> change and his pit stop was faster than Prost's but still a poor stop of 11 seconds, which dropped him down back to fourth behind, Senna, Pirro and Prost. Then Senna decided to take {{advantage}} of his huge lead and came into the pits <b>for</b> his <b>tyre</b> change, but his stop was even worse than Prost's, lasting 23 seconds.

5000|$|A hugely {{significant}} change in 2005 was the absence of tyre changes during pit stops. Under new regulations, a driver had to use one set of tyres during qualifying and the race itself. Tyre changes were allowed for punctures and for wet weather, {{under the direction of}} the FIA. The FIA had to post a [...] "change in climatic conditions" [...] notice in order <b>for</b> <b>tyre</b> changes to occur normally. After Kimi Räikkönen's disastrous accident at the Nurburgring when his suspension collapsed after a flat-spotted tyre ripped the carbon fiber suspension apart, team principals and the FIA agreed that a single tyre change per car could be made without penalty, provided it was to change a tyre that had become dangerously worn like Räikkönen's had. Obviously, preserving a single set of <b>tyres</b> <b>for</b> the entire race became a new challenge for drivers; the challenge <b>for</b> <b>tyre</b> manufactures was to produce more durable, long-lasting compounds. Michelin-shod runners had a distinct advantage over their Bridgestone counterparts.|$|R

He then passed Blundell for third in the first chicane on the next lap, Brundle having dropped back to midfield due to serving his stop-go penalty on lap 12. Senna had worked his way up to seventh but was unable to pass Berger's Ferrari, eventually choosing to pit <b>for</b> <b>tyres,</b> as did first Patrese and Blundell, leaving the order midway through the race: Hill, Prost, Schumacher, Berger, Blundell, Patrese and Senna, neither Williams choosing to come in <b>for</b> <b>tyres</b> in this race. Blundell on new tyres was able to pass Berger for fourth only for the Austrian to repass him on the next straight with some fierce slipstreaming. Blundell eventually passed Berger for good coming into the stadium section, with Patrese and Senna both closing rapidly on the Austrian. Senna gained fifth place, passing both Patrese and Berger on the following lap, with Patrese also able to slipstream past the Ferrari, which was suffering increasingly on its aging tyres. Schumacher then stopped for a third set of tyres dropping him further behind the two Williams cars while still half a minute clear of Blundell in fourth position, who preserved a slight gap to Senna's McLaren in fifth.|$|R
