40|$|The {{number of}} {{university}} {{students participating in}} <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> has risen sharply over the last decade, but a survey of Swiss university graduates (class of 1999 and 2001) shows that participation in student <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> significantly prolongs {{the period of time}} spent studying at university. Given this fact, the advantages of <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> for students need to be identified. Analyses show that student <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> are associated with higher starting salaries and an increased likelihood of opting for postgraduate study - but only if all exchange semesters are factored in, not just those accredited by the university of matriculation. Using instrumental variable estimations (IV), however, shows that the cited outcomes are not causally related to participation in <b>exchange</b> <b>programs.</b> Therefore the big question is: Where's the benefit that justifies having to study for almost a whole year longer...|$|R

5|$|Between 1962 and 1972, the Test Pilot School {{expanded}} its role to include astronaut training for military test pilots. Thirty-seven TPS graduates of this era {{were selected for}} the U.S. space program, and twenty-six went on to earn astronaut's wings by flying in the X-15, Gemini, Apollo, and Space Shuttle programs. Although the school no longer trains astronauts, many TPS graduates since 1972 have been selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for duties in space. The school encourages applications from civilians, personnel from other U.S. military services, and individuals from foreign countries. An <b>exchange</b> <b>program</b> allows selected students to attend other test pilot schools including the United States Naval Test Pilot School, the United Kingdom's Empire Test Pilots' School, and France's EPNER.|$|E
5|$|MIT's {{proximity}} to Harvard University ("the other school up the river") {{has led to}} a substantial number of research collaborations such as the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and the Broad Institute. In addition, students at the two schools can cross-register for credits toward their own school's degrees without any additional fees. A cross-registration program between MIT and Wellesley College has also existed since 1969, and in 2002 the Cambridge–MIT Institute launched an undergraduate <b>exchange</b> <b>program</b> between MIT and the University of Cambridge. MIT has more modest cross-registration programs with Boston University, Brandeis University, Tufts University, Massachusetts College of Art and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.|$|E
5|$|Regarding public housing, Tufaro {{called for}} renovations rather than {{demolishing}} vacant buildings, which drew criticism, as Housing Commissioner Daniel P. Henson III {{pointed out that}} renovating was more expensive than demolishing. O'Malley promised to enforce provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which require banks to invest in poor neighborhoods. Tufaro further proposed a plan for school vouchers and to drug test students, which drew opposition from the Baltimore Teachers Union and from O'Malley, who favored expanding pre-kindergarten and after-school programs, while making summer school mandatory. When discussing the problem of HIV/AIDS in Baltimore, which disproportionately affects African Americans, both O'Malley and Tufaro promised to continue the city's needle <b>exchange</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E

The number of exchanges per year dropped from nearly 45,000 individuals to less than 30,000. The State Department recognizes a general lack of funding. While spending on traditional diplomacy amounted to $25 billion in 2002 and intelligence spending was $30 billion the same year, spending on <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> was at $232 million, a decline from the $349 million spent on <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> in 1993.|$|R
5|$|While in England, Andrew met Bessie Ball, of Nottingham, {{and they}} were married on 12 November 1918. The couple had five {{children}} although one died in infancy. Upon discharge from the NZEF in August 1919, he joined the New Zealand Staff Corps and served {{in a number of}} administrative positions for the next several years. From 1927 to 1929 he served with the Highland Light Infantry in British India on an officer <b>exchange</b> <b>program.</b> On his return to New Zealand he was appointed adjutant of the 1st Wellington Regiment. In 1937, having been promoted to captain, he commanded the New Zealand contingent sent to London for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|Calleia {{became a}} {{naturalized}} {{citizen of the}} United States in November 1941. During World War II, Calleia led the Malta War Relief organization in the U.S. The house {{where he was born}} was destroyed in 1942; his family took refuge underground, in ancient catacombs, during the near-constant aerial bombing of Malta by the Axis powers that continued for more than two years. Under the auspices of the Motion Picture Division of USO Camp Shows, he made personal appearances at U.S. military facilities in 1943. He also accepted an invitation from the Hollywood Victory Committee to make a tour of military camps in North Africa, particularly because the tentative itinerary included Malta. On the 20,000-mile trip Calleia and his small troupe entertained service personnel in Natal, Dakar, along the coast to Casablanca and across to Tunis before going to Malta, which Calleia had not visited since 1922. They gave two shows a day and visited all of the hospitals at each stop; and they presented six shows in Malta as part of the <b>exchange</b> <b>program</b> between U.S. and British entertainment units.|$|E
5|$|Driehaus then {{served as}} Associate Director of the Center for International Education and Development Assistance at Indiana University.

5|$|Homer trips over Bart's {{skateboard}} {{and falls}} down the stairs, hurting his back, and {{is confined to}} the couch for several days. Marge sends Bart to clean his room and while doing so, he discovers an old cherry bomb among his things. At school the next day, he decides to flush it down the toilet in the boys' restroom with friends, Milhouse, Richard and Lewis. On the same day, Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes, is visiting the school and Bart ends up pulling his prank the same time Agnes is using the facilities in an adjacent girls' restroom. The resulting explosion blows her off of her seat and enrages Principal Skinner. In order to punish him, Principal Skinner proposes deportation to Homer and Marge, by having Bart participate in a foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>program.</b> They decide to send Bart to France, while the Simpsons host a student from the Socialist People's Republic of Albania, named Adil Hoxha. Bart is shown {{a picture of a}} lovely château in the heart of France and he immediately agrees to go, much to Homer and Skinner's delight.|$|E
5|$|In May 1950, Bolt was {{reassigned to}} VMF-224 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, and he {{remained}} there until May 1951. The squadron flew the F2H Banshee and {{within three months}} of joining the unit he had flown more hours on the aircraft than any other pilot in the squadron. This {{was followed by a}} quick four-month tour on the staff at the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. During this time, the US Air Force was operating its first squadron of F-86 Sabre aircraft. The Sabres were the only U.S. aircraft which performed well against the MiG-15s operated by China and North Korea in the Korean War. Bolt used his connections to enter an <b>exchange</b> <b>program</b> with the USAF in September 1951, becoming an exchange officer with the 318th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at McChord Air Force Base in Washington flying the F-94 Starfire. Soon after, he began piloting the F-86F Sabre which had been transferred to the squadron. He continued training with the squadron and was promoted to major in December 1951.|$|E
5|$|While training, Miller flew Beauforts, Beaufighters and Mosquitos. He {{had another}} near death experience: {{mechanical}} problems {{forced him to}} make an emergency landing of his Beaufighter. The plane was repaired for use by others, but, on its next flight, the pilot was killed when the problem recurred. On another occasion, Miller avoided colliding with a hangar by centimetres. He then escaped death by skipping a social appointment; a V1 bomb hit the venue and killed many of the patrons. In October, he went AWL to watch a concert and was summarily discharged, but the CO revoked his decision after Miller agreed to play for his cricket team. At {{the end of his}} officer training, Miller was sent aboard a Royal Navy destroyer as part of an <b>exchange</b> <b>program</b> between the forces. During a mission to Belgium, the vessel fought a German U-boat, which was sunk. Upon his return to England, Miller was promoted to flying officer on 4 November 1944.|$|E
