25|$|The carving {{seems to}} have been {{completed}} by December 1658, for Symon White (who is evidently a superior workman, receiving 22d. a day, the highest wage paid to anyone, and who was the master carver) is no longer employed. No other carvers are mentioned, and as there is not a great deal of ornament, he may <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> the work himself, with the aid perhaps of his apprentices. Very probably he designed it also, and was, no doubt, trained in the new school of classic design, after the manner of Nicholas Stone, {{or any of the other}} carvers of that date, whose work could then be seen on St. Mary's Church porch, or elsewhere. Whether for temperance' sake or for other reasons bevers are now abated, and after this date John Jackson is not paid as overseer.|$|E
25|$|Wilson, in {{temporary}} command of First Army in Monro's absence from 9 May 22 May, {{had to take}} over some more trench from Byng’s XVII Corps (part of Allenby’s Third Army) opposite Vimy Ridge. Two divisional commanders, William Walker (2nd, sick) and Barter (47th, on leave) were away until 22 May, further disrupting {{the chain of command}} as various officers were required to act in their seniors’ place. A surprise German attack on the evening of Sunday 21 May moved forward 800 yards, capturing 1,000 yards of the British front line. Wilson appears to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> he could, arranging the assembly of artillery from First Army and neighbouring Third Army, but the planned counterattack was postponed until 23 May by Monro, who had just returned from leave. At a major meeting at Wilson’s HQ (23 May) Monro and Allenby insisted the IV Corps counterattack must proceed, over the objection of John Headlam (artillery) and Tavish Davidson (Director of Military Operations) from GHQ, who passed on Haig’s wishes that the counterattack be postponed by a fortnight.|$|E

500|$|The first {{skeleton}} practice began {{down the}} full length of the track on 15 February 2010. It {{was the first time that}} had been done since Kumaritashvili's death three days earlier. Britain's Shelley Rudman stated that [...] "The IOC and VANOC <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> they can to make it a safe environment". Canada's Mellisa Hollingsworth had the fastest women's practice runs while her teammate Montgomery had the fastest men's practice runs. Montgomery and Hollingsworth also had the fastest practice times on both the 16th and the 17th. No crashes occurred during the two days of skeleton competitions.|$|E
500|$|Because McClellan {{failed to}} pursue Lee aggressively after Antietam, Lincoln ordered {{that he be}} removed from command on November 5, 1862. Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside assumed command of the Army of the Potomac on November 9, 1862. McClellan wrote to his wife, [...] "Those in whose {{judgment}} I rely tell me that I fought the battle splendidly {{and that it was}} a masterpiece of art. ... I feel I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> that can be asked in twice saving the country. ... I feel some little pride in having, with a beaten & demoralized army, defeated Lee so utterly. ... Well, one of these days history will I trust do me justice." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the evening}} progressed Huskisson {{continued}} to weaken. The doctors {{had concluded that}} without amputation {{he would continue to}} deteriorate, but that he had no realistic chance of surviving major surgery, and broke this news to the Huskissons. William Huskisson already believed that he was dying and had resigned himself to his fate; Emily Huskisson at first caused [...] "a dreadful scene... but at last she calmed herself and {{during the rest of the}} time sat weeping by the couch". Huskisson told Brandreth [...] "You see I shall never live to make any return for your kindness. You <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> that is possible, but it is all in vain." [...] After further laudanum, he complained [...] "Why endeavour to support my strength? I must die, it is only prolonging my sufferings." ...|$|E

500|$|The film also {{received}} some mixed reactions from critics. Writing for Hindustan Times, Anupama Chopra rated the film 2.5 out of 5 {{and believed that}} the film didn't fulfill its potential, but said, [...] "It's an interesting scenario and Suri and his actors set it up well. Aditya gives Rahul's angst a certain charm. He is earnest and broken. And the real triumph here is Shraddha, whose porcelain face has a haunting vulnerability. She's very good as {{the woman in the}} throes of a grand passion who believes that love will show the way." [...] Resham Sengar rated the film 2.5 and questioned the logic behind the script and believed that several of the scenes either dragged on excessively or were too abrupt, which affected the quality of the entire film. India Today also gave the film a rating of 2.5 stars out of four, and argued that the film was only a success because of its soundtrack, saying that the film [...] "merely banks on the power of saleable music and the novelty of a fresh cast to enable brothers Bhatt, Mahesh and Mukesh, [...] make maximum moolah within minimum budget as they <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> along." ...|$|E
500|$|At Trenton, Washington faced a dilemma. All but {{a handful}} of his men's enlistments were expiring on December 31, and he knew that the army would {{collapse}} unless he convinced them to stay. So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances." [...] At first no one stepped forward, but then one soldier stepped forward, and he was followed by most of the others, leaving only a few in the original line.|$|E
500|$|The quest {{group is}} {{challenged}} to successfully recruit allies for the Regalians, and then journeys to find Gregor's dad emaciated and tortured {{in the personal}} prison of King Gorger. When the rat king discovers their rescue attempt, Henry reveals {{that he has been}} helping the rats all along, hoping to ally them with the Regalians and conquer the entire Underland. During the questers' attempt to escape, Gregor sacrifices himself to lure the rats' attack force — King Gorger and Henry among them — off the edge of a cliff. Henry's bat Ares, who had no knowledge of his bond's treachery, chooses to save Gregor rather than Henry as they fall. When the few remaining quest members make it back to Regalia, Luxa and her family are devastated, both because of Henry's treason and death and because Ares has been sentenced to banishment (essentially a death sentence in the Underland) for allowing his bond to die. Gregor saves his life by using his status as the [...] "warrior" [...] to form a new bond with him. When things have settled down somewhat and the Regalian doctors <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> they can for his father, Gregor and his family return to the surface.|$|E

500|$|Returning to England for the 1906 season, Crawford {{completed}} the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in first-class cricket, the youngest player {{at the time}} to accomplish this feat. Against Gloucestershire, he scored 148 and then took seven for 85 and four for 63 with the ball; he also took ten wickets in his next game. In total, he compiled 1,174 runs at an average of 30.10, and took 118 wickets at an average of 20.28. These performances earned him selection for the representative Gentlemen versus Players matches at both Lord's and The Oval, in which he played for the amateur Gentlemen. At the end of the season, he was chosen as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation said: [...] "Few cricketers have won equal fame at so early an age", and noted the unusual ease with which he had moved into first-class cricket. Crawford's powerful batting and straight hitting were praised, as was his accurate bowling. The report also stated: [...] "That he should <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> this is the more astonishing from the fact that he invariably plays in glasses. No one handicapped in this way has ever been so consistently successful both as batsman and bowler." ...|$|E

The British firm was not pleased by this about-face, although it was allowed to keep the cartridge factory, and seems to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> it could to be unhelpful from then on, as an unpublished report taken from the private archives of Hubert Debauche suggests.|$|E

[...] Suburban councillors Gloria Lindsay Luby and Doug Holyday came out opposed while inner-city councillor Kyle Rae fought for the proposal. Mayor David Miller did not favour the proposal either, stating that there were other, higher priorities. The proposal did not come to Council for discussion and vote.|$|E

He wrote an open letter to Photoplay magazine, titled [...] "Open Letter to the American Public", where he argued his case, {{although}} the average American had trouble sympathizing, as most made $2,000 a year. Famous Players made their own public statements deeming him more trouble than he was worth (the divorce, bigamy trials, debts) and that he was temperamental, almost diva-like.

2500|$|The fort's central {{flagpole}} {{was knocked}} down at 1 p.m. on April 13, raising doubts among the Confederates {{about whether the}} fort was ready to surrender. Col. Louis Wigfall, a former U.S. senator, had been observing the battle and decided that this indicated the fort had had enough punishment. He commandeered a small boat and proceeded from Morris Island, waving a white handkerchief from his sword, dodging incoming rounds from Sullivan's Island. Meeting with Major Anderson, he said, [...] "You have defended your flag nobly, Sir. You <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> {{that it is possible}} to do, and General Beauregard wants to stop this fight. On what terms, Major Anderson, will you evacuate this fort?" [...] Anderson was encouraged that Wigfall had said [...] "evacuate," [...] not [...] "surrender." [...] He was low on ammunition, fires were burning out of control, and his men were hungry and exhausted. Satisfied that they had defended their post with honor, enduring over 3,000 Confederate rounds without losing a man, Anderson agreed to a truce at 2:00p.m.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 May 2007, Lee officially {{declared}} {{his intention to}} seek the nomination of the Grand National Party (GNP) as its presidential candidate. On 20 August 2007, he defeated Park Geun-hye in the GNP's primary to become the party's nominee for the 2007 Presidential election. During the primary, Lee was accused of profiting from illegal speculation on land owned in Dogok-dong, an expensive neighborhood in Seoul. However, in August 2007, the prosecutors said in the interim announcement, [...] "We do suspect Lee's brother's claim over the land in Dogok-dong, but have failed to verify the real owner of the asset." [...] On 28 September 2007, the prosecutory authority officially dropped the suspicion that the Dogok land was under a borrowed name, announcing, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> necessary investigations, including tracing the proceeds {{from the sale of}} the land and call history, and now got {{to the bottom of this}} case." [...] In December 2007, a few days before the presidential election, Lee announced that he would donate all of his assets to society.|$|E
2500|$|On November 19, 1823, at age 25, Smith died {{of mercury}} {{poisoning}} from calomel, {{which had been}} administered to cure a case of “bilious colic.” Smith was a believer in his brother Joseph's claim that Joseph was to recover an ancient record from a nearby hill. His death occurred two months after Joseph’s {{first visit to the}} hill from which he was eventually said to have recovered the golden plates that would later be claimed as the source for the Book of Mormon. According to a history written by his mother, Lucy Mack Smith, as Smith lay dying he called each member of his family to his bedside to give them counsel. To his brother Hyrum, Smith said, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> I could to make our dear parents comfortable. I want you to go on and finish the house." [...] He urged his brother Joseph to fulfill all of the requirements to obtain the record. Smith's death had a significant effect on the family, resulting in Joseph taking more of a leadership role.|$|E
