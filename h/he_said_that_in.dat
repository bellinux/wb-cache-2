25|$|Gentzen {{asserted}} a sharp {{distinction between}} his single-output natural deduction systems (NK and NJ) and his multiple-output sequent calculus systems (LK and LJ). He {{wrote that the}} intuitionistic natural deduction system NJ was somewhat ugly. He said that the special role of the excluded middle in the classical natural deduction system NK is removed in the classical sequent calculus system LK. He said that the sequent calculus LJ gave more symmetry than natural deduction NJ {{in the case of}} intuitionistic logic, as also in the case of classical logic (LK versus NK). Then <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> addition to these reasons, the sequent calculus with multiple succedent formulas is intended particularly for his principal theorem ("Hauptsatz").|$|E

25|$|The {{controversy}} raged {{within the}} navy and in public for about {{a decade after the}} war. Criticism focused on Jellicoe's decision at 19:15. Scheer had ordered his cruisers and destroyers forward in a torpedo attack to cover the turning away of his battleships. Jellicoe chose to turn to the south-east, and so keep out of range of the torpedoes. Supporters of Jellicoe, including the historian Cyril Falls, pointed to the folly of risking defeat in battle when one already has command of the sea. Jellicoe himself, {{in a letter to the}} Admiralty seventeen months before the battle, said that he intended to turn his fleet away from any mass torpedo attack (that being the universally accepted proper tactical response to such attacks, practised by all the major navies of the world). <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> the event of a fleet engagement in which the enemy turned away, he would assume they intended to draw him over mines or submarines, and he would decline to be so drawn. The Admiralty approved this plan and expressed full confidence in Jellicoe at the time (October 1914).|$|E
25|$|Egyptian Islamic jurist and {{religious}} scholar Muhammad Abduh, {{regarded as one}} of the key founding figures of Islamic Modernism or sometimes called Neo-Mu’tazilism, broke the rigidity of the Muslim ritual, dogma, and family ties. Abduh argued that Muslims could not simply rely on the interpretations of texts provided by medieval clerics, they needed to use reason to keep up with changing times. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Islam man was not created to be led by a bridle, man was given intelligence so that he could be guided by knowledge. According to Abduh, a teacher’s role was to direct men towards study. He believed that Islam encouraged men to detach from the world of their ancestors and that Islam reproved the slavish imitation of tradition. He said that the two greatest possessions relating to religion that man was graced with were independence of will and independence of thought and opinion. It was with the help of these tools that he could attain happiness. He believed that the growth of western civilization in Europe was based on these two principles. He thought that Europeans were roused to act after a large number of them were able to exercise their choice and to seek out facts with their minds. In his works, he portrays God as educating humanity from its childhood through its youth and then on to adulthood. According to him, Islam is the only religion whose dogmas can be proven by reasoning. He was against polygamy and thought that it was an archaic custom. He believed in a form of Islam that would liberate men from enslavement, provide equal rights for all human beings, abolish the religious scholar’s monopoly on exegesis and abolish racial discrimination {{and religious}} compulsion.|$|E

500|$|Captain Michael Worsley, a {{military}} psychologist who had treated Manning before her arrest, testified that Manning {{had been left}} isolated in the Army, {{trying to deal with}} gender-identity issues in a [...] "hyper-masculine environment". David Moulton, a Navy forensic psychiatrist who saw Manning after the arrest, said Manning had narcissistic traits, and showed signs of both fetal alcohol syndrome and Asperger syndrome. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> leaking the material, Manning had been [...] "acting out [...] grandiose ideation".|$|E
500|$|The novel {{belongs to}} the Dying Earth subgenre. It is rooted in hard science fiction, but also {{incorporates}} several other genres, including fantasy and horror. Bear called it science fiction [...] "stretched to the nth degree". <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the novel he honors those writers who {{changed the face of}} science fiction and fantasy, including William Hope Hodgson and Arthur C. Clarke, and pays homage to Hodgson's 1912 novel, The Night Land, with which City at the End of Time shares a number of plot elements.|$|E
500|$|Raz {{expressed}} a similar view. Expanding {{on the concept}} in a 1977 article, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> its broadest sense, {{the rule of law}} means that people should obey the law and be ruled by it. On the other hand, a narrower construction {{of the rule of law}} means that the government shall be ruled by and subjected to the law. The doctrine of the rule of law also requires that [...] "the making of particular laws should be guided by open and relatively stable general rules".|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> {{elsewhere}} <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> {{creating the}} book he used golden sectioning, [...] "a mathematical formula to arrange elements in a unified structure, to create an image-to-text relationship that readers would be very comfortable with.

6000|$|... "Under these {{accumulated}} misfortunes Josiah {{had sought}} consolation in drink, {{and had become}} a hopeless sot. He felt his degradation keenly, and wept copiously. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>that</b> <b>in</b> a cheerful place, such as a bar, {{he might have been}} strong and brave; but that {{there was something about the}} everlasting smell of damp clothes and suds, that seemed to sap his manhood.|$|R
500|$|Richard Curtis {{developed}} the film from thoughts while lying awake at night. He described {{the starting point}} as [...] "the idea of a very normal person going out with an unbelievably famous person and how that impinges on their lives". Four Weddings and a Funeral director Mike Newell was approached but rejected it to work on Pushing Tin. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> commercial terms {{he had made the}} wrong decision, but did not regret it. The producer, Duncan Kenworthy, then turned to Roger Michell, saying that [...] "Finding someone as good as Roger, was just like finding the right actor to play each role. Roger shone out." ...|$|E
500|$|At the September 26 MSNBC debate, Biden {{explained}} {{how he would}} allow for Social security to last. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s he {{had a meeting with}} prominent members of Congress and the solution they came up with was the raise the cap level, he stated that now the same solution would apply and that unity between the two parties was also necessary, [...] "It was Joe Biden, Pat Moynihan, Bob Dole... George Mitchell when we made that deal [...] I'll never forget Bob Dole turning to Pat Moynihan and saying, 'we all got to jump in this boat at the same time.' So the bottom line here is, you can't do it by growing the economy alone. So I would raise the cap." [...] Later in the debate Biden was one of three participants (along with Dodd and Richardson) who said they would ban smoking in public places.|$|E
500|$|A {{sequel to}} God of War was first teased {{at the end}} of its credits, which stated, [...] "Kratos Will Return". God of War II was officially {{announced}} at the 2006 Game Developers Conference (GDC). God of War Game Director David Jaffe stepped down and became the Creative Director of its sequel. God of Wars lead animator Cory Barlog assumed the role of Game Director. In an interview with Computer and Video Games (CVG) in June 2006, Barlog said that while working on the first few drafts of script, he studied the mythology extensively. He said that the mythology is so large that [...] "the real difficulty is picking things that really fit within the story of Kratos as well as being easy to swallow for audiences." [...] Although he loves the idea of teaching things through storytelling (in this case Greek mythology), Barlog said, [...] "you can't let your story get bogged down by that." [...] <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the game, players would see [...] "a larger view of Kratos' role within the mythological world." [...] He also said that he liked the idea of a trilogy, but there were no plans [...] "as of right now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lindsey noted, however, that Indonesian {{courts have}} been [...] "quite {{inconsistent}} {{in how they}} interpret article '244', and have tended to read it <b>in</b> a way <b>that</b> will allow the appeal to go ahead". <b>He</b> also <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Australia, it is unusual for a prosecutor to appeal.|$|R
