40|$|X-ray microtomography, image {{processing}} and Weibull statistical methods {{were used to}} characterize the length and width distributions <b>of</b> <b>noil</b> hemp fibres before and after composite fabrication. X-ray microtomography provided direct observations and accurate measurements of length and width <b>of</b> <b>noil</b> hemp fibres within the hemp–polypropylene composite matrix. The effects of the weight content <b>of</b> the <b>noil</b> hemp fibre {{and the addition of}} compatibilizer on the fibre breakage and tensile strength of the composites were studied. The results indicated that the tensile strength <b>of</b> the <b>noil</b> hemp fibre reinforced composites without the coupling agent was lower than that of pure polypropylene. Fibre–fibre interaction mechanism indicated that high hemp content caused more fibre breakage. The addition of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) coupling agent improved the tensile strength of the composites by the enhanced fibre/matrix interfacial adhesion. The addition of MAPP also reduced the fibre breakage due to the better dispersion of fibres. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Silk</b> <b>noil</b> {{may also}} be made from the short fibres, {{directly}} sourced from the silkworm cocoons. Rather than the continuous length of silk, shorter fibers, which are generally not used to create high quality silk are used for <b>Silk</b> <b>Noil,</b> which has a slightly rough texture. It is relatively weaker and has low resilience. It tends to have very low lustre, which makes it appear more like cotton - than silk.|$|R

Effects of design parameters such as the nozzle diameter and entrance width <b>of</b> the <b>noil</b> box on the air velocity along nozzle axis, turbulence intensity, and jet deflection distance are studied. Larger nozzle diameters and larger entrance widths <b>of</b> the <b>noil</b> box are advantageous to the elimination of foreign fibers.

50|$|<b>Silk</b> <b>Noil</b> has an {{intriguing}} ancient past and hails from China, {{from where it}} was exported to Europe in the middle ages, especially to Italy. It was used to create silk blends, through {{the first half of}} the 14th century. However, over the time the use decreased.|$|R
50|$|Station Mill {{was built}} in 1834 by Thomas and Edward Platt, members of a family who had farmed Longdendale for generations. The family owned this cotton mill for 68 years, before selling it in 1923 to E. Wilman & Sons, which {{converted}} it to <b>silk</b> <b>noil</b> spinning. The mill closed in 1989.|$|R
40|$|Natural fibre-reinforced {{composites}} {{have attracted}} great research and economic interests {{because of their}} outstanding 'green' characteristics compared with glass fibre-reinforced composites. It {{is very important to}} understand the processing effect on the natural fibre-reinforced composites mechanical properties because of the natural fibre degradation characteristics. Optimizing the fabrication process, especially the compounding process, is effective to achieve the optimal properties of the composites. In this research a natural fibre, noil hemp fibre, was applied to reinforce polypropylene with internal mixing process. The influence of compounding parameters, such as mixing temperature, mixing time and rotor speed, on the mechanical properties (tensile strength, flexural strength and impact strength) <b>of</b> the <b>noil</b> hemp fibre/polypropylene composites was investigated using orthogonal method and the evidence of thermogravimetric analysis test of fibre and the observation of fibre dispersion in resin. The range analysis and variance of analysis demonstrated that the mixing temperature has significant effect on the three mechanical properties, mixing time has minor influence on the tensile and flexural strengths, and rotor speed mainly affects the impact strength. The thermogravimetric analysis test <b>of</b> <b>noil</b> hemp fibre and the fibre dispersion in resin show that a combination of low mixing temperature, short mixing time and high rotor speed of compounding process is helpful to achieve certain fibre dispersion without serious thermal degradation <b>of</b> fibre. <b>Noil</b> hemp fibre/polypropylene composites with the best comprehensive mechanical properties could be obtained at 165 degree C for 12 min with rotor speed 50 r/min. ...|$|R
5000|$|Noil is {{the short}} fiber {{left over from}} combing wool or {{spinning}} silk and used as a decorative additive for many spinning projects, like rovings and yarns. <b>Silk</b> <b>noil</b> is also called [...] "raw silk", although that is a misnomer. As noil is a relatively short fiber, fabric made from noil is weaker and considered less valuable.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Silk</b> <b>Noil</b> is also blended or {{appended}} with heavier fabrics like velvets and satins {{to create}} varied textures. Made {{out of the}} strongest natural fibres (with a protein base) around, the Noil Sarees are not slippery like synthetic fibres and absorb moisture well. Noils are easily dyed, and can also be made waterproof, by using a polyurethane coating. This also increases their usage in furnishings’ industry.|$|R

40|$|In this project, free {{vibration}} testing and {{dynamic mechanical analysis}} methods were used to study the damping properties <b>of</b> <b>noil</b> hemp fibre-reinforced polypropylene composites with varying fibre contents (0 to 60 [*]wt%) and compatibilizers (maleic anhydride-grafted polypropylene and maleic anhydride-grafted polyethylene octane) under applied frequencies of 1 to 200 [*]Hz. The storage modulus of the composites was increased by the increase in hemp fibre content. However, the maximum damping ratio {{was obtained from the}} composite with 30 [*]wt% noil hemp fibre. The addition of coupling agents reduced the damping capacity of all composites. However, 30 [*]wt% noil hemp fibre-reinforced polypropylene coupled with 2. 5 [*]wt% anhydride-grafted poly ethylene octane revealed the highest damping ratio among coupled composites. Damping properties of the composites were relatively constant over the frequency range, except at frequencies which the material–instrument system began to resonate and peaks were observed in the curves...|$|R
