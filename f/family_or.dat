5|$|A320 Enhanced <b>family</b> (<b>or</b> A320E family) is {{the working}} title {{for a series}} of {{improvements}} to the A320 family. The improvements include engine improvements, aerodynamic refinements– such as adding large curved winglets (Sharklets), weight savings, and a new cabin design.|$|E

50|$|Totem {{poles of}} the Pacific Northwest of North America are monumental poles of heraldry. They feature many {{different}} designs (bears, birds, frogs, people, and various supernatural beings and aquatic creatures) that function as crests of <b>families</b> <b>or</b> chiefs. They recount stories owned by those <b>families</b> <b>or</b> chiefs, or commemorate special occasions. These stories {{are known to}} be read {{from the bottom of the}} pole to the top.|$|R
5|$|Since Neighbours {{began in}} 1985, it {{has used its}} opening titles {{sequence}} to introduce the major characters which currently feature in the show. The sequences often feature the characters in <b>family</b> <b>or</b> domestic groups. Each episode's titles sequence was preceded by a recap of events from recent episodes featuring the characters who were {{to appear in the}} new episode.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the authors}} of Islamic Homosexualities argued this did not mean women could not engage in lesbian relationships, a lesbian {{anthropologist}} in 1991 visited Yemen and reported that women in the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman. Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; {{those who do not}} are ostracized. Women, however, may have intimate relations with other women as long as their wifely duties are met, their private matters are kept quiet, and the woman with whom they are involved is somehow related by <b>family</b> <b>or</b> logical interest to her lover.|$|E
5|$|Education {{remained}} mostly {{focused on}} the training of future clergy. The basic learning of the letters and numbers remained {{the province of the}} <b>family</b> <b>or</b> a village priest, but the secondary subjects of the trivium—grammar, rhetoric, logic—were studied in cathedral schools or in schools provided by cities. Commercial secondary schools spread, and some Italian towns had more than one such enterprise. Universities also spread throughout Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. Lay literacy rates rose, but were still low; one estimate gave a literacy rate of ten per cent of males and one per cent of females in 1500.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} ₱2.25 {{billion worth of}} damage to public buildings, roads, bridges, and flood {{controls}} was reported in Bohol and Cebu. A total of 671,103 <b>families</b> <b>or</b> more than 3.2 million people were affected by the quake. Out {{of the total number}} of affected, 71,822 <b>families</b> <b>or</b> more than 348,000 people were displaced.|$|R
5|$|Five leading {{families}} or factions contended for power during this period—the Shahs, Thapas, Basnyats, Pandes, and the Chautariyas, who were of Shah dynasty but acted as counselors for the King. Working for these {{families and their}} factions were hill Brahmans, who acted as religious preceptors or astrologers, and Newars, who occupied secondary administrative positions. No {{one else in the}} country had any influence on the central government. When a <b>family</b> <b>or</b> faction achieved power, it killed, exiled, or demoted members of opposing alliances. Under these circumstances, there was little opportunity for either public political life or coordinated economic development.|$|E
5|$|Folkloric vampirism {{has been}} {{associated}} with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same <b>family</b> <b>or</b> the same small community. The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of Mercy Brown and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of bubonic plague, it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips.|$|E
5|$|Groves and Conant {{were hoping}} to harness Thomas's {{industrial}} expertise {{for the benefit of}} the project. They offered him a post as a deputy to Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, but he did not wish to move his <b>family</b> <b>or</b> give up his responsibilities at Monsanto. Instead he accepted the role of coordinating the plutonium purification and production work being carried out at Los Alamos, the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, and Ames Laboratory in Iowa. Chemistry and metallurgy at Los Alamos would be led by the youthful Joseph W. Kennedy.|$|E

Monsanto's Central Research Department began to conduct research on behalf of the Manhattan Project as part of the Manhattan Project's Dayton Project, some of which was conducted on the estate of his wife's family.|$|E
5|$|Henri L'Estrange {{was born}} about 1842 in Fitzroy, {{a suburb of}} Melbourne. Little is known of his early years, <b>family</b> <b>or</b> private life. He first came to public {{attention}} in 1873 {{as a member of}} a Melbourne performance group, the Royal Comet Variety Troupe, a gymnastic, dancing and comedic vocal combination with Miss Lulu L'Estrange and Monsieur Julian. As part of this troupe, L'Estrange performed in Melbourne and Tasmania throughout 1873 and 1874, with Henri and Lulu performing together on the tightrope. In 1876, L'Estrange performed solo for the first time in Melbourne, and quickly gained a reputation as a fearless performer.|$|E
5|$|In Cuba, {{slightly}} over 228,000 residents were evacuated from low-lying areas before the storm. Around 10% stayed in temporary shelters, {{while the rest}} stayed with <b>family</b> <b>or</b> friends. Included in the evacuation total were 6,000 tourists and over 1,000 residents in rickety houses. Workers protected tobacco leaves by moving them to sealed warehouses, and transported cattle and livestock to higher ground. The hurricane forced the closure of schools and the cancellation of some flights. The Cuban government issued a Hurricane Watch for Pinar del Río Province, Havana, Havana Province, and Isla de la Juventud 21hours before Irene hit. These areas, along with Matanzas Province, were upgraded to a Hurricane Warning 15hours before Irene hit the area.|$|E

5|$|Khalifa {{has also}} said that her parents have stopped {{speaking}} to her because of her career choice. In a statement, her parents disassociated themselves from her actions, saying that her decision to enter the porn industry was born of her residence {{in a foreign country}} which had a different culture than theirs, and that her actions did not reflect her upbringing. They {{also said that}} they hoped that she would leave pornography, saying that her image did not honor her <b>family</b> <b>or</b> her home country.|$|E
5|$|Like the Shieldings’ lookout, {{one made}} {{guardian}} of the gateway to Lejre {{would have had to}} be trusted, and perhaps connected to the king by <b>family</b> <b>or</b> loyalty; the guardian would at least occupy an important position in the military hierarchy. Adornments like the Gevninge helmet fragment would have served to identify the rank of such a person, adding decoration to a helmet meant for more than just protection.|$|E
5|$|Naming and {{classifying}} our surroundings {{has probably}} been taking place as long as mankind {{has been able to}} communicate. It would always have been important to know the names of poisonous and edible plants and animals in order to communicate this information to other members of the <b>family</b> <b>or</b> group. Medicinal plant illustrations show up in Egyptian wall paintings from c. 1500 BC, indicating that the uses of different species were understood and that a basic taxonomy was in place.|$|E

5|$|Naming {{groups of}} organisms {{in a way}} that is clear and widely agreed is important, as some {{disputes}} in paleontology have been based just on misunderstandings over names. Linnaean taxonomy is commonly used for classifying living organisms, but runs into difficulties when dealing with newly discovered organisms that are significantly different from known ones. For example: it is hard to decide at what level to place a new higher-level grouping, e.g. genus or <b>family</b> <b>or</b> order; this is important since the Linnaean rules for naming groups are tied to their levels, and hence if a group is moved to a different level it must be renamed.|$|E
5|$|The ACCP {{recommended}} initial home treatment {{instead of}} hospital treatment {{for those with}} acute leg DVT. This applies as long as individuals feel ready for it, and those with severe leg symptoms or comorbidities would not qualify. An appropriate home environment is expected: one that can provide a quick return to the hospital if necessary, support from <b>family</b> <b>or</b> friends, and phone access.|$|E
5|$|The Khitan spoken {{language}} is most {{closely related to}} the Mongolic language family; some broader definitions of the Mongolic family include Khitan as a member. More broadly, Khitan is an Altaic language, although scholars are divided on the question whether the Altaic is a true language <b>family</b> <b>or</b> linguistic area in which originally distinct languages have influenced each other over a long period. Khitan shares some terms with the Altaic but non-Mongolic Turkic spoken by the Uighur peoples, who shared the steppes of North Asia with the Khitans for several hundred years.|$|E
