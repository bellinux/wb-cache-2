50|$|The PLA {{began to}} search for a {{successor}} for the Type 78 in the 1990s. The older, 1950s-era equipment began to show its age. The Type 98 was revealed with a garrison unit in Macao in 1999, while some elite units began to receive the weapon after 2000. The design makes the accurate delivery of a 120 mm multi-purpose high-explosive or <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> <b>projectile</b> with negligible recoil possible. The weapon can be tripod- or shoulder-fired.|$|E

50|$|Originally, most MBTs {{relied on}} steel armour {{to defend against}} various threats. As newer threats emerged, however, the {{defensive}} systems used by MBTs had to evolve to counter them. One of the first new developments {{was the use of}} explosive reactive armour (ERA), developed by Israel in the early 1980s to defend against the shaped-charge warheads of modern anti-tank guided missiles and other such <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) <b>projectiles.</b> This technology was subsequently adopted and expanded upon by the United States and the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|Starting from July 1991 T-72 {{modernization}} {{programs were}} {{implemented by the}} Bumarcombine which had been producing T-72s under Soviet license. The modernized main battle tank was designated PT-91 Twardy. In 1993 the Polish Defense Ministry ordered 20 PT-91 tanks {{to be used for}} field trials and Armed Forces tests.The main battle tank's protection from <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) <b>projectiles</b> and missiles was increased by new Erawa dynamic armor developed by the Poland Military-Technical Institute which consists of 394 tiles with explosives, detonating in case of a direct hit. The Twardy used steel anti-HEAT screens instead of the rubber used on the T-72. The Erawa's main difference from the Soviet analogs is that Erawa's containers fit almost without gaps while on the Soviet modernised T-72 the gaps reach 10 - 15 mm noticeably decreasing defense effectiveness.|$|R
50|$|The 90mm GT-2 gun, which fires fin-stabilised high-explosive (HE) and <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) <b>projectiles,</b> is {{heavier than}} that {{mounted in the}} Saladin and {{provides}} the Eland with a very potent form of armament, considering its small size and speed. It weighs 380 kg and has a double baffle muzzle brake. With the muzzle brake, it measures 4.1 metres in length. Low-angled rifling {{is used in the}} barrel. The breech of the gun is semi-automatic and fitted with a vertical sliding wedge breech block. The firing mechanism utilises a mechanical firing pin which was prone to sticking and malfunction in dusty climates. There is also a recoil control mechanism consisting of a single cylinder with a constant stress spring and a hydropneumatic recuperator designed to return the GT-2 to its original firing position. This process entailed releasing oil into a nitrogen reservoir as the gun recoiled upon firing. Oil levels and the nitrogen pressure had to be monitored frequently; if neither was sufficient turret crews were forced to physically manhandle their gun back into position.|$|R
50|$|Starting from July 1991 T-72 {{modernization}} {{programs were}} {{implemented by the}} Bumarcombine which had been producing T-72s under Soviet license. The modernized main battle tank was designated PT-91 Twardy. From base modification it differs in increased protection, fire control system and engine. In 1993 the Polish Defense Ministry ordered 20 PT-91 tanks {{to be used for}} field trials and Armed Forces tests.The main battle tank's protection from <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) <b>projectiles</b> and missiles is increased by the new Erawa dynamic armor developed by the Poland Military-Technical Institute. This protection consists of 394 tiles with explosives, detonating in case of a direct hit. The tiles cover 9 m2 on the tank. 108 tiles are placed on the turret, 118 on the hull and 84 on each side's anti-HEAT screens. The Twardy uses steel anti-HEAT screens instead of the rubber used on the T-72. Erawa's main difference from the Soviet analogs is that Erawa's containers fit almost without gaps while on the Soviet modernized T-72 gaps reach 10-15 mm noticeably decreasing defense effectiveness. There are two Erawa modifications: Erawa-1 and -2, differing in weight of the explosives.|$|R
50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the jet of a copper-lined shaped charge is not molten, {{although}} it is heated to about 500 Â°C. This misconception {{is due to the}} metal's fluid-like behaviour, which is caused by the massive pressures produced during the explosives detonation causing the metal to flow plastically. When used in the <b>anti-tank</b> role, a <b>projectile</b> that uses a shaped-charge warhead is known by the acronym HEAT (<b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank).</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>High-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warhead {{capable of}} {{penetrating}} 680 mm of Rolled homogeneous armour(RHA). Warhead uses a stand-off probe, {{which is located}} on the ogive of the projectile, to penetrate the armour.|$|R
50|$|The 2A46 {{can fire}} armour-piercing fin-stabilised {{discarding}} sabot (APFSDS), <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) and <b>high-explosive</b> fragmentation (HEF) projectiles. The ammunition for the 2A46 gun is in two pieces: the projectile is loaded first, {{followed by a}} separate propellant charge.|$|R
5000|$|Developed by Instalaza {{for use by}} the Spanish Army, the M65 was an {{improved}} version of the M20 [...] "Super Bazooka". It used {{an improved}} ignition method and new ammunition types. The available ammunition used were the CHM65 (<b>High-Explosive</b> <b>Anti-Tank),</b> MB66 (Dual-Purpose), and FIM66 (Smoke) shells.|$|R
50|$|<b>High-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warheads (HEAT for short) were {{developed}} during the Second World War as a munition made of an explosive shaped charge that uses the Munroe effect to create a very high-velocity partial stream of metal {{in a state of}} superplasticity, and used to penetrate solid vehicle armour.|$|R
50|$|During {{the initial}} hours of warfare, some under-equipped ROK Army border units used 105 mm howitzers as {{anti-tank}} guns {{to stop the}} tanks heading the KPA columns, firing <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> ammunition (HEAT) over open sights to good effect; at the war's start, the ROK Army had 91 such guns, but lost most to the invaders.|$|R
50|$|The {{launcher}} {{carries a}} tandem warhead. The precursor <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) warhead penetrates armour or other obstacles (reinforced concrete, masonry, etc.). The main warhead creates a fine explosive cloud and takes {{into the interior}} through the hole, pierced by the precursor charge. Detonation of the main warhead explosive boasts a multiple effects (high-explosive and incendiary).|$|R
50|$|<b>High-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> rounds {{caused a}} {{revolution}} in anti-tank warfare {{when they were first}} introduced in the later stages of World War II. One infantryman could effectively destroy any existing tank with a handheld weapon, thereby dramatically altering the nature of mobile operations. During World War II, weapons using HEAT warheads were termed hollow charge or shape charge warheads.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{construction}} {{details of the}} armour remain a secret, it {{has been described as}} being made by sandwiching composite panels between rolled homogeneous armour (RHA). The number of layers may vary based on the user requirements. This armour is able to defeat armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) and <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warhead (HEAT) rounds and is known to defeat armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS).|$|R
50|$|Tank {{ammunition}} {{was developed}} in WWI as tanks first appeared on the battlefield. However, as tank-on-tank warfare developed (including the development of anti-tank artillery), more specialized forms of ammunition were developed such as <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warheads and armor-piercing discarding sabot rounds. The development of shaped charges has {{had a significant impact}} on anti-tank ammunition design, now common on both tank-fire ammunition and in anti-tank missiles.|$|R
25|$|A bazooka is a shoulder-fired, man-portable {{recoilless}} rocket {{anti-tank weapon}} {{that features a}} solid rocket motor for propulsion, allowing for high explosive (HE) and <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine. The bazooka was co-invented in February 1942 by Edward Uhl, then a lieutenant in the United States Army, and Colonel Leslie Skinner.|$|R
50|$|The light tank variant is {{armed with}} a fully stabilised 105mm rifled gun. The 105mm rounds carried consist of armour {{piercing}} fin stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS), high explosive (HE), and <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) rounds, and Chinese 105mm laser beam riding guidance anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM). The 105mm missile offers the capability to engage shore targets whilst still swimming at sea, where conventional ammunition would perform poorly due to the motion of sea waves.|$|R
50|$|The <b>anti-tank</b> <b>projectile</b> is fin-stabilized, and is {{propelled}} by the rocker motor to {{a speed of}} about 170 meters per second. It is able to penetrate 300mm of steel armor, and the sighting systemâs accuracy allows to hit 1 mÂ² target {{at a distance of}} 200 meters.|$|R
50|$|After 1966, AMX-13s in French service were up-gunned with a 90mm F3 medium {{pressure}} gun firing more effective <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) munitions; this variant was designated AMX-13/90. The F3 {{was similar to}} the DEFA D921/F1 low pressure gun developed for the Panhard AML-90, and even utilized the same ammunition, though it possessed a significantly higher muzzle velocity. By the late 1960s, an export model of the AMX-13 was also available with an even larger 105mm gun.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} two types of rockets {{produced}} was a <b>High-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warhead (HEAT) round known as âBuzogÃ¡nyâ (mace). With 4.2 kg of explosive, this shaped charge was capable of penetrating 300 mm of armour or concrete and destroy any type of heavy tank from a maximum distance of 1200 m. A high explosive (HE) projectile round was also available for use in an anti-personnel role referred to as âZÃ¡porâ (rainfall, shower). Both types were spin-stabilized.|$|R
50|$|Type 63A {{introduces}} {{an enlarged}} welded turret replacing the original Type 63 turret, the modernised Type 63A utilises the dual-way stabilised 105 mm rifled gun replacining the 85 mm gun. The 105 mm rifled gun, fires armour piercing fin stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS), high explosive (HE), and <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) ammunitions, with 45 rounds carried inside the vehicle. APFSDS round penetrates 400 mm steel armour or destroy a reinforced concrete bunker {{a distance of}} 2,000 m.|$|R
50|$|For {{the base}} model M1 Abrams, Steven J. Zaloga gives a frontal armor {{estimate}} of 350 mm vs armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot (APFSDS) and 700 mm vs <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warhead (HEAT) in M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank 1982-1992 (1993). In M1 Abrams vs T-72 Ural (2009), he uses Soviet estimates of 470 mm vs APFSDS and 650 mm vs HEAT for the base model Abrams. He also gives the Soviet {{estimates for the}} M1A1, 600 mm vs APFSDS, and 700 mm vs HEAT.|$|R
5000|$|Toophan (ØªÙÙØ§Ù, meaning [...] "Typhoon" [...] in Persian) is {{a series}} of Iranian {{anti-tank}} missiles. Toophan 1 is a reverse-engineered copy of the US military BGM-71 TOW missile. The Toophan-1's payload is a 3.6 kg <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warhead that can penetrate up to 550mm of steel armor. The range is 3,850m, the top speed 310 m/s. The manufacturer is the Aerospace Industries Organization of Iran, which has produced the missile since 2000. Several other variants are also built with more penetration power.|$|R
50|$|During the {{development}} stage, engineers {{opted for a}} license on the NATO standard Royal Ordnance L7 105mm cannon. Japan only produced the barrel under licence, developing an indigenous mantlet, breech and recoil system. The full length of the cannon was 5,592 mm, for a total weight of 2,800 kg. Initially the main gun only used APDS (Armour-Piercing Discarding Sabot) and HEP (High Explosive Plastic) as its primary ammunition. Later it was modified to fire APFSDS (Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot) and HEAT-MP (<b>High-Explosive</b> <b>Anti-Tank</b> Multi-Purpose) shells as well.|$|R
50|$|The {{opposite}} {{technique to}} KE-penetrators uses chemical energy penetrators. There {{are two types}} of these shells in use: <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) and <b>high-explosive</b> squash head (HESH). They have been widely used against armour in the past and still have a role but are less effective against modern composite armour, such as Chobham as used on main battle tanks today. Main battle tanks usually use KE-penetrators, while HEAT is mainly found in missile systems that are shoulder-launched or vehicle-mounted, and HESH is usually favored for fortification demolition.|$|R
50|$|The {{widespread}} {{introduction of}} <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warheads {{during the second}} half of World War II led to lightweight infantry-carried anti-tank weapons such as the Panzerfaust, which could destroy some types of tanks. Tanks in the Cold War were designed with these weapons in mind, and led to greatly improved armour types during the 1960s, especially composite armour. Improved engines, transmissions and suspensions allowed tanks of this period to grow larger. Aspects of gun technology changed significantly as well, with advances in shell design and aiming technology.|$|R
2500|$|In 1964, the NII-24 {{research}} bureau started {{design work}} on an improved 3UBM6 anti-tank round. [...] In 1967 the 3BM6 hyper-velocity armour-piercing discarding-sabot round (HVAPDS) entered service: At a range of 2,000m, it could penetrate 290mm of flat armour, or 145mm of armour angled at 60 degrees from the vertical.

50|$|For any <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> mine or grenade to be {{effective}} against armour, it must sit squarely on to the armour, so that the high-velocity jet of metal punches through the armour at a ninety degree angle. A way of making sure this happens is to place the charge onto the armour by hand. However, this puts the participant into grave danger from defensive fire from the tank and other enemies. A thrown version would be more versatile, {{but it would be}} hard to ensure the ninety degree angle.|$|R

50|$|Likewise, the Germans, Italians, and Japanese had {{in service}} many {{obsolescent}} infantry guns, short-barreled, low-velocity artillery pieces capable of {{direct and indirect}} fire and intended for infantry support, similar in tactical role to mortars; generally an infantry battalion had a battery of four or six. <b>High-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> rounds for these old infantry guns made them semi-useful anti-tank guns, particularly the German 150 mm guns (the Japanese 70 mm Type 92 battalion gun and Italian 65 mm mountain gun also had HEAT rounds available for them by 1944 {{but they were not}} very effective).|$|R
5000|$|The Flak 18 {{was mounted}} on a {{cruciform}} gun carriage. A simple-to-operate [...] "semi-automatic" [...] loading system ejected fired shells, allowing it to be reloaded by simply inserting a new shell into a tray. The gun would then fire, recoil, and, during the return stroke, the empty case would be thrown backward by levers, a cam would then engage and recock the gun. This resulted in firing rates of 15 to 20 rounds a minute, which was better than similar weapons of the era. High explosive ammunition was used against aircraft and personnel, andarmour-piercing and <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> against tanks and other armored vehicles.|$|R
