25|$|The role {{of forests}} in the {{national}} economy and in ecology was further emphasized in the 1988 National Forest Policy, which focused on ensuring environmental stability, restoring the ecological balance, and preserving the remaining forests. Other objectives of the policy were meeting the need for fuelwood, fodder, and small timber for rural and tribal people while recognising the need to actively involve local people {{in the management of}} forest resources. Also in 1988, the Forest Conservation Act of 1980 was amended to facilitate stricter conservation measures. A new target was to increase the forest cover to 33% of India's land area from the then-official estimate of 23%. In June 1990, the central government adopted resolutions that combined forest science with social forestry, that is, taking the sociocultural traditions of the local people into. The cumulative area afforested during the 1951-91 period was nearly 179,000 square kilometres. However, despite large-scale tree planting programmes, forestry is one arena in which India has actually regressed since independence. Annual <b>fellings</b> at about four times the growth rate are a major cause. Widespread pilfering by villagers for firewood and fodder also represents a major decrement. In addition, the 1988 National Forest Policy noted, the forested area has been shrinking as a result of land cleared for farming and development programmes.|$|E

This early exposure to the practical side of sawmilling and forest management would become very valuable years later, when he had his own sawmilling business. In an era of indiscriminate felling of trees, he stressed the risks inherent in upsetting the balance of nature by felling one or two species of tree only, pointing out that such selective <b>fellings</b> would undermine the principle of removing mature growth to improve conditions for young growth in the forest.

50|$|Planted ancient {{woodland}} (PAWS) is {{an ancient}} woodland site where the native species have been partially or wholly replaced with a non locally native species (usually but not always conifers). These woodlands typically have a plantation structure, with even aged crops {{of one or two}} species planted for commercial purposes. Many of these ancient woodlands were converted to conifer plantations following war-time <b>fellings.</b> PAWS sites, whilst not being of such high ecological value as ASNW, typically contain remnants of semi-natural species where shading has been less intense, and restoration of more semi-natural structures through gradual thinning is often possible. Since the recognition of the ecological and historical values of ancient woodland, PAWS restoration has been a priority amongst many woodland owners and governmental and non-governmental agencies, and has been supported by various grant schemes. Some restored PAWS sites are now practically indistinguishable from ASNW. There is no formal method for reclassifying restored PAWS as ASNW, although some woodland managers now use the acronym RPAWS for a restored site.|$|E

The aim of this forest resource study was to analyse the impacts on the European forest resources under the level of <b>fellings</b> needed to fulfil the derived roundwood demand according to two scenarios as provided by the market modelling project within the EFSOS framework. Thus <b>fellings</b> and removals presented in this study cannot be identified with a wood supply forecast in economic terms. The study includes the forest available for wood supply (FAWS) in geographical Europe, i. e. from Ireland to the Ural mountains and from {{the northern tip of}} Lapland to the southern border of Turkey. The model outcomes are based on assumptions about the increase in FAWS as well as unchanged forest management regimes (e. g. rotation period, thinning intensity, afforestation), and growth of stands ratios between felling and removals over the analysed period. Although removals are assumed to rise significantly, the results as presented sketch large and increasing forest resources in Europe. The growing stock increases under the baseline scenario from 51 billion m 3 o. b. to 63 billion m 3 o. b. in 2040, whereas the net annual increment declines only slightly from the current 1. 2 billion m 3 o. b o. b to 1. 15 billion m 3 o. b. in 2040. The FAWS area is assumed to decrease from 335 million ha to 329 million ha by the year 2040, in the base scenario. In the alternative scenario the forest area is expected to increase to 343 million ha. The market model outcomes projected a fast increase in required <b>fellings</b> in the current outlook study. This demand for <b>fellings</b> on FAWS is foreseen to increase from 643 million m 3 o. b. per year in 2000 to 847 million m 3 o. b. per year in 2020 in the baseline scenario (1014 million m 3 o. b. per year in the alternative). This, together with an approach that dynamically simulates age class development, shows that annual availability of roundwood may be hampered after 2020. In the baseline scenario the actual <b>fellings</b> in 2036 - 2040 were about 2 % lower than the required <b>fellings,</b> whereas in the alternative scenario the difference was about 11 % per year. In reality market mechanisms will take care of this difference, by adjusting prices, forestry management and especially trade, considering the legal restriction, which assure sustainable forestry management.

40|$|Estimation of {{the amount}} of wood that could {{potentially}} be harvested in a country can be accomplished using several approaches.

However, this indicator {{does not take into account}} the actual age-class distribution of the forest and possible harvesting constraints. More elaborate systems can estimate Annual Allowable Cut or long-term maximum supply based on the actual age-class distribution, management guidelines and existing policies. For most approaches, the maximum theoretical (physical) potential is reduced to a “realistic” potential by applying technical, ecological and economic constraints. These inventory-based estimates of potentials can then be translated to quantities available to consumers on the market, taking into account differences in measurement methods between NFIs and wood market analysts, losses during felling, forwarding and transport, and correcting for unregistered <b>fellings...</b>|$|E

40|$|Sustainable forest {{management}} requires that <b>fellings</b> do not exceed increments {{in the medium}} term, once natural mortality is taken into account.

The amount of small-scale mortality losses is often neglected and cannot be directly estimated from available inventory data. From literature sources and using two alternative approaches, mortality losses could amount to 31. 1 - 36. 2 % of gross annual increments. <b>Fellings</b> would therefore remove 57. 7 - 62. 6 % of net annual increments of Italian forests, well above what often reported and not far away from the EU 15 average.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the <b>fellings</b> and {{removals}} and their dimension distributions in first commercial thinnings in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands growing on drained peatlands, when the cuttings are carried out at different stages of thinning maturity. The reference for standard thinning maturity was defined as in the present guidelines for silviculture on upland sites in non-industrial, privately owned pine forests in Finland. Experimental and/or simulated thinnings were applied in altogether fifteen stands representing a wide range in site productivity, climate, and time elapsed since first ditching, and premature (7 cases), mature (11), and over-mature (15) stages for thinning. The average stemwood volumes of <b>fellings</b> were 51, 69, and 92 m 3 ha- 1 and those of harvest removals 36, 59, and 84 m 3 ha- 1 for premature, mature, and over-mature cases, respectively. The removals from stands mature and over-mature for thinning were large enough to enable a commercially profitable harvesting operation in most cases, unlike those from the premature stands where the <b>fellings</b> were barely harvestable and consisted of clearly smaller stems. Considering the obvious trends of increasing supply and simultaneously decreasing price competitiveness of pine pulpwood, our results do not support early thinning unless absolutely necessary from the silvicultural point-of-view. Retarding the thinning until the stage when thinning maturity criteria are actually met, i. e. till stand dominant height of ca. 15 m or even further, would result in markedly better harvesting profitability and hence enhance the implementation of thinnings as a part of the best management practices of peatland stands...|$|E
