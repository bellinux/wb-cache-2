50|$|In early designs, {{machines}} {{were made with}} square wooden frames with holes drilled in {{the top and bottom}} through which a skein was threaded, wrapped around wooden levers that spanned the holes, enabling the adjustment of tension. The problem with this design is that when increasing the tension of the skein, turning the lever became nigh impossible because of the friction caused by the contact made between the wood of the lever and the wood of the frame. This problem was solved simply with the addition of metal washers inserted in the holes of the frames and fastened either with tenons or rims which enabled greater control over the machine’s tension and the maximization of its power without sacrificing the integrity of the frame. Further design modifications that became standard include combining the two separate spring frames into a single unit to increase durability and stability, the addition of a padded <b>heel</b> <b>block</b> to stop the recoil of the machine, the development of formulae to determine the appropriate engine size (see Construction & Measurements below), and a ratcheting trigger mechanism that made it quicker to fire the machine. Marsden suggests that all of these initial developments occurred in fairly rapid succession, potentially over the span of just a few decades, because the deficiencies in design were fairly obvious problems. Thereon, a gradual refinement over the succeeding centuries provided the adjustments given in the chart below. Marsden’s description of torsion machine development follows the general course that Heron of Alexandria lays out, but the Greek writer does not give any dates, either. Marsden’s chart below gives his best approximations of the dates of machine development.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to check out the {{performance}} and durability of vulcanized Jaipur rubber feet in tropical areas of the developing world. Forty-one MUKTI and 40 NISHA feet were followed for 16 (8 – 17) months. The user compliance was high and nearly all were satisfied. Failure of the prosthetic foot with the need for exchange at the end of the study amounted to 27 % (22 / 81), which is equivalent to a mixed series of rubber feet previously reported (Jensen et al. 2006 b). Failures were mostly related to skin fracture and gliding between sponge rubber layers of the <b>heel</b> <b>block...</b>|$|E

40|$|Mild, {{temporary}} {{reduction of}} symptoms from plantar fasciitis {{have been reported}} {{with the use of}} high heeled shoes (i. e. cowboy boots, ladies pumps). However, little is known on how heel elevation may contribute to a decrease in the pain and inflammation. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify strain in the plantar aponeurosis in cadaveric feet with the use of various heel elevation configurations. An in vitro method that simulated "static" stance was used to determine the loading characteristics of the plantar aponeurosis (n = 12). Heel elevation was evaluated with blocks placed beneath the heel and with a contoured platform that simulated the arch profile of a shoe at three different heel heights (2. 0, 4. 0, 6. 0 cm) with a level plane serving as the control. Strain in the plantar aponeurosis decreased with elevations of the heel that simulated the arch profile of a shoe at load levels (337, 450 N) (P < 0. 05). Elevations of the <b>heel</b> with <b>blocks</b> did not significantly affect strain in the plantar aponeurosis (P < 0. 05). Contrasting results of some specimen limbs compared with the overall means suggests that the influence of heel elevation on loading of the plantar aponeurosis may be dependent on individual variation and foot structure differences. Therefore, clinicians should be cautious in recommending heel elevation as a treatment for plantar fasciitis since some subjects may not achieve the desired decrease in plantar aponeurosis strain...|$|R

In the second quarter, after another touchdown by the Deacons, the Tar Heels once again answered and the teams were tied 14-14 at the half. In the third quarter the Tar Heels took their first lead with a 35-yard field goal. The Deacons wouldn't answer until early in the fourth quarter on a Swank field goal. They took their final lead on a Skinner pass of 39-yards. Down by a touchdown, the Tar Heels drove to scoring range, however, an errant pass on the final play of the game was intercepted by Jon Abbate to seal the win for the Deacons, 24-17. With the win the team was 7-1 for only the third time in school history.|$|R
40|$|Autophagy, a "self-eating" {{cellular}} process, has dual {{roles in}} promoting and suppressing tumor growth, depending on cellular context. PTP 4 A 3 /PRL- 3, a plasma membrane and endosomal phosphatase, promotes multiple oncogenic processes including cell proliferation, invasion, and cancer metastasis. In this study, we demonstrate that PTP 4 A 3 accumulates in autophagosomes upon inhibition of autophagic degradation. Expression of PTP 4 A 3 enhances PIK 3 C 3 -BECN 1 -dependent autophagosome formation and accelerates LC 3 -I to LC 3 -II conversion in an ATG 5 -dependent manner. PTP 4 A 3 overexpression also enhances {{the degradation of}} SQSTM 1, a key autophagy substrate. These functions of PTP 4 A 3 are dependent on its catalytic activity and prenylation-dependent membrane association. These results suggest that PTP 4 A 3 functions to promote canonical autophagy flux. Unexpectedly, following autophagy activation, PTP 4 A 3 serves as a novel autophagic substrate, thereby establishing a negative feedback-loop that {{may be required to}} fine-tune autophagy activity. Functionally, PTP 4 A 3 utilizes the autophagy pathway to promote cell growth, concomitant with the activation of AKT. Clinically, from the largest ovarian cancer data set (GSE 9899, n = 285) available in GEO, high levels of expression of both PTP 4 A 3 and autophagy genes significantly predict poor prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. These studies reveal a critical role of autophagy in PTP 4 A 3 -driven cancer progression, suggesting that autophagy could be a potential Achilles <b>heel</b> to <b>block</b> PTP 4 A 3 -mediated tumor progression in stratified patients with high expression of both PTP 4 A 3 and autophagy genes...|$|R
40|$|In {{structural}} mechanics {{there are several}} occasions where a linearized formulation of the original nonlinear problem reduces considerably the computational effort for the response analysis. In a broader sense, a linearized formulation {{can be viewed as}} a first-order expansion of the dynamic equilibrium of the system about a `static¿ configuration; yet caution should be exercised when identifying the `correct¿ static configuration. This paper uses as a case study the rocking response of a rigid block stepping on viscoelastic supports, whose non-linear dynamics is the subject of the companion paper, and elaborates on the challenge of identifying the most appropriate static configuration around which a first-order expansion will produce the most dependable results in each regime of motion. For the regime when the <b>heel</b> of the <b>block</b> separates, a revised set of linearized equations is presented, which is an improvement to the unconservative equations published previously in the literature. The associated eigenvalues demonstrate that the characteristics of the foundation do not affect the rocking motion of the <b>block</b> once the <b>heel</b> separates...|$|R
5000|$|As {{time went}} on, {{stiletto}} heels would become known {{more for their}} erotic nature than {{for their ability to}} make height. Stiletto heels are a common fetish item. As a fashion item, their popularity has changed over time. After an initial wave of popularity in the 1950s, they reached their most refined shape in the early 1960s, when the toes of the shoes which bore them became as slender and elongated as the stiletto heels themselves. As a result of the overall sharpness of outline, it was customary for women to refer to the whole shoe as a [...] "stiletto", not just the heel, via synecdoche (pars pro toto). Although they officially faded from the scene after the Beatle era began, their popularity continued at street level, and women stubbornly refused to give them up even after they could no longer readily find them in the mainstream shops. A version of the stiletto heel was reintroduced in 1974 by Manolo Blahnik, who dubbed his [...] "new" [...] heel the [...] "Needle". Similar heels were stocked at the big Biba store in London, by Russell & Bromley and by smaller boutiques. Old, unsold stocks of pointed-toe stilettos and contemporary efforts to replicate them (lacking the true stiletto heel because of changes in the way heels were by then being mass-produced) were sold in street fashion markets and became popular with punks and with other fashion [...] "tribes" [...] of the late 1970s until supplies of the inspirational original styles dwindled in the early 1980s. Subsequently, round-toe shoes with slightly thicker (sometimes cone-shaped) semi-stiletto heels, often very high in an attempt to convey slenderness were frequently worn at the office with wide-shouldered power suits. The style survived through much of the 1980s but almost completely disappeared during the 1990s, when professional and college-age women took to wearing shoes with thick, <b>block</b> <b>heels.</b> The slender stiletto heel staged a major comeback after 2000 when young women adopted the style for dressing up office wear or adding a feminine touch to casual wear, like jeans.|$|R
