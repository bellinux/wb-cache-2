50|$|Once {{the bill}} was nearly {{complete}} Tirpitz started a round of visits to obtain support. First he visited the former Chancellor and elder statesman, Prince Bismarck. Armed with the announcement that the Kaiser intended to name the next ship launched Furst Bismarck, he persuaded the former chancellor, who had been dismissed from office for disagreement with Wilhelm II, to modestly support the proposals. Tirpitz now visited the King of Saxony, the Prince Regent of Bavaria, the Grand Duke of Baden and Oldenburg and the councils of the Hanseatic towns. On 19 October the draft bill {{was sent to the}} printers for presentation to the Reichstag. Tirpitz's approach was to be as accommodating with the deputies as he could. He was patient and good humoured, proceeding on the assumption that if everything was <b>explained</b> <b>carefully,</b> then the deputies would naturally be convinced. Groups were invited to private meetings to discuss the bill. Tours of ships and shipyards were arranged. The Kaiser and Chancellor stressed that the fleet was only intended for protection of Germany, but so that even a first class power might think twice before attacking. Highlights from a letter Prince Bismarck wrote were read out in the Reichstag, though not mentioning passages where he expressed reservations. Papers were circulated showing the relative size of foreign fleets, and how much Germany had fallen behind, particularly when considering the great power of her army compared to others.|$|E

40|$|From the reviews: The book is, {{in spite}} of the author's more modest claims, an {{introductory}} survey of main developments in those disciplines which were particularly important in Medieval Islamic mathematics [...] . No knowledge of mathematics (or of the history of mathematics) beyond normal high-school level is presupposed, and everything required beyond that (be it Apollonian theory of conics or the definitions of celestial circles) is <b>explained</b> <b>carefully</b> and clearly. Scattered throughout the work are a number of lucid remarks on the character of Islamic mathematics or of mathematical work in general. The book will hence not only be an excellent textbook for the teaching of the history of mathematics but also for the liberal art aspect of mathematics teaching in general. - Jens Høyrup, Mathematical Reviews [...] . as a textbook, this work is highly commendable [...] .

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} high-precision {{calculations}} in perturbative {{quantum field theory}}. In conjunction with detailed experimental measurements, perturbative quantum field theory provides the quantitative framework with which much of modern particle physics is understood. The results of three new theoretical calculations are presented. The first is a definitive resolution of a recent controversy involving the interaction of a muon with a magnetic field. Specifically, the light-by-light scattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is shown to be of positive sign, thereby decreasing the discrepancy between theory and experiment. Despite this adjustment to the theoretical prediction, the remaining discrepancy might be a subtle signature of new kinds of particles. The second calculation involves the energy levels of a bound state formed from two charged particles of arbitrary masses. By employing recently developed mass expansion techniques, new classes of solutions are obtained for problems {{in a field of}} particle physics with a very rich history. The third calculation provides an improved prediction for the decay of a top quark. In order to obtain this result, a large class of multiloop integrals has been solved for the first time. Top quark decay is just one member of a family of interesting physical processes to which these new results apply. Since specialized calculational techniques are essential ingredients in all three calculations, they are motivated and <b>explained</b> <b>carefully</b> in this thesis. These techniques, once automated with symbolic computational software, have recently opened avenues of solution {{to a wide variety of}} important problems in particle physics...|$|E

40|$|Given their multidimensional missions, {{combining}} economic, {{social and}} sometimes political dimensions, FTOs {{have been proposed}} quite early as examples of “social enterprise” (SE). Such link {{has been made in}} a particularly explicit way in the United Kingdom, by both academics (e. g. Martin and Osberg, 2007; Nicholls, 2006) and practitioners. Following Dart (2004), the trend for FTOs to depict themselves (and to be depicted) as SEs probably stems from a research of legitimacy towards an environment that promotes values of entrepreneurship and innovation. However, if FTOs are considered as obvious examples of SE, there still needs to be <b>explained</b> <b>carefully</b> why this is the case, and to what extent. Is it the involvement in FT that makes the enterprises “social”, or is it a set of particular organisational characteristics shared by most FTOs, or is it a combination of both? If the fact of “doing Fair Trade” is not a sufficient criterion to generate a SE dynamics – as we believe it –, then what is it in FTOs that makes these organisations eligible as SEs? The answers to these questions are closely linked to the framework used to define SE. While we try to consider different conceptualisations of SE in our analysis (part 1), we pay a special attention to the “multiple goal” and “multiple stakeholders” features put forward by the authors of the “EMES network”. In part 2, we recall the basics of the FT concept and the historical evolution of the movement. We then present our empirical data on FTOs in four European regions. Finally, we confront these data to some of the SE features identified in the literature (part 3). In this analysis, we particularly try to examine to what extent FTOs pursue multiple goals and involve multiple stakeholders, and how such organisational characteristics could be linked {{to each other and to}} other features such as resources, age and size.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 66 - 67). This {{thesis is}} a study {{of one of the}} leading sectors in the Lebanese economy, namely its banking sector. Actually it is an attempt to explain the strength of the Lebanese banking system in spite of the permanent political instability in general and after the Taif agreement in particular. It therefore analyzes the relationship between the Central Bank and the commercial banks, and the policies and laws that allow the banking sector to prosper and the state’s actions to protect the banking system. The liberal economic ideology prevalent in Lebanon is also central to the explanation. This paper analyzes how bank characteristics and the overall financial environment affect the performance of commercial banks and their relationship with the Lebanese Central Bank. Specifically, {{the purpose of the study}} is to give a closer look to the relationships between profitability and the banks’ characteristics, after controlling for economic and financial structural indicators under the conditions of the Lebanese Central Bank. A variety of Lebanese banks were chosen, concentrating on the most profitable and the most effective banks in Lebanon. The intention is actually to make the decision about the important determinants of performance. In this way, the paper extends the literature in several ways (Abelson, 1983). Politics in Lebanon has a major impact on the performance of the financial system. However, despite this impact, the banking system in Lebanon remains active and effective. Thus, despite the fact that the banking system in Lebanon is highly affected by politics, it remains to maintain solidarity and effectiveness. For this purpose, an entire set of internal characteristics is examined as determinants of banks’ net non-interest margin and productivity. These include bank size, liquidity, loans, deposits and some others. Also, while studying the relationship between banks’ internal characteristics and activity, I was able to detect the direct impact of external factors, such as macroeconomic inflation and exchange rates. It was apparent from the results and the regression and correlation analysis that the ‘Return on Equity’ (ROE) of commercial banks is highly influenced by the independent banking variables determined. The existing relationship is both negative and positive. While some variables affect the profitability negatively, other variables affect it positively (Abelson, 1983). The following empirical analysis allows me to highlight the relationship between banking characteristics and performance measures in commercial Lebanese banks. As a start, the Lebanese commercial banks profitability measures react positively to the increases in capital and loan ratios. This result is in harmony with previous studies. In addition, it shows that optimal capital ratios and loan portfolios are essential factors for determining the performance of Lebanese commercial banks, in addition to other factors such as customers’ deposits, non-interest earning assets and banks’ profits. Moreover, I noted that liquidity factors are even more vital for the determination of bank performance (Abelson, 1983, p. 15). The 1975 - 1990 war destroyed most of the country’s economy. However, major economic changes accompanied the demographic changes in Lebanon and, despite this war the banking system remained powerful in Lebanon. Finally, it should be recognized that the range of this paper is limited as several Lebanese commercial banks are not included and several interesting questions were left unanswered. These questions analyze more fully the interaction between the political and the banking system in Lebanon and show how banking stability could be influenced by the political stability of Lebanon. Also, because of the size of the sample and many missing observations, the results should be <b>explained</b> <b>carefully.</b> As has been the case of many recent studies, the results are not very robust and may be responsive to the type of measure of performance used. 1 Thus, in general, the profitability determinants of Lebanese commercial banks are various and numerous in nature. The loans, size, growth, exchange rates, inflation, deposits, liquidity can have a direct impact on the profitability level. However, the ROE level is not limited to those variables. Other variables do have a direct impact on the profitability as well. As already noted, such variables seem to be Lebanese politics and state policies as well as other new economic and competitive regulations. 1 CD-ROM + 1 bound copy: 67 leaves; 31 cm. available at RNL...|$|E
