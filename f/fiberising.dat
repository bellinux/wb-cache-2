For example, trees produce paper, {{which can be}} recycled into low-energy production cellulose (<b>fiberised</b> paper) insulation, then used as an energy-saving device in the ceiling of a home for 40 years, saving 2,000 times the fossil-fuel energy used in its production. After 40 years the cellulose fibers are replaced and the old fibers are disposed of, possibly incinerated. All inputs and outputs are considered for all the phases of the life cycle.|$|R

The paper concludes that many technologies now available for shaping light in fibre, supplemented by an increasing array of <b>fiberised</b> components; leverage of telecom technology and concepts into new and emerging fields represents an important enabler allowing shaping on ns, ps and fs timescales; shaping at high power levels particularly attractive {{for a host of}} scientific and industrial processing applications and shaping of the spatial mode profile represents an interesting further source control possibility...|$|R
40|$|Silica {{nanowires}} (SN) manufactured from {{optical fibers}} using a top-down approach {{have in the}} recent years attracted much attention because of their use for photonic applications and sensors. Until 2003, surface roughness and inhomogeneity appear to have limited the use of SNs for optical applications. SN and sub-wavelength wires offer a number of unique optical and mechanical properties, including: 1) Large evanescent fields; 2) High nonlinearity; 3) Extreme flexibility and configurability; and 4) Low-loss interconnection to other optical fibers and <b>fiberised</b> components. In fact SN are fabricated by adiabatically stretching optical fibers and thus preserve the original dimensions of the optical fiber at their input and output allowing the manipulation of a single nanowire without the expensive instrumentation typical of the nanoscience and nanotechnology worlds...|$|R
40|$|A new {{instrument}} for simultaneous display of an en-face {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) image and of a confocal image (similar with that produced by the scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO)) for the retina in vivo is demonstrated. The system {{is based on a}} <b>fiberised</b> OCT configuration, where a separate bulk optical confocal receiver is introduced between the transversal galvanometer scanner and the OCT fiber arm. Criteria for presenting the two images are discussed. These address the resulting impact on the quality of each image as result of differences in the two imaging techniques, low coherence interferometry and confocal imaging. The transversal and depth pixel size are governed by different principles and consequently are generally different. Additionally, the OCT image is disturbed by Doppler shifts introduced by the transversal scanning and speckle...|$|R
40|$|A remote <b>fiberised</b> low-coherence {{interferometric}} sensor {{has been used}} to measure the refractive index of air. The relative humidity, temperature, pressure or carbon dioxide content may be determined from the measurement of the refractive index of air if the values of the other parameters are known. The sensor works linearly, for example, over the full range of humidity and does not suffer from aging or hysteresis. This maintenance-free sensor has a relative accuracy of 1. 6 % with a fast response time. The relative sensitivity of the sensor to changes in the values of the other parameters influencing the refractive index of air has also been deduced. The sensor is designed primarily for industrial applications where conventional electronic sensors cannot be used in environments where materials degradation prevents the use of conventional gas and humidity sensors.

40|$|We present <b>fiberised</b> OCT systems {{developed}} to image biological tissue with high depth resolution, The systems can deliver transversal {{as well as}} longitudinal OCT images. When in the transversal mode, the systems provide a confocal image simultaneously with the OCT image. Design particularities in adopting the system for imaging either the skin or the retina in vivo are presented. They refer to the interface optics, power to the tissue and imaging speed. Images from retina and skin in vitro and in vivo are shown. When applied to the eye, line rates up to 1 kHz and frame rates up to 5 Hz can be used. In order to improve the penetration depth in skin, lower scanning rates are used. Also, flow of milk into a vessel simulator is investigated using Doppler OCT. In this case, no transversal scanning is applied. The laminar profile of the velocity inside the vessel is determined with the depth accuracy of the OCT...|$|R
40|$|Optical fibre {{nanowires}} (OFN) {{have recently}} attracted increased attention {{because of their}} numerous applications in sensing and particle manipulation [1] and their extraordinary optical and mechanical properties, which include, amongst others: biocompatibility: OFNs show good compatibility with cells/ biological matter as they are made from silica. configurability/flexibility: OFN are manufactured stretching optical fibres, thus they maintain their original size at the extremities (fig. 1), allowing for prompt connection to any <b>fiberised</b> source/detector. robustness: OFNs are extremely strong and have a conventional fibre pigtail at their extremity, thus can be handled with tools typical of the macroscopic world. large evanescent fields: a considerable fraction of the transmitted power can propagate outside the OFN physical boundary when the OFN size is small, allowing for enhanced sensing and optical manipulation. strong confinement: when OFNs are nanostructured and metal coated, light can be confined to 50 - 100 nm spot sizes, allowing for nanosensing and single nanoparticle trapping/manipulation...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{high-throughput}} and scalable technique {{for the production}} of metal nanowires embedded in glass fibres by taking advantage of thin film properties and patterning techniques commonly used in planar microfabrication. This hybrid process enables the fabrication of single nanowires and nanowire arrays encased in a preform material within a single fibre draw, providing an alternative to costly and time-consuming iterative fibre drawing. This method allows the combination of materials with different thermal properties to create functional optoelectronic nanostructures. As a proof of principle of the potential of this technique, centimetre long gold nanowires (bulk Tm = 1064 °C) embedded in silicate glass fibres (Tg = 567 °C) were drawn in a single step with high aspect ratios (> 10 ^ 4); such nanowires can be released from the glass matrix and show relatively high electrical conductivity. Overall, this fabrication method could enable mass manufacturing of metallic nanowires for plasmonics and nonlinear optics applications, as well as the integration of functional multimaterial structures for completely <b>fiberised</b> optoelectronic devices...|$|R
40|$|High {{average power}} laser sources {{operating}} in the picosecond (ps) regime are useful {{for a wide range}} of applications including frequency-doubling and pumping of OPOs. Gain switching (GS) of laser diodes provides a practical and low cost method to generate ps pulses at GHz repetition rates and mW average power levels. Such devices represent excellent seeds for high power fiber MOPAs allowing power scaling to the 100 W regime and we recently reported average powers in excess of 300 W from a 1060 nm gain-switched FP laser seeded ytterbium doped fiber amplifier (YDFA) MOPA [1, 2]. However this system incorporated free space pump and signal coupling - greatly compromising the practicality of the system. Moreover, the output polarization was ill-defined limiting the utility of the system for many frequency conversion applications. Herein we present a <b>fiberised,</b> diode-seeded, YDFA MOPA system generating linearly polarized, diffraction-limited, 20 ps pulses at repetition rates ranging from 113. 5 MHz to 908 MHz and at average output powers in excess of 100 W. This system represents a considerable improvement in practicality and performance relative to previous high power, fiber-based ps pulse sources [3]. The output of the MOPA was launched into an LBO crystal to generate 45 W of green light...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of ultrafast laser technology and high-speed fibre-optic communications, {{has resulted in}} the need to develop all-optical techniques for implementing many network operations. Superstructured fibre Bragg grating (FBG) technology has advanced {{to the point that the}} design and fabrication of passive filters of highly complicated optical responses is feasible. Thus, FBGs can be used for applications involving coherent control of short or ultrashort pulses, such as pattern generation and pulse shaping at high speeds. Key benefits offered by this filtering approach are full integration with <b>fiberised</b> systems, and precise control of the amplitude and phase of the filter responses. Due to their coherence properties, superstructured FBGs are monolithic devices, and consequently their operation does not require any external configurations (e. g. adjustable delay lines, etc.). We have demonstrated this powerful signal processing technique in a series of different experiments, including the generation of a 40 GHz pulsed signal by repetition rate multiplication of 10 GHz pulses, and shaping of solitons into square pulses. In this talk I will focus mainly on our more recent results, concerning pulse encoding and decoding schemes suitable for optical code-division multiple access (OCDMA) systems. Bipolar codes of a chip rate of 160 Gchip/s are written in single superstructured FBGs. An incoming 10 Gbit/s signal is encoded, transmitted and then decoded using a second, matched-filter FBG...|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} future {{implementation of}} high speed optical networks and optical processing schemes {{is dependent on}} the continued development {{of a wide range of}} high performance optoelectronic devices and subsystems. In this presentation we review recent advances in the development of fibre based components that could prove attractive for use in future all-optical processing systems. The development of materials with large, fast optical nonlinearities is of great interest for many all-optical processing schemes. We describe recent progress at the ORC in the development of glass/fibre devices with increased (relative to conventional silica fibre) optical nonlinearities and which should allow for the fabrication of compact nonlinear fibre devices. In addition, we report the discovery of a new, massive optical nonlinearity associated with reflection from certain liquefying metal surfaces. The nonlinearity is fully compatible with optical fibre technology and has been used to demonstrate fully <b>fiberised,</b> broadband optical switches and gates operating at milliwatt switching powers. Chromatic dispersion is another critical factor in any high speed system exploiting ultrashort optical pulses. We review our latest results on the fabrication, characterisation and use of dispersion varying fibre. The applications of this technology include high bit-rate pulse generation, ultrashort pulse compression, transmission and switching. Fibre Bragg Grating fabrication technology has developed to the extent that precise, arbitrary control of the grating modulation depth and period/phase can be achieved along grating lengths of order 1 m. The control of the grating reflectivity amplitude and phase that this offers opens the way to a whole range of possibilities for optical processing and control of ultrashort pulses including pattern encoding and recognition. Moreover, the nonlinear response of the medium allows for unique opportunities for al-optical switching and logic. We review our recent activities in the area. Finally, we describe recent developments in the area of high power fibre lasers and amplifiers which have opened the way to compact active fibre systems capable of delivering many Watts of output powers. These high power sources make practical the use of nonlinear effects such as Raman scattering for distributed amplification and signal processing leading to additional options and possibilities in the design of high speed optical system...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{potential}} of compound-glass, highly nonlinear, small-core fibres for use in nonlinear applications. Both fibres with a conventional step-index design and small-core holey fibres are considered. While the former technology is more mature, the latter represents the ultimate candidate, since it offers the flexibility of combining novel dispersion properties with a very high nonlinearity. With regard to holey fibre designs, small-core, compound-glass holey fibres with different core diameters and designs are considered for two different background materials: a commercially available lead-silicate glass and a bismuth-oxide based glass. Firstly, characterization measurements are performed on the fabricated holey fibres. The measurements reveal the advantages of each glass type and each fibre design, the ultra-high nonlinearity {{that can be achieved}} in such fibres and the potential of achieving simultaneously a novel dispersion profile and high nonlinearity. Nonlinear applications are then demonstrated for some of the fibres presented. In particular, the use of a lead-silicate holey fibre, having a dispersion-shifted profile, with a zero-dispersion wavelength lying close to the C-band is demonstrated in cross-phase modulation based wavelength conversion and switching applications in the 1. 55 µm window. Both a co-polarized pump and probe scheme and a Kerr-shutter configuration are considered. For the same fibre, the stimulated four-wave mixing process for amplification and wavelength conversion applications in the C-band is thoroughly studied. Numerical simulations and experimental findings are combined to study the fibre performance, demonstrate its applicability to nonlinear wavelength conversion applications and identify future improvement objectives. The suitability of compound-glass holey fibres is also examined for the generation of correlated photons, through spontaneous four-wave mixing, and the generation of a broad supercontinuum by pumping at the convenient in terms of high power laser availability wavelength regions of 1. 0 µm and 1. 5 µm. The experiments presented in this thesis constitute the first nonlinear applications ever reported for dispersion-tailored, compound-glass holey fibres, clearly revealing their potential in fibre-based nonlinear applications. Nonlinear applications are also demonstrated for a commercially available, <b>fiberised,</b> bismuth-oxide based fibre with a step-index design. Using this fibre, an all-optical regenerator of Return-to-Zero picosecond pulses is realized at repetition rates of 10 and 40 Gb/s. The same fibre is also employed in an all-fiberised pulse compression scheme, which relies on nonlinear pulse propagation in the normal dispersion regime and enables the compression of picosecond pulses down to the femtosecond scale. In both applications, the ultra high nonlinearity of the compound-glass, step-index fibre results in reduced fibre-length and peak power requirements. The thesis concludes by addressing the issues concerning the practicality of compound-glass fibres and proposing potential future directions...|$|R
40|$|The {{degenerate}} cubic optical nonlinearity of an indium-glass interface in {{the vicinity}} of the melting point has been measured for the first time at 1260 nm using a spectroscopic technique based on the pump probe specular inverse Faraday effect. A considerable enhancement of the nonlinearity was observed approaching the melting point from below with a magnitude of 6. 3 x 10 - 7 e. s. u. (8. 8 x 10 - 15 m 2 Volt- 2) The nonlinear response was faster than 90 fs. Away from the melting the nonlinearity is attributed to the spin flipping mechanism. Near the melting point it is associated with weakly bound highly unharmonic electrons. An optical nonlinearity of a gallium dielectric interface has been used to achieve a broadband light by light control at milliwatt power levels. The broadband optical nonlinearity of an alpha-gallium-dielectric interface is shown to enhance near the bulk melting point (30 °). The magnitude of the nonlinearity is ~ 1 e. s. u. (1. 4 x 10 - 8 m 2 Volt- 2). The nonlinear response was found to have various components ranging from at least in the micro to nanosecond range. Up to a 30 % modulation of a probe beam in reflected light intensity has been observed. In a <b>fiberised</b> architecture the nonlinearity is exploited to make an optical switch at 1. 5 µm. Cross wavelength switching is also presented at 1. 3 µm and 1. 5 µm where the modulation in reflected light exceeded 40 % with dynamics of ~ 140 ns. Based on the same nonlinearity a new passive self-starting Q-switching ring laser is presented. The pulse duration is ~ 1. 5 µs with peak powers exceeding > 100 mW. The nonlinearity is attributed to the metallisation and recrystallisation velocities of gallium. The nonreciprocity of natural polarisation has been observed in the optically active crystal Bi(12) SiO(20) at 632. 8, 514. 5, 501. 7, 496. 5, 476. 5, and 457. 9 nm. A nonreciprocal component of the polarisation rotation of 2 x 10 - 3 radians was detected on the background of the polarisation rotation due to conventional optical activity. The nonreciprocal rotation has been attributed to the presence of the symmetric part of the nonlocality tensor Re[gamma,xyz + gamma,xyz] ~ 5 x 10 - 12 cm at 457. 9 nm. The giant birefringence (0. 03 < dn < 0. 3) due to the quadratic term in the constitutive equation for ZnSe along the [110] direction in the excitonic region in reflection was measured for the first time. Using this effect a reflective configuration technique for studying crystallographic domains in cubic crystals has been developed...|$|R
