50|$|Touch {{surfaces}} {{commonly found}} in hospital rooms, such as bed rails, call buttons, touch plates, chairs, <b>door</b> handles, <b>light</b> <b>switches,</b> grab rails, intravenous poles, dispensers (alcohol gel, paper towel, soap), dressing trolleys, and counter and table tops {{are known to be}} contaminated with Staphylococcus, MRSA (one of the most virulent strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Objects in closest proximity to patients have the highest levels of MRSA and VRE. This is why touch surfaces in hospital rooms can serve as sources, or reservoirs, for the spread of bacteria from the hands of healthcare workers and visitors to patients.|$|R

2500|$|The second batch were {{registered}} {{and used by}} the factory in Northern Ireland, with registration numbers (license plates), AXI 1697, AXI 1698, AXI 1699 and are referred to by enthusiasts as the [...] "AXI cars". These three cars (VINs 5565, 5592 and 5638) differ from the first Wooler-Hodec cars in several ways. These three cars all had roof mounted radio antennas, indicator repeater lights, no side marker <b>lights,</b> white forward-facing <b>door</b> <b>lights,</b> fog-light <b>switch,</b> and textured body rubstrips on the stainless panels. No catalytic converters or Lambda equipment were fitted as British legislation did not require them. VIN 5565 with the registration number AXI 1697 was a fully UK homologated example {{which would have been}} shown at the British motor show at Birmingham, UK in October 1982. It includes a unique rearward-facing twin exhaust, no catalytic converters and the UK specification engine as used by Volvo, but retaining the usual Renault ancillaries. The transmission final drive was also set at 3.88:1 versus the standard 3.44:1. Attention was paid to other unique details such as correctly offset wing mirrors.|$|R

The {{commitment to a}} Total Work of Art gave Breuer responsibility for designing all the furniture and furnishings in the house, from major pieces to details such as <b>door</b> hardware, <b>lighting,</b> <b>light</b> <b>switches</b> and {{a whole range of}} novel devices. It would be the single most important commission of his American career for inventing new furniture. Two thirds of the designs Breuer would create during his American years were created for the Frank House and exist nowhere else. Hundreds of new designs were developed, using new ways of shaping and finishing wood and new materials such as DuPont’s Lucite polymer, a revolutionary new material at the time.|$|R
50|$|In the {{hospital}} setting toilet seats {{are a common}} vector for infection, and wiping seats clean before and/or after use can help {{to prevent the spread}} of MRSA. <b>Door</b> handles, faucets, <b>light</b> <b>switches,</b> etc. can be disinfected regularly with disinfectant wipes. Spray disinfectants can be used on upholstery. Carpets can be washed with disinfectant, and hardwood floors can be scrubbed with diluted tea tree oil (e.g. Melaleuca). Laundry soap containing tea tree oil may be effective at decontaminating clothing and bedding, especially if hot water and heavy soil cycles are used, however tea tree oil may cause a rash which MRSA can re-colonize. Alcohol-based sanitizers can be placed near bedsides, near sitting areas, in vehicles etc. to encourage their use.|$|R
5000|$|A {{mobility}} {{assistance dog}} is a service dog trained to assist a physically disabled {{person who has}} mobility issues, which may include being wheelchair-dependent. Among other tasks such as [...] "providing balance and stability" [...] and [...] "pulling wheelchairs or carrying and picking up things for persons with mobility impairments", a mobility assistance dog can be trained to open and close <b>doors,</b> and operate <b>light</b> <b>switches,</b> and can [...] "have a major {{positive impact on the}} lives of recipients". These dogs usually wear a certain kind of vest so that you can attach a cane like handle. This makes it so that when the dog walks and you hold the handle, the dog will guide you and assist with balance.|$|R
50|$|ASIMO stands 130 cm {{tall and}} weighs 54 kg. Research {{conducted}} by Honda {{found that the}} ideal height for a mobility assistant robot was between 120 cm and the height of an average adult, which is conducive to operating <b>door</b> knobs and <b>light</b> <b>switches.</b> ASIMO {{is powered by a}} rechargeable 51.8 V lithium-ion battery with an operating time of one hour. Switching from a nickel metal hydride in 2004 increased the amount of time ASIMO can operate before recharging. ASIMO has a three-dimensional computer processor that was created by Honda and consists of a three stacked die, a processor, a signal converter and memory. The computer that controls ASIMO's movement is housed in the robot's waist area and can be controlled by a PC, wireless controller, or voice commands.|$|R
40|$|Maintaining a {{contamination}} {{free sample}} preparation lab for biological 14 C AMS requires {{the same or}} more diligence as a radiocarbon dating prep lab. Isotope ratios of materials routinely range over 4 – 8 orders of magnitude in a single experiment, dosing solutions contain thousands of DPM and gels used to separate proteins possess 14 C ratios of 1 amol 14 C/mg C. Radiocarbon contamination is a legacy of earlier tracer work in most biological laboratories, {{even if they were}} never hot labs. Removable surface contamination can be found and monitored using swipes. Contamination can be found on any surface routinely touched: <b>door</b> knobs, <b>light</b> <b>switches,</b> drawer handles, water faucets. In general, all surfaces routinely touched need to be covered with paper, foil or plastic that can be changed frequently. Shared air supplies can also present problems by distributing hot aerosols throughout a building. Aerosols can be monitored for 14 C content using graphitized coal or fullerene soot mixed with metal powder as an absorber. The monitors can be set out in work spaces for 1 – 2 weeks and measured by AMS with regular samples. Frequent air changes help minimize aerosol contamination in many cases. Cross-contamination of samples can be minimized by using disposable plastic or glassware in the prep lab, isolating samples from the air when possible and using positive displacement pipettors...|$|R
40|$|Presented in the G. Wayne Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons, Room 144 on October 3, 2013 from 5 : 00 pm to 7 : 00 pm. Runtime: 80 : 45 minutes. Based on the 2013 First Year Common Reading Book: Living with {{complexity}} by Donald A. Norman, MIT Press, 2010. If only today’s technology were simpler! It’s {{the universal}} lament, but it’s wrong. We don't want simplicity. Simple tools are {{not up to}} the task. The world is complex; our tools need to match that complexity. Simplicity turns out to be more complex than we thought. In this provocative and informative book, Don Norman writes that the complexity of our technology must mirror the complexity and richness of our lives. It’s not complexity that’s the problem, it’s bad design. Bad design complicates things unnecessarily and confuses us. Good design can tame complexity. Norman gives us a crash course in the virtues of complexity. But even such simple things as salt and pepper shakers, <b>doors,</b> and <b>light</b> <b>switches</b> become complicated when {{we have to deal with}} many of them, each somewhat different. Managing complexity, says Norman, is a partnership. Designers have to produce things that tame complexity. But we too have to do our part: we have to take the time to learn the structure and practice the skills. This is how we mastered reading and writing, driving a car, and playing sports, and this is how we can master our complex tools. Complexity is good. Simplicity is misleading. The good life is complex, rich, and rewarding—but only if it is understandable, sensible, and meaningful...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hospital {{cleaning}} {{practices and}} methods for their assessment {{are important for}} healthcare-associated infections prevention. Aims of the study were: i) to assess the daily cleaning procedures of different surfaces in hospital bathrooms with a fluorescent marker, ii) to study correlations between results obtained by this method and microbial contamination. Methods: We enrolled 44 bathrooms of six hospital wards (A, B and C medical; D, E and F surgical) in which we analysed 218 surfaces (basin, toilet seat, flush button, inside <b>door</b> handle, <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> and floor). We applied a UV-fluorescent marker to these surfaces and the following day we assigned a score according how completely the marker had been removed. On the floor of each bathroom we also placed Petri dishes to assess bacterial colony forming units (CFU). The Wilcoxon test was used for comparisons between wards, Fisher’s exact test for removal scores comparisons between different objects, Spearman’s coefficient for correlations between CFU score and marker removal score. Results: Ward F proved to be less clean than wards A, B and E (p< 0. 05). Medical unitswere cleaner than surgical ones (p= 0. 0016). Basins were cleaner than the other surfaces (p< 0. 05), toilet seats were dirtier than floors (p= 0. 048) and door handles (p= 0. 013). CFU score and mark removal score {{did not seem to}} be correlated. Conclusions: The UV marker proved to be a practical and effective method for checking cleaning procedures.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for {{detection}} and segmentation of foreground objects from a video which contains both stationary and moving background objects and undergoes both gradual and sudden “once-off ” changes. A Bayes decision rule for classification of background and foreground from selected feature vectors is formulated. Under this rule, different types of background objects will be classified from foreground objects by choosing a proper feature vector. The stationary background object is described by the color feature, and the moving background object {{is represented by the}} color co-occurrence feature. Foreground objects are extracted by fusing the classification results from both stationary and moving pixels. Learning strategies for the gradual and sudden “once-off ” background changes are proposed to adapt to various changes in background through the video. The convergence of the learning process is proved and a formula to select a proper learning rate is also derived. Experiments have shown promising results in extracting foreground objects from many complex backgrounds including wavering tree branches, flickering screens and water surfaces, moving escalators, opening and closing <b>doors,</b> <b>switching</b> <b>lights</b> and shadows of moving objects...|$|R
