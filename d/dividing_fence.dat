30|$|According {{to local}} expert {{interviews}} small livestock farmers are considered those with farm size less than 20 hectares, while big-scale producers are considered {{those with more}} than 400 hectares. According to official cattle vaccination data in the Municipality of Cachoeiras de Macacu in 2011, an estimation of the herd size can be given {{on the base of}} vaccinated animals. This resulted in 27, 995 animals in all three districts of this Municipality (Secretary of Agriculture, Cattle Farming, Fisheries and Supply [2011]). Most livestock farmers (90 %) have less than 500 animals and small-scale producers are considered in this municipality those with less than 20 animals.

50|$|The Mayor of Warwick, at a {{ceremony}} attended by 2000, people laid the foundation stone on 25 June 1874. The stonework was contracted to John McCulloch {{at a cost of}} £1055. John Keleher carried out the timber structures and joinery. The roof was originally shingled. It was completed by the end of March 1875 and was known as the Warwick Central School, the Warwick National School being renamed the Warwick East School.

50|$|The current Woodbridge Township Hall {{was built}} in 1855 after the Woodbridge Township board voted and {{approved}} $250 {{for the construction of}} a town hall. They also appropriated $10 to purchase a suitable site located in Section 16 of Woodbridge Township. The building committee eventually selected the building site at the corner of Woodbridge and Montgomery roads, just west, and above the St. Joseph River. The original structure was constructed using popular, or tulip wood and completed in 1856. Approximately twenty years later an addition was built onto the original structure and soon after, in 1890, polling booths and a <b>dividing</b> <b>fence</b> were completed.|$|E

40|$|Summary {{of major}} points {{suggested}} {{to be included}} in the forthcoming QLRC discussion paper: 1. Whether Neighbourhood Disputes (<b>Dividing</b> <b>Fences</b> and Trees) Act 2011 (Qld) (“the Act”) should specifically refer to mediation and related dispute resolution interventions. 2. If retaining walls are incorporated into the Act, does the title of the Act require alteration? 3. Are amendments necessary to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2009 (Qld) ? 4. Whether there is a need for a register of all QCAT orders made under the Act, rather than just for orders relating to trees as is presently required. 5. In implementing the Act, whether the Department of Justice and Attorney-General dispute resolution centres should establish a physical and accessible presence in Southeast Queensland beyond Brisbane. 6. In implementing the Act, what measures could be taken to increase and improve access to justice by having greater regard to the linguistic and cultural disadvantage of non-English speaking background disputants, disabled disputants and women and other disadvantaged groups in society. 7. To consider how the Department of Justice and Attorney-General and Community Legal Centres, along with Community Justice Centres can better cooperate to achieve the Act’s objectives...|$|R

30|$|Within the Mara ecosystem, {{where the}} tourism ‘product’ demands {{international}} acclaim, a new conservation model has emerged under {{the premise of}} wildlife conservation and community empowerment/prosperity. Having been experimented elsewhere in Kenya (e.g. Laikipia) and more broadly (e.g. Namibia), this new model, termed a conservancy, {{can be defined as}} a commons institution (Hoole and Berkes 2010) whereby individual landowners or communal resource users pool lands to create a singular trust where benefits from wildlife and tourism development are shared by participants (Sorlie 2008). In the Mara, this model has resulted in a leasing arrangement whereby Maasai landowners agree to limit resource use by physically moving off the land, restricting grazing and cultivation activities and adjusting other land uses that may conflict with wildlife conservation. The landowners then partner with local, national and/or international tourism operators, who pay for exclusive access within the conservancy boundary and all tourism infrastructures. Rather than a commons resource institution, the Mara conservancy model appears more like a business partnership, where Maasai landowners are directly linked to private enterprise. They agree to vacate portions of their land and forego grazing rights in key conservation areas in exchange for monthly, guaranteed payments by leasing ecotourism operators, independent of tourist volume. The emergence of conservancies in the Mara, a story unto itself, largely falls within three distinct drivers as interpreted by research participants: (1) the historical failures to protect user rights and re-distribute tourism rents to adjacent communities (e.g. wildlife associations); (2) the emergence of new business and/or profit-seeking interventions and opportunities that improve the quality of tourist experiences in a period of overused, aesthetically degraded national parks (e.g. demand to ‘save’ the tourism industry from overcrowded mass tourism); and (3) a growing sense within domestic and international discourses of the urgency to conserve un-fragmented landscapes for the conservation of charismatic mega fauna (e.g. the sense that after privatization, as in other areas of Maasailand, rangelands are <b>divided,</b> <b>fenced,</b> turned to crops, and otherwise undesirable for wildlife and associated tourism).|$|R
