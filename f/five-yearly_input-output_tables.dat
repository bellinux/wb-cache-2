The hybrid approach of constructing regional <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> was adopted in this 47 region-interregional input-output study. First of all, all intra-regional <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> at prefecture level were prepared. We can use intra-regional <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> of all prefectures in Japan from 1990. The second step is the estimation of interregional trade coefficients. When inter-regional <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> are constructed, Estimation of interregional trade coefficients is very important. In this study, we propose a method for estimation of interregional trade using a distribution census and some data. And the interregional trade coefficients were adjusted by using a new iterative method so that the sum total of the total output of 47 regions might suit the amount of total output of Japan. Finally, a 47 interregional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> was compiled using tables of 47 all prefectures and the interregional trade coefficients.
