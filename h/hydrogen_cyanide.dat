5|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>cyanide</b> is a {{poisonous}} gas that interferes with cellular respiration. Cyanide prevents the cell from producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by binding {{to one of}} the proteins involved in the electron transport chain. This protein, cytochrome c oxidase, contains several subunits and has ligands containing iron groups. The cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups, heme a3, forming a more stabilized compound through metal-to-ligand pi bonding. As a result of the formation of this new iron-cyanide complex, the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 group can no longer do so. Instead, these electrons destabilize the compound; thus, the heme group no longer accept them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and cells can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP. In a human weighing , death occurs within two minutes of inhaling 70mg of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cyanide.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>cyanide,</b> {{discovered}} in the late 18th century, {{was used in the}} 1880s for the fumigation of citrus trees in California. Its use spread to other countries for the fumigation of silos, goods wagons, ships, and mills. Its light weight and rapid dispersal meant its application had to take place under tents or in enclosed areas. Research by Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry led to the founding in 1919 of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schädlingsbekämpfung mbH (Degesch), a state-controlled consortium formed to investigate military use of the chemical. Chemists at Degesch added a cautionary eye irritant to a less volatile cyanide compound which reacted with water in the presence of heat to become <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cyanide.</b> The new product was marketed as the pesticide Zyklon (cyclone). As a similar formula had been used as a weapon by the Germans during World War I, Zyklon was soon banned.|$|E

5|$|Cyanogenic glycosides {{are stored}} in {{inactive}} forms in plant vacuoles. They become toxic when herbivores eat the plant and break cell membranes allowing the glycosides to {{come into contact with}} enzymes in the cytoplasm releasing <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cyanide</b> which blocks cellular respiration.

Benzoxazinoids, secondary defence metabolites, which are characteristic for grasses (Poaceae), are also stored as inactive glucosides in the plant vacuole. Upon tissue disruption they get into contact with β-glucosidases from the chloroplasts, which enzymatically release the toxic aglucones. Whereas some benzoxazinoids are constitutively present, others are only synthesised following herbivore infestation, and thus, considered inducible plant defenses against herbivory.|$|E

40|$|The {{endogenous}} ABA {{contents of}} dormant and nondormant barley grains were determined following application of different compounds to break dormancy. The chemicals used for breaking of dormancy in intact dormant grains were weak and strong acids, alcohols,. <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide, <b>cyanide,</b> nitrate, salicylic acid, gibberellic acid and fusicoccin. The dormancy-breaking compounds could be classified into two major groups: compounds {{that caused a}} decrease in endogenous ABA (class I) and compounds which did not affect endogenous ABA (class II). Class I compounds included gibberellic acid, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, nitrate, salicylic acid; class II compounds were fusicoccin, acid (H 2 SO 4), sodium azide, n-caproic acid. in addition, these dormancy-breaking compounds were able to stimulate the germination rate when applied to embryos isolated from dormant grains. The concentrations necessary for stimulation of germination of isolated embryos were {{much lower than the}} concentrations for breaking the dormancy of intact grains. After embryos were isolated from dormant grains and incubated in water, ABA was determined in both embryos and in the incubation media. The class I compounds stated above also reduced ABA content in the incubation medium of isolated embryos, while class II compounds had no effect on ABA content of the medium. External application of ABA could overcome the effect of dormancy-breaking compounds of class I but not of class II.
