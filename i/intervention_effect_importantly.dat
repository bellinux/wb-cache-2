We suggest a computationally feasible approach to these problems, focusing especially on the detection and estimation of sudden shifts and outliers. We consider three different scenarios, namely the detection of an <b>intervention</b> <b>effect</b> of a known type at a known time, the detection of an <b>intervention</b> <b>effect</b> when the type and the time are both unknown and the detection of multiple <b>intervention</b> <b>effects.</b> We develop score tests for the first scenario and a parametric bootstrap procedure based on the maximum of the different score test statistics for the second scenario.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses {{including}} {{a limited number}} of patients and events are prone to yield overestimated <b>intervention</b> <b>effect</b> estimates. While many assume bias is the cause of overestimation, theoretical considerations suggest that random error may be an equal or more frequent cause. The independent impact of random error on meta-analyzed <b>intervention</b> <b>effects</b> has not previously been explored. It has been suggested that surpassing the optimal information size (i. e., the required meta-analysis sample size) provides sufficient protection against overestimation due to random error, but this claim has not yet been validated. METHODS: We simulated a comprehensive array of meta-analysis scenarios where no <b>intervention</b> <b>effect</b> existed (i. e., relative risk reduction (RRR)  =  0 %) or where a small but possibly unimportant effect existed (RRR =  10 %). We constructed different scenarios by varying the control group risk, the degree of heterogeneity, and the distribution of trial sample sizes. For each scenario, we calculated the probability of observing overestimates of RRR> 20 % and RRR> 30 % for each cumulative 500 patients and 50 events. We calculated the cumulative number of patients and events required to reduce the probability of overestimation of <b>intervention</b> <b>effect</b> to 10 %, 5 %, and 1 %. We calculated the optimal information size for each of the simulated scenarios and explored whether meta-analyses that surpassed their optimal information size had sufficient protection against overestimation of <b>intervention</b> <b>effects</b> due to random error. RESULTS: The risk of overestimation of <b>intervention</b> <b>effects</b> was usually high when the number of patients and events was small and this risk decreased exponentially over time as the number of patients and events increased. The number of patients and events required to limit the risk of overestimation depended considerably on the underlying simulation settings. Surpassing the optimal information size generally provided sufficient protection against overestimation. CONCLUSIONS: Random errors are a frequent cause of overestimation of <b>intervention</b> <b>effects</b> in meta-analyses.

This poses problems for the widely used inverse-variance method that weights the study-specific IRRs to generate a pooled estimate. METHODS: We conducted a simulation study to compare the inverse-variance method of conducting a meta-analysis (with and without the continuity correction) with alternative methods based on either Poisson regression with fixed <b>interventions</b> <b>effects</b> or Poisson regression with random <b>intervention</b> <b>effects.</b> We manipulated the percentage of zeros in the intervention group (from no zeros to approximately 80 percent zeros), the levels of baseline variability and heterogeneity in the <b>intervention</b> <b>effect,</b> {{and the number of}} studies that comprise each meta-analysis. We applied these methods to an example from our own work in suicide prevention and to a recent meta-analysis of the effectiveness of condoms in preventing HIV transmission. RESULTS: As the percentage of zeros in the data increased, the inverse-variance method of pooling data shows increased bias and reduced coverage. Estimates from Poisson regression with fixed <b>interventions</b> <b>effects</b> also display evidence of bias and poor coverage, due to their inability to account for heterogeneity. Pooled IRRs from Poisson regression with random <b>intervention</b> <b>effects</b> were unaffected by the percentage of zeros in the data or the amount of heterogeneity.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Within epidemiology, a {{stepped wedge}} trial design (i. e., a one-way {{crossover}} trial in which several arms start the intervention at different time points) is increasingly popular {{as an alternative}} to a classical cluster randomized controlled trial. Despite this increasing popularity, there is a huge variation in the methods used to analyze data from a stepped wedge trial design. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Four linear mixed models were used to analyze data from a stepped wedge trial design on two example data sets. The four methods were chosen because they have been (frequently) used in practice. Method 1 compares all the intervention measurements with the control measurements. Method 2 treats the intervention variable as a time-independent categorical variable comparing the different arms with each other. In method 3, the intervention variable is a time-dependent categorical variable comparing groups with different number of intervention measurements, whereas in method 4, the changes in the outcome variable between subsequent measurements are analyzed. RESULTS: Regarding the results in the first example data set, methods 1 and 3 showed a strong positive <b>intervention</b> <b>effect,</b> which disappeared after adjusting for time. Method 2 showed an inverse <b>intervention</b> <b>effect,</b> whereas method 4 did not show a significant effect at all. In the second example data set, the results were the opposite. Both methods 2 and 4 showed significant <b>intervention</b> <b>effects,</b> whereas the other two methods did not. For method 4, the <b>intervention</b> <b>effect</b> attenuated after adjustment for time. CONCLUSION: Different methods to analyze data from a stepped wedge trial design reveal different aspects of a possible <b>intervention</b> <b>effect.</b> The choice of a method partly depends on the type of the intervention and the possible time-dependent <b>effect</b> of the <b>intervention.</b> Furthermore, it is advised to combine the results of the different methods to obtain an interpretable overall result...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to identify mediators of the effects of a combined resistance and aerobic exercise program on perceived physical and general health in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. METHODS In total, 57 patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of resistance and aerobic exercise or usual care. The outcome measures of physical and general health were assessed by standardized questionnaires. Linear regression analyses were conducted on the residual change scores of the variables. The mediating effects of fatigue, muscle strength, and functional performance on the intervention's effect on physical and general health were examined using the product of coefficients method. Bootstrapping was used to calculate the 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). RESULTS The exercise intervention was found to significantly improve physical (beta, 5. 03; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 9. 04) and general health (beta, 12. 89; 95 % CI, 2. 24 - 23. 54). Upper body muscle strength and walking speed significantly mediated the <b>intervention</b> <b>effect</b> on physical health (beta, 2. 65; 95 % CI, 0. 64 - 5. 54), accounting for 53 % of the total effect. Walking speed and fatigue were found to be mediators in the <b>intervention</b> <b>effect</b> on general health (beta, 7. 52; 95 % CI, 2. 16 - 16. 92), accounting for 51 % of the total <b>effect.</b> CONCLUSIONS The <b>intervention</b> <b>effects</b> on physical and general health were explained by different mediating mechanisms. Walking speed mediated the <b>intervention</b> <b>effect</b> on both physical and general health. The <b>intervention</b> <b>effect</b> on physical health was further mediated by upper body strength, whereas the effect on general health was mediated by fatigue. © 2013 American Cancer Society...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background With an {{increasing}} research focus on multiple health behaviour change interventions, a methodological issue requiring further investigation {{is whether or}} not to employ pre-trial behavioural screening to exclude participants who are achieving a pre-specified level of one or more behaviours. Behavioural screening can be used to direct limited resources to participants most in need of a behaviour change intervention; but may reduce the representativeness of the sample and limit comparability with trials that do not employ pre-trial behavioural screening. Furthermore, the impact of this type of screening on intervention participation and <b>intervention</b> <b>effects</b> is unknown. Methods Data for this study come from the Logan Healthy Living Program, a randomised, controlled telephone counselling lifestyle intervention trial which did not employ behavioural screening prior to randomisation. Screening for physical activity, diet or the combination was simulated using baseline trial data. To examine the impact of behavioural screening on intervention participation (in terms of participant characteristics, intervention dose received and retention), characteristics of participants included an excluded under the various screening scenarios were compared. To examine the impact of behavioural screening on <b>intervention</b> <b>effects,</b> results from the main trial analysis were compared with results obtained from the same analyses performed separately for each of the screened groups. Results Simulated pre-trial behavioural screening impacted minimally on intervention dose received and trial retention rate. Beyond the anticipated effect of reducing baseline levels of the behaviours being screened for, behavioural screening affected baseline levels of behaviours not targeted by screening, and participants' demographic and health-related characteristics. Behavioural screening impacted on <b>intervention</b> <b>effects</b> in ways that were anticipated and positive, but also unexpected and detrimental. Physical activity screening (alone or in combination with diet) resulted in improved <b>intervention</b> <b>effects</b> for physical activity, while fruit and vegetable screening had no impact on <b>intervention</b> <b>effects</b> for these outcomes. All three types of screening impacted detrimentally on <b>intervention</b> <b>effects</b> for behaviours not being targeted by screening. Conclusions Behavioural screening may have desirable and undesirable consequences in the context of multiple behaviour intervention trials, and thus its potential merits and pitfalls should be carefully considered. </p...|$|R
