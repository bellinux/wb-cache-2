50|$|On 13 August 2015, {{the church}} was set on fire, {{probably}} by arsonists. Homes were evacuated in Murray Street and Inkerman Street. At its peak, 40 firefighters were at the scene. It took approximately 2 hours to be extinguished. The church was left badly damaged, {{with most of the}} roof burned off. Four teenagers were arrested afterwards, with one fined. After the <b>fire,</b> a <b>surveyor</b> went to check the status of the building, and deemed it safe. It was confirmed that the church would be rebuilt. In May 2016, {{the church was}} auctioned by Paul Fosh auctions, but was removed from market beforehand. The future of the church is currently unknown.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{reaching}} Mars, <b>Surveyor</b> <b>fired</b> {{its main}} rocket engine for the 22-minute Mars orbit insertion (MOI) burn. This maneuver slowed the spacecraft {{and allowed the}} planet's gravity to capture it into orbit. Initially, Surveyor entered a highly elliptical orbit that took 45 hours to complete. The orbit had a periapsis of 262 km above the northern hemisphere, and an apoapsis of 54026 km above the southern hemisphere.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} {{maps of the}} parishes, all {{drawn by}} Petty himself, were preserved in the Surveyor General's office and in the Public Record Office in Dublin. The original Down Survey parish maps were lost in a <b>fire</b> in the <b>Surveyor</b> General's office in 1711, and the authenticated copies of the parish maps were lost in fires at the Public Record Office in the Four Courts during the Irish Civil War of 1922.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{disagreements}} {{in management}} and poor communication, construction began on both routes. It was soon {{obvious that the}} southern route was unfeasible given the remote area, technology {{available at the time}} and the rough terrain of the San Rafael Swell. The D spent $217,470 (1883, equivalent to $4.6million in 2007) on the project before declaring it a failure. One of the accounts in the book Utah Ghost Rails states the railroad <b>fired</b> the lead <b>surveyor,</b> even though the workers had graded a path past the San Rafael Reef. This route today is a jeep trail. According to a sign placed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), had the southern route succeeded {{it would have been the}} shortest transcontinental railroad in the U.S.|$|R
50|$|Kingston {{had been}} founded as {{a refuge for}} {{survivors}} of the 1692 earthquake that destroyed Port Royal. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by the Nick Catania Pirate Fleet's <b>fire</b> in 1703. <b>Surveyor</b> John Goffe drew up {{a plan for the}} town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the center of trade for Jamaica.The government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in Port Royal, and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of Liguanea.|$|R
50|$|Kingston {{was founded}} in July 1692 as a place for {{survivors}} of the 1692 earthquake that destroyed Port Royal. Before the earthquake, Kingston’s functions were purely agricultural. The earthquake survivors set up a camp on the sea front. Approximately two thousand people died due to mosquito-borne diseases. Initially the people lived in a tented camp on Colonel Barry's Hog Crawle. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by <b>fire</b> in 1703. <b>Surveyor</b> John Goffe drew up {{a plan for the}} town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. The new grid system of the town was designed to facilitate commerce, particularly the system of main thoroughfares 66 ft across which allowed transportation between the port and plantations farther inland. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the centre of trade for Jamaica.The government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in Port Royal, and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of Liguanea.|$|R
50|$|In 1872, the {{government}} passed an act to transfer government offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. Kingston had been founded as {{a refuge for}} survivors of the 1692 earthquake that destroyed Port Royal. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by <b>fire</b> in 1703. <b>Surveyor</b> John Goffe drew up {{a plan for the}} town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets.

Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of Liguanea. In 1755 the governor, Sir Charles Knowles, had decided to transfer {{the government}} offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston. The 1907 Kingston earthquake destroyed much of the city. Considered by many writers of that time one of the world's deadliest earthquakes, it resulted in the death of over eight hundred Jamaicans and destroyed the homes of over ten thousand more.|$|R
40|$|In {{the later}} 1870 s, {{conflicts}} developed near Paeroa between a small hapu, Ngati Hako, and other hapu over land sales and surveys. In 1879, after {{some members of}} Ngati Koi offered to sell the Pukehanga Block, at Rotokohu, between Paeroa and Te Aroha, to the Crown, surveyors were sent to determine the boundaries despite threats of violence from Ngati Hako. These threats became a reality with shots being <b>fired,</b> wounding a <b>surveyor’s</b> assistant, ‘Daldy’ McWilliams, who survived by playing dead. Despite Pakeha fury about a ‘weak’ response, officials reacted cautiously, fearing to provoke a wider conflict. Instead of trying to arrest the two men accused of the attempted murder, {{which would have been}} difficult, because Ngati Hako claimed their action was justified the Native Minister encouraged senior Hauraki rangatira to convene a rununga to examine their claim. Ngati Hako said that the block of land was theirs, and as previously other land had been surveyed without their permission they had taken this action. The government was criticized for paying advances on a block that had not been through the land court, and the rununga determined that although Ngati Hako had acted wrongfully, their action could be justified. When Ngati Hako refused to hand over the two accused to the authorities, the rununga claimed not to have the power to hand them over; Ngati Hako then constructed two pa to defend themselves. Such actions provoked much frustration and criticisms of the government amongst Pakeha, but officials who investigated Ngati Hako’s complaints agreed that they had indeed lost land unjustly. Once the owners of a large domain, they had lost their land to the invading Marutuahu, whose slaves they became. When the two accused were arrested in 1882 one was found not guilty and the other was amnestied after eight months in prison because it was believed that, as rangatira, they probably had not fired the shots but had taken the responsibility for the actions of their hapu. As for McWilliams, he received what he considered inadequate compensation. This ‘outrage’ was the first and only time in Hauraki that a Maori had shot a Pakeha, and the government’s cautious but firm response meant that the ‘peace of Hauraki’, although disturbed for a while, was maintained...|$|R
