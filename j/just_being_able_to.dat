At each stage, the models are solved numerically, in order to provide phase diagrams as a function of chain-substrate interaction and misfit.

Their predictions are shown to quantitatively account for the numerical results, thus showing the validity of the continuum approximation in the misfit range under consideration.

Mobile learning (mlearning) is a growing area of pedagogic research, however much of the research so far has focused taking traditional types of instructional learning and putting it on mobile devices, rather than using mobile devices for increased engagement in teaching sessions or for using the devices for capturing information as and when the students are mobile. Herrington et al (2009) claim that although mobile technologies have the potential to be used as powerful learning tools within higher education, “their current use appears to be predominantly within a didactic, teacher-centred paradigm, rather than a more constructivist environment” (p. 2). Most mobile learning devices are centred around social learning, e. g. mobile phones, so their pedagogic potential needs to be further explored. So what is mlearning? Is it to do with use of mobile phones or <b>just</b> the student <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> access information whilst mobile?

However they go on to say that this definition is bound by current technologies, and as technology is constantly changing and improving, we should be flexible in our definition of mobile learning...|$|R
