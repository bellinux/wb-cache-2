50|$|Whether {{trained as}} police {{originally}} or not, Gestapo agents themselves were shaped by their socio-political environment. Historian George C.

Browder also describes a sandwich effect, where from above; Gestapo agents were subjected to <b>ideologically</b> <b>oriented</b> racism and criminal biological theories; and from below, the Gestapo was transformed by SS personnel who did not have the proper police training, which showed in their propensity for unrestrained violence. This admixture certainly shaped the Gestapo's public image which they sought to maintain in lieu of their increasing workload; an image which helped them identify and eliminate enemies of the Nazi state.|$|R
40|$|Service {{orientation}} {{is one of}} the solutions for achieving agile enterprises, that helps make an alignment between business and information technology. By the influx of service orientation into the business domain, a new concept called service oriented organization is created that in business modeling of these enterprises, new modeling elements such as business and software services, rather than business processes are utilized, in which these new elements can describe the business operations more accurately. Based on the increasing significance of the software role in service <b>oriented</b> <b>enterprises,</b> business services and software services are the principal elements in this paper's proposed model.

40|$|Abstract—Service <b>Oriented</b> <b>Enterprise</b> (SOE) {{has brought}} up {{requirement}} for performance {{measurement of the}} novel business model in its dynamic and flexible business environment. To solve the problem, conception of SOE is discussed from business perspective firstly, and an operation architecture of SOE is proposed and analyzed. The Service Oriented Economic Value Added (SO-EVA) performance measurement model is then presented. The model structure of SO-EVA, construction and calculation of indicators, as well as application are given and discussed in this paper. The SO-EVA model {{is based on the}} Economic Value Added (EVA) method, extends EVA into multiple levels and introduces Independent Performance Factors (IPF), to focus on value creation and attain comprehensive performance measurement of SOE, with agility and flexibility. A case study is also given, indicating that the presented model not only better reflects the performance of business operation compared to traditional models, but also supports the business model of SOE more effectively.

50|$|The second {{subsection}} within Chapter 4 {{is titled}} The Role of the Revolutionary Ideologies (169-171). By examining {{the role of}} revolutionary ideologies, this subsection aims to answer why revolutionary leaderships ended up creating the specific kinds of centralized and bureaucratic state structures that they did. It is often argued that the ideologies to which revolutionary leaderships are committed to provide {{the key to the}} nature of revolutionary outcomes. It is further believed that ideologies also reveal the strategies that revolutionary leaders followed as they acted to produce the outcomes. Revolutionary ideologies and people committed to them were necessary ingredients in the social revolutions of China, Russia, and France. In short, existing structural conditions have greatly limited <b>ideologically</b> <b>oriented</b> leaderships in revolutionary crises. Thus they have typically ended up accomplishing very different tasks and producing quite different kinds of new regimes from those they originally ideologically intended.|$|R

40|$|Much recent {{debate in}} {{political}} communication {{has centered on}} the influence of <b>ideologically</b> <b>oriented</b> media outlets.

Analyses of primary 2009 - 2010 statewide survey data (N = 305) reveal the relationship between FOX News and MSNBC consumption to be positive and this association increases substantially once the role of ideology as suppressor is addressed.

The literature examined herein does not fall within the duality of liberalism and radical Marxism usually ascribed to the <b>ideologically</b> <b>oriented</b> literature of the era. This author offers instead a series of investigations into literature and polemics that might instead be considered anarchistic, and which I have defined in their totality as 2 ̆ 2 styles of anarchic will. 2 ̆ 2 These writings by authors such as Norman Mailer, William S. Burroughs, Paul Bowles, and Richard Wright, cover a broad range of topics that were especially relevant to the Cold War era. These topics include, but not limited to race, biopolitics, decolonization, nationalism, and globalization. Thus, this dissertation contributes to the discourse devoted to Cold War literature, as well as the tradition of American literature in which they are framed in the introduction. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is {{consideration}} of presence of ideological factor in aesthetic judgment of architecture. The focus is on the aesthetic theories in which ideology is the key component that can produce aesthetic meaning on the basis of which aesthetic evaluation can be performed. With regard to this, the paper provides an insight into the relevant aesthetic approaches, which, by subject matter and methodology, can be determined as <b>ideologically</b> <b>oriented.</b> The theoretical frame established allows implementation of an interpretive and comparative analysis of two texts that through aesthetic judgment discuss Belgrade architecture, immediately before and after World War II. Through recognition of an ideological context in these two texts, this paper will point out how different aesthetic evaluations of certain morphological aspects of architecture (such as folklorism, ornamentalism, eclecticism, classicism, monumentalism and purism) do not come from inherently architectural, i. e. stylisticformalist aspects, but how they result from ideological connotations attributed to them {{in a wide variety of}} ways. In this sense, this paper finds ideological background in established criteria of aesthetic judgment such as authenticity, homogeneity and contemporaneity...|$|R
