5|$|In 1624, a {{fatality}} occurred {{following a}} match on Saturday, 28 August, at Horsted Keynes, now in East Sussex. A fielder called Jasper Vinall was struck on the <b>head</b> <b>by</b> the batsman, Edward Tye, {{who was trying}} to hit the ball a second time to avoid being caught. Vinall, who died thirteen days later at home in West Hoathly, is thus the earliest recorded cricketing fatality.

The record of the 1624 case confirms that two villages, Horsted Keynes and West Hoathly, were involved in the match and provides further evidence of the growth of village cricket.|$|E
