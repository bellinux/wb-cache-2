The indigenously produced pectinase was partially purified by 50 % batch ethanol precipitation and its general properties were studied following the standard procedures.

40|$|The {{importance}} of many factors for the cloud stability {{of orange juice}} was investigated. By the determination of methanol, cloud loss of orange juice could be ascribed directly to the action of pectin esterase.

This mechanism was confirmed when the addition of pectic acid clarified the orange <b>juice</b> artificially. <b>Clarification</b> did not occur if the formation of high polymer calcium pectate was prevented either by degrading the juice pectin by a purified pectin lyase before substantial action of pectin esterase, or by enzymic hydrolysis by a yeast polygalacturonase of the low methoxy pectin formed.

The {{purpose of}} {{clarification}} {{in the sugar}} industry is to remove soluble, insoluble and colloidal matter from cane <b>juice.</b> Efficient <b>clarification</b> is required to produce high quality sugar and to prevent entrainment of solids in downstream equipment. The objective {{of this study is}} to produce a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of the Magra Ultrasep clarifier. This was accomplished by: • Modelling the hydrodynamics of a laboratory scale clarifier In the Fluent CFD program. • Incorporating the flocculation process into the CFD model. • Performing experiments on a pilot scale clarifier to obtain parameter values for the flocculation model. The hydrodynamic model of the clarifier showed the presence of a recirculation zone above the baffle plate. Particle injections using Fluent's discrete phase modelling option determined that particles within the size range of IOOj [...] Lm to 4 mm would circulate in this region, forming the bed of floc particles required for the Magra Ultrasep to work efficiently. The flocculation process in Fluent was represented using three different solid phases of different particle sizes. Small and medium sized particles were allowed to combine to form larger particles by changing the volume fractions according to three rate equations.

Although bananas {{are widely}} grown {{worldwide}} in many tropical {{and a few}} subtropical countries, banana beverages are still among the fruit beverages processed by use of rudimentary methods {{such as the use}} of feet or/and spear grass to extract juice. Because banana juice and beer remained on a home made basis, there is a research drive to come up with modern technologies to more effectively process bananas and to make acceptable banana juices and wines. One of the main hindrances in the production of highly desirable beverages is the pectinaceous nature of the banana fruit, which makes <b>juice</b> extraction and <b>clarification</b> very difficult. Commercial enzyme applications seem to be the major way forward in solving processing problems in order to improve banana juice and wine quality. The particular pectinolytic enzymes that were selected for this study are Rapidase CB, Rapidase TF, Rapidase X-press and OE-Lallzyme. In addition this study, investigate the applicability of recombinant yeast strains with pectinolytic, xylanolytic, glucanolytic and amylolytic activities in degrading the banana polysaccharides (pectin, xylan, glucan starch) for juice and wine extraction and product clarification. The overall objective of this research was to improve banana juice and wine by enzymatic processing techniques and to improve alcoholic fermentation and to produce limpid and shelf-stable products of clarified juice and wine. The focus was on applying the selected commercial enzyme preparations specifically for the production of better clarified banana juice and wine. This is because the turbid banana juice and beer, which contain suspended solids that are characterised by a very intense banana flavour, require a holistic approach to address challenges and opportunities in order to process pure banana beverages with desirable organoleptic qualities. The specific objectives of applying commercial enzymes in the processing of banana juice and wine, comparing with grape winemaking practices, use of recombinant yeast and analyses of various parameters in the juices and wines made have enabled generation of information that could be of help to prospective banana juice and wine processors. The research findings obtained could be used to establish a pilot plant or small-scale industry in the banana processing beverages producing large quantities,and finally the overall objective of obtaining limpid and shelf stable products would be achieved...|$|R

In this study, a rotating disk module (RDM) equipped with four micro- and ultra-filtration membranes {{was used to}} treat raw chicory root extract, and the permeate flux behavior at high-shear conditions was investigated. Increasing disk rotating speed can reduce concentration polarization and cake fouling, and thus improve permeate flux. However, a moderate rotating speed of 1000 rpm was a good compromise between energy saving and polarization/cake layers control, while a higher disk rotating speed can be used at regular intervals for on-line membrane cleaning. Threshold and limiting fluxes were determined in chicory <b>juice</b> <b>clarification</b> at 1000 rpm and 50 degrees C by pressure stepping experiments, and they were almost independent of pore size, permeability and fouling extent, with ranges of 130 - 140 L m(- 2) h(- 1) for threshold and 155 - 168 L m(- 2) h(- 1) for limiting flux. Below threshold flux, filtration resistance is independent of flux, while above it, membrane fouling increases with increasing permeate flux. This work confirmed that threshold flux criterion was also applicable to high-shear microfiltration and ultrafiltration, and size-dependent shear-induced and Brownian back diffusions {{played an important role}} in such filtration resistance transition. Moreover, both limiting flux and flux fluctuations should be avoided in practical applications because they cause high fouling and flux decline. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{some aspects}} of calcium {{phosphate}} chemistry since phosphate in juice is an important parameter in all sugar <b>juice</b> <b>clarification</b> systems. It uses basic concepts to try and explain the observed differences in clarification performance obtained with various liming techniques. The paper also examines the current colorimetric method used for the determination of phosphate in sugar juice. In this method, a phosphomolybdate blue complex formed due to {{the addition of a}} dye is measured at 660 nm. Unfortunately, at this wavelength there is interference of the colour arising from within the juice and results in the underestimation of the amount of soluble inorganic phosphate content of juice. It is suggested that phosphate analysis be conducted at the higher wavelength of 875 nm where the interference of the juice colour is minimised...|$|E
