6000|$|... "But, my dear Mr. Grey, {{you would}} not have used the word without some meaning. Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{impossible}}? impossible is such a peculiar word." [...] And here the Marquess looked up with great earnestness to a portrait of himself, which hung over the fire-place. It was one of Sir Thomas's happiest efforts; but it was not the happiness of the likeness, or the beauty of the painting, which now attracted his Lordship's attention; he thought only of the costume in which he appeared in that portrait: the court dress of a Cabinet Minister. [...] "Impossible, Mr. Grey, you must confess, is a very peculiar word," [...] reiterated his Lordship.|$|E

'After you had {{concluded}} you had collided with something floating awash, say a water-logged wreck, you were ordered by your captain {{to go forward}} and ascertain {{if there was any}} damage done. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> likely from the force of the blow?' asked the assessor sitting to the left. He had a thin horseshoe beard, salient cheek-bones, and with both elbows on the desk clasped his rugged hands before his face, looking at Jim with thoughtful blue eyes; the other, a heavy, scornful man, thrown back in his seat, his left arm extended full length, drummed delicately with his finger-tips on a blotting-pad: in the middle the magistrate upright in the roomy arm-chair, his head inclined slightly on the shoulder, had his arms crossed on his breast and a few flowers in a glass vase by the side of his inkstand.|$|E
6000|$|Where did {{you hear}} that it was easy to be honest? Do you find that in your Bible? Easy! It is easy to be an ass and follow the {{multitude}} like a blind, besotted bull in a stampede; and that, I am well aware, is what you and Mrs. Grundy mean by being honest. But it will not bear the stress of time nor the scrutiny of conscience. Even before the lowest of all tribunals,—before a court of law, whose business it is, not to keep men right, or within a thousand miles of right, but to withhold them from going so tragically wrong that they will pull down the whole jointed fabric of society by their misdeeds—even before a court of law, as we begin to see in these last days, our easy view of following at each other’s tails, alike to good and evil, is beginning to be reproved and punished, and declared no honesty at all, but open theft and swindling; and simpletons who have gone on through life with a quiet conscience may learn suddenly, from the lips of a judge, that the custom of the trade may be a custom of the devil. You thought it was easy to be honest. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was easy to be just and kind and truthful? Did you think the whole duty of aspiring man was as simple as a horn-pipe? and you could walk through life like a gentleman and a hero, with no more concern than it takes to go to church or to address a circular? And yet all this time you had the eighth commandment! and, what makes it richer, you would not have broken it for the world! ...|$|E

5000|$|The celesbian who is {{open about}} her {{sexuality}} may present {{herself as a}} more socially safe representation of lesbianism. Contemporary musical artists Nicki Minaj and Azealia Banks have both publicly expressed their sexual love of women and have been celebrated in doing so.

[...] Sanford responded, [...] "Well, it plays into a larger conversation that we're having as a family of South Carolinians on, in fact, the constitutional structure of our government." [...] Also, Wolf Blitzer showed Sanford clips of recent comments made by John McCain and Mike Huckabee about the Confederate battle flag and asked Sanford, [...] "All right, two different positions, obviously. Who's right in this?" [...] Sanford responded, [...] "Well, it depends who you talk to." [...] Sanford elaborated that [...] "if you were to talk to the vast majority of South Carolinians, they would say that we {{do not need to be}} debating where the Confederate flag is or is not." ...|$|E
