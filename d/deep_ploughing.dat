5|$|The {{species is}} widely {{distributed}} across the Americas {{with the exception}} of northern Canada and Alaska. It has become resistant to many pesticides, but can be controlled with integrated pest management techniques including <b>deep</b> <b>ploughing,</b> trap crops, chemical control using mineral oil, and biological controls.|$|E
5|$|Two {{kinds of}} control {{measures}} have been advocated since the 19th century. One aims at total pest population reduction, while the other is aimed at protection of the particular crop. , integrated pest management (IPM), an array of techniques and approaches to control pests, was recommended. Practices such as <b>deep</b> <b>ploughing,</b> mechanical destruction, and trap crops are also used to kill different instars. Chemical control is widely successful, and includes the use of applying mineral oil inside the tip of each corn ear, which suffocates the young larvae. Pesticides are one method by which corn earworm populations are controlled; however, since they have been widely used, the insects have become resistant to many pesticides. The use of biological controls, such as the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis and various forms of nematodes, is also common, although not without their own problems. Corn earworm moths are not always vulnerable to the bacterium, and they are only afflicted by nematodes once the larvae have pupated and dropped to the ground.|$|E
25|$|To {{the west}} of the village is the Iron Age hill fort of Ham Hill, a large tribal fort of the Durotriges. The fort was conquered by the Roman Legio II Augusta {{sometime}} around 45 AD. The Romans briefly occupied the fort, then moved to a more permanent garrison at nearby Ilchester (Lindinis), and constructed the Fosse Way Roman road a few miles west of the village. A Roman villa was excavated near Batemoor Barn early in the 20th century and an extensive mosaic documented. Never adequately protected, this has probably been damaged by <b>deep</b> <b>ploughing</b> in the last 20 years.|$|E
40|$|Surface soil {{eutrophication}} hinders ecological restoration projects by favouring {{communities of}} low biodiversity. This study assesses {{the effectiveness of}} a novel technique known as topsoil inversion that may promote recovery from eutrophication. Topsoil inversion is undertaken by a <b>deep</b> <b>plough,</b> which buries 30 cm of topsoil under approximately 40 cm of subsoil. The main study site is within new community woodland on former agricultural land. It comprises <b>deep</b> <b>ploughed</b> and conventionally ploughed plots, to compare two planting types: wildflowers only, and wildflowers with trees. This presentation will discuss some preliminary findings of the effect of topsoil inversion on soil properties and plant tissue nutrient content. Surface soil fertility is lowered following inversion treatment, and this appears to affect plant nutrient sequestration. These results suggest that topsoil inversion has the potential to facilitate ecological restoration on eutrophic soil. This technique may have benefits for restoration projects taking place in a variety of habitats affected by air pollution, including former agricultural land and lowland heaths...|$|R
50|$|Many {{methods have}} been created to reduce the growth of agriculturally {{pathogenic}} sclerotia like changes in crop rotation, <b>deeper</b> <b>ploughing</b> and sifting out sclerotia. Fungicides, breeding disease resistance rye and cross breeding natural rye with hybrid rye have reduced C. purpurea infections. Other fungi that produce sclerotia are prominent pathogens for canola crops. These and related fungi are generally controlled {{through the use of}} fungicides and crop rotation.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the album's overall aesthetic, Turner notes, [...] "it's not {{a radical}} departure, just {{maybe a little}} <b>deeper</b> <b>ploughed</b> into the same furrow," [...] and stated, prior to its release, [...] "I'm very pleased with it, I think I {{achieved}} what I set out to do, which {{was to make a}} record that falls equally between Love Ire & Song and Poetry of the Deed. The songs sound very strong to me." ...|$|R
500|$|Although {{no visible}} tumulus survived into the 1950s, the name [...] "Long Warren" [...] {{suggested}} that knowledge {{of such a}} mound had been known at least into the eighteenth century. Excavation found evidence of the northern and eastern edges of the barrow, however all trace of the western and southern ends of the barrow had been destroyed by levelling and <b>deep</b> <b>ploughing.</b> From the excavation, archaeologists expressed {{the view that the}} barrow was likely trapezoidal or D-shaped, with a width of about 60 feet. It was more difficult to determine the length, although the archaeologist studying the site suggested that it may have been about 50 feet long.|$|E
500|$|The coins {{discovered}} {{during the}} 1994 investigation were {{spread out in}} an ellipse centred on the hoard find spot, running east–west up to a distance of [...] on either side. This distribution {{can be explained by}} the fact that, in 1990, the farmer carried out <b>deep</b> <b>ploughing</b> in an east–west direction on the part of the field where the hoard was found. Previously (since 1967 or 1968, when the land was cleared for agricultural use), the farmer had ploughed in a north–south direction, but the absence of coins north and south of the find spot suggests that the ploughing before 1990 had not disturbed the hoard.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Grinsell had {{examined}} and recorded around 10,000 barrows. Thomas stated that Grinsell's [...] "astonishing volume of published fieldwork... assured for him a place without equal in the history of British archaeological studies". This recording was particularly valuable for archaeologists because it occurred before large numbers of British barrows were heavily damaged as a result of <b>deep</b> <b>ploughing</b> and land development. It also demonstrated the spread of barrows within particular regions and confirmed the older assumption that these barrows were heavily concentrated on areas of chalk geology. Many of the barrows that Grinsell discovered [...] such as Lambourn long barrow in Berkshire [...] were previously unrecorded, while he was also responsible for the discovery of rock art on the face of an Early Bronze Age grave slab at Pool Farm in West Harptree, Somerset.|$|E

25|$|The {{mole plough}} allows {{underdrainage}} {{to be installed}} without trenches, or it breaks up deep impermeable soil layers that impede drainage. It is a very <b>deep</b> <b>plough,</b> with a torpedo-shaped or wedge-shaped tip, and a narrow blade connecting this to the body. When dragged through the ground, it leaves a channel deep under the ground, and this acts as a drain. Modern mole ploughs may also bury a flexible perforated plastic drain pipe as they go, making a more permanent drain– {{or they may be}} used to lay pipes for water supply or other purposes. Similar machines, so called pipe-and-cable-laying ploughs, are even used under the sea, for the laying of cables, as well as preparing the earth for side-scan sonar in a process used in oil exploration.|$|R
50|$|Other {{changes are}} due to farming habits. In {{previous}} years the plateau fields were almost exclusively used for grazing or growing spring wheat and left fallow during the winter. In some years the fields were lightly ploughed and mangolds grown for winter fodder. Following a change in ownership during the 1980s, this changed to winter-sown grain with <b>deep</b> <b>ploughing</b> with sludge injection. The change caused an immediate change to the wildlife. The winter flocks of finches were lost, the yellowhammers disappeared, the skylarks nearly so. The <b>deep</b> <b>ploughing</b> proved counter productive as millions of poppy seeds {{were brought to the}} surface making the grain difficult to harvest - something that had been warned of years earlier by a previous farmer, but disregarded. It was around this time that <b>deep</b> <b>ploughing</b> probably damaged the remains of the Roman mosaic at Batemore; the site was ploughed over (it had never been marked on the ground) and small pieces of tile were brought to the surface. The plateau fields are now {{under the control of the}} park authorities, who are attempting to restore them by allowing natural grassland regrowth, with controlled sheep grazing.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the wear {{properties}} of commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) parts produced using {{selective laser melting}} (SLM) and casting. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations show that SLM-produced CP-Ti parts have martensitic (α΄) microstructure, whereas cast-produced CP-Ti samples exhibit plate-like (α) microstructure. SEM studies on the wear surfaces at moderate loads (15 N) show shallow ploughing grooves at certain regions and some delamination cracks for both SLM and cast CP-Ti samples. On increasing the load to 30 N, <b>deeper</b> <b>ploughing</b> grooves were observed in both samples along with delamination of material at certain regions. However, ploughing grooves {{were found to be}} very shallow in SLM samples compared with the cast parts. Although both SLM and cast CP-Ti exhibited similar wear mechanisms, SLM CP-Ti showed better wear resistance due to its martensitic microstructure, finer grain size and superior microhardness...|$|R
40|$|Research was {{developed}} in the period 1970 - 1995, within long-term stationary experiments, on cambic chernozem at the Research Institute for Cereals and Industrial Crops of Fundulea. Continuous classical tillage was compared with periodical alternation with surface disk harrow tillage, as well as with other works of soil breaking up with tools without furrow turning (chisel, paraplow). In wheat, yield was not significantly affected by soil tillage method, thus ensuring high fuel savings by temporary ploughing elimination. Surface tillage by disking produced a significant yield decrease in maize, due to increased soil compaction and weed infestation of the crop. Rationalization of ground tillage for wheat and maize crops could be achieved within an adequate crop rotation, in which the land may be prepared for wheat by disking or chiseling and for maize by <b>deeper</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Key words: bulk density, fuel consumption, ground tillage...|$|R
30|$|Where {{forage crops}} were lost, fields {{appeared}} to be remediated quickly and successfully. As one example, Miyazaki Prefecture Public Livestock Corporation (MPPLC), who manages 150 ha of farms several kilometres from the volcano, received 7 – 10 kg/m 2 of tephra as well as occasional clasts up to 7 cm in diameter. Most of the farm’s forage crops were buried, with soils undergoing <b>deep</b> <b>ploughed</b> to 60 – 70 cm {{as a first step}} in remediation. A rotary hoe was then used for seedbed preparation. Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium (N-P-K) fertiliser was added with the seed, but suggested Mg-CaCO 3 could not be sourced quickly and planting proceeded without it. A one-off crop of oats and Sudan grass was planted to grow quickly and have high nutrition value; this was harvested in July. Any contamination to the oats/Sudan grass from ongoing light tephra falls or remobilisation of existing tephra deposits did not cause any significant additional damage to forage or affect livestock health.|$|R
50|$|Coming {{under threat}} from chalk quarrying, the {{cemetery}} was first excavated by local archaeologists W.P.D. Stebbing and W. Whiting in 1928-29. After {{it was revealed}} that <b>deep</b> <b>ploughing</b> was becoming a threat to the site, further excavation took place under the finance of the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works between 1959 and 1967, directed by Sonia Chadwick Hawkes.|$|E
50|$|There {{are a few}} {{remains of}} the Roman city visible, such as {{parts of the city}} walls, a hypocaust still in situ under a mosaic floor, and the theatre, as well as items in the Museum (below).

50|$|Alkaline soils {{with solid}} CaCO3 can be {{reclaimed}} with grass cultures, organic compost, waste hair / feathers, organic garbage, waste paper, rejected lemons/oranges, etc. ensuring {{the incorporation of}} much acidifying material (inorganic or organic material) into the soil, and enhancing dissolved Ca in the field water by releasing CO2 gas. <b>Deep</b> <b>ploughing</b> and incorporating the calcareous subsoil into the top soil also helps.|$|E

50|$|Ploughing {{includes}} tilling of soil, intercultural ploughing {{and summer}} ploughing. Ploughing uproots weeds, {{causing them to}} die. In summer ploughing is done during <b>deep</b> summers. Summer <b>ploughing</b> also helps in killing pests.|$|R
5000|$|The larvae {{damage the}} roots of cabbage, turnip, radish, swede and other cruciferous crops. The growth of damaged plants is slow and {{development}} is poor resulting in a reduced yield. Large scale attacks cause cessation of growth with the plants exhibiting a leaden hue and wilting, subsequently turning yellow and dying. Control measures include the early planting of strong plants, the use of peat-compost pots, the use of additional fertilizer, <b>deep</b> autumn <b>ploughing</b> after the harvesting of cruciferous crops and insecticide treatments.|$|R

50|$|Lambourn {{is famous}} for its 'Seven Barrows', just above Upper Lambourn. There are {{actually}} over thirty Bronze Age burial mounds forming a large prehistoric cemetery. On a line west of Seven Barrows is the Long Barrow, which dates from c. 4000 BC making it 2,000 years older than the other barrows. Unfortunately it has been half destroyed by <b>deep</b> <b>ploughing</b> and only the mound in the woods and a few sarsen stones remain.|$|E
50|$|The {{agricultural}} {{suitability of}} Stagnosols is limited {{because of their}} oxygen deficiency resulting from stagnating water above a dense subsoil. Therefore, {{they have to be}} drained. However, in contrast to Gleysols, drainage with channels or pipes is in many cases insufficient. It is necessary to have a higher porosity in the subsoil in order to improve the hydraulic conductivity. This may be achieved by deep loosening or <b>deep</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Drained Stagnosols can be fertile soils owing to their moderate degree of leaching.|$|E
40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in the past decade in plasma nitriding with a majority of the research work focusing on improving hardness and wear resistance of the nitrided surface through the reduction of nitriding temperature, pressure or time. Hard-solid lubricating coatings have also been extensively studied for lowering the wear rate and coefficient of friction of traditional hard coatings such as TiN by the combined effect of hardness and solid lubrication. In this study, the wear characteristics of low-temperature plasma-nitrided steel substrate performed using a Saddle-field fast atom beam source and TiN + MoS x hard-solid lubricant coating deposited by a closed-field magnetron-sputtering technique have been investigated. The thin hard layer in plasma-nitrided substrates exhibited much higher hardness and lower wear compared to the untreated substrate in pin-on-disc wear testing. In addition, the study of the wear track morphology of the nitrided samples evidenced significant reduction of <b>deeper</b> <b>ploughing</b> and plastic deformation due to higher hardness and load supporting of the nitrided layer. On the other hand, due to the incorporation of MoS 2 in TiN coating, the wear resistance and coefficient of friction were greatly improved in TiN + MoS x coating compared to pure TiN coating. In contrast to TiN coating, a relatively smoother wear track with less abrasive wear also supported the beneficial effects of adding MoS 2 in TiN coating...|$|R

50|$|In Hawaii, {{sugarcane}} crops {{have been}} attacked by this cricket and its tunneling activities have caused damage to the banks of irrigation ditches. In Asia, the cricket gnaws roots and tubers and causes damage to wheat, barley, oats, rice, maize, beans, vegetable crops, potatoes and sugar beet. Measures to control the pest include <b>deep</b> <b>ploughing,</b> trapping, soil fumigation, poison baits {{and the application of}} insecticides.

50|$|The {{designated}} airfield measured roughly 250 hectares. Farmers were expropriated without compensation, {{but those}} who owned herds of Heidschnucken were allowed to leave them to graze on the grasslands of the airfield. The area originally was slightly hilly and sandy, partially covered by heath as well as oak and birch trees. There was a basin containing {{the source of the}} Fintau stream {{in the middle of the}} area. Construction started by leveling and <b>deep</b> <b>ploughing</b> the land. As the sandy soil with a layer of hardpan was too infertile for the desired grass-covered airfield, plenty of peat and dung was used as fertilizer.|$|E

2500|$|Removal of ergot bodies is done {{by placing}} the yield in a brine solution; the ergot bodies float while the healthy grains sink. Infested fields need to be deep plowed; ergot cannot {{germinate}} if buried more than one inch in soil and therefore won't release its spores into the air. Rotating crops using non-susceptible plants helps reduce infestations since ergot spores only live one year. Crop rotation and deep tillage, such as <b>deep</b> moldboard <b>ploughing,</b> are important components in managing ergot, as many cereal crops in the 21st Century are sown with a [...] "no-till" [...] practice (new crops are seeded directly into the stubble from the previous crop to reduce soil erosion). Wild and escaped grasses and pastures can be mowed before they flower to help limit the spread of ergot.|$|R
