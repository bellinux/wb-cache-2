5|$|The Zong killings {{offered a}} {{powerful}} {{example of the}} <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> the slave trade, stimulating {{the development of the}} abolitionist movement in Britain, which dramatically expanded in size and influence in the late 1780s. In 1787, the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was founded.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the first}} trial, freed slave Olaudah Equiano brought {{news of the}} {{massacre}} {{to the attention of}} the anti-slavery campaigner Granville Sharp, who worked unsuccessfully to have the ship's crew prosecuted for murder. Because of the legal dispute, reports of the massacre received increased publicity, stimulating the abolitionist movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; the Zong events were increasingly cited as a powerful symbol of the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> the Middle Passage of slaves to the New World.|$|E

5|$|Nefarious: Merchant of Souls is a 2011 American {{documentary}} film about modern human trafficking, specifically sexual slavery. Presented from a Christian worldview, Nefarious covers human trafficking in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia, alternating interviews with re-enactments. Victims of trafficking talk about having been {{the objects of}} physical abuse and attempted murder. Several former prostitutes talk about their conversion to Christianity, escape from sexual oppression, and subsequent education or marriage. The film ends with the assertion that only Jesus can completely heal people from the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> sexual slavery.|$|E
5|$|As {{historian}} Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic {{claims and}} classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Żydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the most}} powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them.|$|E
5|$|Frederick's childrenWilhelm in particularheld various {{political}} positions and greatly influenced Europe. Unlike his father, Wilhelm had not personally experienced the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> war, and he enthusiastically embraced his family's military heritage, coming under Bismarck's tutelage. The Chancellor, who disapproved of Frederick's and Victoria's liberal ways, felt bound {{to increase the}} tensions between Wilhelm and his parents. Wilhelm grew up full of disdain for their opinions on government, and shortly after his father's death, proclaimed that he would follow the path of his grandfather, William I. He made no reference to Frederick III. William II abandoned all of his father's policies and ideas, and eventually led Germany into World War I.|$|E

5|$|The Sonderkommado were housed {{separately}} from other prisoners, in somewhat better conditions. Their {{quality of life}} was further improved by access to the goods taken from murdered prisoners, which Sonderkommandos were sometimes able to steal for themselves and to trade on Auschwitz's black market. Hungarian doctor Miklós Nyiszli reported that the Sonderkommando numbered around 860 prisoners when the Hungarian Jews were being killed in 1944. Many Sonderkommandos committed suicide due to the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> their work; {{those who did not}} generally were shot by the SS in a matter of weeks, and new Sonderkommando units were then formed from incoming transports. Almost none of the 2,000 prisoners placed in these units survived to the camp's liberation.|$|E
5|$|The {{cast and}} crew arrived in Sologne between February 6 and 15. Renoir's son Alain worked as an {{assistant}} camera operator and Dido Freire worked as the script girl. Renoir's assistants on the film were Koch, Zwobada and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Tony Corteggianni {{was hired as a}} technical advisor for the rabbit hunting sequence. The {{cast and crew}} stayed at Hotel Rat in Lamotte-Beuvron. Heavy rainfall prevented the start of shooting in Sologne for several weeks and Renoir rewrote parts of the script to accommodate the rain. While he finished the script the entire company played cards and bonded; they described it as a happy time in their lives just before the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> World War II began. Paulette Dubost said shooting the film was great fun.|$|E
5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post {{for more than a}} month, against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> the latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E

5|$|The postwar climate sees {{a period}} of {{austerity}} and mistrust towards the machines. Returning from the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> the war, Marke becomes the Consul of Berlin and instates a reign of isolation and deurbanization. Advanced weapons are destroyed, people are driven out into the countryside to cultivate the land, and the giant energy accumulators are destroyed. Columns {{made to look like}} bulls are erected in city squares and at crossroads, and roar twice a day like a dying animal to remind people of the catastrophe of the Ural War. Marduk succeeds Marke as the Consul and continues the period of brutal authoritarian rule.|$|E
5|$|The script {{calls for}} one actor to play both male {{characters}}Jason and the pimp. Jason and Number 18 are haunted by four voices. As poetic and prophetic voices, these characters serve {{much the same}} purpose as a chorus in Greek tragedies, according to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate. Variously considered angels or ghosts, the voices are written in the script to be played by the female actors who portray Number 18, Marta, Ali, and Mama. While these voices sometimes emphasize the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> the sex industry, at other times, they offer comfort to Number 18. It is only revealed at the play's conclusion that the chorus {{is made up of}} dead child prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce and Clarkson had {{collected}} a {{large volume of}} evidence against the slave trade over the previous two decades, and Wilberforce spent {{the latter part of}} 1806 writing A Letter on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, which was a comprehensive restatement of the abolitionists' case. The death of Fox in September 1806 was a blow, but was followed quickly by a general election in the autumn of 1806. Slavery became an election issue, bringing more abolitionist MPs into the House of Commons, including former military men who had personally experienced the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> slavery and slave revolts. Wilberforce was re-elected as an MP for Yorkshire, after which he returned to finishing and publishing his Letter, in reality a 400-page book which formed the basis for the final phase of the campaign.|$|E

5|$|Along the Western front these began quite early {{after the}} war and {{continued}} for several decades, dropping in number in the mid-1920s, when interest in the war temporarily diminished, and again in the Depression years of the early 1930s. Flemish pilgrimages to Belgium graves, particularly the heldenhuldezerkjes, and memorials began in 1919, continuing through the subsequent decades. The Ossuary at Verdun was the centre for many veterans pilgrimages in the 1920s, one of the better known groups being the Fêtes de la Bataille, which travelled to the site to undertake a vigil, processions and lay wreaths. These pilgrimages were typically low-key and avoided military symbolism or paraphernalia. Ypres became a pilgrimage destination for Britons to imagine and share the sufferings of their men and gain a spiritual benefit; the Ypres League was established by veterans, and sought to transform the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> trench warfare into a purifying spiritual quest. The Menin Gate memorial became a focal point for British pilgrims to the Western front after it was opened in 1927. Pilgrims could come long distances: in the 1920s Canadians began to journey to Vimy and Australians began visiting Gallipoli from 1925 onwards, bringing back military souvenirs relics.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Nevinson joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit and was deeply disturbed by his work tending wounded French soldiers. For a very brief period {{he served as a}} volunteer ambulance driver before ill health forced his return to Britain. Subsequently, Nevinson volunteered for home service with the Royal Army Medical Corps. He used these experiences as the subject matter for a series of powerful paintings which used the machine aesthetic of Futurism and the influence of Cubism to great effect. His fellow artist Walter Sickert wrote at the time that Nevinson's painting La Mitrailleuse, 'will probably remain the most authoritative and concentrated utterance on the war in the history of painting.' In 1917, Nevinson was appointed an official war artist, but he was no longer finding Modernist styles adequate for describing the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> modern war, and he increasingly painted in a more realistic manner. Nevinson's later World War One paintings, based on short visits to the Western Front, lacked the same powerful effect as those earlier works which had helped to make him {{one of the most famous}} young artists working in England.|$|E
