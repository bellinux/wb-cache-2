5|$|On April 27, nine of {{the fallen}} militants were buried in Erec. Some 400 ethnic Albanians {{attended}} their funerals. The dead {{ranged in age from}} seventeen to <b>forty-five</b> <b>years</b> old. Villagers claimed that some of the dead had been arrested days before their deaths and thus could not have been ambushed, as the Yugoslav authorities claimed. Such claims could not be independently verified by Western reporters. In a 1998 report, Amnesty International affirmed that the 19 men had been killed in an ambush while trying to smuggle weapons into Kosovo.|$|E
5|$|Reitz had an {{extremely}} varied political and judicial career {{that lasted for}} over <b>forty-five</b> <b>years</b> and spanned four separate political entities: the Cape Colony, the Orange Free State, the South African Republic, and the Union of South Africa. Trained as a lawyer in Cape Town and London, Reitz started off in law practice and diamond prospecting before being appointed Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. In the Orange Free State Reitz {{played an important role}} in the modernisation of the legal system and the state's administrative organisation. At the same time he was also prominent in public life, getting involved in the Afrikaner language and culture movement, and cultural life in general.|$|E

5|$|When Reid took office, Alberta was {{experiencing}} the Great Depression. Reid took measures to ease Albertans' suffering, but believed that inducing a full economic recovery {{was beyond the}} capacity of the provincial government. In this climate, Alberta voters were attracted to the economic theories of evangelical preacher William Aberhart, who advocated a version of social credit. Despite Reid's claims that Aberhart's proposals were economically and constitutionally unfeasible, Social Credit routed the UFA in the 1935 election; Reid's party did not retain a single seat. Reid lived <b>forty-five</b> <b>years</b> after his defeat, but these years were spent in obscurity; he never returned to political life.|$|E
5|$|While still a schoolboy, Massenet was {{admitted}} to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became {{best known for his}} operas. Between 1867 and his death <b>forty-five</b> <b>years</b> later he wrote more than forty stage works {{in a wide variety of}} styles, from opéra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Zieten {{served for}} the first two decades of her career with the torpedo boat flotilla. In 18781880, she was captained by Alfred von Tirpitz, the future {{architect}} of the High Seas Fleet. In 1882, she cruised the Mediterranean Sea with several other German warships, and was present during the British bombardment of Alexandria, where she protected German interests. Zieten was used as a fishery protection ship from 1899 until 1914, when the outbreak of World War I necessitated her mobilization as a coastal patrol ship. She served in this capacity {{for the duration of the}} war, and was stricken from the naval register in December 1919. The ship was finally sold for scrapping in August 1921, after <b>forty-five</b> <b>years</b> of service.|$|E

5|$|Born in Hunters Hill, Sydney, {{and educated}} locally, Gibbs was {{employed}} by the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) as a shipping clerk for <b>forty-five</b> <b>years.</b> During the Second World War, he enlisted as a private in the Second Australian Imperial Force in February 1942 and served with the 35th Battalion on home defence and patrolling duties in Sydney and Western Australia for two years. The battalion was deployed to New Guinea in January 1944 for service in the Huon Peninsula campaign, but Gibbs' overseas experience was short lived. He broke his leg {{on the day of}} arrival, and spent an extended period in hospitals in New Guinea and Australia. Discharged in December 1944, he returned to his work with AGL. In 1971, the British Government announced that the Albert Medal would be discontinued and living recipients would henceforth be regarded as holders of the George Cross. The change came into effect from 21 October, and living recipients were accordingly invited to exchange their medals; Gibbs took up the offer and formally became a recipient of the George Cross. Aged 82, Gibbs died in Bondi, New South Wales, in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Born in Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland), to assimilated Jews, Döblin {{moved with}} his mother and {{siblings}} to Berlin when he was ten years old after his father had abandoned them. Döblin would live in Berlin for the almost all of the next <b>forty-five</b> <b>years,</b> engaging with such key figures of the prewar and Weimar-era German cultural scene as Herwarth Walden and the circle of Expressionists, Bertolt Brecht, and Thomas Mann. Only a few years after his rise to literary celebrity with the 1929 publication of Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin was forced into exile by the rise of the Nazi dictatorship. He spent 1933–1940 in France and then was forced to flee again {{at the start of the}} Second World War. Like many other German émigrés he spent the war years in Los Angeles, where he converted to Catholicism. He moved to West Germany after the war but did not feel at home in postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate and returned to France. His final years were marked by poor health and financial difficulties, and his literary work was met with relative neglect.|$|E

40|$|Quadricuspid {{aortic valve}} {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} cardiac entity. The recognition of quadricuspid aortic valve has clinical significance as it leads to aortic valve dysfunction in majority, commonly aortic regurgitation, severe enough for surgical correction. Preoperative diagnosis is essential as it {{is often associated with}} other congenital cardiac abnormalities including abnormally located coronary ostia. We report a case of quadricuspid aortic valve in a <b>forty-five</b> <b>year</b> old asymptomatic male and review the available literature...|$|R

It was a third championship medal for Corbett who scored Sarsfields only goal in the game.|$|E
25|$|At first glance, the {{solution}} to the problem of how we perceive speech seems deceptively simple. If one could identify stretches of the acoustic waveform that correspond to units of perception, then the path from sound to meaning would be clear. However, this correspondence or mapping has proven extremely difficult to find, even after some <b>forty-five</b> <b>years</b> of research on the problem.|$|E
25|$|Most of Alan Pritsker’s {{groundbreaking}} {{contributions to}} engineering theory, methodology and practice {{are widely available}} via numerous well-known texts and book chapters that he wrote {{over a period of}} <b>forty-five</b> <b>years.</b> Perhaps more than any other single individual, he effectively disseminated knowledge about simulation technology at all levels of academia, government and industry through the publication of twelve popular textbooks.|$|E
25|$|From January 1906 Vanity Fair used {{a number}} of other (probably cheaper) firms to produce their caricatures. This {{decision}} was reversed in 1911 with the arrival of editor Thomas Allinson who, struggling with the now failing magazine, wished to revert to the process whereby 'the most satisfactory results' had been obtained. Vanity Fair magazine finally ceased publication in 1914. Its <b>forty-five</b> <b>year</b> run of caricatures ended as Allinson absorbed it into his Hearth and Home magazine.|$|R
50|$|Five {{years later}} Mulcahy was left corner-back of the Midleton senior team that bridged a <b>forty-five</b> <b>year</b> gap {{to qualify for}} the {{championship}} decider. The opponents, St. Finbarr's, were appearing in their fifth successive decider and were hoping to secure fourth championship in-a-row. A 1-18 to 2-9 victory gave Midleton their first title since 1916, while Mulcahy collected his first championship medal. He later collected a Munster medal following a 1-14 to 1-11 defeat of Borris-Ileigh in the provincial decider.|$|R
50|$|Born into a {{theatrical}} family, Blanche made her stage debut {{at the age}} of fourteen and had a <b>forty-five</b> <b>year</b> career, almost exclusively on the British stage, in the West End and on tour. In the 1890s she was a leading principal boy in London's most lavishly staged pantomimes. In the 20th century her career changed to playing comic, formidable older women. Her most celebrated role of this kind was in the hit musical The Arcadians (1909), staged by her brother-in-law Robert Courtneidge.|$|R
25|$|Chinese {{students}} {{sent to the}} United States generally {{were not}} typical undergraduates or graduate students but were mid-career scientists, often thirty-five to <b>forty-five</b> <b>years</b> of age, seeking advanced training in their areas of specialization. Often they were individuals of exceptional ability who occupied responsible positions in Chinese universities and research institutions. Fewer than 15 percent of the earliest arrivals were degree candidates. Nearly all the visiting scholars were in scientific fields.|$|E

25|$|Amenemhat I built a {{new capital}} for Egypt, Itjtawy, thought to be located near the present-day Lisht, {{although}} Manetho claims the capital remained at Thebes.

His son Senusret I continued the policy of his father to recapture Nubia and other territories lost during the First Intermediate Period. The Libu were subdued under his <b>forty-five</b> <b>year</b> reign and Egypt's prosperity and security were secured.|$|R
25|$|LaHaye {{believed}} that the Illuminati is secretly engineering world affairs.
