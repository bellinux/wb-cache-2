40|$|Two {{differential}} (dual input, single output) drives (a roller-gear and a pure roller), and {{a momentum}} balanced (single input, dual output) drive (pure roller) were designed, fabricated, and tested. The <b>differential</b> <b>drives</b> are each rated at 295 rad/sec (2800 rpm) input speed, 450 N-m (4, 000 in-lbf) output torque. The momentum balanced drive is rated at 302 rad/sec (2880 rpm) input speed, and dual output torques of 434 N-m (3840 in-lbf). The Dual Input <b>Differential</b> Roller-Gear <b>Drive</b> (DC- 700) has a planetary roller-gear {{system with a}} reduction ratio (one input driving the output with the second input fixed) of 29. 23 : 1. The Dual Input <b>Differential</b> Roller <b>Drive</b> (DC- 500) has a planetary roller system with a reduction ratio of approximately 24 : 1. Each of the <b>differential</b> <b>drives</b> features dual roller-gear or roller arrangements consisting of a sun, four first row planets, four second row planets, and a ring. The Momentum Balanced (Grounded Ring) Drive (DC- 400) has a planetary roller system with a reduction ratio of 24 : 1 with both outputs counterrotating at equal speed. Its single roller cluster consists of a sun, five first and five second row planets, a roller cage or spider and a ring. Outputs are taken from both the roller cage and the ring which counterrotate. Test results reported for all three drives include angular and torque ripple (linearity and cogging), viscous and Coulomb friction, and forward and reverse power efficiency. Of the two <b>differential</b> <b>drives,</b> the <b>Differential</b> Roller <b>Drive</b> had better linearity and less cogging than did the <b>Differential</b> Roller-Gear <b>Drive,</b> but it had higher friction and lower efficiency (particularly at low power throughput levels). Use of full preloading rather than a variable preload system in the <b>Differential</b> Roller <b>Drive</b> assessed a heavy penalty in part load efficiency. Maximum measured efficiency (ratio of power out to power in) was 95 % for the <b>Differential</b> Roller-Gear <b>Drive</b> and 86 % for the <b>Differential</b> Roller <b>Drive.</b> The Momentum Balanced (Grounded Ring) Drive performed as expected kinematically. Reduction r-atios to the two counterrotating outputs (design nominal= 24 : 1) were measured to be 23. 98 : 1 and 24. 12 : 1 at zero load [...] At 25 ONm (2200 in-lbf) output torque the ratio changed 2 % due to roller creep. This drive was the smoothest of all three as determined from linearity and cogging tests, and maximum measured efficiency (ratio of power out to power in) was 95 %. The disadvantages of full preloading as comvared to variable preload were apparent in this drive as in the <b>Differential</b> Roller <b>Drive.</b> Efficiencies at part load were low, but improved dramatically with increases in torque. These were consistent with friction measurements which indicated losses primarily from Coulomb friction. The initial preload level setting was low so roller slip was encountered at higher torques during testing...|$|R
