5|$|A sound <b>film</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{motion picture}} with {{synchronized}} sound, or sound technologically coupled to image, {{as opposed to}} a silent film. The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades passed before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923.|$|E

5|$|Christie's {{sacrifice}} in the <b>film</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> heavily criticized plot element, with critics from online publications such as Cracked.com and Bloody Disgusting calling it avoidable and unnecessary. In Keyframes: Popular Cinema and Cultural Studies, Matthew Tinkcom and Amy Villarejo write that Christie reinforces an Alien-franchise trope (shared by Parker in Alien and Dillon in Alien 3) where black characters save and sacrifice themselves for Caucasian characters. The theme of hybridization is exemplified by Christie and Vriess, according to Rizzo in Deleuze and Film: A Feminist Introduction; {{while the two}} characters are harnessed together, they alternate movement, support and combat.|$|E
