5000|$|A {{close look}} at the fixed duct support photo shows several {{properties}} or round ring supports. 1) there are stiffeners at roughly 60 degrees on center. This duct ring is fabricated from 2 rolled WT's, welded at the center. This is a smaller duct, with light loads, so that the bottom flange was slightly modified by support clearance requirements. A small gap is shown for placing the duct PTFE slide bearing, although a fixed support could also be inserted in this gap. In the background of this photo is a duct flange. The duct flange normally has 3/4" [...] bolts at 6" [...] nominal; spacing. Duct flange angle thickness needs to be designed for duct plate tensile stresses, as flanges will bend. 5/16" [...] or 3/8" [...] angle thicknesses are common. [...] See above photo of round duct elbows, transitions, and stiffeners. The duct elbow radius, are from 1 1/2 to 2 times the duct diameter. The round duct has ovaling, and shipping rings at 20 foot nominal spacing, and larger support rings at supports. The Y split has suction stiffeners at the duct intersection.

5000|$|Pearsall {{worked with}} Honeywell Corporation as a {{heating and air}} {{conditioning}} sales engineer for seven years before founding the Pearsall Company in 1955. Pearsall founded Statitrol Corporation in Lakewood, Colorado in 1963. A few months later Lyman Blackwell, one of Pearsall's engineers at Statitrol, improvised a test to measure the flow of ions in an airstream discharging from a generator. When a technician, smoking nearby, casually exhaled smoke into the <b>fan</b> <b>inlet</b> of the generator, the ion meter pegged. Pearsall immediately realized that the basic ionization technology of this device could also be used for smoke detection. This accidental discovery was similar to a discovery made by Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger in the late 1930s. In 1965 Pearsall began the long process to develop and market a home smoke detector powered by a battery which could be easily installed and replaced. These first units were dubbed [...] "SmokeGard 700," [...] Pearsall was awarded a design patent for this in 1973, and began mass-producing them in 1975. Shortly afterwards, he began working with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). His work with NFPA would eventually lead to the change of the uniform building codes to require smoke detectors in new construction. Statitrol sold the smoke detector invention to Emerson Electric in 1980.|$|E

Temperature transients were controlled by varying the magnitude and rate of change of the inlet temperature rise. The engine response ranged from a momentary compressor pressure disturbance to low-pressure-compressor stall. The compressor distortion limits decreased with decreasing low-pressure-rotor speed and increased with increasing circumferential extent of distortion.

40|$|Positive {{pressure}} ventilation was investigated. Forty-three {{experiments were}} performed on the first, second, and third floors of a three-storey brick building with wooden trusses. The objectives of the experiments were to investigate the effects of distance between <b>fan</b> and <b>inlet,</b> size and numbers of outlets, and volume of building on vent flow rates when using positive pressure ventilation. Four different fans from two different manufacturers with varying characteristics were used. Airflow through outlets was measured. The results shows that flow rate through an exhaust increases with increasing distance between <b>fan</b> and <b>inlet</b> up to some maximum value and a decreasing flow rate after this point. Also, flow rate through an exhaust decreases as volume of the structure increases. In a larger volume more leakage can be expected, thus decreasing the efficiency of positive pressure ventilation.

The number of exhaust openings affects the volumetric flow rate in a nonlinear manner...|$|R

40|$|The {{difference}} between the flight and ground static noise of turbofan engines {{has been identified as}} a significant problem in engine noise testing.

These potential flow calculations indicated that there was substantial flow over the wall directly behind the <b>fan</b> <b>inlet</b> that could produce significant inflow disturbances. Fan noise tests were run with various extensions added to the <b>fan</b> <b>inlet</b> to move the inlet away from this backwall and thereby reduce the inlet flow disturbances.

40|$|Attenuation {{properties}} of three treated <b>fan</b> <b>inlets</b> were evaluated in the NASA-Lewis Anechoic Wind Tunnel using a subsonic tip speed, 50. 8 cm-diameter fan. Tunnel flow simulated the inflow clean-up effect on source noise observed in flight and allowed {{observation of the}} blade passage frequency tone cut-off phenomenon. Acoustic data consisted of isolated inlet noise measured in the far field at two positions and with traverses at four frequencies. Averaged attenuation properties showed relative agreement of the inlets with their design intent; however, tunnel flow significantly affected the attenuation spectra. With no tunnel flow the strong blade passage tone was more highly attenuated than the adjacent broadband noise. With tunnel flow, when cut-off was observed, the attenuation at the tone frequency was comparable to that for broadband noise. Tunnel flow increased by several dB the maximum attenuation occurring at midfrequencies of the attenuation spectra. The combined effect of tunnel flow on attenuation and source noise resulted in suppressed fan noise levels throughout the spectra. Tunnel flow caused some substantial directivity variations that are interpreted as acoustic mode changes, with tunnel flow generally reducing the proportion of modes near cut-off...|$|R

High resolution PIV measurements provide reliable aerodynamic measurements forming a validation basis for further analytical and computational design studies.
