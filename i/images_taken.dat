5|$|On April 25, 2007, the AIM {{satellite}} (Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere) was launched. It is {{the first}} satellite dedicated to studying noctilucent clouds, and made its first observations on May 25, 2007. <b>Images</b> <b>taken</b> by the satellite show shapes in the clouds {{that are similar to}} shapes in tropospheric clouds, hinting at similarities in their dynamics.|$|E
5|$|All {{images from}} Hubble are {{monochromatic}} grayscale, in which its cameras incorporate {{a variety of}} filters each passing specific wavelengths of light. Color images are created by combining separate monochrome <b>images</b> <b>taken</b> through different filters. This process can also create false-color versions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels, where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue.|$|E

5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate <b>images</b> <b>taken</b> at different orientations of the crystal. The {{first step is to}} merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E
5|$|Between November 27, 2006, and April 1, 2007, 3329 {{images of}} the star WASP-13 by the SuperWASP-North program based at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands led to the {{identification}} of WASP-13 as host to a potentially transiting object. Photometric follow-up observations were taken on February 16, 2008 using the James Gregory Telescope (JGT) in Scotland, which took 1047 exposures of the star, although the last twenty <b>images</b> <b>taken</b> were obscured by cloud cover and were discarded. Using HD 80408 as a reference star along with JGT measurements, the astronomers investigating the system were {{able to create a}} light curve for the transiting planet.|$|E

5|$|By 1978, nine {{distinct}} rings were identified. Two additional rings {{were discovered}} in 1986 in <b>images</b> <b>taken</b> by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, and two outer rings were found in 2003–2005 in Hubble Space Telescope photos. In the order of increasing distance from the planet the 13 known rings are designated 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν and μ. Their radii range from about 38,000km for the 1986U2R/ζ ring to about 98,000km for the μ ring. Additional faint dust bands and incomplete arcs may exist between the main rings. The rings are extremely dark—the Bond albedo of the rings' particles does not exceed 2%. They are probably composed of water ice {{with the addition of}} some dark radiation-processed organics.|$|E
5|$|Ground-based radio <b>images</b> <b>taken</b> {{using the}} VLA {{revealed}} seven radio {{sources in the}} HDF, all of which correspond to galaxies visible in the optical images. The field has also been surveyed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and the MERLIN array of radio telescopes at 1.4GHz; the combination of VLA and MERLIN maps made at wavelengths of 3.5 and 20cm have located 16 radio sources in the HDF-N field, with many more in the flanking fields. Radio images of some individual sources in the field have been made with the European VLBI Network at 1.6GHz with a higher resolution than the Hubble maps.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{outreach}} {{efforts are}} coordinated by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Office for Public Outreach, {{which was established}} in 2000 to ensure that U.S. taxpayers saw the benefits of their investment in the space telescope program. To that end, STScI operates the HubbleSite.org website. The Hubble Heritage Project, operating out of the STScI, provides the public with high-quality images {{of the most interesting}} and striking objects observed. The Heritage team is composed of amateur and professional astronomers, as well as people with backgrounds outside astronomy, and emphasizes the aesthetic nature of Hubble images. The Heritage Project is granted a small amount of time to observe objects which, for scientific reasons, may not have <b>images</b> <b>taken</b> at enough wavelengths to construct a full-color image.|$|E

5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar images of a geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar <b>images</b> <b>taken</b> on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E
5|$|The comet {{continued}} to fade as it receded, {{but is still}} being tracked by astronomers. In October 2007, 10 years after the perihelion and at distance of 25.7 AU from Sun, the comet was still active {{as indicated by the}} detection of the CO-driven coma. Herschel Space Observatory <b>images</b> <b>taken</b> in 2010 suggest comet Hale–Bopp is covered in a fresh frost layer. Hale–Bopp was again detected in December 2010 when it was 30.7 AU away from the Sun, and on August 7, 2012 at a 33.2 AU distance from the Sun. Astronomers expect that the comet will remain observable with large telescopes until perhaps 2020, by which time it will be nearing 30thmagnitude. By this time it will become very difficult to distinguish the comet from the large numbers of distant galaxies of similar brightness.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} evening Djorgovski again {{observed the}} region. He compared the images from both nights but the error box contained no objects that had decreased in luminosity between May8 and May9. Metzger noticed one object that had increased in luminosity, but he {{assumed it was}} a variable star rather than the GRB afterglow. Titus Galama and Paul Groot, members of a research team in Amsterdam led by Jan van Paradijs, compared <b>images</b> <b>taken</b> by the WIYN Telescope on May8 and the William Herschel Telescope on May9.

5|$|Titan was {{examined}} by both Voyager 1 and 2 in 1980 and 1981, respectively. Voyager 1s trajectory {{was designed to}} provide an optimized Titan flyby, during which the spacecraft was able to determine the density, composition, and temperature of the atmosphere, and obtain a precise measurement of Titan's mass. Atmospheric haze prevented direct imaging of the surface, though in 2004 intensive digital processing of <b>images</b> <b>taken</b> through Voyager 1s orange filter did reveal hints of the light and dark features now known as Xanadu and Shangri-la, which had been observed in the infrared by the Hubble Space Telescope. Voyager 2, {{which would have been}} diverted to perform the Titan flyby if Voyager 1 had been unable to, did not pass near Titan and continued on to Uranus and Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Two teams claim {{credit for}} the {{discovery}} of Haumea. Mike Brown and his team at Caltech discovered Haumea in December 2004 on images they had taken on May 6, 2004. On July 20, 2005, they published an online abstract of a report intended to announce the discovery {{at a conference in}} September 2005. At around this time, José Luis Ortiz Moreno and his team at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía at Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain found Haumea on <b>images</b> <b>taken</b> on March 7–10, 2003. Ortiz emailed the Minor Planet Center with their discovery on the night of July 27, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the vast}} {{size of its}} coma, Halley's nucleus is {{relatively}} small: barely 15kilometers long, 8kilometers wide and perhaps 8kilometers thick. Its shape vaguely resembles that of a peanut. Its mass is relatively low (roughly 2.2kg) and its average density is about 0.6g/cm3, indicating that it is made {{of a large number}} of small pieces, held together very loosely, forming a structure known as a rubble pile. Ground-based observations of coma brightness suggested that Halley's rotation period was about 7.4 days. <b>Images</b> <b>taken</b> by the various spacecraft, along with observations of the jets and shell, suggested a period of 52hours. Given the irregular shape of the nucleus, Halley's rotation is likely to be complex. Although only 25% of Halley's surface was imaged in detail during the flyby missions, the images revealed an extremely varied topography, with hills, mountains, ridges, depressions, and at least one crater.|$|E
