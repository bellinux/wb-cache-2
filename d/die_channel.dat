Microtexture data were acquired by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) following one pass and four repetitive passes by route A. In a 90 ◦ die with zero relief angle, the microtexture data indicate that ECAP involves simple shear on a shear plane and in a shear direction that are rotated away from the plane of the <b>die</b> <b>channel</b> intersection toward the die exit channel. This rotation reflects the spreading of shear deformation through a fan-shaped region around the plane of the <b>die</b> <b>channel</b> intersection. The superposition of backpressure suppresses this spreading and the texture data indicate that deformation is confined to the plane of the <b>die</b> <b>channel</b> intersection, while the introduction of a relief angle at the outer corner of the <b>die</b> <b>channel</b> intersection promotes spreading and leads to further rotation of the shear plane and shear direction toward the axis of the die exit channel. Splitting of shear texture components is observed after the initial ECAP pass. Such splitting appears in the microstructure as band-like features separated by sub-grains. Band-like features became apparent in the microstructure after the initial pass and persisted through four ECAP passes by route A; these features become more prominent with increasing die relief angle...|$|E

30|$|For rateless codes {{over the}} <b>dying</b> <b>channel,</b> {{the topic of}} good {{intermediate}} performance of rateless codes would be widely studied. The author of [19] firstly investigated the intermediate performance of LT codes through deriving the asymptotic error probability and provided a tight outer bound on the proportion of recoverable symbols. Building {{on the basis of}} [19], the authors in [20] presented two new methods (degree distribution optimization and encoded symbol sorting) to maximize the intermediate symbol recovery rate of rateless coding. However, in their work, the different degree distributions were needed to match the different numbers of received encoded symbols, which may cause the transmitting system more complex. The investigation on rateless codes over <b>dying</b> <b>channel</b> was firstly presented in [21]. The authors optimized the degree distribution of LT codes for both partial and full recovery situations, aiming to match the stochastic channel life span. But their model failed to consider a constituting procedure of large file transmission over multiple connections or multiple channel states over the <b>dying</b> <b>channels.</b> The authors of [22] proposed a new rateless code, named the growth codes, to improve intermediate performance and to maximize video transmission quality over error resilient channels. The transmitter continuously adapts the degree of the encoded symbols to guarantee that each received encoded packet has the highest instantaneous recoverable probability. The online fountain codes [23] is another class of rateless codes designed for higher intermediate performance. The lower redundancy overhead of online fountain codes is the most important improvement over the growth codes, and the feedback cost is roughly half that of growth codes. But the common drawback of growth codes and online codes is that feedback signal is required to inform the alterations of the decoding states in transmission process, in order to change an optimal encoding strategy at the transmitter, which may not be easily employed in some practical SATCOM networks.|$|R
