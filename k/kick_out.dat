5|$|The fourth match (which {{received}} a pre-match endorsement from Stephanie McMahon) featured Paige retaining her NXT Women's Championship over Emma. Paige managed to prevent Emma from applying her Emma Lock submission hold during the match and also withstood several other holds applied by Emma. When Paige attempted a superplex, Emma countered with a sitout powerbomb on Paige, {{but it was}} not enough to secure a win. A frustrated Emma slapped Paige, who retaliated with her signature Paige Turner. Yet, Emma became the first person to <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> of the Paige Turner. Paige responded by applying the Paige Tapout submission hold, which was enough for the victory when Emma submitted. Paige embraced Emma after the match.|$|E

5|$|A week later, Arsenal {{travelled}} to face Manchester United at Old Trafford. Pirès and Wiltord {{were dropped}} by Wenger {{in favour of}} Ray Parlour and Ljungberg; Campbell did not travel due to family bereavement. In the 80th minute, Vieira was sent off for a second bookable offence; he attempted to <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> at striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, which was seen by referee Steve Bennett. With the score 0–0, United were awarded a penalty in the 90th minute, but Van Nistelrooy's spot kick hit the bar and rebounded back into play. At the final whistle, Van Nistelrooy was immediately confronted by several Arsenal players, which escalated into an altercation between both teams. Six of Arsenal's players (Ashley Cole, Lauren, Keown, Parlour, Lehmann, Vieira) were later charged with improper conduct by The Football Association (FA), while the club were fined £175,000, the largest ever given to a club by the FA. Lauren received a four-game ban, whereas Vieira and Parlour were given one-match suspensions.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{normally}} nest in crevices between {{or under}} rocks, or burrow in the soil. When {{they make their}} own tunnels, they loosen the earth with their bills and <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> the debris with their feet. The birds less commonly nest in walls, under buildings or down rabbit burrows. Disused or occupied burrows of Atlantic puffins and Manx shearwaters are sometimes used, and the petrel pair may share a common entrance with those seabirds, rabbits or other pairs of its own species. Where other occupants are present, the petrels dig a side burrow or use an existing low-roofed tunnel which the larger birds or rabbits cannot easily enter. Even so, puffins and shearwaters will sometimes access and destroy nests, and adult petrels may be killed by their larger neighbours. Human-made plastic nesting tubes are readily used, and may provide protection against predators. Birds usually mate for life and use the same hole every year.|$|E
5|$|As {{in falls}} one and two, Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out against each other. At one point, Guerrero applied Hijo del Santo's own {{submission}} hold, La de a Caballo (camel clutch), {{on him to}} mock his opponent, but {{was not able to}} make Hijo del Santo submit before Octagón saved his partner. Later in the fall, with the referee distracted, Barr was able to surprise Octagón and execute a kneeling reverse piledriver, a move that would have been an automatic disqualification in Lucha Libre. Moments later, Barr was able to pin Octagón to eliminate him from the match. In Lucha Libre, the piledriver is treated as a very dangerous move, something that was sold during this match by Octagón being taken from the arena on a stretcher during the closing moments of the third fall. Minutes later, Hijo del Santo was actually able to <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> of the Superplex/Frog Splash combo by La Pareja del Terror. At one point, both Hijo del Santo and Guerrero were on the floor, which distracted the referee long enough for Blue Panther to enter the ring and perform a piledriver of his own on Barr in retaliation for what was done to Octagón. The move was not seen by the referee but allowed Hijo del Santo to pin Barr, leaving just Hijo del Santo and Guerrero still in the match. A minute or two later, Hijo del Santo was able to roll up Guerrero for the final pinfall and the victory for his team. Following their loss, both Guerrero and Barr visibly cried in the ring, selling the severeness of the loss as they cut off each other's hair with a pair of scissors. This was followed by an AAA official shaving off the rest of their hair with electric clippers backstage.|$|E

5|$|Like {{almost all}} Coraciiformes the bee-eaters are cavity nesters. In {{the case of}} the bee-eaters the nests are burrows dug into the ground, either into the sides of earth cliffs or {{directly}} into level soil. Both types of nesting site are vulnerable, those on level ground are vulnerable to trampling and small predators, whereas those in cliffs, which are often the banks of rivers, are vulnerable to flash floods, which can wipe out dozens or hundreds of nests. Many species will nest either on cliffs or on level ground but prefer cliffs, although Böhm's bee-eater always nests on level ground. The burrows are dug by both birds in the pair, sometimes assisted by helpers. The soil or sand is loosened with jabs of the sharp bill, then the feet are used to <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> the loose soil. It has been suggested that riverine loess deposits that do not crumble when excavated may be favoured by the larger bee-eaters. There may be several false starts where nests are dug partway before being abandoned; in solitary species this can give the impression of colonial living even when that is not the case. The process of nest building can take as long as twenty days to complete, during which time the bill can be blunted and shortened. Nests are generally used only for a single season and are rarely used twice by the bee-eaters, but abandoned nests may be used by other birds, snakes and bats as shelter and breeding sites.|$|E

25|$|Tensions and {{excitement}} were {{high as the}} wrestlers and officials congregated for Survivor Series. Hart was anxious over the match finish and had been warned of {{the prospect of a}} screwjob by his brother-in-law and Hart Foundation member Davey Boy Smith as well as Vader, who had experienced similar situations while wrestling in Japan. They advised Hart to be alert, not lie on his back for too long, <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> from pinfall counts immediately so as to avoid a fast count, and not allow himself to be placed in submission holds.|$|E
25|$|In combat, Frodo {{has access}} to three melee weapons at {{different}} stages in the game. Initially, he is armed with a walking stick. Later, he acquires a dagger, and finally, he can use the short sword Sting. Frodo can also throw stones, and can turn invisible for limited periods of time by using the One Ring. Aragorn is initially armed with a basic longsword, but later acquires Andúril. He also possesses a bow, and he can <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> at enemies. Gandalf uses his sword Glamdring and has several magical abilities, such as a fire attack, chain lightning and healing. The player can also switch to first-person view {{at any time during}} the game. This can help targeting when Frodo is throwing stones or Aragorn is firing arrows. Movement during first-person view is limited to strafing left and right.|$|E
25|$|In {{the main}} event, Diesel defended the WWF World Championship in a Lumberjack match. After {{back and forth}} action {{during the first few}} minutes, which {{included}} each wrestler being attacked by opposing lumberjacks, Diesel performed a suicide dive over the top rope onto all of Sid's lumberjacks. The champion continued to attack Sid's lumberjacks, but King Mabel intervened, tossing Diesel into the steel steps. Sid attempted to capitalize by performing his finishing move, the Powerbomb. Instead of pinning his opponent, Sid high fived his lumberjacks on the outside, giving Diesel time to recover and <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> at the two-count. After a second attempted Powerbomb by Sid was countered, the match spilled outside of the ring: Sid got into a brawl with Diesel's lumberjacks. Shawn Michaels, one of Diesel's lumberjacks hit Sid with a double axe handle off the top rope. Some of Sid's lumberjacks, including Tatanka and Irwin R. Schyster, attacked Diesel, who fought them off. Diesel performed a big boot, pinning Sid to retain the WWF Championship. Diesel celebrated with his lumberjacks after the match ended.|$|E

25|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Unforgiven was between Triple H and Goldberg over the World Heavyweight Championship. One month prior at SummerSlam, Triple H won an Elimination Chamber match {{to retain the}} World Heavyweight Championship by last {{eliminating}} Goldberg. After the match ended, Triple H, along with Evolution members Ric Flair and Randy Orton, handcuffed Goldberg to the Chamber and attacked him with a sledgehammer. The next night on Raw, Goldberg challenged Triple H to a match later that night. Triple H declined {{and said that they}} would face off at Unforgiven instead. Triple H then added the stipulation that if he won, Goldberg would have to retire from professional wrestling. On the September 1 episode of Raw, Goldberg, Shawn Michaels, and Maven defeated Evolution (Triple H, Randy Orton, and Ric Flair). Towards the end of the match, Orton attacked Goldberg from behind as he was preparing to spear Triple H. Goldberg was able to <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> of the pinfall attempt and hit Orton with a Jackhammer for the win. The next week on Raw, Co-General Manager Steve Austin added the stipulation where if Triple H got himself counted out or intentionally disqualified, he would lose the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
25|$|The sixth {{match was}} a {{standard}} {{match for the}} NWA World Television Championship. Sting defended the title against The Great Muta. Sting started the ring by flying over the ropes onto Muta in the second ring. Muta's manager Gary Hart distracted Sting, allowing Muta to deliver a Judo Chop. Muta tried to deliver a Moonsault for the victory but Sting {{moved out of the}} way. Muta started dominating the match but Sting delivered a Clothesline to gain advantage. Sting dropkicked Muta down and the two continued to exchange momentum and moves. The match started to change when Muta tried to deliver a Red Mist to Sting but Sting moved out and the referee Nick Patrick was hit with it. Sting attacked Muta and tried to deliver a Stinger Splash but Muta avoided it and delivered a Moonsault. Tommy Young replaced Nick Patrick as the referee and entered the ring to count the pinfall for Muta but Sting kicked out at 2 and became the first wrestler to <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> of Moonsault. Muta tried to deliver a Spin Kick but Sting countered it and delivered him a Belly To Back Suplex to win the match and retain the title. However, controversy surrounded the match as both men had their shoulders up at two count. The referees argued over it and Muta stole the title belt.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} was between Vader (accompanied by Harley Race) and Ric Flair for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Flair {{would have to}} retire from {{professional}} wrestling if he lost. The match started with Vader having the advantage with attacks. After Vader performed a gorilla press slam, Flair rolled outside the ring, and Vader performed a gorilla press drop onto the guard rail. Vader then missed an attack, {{and ran into the}} guard rail. Flair fought back, and sent Vader into the ringpost. Race then attacked Flair, and Vader regained the advantage. Vader dominated Flair, performing a superplex and a body avalanche. Flair fought back, and sent Vader's left leg into the ringpost. Flair attacked the leg with a chair, and continued to target the leg. After Vader missed a corner slingshot splash, Flair applied the figure four leglock. Vader reached the ropes, and fought back, but missed a moonsault. Flair attempted to pin Vader while Race climbed the turnbuckle Vader jumped from. Race attempted a diving headbutt to break up the pin, but Vader powered Flair off of him to <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> just as Race jumped and as a result the champion took the diving headbutt from his manager. After referee Randy Anderson threw Race out of the ring, Flair hit a running forearm smash on Vader then proceeded to chop the champion repeatedly. Flair then attempted another running maneuver only to be met with a bell clap from Vader. Flair then grabbed Vader's left leg, causing him to trip and fall, and pinned him with a roll-up to win the match and the title.|$|E

40|$|How {{to improve}} the {{transfer}} capability of the weighted networks {{is one of the}} most important problems in complex networks. In this paper, a novel and effective routing strategy is proposed by deleting edges in proper order according to their different definitions of edge weight. <b>Kicking</b> <b>out</b> few specified edges can enhance the transfer capability of weighted networks greatly. Simulations on both compute generated and real world networks show that the routing strategy <b>kicking</b> <b>out</b> edges according to the product of the strengths of two nodes of the edge is more effective. Moreover, we analyse the curve of critical packet generation rate of <b>kicking</b> <b>out</b> all deletable edges and find that there is a sharp transition after <b>kicking</b> <b>out</b> some edges. Due to the strongly improved network capacity, easy realization on networks, and low cost, the strategy may be useful for real communication networks...|$|R

25|$|On November 8, 1997, one {{day before}} Survivor Series, McMahon met with Pat Patterson and Michaels {{in a hotel room}} in Montreal and planned the screwjob. It is unclear how many people knew of the {{impending}} screwjob, but McMahon's close aides Gerald Brisco and Sgt. Slaughter had been involved in the planning. Jim Ross has insisted {{that he did not know}} the screwjob would take place, although many, including various members of Hart's family, thought he was involved. In a radio interview, Ross also confirmed that Jerry Lawler also did not know that the screwjob would take place. Hart and Michaels had met with Pat Patterson to discuss the match setup and plan, during which Hart agreed to allow Michaels to put him into the Sharpshooter hold at a time when the referee would be unconscious, as Patterson suggested. The rest of the match was planned to proceed thus: Hart would grab Michaels' foot and reverse the hold, putting him in the Sharpshooter. Michaels would submit to the hold, but the referee would still be unconscious. Hart would let go of the hold to try to revive the referee, but Michaels would hit Hart with his finisher, Sweet Chin Music, and make the pin. A second referee would then run to the ring with Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Davey Boy Smith following close behind. The second referee would start the count, but Owen and Davey Boy would break the pin. The original referee would then recover and start to make the count, but Hart would <b>kick</b> <b>out,</b> setting up about five more minutes of brawling that would result in a disqualification.|$|E
