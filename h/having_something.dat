5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as <b>having</b> <b>something</b> wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore {{it is not uncommon for}} bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E

By the same token, convoluted or non-linear features hinder spirit movement i.e. labyrinths and mazes.|$|E

Characters earn a Hero Point every time they get a Quality 1 result on a skill other than combat, also when the GM chooses to award one for a clever or dramatic action.

25|$|Cadbury {{has enjoyed}} a {{substantial}} fan base in India. The Dairy Milk primarily is a huge success. Initially, the company had appointed Amithabh Bhachan as the brand ambassador in 2004. However the brand soon faced a significant backlash with worms being spotted in the chocolate bars. With its new campaigns however the company did get back on its feet. Cadbury {{is known for its}} marketing campaigns in India that have known to instill a sense of playfulness and innocence with its campaigns. One campaign that promoted the product by using the country's love for cricket was very successful. The ad is noted to be the best advertisement made in India by the Times of India. Another famous campaign hosted by the company in the past was the 'Shubh Aarambh' Campaign. This campaign made use of the traditional practice of Indian households of <b>having</b> <b>something</b> sweet before every auspicious occasion. It is a traditional belief that this leads to a favourable outcome for the people. This campaign was also a huge hit and positioned Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolates as part of a family name. Cadbury today holds 70% of the market share of the chocolate industry in the country.|$|E

Still, it is rare in Europe's fairy tales for a cat to be so closely {{involved}} with human affairs. According to Jacob Grimm, Puss shares many of the features that a household fairy or deity would have including a desire for boots which could represent seven-league boots.

500|$|The reveal of Tracer being canonically lesbian was {{generally}} well-received by media outlets and players alike. USgamer called it [...] "an impressive move for Blizzard, given that Tracer is their flagship character". Polygons Allegra Frank described the reveal as one [...] "that fans have waited a long, long time for". Peter Amato of Paste commented, [...] "While a vocal minority has made their disapproval of said announcement clear, the larger fan base's reaction has ranged from indifferent to cheering." [...] Kotaku had {{several of its}} writers react to the reveal, with the consensus being a positive reception. The publication's Cecilia D'Anastasio pointed to a previous statement from Blizzard, where the developers clarified their intention to have an LGBT character reveal play out organically, [...] commenting: [...] "I feel that the comic did that. Tracer buys her partner a scarf. Her partner likes it. They kiss. The comic moves on. I think it was handled quite well, {{although the idea of}} Blizzard announcing a queer character feels sort of.... gimmicky." [...] Gita Jackson concurred with D'Anastasio stating she [...] "was definitely concerned that revealing a queer character would come off as a gimmick, and [...] very pleased at how they pulled this off. This doesn't feel tokenized." [...] Fellow Kotaku writer Heather Alexandra commented, [...] "I think <b>having</b> <b>something</b> explicit was necessary [...] <b>Having</b> <b>something</b> definite gives queer players a proper point of contact." [...] Andy Chalk of PC Gamer noted that: ...the comic itself is a fairly straightforward heartwarming tale of what really matters during the most hectic season of all. But the reaction to Tracer's identity has been anything but. Messages decrying Blizzard's [...] "mistake" [...] have cropped up all over the Overwatch forums and other social media, countered by others praising the studio for explicitly stating—in a low-key fashion—that the face of one of the biggest games of the year is gay.|$|E
500|$|Fragile Allegiance was {{generally}} well received, achieving average to good scores from reviewers. It was praised for its graphics and icon driven interface which was considered slick and well integrated {{but a little}} confusing at first. Reviewers noted that after figuring out what all the icons did the game was immensely engrossing, with the player always <b>having</b> <b>something</b> to do. The game was criticised for its difficulty, its simplistic combat model, the time spent transporting ore between asteroids, and {{the large amount of}} micromanagement involved when the player's empire got large — although reviewers noted that the latter two could be countered by the [...] "Ore Teleporter blueprint" [...] and Colony Supervisors respectively. There were mixed feelings regarding the replacing of research with the Sci-Tek blueprint system, which meant that any blueprint could be bought in any order provided the player had the money to do so.|$|E
500|$|Apart from {{a single}} early work for unaccompanied choir ("Chanson à boire", 1922), Poulenc began writing choral music in 1936. In that year he {{produced}} three works for choir: Sept chansons (settings of verses by Éluard and others), Petites voix (for children's voices), and his religious work Litanies à la Vierge Noire, for female or children's voices and organ. The Mass in G major (1937) for unaccompanied choir is described by Gouverné as <b>having</b> <b>something</b> of a baroque style, with [...] "vitality and joyful clamour on which his faith is writ large". Poulenc's new-found religious theme continued with Quatre motets pour un temps de pénitence (1938–39), but among his most important choral works is the secular cantata Figure humaine (1943). Like the Mass, it is unaccompanied, and to succeed in performance it requires singers of the highest quality. Other a cappella works include the Quatre motets pour le temps de Noël (1952), which make severe demands on choirs' rhythmic precision and intonation.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the abnormal movements of other movement disorders (for example, choreas, dystonias, myoclonus, and dyskinesias), the tics of Tourette's are temporarily suppressible, nonrhythmic, and often preceded by an unwanted premonitory urge. Immediately preceding tic onset, most individuals with Tourette's are aware of an urge, similar {{to the need to}} sneeze or scratch an itch. Individuals describe the need to tic as a buildup of tension, pressure, or energy which they consciously choose to release, as if they [...] "had to do it" [...] to relieve the sensation or until it feels [...] "just right". Examples of the premonitory urge are the feeling of <b>having</b> <b>something</b> in one's throat, or a localized discomfort in the shoulders, leading to the need to clear one's throat or shrug the shoulders. The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation, similar to scratching an itch. Another example is blinking to relieve an uncomfortable sensation in the eye. These urges and sensations, preceding the expression of the movement or vocalization as a tic, are referred to as [...] "premonitory sensory phenomena" [...] or premonitory urges. Because of the urges that precede them, tics are described as semi-voluntary or [...] "unvoluntary", rather than specifically involuntary; they may be experienced as a voluntary, suppressible response to the unwanted premonitory urge. Published descriptions of the tics of Tourette's identify sensory phenomena as the core symptom of the syndrome, even though they are not included in the diagnostic criteria.|$|E
500|$|In the anime, {{the most}} notable Charizard is one Ash Ketchum has had {{since he was a}} Charmander {{abandoned}} by his former owner Damian. Ash's Charmander evolved into Charmeleon during a battle against an army of Exeggutor, and his personality changed completely, becoming a disobedient Pokémon and fighting when and how he pleased. Charmeleon evolved when Ash summoned him for protection from wild prehistoric Pokémon; when an Aerodactyl attacked him and carried Ash off, Charmeleon evolved to fight the Aerodactyl and rescue Ash. Charizard still did not obey Ash, preferring to sleep, and only battled Pokémon that would pose a challenge, but Charizard helped Ash reach his goals, particularly against Gym Leader Blaine. Charizard's disobedience to Ash cost him the Kanto League. Charizard became loyal during the [...] after Ash battled a trainer with a Poliwrath and Charizard was frozen solid. Because of Ash's continuous self-sacrificing efforts to save Charizard from certain death, he began to obey Ash and defeated the Poliwrath in a rematch. He remained on Ash's team and contributed to his wins in the Orange League and parts of Johto. He eventually stayed behind in the Charizific Valley, a reserve where wild Charizard battle and train to become stronger. This was likely due to meeting Charla, a female Charizard for whom he developed a fondness. Charizard, like many of Ash's other Pokémon, returns on a temporary basis to battle at Ash's side, typically when Ash faces a particularly powerful Pokémon. Charizard has saved Ash's life on more than one occasion, as seen in the film , where he battled against Entei after arriving {{in the nick of time}} to prevent Ash and Pikachu from falling to their deaths, having flown over from the Charizific Valley after originally seeing a live broadcast from Ash running after Entei who had kidnapped Ash's mother, Delia Ketchum. Charizard returned during the Johto Pokémon League and defeated Gary's Blastoise, who had a type advantage over Charizard. Charizard also returned for Ash's first Battle Frontier battle, where he took on Articuno at the Battle Factory and won thanks to an unorthodox strategy. During the [...] Charizard officially rejoined Ash's team while Ash was exploring the Unova (Isshu) region. Upon meeting Ash again, he gave his trainer a Flamethrower to the face much to everyone's surprise. Charizard also developed a fierce rivalry with Iris's Dragonite so much so that both Ash and Iris agreed to have a battle. During the battle which originally began on the ground but later ascended skywards when both Pokémon took to the skies, it was shown that Charizard had learnt Wing Attack, Slash, and Dragon Tail but despite the two Pokémon <b>having</b> <b>something</b> of a very fierce rivalry with one another, N immediately called the battle off after realizing that Dragonite had injured its right arm. Charizard stayed with all of Ash's Pokémon sans Pikachu at Professor Oak's laboratory when Ash leaves Kanto once more for the faraway Kalos region. Charizard is Ash's strongest Pokémon.|$|E
