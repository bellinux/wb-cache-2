2500|$|The Oak Creek Irrigation Canal {{was built}} in 1935 by CCC labor to irrigate {{vegetation}} in the park's South Campground. Additional improvements were undertaken in [...] 1941 to replace wood flumes and to build new concrete diversion dams. The [...] canal diverts water from the North Fork of the Virgin River with a diversion dam that spans the river. A <b>headgate</b> {{on the west bank}} controls the flow. Further works executed in 1959 and 1961 provide irrigation to the visitor center and the Pine Creek residential area before laterals take off to irrigate the South Campground. [...] The ditch then rejoins the river. The canal is largely lined with concrete. A siphon connected to the south entrance plaza. The Oak Creek Canal was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 7, 1987, reference number 86003738.|$|E

50|$|The Bighorn Ditch <b>Headgate,</b> {{also known}} as the Bighorn Canal <b>Headgate,</b> was built {{starting}} in 1892 to provide irrigation to the Crow Indian Reservation in south central Montana. The <b>headgate</b> structure diverted water from the Bighorn River to their lands. It was designed by William F. Graves, and construction was carried out by Crow workers. The project was completed in 1904. Today the site is included in Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area.|$|E

50|$|Communities in the {{generally}} fertile but relatively dry valleys of the Great Basin, Southeastern Idaho, Nevada and Arizona were dependent on water supplies. Irrigation systems, including wells, dams, canals, <b>headgates,</b> and ditches, {{were among the}} first projects for a new community. Road access to timber in the mountains and pasturage for stock were important, as were carefully tended crops, gardens and orchards.|$|R
5000|$|In 1904 heavy silting {{greatly reduced}} the water-carrying {{capacity}} of the canal. Imperial Valley farmers, under considerable financial stress, pressured the California Development Company to resolve the problem.

5000|$|The rate {{of water}} loss through aquifer {{replenishment}} and evaporation in the Salton Sink was {{much less than the}} massive inflow of the Colorado River via the third diversion of the Alamo Canal (the [...] "Lower Mexican Intake"). As {{a direct result of the}} decision to create canal intakes from the Colorado River without <b>headgates</b> the Salton Sea was formed. [...] Ongoing provision of water to the Imperial Valley from the Alamo Canal ensured that the Salton Sea would remain intact through the lifetime of the canal.|$|R

50|$|The canal {{intake and}} {{temporary}} wooden <b>headgates</b> (known as the Chaffey Gate) were initially {{located in the}} United States at Pilot Knob due to {{the availability of a}} solid rock foundation. The canal then crossed the border with Mexico and ran parallel to the Colorado River for approximately 4 mi, where a channel was cut several miles west {{to the head of the}} Alamo River. This path was selected to avoid the expensive engineering that would otherwise be required if the canal were to traverse the Algodones Dunes.|$|R
50|$|The Edison Sault Power Canal is used {{to power}} the Saint Marys Falls Hydropower Plant at its eastern end. The canal {{separated}} downtown Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, from its mainland, making it an island. It was begun in September 1898 as the Michigan Lake Superior Power Company Canal, but completed by Edison Sault Electric Company in June 1902. Measured from its <b>headgates</b> to its end at the power plant, it is 2.25 mi in length, between 200 ft and 220 ft wide, and 24 ft deep. The water runs down the canal at speeds upwards of 7 mph.|$|R
50|$|Within two years, the Imperial Canal became {{filled with}} silt from the Colorado River. Engineers tried to {{alleviate}} the blockages to no avail. In 1905, heavy rainfall and snowmelt caused the Colorado River to swell, overrunning a set of <b>headgates</b> for the Alamo Canal. The resulting flood poured down the canal, breached an Imperial Valley dike, and ran down two former dry arroyos: the New River in the west, and the Alamo River in the east, each about 60 mi long. Over about two years, these two newly created rivers sporadically carried the entire volume of the Colorado River into the Salton Sink.|$|R
