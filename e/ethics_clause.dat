50|$|In February 2008, Greene filed a {{complaint}} with the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) against CKYE-FM and the Harjinder Thind Radio Show that aired on January 31, 2008. The complaint cited bias against the LGBT community. Greene also stated that the radio show allowed callers to make inaccurate statements against the LGBT Community and did not allow or invite any discussion for an opposing view. After a formal investigation, on October 23, 2008, the CBSC issued their decision and sided with Greene and found CKYE-FM and the Harjinder Thind Show in violation of the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Code of <b>Ethics,</b> <b>Clause</b> 7. CKYE-FM and the Harjinder Thind Show were required to air the decision and correction both in Punjabi and English.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{incident}} that occurred on The Source (separate from the Chiquita incident mentioned above) involved the July 4, 2011 broadcast, when Ezra Levant and journalist/blogger Kathryn Marshall discussed a municipal- and provincial-government-funded program in Edmonton that provides housing and studio space for Edmonton artists; during the discussion, Levant frequently (and Marshall occasionally) called the program [...] "free housing" [...] for artists. On the July 6 Source, Levant retracted the [...] "free housing" [...] comments after reading a viewer comment that faulted {{him for not}} verifying his claims (residents of the project do pay rent), though he stood by his objections to government funding for the project. The CBSC, after receiving 40 complaints on the incident, sided with Levant and Sun News in determining that no violation of Code of <b>Ethics</b> <b>Clauses</b> 6 and 7 (the latter clause concerns fair treatment on controversial issues) had occurred.|$|R
5000|$|The CBSC panel later {{ruled that}} CKIX-FM's {{handling}} of the [...] "Missing 9" [...] contest - specifically placing the object such {{that it was not}} reasonably accessible to the public at the outset, and later moving the object in contradiction of the broadcast clues - violated Clause 12 of the Canadian Association of Broadcastersâ€™ Code of <b>Ethics.</b> That <b>clause</b> states that [...] "all on-air contests and promotions shall be conceived and conducted fairly and legitimately and particular care shall be taken to ensure that they are not misleading". As is standard practice for CBSC violations, the station was required to announce the decision twice during peak listening hours.|$|R
2500|$|Chandler was {{the host}} of a Calgary radio show called Freedom Radio Network (the [...] "FRN" [...] on CHRB-AM Calgary). In August 2006 a {{complaint}} was received by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council about Chandler's radio program, alleging, among other things, that the program made repeated abusive comments likely to expose persons or groups to hatred and contempt on the basis of sexual orientation, that it broadcast false and misleading news, and that the program was used to retaliate and threaten retaliation for making a human rights complaint. In January 2007, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council reached a decision in the complaint. The Panel concluded that a broadcast on July 29, 2006 was in violation of Clause 6 ("Full, Fair and Proper Presentation") and Clause 7 ("Controversial Public Issues") of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Code of <b>Ethics,</b> but not <b>Clause</b> 2 ("Human Rights"). The Panel's decision, which CHRB-AM was required to announce on-air and in writing, was as follows: ...|$|R
