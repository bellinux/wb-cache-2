5|$|Intergem {{rocked the}} <b>gem</b> trade by {{marketing}} the Yogo as the world's only guaranteed untreated sapphire. By 1982, {{the practice of}} routinely heat treating gems had become {{a major issue in}} the industry. At the time, 95percent of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Thai traders had even purchased large quantities of naturally colorless Sri Lankan sapphires, known as geuda, and heated them to an artificial blue. A problem with the practice was that heated gems often fade over time, though trained gemologists can detect a heated <b>gem</b> with 95percent accuracy. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the <b>gem</b> industry. In 1985 there was a movement in Pennsylvania to require disclosure that a <b>gem</b> had been treated. Intergem's strategy resulted in large numbers of <b>gem</b> professionals visiting Yogo Gulch.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gems</b> TV 2 {{launched}} on 12 May 2005, after replacing <b>Gems</b> TV's former sister channel, Snatch It!. During the closing down of Snatch It!, {{it was announced}} that the new channel was going to be called <b>Gems</b> TV Silver, after a successful trial of Sterling Silver jewellery a few months previous. However, it wasn't until launch that it was decided that <b>Gems</b> TV would become known as <b>Gems</b> TV Gold and the new channel to be simply known as <b>Gems</b> TV. After a few months into the new venture, it became apparent that the venture wasn't as successful as <b>Gems</b> TV Gold. It was then decided <b>Gems</b> TV Gold reverted to <b>Gems</b> TV and the second channel becoming known as <b>Gems</b> TV 2 and that both channels would show a mixture of Gold and Sterling Silver jewellery. Since launch, the channel has used the same reverse auction format as <b>Gems</b> TV 1 and broadcast live between 8am and 2am. In late 2008/early 2009, the channel reduced its live hours to 3pm to 11pm. During its downtime, it simulcasted <b>Gems</b> TV 3. It was not until 2009 that <b>Gems</b> TV was officially referred to as <b>Gems</b> TV 1 and its hours were extended to 7am to 2am, despite the reduction of the live broadcasting hours on <b>Gems</b> TV 2.|$|R

5|$|In the {{campaign}} mode, {{the objective of}} each level is the acquisition of the Portal <b>Gem,</b> usually {{in the possession of}} the heroic guardian of the realm, although it is sometimes in the possession of a rival keeper. Whoever has the Portal <b>Gem</b> must be defeated, so Horny can enter and claim it. The final level involves defeating King Reginald, overlord of the entire realm of Harmonia. Some levels have more specific conditions relating to this goal: for example, there is one level in which the player races against the clock to obtain the Portal <b>Gem</b> in the possession of a rival keeper before the heroes invade and try to do the same. If the heroes recover the Portal <b>Gem,</b> the player loses. Other game modes include My Pet Dungeon and Skirmish. In My Pet Dungeon, the player constructs a dungeon without campaign-style objectives, and can control if, when, and how heroes invade. Instead, there are criteria based on the dungeon composition and related activities, and there is no requirement to proceed to the next level on completion. Skirmish involves competing against computer-controlled rival keepers, and the player can customize conditions such as which rooms and spells are available. Multiplayer is supported over IPX and TCP/IP and is otherwise similar to Skirmish. A patch added elite creatures (stronger than their normal counterparts) to the latter three modes. Elite creatures are attracted by constructing rooms with very specific tile arrangements.|$|E

5|$|Diamond {{enhancements}} {{are specific}} treatments performed on natural or synthetic diamonds (usually those already cut and polished into a <b>gem),</b> which {{are designed to}} better the gemological characteristics of the stone {{in one or more}} ways.
