40|$|This thesis uses {{data sets}} {{at a range}} of spatial and {{temporal}} scales to examine the <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> of the Lower Mississippi River to engineering and management. During the twentieth century the geomorphology of the Lower Mississippi River has been transformed {{by a series of}} engineering modifications to improve flood control and aid navigation. These have included steepening of the longitudinal profile by removal of the most sinuous bends, fixing the river to a constant planform through extensive bank stabilisation, and regulating sediment movement through the channel system by dike field construction. Prior to these modifications, the Lower Mississippi River adjusted its planform morphology to satisfy large-scale flow resistance requirements. However, this mode of adjustment has been effectively removed and adjustments are now restricted to the long profile and cross-sectional form. Morphological analysis reveals that the river has responded to engineering intervention at two principal scales: by vertical changes in the elevation of the channel bed at the reach-scale; and by increasing large-scale bedform resistance at the sub-reach scale through longitudinal and cross-sectional adjustments. These mutual changes are consistent with the changes in water surface elevation in the post-modification period noted by Biedenharn and Watson (1997). However, analysis of morphological and process dynamics at shorter timescales shows that <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> remains difficult to explain. This is because geomorphological behaviour at any scale, and in any location within an alluvial channel, is a product of complex spatially-distributed feedbacks between operating processes and multiple scales of channel morphology. This has general significance in terms of research design because detecting the complexity at each scale of adjustment, and forming linkages between scales of adjustment, is dependent on taking into account all possible degrees of freedom, and applying a range of complementary analytical techniques.

40|$|Runoff {{production}} and soil erosion, produced by energetic Mediterranean storms, are amongst the first {{environmental impacts of}} opencast mining activity and amongst the main limiting factors in achieving self-sustaining reclaimed landscapes in Teruel. This paper aims to understand the <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> of topsoiled and overburden-covered banks. This is considered essential in improving soil management and designing accurate erosion control plans. Runoff and erosion rates were recorded after every rainfall in permanent plots for one year in both overburden and topsoiled banks. In the same way experiments were conducted with a portable rainfall simulator to follow the response evolution throughout time. Grass communties control topsoiled bank evolution, leading to an improvement in the hydric characteristics of the topsoil during ecological succession. Physical-chemical soil properties condition the erosion processes in overburden-covered banks. No improvement in infiltration rate nor in erodibility has been recorded 6 years after the slope banks were constructed. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Sediment {{monitoring}} and assessment remain {{one of the most}} challenging tasks in fluvial geomorphology and water quality studies. As a response to various environmental and human disturbance effects, the main sources and pathways of the sediments transported within catchments, especially most pristine small one, may change. The paper discusses state-of-the-art in the sediment budget research for small catchments. We identified nine independent approaches in the sediment transport assessment and applied them in 11 catchments across Eurasia in the framework of an FP – 7 Marie Curie – International Research Staff Exchange Scheme in 2012 - 2016. These methods were classified as: i) Field-based methods (In-situ monitoring of sediment transport;– Soil morphological methods and dating techniques; Sediment source fingerprinting; Sediment-water discharge relationships), ii) GIS and remote sensing approaches (Riverbed monitoring based on remote sensing/historical maps; parametrization of the channel sediment connectivity; Sediment transport remote sensing modeling), and iii) Numerical approaches (Soil erosion modeling and gully erosion (stochastic and empirical models); channel hydrodynamic modeling). We present the background theory and application examples of all selected methods. Linking fieldbased methods and datasets with numerical approaches, process measurements as well as monitoring can provide enhanced insights into sediment transfer and related water quality impacts. Adopting such integrated and multi-scale approaches in a sediment budget framework might contribute to improved understanding of hydrological and <b>geomorphological</b> <b>responses.</b>  </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{geomorphology}} of a {{river valley}} and characteristics {{of a river}} channel influence the frequency, duration, and intensity of flooding. Periodic flooding and bank inundation influences the size {{and structure of the}} stream channel and the characteristics of the riparian vegetation. Land use changes within many watersheds – including drainages of the Upper Platte Valley of southern Wyoming - have resulted in river systems that exhibit reduced dynamics, simplified gradients, and disconnected landscape components. A primary goal of ecological river restoration is to assist in the recovery of degraded stream systems by strengthening the hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological processes that sustain their integrity and resilience while working to achieve the desired future conditions defined for the landscape. The Wyoming Game 2 ̆ 6 Fish Department (WGFD), Trout Unlimited (TU) and the Saratoga-Encampment-Rawlins Conservation District (SERCD) have invested significant resources restoring, enhancing, and improving the Encampment River, its fishery, and the greater watershed. While restoration projects have been successful in meeting many important objectives, revegetation efforts along the constructed reaches has proven difficult due to the coarse cobble substrate native to the system. In addition, constructed banks retain very few fine sediments, as these tend to migrate when the substrate is moved and graded. In response to these challenges, a research project was initiated in 2013 which examines methods and materials to improve riparian revegetation along constructed reaches, and to evaluate both ecological and <b>geomorphological</b> <b>responses</b> to these revegetation efforts. This presentation will discuss this ongoing research effort, present preliminary results, and discuss the applicability of these findings to similar systems in the Intermountain West...|$|R
40|$|In {{northern}} Brittany {{an important}} <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> to Holocene sea-level rise {{has been the}} development of coastal dunes with associated lagoons and marshes. At Anse du Verger, a marsh has formed behind a dune system which has been developing in situ for the last 4000 year. The lithostratigraphy of the marsh comprises extensive peat formation, with sands, silts and occasional sand lenses, the latter probably associated with storm surges. The sequence dates from 10, 320 +/- 120 BP. After 3000 BP, flood episodes on the marsh are more common, while the upper marsh deposits can be correlated with the recent period of dune building. Prehistoric artifacts (remains of cooking implements) have been found on a cliff {{to the east of}} the marsh and are buried by washover deposits, which indicates a sudden abandonment of a settlement possibility due to a storm surge soon after 2460 +/- 80 BP. Surge levels are proposed as a controlling factor on dune crest elevation...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new computational model designed to simulate and investigate reach-scale alluvial dynamics within a landscape evolution model. The model {{is based on the}} cellular automaton concept, whereby the continued iteration of a series of local process ‘rules’ governs the behaviour of the entire system. The model is {{a modified version of the}} CAESAR landscape evolution model, which applies a suite of physically based rules to simulate the entrainment, transport and deposition of sediments. The CAESAR model has been altered to improve the representation of hydraulic and geomorphic processes in an alluvial environment. In-channel and overbank flow, sediment entrainment and deposition, suspended load and bed load transport, lateral erosion and bank failure have all been represented as local cellular automaton rules. Although these rules are relatively simple and straightforward, their combined and repeatedly iterated effect is such that complex, non-linear <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> can be simulated within the model. Examples of such larger-scale, emergent responses include channel incision and aggradation, terrace formation, channel migration and river meandering, formation of meander cutoffs, and transitions between braided and single-thread channel patterns. In the current study, the model is illustrated on a reach of the River Teifi, near Lampeter, Wales, UK...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change will}} have {{pervasive}} {{effects on the}} world’s coasts, but at broad scales these changes have typically proven difficult to analyse in a systematic manner. This paper explores an outcome-driven deductive methodology for geomorphological analysis that structures current knowledge and understanding using fuzzy logic concepts. Building on recent large-scale coastal investigations and with reference to {{a case study of}} the East Anglian coast U. K, the methodology defines the active coastal system using a flexible generic classification and integrates expert opinion, using the notion of possibility, as a basis for the assessment of potential future <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> to changes in sea level and sediment supply. The proposed methodology produces a robust qualitative structure for assessment and forecasting of coastal geomorphology. Preliminary results for the East Anglian coast suggest that shoreline management is already having, and will continue to be, a significant influence on coastal evolution irrespective of the rate of sea-level rise. Therefore, significant potential exists to guide future coastal evolution towards preferred outcomes by using such methods as a component of adaptive shoreline management. This methodology could be applied {{to a wide range of}} problems both in geomorphology and other subject...|$|E
40|$|Long-term channel {{changes of}} the Tagus and the Jarama Rivers in central Spain were studied in {{relation}} to variations in hydroclimatic factors, such as rainfall and flooding, and also with respect to human activities undertaken in their valleys. Data were taken from historical (1580 – 1823) and topographical (1877 – 1988) maps, as well as aerial photographs (1945 – 1999). The available hydroclimatic data consists {{of a series of}} monthly rainfall totals (1859 – 1994) and mean river flow values recorded at gauging stations (1911 – 1985). In addition, a historical flood record (1550 – 1947) was produced from documentary sources. Some of the data was incorporated into a geographical information system (GIS) to quantify the changes {{in the course of the}} rivers. The results show there have been two distinct periods: before and after human intervention in the river system, which took place around 1950. During the earlier period (1550 – 1950), a correlation exists between climate, frequency and magnitude of flooding and changes in fluvial geomorphology. Between 1860 and 1892 an increase in flood frequency and magnitude occurred, which produced half of the cut-offs recorded in the study area between 1823 and 1877. The meanders length (L), width (W) and radius of curvature (RC) of the Tagus River have decreased since 1750. However, those of the Jarama reached their maximum values during flood periods. Both rivers have different <b>geomorphological</b> <b>responses</b> during flood events, which can explain these different trends. Floods in the Jarama not only led to the cut-offs, but also enlarged the channel size (L, W and RC). In the second period (1956 —present), flow regulation via dams and gravel mining modified the system completely and impeded the natural development of these rivers. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Confined shallow-water environments are {{encountered}} {{many places}} {{along the coast}} of the inner Danish waters. Despite their common occurrence, these environments have rarely been studied as sedimentary archives. In this study we set out to trace back changes in relative sea-level and associated <b>geomorphological</b> <b>responses</b> in sediment cores retrieved from coastal lagoon systems on the island of Samsø, central Denmark. In the mid-Atlantic period, the post-glacial sea-level rise reached what is today the southern Kattegat Sea. Waves, currents and tides began to erode the unconsolidated moraine material and melt-out deposits. This initiated sedimentation in adjacent coastal lagoons and further supported the formation of coastal barriers. Until present day, the ongoing isostatic uplift caused a continuous drop of relative sea-level resulting in shoreline accretion and successive lagoonal infilling. Stratigraphy, grain-size distribution, fossil and organic matter content of cores retrieved from the lagoons were analyzed and compared. Age control was established using radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dating. Our data produced a surprisingly consistent pattern for the sedimentary successions found in the lagoons. The period of initial transgression can be identified as the onset of deposition of fine-grained, organic-rich sediments. However, radiocarbon dates evidence a punctuation of these deposits further upcore. Grain-size analysis suggests that the reworking and abrasion of the lagoon sediments resulted from the gradual lowering of the wave-base. The core sequence is topped-off by marine sands and wind-blown deposits. Based on these findings, we suggest a conceptual model that allows inferring age and elevation of transgressive and regressive stages from the lagoon cores. The common occurrence of similar environments distributed along gradients of isostatic uplift/subsidence (approximately + 0, 5 to - 0, 5 mm/yr) in the south-western Baltic, makes coastal lagoon systems a valuable archive for the reconstruction of Holocene sea-level and coastal evolution...|$|R
40|$|Changes in the {{frequency}} and magnitude of extreme meteorological events are associated with changing environmental means. Such events are important in human affairs, and can also be investigated by orbital remote sensing. During {{the course of this}} project, we applied ERS- 1, ERS- 2, Radarsat, and an airborne sensor (AIRSAR-TOPSAR) to measure flood extents, flood water surface profiles, and flood depths. We established a World Wide Web site (the Dartmouth Flood Observatory) for publishing remote sensing-based maps of contemporary floods worldwide; this is also an online "active archive" that presently constitutes the only global compilation of extreme flood events. We prepared an article for EOS concerning SAR imaging of the Mississippi Valley flood; an article for the International Journal of Remote Sensing on measurement of a river flood wave using ERS- 2, began work on an article (since completed and published) on the Flood Observatory for a Geoscience Information Society Proceedings volume, and presented lectures at several Geol. Soc. of America Natl. Meetings, an Assoc. of Amer. Geographers Natl. Meeting, and a Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium (all on SAR remote sensing of the Mississippi Valley flood). We expanded in-house modeling capabilities by installing the latest version of the Army Corps of Engineers RMA two-dimensional hydraulics software and BYU Engineering Graphics Lab's Surface Water Modeling System (finite elements based pre- and post-processors for RMA work) and also added watershed modeling software. We are presently comparing the results of the 2 -d flow models with SAR image data. The grant also supported several important upgrades of pc-based remote sensing infrastructure at Dartmouth. During work on this grant, we collaborated with several workers at the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Remote Sensing/GIS laboratory (for flood inundation mapping and modeling; particularly of the Illinois River using the AIRSAR/TOPSAR/ERS- 2 combined data), with Dr. Karen Prestegaard at the University of Maryland (<b>geomorphological</b> <b>responses</b> to the extreme 1993 flood along the Raccoon drainage in central Iowa), and with Mr Tim Scrom of the Albany National Weather Service River Forecast Center (initial planning for the use of Radarsat and ERS- 2 for flood warning).

40|$|Modern rivers undergo {{constant}} stress from disturbances such as bank stabilization, channelization, dams, and water expenditures. As these anthropogenic activities persist, efficient methods of characterizing rivers remain essential. Macroinvertebrates {{are an important}} feature in evaluating fluvial health, because they are often the first to react to contaminants. These toxins can be transferred through macroinvertebrates to other trophic levels. The purpose {{of this research was}} to use a geospatial model to differentiate instream macroinvertebrate habitats, and determine if the model is a viable method for stream evaluation. Through the use of ArcGIS and digital elevation models, the geomorphology of the Qu’Appelle River, Saskatchewan was assessed. Four geomorphological characteristics of the river were isolated (sinuosity, slope, fractal dimension, stream width) and clustered through a Principle Component Analysis, yielding sets of river reaches with similar geomorphological characteristics, called typologies. These typologies were mapped to form a geospatial model of the river, and grouped into <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> units (GRUs). Macroinvertebrate data were aligned to the model, revealing relationships between macroinvertebrate taxa and fluvial geomorphology. A Kruskal-Wallis analysis and post hoc pairwise multiple comparisons pinpointed significant relationships between several genera and typologies. Furthermore, certain GRUs contained more sensitive macroinvertebrate families and healthier levels of diversity than other GRUs. Typologies were better suited to relate geomorphology to macroinvertebrate taxa, because they represented a more direct relationship to localised geomorphological characteristics than GRUs...|$|E
40|$|Many rivers are {{intensely}} managed due to anthropogenic influences such as dams, channelization, {{and water}} provision for municipalities, agriculture, and industry. With this growing pressure on fluvial systems comes a greater need {{to evaluate the}} state of their ecosystems. The purpose {{of this research is}} to use a geospatial model of the Qu’Appelle River in Saskatchewan to distinguish instream macroinvertebrate habitats at the family level. River geomorphology was assessed through the use of ArcGIS and digital elevation models; with these tools, the sinuosity, slope, fractal dimension, and stream width of the river were processed. Subsequently, Principal Component Analysis, a clustering technique, revealed areas with similar sets of geomorphological characteristics. These similar typology sequences were then grouped into <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> units (GRUs), designated a color, and mapped into a geospatial model. Macroinvertebrate data was then incorporated to reveal several relationships to the model. For instance, certain GRUs contained more highly sensitive species and healthier diversity levels than others. Future possibilities for expanding on this project include incorporating stable isotope data to evaluate the food-web structure within the river basin. Although GRUs have been very successful in identifying fish habitats in other studies, the macroinvertebrates may be too sessile and their habitat too localized to be identified by such large river units. Units may need to be much shorter (250 m) to better identify macroinvertebrate habitat...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of river channel dynamics, and their <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> to environmental change, has frequently focused on channel planform adjustments, often reconstructed using historical maps and aerial photographs. These can provide annual- to centennial-scale records of lateral channel instability at reach, catchment and regional scales. However, regional analyses of vertical channel instability dynamics (incision and aggradation), although highly desirable, {{have been far}} less common and have traditionally been confined to reach scale studies. This study analysed 638 river channel cross sections and associated longitudinal profiles, surveyed on 25 Welsh rivers over {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century by various agencies. Net channel bed scour has been the dominant process in 96 % of the rivers studied, with only 4 % of rivers showing no average scour in any period. The maximum recorded scour and fill at individual cross sections were 2. 54 m and 2. 52 m, respectively whilst average annual rates were in the order of 0. 01 m yr- 1 and 0. 02 m yr- 1, respectively. Catchment area and river bed gradient are the most important controls on the average rate of scour and fill on Welsh rivers, but flow regulation and channelisation are also locally important. The results from this study have important implications for river and flood risk management, because they demonstrate the sensitivity of bed elevation (and consequently channel capacity) to short-term environmental change.

40|$|Glacier {{outburst}} floods are sudden {{releases of}} {{large amounts of}} water from a glacier. They are a pervasive natural hazard worldwide. They have an association with climate primarily via glacier mass balance and their impacts on society partly depend on population pressure and land use. Given the ongoing changes in climate and land use and population distributions there is therefore an urgent need to discriminate the spatio-temporal patterning of glacier outburst floods and their impacts. This study presents data compiled from 20 countries and comprising 1348 glacier floods spanning 10 centuries. Societal impacts were assessed using a relative damage index based on recorded deaths, evacuations, and property and infrastructure destruction and disruption. These floods originated from 332 sites; 70 % were from ice-dammed lakes and 36 % had recorded societal impact. The number of floods recorded has apparently reduced since the mid- 1990 s in all major world regions. Two thirds of sites that have produced >  5 floods (n =  32) have floods occurring progressively earlier in the year. Glacier floods have directly caused at least: 7 deaths in Iceland, 393 deaths in the European Alps, 5745 deaths in South America and 6300 deaths in central Asia. Peru, Nepal and India have experienced fewer floods yet higher levels of damage. One in five sites in the European Alps has produced floods that have damaged farmland, destroyed homes and damaged bridges; 10 % of sites in South America have produced glacier floods that have killed people and damaged infrastructure; 15 % of sites in central Asia have produced floods that have inundated farmland, destroyed homes, damaged roads and damaged infrastructure. Overall, Bhutan and Nepal have the greatest national-level economic consequences of glacier flood impacts. We recommend that accurate, full and standardised monitoring, recording and reporting of glacier floods is essential if spatio-temporal patterns in glacier flood occurrence, magnitude and societal impact are to be better understood. We note that future modelling of the global impact of glacier floods cannot assume that the same trends will continue and will need to consider combining land-use change with probability distributions of <b>geomorphological</b> <b>responses</b> to climate change and to human activity...|$|R

Short-term sedimentation {{processes in}}clude various events that accompany earthquakes and volcanic activities.

Sedimentary processes associated with earthquakes are crucial to the understanding of sedimentation systems in a subduction zone. Moreover, paleoseismic histories that can be deduced from sedimentary records and the assessment of tsunami hazards associated with submarine slope failures provide important information for disaster mitigation (e.g., Goldfinger 2011; Yamada et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Morphotectonic is <b>geomorphological</b> {{characteristic}} as <b>response</b> of tectonic. Watershed morphometric {{may reflect}} tectonic conditions of a region. Parameters of morphometric and morphotectonic {{can be an}} indicator of the activity of a fault. Active fault is a tectonic trace that can be a source of seismicity in the area of land. The southern part of West Java is dominated by Quaternary volcanic products. These materials are generally unstable, especially when affected by fault. Some areas {{in the southern part of}} West Java regionally controlled by Quaternary faulting. The movement of this fault can be triggered by the subduction activity in the south of Java Island. This study aims to determine the role morphotectonic characteristics as indicators of the presence of active faults in the region of the Southern part of Cianjur and Garut. The result is expected to be useful to help the community and the government in anticipation of a crisis when geological disasters occur as an impact of the active faults. Systematic research based on the mindset that past geological events, along with its development can produce a typical landforms. Lineament of the landslide zone is assumed to be associated with active fault lines that can be reflected by the specific characteristics of morphotectonic and lithology.

40|$|Salt-marshes {{are highly}} {{valuable}} ecosystems {{due to their}} role in supporting the aquatic and bird life. Furthermore, many anthropogenic activities such as agriculture, salt production or aquaculture targets these areas. They also act as protective barriers to shores, given their ability to dissipate most of the wave and current energy in high tide. Sea level rise can place these intertidal zones at risk, reinforcing the need to understand their morphosedimentary and dynamic response to the variations on the forcing factors, thus allowing for a better management of these environments. Large expansions of salt-marshes and tidal flats are among the morphodynamic contents of the Tagus estuary. This study focuses on the recent past evolution of Tagus marsh areas {{in order to understand}} their <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> to higher sea level scenarios. Cores were taken in four contrasting high salt-marsh expansions in estuarine margins (Trancão – TR, Mouchão da Póvoa – MP, Pancas – PA and Corroios - CO). Marsh surfaces were surveyed using DGPS-RTK and tidal regime characterized at each location. The cores reached at least 1. 20 m in depth and were subsampled every cm for 210 Pb and 137 Cs radioisotope determination, allowing the derivation of sedimentation rates. In all locations, accretion rates clearly exceed the post- 1920 mean rate of sea level rise (+ 0. 21 cm/year, Cascais gauge). Their linear extrapolation into the future, until reaching the upper threshold of marsh surface aggradation (MSHT), suggests that Tagus marginal marshes will not drown under the projected sea level elevation scenarios {{for the end of the}} 21 th century...|$|E
40|$|A basin-scale, {{integrated}} approach, including sedimentological, geomorphological {{and soil}} data, enables the reliable {{reconstruction of the}} infilling history of the southern Apenninic foredeep, with its subsequent inclusion in the wedge-top of the foreland basin system. An example is shown from the Molise-Apulian Apennines (Southern Italy), between Trigno and Fortore rivers, where the Pleistocene tectono-sedimentary evolution of the basin is framed into a sequence-stratigraphic scheme. Specifically, within the traditional subdivision into Quaternary marine (Qm) and Quaternary continental (Qc) depositional cycles, five third-order depositional sequences (Qm 1, Qm 2, Qc 1, Qc 2 and Qc 3) are identified based on recognition of four major stratigraphic discontinuities. The lower sequence boundaries are represented by angular unconformities or abrupt facies shifts and are generally associated with distinctive pedological and geomorphological features. Three paleosols, observed at top of depositional sequences Qm 2, Qc 1 and Qc 2, represent pedostratigraphic markers that can be tracked basinwide. The <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> to major tectonosedimentary events {{is marked by a}} series of paleosurfaces with erosional, depositional and complex characteristics. Detailed investigation of the relationships between stratigraphic architecture and development of unconformities, paleosols and paleosurfaces suggests that the four sequence boundaries were formed in response to four geomorphological phases/tectonic events which affected the basin during the Quaternary. The first three tectonic events (Lower-Middle Pleistocene), marking the lower boundaries of sequences Qm 2, Qc 1 and Qc 2, respectively, are interpreted {{to be related to the}} tectonic regime that characterized the last phase of thrusting recorded in the Southern Apennines.

40|$|Se estudió la geomorfología submarina y se efectuaron mediciones de corrientes de marea en el canal San Blas para determinar la dinámica sedimentaria actual. Se relevó un sector del fondo del canal con el sistema batimétrico GeoSwath para describir exhaustivamente la morfología de un campo de dunas. Su asimetría permite inferir un transporte {{residual}} del material del fondo hacia el interior de la Bahía Anegada sobre el veril NE del canal. Se realizó un estudio de la dinámica de las corrientes de marea, determinándose sus velocidades y direcciones durante un ciclo completo de marea en toda la columna de agua y a {{lo largo de}} un perfil transversal a la costa mediante un ADCP. A pesar que el ambiente corresponde a un régimen micromareal (rango de marea alrededor de 2 m), en el canal San Blas existen fuertes corrientes de marea que desde el sector medio transportan todo el material inconsolidado del fondo, formando un delta de reflujo en la boca externa del canal y un delta de flujo en la Bahía Anegada. Se reconocieron diferentes geoformas costeras que permiten inferir un transporte litoral hacia el exterior del canal sobre la costa sur del mismo. Basándose en sus características morfodinámicas, es posible definir el canal San Blas como una entrada de marea que conecta el mar abierto con la Bahía Anegada. The Bahía Anegada is {{the coastal}} zone of {{the southern part of}} Buenos Aires Province (Argentina), where several environments are recognized: islands, inlets, marshes, tidal plains and different types of beaches. The Bahía San Blas is located at {{the southern part of the}} Bahía Anegada, where the San Blas channel separates the mainland from an island (Fig. 1). The San Blas channel is 2. 5 km wide and 12 km long. The study area has a tidal amplitude characterized by a mean of 1. 62 m, being 2. 20 and 0. 58 m the high and low tide respectively. The present study shows the results of a bathymetric survey of the San Blas channel and an analysis of the behavior of the tidal currents that affect sediment transport and promote the generation of different bedforms. The aim of this study was to analyze the submarine geomorphology related to the dynamic conditions in order to characterize in detail the sedimentary conditions in this area. A detailed bathymetric study was conducted over a zone of 50 km², covering the San Blas channel, through a digital echosounder Bathy- 500 positioned by DGPS operating in real time. Fifteen transversal tracks and three longitudinal tracks were made at the San Blas channel in order to obtain the necessary bathymetric profiles to make a bathymetric chart of the area. Over a zone of 1. 5 km², characterized by a field of subaqueous dunes, a Phase Measuring Bathymetric System (FMBS), called swath bathymetry system "GeoSwath Plus" from GeoAcoustics Lt. (UK), was employed in order to determine the detailed dune morphology. This survey yielded details and disposition of the bedforms present on the channel bed with centimetric precision. Bottom sediment samples were collected and tidal currents were measured using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) mounted on a ship. The tidal currents were measured during a whole tidal cycle, obtaining the distribution of velocity and direction over the water column, on a track carried out transversally to the channel. These values were computed with the associated WinRiver software. The entire field work (bathymetry, sampling, FMBS and ADCP) was performed with the 6. 5 m long boat IADO IV. The coastal features display <b>geomorphological</b> differences in <b>response</b> to a changing dynamic regimen along the channel (Fig. 2). Remarkable morphological and textural differences occur along the coast. Close to the mouth, a dissipative beach, with medium sand and a gentle slope is present. Mobile coastal dunes are common crowning the beach. Nearly the central part, the beach is steeper and composed of gravels developing then a reflective beach. Towards the north, in the inner part of the Bahía Anegada (north of Punta Ramirez), wave-cut platforms and marshes covered with Spartina alterniflora appear, sheltered by cliffs formed by deposits from the Río Negro Formation. The bathymetric map allows distinguishing the existence of significant changes in the morphology throughout the San Blas channel. Based on these differences, the area was divided into 4 zones (Fig. 3), each one with distinctive profiles (Fig. 4). Zones I and II are characterized by a 28 m-depth flat bottom, free of unconsolidated sediments and with steep flanks. These features allow establishing an analogy with a tidal throat. A subaqueous dune field, covering an area of more than 1. 5 km², was found in Zone III. Zone IV is a shallow area where sand bars are exposed during low tide. The dune field was characterized by large dunes, with spacing between 40 - 80 m and heights of 2. 5 m, identified at 21 m depth (Fig. 5). Higher dunes occur in deeper zones, reaching values of 4. 5 - 5 m height at around 24 m depths. Most of the subaqueous dunes located on the southern portion of the dune field exhibit a symmetrical cross section and are covered by smaller bedforms of 0. 3 - 1 m high and 0. 7 to 0. 9 m of spacing. On the other hand, dunes located on the northern side of the field are asymmetrical, with the steeper side towards the inner part of the channel. The mean grain size in the field dune is between medium and coarse sand (1. 8 a 0. 28 phi) that is in equilibrium with the strong velocities of tidal currents. The results obtained from the current measurements over a tidal cycle show that maximum velocities measured in the San Blas channel reached 2 m s- 1 during flood and 1. 8 m s- 1 during ebb (Fig. 6). The maximum velocities of the flood currents were attained mainly on the northern flank and central part of the channel almost reaching the bottom. On the other hand, the maximum velocities of the ebb currents were found on the deepest site of the profile, on the southern flank, from mid-water up to the surface. At both ends of the channel, sand accumulates due to the reduction in the carrying capacity which leads to the formation of an ebb and a flood tidal deltas. The sand bars exposed in low tide in the inward shallow part in the Anegada Bay is the tidal flood delta formed by the loss in the sediment transport capacity caused by the widening of the channel section. This unconsolidated granular sediment is available to be transported by the tidal currents. Towards the outer part of the channel, the bathymetric map shows shallower depths while nautical charts confirm the presence of submarine bars at the entrance of the San Blas channel (Fig. 7). These bars might be evidence of the occurrence of an ebb tidal delta. The present study allowed concluding that the San Blas channel is a narrow strait between the mainland and an island, connecting the Anegada Bay with the outer sea and showing different submarine topography. Towards the mouth, the channel presents a flat bottom over 80 % of its width, showing a U shape. The bottom is free of unconsolidated sediments due to the strong currents that wash away any loose material. The submarine topography of the San Blas channel corresponds very well with the tidal inlet significance...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> of valley bottoms {{in eastern}} France to climatic {{fluctuations}} of the Little Ice Age (LIA) was investigated using sedimentological analysis together with {{optically stimulated luminescence}} (OSL) and radiocarbon dating. Diachronic mapping of land use {{since the beginning of}} the nineteenth century was also carried out. Since A. D. 1500, the valley bottoms experienced three cycles of aggradation and subsequent incision, each characterized by paired periods of high and low detritic activity. While the impact of human activity on the aggradation of the alluvial plain is observed, the vertical dynamics of the valley bottom deposits seemingly were also linked to the hydroclimatic fluctuations during the LIA. The sensitivity to these fluctuations was increased by human activity at the scale of the basin. Variations of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and solar activity from the last five centuries correlate with wet and cold phases during which valley bottoms accumulated, and dry and warm phases during which the streams incised into the valley floors. This fluvial sensitivity to the meteorological conditions induced temporal variations in sedimentary supply originating from either direct input from remnants of periglacial alluvial sheets or local rocky outcrops and/or from indirect input from the erosion of alluvial and colluvial deposits. These two components, combined with the sheet runoff over the ploughlands, express the complex coupling between hillslopes and valley bottoms in the headwater catchments. This caused a cascade-shaped transit of the sediments characterized by alternating phases of storage and removal.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the geological, biological and oceanographical environment of coral banks in the Porcupine Seabight. The study area is characterised by well delimited geographic clusters of coral banks, each characterized by their typical bank morphology and environmental setting. In the central part two mound provinces are recognised: complex flat topped seafloor mounds in the 'Hovland mound province', and a large number of smaller N-S elongated buried mounds in the 'Magellan mound province'. Along the eastern margin of the basin partly buried and outcropping mounds form the 'Belgica mound province'. The banks are mound-shaped elevations, hosting living deepwater coral (Lophelia sp., Madrepora sp., Desmophyllum sp., Dendrophylla sp.) and associated fauna. This biological active layer covers a dead assemblage of corals clogged with mud. Endogenic and exogenic environmental parameters are evaluated in time and related to the <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> of the banks. All coral banks, buried or outcropping, occur in association with current-induced features (e. g., scouring features, dunes) and steep palaeo and present seabed slopes. Only a few banks are outcropping in the present setting which suggests that environmental conditions were more favourable for bank development in the past. The depth range of these outcropping mounds coincides with the top of the dense Mediterranean OutflowWater, where current enhancement may control the coral distribution not only nowadays but also in the initial phase of coral bank development. The distribution of corals in the southeastern North Atlantic and the actual link with Mediterranean water suggest a possible migration of corals within the Mediterranean water into the Atlantic. The startup phase of coral bank development in Porcupine Seabight was simultaneous for all provinces, after a Late Pliocene period of erosion and non-deposition. Sediment stress time variations, largely controlled by currents, {{play an important role in}} bank development. Coral banks accrete by active baffling of sediment by the biological framework and extension of the biological cap (catch-up phase). Once this fragile system between sedimentation and biological growth is out of balance, the framework will progressively be clogged with sediment (keep-up phase). Once sediment dominates the structure the coral banks get buried and draped by sediment (give-up phase) ...|$|E
40|$|The Northern Alpine Foreland Basin (NAFB) {{formed as}} a result of alpine {{continental}} collision in Oligocene time. Tectonic shortening has been slow since the Miocene, implying that the NAFB subsidence has come to rest. The scope of this thesis is to find evidence that yield information regarding the recent vertical tectonic activity and a potentially ongoing basin inversion. The identification of such an active inversion can be accomplished by studying the landscape evolution. This is possible, because the earth’s surface contains information about tectonic and erosional processes. In order to understand and quantify the underlying mechanisms forming the landscape, both surface and subsurface information can be linked. Especially when geophysical or similar data are insufficient, geomorphological analyses provide new insights. The NAFB is a low-strain sedimentary basin, where historic subsurface data confirm subsidence, while the present-day erosional relief indicates uplift. The basin has a long prospection history and geometries of basement faults are well known, but their link to topography is ambiguous and the landscape is regarded as climatically controlled. In this context, dense population and energy exploration call for a fundamental understanding, if the basin is uplifting and whether or not faults could potentially be reactivated. This thesis aims at characterizing geomorphotectonic indicators of uplift, potentially indicating NAFB inversion. Related to this process, vertical motion of a few hundred meters to a few kilometers is expected to have been taking place during the Plio- Pleistocene. My study addresses the Quaternary geomorphology and distribution of sediments across the NAFB. To assess a potential link between asymmetric valleys and underlying basement faults in the NE portion of the basin (Tertiary Hills region), I analyzed high-resolution space-borne imagery and carried out geologic fieldwork. Results in distinct <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> of the NAFB are (a) regional scale erosion of sediments, (b) fluvial incision, (c) reactivation of documented faults and (d) regional scale tilting of paleo-geodetic markers. 1 In the NE portion of the NAFB, the geometry of a detected high-angle geologic subsurface contact associated with a surface escarpment, potentially originated from young surface faulting, while landscape morphology is intensely overprinted by climatic processes and anthropogenic land use. The investigation of mid-Miocene coastal features of the Swabian Alb cliff line addresses the landscape evolution along the marginal area of the NAFB. The particular questions here are, if coastal outcrops are part of the same coast, and which mechanisms have caused their different present-day elevations. I investigated marine features in a geologic field survey and compiled stratigraphic data to infer the regional response to uplift. The results show that two sites represent temporally and spatially different coastal sections, and both have been intensely modified by multiple erosional processes. The data can be explained by invoking a combination of surface erosion and possible lithospheric scale uplift. My study of well data and geomorphic markers, to infer NAFB Quaternary sediment budgets, yields a remarkable erosion of sediments along the central E-W basin axis and fluvial networks in disequilibrium. I examined erosion rates across different timescales, using sediment yields from NAFB catchments and basin sediment flux. On the Pleistocene timescale, geomorphic indicators of fluvial systems are investigated while for the Holocene, archeological data provide constraints on local erosion. The results of this study reveal a distinct oval-shaped erosion pattern across the NAFB, which can explain the modern erosional relief of the region, and further implies active inversion of the basin. Similar results are derived from drainage pattern and river steepness estimates. The results of this thesis imply that the Quaternary landscape in the NAFB has been significantly influenced by tectonic activity. Further, the timing for the NAFB transition from subsidence to uplift is likely to originate at the Pliocene – Quaternary boundary, and continues. Therefore, the possibility of future fault reactivation, controlled by lithospheric scale uplift, cannot be ruled out...|$|E
40|$|The geomorphological {{effectiveness}} of flood events may highly {{vary depending on}} several factors, including discharge, duration, frequency, ordering, environmental conditions, human interference, etc. Precise rates and patterns of change produced by flooding remain largely unknown and unpredictable and multiple sources of error undermine the achievement of accurate estimates of geomorphic variations. Focusing on channel processes, the complex control exerted by riparian vegetation at multiple scales and, in particular, on riverbank dynamics further registers {{a lack of understanding}} that may lead to possible misleading approaches to manage fluvial erosion issues. This study primarily seeks to analyse and interpret the <b>geomorphological</b> <b>response</b> of two differently-impacted gravel-bed rivers (Piave and Tagliamento rivers, Italy) to flood events slightly below bankfull discharge. Furthermore, a focus on bank erosion processes on an Australian stream characterized by extensive tree abutments and cohesive scalloped riverbanks (the King River, Victoria) will try to explain the control exerted by riparian vegetation on the evolution of bank retreat. New findings and relationships will help to create a more comprehensive conceptual model describing bank migration past forested riverbanks that will be further tested on the Piave River, offering the possibility of comparing fluvial systems with very different environmental conditions (primarily, cohesive versus non-cohesive sediment). For the detection of geomorphic variations, enhanced DoD models including a precise evaluation of flowing channels, are derived by differencing pre- and post-flood integrated DEMs (LiDAR, dGPS and colour bathymetry). The reliable estimates of change have contributed to effectively quantify planimetric and volumetric adjustments of main channels and major bank removal. On the other hand, bank migration processes were examined on the King River by surveying the characteristics of trees and bank profile spaces to uncover significant relationships explaining the retreat of vegetated riverbanks. Results on geomorphic impacts of floods have confirmed a prevalence of erosion processes in the study reaches of the Piave and Tagliamento rivers, even with a general tendency toward sediment equilibrium. Flooding has caused a nearly total reconfiguration of the main flowing channel network, contributing to erode considerable areas of stably vegetated banks. The analysis on bank migration processes has further found elements and relationships previously unconsidered in bank retreat modelling. Major findings on the King River include the proof that riparian trees mostly grow on the bank face as well as the identification of more complex patterns of hydrological erosion around riparian trees (overcutting and undercutting) suggesting tree toppling by fluvial scour than by mass failure. Further, the progression of scallop depth along riverbanks has confirmed to be fairly influenced by tree spacing, both on the King and the Piave rivers. Discussions debating the impacts of floods have highlighted the ability of events below bankfull discharge to effectively rework the geomorphological structure of river channels at all levels. River changes appear to be also influenced by the physical characteristics of river reaches and human interventions. Moreover, the new findings on bank migration have allowed to fill some gaps of knowledge related to the complex effect of trees on riverbank erosion, leading to propose a more comprehensive conceptual model describing bank retreat evolution in forested cohesive riverbanks. Further parallelisms between King and Piave rivers have demonstrated that scallop depth features similar average magnitudes in both fluvial systems, even though the average effect of tree spacing within individual morphological units (bend- or arc-level) explains better erosion development in the Piave River. The significance of the study lies on the attempt of providing a reliable approach to meaningfully evaluate river geomorphic changes, revealing the high potential of floods also below bankfull discharge to revolutionize channel forms and patterns. The enhanced understanding of crucial channel processes as the reconfiguration of main branches and the control of riparian vegetation on bank retreat can further represent a decisive help to river experts within the complicated issue of managing fluvial systems...|$|E
