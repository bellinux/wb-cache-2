5000|$|Radio is the {{dominant}} information tool to reach wide audiences in isolated, mountainous regions. The US military has deployed RIABs throughout Afghanistan in order {{to communicate with the}} residents. Due to a 70 percent illiteracy rate and lack of education in Afghanistan, radio is a vital communications tool used to broadcast information where radio ownership exceeds 80 percent. The United States military operates approximately 100 RIABs and hire local Afghan DJs in Afghanistan to broadcast information and host call-in shows. The United States Army employed RIAB systems to broadcast anti-Taliban and anti-Al Qaeda messages and countered Taliban propaganda by pushing onto Taliban frequencies in Paktia Province. One advantage of employing RIAB systems is the ability to broadcast vital information immediately to a large audience {{in the event of a}} crisis. One Afghan DJ has 50,000 listeners. Nawa District Governor Abdul Manaf uses the local RIAB station to conduct weekly call-in shows and believes the RIAB system is one of his best communication tools to inform a large audience. In Afghanistan's Paktika province, which has a literacy rate of two percent, an estimated 92 percent of the residents listen to the radio every day. Radio programs transmitted using RIAB systems provide beneficial information to Afghan farmers in remote areas. In the isolated, mountainous Wazi Kwah district of Paktika Province, a RIAB system supplies the only source of outside news. Afghan National Army commanders use the RIAB to communicate to villagers and elders and provide thoughts to the community. [...] Afghans can use information distributed by the United States military such as how to react to an approaching military convoy or purpose or use of U.S.-sponsored agriculture programs. For general news, Afghans can also use other <b>information</b> <b>outlets</b> such as the BBC or VOA because RIAB systems are controlled by the US military. Special Operations first employed RIAB systems in Afghanistan in 2005 which improved their ability to supply information to and communicate with the local population in their areas of operation.|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} the use of ICTs for accessing marketing <b>information</b> <b>outlets</b> in Oyo State, Nigeria. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 150 respondents for the study. Data collected were analysed using frequencies counts and percentages to describe the findings while, Chi-square and PPMC were used to test for relationship between the variables in the study hypotheses. The results of the findings showed that majority (70 %) of the sampled respondents were male while (69. 3 %) were married with (84 %) of them having a family size of less than five members. Large proportion (59. 3 %) of the respondents fall within the ages of 31 - 50 years, and majority (74. 7 %) of them were rural residence. The results also showed that majority (81. 3 %) of them required information for the sales of their agricultural products. The major sources of agricultural marketing <b>information</b> <b>outlets</b> to the respondents were fellow farmers (81. 3 %), radio (85. 4 %) and GSM (83 %). The study found that (61. 3 %) {{of the respondents were}} in low level category of ICTs users. Inferential statistics indicates that, there were significant relationship between level of use of ICTs for agricultural marketing information and marital status (? 2 = 10. 46, p> 0. 05) and level of educational attainment (? 2 = 16. 35, P> 0. 05). However, age (? 2 = 5. 5, p 2 = 5. 99, p 2 = 6. 22, p 0. 05), fellow farmers(r= 0. 19, p> 0. 05) and GSM (r= 0. 88, p> 0. 05) as a source of marketing information were highly significant.

We used a national online survey in conjunction with discrete choice models to investigate the impact of demographic characteristics, lifestyle preferences, and different <b>information</b> <b>outlets</b> on the probability that a consumer is or will become a CSA member. The results indicate that the factors affecting current and future CSA participation differ substantially. While none of the demographic characteristics has a significant impact on current CSA participation, some of them significantly affect the probability that a consumer will become a CSA member in the future. Lifestyle preferences {{have a significant impact on}} current and future CSA participation. Although none of the <b>information</b> <b>outlets</b> examined affect current CSA participation, word-of-mouth and online sources significantly influence the probability that a consumer will join a CSA program in the future.

40|$|The {{increasing}} disaffection towards {{politics and}} towards {{the mainstream media}} {{in some of the}} most traditional democracies became a notable feature at the end of the 20 th century. At the same time the Internet has appeared as a powerful medium, used by and competing with the mainstream media, offering new <b>information</b> <b>outlets,</b> whose social and political effects led to talk about the emergence of a new civil society: in this case a global civil society, thanks to the basic characteristics of the Net. The Internet constitutes a new a multidimensional Areopagus, where many individuals and communities meet, get information, and occasionally organize for action. There exists a varied and abundant literature on this topic, but it seemed pertinent to speak with those who run the mainstream media and see how they perceive the changes that have taken place as a consequence of the Internet.

40|$|In 2008, Anonymous {{launched}} ‘Project Chanology’ {{which was}} a direct attack on scientology. They ordered pizza’s to be delivered on scientology addresses, they attacked scientology websites with DDoS attacks and kept calling their main phone line. All in all, Anonymous played with the <b>information</b> <b>outlets</b> of scientology to take an activist standpoint against scientology. Here, activism is not solely about getting to the streets or letting your message heard, but it becomes about the control of flows of information. Anonymous transgresses boundaries of what activism is about, by using ‘new’ information tactics, furthermore, they transgress laws: worldwide many Anonymous’ members have been arrested. I propose to analyse Anonymous as a cheater that plays with information and with rules. And, just as cheaters, they raise questions on the rules, on {{what it means to}} be an activist, what the position is of protest online and more. In this thesis, I will formulate a new materialist conceptualization of cheating that will aid towards an understanding of what I will call Anonymous’ information activism. This research project is not about the question whether Anonymous is wrong or right, but rather it is about how we can understand these practices in their entanglements with the world. This is not an ethical question, but a call for a better understanding of the events pre-judgement. In this context, I am posing the question: How can we understand the cheater Anonymous as a key example of information activism...|$|E

40|$|To the {{unfamiliar}} eye {{the relation between}} metal music and community might seem like a contradiction. After all, how can community emanate from practices that to outsiders seem to foster loudness, extremity and violence? Those individuals that have enjoyed this musical genre {{at some point in}} their lives will probably have a very different appreciation of metal music and its culture in terms of community. In fact, many aspects of metal music point towards the importance of community as part of its practices. Some salient examples can be provided just to illustrate this argument. These include shared experiences (e. g. concerts, listening to music together), dress codes (e. g. use of recognizable band shirts), behavioral expectations (e. g. protection during mosh pits), use of collective <b>information</b> <b>outlets</b> (e. g. magazines, websites), and jointly discussed significant events (e. g. death of a musician). The central idea is that when these experiences are shared and valued by many persons, they can provide individuals with a sense of meaning and purpose that allows them to come together as a community. Although this may sound simple enough, it is actually quite a complex process. Beyond being a mere association of people, the complexity involves processes that concern exploring the expanse and the limits of the metal community and even dealing with paradoxes where although the music may be held in common, values such as political, artistic and ethical ones can be extremely diverse. Yet these are all held together under the banner of ‘metal’...|$|E
40|$|Media {{censorship}} is {{a global}} phenomenon that has foreshadowed <b>information</b> <b>outlets</b> for centuries. A common ground for censorship is maintenance of an orderly state, whereas, the underlying motive is to keep public ignorant {{of the information that}} can potentially threaten authorities. The worldwide Internet connectivity in the contemporary era allows information to pass through within and beyond borders in minimal time; therefore, increasing number of media consumers depend on the Internet {{for a wide variety of}} information. Historically, the access to news has not been this easy; the press in most of Europe in the 18 th century was under the draconian reins of censorship, which gradually abated by the 19 th century due to public demand. However, autocratic and heavily centralized governments still openly or subtly employ censorship as a tool to silence government opposition. To combat information coup, tech savvy journalists and independent reporters channel information through social media, blogs, and news websites. The governments survive by using stringent Internet surveillance apparatus that effectively block websites and subtly filter information; hence only selective news is allowed to penetrate the firewall. The governments also hunt down citizens and journalists accessing disallowed websites to create a ubiquitous atmosphere of fear, harassment, and persecution. The role of media in a society is not limited to bringing information to public; therefore, it is crucial that media does not capitalize on selling meaningless sensation that can potentially harm people, sects, races, and religions. This paper will focus on information coup through media censorship and the responsibility media is laden with to cultivate tolerance and responsibility in the public at large...|$|E
40|$|A Master's Dissertation, {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the Master of Science degree of the Loughborough University of Technology. The study examines the provision of bus passenger information in Leicestershire in a national and historical context. Recent transport legislation is analysed and found to affect information provision in that it fails to ascribe responsibility for it. A {{review of the literature}} provides the basis for an exploration of information needs. under the headings of users' specific needs and the means available to meet them. Against this background. research was conducted in Leicester and North-West Leicestershire by interview and by a survey of potential <b>information</b> <b>outlets.</b> Overall availability of information is satisfactory. in that there is no essential information which cannot be had; but there is much variation amongst organisations and locations. and the enquirer may have to work hard at getting enough information in time. The quality of information provided also varies: printed material is of a generally high standard. but one operator in particular provides a less than adequate telephone service. In general. the handling and dissemination of information by the operators leaves much to be desired. especially in those areas where the county council has least involvement. The council does a good job of gathering. handling and disseminating comprehensive information. as do some of the intermediaries. It is concluded that the county benefits from having a council which takes its information role seriously and which makes appropriate use of IT. The operators should concentrate on improving their performance within their natural domain. Non-specialist information providers should be fully committed or not participate. A legal framework for local authority action and a rationalisation of the Traffic Commissioners' role are recommended...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explains}} the free riding phenomenon in franchise chains where all chain members benefit mutually from the positive network externality of service quality. Starting {{from a simple}} formal model with two independent outlets, we present the analytical form of the optimal reaction function in which two outlets interact through service quality externalities. With complete <b>information,</b> no <b>outlet</b> finds any interest in free riding on service quality {{at the expense of}} the other. Contrary to previous findings, the positive demand externality increases the optimal service quality through interactions among chain members with complete information. By relaxing the complete information assumption, we demonstrate that incompleteness of information is the main source of free riding incentives. Contrary to the prevailing explanation based on agency theory, incompleteness of <b>information</b> leads <b>outlets</b> facing a smaller externality to free ride more on service quality compared to its optimal level with complete information.
