5000|$|Z-G (short for Zero Gravity) is {{the first}} {{collectible}} action figure game, created by Mark Rein·Hagen and released in 2001 as the first product of his solo company, Atomoton. It uses posable 4.5" [...] action figures with 14 points of articulation and each figure comes with 8 <b>interchangeable</b> <b>accessories</b> {{in the form of}} weapons/armour.|$|R
50|$|Design {{specifications}} {{relate to}} {{the characteristics of the}} telescope and how it performs optically. Several properties of the specifications may change with the equipment or accessories used with the telescope; such as Barlow lenses, star diagonals and eyepieces. These <b>interchangeable</b> <b>accessories</b> don't alter the specifications of the telescope, however they alter the way the telescopes properties function, typically magnification, angular resolution and FOV.|$|R
50|$|C series laptops were {{notable for}} their {{consistent}} and <b>interchangeable</b> <b>accessories</b> across this {{wide range of}} processors. The series {{was one of the}} first to offer the UXGA 1600x1200 resolution display and included a NVidia GeForce MX400 32 MB video accelerator to complement the display requirements. A robust design made it a favorite in harsher climates; however, this design lacked the visual appeal of many of its competitors.|$|R
5000|$|Beck {{spent three}} years {{developing}} the figurines with <b>interchangeable</b> <b>accessories</b> that became Playmobil. He conducted research {{that allowed him to}} develop a toy that would be flexible (unlike tin soldiers), not too complex, that would fit in an average child's hand and have a face like a child's drawing (a large head, smile, and no nose). [...] "I would put the little figures in their hands without saying anything about what they were," [...] Beck remarked. [...] "They accepted them right away... They invented little scenarios for them. They never grew tired of playing with them." [...] Horst Brandstätter was not initially convinced of the viability of Beck's idea, but allowed the inventor to continue developing the product.|$|R
500|$|At the American International Toy Fair, Mattel {{unveiled}} {{figures for}} Batman, Bane, and Catwoman, and Batman's flying vehicle, the Bat. The Mattel figures were also {{released in the}} [...] "Movie Masters" [...] line, featuring more highly detailed and articulated presentation, and Quiktek versions that feature <b>interchangeable</b> <b>accessories.</b> Lego released building sets and mini-figures based on the film and incorporating other DC Comic characters. Additionally, Funko released a series of plush toys, Mezco Toyz released vinyl figures, and Hornby released the Batman Tumbler car. Other partners include Jakks Pacific, who created novelty and large-scale figures and plush toys, and PPW Toys, who created a Batman themed Mr. Potato Head. Various clothing items including shoes, T-shirts, hats and wallets were also produced.|$|R
50|$|Arricam is a 35 mm movie camera line {{manufactured}} by Arri. It is Arri's flagship sync-sound camera line, replacing the Arriflex 535 line. The design {{was developed by}} Fritz Gabriel Bauer and Walter Trauninger, and is heavily derivative of the cameras Bauer created for his Moviecam company, which was bought out by Arri in the mid-1990s. As such, the Arricam is a fusion of the mechanical and intuitive design innovations of the Moviecam and the <b>interchangeable</b> <b>accessories</b> and complex electronic integration of the Arriflex. , the Arricam is considered, along with the Panaflex Millennium line, the top sync-sound camera system currently in usage, and is extremely popular amongst bigger budget feature films. The line comprises two camera body models, the ST (Studio) and LT (Lite). The Arricam ST is intended as a full-capability camera, including two camera magazine mounting configurations, whereas the Arricam LT is optimized for smaller, lightweight usage in handheld and Steadicam application, with only the option to mount the magazine in the rear position. Both cameras use motorized displacement magazines, have electronic rotating mirror shutters mounted beneath the film gate (as opposed to beside it, as in Panavision cameras), and contain independently adjustable sprocket pulleys within the camera body.|$|R
50|$|In 1952 the Asahi Optical Company (which {{later became}} {{well known for}} its Pentax cameras) {{introduced}} the first Japanese SLR using 135 film, the Asahiflex. Several other Japanese camera makers also entered the SLR market in the 1950s, including Canon, Yashica, and Nikon. Nikon's entry, the Nikon F, had a full line of <b>interchangeable</b> components and <b>accessories</b> and is generally regarded as the first Japanese system camera. It was the F, along with the earlier S series of rangefinder cameras, that helped establish Nikon's reputation as a maker of professional-quality equipment.|$|R
2500|$|Unit {{construction}} {{since its}} introduction has defined {{the development of}} the modern kitchen. Pre-manufactured modules, using mass manufacturing techniques developed during World War II, greatly brought down the cost of a kitchen. Units which are kept on the floor are called [...] "floor units", [...] "floor cabinets", or [...] "base cabinets" [...] on which a kitchen worktop – originally often formica and often now made of granite, marble, tile or wood – is placed. The units which are held on the wall for storage purposes are termed as [...] "wall units" [...] or [...] "wall cabinets". In small areas of kitchen in an apartment, even a [...] "tall storage unit" [...] is available for effective storage. In cheaper brands, all cabinets are kept a uniform color, normally white, with <b>interchangeable</b> doors and <b>accessories</b> chosen by the customer to give a varied look. In more expensive brands, the cabinets are produced matching the doors' colors and finishes, for an older more bespoke look.|$|R
