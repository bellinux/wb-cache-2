40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is the <b>futures</b> <b>option</b> pricing in {{electricity}} sector. We begin with description of fundamental features of futures options and describe specifics of electricity and markets where it is traded, which influenc option pricing. Further on, we will choose, according to defined criteria, three pricing methods resp. models that will be subject of our interest {{for the rest of}} the work - Black model, binomial model and Monte Carlo simulation. These models will be then briefly described and the basic idea of their approach to option pricing will be introduced. In the last, most important part, of this thesis we deal with empirical testing of all the three above mentioned pricing methods using data obtained from European Energy Exchange in Leipzig. In order to find best model for electricity <b>futures</b> <b>option</b> pricing we first calculate option premiums according to single models, these estimates are compared with the market premiums and based on the average percentage difference between these two values the most accurate model is chosen.

40|$|Index Futures and Index <b>Futures</b> <b>Option</b> Markets This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} option market microstructure on the inverse and asymmetric relationship between implied volatilities derived from index <b>futures</b> <b>option</b> and index futures returns. Our findings indicate that asymmetric responses of volatility changes to returns are essentially driven by the implied volatilities derived from low-delta (out-of-the-money) call options. The insignificant response based on high-delta (in-the-money) calls {{is consistent with the}} hedging pressure hypothesis of Bollen and Whaley (2003), which asserts that option buying pressure distorts the implied volatilities of low-delta puts, and, consequently, high-delta calls. Moreover, the profit maximization behavior in index option market also explains why the response of implied volatility from medium-delta (at-the-money) call options is weaker than tha...|$|E

40|$|Agricultural cooperatives {{tend to be}} riskier than investor-oriented firms, both in a {{business}} and financial sense. However, cooperative managers are often reluctant to actively manage risk. Although the risk management irrelevance proposition suggests that cooperative managers should be unable to add shareholder value through risk management activities, this study argues that {{there are several reasons}} why this {{is not likely to be}} the case for cooperatives. Several empirical examples are provided through numerical simulation of pro-forma financial statements from representative agricultural cooperatives. Using mean variance, expected utility and value-at-risk metrics, the results of these simulations show that various risk management strategies can improve the risk-return profile of a typical cooperative.

40|$|<b>Futures</b> <b>option</b> {{markets have}} {{experienced}} significant {{growth over the}} past decade as the contracts traded in 1992 were worth over 836 billion U. S. dollars. Despite the extensive empirical testing of option-pricing models for the spot option markets, only a few studies have empirically tested option pricing models for the rapidly growing currency futures market. Along with the expanding options on spot security markets, <b>futures</b> <b>option</b> markets have experienced significant growth in terms of trading volume in recent years. The trading of options on futures contracts started in 1983. Since then, the annual volume of futures options traded has grown from 281, 090 contracts in 1983 to 26, 739, 210 contracts in 1992. That is, the annual trading volume of contracts in 1992 is about 95 times the trading volume in 1983, with approximately 37 % of them being options on currency futures according to the annual volume statistics obtained from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Ball and Torous (1986), Shastri and Tandon (1986 a), and Ogden and Tucker (1987, 1988) conducted empirical studies investigating the currency futures options market using constant interest-rate option pricing models. With the recent development of new models, assumptions such as a constant interest rate have been relaxed. In contrast to most of the past studies, the primary objective {{of this paper is to}} empirically examine the impact of stochastic interest rates on currency <b>futures</b> <b>option</b> valuation. This study examines option contracts on five currency futures-the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, German Mark, Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc traded during the period January 1, 1991 to December 31, 1992. By explicitly accounting for stochastic interest rates, a stochastic interest-rate optionpricing model may lead to better estimates of the value of options on currency futures than a constant interest-rate model. In order to accomplish the primary objective of this research, the examination of the stochastic pricing model includes two parts: The price estimates from a stochastic interest rate model compared with actual observed currency <b>futures</b> <b>option</b> values. Comparisons between the price estimates from a stochastic interest-rate option pricing model and those from a constant interest-rate option pricing model. The paper is organized as follows: Section II provides an overview of a sample of the literature in this area. Section III describes the sample data and the methodology. Empirical results are presented and discussed in Section IV with discussion and conclusions given in Section V...|$|E

Controlling for option moneyness, delta-to-option-premium ratio, and liquidity, we find that net buying pressure, profit-maximization behavior, and liquidity are interrelated and affect asymmetric responses of implied volatilities to returns. Implied volatilities of options with more liquidity, a higher exercise price, and a higher delta-to-option-premium ratio have the most profound asymmetric response.

40|$|VIX futures are {{launched}} on 26 March 2004, and their underlying VIX obviously becomes {{an indicator of}} investors ’ confidence towards the U. S. equity market. Since VIX futures settle to the forward 30 -day implied volatility of the S&P 500, they are natural to hedge the “forward vega ” risk of S&P 500 options. Empirically, however, {{it is not known}} whether and by how much VIX futures improves hedging. This study fills this gap by first deriving a <b>futures</b> <b>option</b> model that allows volatility and jumps to be stochastic. Using VIX futures, S&P 500 futures and S&P 500 futures options, this study examines several alternative models within two types of hedging strategy, including (i) the minimum-variance hedge of option contracts that rely on the underlying futures as the single hedging instrument, and (ii) a delta-neutral hedge, in which as many hedging instruments as there are risk sources are used to make the net position completely risk-immunized (locally). For comparison, a forward-start strangle portfolio is constructed using S&P 500 options. Our findings show that VIX futures outperform forward-strangle strategy at most moneyness-maturity categories and the results are robust across models and hedging strategy. Overall, VIX futures are a better hedging instrument than standard options if the target option is a <b>futures</b> <b>option,</b> or equivalently if the risk exposure is the forward volatility risk. But for VIX futures, incorporating stochastic volatility and jumps yields the best hedging performance...|$|E
