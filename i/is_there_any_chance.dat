At that time, Tchaikovsky wrote Balakirev, [...] "Glazunov interests me greatly. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> that this young man could send me the symphony so that I might take a look at it? I should also like to know whether he completed it, either conceptually or practically, with your or Rimsky-Korsakov's help." [...] Balakirev replied, [...] "You ask about Glazunov. He is a very talented young man who studied for a year under Rimsky-Korsakov. When he composed his symphony, he did not need any help."

[...] Glazunov later sent Tchaikovsky a copy of his Poème lyrique for orchestra, about which Tchaikovsky had written enthusiastically to Balakirev, and had recommended for publication to his publisher P. Jurgenson.|$|E

2500|$|Sears's {{research}} has shown that Bigelow was quoting from a letter written in 1903 by an E. P. Halstead, who was on the staff of Doubleday's I Corps division. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> no evidence that Hooker and Doubleday ever met during the Gettysburg Campaign, nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of them meeting—they were dozens of miles apart. Finally, Doubleday made no mention of such a confession from Hooker in his history of the Chancellorsville Campaign, published in 1882. Sears concludes: ...|$|R

I was {{struggling}} for cash once and went in and told him I was going on holiday and <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of an advance. He {{got on the phone}} and said: [...] "Big Bryan Gunns coming down to sign a new contract." [...] It wasnt what I meant. I got my holiday money but he got another year out of me, too.|$|R

60|$|The {{early spring}} {{brought a new}} development. Thekla, who {{attended}} classes at the High School, came home with unmistakable tokens of measles, and Primrose did the same, in common with most of their contemporaries at Rockstone. Nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> that either Lily Underwood at Clipstone or Lena Merrifield at the Goyle would escape; indeed, they both showed an amount of discomfort that made it safer to keep them where they were, than to try to escape in the sharp east wind and frost.|$|R
