5|$|On 22 May 1799, Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, led a large column {{across the}} Rhine at Constance, Stein and Eglisau. Hotze's force had already crossed the Rhine further east, {{where it was}} still a {{mountain}} stream, and passed through the <b>Grisons,</b> into Toggenburg, and moved toward Zürich.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Grisons,</b> the {{situation}} also reverted to pre-war conditions. The Habsburgs could keep their rights over {{eight of the}} communes of the Zehngerichtebund, but also had to accept that league's alliance with the two other leagues and with the Swiss Confederacy. Ultimately, this arrangement {{would lead to the}} Habsburgs losing the Prättigau to the Three Leagues, {{with the exception of a}} temporary re-occupation during the Thirty Years' War nearly 130 years later.|$|E
5|$|This {{area had}} been {{dominated}} by the La Tène culture since the 5th century BC, settled by a mostly Celtic population (Gauls), of which the Helvetii were the most numerous, but which also included the Rauraci in north-west Switzerland centered on Basel, and the Allobroges around Geneva. South of the Swiss plateau were the Nantuates, Seduni and Veragri in the Valais, the Lepontii in the Ticino, while the Raetians controlled the <b>Grisons</b> as well as large areas around it.|$|E

5|$|By mid-May 1799, the Austrians had wrested {{control of}} parts of Switzerland from the French as forces {{under the command of}} Hotze and Count Heinrich von Bellegarde pushed them out of the <b>Grisons.</b> After {{defeating}} Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's 25,000-man Army of the Danube at the battles of Ostrach and Stockach, the main Austrian army, under command of Archduke Charles, crossed the Rhine at the Swiss town of Schaffhausen and prepared to unite with the armies of Hotze and Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, on the plains surrounding Zürich.|$|E
5|$|The {{refusal of}} the {{military}} leaders of the Swabian League to withdraw troops from the northern front {{to send them to}} the <b>Grisons</b> as Maximilian had demanded made the king return to Lake Constance. The differences between the Swabians, who preferred to strike in the north, and the king, who still hoped to convince them to help him win the struggle in the Val Müstair, led to a pause in the hostilities. Troops were assembled at Constance, but an attack did not occur. Until July, nothing of significance happened along the whole front.|$|E
5|$|To {{counter the}} Austrians, the French fielded {{an even larger}} array of forces. From Frankfurt am Main, Pierre Augereau and 16,000 troops {{threatened}} Simbschen's northern wing. Moreau controlled 107,000 of the main army, deployed in four wings. Bruneteau de Saint-Suzanne's 24,000-strong detached force occupied the north bank of the Danube near Ingolstadt, Grenier's 24,000-man Left Wing deployed {{on the west bank}} of the Isar River near Landshut. Moreau massed the 36,000 soldiers of the Center around Munich under his personal control. The Right Wing of Lecourbe defended the line of the upper Lech River farther west. Lastly, Jacques MacDonald with the 18,000-strong Army of the <b>Grisons</b> threatened Hiller's force from Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|As {{a direct}} {{connection}} between Tyrol and Milan, the <b>Grisons</b> {{and in particular the}} Val Müstair became strategically important to the Habsburgs. The Umbrail Pass in the Val Müstair connects the Vinschgau valley (Val Venosta) in southern Tyrol with the Valtellina in northern Italy. Furthermore, the Habsburgs and the Bishop of Chur had been quarrelling over the judicial rights over the region for some time. On January 20, 1499, Habsburg troops occupied the valley and plundered the Benedictine Convent of Saint John at Müstair, but were soon driven back by the forces of the Three Leagues, and an armistice was signed already on February 2 in Glurns (Glorenza), a village in the upper Vinschgau.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} for the French was dire. Not only had they been trounced in southwestern Germany, the legendary Alexander Suvorov {{was on his way}} to northern Italy with 60,000 Russians, to take command of Coalition forces there. Count Heinrich Bellegarde, positioned with 20,000 men in the <b>Grisons,</b> effectively isolated Masséna's force from any assistance out of Italy. Most threatening, Archduke Charles' main army lay less than a day away; in size alone, it could overwhelm him, or, if he withdrew to the west, its position cut off his avenue of withdrawal toward France. If Charles' left wing, commanded by Nauendorf, united with Hotze's force, approaching from the east, Masséna knew Charles would attack and very likely push him out of Zürich.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the war, the Swiss {{troops were}} no longer bound along the Rhine and in the <b>Grisons.</b> The cantons {{concluded}} new mercenary contracts, so called capitulations, with the Duchy of Milan and soon got deeply involved in the Italian Wars, where Swiss mercenaries ended up fighting on both sides. The involvement of the Old Swiss Confederacy, acting in its own interests in these wars, was brought to an end by the defeat against French forces in the battle of Marignano in 1515 and a subsequent peace treaty with the French king in 1516, the so-called Eternal Peace. However, Swiss mercenaries from individual cantons of the federation continued to participate in the Italian Wars well beyond (until the middle of the 16th century) in the service of various parties and, following that peace with France, in particular {{in the service of the}} French king.|$|E

5|$|Defrance {{also served}} in the Swiss Campaign of 1799 as divisional Chief of Staff of the 1st Division of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's Army of the Danube; after the losses at the battles of Ostrach and Stockach in March 1799, the Army of the Danube was {{combined}} with the Army of Helvetia, {{under the command of}} Andre Massena. Defrance continued in his capacity as divisional chief of staff. At the First Battle of Zurich in June 1799, he was appointed on the field as brigadier general, an honor which he declined, asking instead to be given command of a cavalry regiment. He received command of the 12th Regiment of Chasseurs-a-Cheval. As Chef-de-Brigade, the equivalent of colonel in France's revolutionary-era field army, Defrance went to Italy and participated in the actions leading up to the Battle of Marengo. During the winter of 18001801, he campaigned in the <b>Grisons</b> in Switzerland and returned to France after the Treaty of Lunéville in 1801.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this peace}} treaty affirmed {{the status quo}} ante bellum and thus the mixed {{jurisdiction}} over the <b>Grisons</b> between the Habsburgs, the bishopric of Chur, and the Three Leagues remained, the battle of Calven {{marked the end of}} the Habsburg expansion in the <b>Grisons.</b> The victory also strengthened the republican Three Leagues, who would consolidate their alliance in 1524. The Vinschgau, however, became a Habsburg territory in 1618, when the <b>Grisons</b> became a theater in the Thirty Years' War.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Grisons</b> {{had no such}} luck. The Three Leagues were a loose {{federation}} of 48 individual communes that were largely independent; their common assembly held no real powers. While this had helped avoid major religious wars during and following the Reformation, feuds between leading clans (e.g. between the von Planta and the von Salis) were common. When such a feud spilled over into the Valtellina in 1619, a subject territory of the Three Leagues, the population there responded in kind, killing the Protestant rulers in 1620 and calling Habsburg Spain for help. For the next twenty years, the <b>Grisons</b> was ravaged by war. For the Habsburgs, the <b>Grisons</b> was a strategically important connection between Milan and Austria. The Valtellina became Spanish, and other parts in the north-east of the <b>Grisons</b> were occupied and re-Catholicised by Austria.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Calven (Romansh: Chalavaina) {{took place}} on May 22, 1499 at the exit of the Val Müstair in the <b>Grisons</b> (now part of Switzerland) to the Vinschgau in County of Tyrol (now part of Italy) between the forces of king Maximilian I of the House of Habsburg {{and those of the}} free {{federation}} of the Three Leagues of the <b>Grisons.</b> It was the decisive battle in the southern <b>Grisons</b> of the Swabian War; after the defeat of the Habsburg troops, the king had to abandon his attempts to control the Engadin and the Val Müstair. The focus of operations in the Swabian War subsequently shifted again to the northern border of the Old Swiss Confederacy.|$|E

25|$|When <b>Grisons</b> {{became part}} of Switzerland in 1803, it had a {{population}} of roughly 73,000, of whom around 36,600 were Romansh speakers—many of them monolingual—living mostly within the Romansh-speaking valleys. The language border with German, which had mostly been stable since the 16th century, now began moving again {{as more and more}} villages shifted to German. One cause was the admission of <b>Grisons</b> as a Swiss canton, which brought Romansh-speakers into more frequent contact with German-speakers. Another factor was the increased power of the central government of <b>Grisons,</b> which had always used German as its administrative language. In addition, many Romansh-speakers migrated to the larger cities, which were German-speaking, while speakers of German settled in Romansh villages. Moreover, economic changes meant that the Romansh-speaking villages, which had mostly been self-sufficient, engaged in more frequent commerce with German-speaking regions. Also, improvements in the infrastructure made travel and contact with other regions much easier than it had been.|$|E
