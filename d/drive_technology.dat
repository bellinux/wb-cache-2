25|$|The FCV concept {{also uses}} {{portions}} of Toyota's Hybrid Synergy <b>Drive</b> <b>technology</b> including the electric motor, {{power control unit}} and other parts and components from its hybrid vehicles to improve reliability and minimize cost. The hybrid technology {{is also used to}} work together with the fuel cell. At low speeds such as city driving, the FCV runs just like any all-electric car by using the energy stored in its battery, which is charged through regenerative braking. At higher speeds, the hydrogen fuel cell alone powers the electric motor. When more power is needed, for example during sudden acceleration, the battery supports the fuel cell system as both work together to provide propulsion.|$|E
25|$|The {{band was}} praised for a unique use of USB flash <b>drive</b> <b>technology.</b> The band offered its 2004 Barenaked For the Holidays album on a {{customized}} flash drive in MP3 format, with extras including bonus tracks, and photos and videos {{from the studio}} sessions for the album. The band used a 128 MB USB flash drive, limiting the bitrate of the music included. The band described the product {{as a test of}} the technology and the market for that technology. It subsequently released Are Me in the USB format as well (on a 256 MB flash drive). The band also incorporated the technology into its live music sales, offering fans a copy of concerts in MP3 format on a USB stick at the merchandise booth directly after the show.|$|E

2500|$|The rest of {{the tracks}} are usually in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 2 and contain video and audio {{multiplexed}} in an MPEG program stream (MPEG-PS) container, but CD audio tracks are also allowed. Using Mode 2 Form 2 allows roughly 800 megabytes of VCD data to be stored on one 80 minute CD (versus 700 megabytes when using CD-ROM Mode 1). [...] This is achieved by sacrificing the error correction redundancy present in Mode 1. [...] It was considered that small errors in the video and audio stream pass largely unnoticed. [...] This, combined with the net bitrate of VCD video and audio, means that almost exactly 80 minutes of VCD content can be stored on an 80-minute CD, 74 minutes of VCD content on a 74-minute CD, and so on. This was done in part to ensure compatibility with existing CD <b>drive</b> <b>technology,</b> specifically the earliest [...] "1x" [...] speed CD drives.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} leave the current path (e.g., massive C 02 emissions, overconsumption and energy {{intensive}} and oil-based production systems) and head towards a more sustainable direction, the world needs fundamental transformations of local as well as global systems, including social, economic, and cultural ones. For this purpose, we have introduced the new notion of Dedicated Innovation Systems (DIS) as an overarching framework for transformations towards sustainability. DIS go beyond exploitation-oriented Innovation systems because they attempt to achieve a dynamic balance between demand <b>driven</b> <b>technology</b> pull, science and market <b>driven</b> <b>technology</b> push, and social innovation moderating social and ethical considerations (Seidler and Bawa, 2009). Social and ethical considerations add the dedication to innovation systems and help to overcome inertia due to potential entitlements of established actors. In DIS social resilience and broad participation in economic development play an outstanding role to gain momentum for the fundamental transformation.|$|R
