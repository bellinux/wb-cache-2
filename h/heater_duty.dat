40|$|There are two {{distillation}} {{units at}} the BAYERNOIL facility in Vohburg Germany [...] One of them processes only light crude oils {{whereas the other}} both light and heavy crude oils [...] The processing capacity of the second {{is limited by the}} <b>heater</b> <b>duty</b> which during the last three years and by processing heavy crude oils has often reached the maximal allowed duty [...] The main subject of this thesis is to evaluate the effect of an enhanced heat recovery capacity, available in the unit that processes only light crude oils by processing heavy crude oils and to determine where or not, the changeover of the distillation units operational mode is a viable option to overcome the current processing capacity limitation [...] Processing heavy crude oils in the unit with the enhanced heat recovery achieved an effective decrease on the <b>heater</b> <b>duty</b> of the crude distillation unit [...] However, the thermal dependency between the crude and the vacuum distillation units, caused an increase in the vacuum unit <b>heater</b> <b>duty</b> and a reduction in the steam generation [...] This showed that no energetic benefit is accomplished by changing the units operational modes, but rather a shift of the energy requirements in the studied system [...] Nevertheless, this energy shift reduces in the first instance the <b>heater</b> <b>duty</b> of the crude distillation unit, presenting an option to overcome the current processing capacity limitation by processing heavy crude oils [...] Processing heavy crude oils in the unit with the enhanced heat recovery, implies the permanent processing of light crude oils in the other unit [...] This generates heat losses by the final cool down of the atmospheric residue before it is taken to the storage tanks and presents an argument against a simple changeover of the distillation units operational mod...|$|E

40|$|Several radio-induced optical {{emissions}} {{were generated}} during an ionospheric heating experiment {{performed at the}} High Power Auroral Stimulation (HIPAS) facility near Two Rivers, Alaska. The O+ 732 – 733 nm and O(3 D o) 799. 0 nm emissions, previously unreported from ionospheric heating experiments, were detected, {{in addition to the}} already documented O(3 P) 844. 6 nm and O(5 P) 777. 4 nm emissions. Maximum emission intensity was observed in the magnetic zenith, when the heater was transmitting continuous wave O-mode, at a frequency of 2. 85 MHz. A modified Czerny-Turner grating spectrometer was used to acquire high resolution optical spectra of the induced emissions, which were synchronized to the <b>heater</b> <b>duty</b> cycle. Candidate mechanisms for the production of the radio-induced emissions, which occurred before the “double resonance” condition, are presented...|$|E
40|$|Fired heaters {{are both}} energy and capital {{intensive}} process equipment. Energy integration of fired heaters with the background process helps in targeting fuel requirement and air preheat temperature {{prior to its}} detailed design. Existing integration procedures are applicable for processes with single fired heater only. However, in certain processes, multiple fired heaters are required to satisfy the total hot utility demand. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to target the number of fired heaters. Fuel requirement and air preheat temperature for every fired heater {{may have to be}} re-estimated to set achievable targets. With multiple fired <b>heaters,</b> <b>duties</b> of different fired heaters can be varied to simplify the design of the overall heat exchanger network...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{integration}} of a fired heater with the background process helps in targeting fuel requirement {{and the air}} preheat temperature prior to its detailed design. Existing integration procedures are applicable only for processes with a single fired heater. However, in certain processes, multiple fired heaters are required to satisfy the total hot utility demand. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to target the minimum number of fired heaters. To synthesize an energy integrated heat recovery network that incorporates a single fired heater, a cold stream should enter the fired heater at the pinch temperature, and the heat capacity of the cold stream should be within a permissible range. For processes with multiple fired <b>heaters,</b> the <b>duties</b> of different fired heaters may be varied to simplify {{the design of the}} overall heat exchanger network. Entry conditions for cold process streams to the fired heaters are also established, to satisfy the overall energy target. In certain cases, the fuel requirement and air preheat temperature for every fired heater may have to be re-estimated to set achievable targets...|$|R
5000|$|Smart grid {{technologies}} {{emerged from}} earlier attempts at using electronic control, metering, and monitoring. In the 1980s, {{automatic meter reading}} was used for monitoring loads from large customers, and evolved into the Advanced Metering Infrastructure of the 1990s, whose meters could store how electricity was used {{at different times of}} the day. Smart meters add continuous communications so that monitoring can be done in real time, and {{can be used as a}} gateway to demand response-aware devices and [...] "smart sockets" [...] in the home. Early forms of such demand side management technologies were dynamic demand aware devices that passively sensed the load on the grid by monitoring changes in the power supply frequency. Devices such as industrial and domestic air conditioners, refrigerators and <b>heaters</b> adjusted their <b>duty</b> cycle to avoid activation during times the grid was suffering a peak condition. Beginning in 2000, Italy's Telegestore Project was the first to network large numbers (27 million) of homes using smart meters connected via low bandwidth power line communication. Some experiments used the term broadband over power lines (BPL), while others used wireless technologies such as mesh networking promoted for more reliable connections to disparate devices in the home as well as supporting metering of other utilities such as gas and water.|$|R
40|$|The Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Main Electronics Module (MEM) {{power supply}} heat sink {{temperature}} {{is critical to}} the Landsat- 7 mission. It is strongly dependent on the thermal louver design. A lower power supply heat sink temperature increases the reliability of the MEM, and reduces the risk of over heating and thermal shut-down. After the power supply failures in ETM+ instrument thermal vacuum tests # 1 and # 2, the author performed detailed thermal analyses of the MEM, and proposed to reduce the louver set-points by 7 C. At the 1998 Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference (IECEC), the author presented a paper that included results of thermal analysis of the MEM. It showed that a 70 C reduction of the louver set points could reduce the maximum power supply heat sink temperature in thermal vacuum test and in flight to below 20 "C in the cooler outgas mode and in the nominal imaging mode, and has no significant impact on the standby <b>heater</b> <b>duty</b> cycle. It also showed that the effect of Earth infrared and albedo on the power supply heat sink temperature is small. The louver set point reduction was implemented in June 1998, just prior to ETM+ thermal vacuum test # 3. Results of the thermal vacuum tests, and temperature data in flight validate the MEM thermal performance improvement due to the 70 C reduction of the louver set points...|$|E
