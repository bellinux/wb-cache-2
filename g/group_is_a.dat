The {{elements of the}} alternating group, called even permutations, are the products of even numbers of transpositions. The identity map, an empty product of no transpositions, is an even permutation since zero is even; it is the identity element of the group.|$|E

5|$|Many {{groups are}} {{simultaneously}} groups {{and examples of}} other mathematical structures. In the language of category theory, they are group objects in a category, meaning that they are objects (that is, examples of another mathematical structure) which come with transformations (called morphisms) that mimic the group axioms. For example, every group (as defined above) is also a set, so a <b>group</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> group object {{in the category of}} sets.|$|E

5|$|A <b>group</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{mathematical}} structure {{consisting of}} a set of objects together with a binary operation, that is, an operation combining any two objects to a third, subject to certain requirements. A group in which the objects are matrices and the group operation is matrix multiplication is called a matrix group. Since in a group every element has to be invertible, the most general matrix groups are the groups of all invertible matrices of a given size, called the general linear groups.|$|E
5|$|About 30% of agrichemicals contain fluorine, {{most of them}} {{herbicides}} and fungicides with a few crop regulators. Fluorine substitution, usually of {{a single}} atom or at most a trifluoromethyl <b>group,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> robust modification with effects analogous to fluorinated pharmaceuticals: increased biological stay time, membrane crossing, and altering of molecular recognition. Trifluralin is a prominent example, with large-scale use in the U.S. as a weedkiller, {{but it is a}} suspected carcinogen and has been banned in many European countries. Sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) is a mammalian poison in which two acetic acid hydrogens are replaced with fluorine and sodium; it disrupts cell metabolism by replacing acetate in the citric acid cycle. First synthesized in the late 19th century, it was recognized as an insecticide in the early 20th, and was later deployed in its current use. New Zealand, the largest consumer of 1080, uses it to protect kiwis from the invasive Australian common brushtail possum. Europe and the U.S. have banned 1080.|$|E
5|$|Basic to {{the second}} <b>group</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> clade {{consisting}} of both species sofar included in Ploceus that live on Madagascar, P. nelicourvi and P. sakalava, and these are morphologically very distinct from the remaining species. These two species could in future be assigned to the genus Nelicurvius that was erected by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850, but which was merged with Ploceus later on. This second group further contains the genera Malimbus and Anaplectes, and all remaining Ploceus species.|$|E

5|$|His 1952 {{paper on}} the subject, {{together}} with a paper published concurrently by Deane Montgomery and Leo Zippin, solves affirmatively the restricted version of Hilbert's fifth problem, showing that indeed every locally Euclidean <b>group</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Lie group. Gleason's contribution was to prove that this is true when G has the no small subgroups property; Montgomery and Zippin showed every locally Euclidean group has this property. As Gleason told the story, the key insight of his proof was to apply the fact that monotonic functions are differentiable almost everywhere. On finding the solution, he took a week of leave to write it up, and it was printed in the Annals of Mathematics alongside the paper of Montgomery and Zippin; another paper a year later by Hidehiko Yamabe removed some technical side conditions from Gleason's proof.|$|E
5|$|In {{physical}} terms the function is {{represented as a}} superposition of sine waves and the coefficients give information about the function's frequency spectrum. A complex-number form of Fourier series is also commonly used. The concrete formulae above are consequences of a more general mathematical duality called Pontryagin duality. Applied to the group R, it yields the classical Fourier transform; an application in physics are reciprocal lattices, where the underlying <b>group</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> finite-dimensional real vector space endowed with the additional datum of a lattice encoding positions of atoms in crystals.|$|E
5|$|The Lorentz <b>group</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Lie {{group and}} has {{as such a}} Lie algebra, The Lie algebra is a vector space of {{matrices}} {{that can be said}} to model the group near the identity. It is endowed with a multiplication operation, the Lie bracket. With it, the product in the group can near the identity be expressed in Lie algebraic terms (but not in a particularly simple way). The link between the (matrix) Lie algebra and the (matrix) Lie group is the matrix exponential. It is one-to-one near the identity in the group.|$|E

5|$|The Marshlink Action <b>Group</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{volunteer}} group {{set up in}} 2003 in {{the interests}} of passengers using the line. The group are concerned about its facilities, particularly the use of Class 171 DMUs when all connecting lines have been electrified. They have reported a high proportion of children and the elderly use the line compared to others in the south east, and that trains are now at capacity but there is no additional stock because of its state as an isolated non-electric line. In 2016, Rudd chaired a working group to look at short and long-term plans for upgrading the Marshlink line, including the potential accommodation of Class 395 rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|The Millennium <b>Group</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fictional {{secret society}} {{featured}} in the crime thriller television series Millennium.

Despite being fraught with internal schisms, the Group tried on several occasions to artificially instigate the end of the world as the year 2000 approached.|$|E
5|$|The Snow Prince Gasshōdan <b>group</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{temporary}} boy choir {{that was}} formed specially for this movie, {{and it is}} led by actor Shintaro Morimoto.

Snow Prince Gasshōdan {{is made up of}} 10 boys, who together, had an average age of 10.5 years {{at the time of the}} filming. This makes the group Snow Prince Gasshōdan the youngest group in the history of all the Johnny Jr. idol groups to release a single. According to the movie's release committee, the group Snow Prince Gasshōdan existed until the end of 2010 before it was disbanded. Leader Shintaro Morimoto expressed hope the group could be reunited again after 10 years.|$|E
