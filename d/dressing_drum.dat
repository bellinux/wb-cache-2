5000|$|In full parade <b>dress,</b> <b>drum</b> majors of many U.S. {{military}} bands wear bearskin hats. The {{origin of}} the use of bearskins in U.S. military bands dates to 1855 when United States Marine Band director Francis Scala adopted the style for that ensemble in emulation of European trends. This transition occurred as the band was reorganizing itself from a traditional American fife and drum corps into its modern incarnation. A shortage of bearskins in the late 1880s caused the price of the hats to skyrocket, with The New York Times then reporting their use might be phased out entirely. [...] "It can readily be seen what a price has to be paid for keeping up a custom which is rather old, it is true, but is practically a useless one save for the purpose of military display," [...] the newspaper opined.|$|R

25|$|Sand Point {{is a mixed}} Native and non-Native community. More than 50% of the {{permanent}} residents in Sand Point are known as Aleuts or Unangan. Every July the town hosts a Culture Camp in which Aleut traditions such as dance, sewing Aleut <b>dresses,</b> playing <b>drums,</b> building kayaks, knot tying, and weaving are taught. Culture Camp has an Aleut language component built into the program.|$|R
50|$|The New Visions {{fashion show}} is a success, {{especially}} since the models used were not professionals but under-privileged girls like Champagne. However, when a dress goes missing, everyone is quick to accuse Champagne. Cammie deduces that Martin Rittenhouse, the designer, deliberately hid the <b>dress</b> to <b>drum</b> up publicity. Since Lizbette decided Champagne was not right for her company after all, Cammie coerces Martin to launch a petite fashion line and use Champagne as his star model lest she ruin his reputation. Martin quickly agrees and Champagne is thrilled.|$|R
50|$|During the Holy Week, {{there is}} a {{traditional}} tamborada, a collective drumming, which can last all day long. In southern Spain, tamboradas are characteristic of Moratalla {{as well as of}} Mula (in Murcia) and Hellín and Tobarra (in Albacete). A unique aspect of Moratalla's Holy Week is that every tamborista (<b>drummer)</b> <b>dresses</b> in distinct, handmade robes. Drums are also traditionally handmade.|$|R
50|$|The Bell-boy Jacket is {{modelled}} on uniforms traditionally worn by hotel bell-boys and messengers, {{consisting of}} a very fitted waist-length jacket and a band collar, often double-breasted and trimmed with fancy braid or piping, and rows of close-set brass buttons. The cuffs of the jacket often have similar decoration. The style is based on 19th century military <b>dress</b> uniforms and <b>drummer</b> boys.|$|R
50|$|Kettle Drums: By {{command of}} King George II the silver kettle drums {{captured}} by The King's Own Regiment of Dragoons, later the 3rd Hussars, at Dettingen are borne by a drum horse ridden by a Sergeant Kettledrummer - both being additional to the regimental establishment. The drums are always carried {{at the head}} of the regiment on ceremonial parades and are, uniquely amongst cavalry regiments, never covered by drum banners, the battle honours being engraved directly onto the sides of the drums. In 1772 when Lord Southampton commanded the regiment, his wife gave a silver collar to be worn by the Kettledrummer, which is still worn today when parading in full <b>dress</b> with the <b>drums.</b> The present drum horse is named Alamein and its nickname is Dudley.|$|R
5000|$|As in most {{churches of}} the Anglican Communion world-wide {{apart from the}} Diocese of Sydney in Australia, the churchmanship, as {{demonstrated}} by the Papua New Guinea Prayer Book, is Anglo-Catholic: the normative Sunday service is the Eucharist, commonly referred to as [...] "Mass"; Mattins is virtually unknown; clergy are addressed as [...] "Father" [...] (there are no women clergy). Religious orders — the Melanesian Brothers and the Anglican Franciscans — play a considerable role {{in the life of the}} church. Oro tapa cloth is a characteristic feature of church decoration and liturgical vestments, as befits a denomination substantially characterised by Oro people, and church festivals are often marked by congregants appearing in traditional Oro <b>dress,</b> with Oro <b>drumming</b> and singing.|$|R
50|$|The Stranglers drew {{upon their}} back {{catalogue}} {{and a large}} audience all singing to the tunes of Golden Brown and Peaches amongst others. Fat Samba drew on a large, excited crowd as they lead the fancy <b>dress</b> parade, tight <b>drumming</b> and eccentric costumes helped {{to win over the}} crowd. Gogol Bordello were an unknown quantity initially but after their set it became clear they were an eccentric, innovative and colossal quantity of music talent, lead singer Eugene Hutz was particularly entertaining, reminiscent of Freddie Mercury on stage. Youngblood Brass Band dazed the crowd with their no nonsense, get on stage and perform attitude. The unusual miz of trombones, trumpets, drummers, a tuba player and a rapper/snare drummer, the band performed an energetic set got the crowd jumping and dancing.|$|R
5000|$|These mock Indian encampments {{included}} traditional Indian <b>dress,</b> dances, and <b>drumming.</b> Indians {{from both}} the Nez Perce and Yakama tribes were frequent attendees. The {{reason for this is}} because the rodeo circuit mirrored the tradition seasonal round, or nomadic ways of life, that Indians had traditionally followed before the treaties that established reservations in 1855. These rodeos provided McWhorter with the opportunity to interview multiple Indians, [...] "…with each rodeo or fair McWhorter learned more of the tribal oral tradition and he recorded what he heard. He well understood the unique opportunity at hand." [...] The vast plethora of interviews provided McWhorter with the ability to fact check his history quite easily. Facts were often repeated by multiple persons, thus adding more weight to their potential for being faithful accounts of events. Furthermore the rodeos provided the Indians and McWhorter as well, with a source of income.|$|R
500|$|Blyton {{published}} several further books {{featuring the}} character of Scamp the terrier, following on from The Adventures of Scamp, a novel she had released in 1943 under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock. Scamp Goes on Holiday (1952) and Scamp and Bimbo, Scamp at School, Scamp and Caroline and Scamp Goes to the Zoo (1954) were illustrated by Pierre Probst. She introduced {{the character of}} Bom, a stylish toy <b>drummer</b> <b>dressed</b> in a bright red coat and helmet, alongside Noddy in TV Comic in July 1956. A book series began the same year with [...] Bom the Little Toy Drummer, featuring illustrations by R. Paul-Hoye, and followed with Bom and His Magic Drumstick (1957), Bom Goes Adventuring and Bom Goes to Ho Ho Village (1958), Bom and the Clown and Bom and the Rainbow (1959) and Bom Goes to Magic Town (1960). In 1958 she produced two annuals featuring the character, {{the first of which}} included twenty short stories, poems and picture strips.|$|R
500|$|Madonna also {{performed}} [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin" [...] {{the same year}} on The MDNA Tour. After the performance of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] ended, she began performing [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin" [...] <b>dressed</b> as a <b>drum</b> majorette in a white-and-red uniform with tall white boots. Phillips explained that the ensemble was created and inspired by a 1940s majorette look, and she added Swarovski crystals to the dress. Madonna sang the song on stage while a drumline was suspended in mid-air, and M.I.A. and Minaj appeared on the video screen. Caryn Ganz from Spin called the performance as the [...] "night's most innovative moment" [...] while Brian McManus from Rolling Stone {{was impressed with the}} drumline levitation on top of the stage. Niv Elis from The Jerusalem Post declared the performance as one of the show's [...] "wow" [...] moments. The November 19–20, 2012, performance of [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin" [...] at Miami, American Airlines Arena, was recorded and released in Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour in CD and DVD.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} is comical and {{features}} fast motion at times. It begins with keyboardist Tony Hymas arriving and taking out a [...] "roll out" [...] keyboard from his case and applying it onto the piano to play. It then moves on to lead singer Jim Diamond, who is a butcher, chopping meat and dancing with a pig that has a number on it, as he would be with [...] "Suzi" [...] when they go ballroom dancing which then features a judge who appears constantly with two scorecards. It moves on to Suzi who is at a salon getting her hair done and decides to dance with a hairdryer surprising the salonist. It then shows Diamond with his tuxedo on, ironing his trousers with steam arising. When he looks into the mirror, a picture appears of the guy that he imagines he {{would be at the}} dance; this is also the same with Suzi. It then features the stylist (who is presumably Ruby in the song) eating a pickled egg with a cold cuts fork (the eggs are used as a running gag throughout the video). Suzi then picks up her <b>dress</b> from <b>drummer</b> Mark Craney in the closet, with the judge appearing from the hamper. Diamond arrives to pick up Suzi who comes running to his motorcycle with the trailer somehow gotten unhitched. Suzi then is seen riding behind Diamond on the motorcycle as they arrive at Hammersmith Palais featuring other ballroom dancers. Ruby, who is the saxophonist, quickly arrives at the hall trying to blow into the sax which is clogged by a pickled egg which amuses her and she eats it and continues her solo. The reoccurring judge gives them a 10, and they have won. As Suzi approaches the stage in a dignified manner, the prize is a jar of pickled eggs with the other dancers leaving in dismay. The video ends with Hymas rolling up his keyboard from the piano back into his case and leaving the stage.|$|R
2500|$|The {{show was}} opened by Páll Rósinkrans, {{performing}} [...] "Fósturjörð" [...] (Motherland), composed and written by Einar Scheving. {{the song is}} a ballad, which Rósinkrans performed in a black suit and white shirt, and was joined on stage by a pianist, drummer, cellist and violinist, all in black. Second was Ingó, who performed [...] "Undir regnbogann" [...] (Under the rainbow), which was composed by Hallgrímur Óskarsson and written by Eiríkur Hauksson. The song is a cheerful, which Ingó performs on stage with a ukulele, and he was accompanied on stage by three male backing singers in black, as well as female trombonist and <b>drummer,</b> <b>dressed</b> in white. the penultimate performance was by Hreindís Ylva Garðarsdóttir Holm, who performed [...] "Vornótt" [...] (Spring night), which was composed by Erla Gígja Þorvaldsdóttir and written by Hilmir Jóhannesson. The song is a mid-tempo song, which Holm performs in {{a black and white}} polka dot dress. She is accompanied on stage by a harpist, guitarist and two female backing singers, all in black. The final performer on stage was Erna Hrönn Ólafsdóttir with [...] "Glópagull" [...] (Fool's gold), composed and written by Einar Oddsson. The song is more rock in nature to the other songs in this semi-final, with Hrönn performing in a black and red dress, and joined on stage by two male and two female backing singers, all in black.|$|R
5000|$|All parade {{practice}} runs {{began on}} 26 March 2016 in Alabino {{with the first}} practice run through for the ground column, kicking off the month long national preparations for Victory Day, and will last even {{until the middle of}} April when the runs on Red Square for the national parade itself will start, ending with a final general combined practice run of the parade in early May. From the 3rd week of March up to the 3rd week of April, the Alabino military training center serves as the parade training ground for the estimated 12,000 military personnel in attendance for the Moscow parade, plus more than 175 vehicles and 80 aircraft. Also rehearsing for the parade are the massed military bands of the Armed Forces, the MVD, EMERCOM and the Moscow Garrison, all to be conducted for the 14th straight year by Lieutenant General Valery Khalilov, the Senior Director of Music of the Bands Service of the Russian Armed Forces since 2002, with a combined number of more than a thousand military bandsmen, and the world-famous Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College [...] "Field Marshal Alexander Suvorov", under the leadership of Colonel Alexander Gerasimov, the long-time college director, which has always (with a brief break from 2009 to 2011) had the traditional privilege starting 1940 of leading the parade proper, distinguished by their dark blue and red <b>dress</b> uniforms, snare <b>drums</b> and fifes, plus the color guard unit.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{features}} {{an eclectic mix}} of electro/dance pop, soulful ballads and even the occasional stab at social commentary. The influences vary from pop, rock and hip-hop to dance, electropop, and techno <b>dressed</b> in heavy <b>drums,</b> synths, and guitars. This album differs slightly from their earlier albums, Electropop and Jupiter Rising musically using more spacy synths and live instruments featured on songs like Falling Away, L.A. Girls, and Tres Cool.The inspiration behind album for Spencer [...] "was everything that I wanted to get out and do [...] Even before it was my project there used to be like six people in this band, and prior to that we all had an idea of where we wanted to go and that somewhere got lost in between pre-production and actually making the record. What we ended up with wasn’t necessarily what I wanted to create but I happened {{to be the one to}} own up to it." [...] The sound of this new album is rooted in programmed-electro, but using live instruments on it. [...] "It's live and raw", the band says, [...] "but also a little futuristic with synthesizers. We've been tracking live drums on almost every song and tracking guitars on almost every song, and playing piano and keyboards, but also doing programs with synthesizers and soft synths, and tricks with vocodors and vocals." [...] “We’re making a fresh and electric album with lots of great tracks like “Fallin’ Away,” “Tres Cool” and a shout out to our home LA with ‘LA Girl,’ explains Payo. [...] Guest musicians on new album include: Brent Paschke (guitar); Mike Shapiro (Drums) and Mike Garcon (Keyboards).|$|R
5000|$|High Voltage and {{a single}} with [...] "Baby, Please Don't Go" [...] were {{released}} simultaneously in Australia in February 1975. AllMusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia called the song [...] "positively explosive". Albert Productions issued it as the single's B-side. However, the A-side was largely ignored and [...] "Baby, Please Don't Go" [...] began receiving airplay. The single entered the chart {{at the end of}} March 1975 and peaked at number 10 in April. Also on 23 March 1975, one month after drummer Phil Rudd and bassist Mark Evans joined AC/DC, the group performed the song for the first time (this performance would also be repeated on 6 April and 27 April which is why there is often conflicting dates for this performance) on the Australian music program Countdown. For their appearance, [...] "Angus wore his trade mark schoolboy uniform while Scott took the stage wearing a wig of blonde braids, a dress, make-up, and earrings", according to author Heather Miller. Joe Bonomo describes Scott as [...] "a demented Pippi Longstocking", and Perkins notes his [...] "tattoos and a disturbingly short skirt." [...] Evans describes the reaction: As soon as his vocals are about to begin he comes out from behind the <b>drums</b> <b>dressed</b> as a schoolgirl. And it was like a bomb went off in the joint; it was pandemonium, everybody broke out in laughter. Scott had a wonderful sense of humor. Scott mugs for the camera and, during the guitar solo/vocal improvization section, he lights a cigarette as he duels with Angus with a green mallet. Rudd laughs throughout the performance. Although [...] "Baby, Please Don't Go" [...] was a popular part of AC/DC's performances (often as the closing number), the song was not released internationally until their 1984 compilation EP '74 Jailbreak. The video from the Countdown show is included on the Family Jewels DVD compilation in 2005.|$|R
