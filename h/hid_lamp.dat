Studies have demonstrated drivers react faster and more accurately to roadway obstacles with good HID headlamps than halogen ones. Hence, good HID headlamps contribute to driving safety. The contrary argument is that glare from HID headlamps can reduce traffic safety by interfering with other drivers' vision.|$|E
50|$|The {{white marble}} friezes also {{decorate}} the pylons and lighting {{is achieved by}} <b>hidden</b> <b>lamps</b> in the niches of the central vault, and by lamps on the platforms. The walls are covered with orange tiles and the floor is made of various shades of granite arranged in a traditional Ukrainian ornament layout. In {{the end of the}} station is white marbled wall, before which a large statue of Vladimir Lenin used to sit. However this was dismantled in the early 1990s, making the station lose its original look.|$|R
50|$|Khreshchatyk (Хрещатик) is {{a station}} on the Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line of the Kiev Metro. The station is named for the Khreshchatyk street, the most central street in Kiev. The station was opened in 1960 along with {{the first stage of}} the Metro. The station is pylon trivault (architects Yu.Tyahno and I.Maslenkov) that {{features}} ceramic Ukrainian ornaments framed by metallic grills on the central hall sides of the pylons. White marble is used elsewhere, particularly for the walls and the main pylon frames. The ceiling is covered in white plaster and lighting comes from <b>hidden</b> <b>lamps</b> in the niches of the central vault and a central row of lamps.|$|R
50|$|The vault {{is a white}} {{plastered}} {{solid shape}} with blue metallic stripes coming off into the walls. A long aluminium shape bisects its length. The walls are coated with brown marble and blue mosaic and the floor is a delicate pattern of red and grey granite. Lighting comes from the central aluminium shape and from <b>hidden</b> <b>lamps</b> behind the wall niches. Additional lighting comes from lampposts on the {{opposite ends of the}} platform. The vestibule ceiling is located on the same level as the vault apex making the appearance of a streamlined feature. The station has two vestibules {{on opposite sides of the}} Khrakivska Square these are interconnected with subways that have large glazed pavilions on the surface. For the first time in Metro's history, disabled access was given thought, and the station features lifts down to the platform level, wheelchair ramps and staircase angular rails.|$|R
2500|$|An {{inductor}} is {{very common}} in line-frequency ballasts to provide the proper starting and operating electrical condition to power a fluorescent lamp, neon lamp, or high intensity discharge (<b>HID)</b> <b>lamp.</b> (Because {{of the use of}} the inductor, such ballasts are usually called magnetic ballasts.) The inductor has two benefits: ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the higher}} {{efficiency}} of the ballast itself and the higher lamp efficacy at higher frequency, electronic ballasts offer higher system efficacy for low pressure lamps like the fluorescent lamp. For HID lamps, there is no improvement of the lamp efficacy in using higher frequency, but for these lamps the ballast losses are lower at higher frequencies and also the light depreciation is lower, meaning the lamp produces more light over its entire lifespan. Some <b>HID</b> <b>lamp</b> types like the ceramic discharge metal halide lamp have reduced reliability when operated at high frequencies {{in the range of}} for these lamps a square wave low frequency current drive is mostly used with frequency in the range of , with the same advantage of lower light depreciation.|$|E
2500|$|High-intensity {{discharge}} (HID) {{lights were}} the brightest lights available for bicycles until recently eclipsed by the advances in LED lights. [...] They are very efficient, very bright, but expensive. They {{also tend to}} have high power consumption (although they use less power than halogens for higher output), so a relatively limited burn time. Otherwise {{they have the same}} advantages and disadvantages as rechargeable halogen systems, and like halogen systems they are designed primarily for off-road use, having rotationally symmetrical beams which cast as much light up as down. [...] An additional disadvantage compared with halogen or LED lights is that the <b>HID</b> <b>lamp</b> does not tolerate repeated strikes, and in many cases does not relight immediately after shutting down. [...] Likewise, should the battery level fall too low, the lamp will shut down rather than dimming. [...] But the longer battery life than halogens tends to negate these problems, as many riders simply switch the light on and leave it running throughout the ride.|$|E
5000|$|The design {{features}} four rows of columns which support the vaults, though the columns are [...] "doubled" [...] hence their wide appearance. In {{the centre of}} the station is a large open space with a large vault topping it that rests on four pylons forming an arbour, from which a staircase leads off as a transfer to Kurskaya-Radialnaya of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line. Another interesting detail of the station is the lack of sculptures and artwork, instead however this compensated by small details such as Torchiere (now removed) in the arbour which light the granite stairwell and <b>hidden</b> <b>lamps</b> in the nieches of the vault, which is covered by a bronze frieze symbolising the dawn and blossoming of Mother Russia. Additional lighting is provided by eight elegant conical chandeliers with fluorescent tubes. The floor is laid with red and grey granite, and the walls and columns with white koyelga marble.|$|R

So lovely was it that I caught my breath and the Prince at my side started. Indeed {{it was more than}} lovely, for as a lamp shines through an alabaster vase or a shell of pearl so did the spirit within this woman shine through her tear-stained face, making it mysterious as the night. Then I understood, perhaps for the first time, that it is the spirit which gives true beauty both to maid and man and not the flesh. The white vase of alabaster, however shapely, is still a vase alone; it is the <b>hidden</b> <b>lamp</b> within that graces it with the glory of a star. And those eyes, those large, dreaming eyes aswim with tears and hued like richest lapis-lazuli, oh! what man could look on them and not be stirred? ...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{phenomenon}} {{associated with}} <b>HID</b> <b>lamp</b> wear and aging is discoloration of the emitted light beam ("fading"). Commonly, a shift towards blue and/or violet can be observed. This shift is slight {{at first and}} is more generally {{a sign of the}} lamps being [...] "broken in" [...] whilst still being in good overall working order, but towards the end of its life, the <b>HID</b> <b>lamp</b> is often perceived as only producing blue and violet light. Based on Planck's law, this {{is a direct result of}} the increased voltage and higher temperature necessary to maintain the arc.|$|E

5000|$|While Thomas {{had been}} battling for the Mosquito's future Issigonis had been {{settling}} the car's styling. Although {{in his later}} career he would be known for very functional designs Issigonis was heavily influenced by the modern styling of American cars, especially the Packard Clipper and the Buick Super. A new feature was a low-set headlamps, integral with the grille panel (Issigonis had originally sketched <b>hidden</b> <b>lamps</b> concealed behind sections of the grille, but these were never implemented). The original Mosquito prototype, which drew Lord Nuffield's [...] "poached egg" [...] comment, was designed with similar proportions to pre-war cars, being relatively narrow for its length. In late 1947, with Cowley already tooling up for production, Issigonis was unhappy {{with the appearance of}} the car. He had the prototype cut lengthways and the two halves moved apart until it looked [...] "right". The production model was thus four inches (10 cm) wider than the prototype and, in keeping with Issigonis' design principles, this further improved interior space and roadholding. It also gave the car distinctive (and recognisably modern) proportions - contrast with the Austin A30, launched in 1952 but still recognisably pre-war in size and proportions). The last-minute change to the design required a number of workarounds - bumpers had already been produced, so early cars had ones cut in half with a four-inch plate bolted between the join. The bonnet had a flat fillet section added to its centreline and the floorpan had two two-inch sections added either side of the transmission tunnel.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{types of}} {{chemistry}} {{are used in}} the arc tubes of HID lamps, depending on the desired characteristics of light intensity, correlated color temperature, color rendering index (CRI), energy efficiency, and lifespan. Varieties of <b>HID</b> <b>lamp</b> include: ...|$|E
50|$|A {{less common}} type of {{flashlight}} uses a High Intensity Discharge (<b>HID)</b> <b>lamp</b> as the light source. An HID gas discharge lamp uses a mixture of metal halide salts and argon as a filler. HID lamps produce more light than an incandescent flashlight using {{the same amount of}} electricity. The lamp will last longer and is more shock resistant than a regular incandescent bulb, since it lacks the relatively fragile electrical filament found in incandescent bulbs. However, they are much more expensive, due to the ballast circuit required to start and operate the lamp. An <b>HID</b> <b>lamp</b> requires a short warm-up time before it reaches full output.A typical HID flashlight would have a 35 watt lamp and produce more than 3,000 lumens.|$|E

While there were flicker boxes installed in the Hall of Warriors set in order to give the appearance of fire, overhead blue lighting was used in the prison in order to make the set look much colder. Because of the size of the Hall of Warriors, cinematographer Jonathan West used bleached muslin to <b>hide</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> in the window treatments.|$|R

50|$|Architecturally {{the station}} is a tri-vault wall column design with a {{monolithic}} concrete plate on the floor. The theme, work of architects V. Fillipov, S. Petrosyan, A. Ruban, T.

Contrasting with that is the dark green marble used for columns, and for panels between the portals {{as well as for}} panels on the station walls. The floor features a geometric layout which repeats the portals out of polished dark green, black and light grey granite. Lighting is achieved by <b>hidden</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> behind the portal cornices which unite every four passages between the central and the platform halls. The vaults of the central (9.5 metre diameter) and the platform halls are covered with white fibreglass to offer extra hydroisolation.|$|R
