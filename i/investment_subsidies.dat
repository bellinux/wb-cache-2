While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. <b>Investment</b> <b>subsidies</b> are paid out {{as a function of}} the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance.

After {{the end of}} Apartheid South Africa's newly elected government struggled with the then growing service and backlogs with respect to access to {{water supply and sanitation}} developed. The government thus made a strong commitment to high service standards and to high levels of <b>investment</b> <b>subsidies</b> to achieve those standards. Since then, the country has made some progress with regard to improving access to water supply: It reached universal access to an improved water source in urban areas, and in rural areas the share of those with access increased from 66% to 79% from 1990 to 2010.|$|E

The private sector makes a limited contribution to finance, mostly through a single BOT that has so far been awarded for a US$160 million wastewater treatment plant. Between 2005 and 2010 Egypt received more than 1bn Euro in external aid for water supply and sanitation, out of which 30% were grants and the remainder soft loans with an average interest rate of 1%. This corresponds to EUR 200 million per year, corresponding to only about 10% of the government's investment budget for the sector in 2009/10. According to the Ministry of Housing, government subsidies to water and wastewater utilities amounted to more than 15 billion Egyptian pounds (USD 2.5bn) in 2009/10, including EP 13.4bn (USD 2.2bn) <b>investment</b> <b>subsidies,</b> EP 0.66 bn (USD 0.1bn) operating subsidies and EP 1 bn (USD 0.2bn) repair and rehabilitation subsidies.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the net benefit accruing to a present-biased government contemplating {{the option of}} speeding up investment setting a lower tax rate on future profits or an <b>investment</b> <b>subsidy</b> as an incentive. The literature generally suggests {{the use of an}} <b>investment</b> <b>subsidy</b> rather than a reduced tax rate. However, this study shows that, depending on the degree of present-biasedness, it may be more advantageous for the government to set a lower tax rate. The government, in fact, when selecting the instrument to be used for speeding up investment, trades off the immediate and certain cost of a subsidy against the random tax revenues accruing from the investment. Hence, from the short-sighted perspective of current government, a lower tax rate may appear optimal as long as the consideration given to the earnings of future governments is small and/or the current government’s duration is short...|$|R

40|$|Improved energy {{efficiency}} and greenhouse gas mitigation could be achieved by replacing resistance heaters with district heating system. In 2005, only about 8 % of the Swedish detached houses had district heating system. The expansion of such systems largely depends on homeowners' adoption decisions. And, to motivate homeowners to adopt district heating, {{it is essential to}} understand their decision-making process. In this context, in June 2005 we carried out a questionnaire survey of about 700 homeowners who lived in the city of Östersund in houses with resistance heaters (baseline survey). About 84 % of the respondents did not intend to install a new heating system. Since then these homeowners were influenced by (a) an <b>investment</b> <b>subsidy</b> by the Swedish government to replace resistance heaters with district heating, a brine/water-based heat pump, or a biomass-based heating system and (b) a marketing campaign by the municipality-owned district heating company. This paper analyses how these two measures influenced about 78 % of the homeowners to adopt the district heating system. For this purpose we carried out a follow-up survey of the same homeowners in December 2006 (resurvey). Results showed that the <b>investment</b> <b>subsidy</b> and the marketing campaign created a need among the homeowners to adopt a new heating system. The marketing campaign was successful in motivating them to adopt the district heating system. The marketing strategy by the district heating company corresponds to the results obtained in the baseline survey.

40|$|Welfare {{ranking of}} policy {{instruments}} is {{addressed in a}} two-sector Ramsey model with monopoly pricing in one sector as the only distortion. When government spending is restricted, i. e. when a government is {{unable or unwilling to}} finance the required costs for implementing the optimum policy, subsidies that directly affect investment incentives may generate higher welfare effects than the direct instrument, which is a production subsidy. The driving mechanism is that an <b>investment</b> <b>subsidy</b> may be more cost effective than the direct instrument; and that the relative welfare gain from cost effectiveness can exceed the welfare loss from introducing new distortions. Moreover, it is found that the <b>investment</b> <b>subsidy</b> is gradually phased out of the welfare maximizing policy, which may be a policy combining the two subsidies, when the level of government spending is increased.
