40|$|The feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> is {{the widest}} spread {{instrument}} {{used to promote}} electricity generation from renewable energy sources in the EU, with the costs of resources devoted to this promotion usually being borne by final consumers. Two components of the electricity retail price {{are expected to be}} influenced by the feed-in tariff regulation: the incentive to those firmsproducing electricity fromrenewable energy sources and thewholesale price of electricity. In this studywe analyze the effects that the feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> has on the electricity retail price for industrial consumers. Weestimate the relative intensity {{of the impact of the}} cost of support electricity generation under the feed-in tariff and the electricity wholesale price on the Spanish industrial retail price. Special attention is devoted to technology-specific considerations, as well as short and long run effects. The results show that there is not a strong link between the retail and wholesale market for Spanish industrial consumers. Moreover, the results indicate that an increase of solar generation leads to a higher increase in the industrial retail price than in the case of a proportional increase of wind generation. This suggests that, when evaluating the feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> impact on the retail price, the cost of incentives effect prevails over the wholesale price effect, and this is stronger for solar than for wind generation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” Under the {{enhanced}} single buyer model of electricity supply industry in Thailand, <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> {{is needed to}} prevent unfair pricing for consumers. Retail electricity tariff, being separated into base tariff and automatic tariff adjustment mechanism, has been regulated by multiple regulatory bodies. Findings reveal that Thai electricity base <b>tariff</b> <b>regulations</b> tended to favor electric utilities rather than consumers, basing on rate of return regulatory approach. In addition, the automatic tariff adjustment mechanism attached greater importance to operators than to the consumers, enabling the former to fully pass the fuel and power purchase burdens through to the consumers. The results of adoption of current regulatory regime are excess capacity in electricity supply industry and excessive profits for electric utilities. This paper, thus, proposed tariff regulatory alternatives that could enhance efficiency of operators while simultaneously sharing these benefits with consumers...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine empirically the impact of {{privatization}} on water access and affordability in Malaysia using household expenditure data. The development of water sector in Malaysia in terms of coverage has been fairly uneven. Some states have privatized their water supply sector while others have not. The overall finding of this study is that the impact of privatization on access and affordability in the Malaysian water supply sector is ambiguous. Privatization does not seem to have improved access to treated water from network in Malaysia. A likely explanation of this is the role played by the government in the sector in terms of <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> and universal service provision. Furthermore, privatization does not seem to have adversely affected affordability in the sector. In addition to political intervention in <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation,</b> this could be due to the government maintaining a significant stake in privatized water companies.

40|$|The Energy Market Inspectorate is {{implementing}} a new <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> in Sweden. A {{small part of}} the new regulation concerns effectible operation costs and originally they where intended to be calculated using a modification of equivalent comparison standards, in Swedish Ekm. This thesis is intended to analyze if Fortums grid in Stockholm could be described correctly, using equivalent comparison standards. In Ekm every part of the distribution grid is designated a weighting in relation to 1 km 0. 4 kV over head line. These Ekm-measurements are intended to simplify comparison between different grid areas with different structure and geographical conditions. The goal of this report is to asses Ekmmeasurements suitability for calculating DSOs effectible operation costs. During the work on this report, the Energy Market Inspectorate decide not to use Ekm during the first four year regulatory period. The focus therefor changed to increase Fortums knowledge about Ekm-measurements for preparation purposes. This report includes a short introduction to the problem at hand, as well as underlying theory about power distribution and the new <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation.</b> A description of gathered data, calculations and analysis of data follows. The result is presented as a selection of Fortum specific Ekm-measurements for both operation and maintenance cost as well as customer related costs. Existing Ekm-measurements where found to be unreliable. In the later part of the report the results are discussed and the conclusion is drawn. Existing Ekm-measurements are not suitable to describe the grid in Stockholm. However it {{can not be ruled out}} that a modified version of the measurements could render better values in the new <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation.</b> Because of this conclusion further studies are desired. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates how {{upcoming}} {{changes in}} the Swedish <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> could affect distribution system operators (DSOs), with focus on reinvestment planning. This is done by general analyses {{as well as by}} authentic calculation examples of a real power distribution system. The paper describes the Swedish <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> with expected changes, provides a summary of changes in Swedish laws and regulation affecting DSOs between 1996 and 2016, describes how a DSO at local distribution level conduct their reinvestments, illustrates economic calculation examples and finally presents analyses and conclude the results. Analysis results presented show that the outcome from the regulation is sensitive towards relatively small changes in WACC and age structure. The tariff cap allowed will however be significantly reduced for all tested scenarios. A reinvestment rate of in average~ 10 % regarding meters and IT and ~ 2. 5 % regarding all other categories could be a rough guideline to meet the new incentives, but that could differ depending on the actual age structure of the DSO.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} two {{effects of}} the current Dutch regulation on the system operators of the electricity network and on teh decentralised generators of electricity, and suggests a number of improvements in the <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation.</b> The increase in the distributed generation of electricity, with wind turbines and solar panels, necessitates investments in the distribution network. The current <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> in the Dutch electricity industry, with its ex post evaluation of the efficiency of investments and the frontier shift in the x-factor, delays these investments. In the unbundled electricity industry, the investments in the network need to be coordinated {{with those in the}} distributed generation of electricity to enable the DSOs to build enough network capacity. The current Dutch regulations do not provide for a sufficient information exchange between the generators and the system operators to coordinate the investments. This paper analyses these two {{effects of the}} Dutch regulation, and suggests improvements to the regulation of the network connection and transportation tariffs to allow for sufficient network capacity and coordination between the investments in the network and in the generation of electricity. These improvements include locally differentiated tariffs that increase with an increasing concentration of distributed generators. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”Regulatory {{benchmarking}} {{is becoming}} a frequently used tool in <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> of public utilities, including natural gas distribution companies. One of the possible approaches is based on total factor productivity (TFP) benchmarking. However, regulatory agencies {{do not have a}} great deal of experience in this field and the benefits of this regulatory regime are not clear-cut. The article starts with the discussion of principles of incentive regulation and total factor productivity measurement. Then, the international experience with TFP benchmarking and possible weaknesses of the TFP approach have been discussed. Further, the authors determined the productivity development of the Czech regional gas distribution companies in the period 2001 - 2011 using Fisher index and partial factor productivity analysis. Finally, the authors summarized the assumptions and measures which should be taken in order to apply TFP benchmarking in practice. The authors do not recommend using TFP-based tariff setting in the Czech Republic, nor in other post-communist countries. In particular, it has been shown that the events which took place in the period under consideration resulted in a distortion of available data which disallow their efficient use in <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> at the present time and in the near future. The authors suggest using the TFP approach rather as an underlying method for further analysis and tariff setting...|$|R
