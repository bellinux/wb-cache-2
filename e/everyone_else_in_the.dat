5|$|The {{selection}} of Leech and Morgan for the 6 December final generated controversy, {{as they were}} the two youngest swimmers in the squad and lacked experience at open level competition. Both had competed only once at senior Australian level; Morgan had twice false started at the 1956 Australian Championships, while Leech had been too ill to compete. Australia was the favourite for the relay, having swept the medals in the individual 100-metre event; Fraser, Crapp and Leech finished first, second and third. The favouritism was even more marked because Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster than <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E
5|$|Andy (Ed Helms) {{still has}} not learned about fiancee Angela's (Angela Kinsey) affair with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), {{seventeen}} days after Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) revealed it to <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dunder Mifflin office. Michael (Steve Carell) suggests he should inform Andy, but the entire office argues that Angela {{should be the one}} to break the news. Jim (John Krasinski) is particularly concerned that Andy's past anger management issues may lead to violence. Dwight tries convincing Angela to tell Andy, but she continues to put it off. This leaves Michael to tell Andy before he leaves for a meeting with David Wallace (Andy Buckley). Michael reveals the affair to Andy while driving out of the parking lot, leaving Andy shocked and dismayed. Angela reluctantly confirms the affair occurred, and Andy realizes everybody else in the office already knew about it.|$|E

5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to assassinate President Dale, the Martians invade Earth, {{starting}} with Washington, D.C. As they attack the White House (and incinerate the White House tour guide), the Secret Service evacuates the President, but the First Lady Marsha is crushed to death by the Nancy Reagan chandelier. Taffy vanishes during the chaos. After the U.S. government unsuccessfully attempts a nuclear attack on the mother ship, the Martians expand their invasion {{to the rest of}} Earth, defacing world landmarks for their own amusement as they do so. That night, the Martians breach the bunker where Dale has been taken and the leader reduces Decker to the size of an insect before killing him. The Martians kill <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bunker except for Dale, who makes an impassioned speech in an attempt to plea for peace and his life. The Martians seem convinced, but then use a false hand to kill the President.|$|E
5|$|In May 1809, {{the rebels}} {{captured}} Sjenica. They repulsed an Ottoman {{attack on the}} village of Suvodol in early June, and seized Novi Pazar later that month, but failed to take its fortress. Lacking numbers and adequate military training, they failed to establish a corridor to Montenegro and never came close to the Adriatic Sea. Karađorđe had described acquiring access to the sea {{as one of his}} key aims. The rebels experienced further setbacks in Niš, where 3,000 were surrounded at Čegar Hill in May–June 1809. Knowing that he and his men would be impaled if captured, rebel commander Stevan Sinđelić fired at his entrenchment's gun powder magazine, setting off a massive explosion that killed him and <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity. On the site of the battle, the Ottoman commander Hurshid Pasha built a stone tower with the skulls of Sinđelić and his fighters embedded in its walls as a warning to others who wished to rebel.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Empire {{was known}} to create tower {{structures}} from the skulls of rebel fighters in order to elicit terror among its opponents. The First Serbian Uprising against Ottoman rule erupted in February 1804, with Đorđe Petrović (Karađorđe) as its leader. On 19 May 1809, 3,000 Serbian rebels {{under the command of}} Stevan Sinđelić were attacked by the Ottomans on Čegar Hill, in Niš. The rebels were plagued by lack of coordination, largely due to the rivalry between commanders Milivoje Petrovic and Petar Dobrnjac. As a result, Sinđelić's fighters failed to receive support from the other rebel detachments. The numerically superior Ottomans lost thousands of soldiers in a number of failed attacks against the rebels, but eventually overwhelmed the Serbian lines. Knowing that he and his men would be impaled if captured, Sinđelić fired at his entrenchment's gun powder magazine, setting off a massive explosion. The resulting blast killed him and <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity.|$|E

After collecting some supplies, {{the three of them}} leave the town and make it to the facility where Rei originally woke up, which still has some electricity. Tipi gives Rei access to an electronic library on a tablet shortly before her battery is no longer able to function. Rei and Shiona stay in the facility for a time until Shiona eventually succumbs to the gunshot wound which had damaged her internal components. Rei puts Shiona and Tipi in cryogenic pods before leaving with the music box in an attempt to find a world where humans and Phiroids can coexist. Sometime later, Shiona wakes up in a facility with her memories wiped, but she is told that there was a music box with her when she was found. The environment has recovered and human civilization is once again prosperous and highly technological. Shiona is taken back to the town where humans and Phiroids once again coexist. She is reunited with Tipi, who also had her memories wiped. Prompted by the tune playing from the music box, Shiona sings the song which is now known worldwide.|$|E

25|$|With {{the changes}} taking place on Britain's {{railways}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, the outlook changed for preserved diesel locomotives. In British Rail days no privately owned diesel locomotives were allowed to operate on its tracks.

Suddenly, the owners of preserved locomotives were on an equal footing with <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b> <b>In</b> fact, <b>the</b> characteristics of the Deltic locomotives, powerful and capable of cruising at , enabled them to fit more easily onto the modern rail network than other, slower, preserved diesels.|$|R

Those families, along with <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military, were known as Lokar.

25|$|John Duff {{was born}} in China in 1895. Like <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British Empire, Canadians were {{subjects}} of the reigning monarch, not citizens of any country. If there had been Canadian citizenship, Duff would have qualified via his Canadian parents. John Duff {{can be found on}} the Canadian Census for both 1901 and 1911. There was a category for “Nationality”. In both cases, Duff’s was listed as Canadian. When John Duff started racing in 1920, he had lived a significant part of his life in Canada. Although there was no Canadian citizenship until 1947, Canada had issued its own passports since the 1860s. As late as 1932, John Duff carried a Canadian passport — which means that he carried one throughout his racing career. In a newspaper interview given after his last crash, Duff was clear about his Canadian origins. Finally, and most conclusively, John Duff’s eldest son and daughter have no doubt that their father was a Canadian.|$|E
