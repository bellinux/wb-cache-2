50|$|Exposure {{to social}} stress in {{childhood}} {{can also have}} long-term effects, increasing risk for <b>developing</b> <b>diseases</b> later in life. In particular, adults who were maltreated (emotionally, physically, sexually abused or neglected) as children report more disease outcomes, such as stroke, heart attack, diabetes, and hypertension or greater severity of those outcomes. The Adverse Childhood Experiences study (ACE), which includes over seventeen thousand adults, also {{found that there was}} a 20% increase in likelihood for experiencing heart disease for each kind of chronic familial social stressor experienced in childhood, and this was not due to typical risk factors for heart disease such as demographics, smoking, exercise, adiposity, diabetes, or hypertension.|$|E
50|$|Many African Americans are {{descendants}} {{of people of}} West African nations and consequently, also have a high prevalence of APOL1 risk alleles as well as APOL1 associated kidney diseases. The frequency of the risk alleles in African Americans is more than 30%. The existence of these alleles {{has been shown to}} increase the risk of <b>developing</b> <b>diseases</b> such as Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis(FSGS), Hypertension Attributed-End Stage Kidney Disease, and HIV-Associated Nephropathy(HIVAN). The prevalence of the risk alleles in African Americans with these kidney diseases shown in recent studies are 67% in HIVAN, 66% in FSGS, and 47% in hypertension-attributed ESKD. Studies have also determined the prevalence of each individual allele in FSGS cases as well. The prevalence of the G1 risk allele in African Americans with FSGS is 52% and 18-23% in those without FSGS. The prevalence of the G2 risk allele in African Americans with FSGS is 23% and 15% in those without FSGS. Hispanic populations such as Dominicans and Puerto Ricans demonstrate a mixture of genetic influences that include African ancestry resulting in a prevalence of the APOL1 variants as well.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Developing early {{detection}} biosensors for disease {{has been the}} long‒held goal of the Human Genome Project, but with little success. Conversely, the biological properties of the mitochondrion coupled with the relative simplicity of the mitochondrial genome give this organelle extraordinary functionality as a biosensor and places the field of mitochondrial genomics {{in a position of}} strategic advantage to launch significant advances in personalized medicine. Numerous factors make the mitochondrion organelle uniquely suited to be an {{early detection}} biosensor with applications in oncology as well as many other aspects of human health and disease. Early detection of disease translates into more effective, less expensive treatments for disease and overall better prognoses for those at greater risk for <b>developing</b> <b>diseases.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|Gestational {{diabetes}} mellitus {{is defined by}} new-onset glucose intolerance during pregnancy. About 2 – 5 % of all pregnant women develop gestational diabetes during their pregnancies and the prevalence has increased considerably during the last decade. This metabolic condition is manifested when pancreatic β-cells lose their ability to compensate for increased insulin resistance during pregnancy, however, the pathogenesis of the disease remains largely unknown. Gestational diabetes is strongly associated with adverse pregnancy outcome {{as well as with}} long-term adverse effects on the offspring which likely occurs due to epigenetic modifications of the fetal genome. In the current review we address gestational diabetes and the short and long term complications for both mothers and offspring focusing on the importance of fetal programming in conferring risk of <b>developing</b> <b>diseases</b> in adulthood...|$|E
40|$|People with {{disability}} {{may be at}} risk of <b>developing</b> <b>diseases</b> due {{to physical}} inactivity; social support from family and friends is positively related to engaging in regular physical activity.

We used multivariate logistical regression to analyze 2009 Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data (n = 10, 902) to assess differences in physical activity in disability levels for respondents who lived alone versus those who did not. Respondents with a disability were less likely to engage in physical activity than were people without a disability, regardless of disability type, and the lowest rates of engaging in physical activity were found for people with disability who lived alone. Public health efforts should consider the role of household composition when targeting physical activity interventions among people with disability...|$|E
40|$|The {{nutritional}} environment during embryonic, fetal and neonatal development plays {{a crucial}} role in the offspring’s risk of <b>developing</b> <b>diseases</b> later in life. Although non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) provide sweet taste without contributing to energy intake, animal studies showed that long-term consumption of NSS, particularly aspartame, starting during the perigestational period may predispose the offspring to develop obesity and metabolic syndrome later in life. In this paper, we review the impact of NNS exposure during the perigestational period on the long-term disease risk of the offspring, with a particular focus on metabolic diseases. Some mechanisms underlying NNS adverse metabolic effects have been proposed, such as an increase in intestinal glucose absorption, alterations in intestinal microbiota, induction of oxidative stress and a dysregulation of appetite and reward responses. The data reviewed herein suggest that NNS consumption by pregnant and lactating women should be looked with particular caution and requires further research...|$|E

40|$|On a {{data set}} of 12 {{endocrine}} variables in blood {{from a small}} number of clinically healthy adult women studied with systematically-placed samples around the clock and the seasons, pattern discrimination methods had singled out certain hormone values in certain seasons as classifiers for a high vs. low risk of <b>developing</b> <b>diseases</b> associated with a high blood pressure. Further evidence in support of such classifiers was obtained, first, by increasing the number of series from 1 to 3 age groups and, second, by extending the scope of the data on any one age group by bootstrapping. Classifier roles were strongly supported for plasma aldosterone and TSH originally by an analysis of variance and, in the case of aldosterone, by circannual cosinor analysis, {{as well as by the}} analysis of added data and by bootstrapping. Identification of classifiers provides cost-effective endocrine checks complementing the targetted automatic monitoring of blood pressure as part of a system of chrono-engineering for health maintenance...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the lymphocyte immunophenotype in an elderly population. METHODS: This study enrolled 35 over 60 -year-old volunteers and a control group composed of 35 young adults. The study included elderly without diseases that might affect {{the functioning of the}} immune system. These individuals were consulted by doctors and after a physical examination, laboratory tests were performed using a Beckman Coulter (r) flow cytometer. The GraphPad Prism computer program was employed for statistical analysis with the level of significance being set for p-values < 0. 05. RESULTS: There is a statistically significant {{reduction in the number of}} lymphocytes (CD 8 +, CD 2 + and CD 3 + cells) in the elderly compared to young adults. These low rates are explained by changes attributed to aging and may be partly responsible for the reduction in the cellular immune response, lower proliferative activity and the low cytotoxicity of lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: These parameters showed greater impairment of adaptive immunity in the elderly population and can therefore explain the greater fragility of the aged body to <b>developing</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|E
