50|$|Reproductive {{toxicity}} is {{a hazard}} associated with some chemical substances, {{that they will}} interfere in some way with normal reproduction; such substances are called reprotoxic. It includes adverse effects on sexual function and fertility in adult males and females, as well as developmental toxicity in the offspring. It is usual to take a practical definition, including several different effects which are unrelated to each other except in their outcome of lowered effective fertility. The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) separates reproductive toxicity from <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutagenicity</b> and carcinogenicity, even though both these hazards may also affect fertility.|$|E

It has proved difficult to obtain highly purified primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> for preparation of a specific antibody. In the present study, a new method for purifying mouse primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> was developed using a Nycodenz gradient. Furthermore, the polyclonal anti-mouse primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> IgG derived from mouse primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> was prepared.

This new method represents a significant improvement in the purification of primordial germ cells; it is simpler than previous methods, and produced mouse primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> with a purity of more than 95 %. In addition, the separation reagent Nycodenz is non-toxic and achieved separation of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> without attachment of antibodies against the primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> membrane surface.

40|$|Type II <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors arise after puberty from a <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> {{that was}} {{incorrectly}} programmed during fetal life. Failure of testicular <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> to properly differentiate {{can lead to}} the formation of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia in situ of the testis; this precursor cell invariably gives rise to <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> cancer after puberty. The Nodal co-receptor Cripto is expressed transiently during normal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development and is ectopically expressed in non-seminomas that arise from <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia in situ, suggesting that its aberrant expression may underlie <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> dysregulation and hence <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> cancer. Here we investigated methylation of the Cripto promoter in mouse <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and human <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> cancer and correlated this with the level of CRIPTO protein expression. We found hypomethylation of the CRIPTO promoter in undifferentiated fetal <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> embryonal carcinoma and seminomas, but hypermethylation in differentiated fetal <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and the differentiated types of non-seminomas. CRIPTO protein was strongly expressed in <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia in situ along with embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor and seminomas. Further, cleaved CRIPTO was detected in media from seminoma and embryonal carcinoma cell lines, suggesting that cleaved CRIPTO may provide diagnostic indication of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> cancer. Accordingly, CRIPTO was detectable in serum from 6 / 15 patients with embryonal carcinoma, 5 / 15 patients with seminoma, 4 / 5 patients with <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia in situ cells only and in 1 / 15 control patients. These findings suggest that CRIPTO expression may be a useful serological marker for diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes during <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> cancer management.

The reproductive potential of populations can be affected by alterations in the fecundity and offspring viability caused by germ cell mutations. Despite the ecological relevance of these effects, there are few studies on <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutagenicity</b> in natural populations. Biomphalaria glabrata was chosen for this study because of the scarcity of data on freshwater invertebrates and the ecological importance of this group. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish a <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutagenicity</b> test in B. glabrata by using a similar approach to that used in the dominant lethal test in rodents. Mitomycin C was used as a direct mutagen and cyclophosphamide as a mutagen that requires metabolic activation. Wild-type snails were exposed for 10 days to three concentrations of each agent and crossed with non-exposed albino snails at the end of the treatment. The total frequencies of malformations were analyzed in the offspring of wild-type snails; among the offspring of albino snails, only the heterozygous wild-type embryos were analyzed for malformations. Both agents induced germ cell mutations. The analysis of the offspring of the wild-type snails showed an effect of the exposure up to approximately 5 days after the end of the treatment with cyclophosphamide; the effect of mitomycin C was observed until 45 days after the end of the exposure. There was an increase in the frequencies of malformations in the wild-type offspring of the non-exposed albino snails crossed with the wild-type snails exposed to both agents.

40|$|This {{workshop}} {{reviewed the}} current science to inform and recommend the best evidence-based approaches {{on the use}} of germ cell genotoxicity tests. The workshop questions and key outcomes were as follows. (1) Do genotoxicity and mutagenicity assays in somatic cells predict germ cell effects? Limited data suggest that somatic cell tests detect most germ cell mutagens, but there are strong concerns that dictate caution in drawing conclusions. (2) Should germ cell tests be done, and when? If there is evidence that a chemical or its metabolite(s) will not reach target germ cells or gonadal tissue, {{it is not necessary to}} conduct germ cell tests, notwithstanding somatic outcomes. However, it was recommended that negative somatic cell mutagens with clear evidence for gonadal exposure and evidence of toxicity in germ cells could be considered for <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutagenicity</b> testing. For somatic mutagens that are known to reach the gonadal compartments and expose germ cells, the chemical could be assumed to be a germ cell mutagen without further testing. Nevertheless, <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutagenicity</b> testing would be needed for quantitative risk assessment. (3) What new assays should be implemented and how? There is an immediate need for research on the application of whole genome sequencing in heritable mutation analysis in humans and animals, and integration of germ cell assays with somatic cell genotoxicity tests. Focus should be on environmental exposures that can cause de novo mutations, particularly newly recognized types of genomic changes. Mutational events, which may occur by exposure of germ cells during embryonic development, should also be investigated. Finally, where there are indications of germ cell toxicity in repeat dose or reproductive toxicology tests, consideration should be given to leveraging those studies to inform of possible germ cell genotoxicity.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we show that mouse {{primordial}} <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and fetal <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> at certain stages of differentiation express E-cadherin and α and β catenins. Moreover, we demonstrate that the formation of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> aggregates that rapidly occurs when monodispersed <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> populations are released from embryonic gonads in culture is E-cadherin mediated, developmentally regulated, and dependent on {{the sex of the}} <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> Immunoblotting analyses indicate that the lower ability to form aggregates of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in comparison to fetal <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> is not due to gross changes in E-cadherin expression, altered association with β catenin, or changes in β catenin phosphorylation. Investigating possible functions of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion in primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development, we found that E-cadherin-mediated adhesion may stimulate the motility of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> Moreover, treatment of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> cultured on STO cell monolayers with an anti-E-cadherin antibody caused a significant decrease in their number and markedly reduced their ability to form colonies in vitro. The same in vitro treatment of explanted undifferentiated gonadal ridges cultured for 4 days results in decreased numbers and altered localization of the <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> inside the gonads. Taken together these results suggest that E-cadherin {{plays an important role in}} primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> migration and homing and may act as a modulator of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development...|$|R

Approximately 50 % of the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> that form reach their target. The errant cells within the embryo undergo developmentally regulated cell death. Prior studies have identified some autosomal genes that regulate <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> migration, but the genes that control <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> death are not known. To identify X-linked genes required for <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> migration and/or death, we performed a screen for mutations that disrupt these processes.

By tracing GFP-labeled <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo and analyzing the germ cell-depleted mutant, zenzai, we show that the proliferation and differentiation of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are regulated in a sexually dimorphic manner in the teleost fish medaka. In the undifferentiated gonads, <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> resume proliferation by slow intermittent division (type I), producing isolated daughter <b>cells.</b> While <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in the male gonads continue this mode of proliferation, some <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> fractions in the female gonads initiate two to four rounds of continuous division (type II), forming cysts of four, eight, or sixteen cells, which subsequently enter meiosis synchronously. Thus, female <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> become differentiated much earlier than do male <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> In the zenzai mutant, a defect in slow intermittent division eventually leads to the depletion of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in the adult gonads in both sexes, {{despite the fact that}} cyst-forming division is unaffected. This argues that slow intermittent division is essential for the maintenance of <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> The proliferation and differentiation of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are thus important components of gonadal sex differentiation in vertebrates...|$|R

40|$|In Drosophila, {{the sex of}} <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> is {{determined}} by cell-autonomous and inductive signals.

In contrast, XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> non-autonomously become spermatogenic when developing in a male host. In first instar larvae with two X chromosomes, XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> enter the female or the male pathway depending on {{the presence or absence}} of transformer (tra) activity in the surrounding soma. In somatic cells, the product of tra regulates the expression of the gene double sex (dsx) which can form a male-specific or a female-specific product. In dsx mutant larvae, XX and XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> develop abnormally, with a seemingly intersexual phenotype. This indicates that female-specific somatic dsx products feminize XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> and male-specific somatic dsx products masculinize XX and XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> The results show that tra and dsx control early inductive signals that determine the sex of XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and that somatic signals also affect the development of XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> that develop in pseudomales lacking the sex-determining function of Sxl are spermatogenic. If, however, female-specific tra functions are expressed in these animals, XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> become oogenic.

We further describe how the detection of mutations in the transgene recovered from germ cells can be used to characterize the stage-specific sensitivity of the various spermatogenic cell types to mutagen exposure by controlling three experimental parameters: the duration of exposure (administration time), the time between exposure and sample collection (sampling time), and the cell population collected for analysis.

From 5 to 30 wk of age, genetically intact male C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice were fed a normal diet or one in which 60 % of the kilocalories were from lard. Obese mice exhibited significant differences in the mRNA of several genes within the testes in comparison to lean males. Pparg was increased 2. 2 -fold, whereas Crem, Sh 2 b 1, Dhh, Igf 1, and Lepr were decreased 6. 7, 1. 4, 3. 2, 1. 6, and 7. 2 -fold, respectively. The fertility of male mice was compared through mating with control females. Acrylamide (AA) -induced reproductive toxicity was assessed in obese or lean males treated with water or 25 mg AA kg− 1 day− 1 via gavage for 5 days and then mated to control females. Percent body fat and weight were significantly increased in mice fed a high-fat vs. a normal diet. Obesity resulted in significant reduction in plugs and pregnancies of control females partnered with obese vs. lean males. Serum leptin and insulin levels were each approximately 5 -fold higher in obese vs. age-matched lean mice. Sperm from obese males exhibited decreased motility and reduced hyperactivated progression vs. lean mice. Treatment with AA exacerbated male infertility of obese and lean mice; however, this effect was more pronounced in obese mice. Further, females partnered with AA-treated obese mice exhibited a further decrease in the percentage of live fetuses, whereas the percentage of resorptions increased. This work demonstrated that diet-induced obesity in mice caused a significant reduction in male fertility and exacerbated AA-induced reproductive toxicity and <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutagenicity...</b>|$|E

The glycoconjugate is expressed by primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> {{throughout the entire}} migration process, {{but it is no}} longer detectable in late intragonadal primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> These data suggest that the a-N-acetylgalactosamine-containing glycoconjugates in the nucleus of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> may play a functional role in primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> protection against differentiation during the migration process. The temporal correlation between disappearance of nuclear Dolichos biflorus agglutinin positivity and colonisation of the gonadal ridges, may be explained by a change in the functional status of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> nuclear glycoconjugates in relation with the onset of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> {{development}} uses programmed {{cell death}} to remove abnormal, misplaced or excess cells. Precise control {{of this process is}} essential to maintain the continuity and integrity of the germline, and to prevent <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> from colonizing locations other than the gonads. Through careful analyses of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> distribution in developing Drosophila melanogaster embryos, we show that normal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development involves extensive {{programmed cell death}} during stages 10 - 12 of embryogenesis. This <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> death is mediated by Drosophila p 53 (p 53). Mutations in p 53 result in excess primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> that are ectopic to the gonads. Initial movements of the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> appear normal, and wild-type numbers of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> populate the gonads, indicating that p 53 is required for <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> death, but not migration. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a loss-of-function phenotype for Drosophila p 53 in a non-sensitized background. The p 53 phenotype is remarkably similar to that of outsiders (out) mutants. Here, we show that the out gene encodes a putative monocarboxylate transporter. Mutations in p 53 and out show nonallelic noncomplementation. Interestingly, overexpression of p 53 in primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> of out mutant embryos partially suppresses the out <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> death phenotype, suggesting that p 53 functions in <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> either downstream of out or in a closely linked pathway. These findings inform models in which signaling between p 53 and cellular metabolism are integrated to regulate programmed cell death decisions...|$|R
40|$|Characteristically, {{bandicoot}} primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are large, lightly staining {{cells with}} vesicular nuclei {{in which the}} chromatin is clumped beneath the nuclear envelope. Rounded, lightly staining cells in the yolk sac wall of 9 1 / 2 days old embryos are tentatively identified as primordial germ cells; as they lack other primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> attributes {{it is suggested that}} they may be prospective primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in the process of differentiation. The primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> reach the prominent gonadal rudiments by migration through the hindgut and dorsal mesentery, as in eutherian mammals. In 9 1 / 2 days old embryos the primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are found in the hindgut endoderm and mesoderm. By day 11 they are migrating in the dorsal mesentery. During migration the primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> undergo both division and attrition. Primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> reach the gonadal ridges around the perinatal period. No sexual differences are evident at this stage. As the gonadal ridges develop before the primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> reach their vicinity their development is clearly independent of the primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagens are {{currently}} classified {{into three categories}} in the German List of MAK- and BAT-Values. These categories have been revised and extended in analogy to the new categories for carcinogenic chemicals. <b>Germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagens produce heritable gene mutations, and heritable structural and numerical chromosome aberrations in <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> The original categories 1 and 2 for <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagens remained unchanged. Two new categories 3 A and 3 B are proposed for chemicals which are suspected to be <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagens. A new category 5 is proposed for <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagens with low potency which contribute negligibly to human genetic risk provided the MAK value is observed. The following categories are presented for further discussion. 1. <b>Germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagens which {{have been shown to}} increase the mutant frequency among the progeny of exposed humans. 2. <b>Germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagens which have been shown to increase the mutant frequency among the progeny of exposed animals. 3 A. Substances which have been shown to induce genetic damage in <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> of humans or animals, or which are mutagenic in somatic cells and have been shown to reach the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in their active forms. 3 B.

40|$|Steel factor, {{the protein}} {{product of the}} Steel locus in the mouse, is a {{multifunctional}} signal for the primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> population. We have shown previously that its expression accompanies the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> during migration to the gonads, forming a "travelling niche" that controls their survival, motility, and proliferation. Here we show that these functions are distributed between the alternatively spliced membrane-bound and soluble forms of Steel factor. The <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> normally migrate as individuals from E 7. 5 to E 11. 5, when they aggregate together in the embryonic gonads. Movie analysis of Steel-dickie mutant embryos, which make only the soluble form, at E 7. 5, showed that the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> fail to migrate normally, and undergo "premature aggregation" {{in the base of}} the allantois. Survival and directionality of movement is not affected. Addition of excess soluble Steel factor to Steel-dickie embryos rescued <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> motility, and addition of Steel factor to <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro showed that a fourfold higher dose was required to increase motility, compared to survival. These data show that soluble Steel factor is sufficient for <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> survival, and suggest that the membrane-bound form provides a higher local concentration of Steel factor that controls the balance between <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> motility and aggregation. This hypothesis was tested by addition of excess soluble Steel factor to slice cultures of E 11. 5 embryos, when migration usually ceases, and the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> aggregate. This reversed the aggregation process, and caused increased motility of the <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> We conclude that the two forms of Steel factor control different aspects of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> behavior, and that membrane-bound Steel factor controls <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> motility within a "motility niche" that moves through the embryo with the <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> Escape from this niche causes cessation of motility and death by apoptosis of the ectopic <b>germ</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
