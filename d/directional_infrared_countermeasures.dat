50|$|DIRCM, or <b>Directional</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Countermeasures,</b> {{avoid this}} {{potential}} drawback by mounting the energy source on a movable turret (much like a FLIR turret). They only operate when cued by a missile warning system of a missile launch, {{and use the}} missile plume to accurately aim at the missile seeker. The modulated signal can then be directed at the seeker, and the modulation scheme can be cycled to try to defeat a variety of seekers. Countermeasure success depends on a threat's tracking techniques and requires a proper analysis of the missile's capabilities. Defeating advanced tracking systems requires {{a higher level of}} DIRCM power. Issues of Laser Safety are also taken into account.|$|E
50|$|A {{more modern}} {{laser-based}} technique removes the scanning and instead uses some {{other form of}} detection to identify the missile and aim the laser directly at it. This blinds the seeker continually, and is useful against even modern imaging seekers. These <b>directional</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>countermeasures</b> (DIRCMs) are very effective, they are also very expensive and generally only suitable for aircraft that are not maneuvering, like cargo aircraft and helicopters. Their implementation is further complicated by placing filters {{in front of the}} imager to remove any off-frequency signals, requiring the laser to tune itself to the frequency of the seeker or sweep through a range. Some work has even been put into systems with enough power to optically damage the nose cone or filters within the missile, but this remains beyond {{the current state of the}} art.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, EADS {{announced}} several enhancements to {{the base}} C-295 design, changes included the adoption of winglets {{and an ability to}} carry the Marte anti-ship missile; a dedicated airborne early warning and control variant was also planned. In November 2015, a C-295 successfully demonstrated a new self-protection suite, which incorporated elements such as <b>directional</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>countermeasures</b> from Elbit Systems and infrared passive airborne warning system. In January 2016, Airbus {{was in the process of}} developing a new hose-and-drogue in-flight refuelling rig to be optionally installed in the centerline of the C295, this capability is being promoted for the aerial refuelling of combat helicopters, initial 'dry' flight tests are scheduled later in the year; Airbus is also performing flap optimisations and other modifications upon the type for extreme takeoff and vertical landing capabilities.|$|E
50|$|The CIRCM system, (along {{with the}} older LAIRCM and ATIRCM systems) provide a <b>directional</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>countermeasure,</b> which employs both threat-tracking capabilities, as well {{defensive}} measures employing modulating laser pulses to confuse missiles' guidance systems causing them to miss their target.|$|R
50|$|The AN/AAQ-24 {{system is}} a <b>directional</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>countermeasure</b> (DIRCM) system. It {{consists}} of a missile warning system (AN/AAR-54), an integration unit, a processor, and laser turrets (Small Laser Transmitter Assembly, SLTA). Early versions used an arc lamp to generate the jamming signal. Newer versions produced by Northrop Grumman use diode-based pump systems are known by the GUARDIAN name, and could be fitted to many commercial carriers {{in the near future}} pending the completion of many tests on the viability of such options.|$|R

50|$|Dr. McManamon was {{an early}} {{advocate}} of pro-active <b>Infrared</b> <b>countermeasures</b> recommending a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency program called medusa. The concept of pro-active IRCM has become prominent in the Air Force countermeasures community.|$|R

50|$|Advanced Threat <b>Infrared</b> <b>Countermeasures,</b> or ATIRCM, is {{the most}} recent attempt at an <b>infrared</b> <b>countermeasures</b> capability. The Army began fielding the ATIRCM Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) system on 83 CH-47s {{supporting}} operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2009. The USD(AT&L) limited the ATIRCM QRC program to these specific aircraft, due to the current combined weight of the ATIRCM/CMWS suite. DoD planners set the CIRCM target weight at 85 pounds for the jamming B-kit with two turrets, while the supporting A-kit is capped at 70 pounds for large rotorcraft like the Chinook and V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, or 35 pounds for smaller helicopters like the Black Hawk.|$|R
