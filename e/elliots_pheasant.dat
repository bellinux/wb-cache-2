50|$|<b>Elliot's</b> <b>{{pheasant}}</b> (Syrmaticus ellioti), {{is a large}} pheasant {{native to}} south-eastern China.|$|R
50|$|BirdLife International {{considers}} Wuyanling Reserve as an Important Bird Area (IBA). Birds {{of particular}} conservation {{value in the}} reserve include Cabot's tragopan, much studied in the reserve, and <b>Elliot's</b> <b>pheasant.</b>|$|R
50|$|Notable {{birds of}} the reserve include <b>Elliot's</b> <b>pheasant.</b> Mammals include clouded leopard, Asian black bear, Sumatran serow, and sika deer. The reserve hosts a {{population}} of hairy-fronted muntjacs estimated at 300-400 individuals.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife of {{the reserve}} include <b>Elliot's</b> <b>pheasant,</b> leopard, clouded leopard, Sumatran serow, and rhesus macaque. Presence of South China tiger faeces in the reserve has been {{confirmed}} with genetic methods. 2,203 species of insects have been recorded from the Baishanzu reserve.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Elliot's</b> <b>pheasant</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1872 by Robert Swinhoe, {{under the name}} [...] "Phasianus ellioti"; the type material was from Ningpo, Zhejiang province, China. The specific epithet [...] commemorates the American ornithologist Daniel Giraud Elliot; Swinhoe explained his choice thus: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Elliot's</b> <b>pheasant</b> is {{endemic to}} {{south-eastern}} China (Guizhou, Hubei, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces), where it lives in evergreen and mountain forests at altitudes of 200 - 1900 m. Its diet consists mainly of seeds, leaves and berries.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there is}} ongoing habitat loss, and the species has a limited range and is hunted for food, <b>Elliot's</b> <b>pheasant</b> is {{evaluated}} as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, {{as it does}} not appear to be declining appreciably in numbers. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.|$|R
25|$|The Pheasant Aviary {{is a long}} row of cages home to a large {{variety of}} bird species, {{particularly}} pheasants. Exhibited species include <b>Elliot's</b> <b>pheasant,</b> Lady Amherst's pheasant, Cabot's tragopan, blue eared-pheasant, mountain peacock-pheasant, Mérida helmeted curassow (Pauxi pauxi pauxi), Swinhoe's pheasant, eastern loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus migrans), white-throated ground-dove, Lord Derby's parakeet, Montezuma oropendola, and yellow-crested cockatoo. Across from the exhibit is a large pond for Chilean flamingos and coscoroba swans.|$|R
40|$|Maintaining genetic {{diversity}} {{is a major}} issue in conservation biology. In this study, we demonstrate the differences of {{genetic diversity}} levels between wild and captive individuals of <b>Elliot’s</b> <b>Pheasant</b> Syrmaticus ellioti. Wild individuals showed a higher genetic diversity level than that of the captive individuals. Nucleotide diversity and haplotype diversity of wild individuals were 0. 00628 and 0. 993, while those of captive individuals were 0. 00150 and 0. 584 respectively. Only 3 haplotypes of mtDNA control region sequence were identified among 36 captive individuals, while 16 unique haplotypes were identified among the 17 wild individuals in this study. One captive haplotype was shared by a wild individual from Anhui Province. It is concluded that a low number of founders was the likely reason for the lower level genetic diversity of the captive group. Careful genetic management is suggested for captive populations, particularly of such an endangered species, to maintain genetic variability levels...|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{the white}} wing-band was already present by that time; as the copper {{pheasant}} has a highly apomorphic coloration with reduced sexual dimorphism, {{it may well}} have lost such a trait after it settled Japan. But it might also have evolved only after the copper pheasant ancestors had split {{from those of the}} species displaying the wing-band today. However that may be, the minor plumage differences of the wing-banded species suggest that their last common ancestor looked almost identical to the living Mrs. Hume's pheasant (S. humiae). At some point during the Pliocene [...] - [...] probably around 2.8 mya during the Piacenzian [...] - [...] the ancestors of the Mikado pheasant (S. mikado) settled Taiwan, apparently during the period when that island separated from the mainland and alternated between being a peninsula and an island for some time. They were finally isolated no later than the Late Pliocene; the species is melanistic, suggesting a small founder population. The adjacent mainland population split into the subtropical and partially leucistic <b>Elliot's</b> <b>pheasant</b> (S. ellioti) and the tropical Mrs. Hume's pheasant only in the Middle Pleistocene, around half a million years ago. This divergence was probably in some way connected to climate changes at the Günz-Mindel interglacial to Mindel boundary, when mountains in the region became dry and at times icebound. The Nanling Mountains region marks the present-day boundary between these sister species and is not inhabited by either.|$|R
