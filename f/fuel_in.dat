5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>in</b> a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as <b>fuel</b> <b>in</b> a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.|$|E

40|$|Protection of the {{environment}} and counteracting global warming require finding alternative sources of energy. One of the methods of generating energy from environmentally friendly sources is increasing the share of gaseous <b>fuels</b> <b>in</b> the total energy balance. The use of these <b>fuels</b> <b>in</b> compression-ignition (CI) engines is difficult due to their relatively high autoignition temperature. One solution for using these <b>fuels</b> <b>in</b> CI engines is operating in a dualfuel mode, where the air and gas mixture is ignited with a liquid <b>fuel</b> dose. <b>In</b> this method, a series of relatively complex chemical processes occur in the engine's combustion chamber, related to the combustion of individual fuel fractions that interact with one another. Analysis of combustion of specific <b>fuels</b> <b>in</b> this type of fuel injection to the engine is difficult {{due to the fact that}} combustion of both fuel fractions takes place simultaneously. Simulation experiments can be used to analyse the impact of diesel fuel combustion on gaseous <b>fuel</b> combustion. <b>In</b> this paper, we discuss the results of simulation tests of combustion, based on the proprietary multiphase model of a dual-fuel engine. The results obtained from the simulation allow for analysis of the combustion process of individual fuels separately, which expands the knowledge obtained from experimental tests on the engine...|$|R
