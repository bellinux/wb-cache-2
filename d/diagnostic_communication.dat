40|$|Abstract: Standardization is {{very much}} the trend in the {{development}} of automotive electronics. The use of open architectures and configurable components are intended to let developers focus more on the innovative and differentiating aspects of the development process. AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) has the stated goal of standardizing a common open automotive software architecture. It is a standard platform for vehicle software. The components in AUTOSAR are hardware independent. The diagnostic stack in AUTOSAR consists of three modules: DCM, DEM and FIM. The DCM (<b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Communication</b> Manager) implements the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>communication</b> per ISO 14229 - 1. This paper focuses on the design and development of the DCM module for AUTOSAR 4. 0. The <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Communication</b> Manager (DCM) provides a common API for diagnostic services in the AUTOSAR-Basic Software.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This paper {{introduces}} a unified model for organizational {{change that is}} designed to help change analysts think through the decision-making process. Most organizational leaders do not manage change effectively because they fail to acquire the minimum amount of information necessary to make a sound decision. In large part, this deficiency is a result of considering {{only a small part of}} the organization’s total change reality, which can be expressed in terms of the following four categories: 1) Environment creates change, 2) Organization responds to environmental change, 3) Organization initiates new changes, and 4) Organization changes environment. Through the principle of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>communication,</b> leaders can adjust to the incoming changes [categories 1 and 2]. Through the principle of rhetorical communication, they can create effective outgoing changes [categories 3 and 4]. Through the principle of dialogical communication, they can achieve a strategic balance between too much conformity, which results from <b>diagnostic</b> <b>communication</b> in isolation, and too much non-conformity, which results from communication in isolation. By understanding and communicating about change from this multi-dimensional perspective, organizational leaders, both designated and non-designated, can learn to appreciate the extent to which they influence and are influenced by the larger cultural environment of which they are a part...|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} a rise in {{dementia}} awareness, with policy changes leading to increased diagnosis rates. However, the stigma of dementia is likely to cause challenges in <b>diagnostic</b> <b>communication.</b> This {{is complicated by the}} effect of dementia on cognitive functioning. The aims of this study were to (1) identify how diagnoses of dementia are communicated, (2) identify how people with dementia respond to the diagnosis, and (3) explore doctors’ perspectives on dementia diagnosis delivery. Methodology: A systematic literature review was conducted. Twenty doctors from 9 memory clinics across 4 NHS trusts participated. Eighty-one dementia diagnosis feedback meetings were video-recorded. Conversation analysis was used to identify patterns in diagnosis delivery. Four focus groups with the participating doctors were analysed using thematic analysis (inter-rater reliability 0. 89). Findings: The literature review highlighted the dilemma of communicating both sensitively and honestly with people with dementia, as well as challenges stemming from cognitive impairment. This was also evident in <b>diagnostic</b> <b>communication.</b> Prior to diagnosis doctors elicited patient orientation to the meeting purpose (“do you know why you’re here?) and perspective into symptoms (“how is your memory?”). The majority of patients displayed some confusion as to the meeting purpose and offered non-medicalised explanations for their symptoms. Doctors attempted to address this through repeated explication of test results and statements of the clinic purpose. Dementia was always explicitly named. Diagnoses were often delivered indirectly (“that is dementia”), a practice to manage patient resistance and negative responses. However, over 40...|$|E

These days, more and more OEMs are trying to introduce AUTOSAR in their products. Since there are a large amount of diagnostic IDs needed in the Engine control unit and also a huge effort is necessary to configure the ECU, it is very much important to have a tool to generate some parts of the Engine Control Unit software, most importantly the diagnostics software. <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Communication</b> manager is one such AUTOSAR module which deals with a huge amount of diagnostic data identifiers. Also at BEG, In the actual Non-AUTOSAR Bosch Automotive software, {{there are a number of}} different features that are needed and expected in the future AUTOSAR software. The aim of this thesis is to develop a tool that successfully introduces AUTOSAR in the BEG projects with all the necessary features and that is best in terms of Usability, Maintainability, and Improvability.

40|$|Background: There {{is limited}} {{understanding}} of the mechanisms used to effectively communicate with service-users about their mental health diagnoses. Aims: To conduct a systematic synthesis of studies that present data on the communication of a psychiatric diagnosis. Methods: Comprehensive database and manual searches were conducted resulting in the inclusion of 30 quantitative and qualitative papers. Results: The majority of studies were descriptive. The rate of service-users being informed of their diagnosis has increased over the past decade. Consumer communication preferences were not always satisfactorily addressed in practice. Individual characteristics of service-users and clinicians influenced whether a diagnostic discussion took place. Results from intervention studies aimed at facilitating <b>diagnostic</b> <b>communication</b> reported significant improvements in service-user satisfaction and mood and clinician communication skills. Conclusions: This review highlights {{a gap in the}} system of communication between clinicians and service-users.

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} impact of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>communication</b> upon {{the way in which}} people receive and respond to a {{diagnosis}} of chlamydial infection. Methods: A qualitative study examining the responses of individuals to a diagnosis of chlamydial infection. The study was conducted in a genitourinary medicine clinic and a family planning clinic in the Midlands region of the UK. The sample size was 50 and included both males and females. Data collection was by means of unstructured interviews, which were audio-taped and fully transcribed. The principles of grounded theory were followed in the sampling, analysis and exploration of the literature. Results: A diagnosis of chlamydial infection was commonly unexpected and associated with negative reactions, which derived from the social construction of sexually transmitted infections as evidence of breaching the moral code. The way in which the health professional communicated the diagnosis contributed to the patient response, either negatively by reinforcing feelings of self-recrimination or positively by the provision of key information that appeared to be helpful in modifying that response. Conclusion: Sensitive management and the provision of contextualised information serve an important function for those diagnosed with chlamydial infection. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of review: There are {{complexities}} {{in communicating}} diagnostic {{information relating to}} schizophrenia spectrum disorders. There is a current dearth of research in understanding how clinicians effectively communicate with service users about such diagnostic news. In this review, we aim to synthesize the latest research throughout 2012 and 2013 that presented data relating to the communication of a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including individuals who had experienced first-episode psychosis or were in at-risk mental states. Comprehensive database and manual searches were conducted which obtained data from both service users and health professional groups. Recent findings: Fourteen quantitative and qualitative studies were found. The majority of studies were descriptive and heterogeneous in content. Key themes included service user preferences towards disclosure and diagnostic terminology, health professional training, stigma-related issues {{and the use of}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>communication</b> models. Summary: Overall, communication models that foster therapeutic relationships and actively encourage the health professional to reduce stigma may be a key to initial diagnostic discussions in clinical practice.

40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} {{the use of}} diagnostic labels by clinicians for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and calculate the label-specific and overall agreement between diagnostic labels and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnoses provided by the same clinician. Methods: State-wide active surveillance was used to ascertain children newly recognised {{with one or more}} DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder aged 0 – 15 years (incident cases) in New South Wales (NSW) between July 1999 and December 2000. Clinicians were asked to supply a diagnostic label and then complete DSM-IV criteria for each child reported. Results: Questionnaires with diagnostic label and DSM-IV criteria were returned for 348 children. The agreement between labels used and diagnosis based on DSM-IV classification system was the highest for autism (97 %) and lower for labels of Asperger disorder, pervasive developmental disorder – not otherwise specified or atypical autism (27 %). Kappa overall agreement was 0. 31. Level of agreement between label and DSM-IV diagnosis was similar for questionnaires completed by multidisciplinary teams, psychiatrists, paediatricians and psychologists working as part of a team. Conclusion: A lack of agreement between the diagnostic labelling used by clinicians and diagnosis based on DSM-IV criteria indicates a lack of consistency in <b>diagnostic</b> <b>communication</b> that is necessary to provide best clinical care, appropriate services and relevant information to parents and carers...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Whether and how {{patients}} should be told their dementia diagnosis, has been an area of much debate. While there is now recognition that early diagnosis is important for dementia care little research has looked at how dementia-related diagnostic information is actually verbally communicated. The limited previous {{research suggests that the}} absence of explicit terminology (e. g., use of the term Alzheimer’s) is problematic. This paper interrogates this assumption through a conversation analysis of British naturalistic memory clinic interaction. Method: This paper is based on video-recordings of communication within a UK memory clinic. Appointments with 29 patients and accompanying persons were recorded, and the corpus was repeatedly listened to, in conjunction with the transcripts in order to identify the segments of talk where there was an action hearable as diagnostic delivery, that is where the clinician is evaluating the patient’s condition. Results: Using a conversation analytic approach this analysis suggests that <b>diagnostic</b> <b>communication,</b> which is sensitive and responsive to the patient and their carers, is not predicated on {{the presence or absence of}} particular lexical choices. There is inherent complexity regarding dementia diagnosis, especially in the ‘early stages’, which is produced through and reflected in diagnostic talk in clinical encounters. Conclusion: In the context of continuity of dementia care, diagnostic information is communicated in a way that conforms to intersubjective norms of minimizing catastrophic reactions in medical communication, and is sensitive to problems associated with ‘insight ’ in terms of delivery and receipt or non-receipt of diagnosis...|$|E

A burgeoning body of scholarship on the topic displays high expectations for such tools to increase the efficiency of pandemic response. This article reviews empirical uses of communications technology in humanitarian and pandemic response, and the 2014 Ebola response in particular, in order to propose a three-part conceptual model for the new informatics of pandemic response. This model distinguishes between the use of digital <b>communication</b> tools for <b>diagnostic,</b> risk <b>communication,</b> and coordination activities and highlights how the influx of novel actors and tendencies towards digital and operational convergence risks focusing humanitarian action and decision-making outside national authorities’ spheres of influence in pandemic response. This risk exacerbates a fundamental tension between the humanitarian promise of new technologies and the fundamental norm that international humanitarian response should complement and give primacy to the role of national authorities when possible. The article closes with recommendations for ensuring the inclusion of roles and agency for national authorities in technology-supported communication processes for pandemic response.|$|R
40|$|Communication is an {{essential}} element of good medical practice also in pathology. In contrast to technical or <b>diagnostic</b> skills, <b>communication</b> skills are not easy to define, teach, or assess. Rules almost do not exist. In this paper, which has a rather personal character and cannot be taken as a set of guidelines, important aspects of communication in pathology are explored. This includes what should be communicated to the pathologist on the pathology request form, communication between pathologists during internal (interpathologist) consultation, communication around frozen section diagnoses, modalities of communication of a final diagnosis, with whom and how critical and unexpected findings should be communicated, (in-) adequate routes of communication for pathology diagnoses, who will (or might) receive pathology reports, and what should be communicated and how in case of an error or a technical problem. An earlier more formal description of what the responsibilities are of a pathologist as communicator and as collaborator in a medical team is added in separate tables.

40|$|Background: Transparent <b>diagnostic</b> <b>communication</b> is {{considered}} best practice for clinicians. However, while patients expect {{to receive a}} schizophrenia diagnosis from their psychiatrist, research suggests mental health clinicians are often reluctant to provide this information to patients. Aim: This study examines the perceptions of people with schizophrenia surrounding the communication of this diagnosis. Methods: A generic qualitative methodological approach was used. A total of 14 patients with schizophrenia were recruited through community mental health services (n= 10) and the Australia Schizophrenia Research Bank (ASRB; n= 4) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore the experiences and perceptions of people with schizophrenia about the way a schizophrenia diagnosis was communicated by mental health clinicians. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, codes generated and thematic analysis undertaken aided by NVivo. Results: The majority of participants felt it was beneficial to receive a diagnosis despite acknowledging the distress this information sometimes caused, with many reporting this knowledge gave a sense of relief. It helped to understand their experiences and behaviours, improved their trust in the psychiatric system and increased treatment adherence. However, many reported difficulty in obtaining information about their condition, its treatment and prognosis, and expressed dissatisfaction with the way a diagnosis of schizophrenia was communicated. Discussion: Insight into the perceptions and experiences of patients with schizophrenia about how a diagnosis of schizophrenia is communicated is a key outcome of this research. This knowledge will inform the development of future training programmes for mental health clinicians, and influence the clinical practice of health professionals treating patients with schizophrenia...|$|E

Rapidly spreading new diseases, such as Xanthomonas wilt presentunique diagnostic challenges. Surveys conducted in East and West Africadocumented the lack of sufficient equipment, supplies, reference materials andtraining in the majority of plant pathology laboratories charged with diseasediagnoses. To begin to address these issues, the International Plant DiagnosticNetwork (IPDN) was established in East and West Africa in 2006, through theIntegrated Pest Management Collaborative Research Support Program (IPMCRSP). The IPDN is a <b>diagnostic,</b> <b>communication</b> and data network, modeled inpart on the United States National Plant Diagnostic Network. Software for digitalimaging and diagnosis and information management provides a platform forenhanced diagnosis and communication amongst clinicians and their clientele. Improved diagnostics tools and protocols were also developed and tested, including aPCR assay for Xanthomonas wilt. Training programs were conducted in Benin in 2006, Kenya and the United States of America in 2007, and Uganda and Mali in 2008, to enhance technical capacity amongst diagnosticians in East and West Africa. Initiatives such as IPDN can benefit by collaboration with other similar internetbasedinitiatives in Africa. One such activity is the East Africa PhytosanitaryInformation Committee (EAPIC). EAPIC is linked to the Food and AgriculturalOrganization’s International Plant Portal to provide the official national plantprotection organization posting of plant pests for each respective country, whichnow includes Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
