Dennis Madalone managed to save some time during the production {{as one of the}} shots involved Bashir seeing Falcon approach him from behind by seeing his reflection in a bottle of champagne. After time was already scheduled to attempt the shot, Madalone explained to the director that he could take the filmed sequence and digitally manipulate it onto the bottle. Madalone was also responsible for firing a cork from a bottle at Colm Meaney's head from off screen to make it appear as if Bashir did it, and managed to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first take.|$|E

On September 12, up by 22 games, the Mets came to Philadelphia for a three game weekend series needing one win to clinch the division. The Mets brought champagne to Philadelphia. Before the series, Mets manager Davey Johnson told the Associated Press, [...] "It will be nice to clinch in Philadelphia. It gives {{us a chance to}} beat the only team in our way...I have a nice warm feeling about this." [...] He told The Philadelphia Inquirer: [...] "For the fans...it would be nicer to clinch at home. But for the safety...and the livelihood of the players...it's better to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road." [...] In the series opener, Mike Schmidt hit a three-run homer, Phillies rookie Bruce Ruffin out pitched the Mets' Dwight Gooden, and the Phillies won, 6–3. The Phillies won the second game of the series, 6–5; visiting Mets fans became unruly and damaged seats in the upper deck. One Mets fan was arrested after hitting two Philadelphia police officers. The Phillies completed the sweep by beating the Mets, 6–0, behind a shutout from Kevin Gross, drove in two runs with a fourth-inning triple. The Mets would clinch the division at Shea Stadium on September 17.

2500|$|Scholastic theologians {{from the}} 11th to 13th centuries shifted the time scheme to motives; {{the desire to}} procreate with [...] "joy in a new servant of God" [...] was {{considered}} the best motive for intercourse. Bertold of Regensburg considered a woman innocent if {{she was forced to}} <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> prohibited times by her husband and she did not will it. Because intercourse was only allowed for procreative reasons, various penitentials (rule books) also forbade intercourse between sterile or older partners, although never assigning a penalty. Heinemann says that oral and anal intercourse were often punished by more years of penance than for premeditated murder, as they prevented conception from occurring. Although practice varied, menstruating women were often forbidden to attend Mass or receive Communion, in which the Latin Church took a more moderate stance than the Eastern Churches. Since the blood from childbirth was believed more harmful than menstrual blood, the Synod of Trier (1227) ruled that women who had just given birth had to be [...] "reconciled with the Church" [...] before they allowed to enter church. They often could not buried in the cemetery if they died in childbirth before had undergone a purifying ritual, a policy which was rejected by several synods. The Council of Trent (1566), and several synods after that, did not impose abstinence from intercourse on certain times as an [...] "obligation", but as an [...] "admonition".|$|E
