5|$|Some breeders {{have shown}} concern {{regarding}} {{the lack of}} genetic diversity in the breed due to inbreeding caused by a small gene pool. Researchers who completed the 2007 DNA {{study found that the}} Singapura (along with the Burmese) <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> genetic diversity among the 22 breeds studied. The possibility of outcrossing with another breed to increase the genetic diversity had been raised among CFA breeders, but not many were receptive to the idea, preferring to use Singapuras from around the world that are not so closely related to the CFA line. In April 2013, UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy started allowing outcrossing for the breed. Individuals chosen have to meet certain health and appearance requirements.|$|E

25|$|The {{theoretical}} {{index of}} hair bending stiffness is calculated using the thickest and thinnest axial diameters of human hair, and this index differs by race. The hair stiffness indexes of Mongoloids, Africans and Europeans are: 4.23, 2.75 and 1.59, respectively. This means that Mongoloids {{with the highest}} hair stiffness index value of 4.23 have the most rigid hair and Europeans with the lowest hair stiffness index value of 1.59 <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> rigid hair. The eccentricity of hair cross-sectional shape index is also calculated using the thickest and thinnest axial diameters of human hair, and this index also differs by race. The hair eccentricity indexes of Africans, Europeans and Mongoloids are: 1.74, 1.49 and 1.30, respectively.

25|$|Just as with hitpoints, {{different}} types of units have different amounts of morale. Commanders have the most morale, and basic infantry usually <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>least.</b> Attaching (when possible) a commander unit to basic squads significantly increases their morale. Some weapon types, such as flamethrowers, sniper rifles and artillery bombardment, are especially effective at demoralizing the enemy. Favorable terrain such as craters, ruins or thick jungle give units a defensive cover bonus against both hitpoint and morale damage, while water and swamps will decrease their defensive ability.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance varies for daily, regular {{caffeine}} {{users and}} high caffeine users. High doses of caffeine (750 to 1200mg/day {{spread throughout the}} day) {{have been shown to}} produce complete tolerance to some, but not all of the effects of caffeine. Doses as low as 100mg/day, such as a 6 oz cup of coffee or two to three 12 oz servings of caffeinated soft-drink, may continue to cause sleep disruption, among other intolerances. Non-regular caffeine users <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> caffeine tolerance for sleep disruption. Some coffee drinkers develop tolerance to its undesired sleep-disrupting effects, but others apparently do not.|$|E

25|$|The Samaveda Samhita {{consists}} of 1549 stanzas, taken almost entirely (except for 75 mantras) from the Rigveda. The Samaveda samhita has two major parts. The first part includes four melody collections (gāna, गान) {{and the second}} part three verse “books” (ārcika, आर्चिक). A melody in the song books corresponds to a verse in the arcika books. Just as in the Rigveda, the early sections of Samaveda typically begin with hymns to Agni and Indra but shift to the abstract. Their meters shift also in a descending order. The songs in the later sections of the Samaveda <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> deviation from the hymns derived from the Rigveda.|$|E
25|$|Saddle seat, is a {{primarily}} American discipline, though {{has recently}} become somewhat popular in South Africa, {{was created to}} show to best advantage the animated movement of high-stepping and gaited breeds such as the American Saddlebred and the Tennessee Walker. Some Arabians and Morgans are also shown saddle seat in the United States. There are usually three basic divisions. Park divisions are for the horses with the highest action. Pleasure divisions still emphasis animated action, but to a lesser degree, with manners ranking over animation. Plantation or Country divisions <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> amount of animation (in some breeds, the horses are flat-shod) and the greatest emphasis on manners.|$|E
40|$|Biofertilizer {{is defined}} as a {{substance}} which contains living organisms which, when applied to seed, plant surface, or soil, colonize the rhizosphere or interior of the plant and promote growth by increasing the supply or availability of primary nutrients to the host plant. Biofertilizers are well recognized as an important component of integrated plant nutrient management for sustainable agriculture and hold a great promise improve crop yield. The present study for the sake of evaluating the use of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria produced by Pseudomonas sp. and phosphate bio fertilizers produced by Pseudomonas putida strain P 13 and Pantoea agglomerans strain P 5 and chemical fertilizers in the separate treatments on yield and yield components of cucumber by using a factorial experiment in completely randomized block design with three repetition were performed in the field. The symbol of P represents chemical fertilizer by amount of respectively (0, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 %), B 1 shows plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and B 2 indicates bio fertilizer- 2. The results showed that P 1 B 0 <b>has</b> <b>the</b> most yield, and control treatments <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> yield. P 100 B 1 <b>has</b> <b>the</b> most length of plant and P 100 B 0 <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> length of plant, P 25 B 1 <b>has</b> <b>the</b> most amount of chlorophyll and P 75 B 2 <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> chlorophyll.

25|$|Like spiral galaxies, {{lenticular}} galaxies can {{possess a}} central bar structure. While the classification system for normal lenticulars depends on dust content, barred lenticular galaxies are classified by {{the prominence of}} the central bar. SB01 galaxies <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> defined bar structure and are only classified as having slightly enhanced surface brightness along {{opposite sides of the}} central bulge. The prominence of the bar increases with index number, thus SB03 galaxies have very well defined bars that can extend through the transition region between the bulge and disk. Unfortunately, the properties of bars in lenticular galaxies have not been researched in great detail. Understanding these properties, as well as understanding the formation mechanism for bars, would help clarify the formation or evolution history of lenticular galaxies.|$|E
25|$|Heinz tomato ketchup’s {{ingredients}} are: {{tomato concentrate}} from red ripe tomatoes, distilled vinegar, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, salt, spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring. Tomato concentrate from red ripe tomatoes {{is the first}} ingredient on the list, which means it has {{the highest percentage of}} weight within the final product. Tomatoes have a complex composition of sugars, starch, pectin, ascorbic acids, organic acids, amino acids, steroids, carotenoids, lipids, free fatty acids, and volatiles. The second ingredient listed is distilled vinegar, which is eighty percent pure water and twenty percent acetic acid. Next is high fructose corn syrup, which is made up of 42% fructose, 53% glucose, and 5% other polysaccharides and sugars. Corn syrup is 100% glucose. Salt is the next ingredient listed and is composed of sodium and chloride ions. Spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring are the last ingredients on the list, meaning that they <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> percent weight. These three ingredients contribute to overall flavor of the product.|$|E
25|$|Benchtop {{table saws}} {{are the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The universal motor is not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop table saw is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which makes it harder to make a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from the front edge of the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by the table in front of the blade). Benchtop saws are the smallest type of table saw and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E
