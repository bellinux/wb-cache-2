In response to these attacks, which cost Iraq billions of US dollars in lost oil-export revenues and repair costs, the US military set up the Task Force Shield to guard Iraq's energy infrastructure and the Kirkuk-Ceyhan Oil Pipeline in particular. In {{spite of the fact}} that little damage was done to Iraq's oil fields during the war itself, looting and sabotage after the war ended was highly destructive and accounted for perhaps eighty percent of the total damage.|$|E

500|$|The Riga summit was {{the first}} NATO summit which underscored the need for energy security, {{following}} the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute. The [...] "Riga Summit Declaration" [...] (par. 45) stated that [...] "Alliance security interests can also {{be affected by the}} disruption of the flow of vital resources" [...] and that it supported [...] "a coordinated, international effort to assess risks to <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and to promote energy infrastructure security." [...] It further states that NATO leaders [...] "direct the Council in Permanent Session to consult on the most immediate risks in the field of energy security, in order to define those areas where NATO may add value to safeguard the security interests of the Allies and, upon request, assist national and international efforts." [...] Radio Free Europe reports that an unnamed diplomatic source told that several NATO leaders, including Latvian president Vaira Vike-Freiberga, had tried to make arrangements for bilateral talks concerning this topic with Russian president Vladimir Putin during the summit, but Putin instead attended the CIS energy summit in Minsk, Belarus on 28 November 2006. In contrast, The Independent reported that the summit was marred by a diplomat fracas over an invitation to President Vladimir Putin and that he was eventually not invited, and that Putin as a result threatened that he would visit Latvia {{for the first time since}} independence during the summit in order to upstage the summit. It was even proposed that Putin could honour French president Jacques Chirac, who was at the summit and whose 74th birthday coincided with the summit, by visiting Latvia. He later made clear that this would not go ahead.|$|E

Achieving energy security is a complex task—involving important technical, economic, and geopolitical dimensions—and the ability to deliver energy supplies to the sources of demand for energy is a fundamental component of this task. Delivery {{is the role of the}} <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> system. A 2001 report prepared by the U. S.
