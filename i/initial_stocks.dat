While undertaking this work in 1992, IAEA inspectors found discrepancies which indicated that the reprocessing plant had been used more often than the DPRK had declared, which suggested that the DPRK could have weapons-grade plutonium which it had not declared to the IAEA. Information passed to the IAEA by a Member State (as required by the IAEA) supported that suggestion by indicating that the DPRK had two undeclared waste or other storage sites.|$|E

50|$|SFC models usually {{consist of}} two main {{components:}} an accounting part {{and a set}} of equations describing the laws of motion of the system. The consistency of the accounting is ensured by the use of three matrices: i) the aggregate balance sheets, with all the <b>initial</b> <b>stocks,</b> ii) the transaction flow, recording all the transactions taking places in the economy (e.g. consumption, interests payments); iii) the stock revaluation matrix, showing the changes in the stocks resulting from the transactions (the transaction flow and the stock revaluation matrix are often merged in the full integration matrix). The matrices are built respecting intuitive principles. Someone’s asset is someone else’s liability and someone’s inflow is someone else’s outflows. Furthermore, each sector and {{the economy as a whole}} must respect their budget constraint. No fund can come from (or end up) nowhere.|$|E

40|$|We present {{univariate}} {{and multivariate}} {{evidence to show}} that firms which engage in <b>initial</b> <b>stock</b> repurchases have some specific economic and financial attributes when compared to size-and industry-matched firms. We find that initial repurchase firms are younger, have lower leverage and operating risk, and higher payouts, operating cash flows, profitability and market-to-book than matched non-repurchase firms. Compared to secondary or “seasoned” repurchase matched firms, these initial repurchase firms are also younger and have higher cash, profitability, sales growth and market-to-book, as well as lower payouts, leverage and retained earnings. Therefore, we analyze the determinants and motivations that may explain why firms repurchase their own stock for the first time by studying the theoretical hypotheses found in the financial literature that are most important in explaining <b>initial</b> <b>stock</b> repurchases. The results support the free cash flow and risk reduction signaling hypotheses and the flexibility motivation for conducting stock repurchases. We do not find strong support for any other theoretical explanations of stock repurchases, such as undervaluation signaling, timing, tax effects and options and dilution hypotheses. <b>Stock</b> Repurchases, <b>Initial</b> <b>Stock</b> Repurchases; Payout Policy, Theoretical Hypotheses. ...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the influence of organic broiler production on the soils of two contrasting outdoor-runs (grassland vs. oak grove) regarding the stocks of C, N, P, Cu and Zn. 25 composite samples were composed for each outdoor-run. The <b>initial</b> <b>stocks</b> of C, N, P, Cu and Zn were determined for two horizons by measuring bulk density and total or available elements content. The excretion of C, N, P, Cu and Zn of broilers was estimated with French references and compared to detections thresholds calculated from initial stock values in order to determine whether significant stock variations could be detectable or not. C and N <b>initial</b> <b>stocks</b> vary correlatively in space and are higher in the oak grove soil. P stocks are important with a great spatial variability. Cu and Zn stocks are similar in both outdoorruns and beyond national standards. The theoretical variations in C, N and P stocks will be detectable whereas Cu and Zn stock variations will be not. The final actual stocks of C, N, P, Cu and Zn will be measured with the same method and compared to the results presented in this study...|$|E

40|$|Copepods are {{the most}} common metazoans in the marine {{environment}} and are considered to be ideal live prey for fish larvae. However, the difficulty in their culture, particularly at high culture density, hinders their use in aquaculture hatcheries. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of <b>initial</b> <b>stocking</b> density on a range of biological parameters affecting the culture productivity of the calanoid copepod Parvocalanus crassirostris. Five <b>initial</b> <b>stocking</b> densities of 1000, 3000, 5000, 7000 and 9000 adults L− 1 were evaluated. Among the treatment differences on both daily and total egg production, the egg hatching rate and mortality rate were all highly significant (p < 0. 001). Egg production was monitored over seven consecutive days, and the density of 5000 adults L− 1 produced significantly (p < 0. 001) more eggs daily than did the other treatments. Egg hatching success was very high at 91. 8 – 92. 3 % at the lower <b>initial</b> <b>stocking</b> density of ≤ 5000 adults L− 1; however, as density increased to ≥ 7000 adults L− 1, it dropped sharply to only 55 – 73 %. Similarly, significantly higher adult mortality rates were recorded for densities ≥ 7000 adults L− 1. Moreover, population growth was evaluated for a 15 -day culture period. It showed that the <b>initial</b> <b>stocking</b> density of 5000 adults L− 1 produced the highest final population (6429. 4 ± 202. 2 individuals L− 1) at the end of the culture period. However, in terms of percentage population growth over the initial population, it was the lowest density of 1000 adults L− 1 that achieved the highest growth (319. 4 ± 20. 0 %), while high density treatments of 7000 and 9000 adults L− 1 suffered negative percentage growth. Interestingly, the sex ratio was also significantly affected by <b>initial</b> <b>stocking</b> densities as the male to female ratio increased significantly at a density of ≥ 7000 adults L− 1. Our results demonstrated that P. crassirostris is a highly promising species for culture as live prey for aquaculture hatcheries, and it can be stocked at a high initial density of 5000 adults L− 1 without negatively impacting culture productivity...|$|R
