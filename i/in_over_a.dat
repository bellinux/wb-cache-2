50|$|A {{gradient}} is {{the change}} in the value of a quantity (e.g., concentration, pressure, temperature) with the change in another variable (usually distance). For example, <b>a</b> change <b>in</b> concentration <b>over</b> <b>a</b> distance is called a concentration gradient, <b>a</b> change <b>in</b> pressure <b>over</b> <b>a</b> distance is called a pressure gradient, and <b>a</b> change <b>in</b> temperature <b>over</b> <b>a</b> distance is a called a temperature gradient.|$|R

5|$|Germany was {{affected}} by the European migrant crisis in 2015 as it became the final destination of choice for many asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East entering the EU. The country took <b>in</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> million refugees and migrants and developed a quota system which redistributed migrants around its federal states based on their tax income and existing population density.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joan was a {{powerful}} hurricane that caused death and destruction <b>in</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> dozen countries in the Caribbean and Central America. Moving on a due west course for nearly two weeks in October 1988, Hurricane Joan caused widespread flooding and over 200 deaths after moving into Central America. Widespread suffering and economic crises were exacerbated by Joan, primarily across Nicaragua, as heavy rains and high winds impacted those near the hurricane's path.|$|E
5|$|Island {{restoration}} techniques, {{pioneered by}} New Zealand, enable {{the removal of}} exotic invaders from increasingly large islands. Feral cats {{have been removed from}} Ascension Island, Arctic foxes from many islands in the Aleutian Islands, and rats from Campbell Island. The removal of these introduced species has led to increases in numbers of species under pressure and even the return of extirpated ones. After the removal of cats from Ascension Island, seabirds began to nest there again for the first time <b>in</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> hundred years.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{this move}} to the Vanilla Studios {{rehearsal}} space, the Clash's songwriters Mick Jones and Joe Strummer had experienced a period of writer's block. They had not written a new song from scratch <b>in</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> year, with the material on their recently released Cost of Living EP, composed of a cover song and three songs that had all been written over twelve months earlier. The Clash arrived at Vanilla in May 1979 without a single new song prepared for their third album.|$|E
5|$|The {{mining sector}} remains very lucrative, {{with some of}} the world's largest {{platinum}} reserves being mined by Anglo American plc and Impala Platinum.

They have the potential to improve the fiscal situation of the country considerably, but almost all revenues from the field have disappeared into the pockets of army officers and ZANU-PF politicians.|$|E

5|$|After Dhoni {{suffered}} from a finger injury, Karthik replaced him for the Third Test at Newlands against South Africa, playing in his first Test <b>in</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> year. With regular opener Virender Sehwag suffering from a loss of form, Karthik opened the innings with Wasim Jaffer, allowing Sehwag to bat in the middle order. He used his domestic experience to score 63 in the first innings, combining in a century opening stand, helping India to 414, enough for a first innings lead of 41. In the second innings, he scored an unbeaten 38, as the team suffered a batting collapse and were all out for 169, allowing the hosts to take the series 21 by five wickets. In addition to his batting, his wicket-keeping was praised and brought former South African fast bowler Allan Donald to predict further success in the future.|$|E

5|$|After {{a five-year}} split, it was {{announced}} in October 2008 that O'Meara, Cattermole, and McIntosh were to perform a mini-reunion tour. The tour consisted {{of a series of}} university and nightclub gigs, where they performed a set list consisting of a selection of songs from their greatest hits album. After O'Meara, Cattermole and McIntosh reunited, rumours persisted that all the original members would reunite. In October 2014, it was confirmed that the original lineup would reunite for the first time <b>in</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> decade for BBC Children in Need, later announcing a UK reunion tour for 2015.|$|E
5|$|After {{only six}} games in Milwaukee, McGrattan was traded {{back to the}} Flames, in {{exchange}} for Joe Piskula, on February 28, 2013. McGrattan's positive influence {{in the locker room}} as a player always prepared to play was cited as a reason why Calgary re-acquired him. The Flames also expected he would add a physical presence to the team, which he did in his re-debut with the Flames, a 4–2 victory over Vancouver that included several hits and a fight with Tom Sestito – his first NHL fight <b>in</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> year. He gave the crowd a salute following the fight, sending the fans into a frenzy and earning a ten-minute misconduct. He finished the season with three goals and 49 PIM in 19 games with the Flames, and earned a two-year contract extension from the team.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{commercial}} and critical success, the play closed after 31 performances when Barrymore collapsed, suffering a nervous breakdown. Since appearing in Redemption {{he had worked}} ceaselessly, appearing on stage in the evenings, while planning or rehearsing the next production during the day, {{and by the time}} he appeared as Richard, he was spending his daytimes filming Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He spent six weeks recuperating under the ministrations of his father's friend, wrestler William Muldoon, who ran a sanitarium. During the summer of 1920, Oelrichs became pregnant with Barrymore's child, and a quick divorce was arranged with her husband, which left her and Barrymore free to marry in August that year; a daughter, Diana Barrymore, followed in March 1921. Soon after the birth, he began rehearsals for Clair de Lune, which his wife had adapted from Victor Hugo's 1869 novel The Man Who Laughs. Barrymore persuaded Ethel to play the role of the Queen– it was the first time the two had appeared on stage together <b>in</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> decade. The play was a critical flop, although the presence of the siblings ensured that it ran for over 60 performances.|$|E

5|$|Between 1986 and 1996, River Oaks Elementary School only {{admitted}} {{magnet school}} students {{from other areas}} of the city. The community was divided between the attendance zones of Wilson Elementary School (opened in 1925), the now closed Will Rogers Elementary School (opened in 1950, closed in summer 2006), and Poe Elementary School. By 1995 River Oaks Elementary {{became one of the most}} prestigious elementary schools in Houston and had a waiting list. By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in sending their children to public school. In 1995, several River Oaks parents petitioned HISD to re-establish the neighborhood program at River Oaks Elementary School which allows non-magnet students residing in the school's boundaries to attend. Some magnet parents opposed, believing that the River Oaks program would reduce racial diversity at the school. In 1996, HISD added a neighborhood program to the school for grades Kindergarten through 2nd, with grades 3 through 5 phased <b>in</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> subsequent three-year period.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time <b>in</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> decade.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{remained}} with Charlotte {{for the beginning}} of the 2011–12 season, failing to make the Hurricanes' roster out of training camp. In November 2011, he received a call-up to Carolina that lasted five days. The following month, he was recalled again and recorded a two-goal game against the Vancouver Canucks on December 15, 2011. The goals were his first in the NHL <b>in</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> year and eight months. After being reassigned, he received two more call ups {{before the end of the}} season. Bowman finished the season with 13 points over 37 NHL games in Carolina and 26 points over 42 AHL games in Charlotte. In the off-season, he was tendered a qualifying offer from the Hurricanes in order to retain his restricted free agent status.|$|E
