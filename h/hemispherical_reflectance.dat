40|$|This paper {{presents}} empirical {{and theoretical}} analyses of spectral <b>hemispherical</b> <b>reflectances</b> and transmittances of individual leaves {{and the entire}} canopy sampled at two sites representative of equatorial rainforests and temperate coniferous forests. The empirical analysis indicates that some simple algebraic combinations of leaf and canopy spectral transmittances and reflectances eliminate their dependencies on wavelength through the specification of two canopy-specific wavelength-independent variables. These variables and leaf optical properties govern the energy conservation in vegetation canopies at any given wavelength of the solar spectrum. The presented theoretical development indicates these canopy-specific wavelength-independent variables characterize {{the capacity of the}} canopy to intercept and transmit solar radiation under two extreme situations, namely, when individual leaves 1) are completely absorptive and 2) totally reflect and/or transmit the incident radiation. The interactions of photons with the canopy at red and near-infrared (IR) spectral bands approximate these extreme situations well. One can treat the vegetation canopy as a dynamical system and the canopy spectral interception and transmission as dynamical variables. The system has two independent states: canopies with totally absorbing and totally scattering leaves. Intermediate states are a superposition of these pure states. Such an interpretation provides powerful means to accurately specify changes in canopy structure both from ground-based measurements and remotely sensed data. This concept underlies the operational algorithm of global leaf area index (LAI), and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation developed for the moderate resolution imaging spectror [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parametric {{study of the}} time-resolved <b>hemispherical</b> <b>reflectance</b> of a plane-parallel slab of homogeneous, cold, absorbing, and isotropically scattering medium exposed to a collimated Gaussian pulse. The front surface of the slab is transparent while the back surface {{is assumed to be}} cold and black. The I-D time-dependent radiation transfer equation is solved using the modified method of characteristics. The parameters explored include (1) the optical thickness, (2) the single scattering albedo of the medium, and (3) the incident pulse width. The study pays particular attention to the maximum transient <b>hemispherical</b> <b>reflectance</b> and identifies optically thin and thick regimes. It shows that the maximum reflectance is independent of the optical thickness in the optically thick regime. In the optically thin regime, however, the maximum <b>hemispherical</b> <b>reflectance</b> depends on all three parameters explored. The transition between the optically thick and thin regimes occurs when the optical thickness is approximately equal to the dimensionless pulse width. Finally, correlations relating the maximum of the <b>hemispherical</b> <b>reflectance</b> {{as a function of the}} optical thickness, the single scattering albedo of the materials, and the incident pulse width have been developed. These correlations could be used to retrieve radiation characteristics or serve as initial guesses for more complex inversion schemes accounting for anisotropic scattering. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|International audienceThe {{specific}} surface area (SSA), {{defined as the}} surface area of ice per unit mass, is an important variable characterizing the complex microstructure of snow. Its application range covers the physical evolution of snow (metamorphism), photochemistry and optical and microwave remote sensing. This paper presents a new device, POSSSUM (Profiler Of Snow Specific Surface area Using SWIR reflectance Measurement), designed to allow the rapid acquisition of SSA profiles down to similar to 20 m depth and with an effective vertical resolution of 10 - 20 mm. POSSSUM {{is based on the}} infrared (IR) reflectance technique: A laser diode operating at 1310 nm illuminates the snow at nadir incidence angle along the face of a drilled hole. The reflected radiance is measured at three zenith angles (20 degrees, 40 degrees and 60 degrees) each for two azimuth angles (0 degrees and 180 degrees). A second laser operating at a shorter wavelength (635 nm), which is almost insensitive to SSA, allows the distance to the snow face to be estimated. The reflected IR radiance and the distance are combined to estimate bidirectional reflectances. These reflectances are converted into <b>hemispherical</b> <b>reflectances</b> and in turn into SSA using a theoretical formulation based on an asymptotic solution of the radiative transfer equation. The evaluation and validation of POSSSUM's SSA measurements took place in spring 2009 in the French Alps.

Therefore, strictly speaking our bi-conical reflectance measurements (with angles incidence = emission =  13 °, no correction for grazing angles needed) can only qualitatively be compared to our emissivity measurements made under vacuum (where the lack of air between the grains gives rise to vertical thermal gradients). However, bi-conical reflectance measurements are more representative of the way spacecraft instruments obtain reflectance measurements than <b>hemispherical</b> <b>reflectance</b> measurements. Therefore, data obtained by combining bi-conical reflectance and emission measurements can be applied directly to the analysis of data returned by NIR/TIR instruments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract − Laser {{polarimetry}} {{has been}} used for years to obtain normal spectral emissivity measurements on pulse-heated materials [1, 2]. The method is based on the FRESNEL equations that describe reflection and refraction at an ideally smooth interface between two isotropic media. However, polarimetry is frequently used with surfaces that clearly deviate from this ideal condition. Questions arise with respect to the applicability of the simple FRESNEL equations to non-specularly reflecting surfaces. On the other hand, reflectometry utilizing integrating spheres provides a measurement of the <b>hemispherical</b> spectral <b>reflectance</b> for normal incidence, from which the normal spectral emissivity 1 can be derived, regardless of surface texture. In a first effort to explore the limits of polarimetry in terms of surface roughness, room temperature measurements were performed on a number of samples using both an integrating sphere reflectometer and a laser polarimeter.

For SSA 60 m 2 kg− 1, snow is usually of low density (typically 30 to 100 kg m− 3), resulting in insufficient optical depth and 1310 nm radiation reaches the bottom of the sample, causing artifacts. The 1550 nm radiation is therefore used for SSA> 60 m 2 kg− 1. Reflectance is then in the range 5 to 12 % and the accuracy on SSA is 12 %.
