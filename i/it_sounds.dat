5|$|Some English {{surnames}} {{from the}} Middle Ages name animals. These have different origins. Some, like Pigg (1066), Hogg (1079) and Hoggard, Hogarth (1279) are metonyms for a swineherd, while Oxer (1327) similarly denotes an oxherd and Shepherd (1279 onwards) means as <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> a herder of sheep.|$|E
5|$|Join Hands {{took the}} topic of the First World War as its inspiration. Musically, it is darker than the band's debut album The Scream: <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> more claustrophobic and more haunting. It was the last album with the band's first {{recorded}} line-up, as guitarist John McKay and drummer Kenny Morris quit the group after a disagreement {{at the beginning of the}} British Join Hands tour, on the day of the album's release.|$|E
5|$|The god Bragi asks where a thundering {{sound is}} coming from, {{and says that}} the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had {{returned}} to Valhalla—and that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like the movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.|$|E

5000|$|We've {{been called}} a band that takes old music and makes <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> new. On this album Departure we take new music and make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> old. We play these {{instruments}} because they're the instruments {{we know how to}} play, but what's exciting is to take them out of the realm of expectation.|$|R

5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part Cage avoids using lower {{registers}} of the piano, {{and much of the}} music's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared {{in such a way that}} the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce sounds that retain the original frequency and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned versions of the original notes, or metallic, rattling sounds that have no sense of the fundamental frequency at all. The use of the soft pedal, which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed, but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> fairly normal if the pedal is released. It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.|$|E
5|$|The {{music in}} Final Fantasy Tactics Advance was {{primarily}} composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, with additional music contributed by Kaori Ohkoshi and Ayako Saso; Nobuo Uematsu provided the main theme. The Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Original Soundtrack album {{was released by}} DigiCube on February 19, 2003. It spans 74 tracks and has a duration of 2:05:27. The first disk includes every song from the game, as <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> through the Game Boy Advance hardware. The second disk contains fully orchestrated versions of 32 of the same 42 tracks. A new age arrangement album entitled White: Melodies of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, a selection of musical tracks from the game arranged by Yo Yamazaki, Akira Sasaki, and Satoshi Henmi, was released by SME Visual Works on February 26, 2003. White spans 11 tracks and has a duration of 46:10. Within the game, the classical-themed soundtrack is compressed into MIDI file format. Simple sound effects are used during battles, {{and there are no}} voices or speech within the game.|$|E

25|$|The {{most famous}} pattern in {{development}} is the North-South divide. The North-South divide separates the rich North or the developed world, from the poor South.

25|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the magyar duda is the double-bored chanter. One chanter bore, the dallamsíp ("melody pipe"), plays the melody within an octave range. The second chanter, the kontrasíp or kontra ("contra pipe") has a single finger hole and sounds either the lowest note on the melody pipe or drops to the dominant (i.e., on a pipe in A <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> either A or E).|$|E
25|$|The {{second section}} ("Why {{she had to}} go I don't know...") is, {{according}} to Pollack, less musically surprising on paper than <b>it</b> <b>sounds.</b> Starting with Em7, the harmonic progression quickly moves through the A-major, D-minor, and (closer to F-major) B, before resolving back to F-major, {{and at the end of}} this, McCartney holds F while the strings descend to resolve to the home key to introduce the restatement of the first section, before a brief hummed closing phrase.|$|E

25|$|For Hitchcock, the actors, {{like the}} props, {{were part of}} the film's setting, as he said to Truffaut:In my opinion, the chief {{requisite}} for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as <b>it</b> <b>sounds.</b> He should be willing to be utilised and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.|$|E
25|$|Single-piece cores do {{not need}} to be {{assembled}} because they are made in a split core box. A split core box, like <b>it</b> <b>sounds,</b> is made of two halves and has at least one hole for sand to be introduced. For simple cores that have constant cross-sections they can be created on special core-producing extruders. The extrusions are then just cut to the proper length and hardened. More complex single-piece cores can be made in a manner similar to injection moldings and die castings.|$|E
25|$|The {{lyrics are}} quite personal. I like rap music, and rappers use real-life {{language}} and don’t hold back {{in what they}} talk about. My lyrics aren’t generic pop lyrics just there because they rhyme. I’ve tried to write things as I’d say them, so <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> more like me. There’s a song called Sticks And Stones, which is about when I was 17 and I thought I’d won the jackpot when I got in the band , and then things not turning out as I might have expected. The middle eight on that song is very honest and truthful.|$|E

25|$|His {{reputation}} as a philosopher was established by his first book, Philosophy of the Unconscious (1869; 10th ed. 1890). This success was {{largely due to the}} originality of its title, the diversity of its contents (von Hartmann professing to obtain his speculative results by the methods of inductive science, and making plentiful use of concrete illustrations), its fashionable pessimism and the vigour and lucidity of its style. The conception of the Unconscious, by which von Hartmann describes his ultimate metaphysical principle is, fundamentally, not as paradoxical as <b>it</b> <b>sounds,</b> being merely a new and mysterious designation for the Absolute of German metaphysicians.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to score music for the whistle using {{standard}} musical notation. The tin whistle is not a transposing instrument - for example, music for the D tin whistle is written in concert pitch, not transposed down a tone as would be normal for transposing instruments. Nevertheless, {{there is no real}} consensus on how tin whistle music should be written, or on how reading music onto the whistle should be taught. However, when music is scored for a soprano whistle it will be written an octave lower than <b>it</b> <b>sounds,</b> to spare ledger lines and make it much easier to read.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} achieve this effect, a seam bowler usually {{delivers}} the ball with the seam held upright, with rotation about a horizontal axis. This keeps the seam aligned vertically as it travels towards the batsman, making it likely that the ball will bounce with the seam on the pitch. Of course, consistently hitting the seam is {{not as easy as}} <b>it</b> <b>sounds.</b> The seam has to be held upright between the index finger and the middle finger {{at the time of the}} delivery of the ball and, most importantly, the wrist has to be dead straight when the ball is delivered. The seam and wrist position of Australia's Glenn McGrath are arguably a perfect example.|$|E
