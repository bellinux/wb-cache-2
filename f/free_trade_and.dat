5|$|Pulsford {{established}} a successful business {{with his father}} as commission agents in Yorkshire before moving his interests to New South Wales in 1883. There he became a vigorous campaigner for <b>free</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> was a co-founder of the <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>and</b> Liberal Association in that colony, the body that would later become the machine behind the Free Trade Party. Although his attempts to enter the New South Wales Legislative Assembly were abortive, he {{was appointed to the}} Legislative Council in 1895 and served until 1901, when {{he was elected to the}} Senate. An uncompromising opponent of all forms of protectionism, following the 1909 Fusion of the anti-Labour forces he joined the Liberal Party only with reluctance.|$|E
5|$|As a Liberal MP he {{supported}} Irish Home Rule, trade unions, <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> welfare reforms. Leading {{up to the}} First World War he argued that Britain should adopt a more sympathetic approach towards Germany, including naval disarmament. When war did break out, Brunner was resolute in the opinion {{that it should be}} fought and won. In addition to the production of alkali, his factories were making other chemicals for use as explosives. He also built a new factory to purify trinitrotoluene.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, {{political}} attitudes favoured <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> laissez-faire {{policies and}} a gradual widening {{of the voting}} franchise. During the 19th Century, Britain's population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, which caused significant social and economic stresses. To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the Conservative Party under Benjamin Disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa, and elsewhere. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand became self-governing dominions.|$|E

5|$|Neild {{was not a}} {{supporter}} of party discipline, refusing to follow Sir Josiah Symon's leadership of the Free Trade Senators. He spoke against the dictation test for non-British immigrants and the deportation of Kanaka workers, and continued to advocate <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> old-age pensions. Having won the fifth position at the 1901 election, Neild faced re-election in 1903, and his impassioned support of the British Empire saw him elected {{at the head of}} the poll despite failing health.|$|E
5|$|Other {{factors may}} include Enlightenment {{thinking}} and {{the examples of}} the Atlantic Revolutions. The Enlightenment spurred the desire for social and economic reform to spread throughout Spanish America and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> physiocratic economics were raised by the Enlightenment in Spain and spread to the overseas empire and a homegrown Spanish American Enlightenment. The political reforms implemented and the many constitutions written both in Spain and throughout the Spanish world during the wars of independence were influenced by these factors.|$|E
5|$|Although the Convertibility {{plan had}} {{positive}} consequences {{in the short}} term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. The <b>free</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> the expensive costs in dollars, forced private companies {{to reduce the number}} of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E

5|$|Elected in 1901 to the Senate, Neild was a {{vigorous}} supporter of old-age pensions, <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> several other causes, but his ambitions of promotion were never realised. Passionately {{loyal to the}} British Empire, he questioned aspects of the White Australia policy and spoke {{in support of the}} children of Kanaka labourers facing deportation. His continued disputes with the military, including an attempt to have the commander of the Australian military forces found in contempt of Parliament, saw him lose respect among his colleagues and his later career was spent in comparative isolation. He lost his seat in 1910 and died the following year.|$|E
5|$|Hendrik Pieter Nicolaas Muller {{was born}} in Rotterdam (Netherlands) on 2 April 1859, as the third child and second son of Hendrik Muller Sz. and Marie Cornelie van Rijckevorsel. His father was a {{successful}} businessman based in Rotterdam and trading with Africa and the Netherlands East Indies. H.P.N. Muller's maternal grandfather, Abram van Rijckevorsel, was the doyen of the Rotterdam merchant community {{in the early part}} of the nineteenth century. Both his father and maternal grandfather were politicians as well, liberals who staunchly defended the principle of <b>free</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> both were at one time members of the Senate of the States-General of the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution was not {{the product}} of the actions of a single {{political}} party with a clear and defined agenda, but a convergence of sectors with varying interests. Thus, {{there are a number of}} conflicting perspectives about it, because different authors highlight different aspects. Mitre, for example, referred to The Representation of the Landowners (an 1809 economic report by Mariano Moreno) and the role of the merchants to support the view that the May Revolution intended to obtain <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> economic integration with Europe; right-wing revisionists center around Saavedra and the social customs of the time to describe the revolution under conservative principles; and left-wing revisionists use the example of Moreno, Castelli and the rioters led by French and Beruti to describe it as a radical revolution.|$|E

5|$|The company {{merged with}} Newcastle Breweries in 1960, forming Scottish & Newcastle, {{a group with}} market value of Â£50 million. William McEwan Younger, the son of William Younger, was the {{chairman}} and managing director. The company dedicated itself to the <b>free</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> promoted its brands to an extent not previously witnessed in the British brewing industry. McEwan's Export {{became one of the}} three core brands of the new company, alongside Newcastle Brown Ale and Younger's Tartan Special. Scottish & Newcastle became the dominant force in brewing across Scotland and the North of England. From the 1960s, the company began to style itself MacEwan's in export markets, in order to make pronunciation easier. The company's McEwan's Strong Ale was the highest gravity beer on general sale throughout the world. McEwan's Export was alternatively sold as India Pale Ale or Scotch Ale overseas. William McEwan Younger retired in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Tyler's {{difficulties}} in domestic policy contrasted with notable accomplishments in foreign policy. He {{had long been}} an advocate of expansionism toward the Pacific and <b>free</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> was fond of evoking themes of national destiny {{and the spread of}} liberty in support of these policies. His positions were largely in line with Jackson's earlier efforts to promote American commerce across the Pacific. Eager to compete with Great Britain in international markets, he sent lawyer Caleb Cushing to China, where he negotiated the terms of the Treaty of Wanghia (1844). The same year, he sent Henry Wheaton as a minister to Berlin, where he negotiated and signed a trade agreement with the Zollverein, a coalition of German states that managed tariffs. This treaty was rejected by the Whigs, mainly as a show of hostility toward the Tyler administration.|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{set up his}} {{government}} in Chuquisaca, where he presided over the change of regime for the entire region. He planned the reorganization of the Mines of Potosi, and a reform at the University of Charcas. He proclaimed the end of native slavery and servitude in Upper Peru, and the natives were granted political rights equal {{to those of the}} criollos. Castelli forbade the establishment of new convents and parishes to avoid the common practice that, under the guise of spreading Christian doctrine, the natives were forced into servitude by religious orders. He authorized <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> redistributed land expropriated from the former workers of the mills. The decree was published in Spanish, Guarani, Quechua, and Aymara; he established several bilingual schools as well. Several Indian chiefs participated in {{the first anniversary of the}} May Revolution, celebrated in Tiahuanaco, where Castelli paid tribute to the ancient Incas and encouraged the people to rise against the Spanish. Despite their welcome, however, Castelli was aware that most of the aristocracy supported the auxiliary army out of fear instead of genuine support.|$|E

5|$|Edward Pulsford {{was born}} at Burslem in Staffordshire on 29 September 1844. His mother was Mary Ann, nÃ©e Cutler, and his father, James Eustace Pulsford, was a Baptist {{minister}} and businessman. He received a private education and worked with his father as a commission agent; together they worked in Hull, Yorkshire, from 1870 to 1884. On 23 February 1870, he married Mary Charlotte Stainforth at Hull; she would predecease him. In 1883 Edward embarked for New South Wales, while his father travelled to New York to become resident secretary of the Liverpool, London & Globe Insurance Company. After his arrival in Sydney, Pulsford immediately {{became involved in the}} free trade cause, and in 1885 he co-founded the <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>and</b> Liberal Association of New South Wales (FTLA, a forerunner of the Free Trade Party) with Bernhard Wise. His campaigning on behalf of free trade led to his becoming an honorary member of the Cobden Club.|$|E
5|$|Pulsford was {{a leading}} proponent of the free-trade cause, {{although}} an intended candidacy for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1891 did not eventuate. He had contested a by-election for East Sydney earlier that year, losing to protectionist candidate Walter Bradley. He was nevertheless nominated to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1895 by the Free Trade Premier, George Reid. He continued his support of free trade policies, but differentiated himself from his colleagues by firmly opposing restrictions on Asian immigration. He had expressed regret concerning {{the fate of the}} Australian Aborigines in a Telegraph article in 1888 and also opposed Sir Henry Parkes's poll tax on the Chinese, and now opposed the continuing restrictive measures passed in 1896 and 1898. He {{served as president of the}} Australian <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>and</b> Liberal Association's New South Wales branch in 1900 and was deputy president of the federal election campaign committee, standing himself for the Senate in New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Liniers was {{succeeded by}} Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros {{a few months}} later, who pardoned the mutineers to reduce {{political}} conflicts. Cisneros allowed free trade as well, as instructed by the Junta of Seville, which benefited British merchants; Britain was allied with Spain in the Peninsular War. The agents of the Consulate of Cadiz asserted that this would hurt the local economy, moral values, social usages, religious practices, and the loyalty to Spain and its monarchy. As a result, Cisneros closed trade again, restoring the Spanish monopsony. A group of hacendados (owners of haciendas), who did not feel adequately represented at the Cabildo, asked Moreno to defend them. Moreno wrote The Representation of the Landowners, a report that represented the export interest of the landowners, encouraged <b>free</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> condemned the privileges of the merchants benefited from the monopsony. It is considered the most comprehensive economic report {{from the time of}} the viceroyalty. It represented the new European economic ideas, and noted that the legal monopsony with Spain did not prevent British goods from being smuggled. Several authors have questioned Moreno's authorship of the paper, considering it instead an update of another, previously drafted by Manuel Belgrano, Secretary of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires, written to make a similar request to the former viceroy Liniers. This report, as well as Moreno's prestige in the colonial society, helped him gain the confidence of Cisneros. Yet secretly, Moreno supported the plan to dismiss the Viceroy.|$|E

5|$|William Huskisson's death {{made him}} one of the most famous British {{politicians}} of the period. Within a year his first biography was published, as was a volume of his collected speeches. His policies on <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> minimal government interference were a major influence on Robert Peel and William Ewart Gladstone (who grew up in Liverpool and whose father Sir John Gladstone had been a close colleague of Huskisson) and consequently on the later emergence of the Liberal Party and the doctrine of Gladstonian Liberalism. Forty years after his death Huskisson was still sufficiently well-remembered to be featured in novels, including Middlemarch and the novels of Mrs Henry Wood, with no accompanying explanation. The Australian town of Huskisson, New South Wales is named for him. Huskisson Dock, named in his honour in 1852, remains in operation as part of the Port of Liverpool. In 1880 Huskisson railway station in Liverpool opened, closing to passengers five years later but remaining operational as a goods depot until 1975. Today he is principally remembered for the manner of his death, and monuments to him stand in Pimlico, Chichester Cathedral, and Liverpool. In 1982, at a time of high racial tension following the Toxteth riots, his memorial in Liverpool was pulled down by a group of local people in the mistaken belief that it commemorated a slave trader; it was re-erected around 20 years later in Duke Street, near where he had stayed for his final nights in Liverpool.|$|E
