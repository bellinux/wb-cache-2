40|$|The {{spectrum}} of Hg (61 S 0 - 6 3 P 1) perturbed by Ar is {{obtained in the}} so-called « intermediate frequency region » which {{had not yet been}} experimentally studied. We have used a tunable <b>dye</b> laser spectrometer <b>apparatus</b> the spectral width of which varies around 2 GHz. The spectral profile does not exhibit any undulation and the shape is different for frequencies superior to or inferior to the central frequency ν 0. We determine the experimental limits of validity of the laws previously observed in the neighbouring regions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} testing of a sensitive apparatus for recording electrical activity from microcultures of rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons by using voltage-sensitive fluorescent <b>dyes.</b> The <b>apparatus</b> comprises a feedback-regulated mercury arc light source, an inverted epifluorescence microscope, a novel fiber-optic camera with discrete photodiode detectors, and low-noise preamplifiers. Using an NA 0. 75 objective and illuminating at 10 W/cm 2 with the 546 nm mercury line, a typical SCG neuron stained with the styryl dye RH 423 gives a detected photocurrent of 1 nA; the light source and optical detectors are quiet enough that the shot noise in this photocurrent [...] about. 03 % rms [...] dominates. The design, theory, and performance of this dye-recording apparatus are discussed in detail. Styryl dyes such as RH 423 typically give signals of 1 %/ 100 mV on these cells; the signals are linear in membrane potential, but {{do not appear to}} arise from a purely electrochromic mechanism. Given this voltage sensitivity and the noise level of the apparatus, {{it should be possible to}} detect both action potentials and subthreshold synaptic potentials from SCG cell bodies. In practice, dye recording can easily detect action potentials from every neuron in an SCG microculture, but small synaptic potentials are obscured by dye signals from the dense network of axons. In another microculture system that does not have such long and complex axons, this dye-recording apparatus should be able to detect synaptic potentials, making it possible to noninvasively map the synaptic connections in a microculture, and thus to study long-term synaptic plasticity...|$|R
40|$|By using lactose colored with erythrocin, we {{investigated}} the eŠects of mixing methods on mixing degree during {{the preparation of}} trituration with a mortar and pestle. The extent of powder dilution was set to 4 to 64 fold in the experi-ments. We compared the results obtained by using two methods: (1) one-step mixing of powders after addition of dil-uents and (2) gradual mixing of powders after addition of diluents. As diluents, we used crystallized lactose and pow-dered lactose for the preparation of trituration. In the preparation of 64 -fold trituration, an excellent degree of mixing was obtained, with CV values of less than 6. 08 ％, for both preparation methods and for the two kinds of diluents. The mixing of two kinds of powders whose distributions of particle sizes were similar resulted in much better degree of mix-ing, with CV values of less than 3. 0 ％. However, the concentration of principal agents in 64 -fold trituration was reduced by 20 ％ due to the adsorption of <b>dye</b> to the <b>apparatus.</b> Under conditions in which a much higher dilution rate and/or much better degree of dilution was required, it must be necessary to dilute powders with considering their physicality and to determine the concentrations of principal agents after the mixing.

40|$|YesThe {{influence}} of the dyeing industry in Pompeii on the local economy has been under discussion since the publication by Moeller in 1976. Since no absolute answer has emerged, the question was re-examined using two additional methods, experimental archaeology and the principles of thermodynamics. A full-scale replica of a <b>dyeing</b> <b>apparatus</b> from Pompeii was constructed and used to simulate repeated dye runs, and so determine operating parameters such as the times involved to heat and cool a vat and the consumables needed. This first replica also allowed {{a better understanding of}} how the apparatus was actually used. Thermodynamic principles, which were applied to understand the successes and failures within the experimental work, suggested that the vat operated in a predictable way and enabled the operational mechanics of the vat to be established. It is now possible to use both the experimental results and the thermodynamic modelling to determine not just the consumables used, but also the working environment needed for the vat to operate, allowing an understanding of the limitations to dyeing and to workers. Issues of practicality such as storage of consumables and disposal of exhaust gases may now be thoroughly examined. 2 Eventually it will be possible to determine the operating parameters of each of the dye vats, the quantities of consumables involved and the amount that could be produced. This should help answer the question as to the significance of the dye industry in Pompeii to the local economy...|$|E
40|$|One {{third of}} drugs in {{development}} are water insoluble, and one half of all drugs fail in trials because of poor pharmacokinetics. Block copolymer micelles are nanosized particles that can solubilize hydrophobic drugs and coincidentally alter their kinetics in vitro and in vivo. In using such micelles {{it is important that}} the drug is not lost due to premature vehicle disassembly and that its effectiveness is not diminished by unfavorable distribution of the micelles. Disintegration of micelles depends on a number of environmental conditions, with consequent variation in drug release rates; these rates, however, are always faster than those which occur by simple diffusion from intact micelles. When these thesis studies began no data was available on integrity of micelles in cells and in vivo, and in vitro studies of distribution of micelles were scarce. This thesis begins by providing a detailed account of the distribution of model block copolymer micelles in live cells using fluorescent-labeled polymer and confocal microscopy. Next, the evidence for endocytosis of micelles, and their effectiveness in delivering a model micelle-incorporated agent anthra[1, 9 -cd]pyrazol- 6 (2 H) -one (SP 600125) is presented. The thesis ends with an account of the disruption of integrity of micelles in vitro and in vivo, made possible by a novel application of a fluorogenic-based assessment that enables the monitoring of the integrity of micelles under complex biological conditions. Block copolymer micelles were made from Food and Drug Administration approved polymers poly(caprolactone) and poly(ethylene oxide). In vitro studies were done in cell lines (PC 12, NIH/ 3 T 3, T 24) and primary cultures (human islets of Langerhans). In vivo studies were done in hairless SKH- 1 mice. The in vitro studies demonstrated the uptake of micelles by all investigated cells. The micelles were confined to the cytoplasmic compartment, with no detectable nuclear localization. Detailed studies in PC 12 cells revealed co-localization of micelles with several organelle selective <b>dyes</b> (mitochondria, Golgi <b>apparatus,</b> endoplasinic reticulum). Pharmacological manipulations (sucrose, FK 506, wortmannin, horseradish peroxidase, methyl-beta-cyclodextrin) revealed an endocytotic uptake of micelles and suggested a significant contribution of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The effectiveness of c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinases (JNK) [...] -micelle-incorporated inhibitor, SP 600125, was demonstrated in human islets of Langerhans challenged with cytokines. Micelle-incorporated SP 600125 prevented the cytokine induced cell death of islets at a lower starting concentration (1. 5 $M in the medium) compared to free drug (20 muM). Lastly, a graded loss of integrity of micelles was demonstrated in media with increasing biological complexity, in cells, and, as a proof of principle, in vivo. Taken together, the results presented in this thesis suggest (i) a need for assessment of the integrity of micellar drug carriers under biological conditions to further improve the micelle-based drug delivery systems, (ii) the identification of the contribution of micelles with disrupted integrities to the internalization and effectiveness of micelle-incorporated drugs, (iii) an assessment of cellular retention and degradation of internalized polymers. That the pharmacokinetics of micelle-incorporated drugs reported in recent clinical trials showed only modest improvements over non-micelle delivered agents may at least in part be due to disruption of micelle integrity. Additional studies are needed to understand exactly where the delivery system goes, when and where is the drug released, and how recent advances in vehicle design and targeting can be harnessed to overcome the present challenges and realize the full potential of polymeric micelles...|$|R
