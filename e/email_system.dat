25|$|In early 2005, AOL stated its {{intention}} to implement a certified <b>email</b> <b>system</b> called Goodmail, which will allow companies to send email to users with whom they have pre-existing business relationships, with a visual indication that the email is from a trusted source and without {{the risk that the}} email messages might be blocked or stripped by spam filters.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} {{injection}} can vary a great deal; in some cases, the attacker {{may not even}} need to directly interact with the web functionality itself to exploit such a hole. Any data received by the web application (via <b>email,</b> <b>system</b> logs, IM etc.) that can be controlled by an attacker could become an injection vector.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} Gmail was {{developed}} by Paul Buchheit several years before it was announced to the public. The project was known by the code name Caribou. During early development, the project was kept secret from most of Google's own engineers. This changed once the project became better and better, and by early 2004, almost everybody was using it to access the company's internal <b>email</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

25|$|In May 2014, former acting Superintendent, Daphne Snook, {{filed suit}} against the school board and the district's {{solicitor}} for $75,000 in damages regarding her suspension during a criminal investigation. The investigation involved her using the district's <b>email</b> <b>system</b> to read school board member emails on personnel issues. The emails were focused on the hiring of a new superintendent. Snook intended to apply for that position. The investigation concluded with the county district attorney filing no criminal charges. In her suit, Snook admitted to reading the private communications between the board members.|$|E
25|$|While mourning, Greenlee {{decides to}} form a new {{cosmetics}} company to rival Enchantment. Enlisting the partnership of Simone Torres, Kendall Hart, Liza Colby, and Mia Saunders, she creates Fusion Cosmetics. With the aid of a therapist and the encouragement of her friends, she attempts to move back into the dating scene. Trey attempts to start a relationship with her, but she is not interested. She does begin to develop romantic feelings for Fusion's handyman Carlos Reyes, who has been sending her romantic poems anonymously through the company's <b>email</b> <b>system.</b> She is able to forgive him when she learns his sister actually wrote the poems, but the relationship ends when Greenlee manipulates his friend Diane Lacey, owner of Lacey's department store, to help the company.|$|E
25|$|BlackBerry {{smartphones}} can {{be integrated}} into an organization's <b>email</b> <b>system</b> through a software package called BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) through version 5, and BlackBerry Enterprise Service (BES) as of version 10. (There were no versions 6 through 9.). Versions of BES are available for Microsoft Exchange, Lotus Domino, Novell GroupWise and Google Apps. While individual users {{may be able to}} use a wireless provider's email services without having to install BES themselves, organizations with multiple users usually run BES on their own network. BlackBerry devices running BlackBerry OS 10 or later can also be managed directly by a Microsoft Exchange Server, using Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) polices, {{in the same way that}} an iOS or Android device can. (EAS supports fewer management controls than BES does.) Some third-party companies provide hosted BES solutions. Every BlackBerry has a unique ID called a BlackBerry PIN, which is used to identify the device to the BES. BlackBerry at one time provided a free BES software called BES Express (BESX).|$|E
40|$|Security in <b>email</b> <b>systems</b> {{involves}} computationally expensive {{public key}} cryptography operations. This {{makes it difficult to}} deploy secure <b>email</b> <b>systems</b> for computationally weak environments, such as personal digital assistants. To solve this problem, we have developed a secure framework in which computationally weak clients can use a trusted server to perform difficult cryptographic operations on their behalf. As an added benefit, slight modifications to our scheme make it simple to add email security on top of older systems that do not support security...|$|R

500|$|In 2000, {{the company}} began {{negotiations}} with the employee’s union for a new contract, and during negotiations banned {{the use of the}} company <b>email</b> <b>system</b> by the union. This led to an unfair labor practice charge against the newspaper, with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruling for the paper in December 2007 that employers can ban employees' pro-union emails from the [...] company <b>email</b> <b>system.</b> The NLRB reconsidered the decision on emails on June 26, 2011, under a remand for reconsideration by the United States Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. Upon review, the NLRB agreed with the Court that the R-G violated union members' rights by changing rules. The new decision allowed Register-Guard employees to send union-related emails without restrictions. On Dec. 27, 2014, the NLRB overturned the 2007 ruling with Purple Communications, Inc., which gave union members the right to send union emails during non-work time.|$|E
2500|$|Ayyadurai {{makes the}} {{controversial}} {{claim to be}} the [...] "inventor of email". His claim is based on the software he wrote as a 14-year-old student at Livingston High School (New Jersey). In 1979—some sources say 1978—he wrote an implementation of an interoffice <b>email</b> <b>system,</b> which he called EMAIL.|$|E
2500|$|Inspector General Linick {{wrote that}} he [...] "found no {{evidence}} that staff in the Office of the Legal Adviser reviewed or approved Secretary Clinton's personal system", and also found that multiple State employees who raised concerns regarding Clinton's server {{were told that the}} Office of the Legal Adviser had approved it, and were further told to [...] "never speak of the Secretary's personal <b>email</b> <b>system</b> again".|$|E

2500|$|In May 2016, the State Department's Office of the Inspector General {{released}} an 83-page {{report about the}} State Department's email practices, including Clinton's. On July 5, 2016, Comey announced that the FBI's investigation had concluded that Clinton was [...] "extremely careless" [...] in handling her <b>email</b> <b>system</b> but recommended that no charges be filed against her. On July 6, 2016, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that no charges would be filed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, as a 14-year-old {{high school}} student, he {{attended}} a summer program at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University (NYU) to study computer programming; and then while a student at Livingston High School in New Jersey, Ayyadurai volunteered at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) where his mother worked. There he created an <b>email</b> <b>system</b> to emulate the paper-based interoffice mail system then in use at the medical school. In 1982, he registered the copyright for his software, called [...] "EMAIL", {{as well as for}} the program's user documentation.|$|E
2500|$|The move to Yahoo!Xtra Bubble caused {{trouble for}} many small {{business}} owners and website hosting companies in New Zealand. [...] Yahoo's aggressive antispam policies caused business owners to lose bookings and caused major delays for some customers in receiving emails. The Dominion Post brought the problem to the fore on 26 November 2007 and showed that responsibility for the trouble was shunned by Xtra.Xtra pushed the blame back to the hosting companies: [...] "Telecom spokesman Nick Brown denies there are technical problems with the service, and blames web-hosting companies for forwarding mail without filtering it first for spam."The problem with their denial was that Xtra/Yahoo's <b>email</b> <b>system</b> forwarded spam in the same manner.|$|E

2500|$|A {{group called}} FACE Intel (Former and Current Employees of Intel) claims that Intel weeds out older employees. FACE Intel claims {{that more than}} 90 {{percent of people who}} have been laid off or fired from Intel are over the age of 40. [...] Upside {{magazine}} requested data from Intel breaking out its hiring and firing by age, but the company declined to provide any. [...] Intel has denied that age plays any role in Intel's employment practices. [...] FACE Intel was founded by Ken Hamidi, who was fired from Intel in 1995 at the age of 47. [...] Hamidi was blocked in a 1999 court decision from using Intel's <b>email</b> <b>system</b> to distribute criticism of the company to employees, which overturned in 2003 in Intel Corp. v. Hamidi.|$|E
2500|$|The revised, second {{generation}} NeXTcube {{was released in}} 1990. Jobs touted it as the first [...] "interpersonal" [...] computer that would replace the personal computer. With its innovative NeXTMail multimedia <b>email</b> <b>system,</b> NeXTcube could share voice, image, graphics, and video in email for the first time. [...] "Interpersonal computing is going to revolutionize human communications and groupwork", Jobs told reporters. Jobs ran NeXT with an obsession for aesthetic perfection, {{as evidenced by the}} development of and attention to NeXTcube's magnesium case. This put considerable strain on NeXT's hardware division, and in 1993, after having sold only 50,000 machines, NeXT transitioned fully to software development with the release of NeXTSTEP/Intel. The company reported its first profit of $1.03million in 1994. In 1996, NeXT Software, Inc. released WebObjects, a framework for Web application development. After NeXT was acquired by Apple Inc. in 1997, WebObjects was used to build and run the Apple Store, MobileMe services, and the iTunes Store.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Haigh, a {{historian}} {{of information technology}} at the University of Wisconsin, wrote that [...] "Ayyadurai is, {{to the best of}} my knowledge, the only person to have claimed for him or herself the title 'inventor of email'." [...] Haigh argued that while EMAIL was impressive for a teenager's work, it contained no features that were not present on previous electronic mail systems and had no obvious influence on later systems. [...] "The most striking thing about Ayyadurai's claim to have invented electronic mail is how late it comes. Somehow it took him thirty years to alert the world to [...] greatest achievement". Haigh wrote that by 1980, [...] "electronic mail had been in use at MIT for 15 years, Xerox had built a modern, mouse-driven graphical <b>email</b> <b>system</b> for office communication, Compuserve was selling email access to the public, and email had for many years been the most popular application on what was soon to become the Internet." ...|$|E
