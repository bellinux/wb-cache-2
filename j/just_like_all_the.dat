While Kesha was {{in the studio with}} Dr. Luke and Blanco, she took three takes to get the song correct as she jokingly [...] "white-girl rapped" [...] over the beat. At one point in the song's production, she had wanted to re-write the verses {{of the song}} because she did not think that they were [...] "funny or clever", feeling that they [...] "kind of sucked." [...] She elaborated, [...] "I thought it was just another song, I thought it was <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other ones I'd written. I didn't even know if it was very good. I wanted to rewrite the verses, I didn't think it was funny or clever. I thought it kind of sucked. But {{everyone}} else liked it." [...] Kesha ultimately did not end up rewriting any of the song's lyrics. She further described the theme of the song in an interview, emphasizing that it embodied her own lifestyle, ...|$|E
500|$|Former {{teammate}} Andy Russell called Greene [...] "unquestionably the NFL's {{best player}} in the seventies," [...] saying [...] "No player had a greater impact or did more for his team." [...] Greene and coach Noll are widely credited with turning the Steelers franchise around. The Steelers finished 1970 with a 5–9 record and went 6–8 in 1971. Greene was invited to the Pro Bowl in both seasons. In 1972, Pittsburgh finished 11–3 and won its first division title and its first playoff game—the [...] "Immaculate Reception" [...] game against the Oakland Raiders. [...] During the season, Greene tallied eleven quarterback sacks and 42 solo tackles, and he was recognized as the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year. Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula lauded Greene, saying, [...] "He's just a super super star. It's hard to believe he isn't offside on every play. He makes the other team adjust to him." [...] By this time, Noll had built a formidable defense. [...] "We have maybe 10 guys now capable of making All-Pro," [...] said Greene in 1972. [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other guys, doing my best in a team effort." ...|$|E

John Lucas of Allmusic described the [...] "pounding electro-punk number" [...] as [...] "one {{of the most}} daring songs they've yet released," [...] while a reviewer for Newsround deemed it [...] "yet another sample of their perfect pop: bold, sassy, slightly loopy and unbelievably catchy." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC thought that [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is [...] "kinda dumb, kinda sassy, kinda pumping and kinda 'what on EARTH is THAT?', <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> best Aloud anthems are", while Nick Levine of Digital Spy rated it {{four out of five}} stars, noting that Xenomania sacrificed the [...] "conventional song structure in the name of keeping those hooks coming thick and fast - and quite right too." [...] Levine also praised Girls Aloud for restyling themselves [...] "as teasing minxes, claiming that they've 'dropped their d-d-dirty style'". Lauren Murphy of Entertainment.ie said that [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] was a [...] "stellar single", describing it as an [...] "'80s-flavoured radio hit", while Matt O'Leary of Virgin Media stated that the song [...] "slam home the power-pop message we're used to [...]" ...|$|E

If I went on, now, and took him into manhood, he would <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> one-horse men in literature and the reader would conceive a hearty contempt for him.
