40|$|The sensing and {{differentiation}} of explosive molecules is key for both security and environmental monitoring. Single fluorophores are a widely used tool for explosives detection, but a fluorescent array {{is a more}} powerful tool for detecting and differentiating such molecules. By combining array elements into a single multichannel platform, faster results {{can be obtained from}} smaller amounts of sample. Here, five explosives are detected and differentiated using quantum dots as luminescent probes in a multichannel platform: 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), tetryl (2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenylmethylnitramine), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). The sharp, variable emissions of the quantum dots, from a single excitation wavelength, make them ideal for such a system. Each color quantum dot is functionalized with a different surface receptor via a facile ligation process. These receptors undergo nonspecific interactions with the explosives, inducing variable fluorescence quenching of the quantum <b>dots.</b> <b>Pattern</b> <b>analysis</b> of the fluorescence quenching data allows for explosive detection and identification with limits-of-detection in the ppb range...|$|R

40|$|Examples of spatio-temporal {{data that}} can be {{represented}} as sets of points (called <b>dot</b> <b>patterns)</b> are pervasive in many applications, for example when tracking herds of migrating animals, ships in busy shipping channels and crowds of people in everyday life. The use {{of this type of}} data extends beyond the standard remit of Geographic Information Science (GISc), as classification and optimisation problems can often be visualised in the same manner. A common task within these fields is the assignment of a region (called a footprint) that is representative of the underlying pattern. The ways in which this footprint can be generated {{has been the subject of}} much research with many algorithms having been produced. Much of this research has focused on the <b>dot</b> <b>patterns</b> and footprints as static entities, however for many of the applications the data is prone to change. This thesis proposes that the footprint need not necessarily be updated each time the <b>dot</b> <b>pattern</b> changes; that the footprint can remain an appropriate representation of the pattern if the amount of change is slight. To ascertain the appropriate times at which to update the footprint, and when to leave it as it is, this thesis introduces the concept of change identifiers as simple measures of change between two <b>dot</b> <b>patterns.</b> Underlying the change identifiers is an in-depth examination of the data inherent in the <b>dot</b> <b>pattern</b> and the creation of descriptors that represent this data. The experimentation performed by this thesis shows that change identifiers are able to distinguish between different types of change across <b>dot</b> <b>patterns</b> from different sources.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{experiments}} three different motion discrimination tasks were studied using a random <b>dot</b> <b>pattern</b> as stimulus: velocity discrimination, direction discrimination and discrimination of opposite directions. The {{analysis of the}} motion of random <b>dot</b> <b>patterns</b> is based on motion sensitive mechanisms without the confounding interference of position sensitive mechanisms (Nakayama and Tyler, I 98 1). Furthermore, since isotropic random <b>dot</b> <b>patterns</b> contain no dominant orientation, {{a change in the}} direction of motion does not parallel a change in orientation. Hence the use of a random <b>dot</b> <b>pattern</b> as stimulus allows velocity and direction discrimination to be compared. Human velocity discrimination displays a U-shaped dependence on the stimulus velocity: the JNDs, expressed as Weber-fractions. are minimal for velocities ranging from 4 to 64 deg set-‘.

Human direction discrimination, defined as the smallest difference in direction which can be resolved, also displays a U-shaped dependence on the stimulus velocity.

40|$|It is {{debated whether}} subregions within the medial {{temporal}} lobe (MTL), {{in particular the}} hippocampus (HC) and perirhinal cortex (PrC), play domain-sensitive roles in learning. In the present study, two patients with differing degrees of MTL damage were first exposed to pairs of highly similar scenes, faces, and <b>dot</b> <b>patterns</b> and then asked to make repeated same/different decisions to preexposed and nonexposed (novel) pairs from the three categories (Experiment 1). We measured whether patients would show a benefit of prior exposure (preexposed > nonexposed) and whether repetition of nonexposed (and preexposed) pairs at test would benefit discrimination accuracy. Although selective HC damage impaired learning of scenes, but not faces and <b>dot</b> <b>patterns,</b> broader MTL damage involving the HC and PrC compromised discrimination learning of scenes and faces but left <b>dot</b> <b>pattern</b> learning unaffected. In Experiment 2, a similar task was run in healthy young participants in the MRI scanner. Functional region-of-interest analyses revealed that posterior HC and posterior parahippocampal gyrus showed greater activity during scene pattern learning, but not face and <b>dot</b> <b>pattern</b> learning, whereas PrC, anterior HC, and posterior fusiform gyrus were recruited during discrimination learning for faces, but not scenes and <b>dot</b> <b>pattern</b> learning. Critically, activity in posterior HC and PrC, but not the other functional region-of-interest analyses, was modulated by accuracy (correct > incorrect within a preferred category). Therefore, both approaches revealed a key role for the HC and PrC in discrimination learning, {{which is consistent with}} representational accounts in which subregions in these MTL structures store complex spatial and object representations, respectively...|$|R

Here, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the neural underpinnings of visual object category extraction in a cluttered visual environment. Electroencephalography (EEG) was continuously recorded while subjects were given a hybrid of an object category learning and visual search task. In this hybrid task, a peripheral array of four <b>dot</b> <b>patterns</b> was flashed. In 50 % of trials, one position of the array contained a distortion of a prototype <b>dot</b> <b>pattern.</b> The remaining trials consisted entirely of randomly generated <b>dot</b> <b>patterns.</b> After hundreds of trials, observers learned to detect the <b>dot</b> <b>pattern</b> object category via correct or incorrect feedback given on each trial.

Our results revealed a sequence of effects during the course of learning to detect the pattern. First, FRN amplitude was greatest at the beginning of learning (low d’) and then decreased over time. Following the FRN effect, a P 3 effect developed as learning continued. Finally, an N 250 effect appeared at the peak of learning (where d’ peaked), following the beginning of the P 3 effect.
