5|$|Thorium is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} and electropositive metal. With a standard reduction potential of −1.90V for the Th4+/Th couple, it is somewhat more electropositive than zirconium or aluminium. Finely divided thorium metal can exhibit pyrophoricity, spontaneously igniting <b>in</b> <b>air.</b> When heated <b>in</b> <b>air,</b> thorium turnings ignite and burn with a brilliant white light to produce the dioxide. In bulk, the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow, although corrosion may eventually occur after several months; most thorium samples are contaminated {{with varying degrees of}} the dioxide, which greatly accelerates corrosion. Such samples slowly tarnish <b>in</b> <b>air,</b> becoming grey and finally black at the surface.|$|E

Ytterbium dissolves slowly in water, but quickly in acids, liberating hydrogen gas.|$|E

5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to uranium (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust <b>in</b> <b>air</b> or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium <b>in</b> <b>air</b> is usually very small; however, {{people who work in}} factories that process phosphate fertilizers, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mg/m3. At levels of 10mg/m3, uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} a {{worldwide}} disbandment of British forts as advances <b>in</b> <b>air</b> defence systems caused them to become obsolete.

5|$|Aquatic beetles use several {{techniques}} for retaining air beneath the water's surface. Diving beetles (Dytiscidae) hold air between the abdomen and the elytra when diving. Hydrophilidae have hairs on their under surface that retain {{a layer of}} air against their bodies. Adult crawling water beetles use both their elytra and their hind coxae (the basal segment of the back legs) <b>in</b> <b>air</b> retention, while whirligig beetles simply carry an air bubble down with them whenever they dive.|$|E
5|$|As {{a powder}} {{or in the}} form of metal shavings, {{titanium}} metal poses a significant fire hazard and, when heated <b>in</b> <b>air,</b> an explosion hazard. Water and carbon dioxide are ineffective for extinguishing a titanium fire; Class D dry powder agents must be used instead.|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} ISSF events, the target for air pistol was reduced in size in 1989, also {{lowering}} the scores (although not by much), and thereby resetting all records. The development after this shows a contrast to that of air rifle shooting: whereas <b>in</b> <b>air</b> rifle the winning score of the 1989 World Championships would not have reached the final 17 years later, the same result increase has not occurred <b>in</b> <b>air</b> pistol, and Sergei Pyzhianov's world record of 593 points, set in the first World Cup Final with the new targets, remained unbeaten for almost 20 years.|$|E

5|$|Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with {{a slight}} golden shade when ultrapure. The silvery-white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon {{oxidation}} <b>in</b> <b>air</b> yielding a dark gray oxide layer. Barium has a medium specific weight and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium {{is very difficult to}} prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet.|$|E
5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage <b>in</b> <b>air</b> dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under {{the lid of the}} container, and can detonate upon opening.|$|E

5|$|Being {{a form of}} carbon, diamond oxidizes <b>in</b> <b>air</b> if heated over 700°C.

5|$|Crystalline {{zinc oxide}} is thermochromic, {{changing}} from white to yellow when heated <b>in</b> <b>air</b> and reverting to white on cooling.
