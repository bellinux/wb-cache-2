60|$|MISS WILLOUGHBY (stiffly). We {{have but}} now been advertised of your {{intention}} <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> Susan.|$|E
60|$|Sir John. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> I {{will be his}} mistress; {{he shall}} meet another Penelope than he suspects.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have got}} a special {{engagement}} <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> Mark, or I would offer {{to go with you}} and lend you a hand, if necessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, how {{you love}} me! how you love me! It is worth all I {{have gone through}} <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> <b>even</b> to wearing <b>this</b> terrible drapery." [...] And again she pointed to her shroud.|$|R
5000|$|X - [...] "Çok Ararsın Beni" [...] (There was a video filmed <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>even</b> before Kıl Oldum's, {{but it is}} rumoured that it {{was taken}} off air by Tarkan. It was the cover of Boney M's [...] "No More Chain Gang".) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>For</b> <b>this</b> reaction, <b>even</b> weak acids can be {{employed}} such as terminal acetylenes and alcohols.|$|R
6000|$|... "My name is Milton," [...] he said--"Captain Angus Milton. I am in {{the suite}} of the Archduchess <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> Her Highness {{occupies}} the box opposite to yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What about a music hall?" [...] Mr. Parker suggested. [...] "I hear there's a {{good show}} on {{right across the street}} here. Have you any {{engagement}} <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> Mr. Walmsley?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you. Then, I think, I will excuse myself <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> {{and return}} to my room. I'm {{improving}} famously, under Dr. Doyle's instructions, but am not yet a rugged example of health." ...|$|E
50|$|Brushes {{was made}} by the artists themselves. A grass type called Theli was used <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> The hair from the tails of cats and squirrels, hair from {{downside}} of deer, horses and stags, beard of cats have been used <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> <b>Even</b> camel hair sometimes. These were tied to a handle and then used. Some popular artists have been offered from golden handles from king.|$|R
5000|$|... 105 is also {{a number}} n for which [...] is prime, <b>for</b> [...] (<b>This</b> <b>even</b> works up to , {{ignoring}} the negative sign.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Maurice Willson Disher's {{review in}} The Times Literary Supplement of 16 January 1943 concluded, [...] "No crime enthusiast will object {{that the story}} of how the painter died has to be told many times, <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> <b>even</b> if it creates an {{interest}} which is more problem than plot, demonstrates the author's uncanny skill. The answer to the riddle is brilliant." ...|$|R
60|$|Count Feri, {{seeing that}} she had all but yielded, was {{preparing}} to go. Her hand was still in his, and he was pressing her slender fingers in token of a pledge <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is my own}} bad manners," [...] he explained. [...] "I {{accepted}} an invitation <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> and found {{at the last moment}} so much work that I was obliged to send an excuse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sorry," [...] he said. [...] "I {{was going}} to make a little {{suggestion}} to you <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> but my daughter here doesn't fall in with it. They will have their own way--these girls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What can I do <b>for</b> you <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> Mr. Cuthbert?" [...] Miss Lucilla Harris inquired, briskly and ingratiatingly, {{tapping the}} counter with both hands.|$|R
60|$|But Juliette {{understood}} Merlin's attitude, and {{guessed that}} her written denunciation {{had come into}} his hands. Her every thought, every living sensation within her, was centred in this one thing: to save the man she loved {{from the consequences of}} her own crime against him. And <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> <b>even</b> the shadow of suspicion must be removed from him. Merlin's iniquitous law should not touch him again.|$|R
50|$|Reflectors, {{including}} umbrellas, flat-white backgrounds, drapes and reflector {{cards are}} commonly used <b>for</b> <b>this</b> purpose (<b>even</b> with small hand-held flash units).|$|R
60|$|Quentin {{excused himself}} <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> under pretence of a severe headache, which {{the open air}} was likely to prove the best cure for, and at length the well meaning, priest left him to himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{take it as}} a {{kindness}} if, <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> {{you don't}} mention that you have happened to meet me," [...] Ransom remarked, after a little. He had changed his mind about giving notice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your cousin is charming, Jesson," [...] he said. [...] "I'll {{never be}} able to thank you enough <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> For the first time I have felt that after all there may be a chance for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is lucky}} that you bought some grain <b>for</b> them, <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> {{instead of waiting}} till the morning, so {{they can have a}} good feed before starting." ...|$|R
50|$|Since {{there is}} no genetic {{consensus}} for the diagnosis of KS and CHH, and mild clinical forms can be overlooked, it does make finding a reliable figure for the prevalence of the disease difficult. It {{is believed to be}} between four and five times more common in males than females, but there is so far no obvious genetic reason <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> <b>even</b> though two of the associated gene defects occur on the X-chromosome.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear boy, don't blame {{yourself}} for anything. You acted nobly," [...] the Babe told him. [...] "She's {{coming here to}} call <b>for</b> me <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> on purpose to thank you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Permit her {{to neglect}} the {{embroidery}} <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> I wish her whole attention {{to be fixed}} on my accent; and to ensure this, she must follow the reading with her eyes--she must look at the book." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{felt that}} the poor child's secret was safe <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> at least; for I {{believed}} Mrs. Wilbur too wily to acknowledge her rival at present. The woman of the world still hoped to distance the Spanish child.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does {{it really}} matter?" [...] Wrayson asked. [...] "It is only <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> I shall leave for London tomorrow, in any event. Besides, {{it is part}} of the bargain that we take coffee with these ladies. Here they are." ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{obtained}} the position-momentum uncertainties and some uncertainty {{relations for the}} Pöschl-Teller-type potential for any ℓ. The radial expectation values of r^- 2, r^ 2 and p^ 2 are obtained from which the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle holds for the potential model under consideration. The Fisher information is then obtained and {{it is observed that}} the Fisher-information-based uncertainty relation and the Cramer-Rao inequality hold <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>even</b> power potential. Some numerical and graphical results are displayed...|$|R
6000|$|... "Job," [...] said Mrs. Thornberry, [...] "I {{have made}} two engagements <b>for</b> you <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> First, {{we will go}} and see your father, and then we are to drink tea at the rectory." ...|$|R
60|$|Peter {{could always}} {{do with a}} {{sandwich}} or two these days. But {{he was prepared to}} abandon them joyfully if his hostess would waive bridge <b>for</b> <b>this</b> particular <b>evening.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He must be {{on board}} before gunfire, Mrs. O'Halloran, unless you get a special order from the town major. I was obliged to get one, myself, <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> The orders are strict, now; all the gates are closed at gunfire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been trying}} to chin that old fool of a squire into letting you off <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> so's we can give a show, but he won't listen to {{anything}} of the kind," [...] the visitor announced in a disconsolate tone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, Tuppence," [...] he began, [...] "will {{you do me}} a good turn? Take this, and get Jane {{regularly}} togged up <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> You're {{all coming}} to supper with me at the Savoy. See? Spare no expense. You get me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They don't {{have private}} views in Asia, I suppose," [...] he laughed. [...] "But what a pity that <b>for</b> <b>this</b> year, <b>even</b> in <b>this</b> gorged city, they're pretty well over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{we are in}} Grosvenor Square," [...] the Prince answered. [...] "I {{forgot to}} tell you that we have a meeting {{arranged}} <b>for</b> here <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> Permit me." [...] But Lucille resumed her seat in the carriage.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If it was {{possible}} to divine any cause <b>for</b> <b>this</b> merriment, <b>even</b> the most remote,' he said, 'I should not reprove you. But when you can have none whatever--oh, really, really!' ...|$|R
