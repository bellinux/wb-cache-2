5|$|Upon release, {{the song}} was a respectable success on the charts and became the fourth top ten <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> album on the Billboard Hot 100. Despite its success, the single {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics who praised its composition, linking it to the works by Coldplay, but criticized its production and Levine's vocals. Following {{the release of the}} album, due to strong digital downloads, the song peaked at number nine on the singles chart in South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Anita {{maintained}} its strength as it approached land, and at 1100 UTC on September 2 it made landfall on Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas, about 145 miles (235 km) south of Brownsville, Texas or 80 miles (130 km) north of Tampico, Mexico. Moving ashore with a pressure of 926 mbar, Anita {{was the third}} most intense tropical cyclone to strike the nation, and was the most intense hurricane to <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico. It rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, and on September 3, about 25 hours after moving ashore, Anita emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression. Reclassified as Tropical Depression Eleven, the system continued to the west, and weakened further after encountering cooler water temperatures. The depression gradually lost its deep convection, and on September 4 it dissipated off of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The 1899 New Richmond Tornado was an {{estimated}} EF5 tornado which formed {{on the early}} evening of June 12, 1899 and tore a 45-mile long path of destruction through St. Croix, Polk and Barron counties in west-central Wisconsin, leaving 117 people dead, twice as many injured and hundreds homeless. The worst devastation wrought by the tornado was at the city of New Richmond, Wisconsin, which took a direct <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm. Over half the town was left in ruins by the tornado, which also caused lesser damage to several other communities in the area. More than $300,000 (USD) ($ in today's dollars) in damage was reported. Today, it ranks as the ninth deadliest tornado in United States history, {{as well as the}} deadliest ever recorded in Wisconsin.|$|E

5|$|Through late September, Caltech seismometers {{recorded}} 188 aftershocks {{higher than}} magnitude 4.0. Six {{of those on}} the day of the mainshock were M5 and above, but some of these (like the 12:05 M6.3 shock) were only felt, and didn't cause any damage. The July 21 M5.1 shock at 15:13 GMT and the July 23 shock at 00:38 both damaged buildings in Arvin, and the latter event also caused slight damage in Fresno and near Bakersfield. Three additional shocks on July 23 were particularly destructive. Walls and other portions of buildings that had been previously damaged took a second <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 07:53 M5.2 event, and a house that saw only minor damage during the mainshock was nearly destroyed by it. Gas and water lines were also severed, and transformers were loosened or dislodged. The 13:17 M5.8 shock compounded problems at Tehachapi and Arvin with damage to previously-affected buildings that was described as serious, but the 18:13 shock on July 23 only had a slight affect at Arvin.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a hurricane, Emily was centered roughly 1,000mi (1,600km) {{east of the}} Florida peninsula, passing well south of Bermuda. A ridge of high pressure began to mature to its north, forcing the hurricane westward on August27. Emily's winds vacillated between tropical storm and hurricane force {{over the course of}} the day, although the cyclone resumed its strengthening by August28 upon developing favorable upper-level outflow. Traversing warm sea surface temperatures, the hurricane continued to improve in appearance on satellite images, and the barometric pressure within its eye steadily decreased. Emily retraced toward the northwest on August29, when a shortwave trough eroded the southern periphery of the contiguous ridge. The NHC expressed uncertainty in forecasting Emily's track, stating that South Carolina, North Carolina, and Mid-Atlantic states were at risk of a direct <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hurricane. As high pressure re-established itself off the North Carolina coast, Emily briefly turned west-northwestward on August30 before initiating a prolonged curve toward the north. By that time, the NHC forecast Emily to remain offshore, though one tropical cyclone forecast model projected that the hurricane would move inland.|$|E
5|$|The tornado became violent as {{it entered}} Cullman, being tracked and {{broadcast}} live via several tower cameras, including one operated by ABC 33/40 for several minutes; that camera captured {{the destruction of}} a communications tower belonging to Cullman area low-power television station WCQT-LP as the tornado ripped through the city. Radio stations in downtown Cullman also reported on the tornado and some even captured it passing over until power was knocked out. Downtown Cullman was badly damaged by the tornado, with the major damage being along a two-block area {{through the center of the}} downtown business district. Numerous well-built brick buildings and storefronts in downtown Cullman were heavily damaged or completely destroyed, along with multiple churches. The courthouse and nearby emergency management building took a direct <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tornado, sustaining considerable damage, and two school buildings were heavily damaged as well. Many well-known businesses, such as Vincent's Furniture, The Cullman Times, and the Busy Bee Cafe, were also severely damaged/destroyed. Many homes were damaged or destroyed in residential areas of the city, with extensive tree and power line damage noted as well. In all, a total of 867 residences and 94 businesses within the city of Cullman were damaged or destroyed.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, Nintendo led the video game industry with its Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Although the NES follow-up console, the Super NES (SNES), was successful, sales took a <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Japanese recession. Competition from long-time rival Sega, and relative newcomer Sony, emphasized Nintendo's need to develop a successor for the SNES, or risk losing market dominance to its competitors. Further complicating matters, Nintendo also faced a backlash from third-party developers unhappy with Nintendo's strict licensing policies.|$|E
25|$|Fountain was {{the first}} {{baseball}} player {{to be used as}} a Specialist Fielding Coach by any test level cricket team when he was hired in 1998 by the West Indies to coach on their tour of South Africa. On the 2000/01 West Indies tour of Australia he took to the field as substitute fielder for the West Indies against the Prime Ministers eleven at the Manuka Oval in Canberra. He rose to the challenge by running out Anthony McQuire with a direct <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> boundary.|$|E
25|$|This {{tour was}} a {{particularly}} tough one for the West Indies, where they struggled in most departments, however the fielding continued to improve {{under the guidance of}} Fountain.

He rose to the challenge by running out Anthony McGuire with a direct <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> boundary.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914 the Fort de Suarlée was {{under the command of}} Captain-Commandant Moisse, with about 400 artillerymen and 80 {{fortress}} troops. The fort was bombarded by invading German forces beginning on 23 August 1914. The Germans did not bother with infantry assault at the Namur forts as had been tried at Liège, at a heavy cost, preferring to batter the Namur positions with artillery. The Namur forts fell quickly. On the 24th the fort was hit by about 1500 heavy projectiles, causing significant damage. On the 25th Suarlée was <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rear by another 1500 210mm, 305mm and 420mm shells, nearly destroying the fort and resulting in its surrender that day.|$|E
25|$|On 26 April 2009, {{the unified}} Pakistan Armed Forces started the {{strategic}} and tactical airborne attack, codename Black Thunderstorm, {{with the aim}} of retaking Buner, Lower Dir, Swat and Shangla districts from the TTP. This joint armynavy- air force unified operation was well rehearsed and prepared. The fighter jets of Navy and air force began pounding the militant hideouts while army kept advancing in the militant hideouts. The combat fighter pilots of the navy and air force flew their aerial bombing mission together in high altitude at continuous 24-hour period, to avoid being <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> anti-aircraft guns. During the initial stages of the unified operations, the ground troops and paratroopers performed combat HALO/HAHO techniques to hold the control of high strategic mountains and hills surrounding the Taliban-controlled cities.|$|E
25|$|Former NFL coach Tony Dungy {{later told}} Profootballtalk.com {{he was certain}} that Williams {{operated}} a similar bounty system while he was defensive coordinator of the Oilers/Titans from 1997 to 2000. He also believes that Williams put a bounty on Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning during Super Bowl XLIV, and targeted Manning on several occasions while with the Titans. The revelation of the bounty system also caused renewed speculation about a 2006 game between the Redskins and Colts, in which Manning was knocked down by a high-low <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Redskins' Phillip Daniels and Andre Carter and appeared to lose some feeling in his neck. While Dungy didn't speculate at the time about whether the Redskins targeted Manning on that play, he believes that hit ultimately caused the neck problems that sidelined Manning for the entire 2011 season and led to his departure for the Denver Broncos afterward.|$|E
