5|$|Despite the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall beginning in 1961, which increased tensions between East and West, Brundage was successful in securing a joint German team for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Nevertheless, the East Germans, supported by IOC members from Warsaw Pact nations, aspired to have their own team. They made a major breakthrough when the IAAF (led by the Marquess of Exeter, the former Lord Burghley) recognized a separate East German team beginning with the 1966 European Athletics Championships. The East Germans did their best to get Brundage's support, and, at the IOC session at Mexico City in 1968, they were granted <b>full</b> <b>membership,</b> with their own team under their own flag, which they displayed on West German soil four years later at the Opening Ceremony at Munich. Brundage, while finally supporting <b>full</b> <b>membership</b> for East Germany, considered the matter a defeat for Olympic ideals.|$|E

5|$|After the Sejny Uprising, a Polish {{revolt against}} the Lithuanian {{authorities}} {{in one of the}} disputed border regions, Lithuanian intelligence intensified its investigation of the Polish minority and sympathizers in Lithuania, and uncovered the planned coup. The Lithuanians, not knowing the membership of the PMO, arrested numerous Polish activists and destabilized the PMO network enough to prevent the coup attempt. Later the <b>full</b> <b>membership</b> list was obtained and the PMO in Lithuania was dissolved. The coup further strained Polish–Lithuanian relations.|$|E

40|$|As time continues, {{the issue}} of <b>full</b> European Union <b>membership</b> for Norway becomes a more {{pertinent}} issue. The EU has long awaited the membership of Norway, but unfortunately the Nordic country has decided to remain independent. Norway’s historical past has led many Norwegians to believe their country is not ready for full integration. Another union would be too soon considering Norway was under foreign domination for 500 years and just gained its independence only a century ago. Norway rejected <b>full</b> EU <b>membership</b> in 1972 and 1994. The objective {{of this research was}} to formulate a hypothesis of how Norway would vote if a “ 2006 Referendum” on <b>full</b> EU <b>membership</b> were to occur, as well as understand and explain Norwegians’ current concerns and benefits relative to <b>full</b> EU <b>membership.</b> Norwegians have voiced strong concern to protect its wealth generated from the extensive petroleum resources, the historical fishing sector, exclusivity of its waters, and the agricultural subsidies. Other Norwegians see <b>full</b> EU <b>membership</b> as a way to access a larger market, achieve a vote and voice in EU policies, and develop a long term future for Norway. As a result of this Norwegian opinion survey, it can be concluded that, even though Norwegians currently voiced an in favor stance, Norway will not accept <b>full</b> EU <b>membership</b> for another ten to fifteen years...|$|R

5|$|As part of post-Cold War restructuring, NATO's {{military}} {{structure was}} cut back and reorganized, with new forces {{such as the}} Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established. The changes {{brought about by the}} collapse of the Soviet Union on the military balance in Europe were recognized in the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which was signed in 1999. The policies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to <b>full</b> <b>membership</b> on 4April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.|$|E

5|$|In 1918, Molotov {{was sent}} to Ukraine {{to take part in}} the civil war then {{breaking}} out. Since he was not a military man, he took no part in the fighting.

5|$|A {{member of}} the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was a {{member of the}} nomenklatura, the country's de facto ruling class. Nikita Khrushchev chaired the Presidium from 1955 to 1964; Leonid Brezhnev succeeded him that year and chaired until 1982. In {{contrast}} to full members, candidate members of the Presidium could not vote during Presidium sessions. It was normal that a full member of the Presidium had previously served as a candidate member, but this was not always the case. During the term 23 people held seats in the Presidium: 14 full members and 9 candidate members. One candidate member was promoted to <b>full</b> <b>membership</b> in the Presidium during the term. Not a single Presidium member died during this period while retaining office.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert surveils Watts, {{finding that}} the latter has {{been in contact with}} Means. Black travels to where Means is living, where he {{remotely}} observes a cult-like ceremony in which Means is ritually inducted into the Group.

Black warns Watts that the Group is dangerous; Watts neither confirms nor denies this, but predicts the arrival of an earthquake, urging Black that should this prediction come to pass, he should accept <b>full</b> <b>membership</b> of the Group. That night, Black answers a telephone call from Means, who tells him that the Group mean no harm. The line suddenly cuts, and the tremors of an earthquake begin just as Watts had predicted. Black moves through his home, noticing that his pet bird is dead in its cage, covered in blood.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} its {{traditional}} Western orientation, relations with Europe {{have always been}} a central part of Turkish foreign policy. Turkey {{became one of the first}} members of the Council of Europe in 1949, applied for associate membership of the EEC (predecessor of the European Union) in 1959 and became an associate member in 1963. After decades of political negotiations, Turkey applied for <b>full</b> <b>membership</b> of the EEC in 1987, became an associate member of the Western European Union in 1992, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and has been in formal accession negotiations with the EU since 2005. Today, EU membership is considered as a state policy and a strategic target by Turkey. Turkey's support for Northern Cyprus in the Cyprus dispute complicates Turkey's relations with the EU and remains a major stumbling block to the country's EU accession bid.|$|E
5|$|Marshal Zhukov {{was rewarded}} for his support with <b>full</b> <b>membership</b> in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his {{popularity}} and power.

Zhukov learned what was happening, and hurried back to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov's defense. Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power by arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the Gosbank) and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief. Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's absolute power.|$|E
