5|$|Ruthenium trichloride is a {{well-known}} compound, existing in a black α-form and a dark brown β-form: the trihydrate is red. Of the known trihalides, trifluoride is dark brown and <b>decomposes</b> above 650°C, tetrabromide is dark-brown and <b>decomposes</b> above 400°C, and triiodide is black. Of the dihalides, difluoride is not known, dichloride is brown, dibromide is black, and diiodide is blue. The only known oxyhalide is the pale green ruthenium(VI) oxyfluoride, RuOF4.|$|E
5|$|Few {{inorganic}} lead(IV) compounds are known, {{and these}} exist only in highly acidic solutions. Lead(II) oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation, Pb3O4. It {{is described as}} lead(II,IV) oxide, or structurally 2PbO·PbO2, and is the best-known mixed valence lead compound. Lead dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas. This is because the expected PbCl4 that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously <b>decomposes</b> to PbCl2 and Cl2. Analogously to lead monoxide, lead dioxide is capable of forming plumbate anions. Lead disulfide and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures. Lead tetrafluoride, a yellow crystalline powder, is stable, but less so than the difluoride. Lead tetrachloride (a yellow oil) <b>decomposes</b> at room temperature, lead tetrabromide is less stable still, {{and the existence of}} lead tetraiodide is questionable.|$|E
5|$|Indium(I) {{compounds}} are not common. The chloride, bromide, and iodide {{are deeply}} colored, unlike the parent trihalides {{from which they}} are prepared.

The <b>Decompose</b> 2 and Compose 2 procedures conduct Equations (5) and (6), respectively. The <b>Decompose</b> 4 and Compose 4 may either recursively call the <b>Decompose</b> 2 and Compose 2, respectively, or they may directly split the data into four parts and reconstruct back from the four parts, respectively.

5|$|Protactinium oxides are basic; they easily {{convert to}} {{hydroxides}} and can form various salts, such as sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, etc. The nitrate is usually white {{but can be}} brown due to radiolytic decomposition. Heating the nitrate in air at 400°C converts it to the white protactinium pentoxide. The polytrioxophosphate Pa(PO3)4 can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate PaF2SO4 with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) under inert gas atmosphere. Heating the product to about 900°C eliminates the reaction by-products such as hydrofluoric acid, sulfur trioxide and phosphoric anhydride. Heating to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere <b>decomposes</b> Pa(PO3)4 into the diphosphate PaP2O7, which is analogous to diphosphates of other actinides. In the diphosphate, the PO3 groups form pyramids of C2v symmetry. Heating PaP2O7 in air to 1400°C <b>decomposes</b> it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and protactinium.|$|E

40|$|In {{the area}} of process mining, <b>decomposed</b> replay has been {{proposed}} {{to be able to}} deal with nets and logs containing many different activities. The main assumption behind this decomposition is that replaying many subnets and sublogs containing only some activities is faster then replaying a single net and log containing many activities. Although for many nets and logs this assumption does hold, there are also nets and logs for which it does not hold. This paper shows an example net and log for which the <b>decomposed</b> replay may take way more time, and provides an explanation why this is the case. Next, to mitigate this problem, this paper proposes an alternative <b>decomposed</b> replay, and shows that this alternative <b>decomposed</b> replay is faster than the monolithic replay even for the problematic cases as identified earlier. owever, the alternative <b>decomposed</b> replay is often slower than the original <b>decomposed</b> approach.

5|$|Silver {{and gold}} have rather low {{chemical}} affinities for oxygen, lower than copper, {{and it is}} therefore expected that silver oxides are thermally quite unstable. Soluble silver(I) salts precipitate dark-brown silver(I) oxide, Ag2O, upon the addition of alkali. (The hydroxide AgOH exists only in solution; otherwise it spontaneously <b>decomposes</b> to the oxide.) Silver(I) oxide is very easily reduced to metallic silver, and <b>decomposes</b> to silver and oxygen above 160°C. This and other silver(I) compounds may be oxidized by the strong oxidizing agent peroxodisulfate to black AgO, a mixed silver(I,III) oxide of formula AgIAgIIIO2. Some other mixed oxides with silver in non-integral oxidation states, namely Ag2O3 and Ag3O4, are also known, as is Ag3O which behaves as a metallic conductor.|$|E

Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60°C, <b>decomposes</b> at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in a vacuum. It oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, it gives the hypobromite anion.|$|E
5|$|For a few limited {{purposes}} {{when it is}} needed, {{pure iron}} is produced in the laboratory in small quantities by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen, or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250°C so that it <b>decomposes</b> to form pure iron powder.

Some mixed-valence compounds are also known, such as Tl4O3 and TlCl2, which contain both thallium(I) and thallium(III).

5|$|Although {{the concern}} for a thiomersal-autism link was {{originally}} derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated. Ethylmercury, such as in thiomersal, clears much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury, suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also <b>decomposes</b> quicker in the brain than methylmercury, suggesting a lower risk of brain damage. These findings show that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based on direct comparison to methylmercury, were flawed.|$|E
5|$|Although usually trivalent, {{ytterbium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual for lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion {{is a very strong}} reducing agent and <b>decomposes</b> water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 state, but europium(II) is stable in aqueous solution.

It is isotypic with the better-known analogous uranium compound uranocene. It can be prepared by reacting K2C8H8 with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at the temperature of dry ice, or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with MgC8H8. It is unstable in air and <b>decomposes</b> in water or at 190°C.

Octaphenylrhodocene (a derivative with eight phenyl groups attached) was the first substituted rhodocene to be isolated at room temperature, though it <b>decomposes</b> rapidly in air. X-ray crystallography confirmed that octaphenylrhodocene has a sandwich structure with a staggered conformation.
