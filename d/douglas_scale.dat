50|$|The <b>Douglas</b> Sea <b>Scale</b> is a scale which {{measures}} {{the height of}} the waves and also measures the swell of the sea. The scale is very simple to follow and is expressed in one of 10 degrees.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Douglas</b> sea <b>scale,</b> {{also called}} the [...] "international sea and swell scale", was devised in the 1920s by Captain H.P. Douglas, who later became vice admiral Sir Percy Douglas and {{hydrographer}} of the Royal Navy. Its purpose is to estimate the roughness of the sea for navigation. The scale has two codes: one code is for estimating the sea state, the other code is for describing the swell of the sea.|$|R
5000|$|After the war Douglas {{served as}} Assistant Hydrographer of the Navy 1919-21, then {{commanded}} [...] 1921-23 and, briefly, [...] in 1924 for surveys in British Guiana and the West Indies. He was appointed Hydrographer of the Navy in October 1924. About {{this time he}} devised the <b>Douglas</b> Sea <b>Scale.</b> He was promoted to Rear-Admiral in 1927. In 1929, after the normal five years as Hydrographer, he was offered an extension of three years and accepted it on condition of being placed on the Retired List. He was promoted to vice-admiral in 1931. From 1928 to 1932 he was the Navy's representative on the Discovery Committee for exploration in Antarctica.|$|R
40|$|Here, we {{show through}} a {{statistical}} analysis that rogue waves in broadband non-breaking seas are spatially asymmetric. In {{addition to the}} top-down asymmetry due to nonlinear effects, we show that the two troughs adjacent to the rogue wave crest are generally of different depths, which is unlike the conventional picture of rogue waves with symmetric fore and aft troughs often obtained from model equations. The rogue-wave trough asymmetry is demonstrated for sea states 4 to 6 on <b>Douglas</b> Sea <b>Scale.</b> Considering the deepest trough leads to approximately 10 % increase in the calculation of the mean rogue-wave height compared to previous results for rogue waves reported with symmetric troughs. This implies that estimates of rogue-wave trough-crest amplitudes based on model equations should be re-assessed upward for all realistic oceanic conditions...|$|R

5000|$|Networked Improvement Communities {{are another}} form of Improvement Science.  Douglas Engelbart {{originally}} coined the term [...] "Network Improvement Community" [...] in relation to {{his work in the}} software and engineering field as network of human and technical resources to enable the community to get better at getting better.  Anthony Bryk and his team have defined Networked Improvement Communities as social arrangements that involve individuals from many different contexts working together with a common interest in achieving common goals to surface and test new ideas across varied contexts to enhance design at <b>scale.</b> <b>Douglas</b> Engelbart sees three levels of human and technical resources that need to work together: on the ground practitioners, organizational level structures and resources to support the data collection and analysis of practitioners, and inter-institutional resources to share, adapt, and expand on information learned across varied contexts.  In education, these communities are problem-centered and link academic research, clinical practice, and local expertise to focus on implementation and adaptation for context.|$|R
