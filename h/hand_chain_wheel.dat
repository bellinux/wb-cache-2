40|$|Abstract. Recent years due to {{the rise}} of {{awareness}} of environmental protection and energy conservation are attention. Which is the most representative of the bike. Many processing factors must be controlled in the bicycle <b>chain</b> <b>wheel.</b> This study employed the rigid-plastic finite element (FE) DEFORM TM 3 D software to investigate the plastic deformation behavior of an aluminum alloy workpiece as it is forged for bicycle <b>chain</b> <b>wheels.</b> Factors include the temperature of the forging billet, shear friction factor, temperature of die and punch speed control all parameters. Moreover, this study used the Taguchi method and Genetic algorithm neural networks to determine the most favorable optimization parameters. Finally, our results confirmed the suitability of the proposed design, which enabled a bicycle <b>chain</b> <b>wheel</b> die to achieve perfect forging during finite element testing...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} the wear tests of <b>chain</b> <b>wheels</b> made of austempered ductile iron with various content of residual austenite. The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate the impact of the dynamic surface treatment (shot peening) on wear properties of surface layers of the <b>chain</b> <b>wheels</b> tested that were subjected to the action of quartz abrasive. Apart from determining the value of the abrasive wear, examinations of the magnetic phase content in the microstructure were carried out and plots of hardness of the surface layer as a function of the distance from the surface and microstructure of the materials were prepared. Based on the results, the following was found: an increase in the abrasive wear and a reduction in the hardness of the surface layer of <b>chain</b> <b>wheels</b> subjected to shot peening, as well as reduction of susceptibility to negative action of the shot for cast irons with the structure of upper ausferrite...|$|R
40|$|The {{profile of}} <b>chain</b> <b>wheels</b> front teeth {{throughout}} paper work {{is presented in}} two different directions, the front profile resulting from the calculations for determining the <b>chain</b> <b>wheel</b> geometry and the other direction represent the same profile (manufactured on gear hobbing machine ???FD 500 ??? - UM Cugir Rom??nia) verified in coordinate of measuring on machine "Smart CMM" - Wenzel UK. The stages of analyzing both profiles are represented by chain transmission calculation, manufacturing technology, measuring teeth front profile of <b>chain</b> <b>wheel</b> and comparison of front profile resulting from the calculations, with the same machined profile (and measured in coordinates). Conclusions shows there a rate error read, which {{may be due to the}} person who measured, with the current method of manually positioning the probe with the joystick; for a better determination of the dimensions it's recommended introducing in software memory "Smart CMM", drawing of sprocket (in our case), for full analogue scanning probe to determining deviations from nominal dimensions; The Coordinate Measuring Machine ???Smart CMM???, by the flexibility and precision it offers, can be used for determining geometrical characteristics of chain wheels; from measurements made with success was observed errors of manufacturing at sprocket studie...|$|R
5000|$|De Vivie {{imported}} machines from England. In 1889 {{he made a}} bike of his own, called La Gauloise. It had {{a diamond}} frame, chain and a single gear. De Vivie was riding the col de la République (10 km south east of St Etienne) in 1889 {{when one of his}} readers overtook him - smoking a pipe. De Vivie felt challenged but also trapped: if he lowered his gear, he would go slower on the flat. But on the gearing that he had, he could not climb hills fast enough either. British thinking favoured epicyclic and planetary gears, concealed in the rear hub. De Vivie created the derailleur. His first had two chain wheels; the chain had to be lifted by hand from one to the other. He then placed two <b>chain</b> <b>wheels</b> on the left side. The combination gave him four gears. [...] In 1901 Velocio combined his invention with the four-speed proteon gear of the English Whippet, which used a split <b>chain</b> <b>wheel.</b> Pedalling backwards made the two halves of the <b>chain</b> <b>wheel</b> open. Pawls then secured them in one of four positions. De Vivie's development appeared in his Cheminot in 1906, the first derailleur. He overlooked taking out a patent and made barely any money from an invention which changed cycling.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of sintered timing wheel {{in contact with}} <b>chain</b> <b>wheels</b> were analysed using Finite Element Methods (FEM), in which the timing wheel is modelled as a metal powder. The {{mechanical properties}} of sintered timing wheel were investigated {{as a function of}} sintered density. Tensile strength and Young’s modulus increased with a decrease in porosity. Current methods of calculating gear contact stresses use Hertz’s equations, which were originally derived for contact between sintered timing <b>wheel</b> and <b>chain</b> <b>wheels.</b> The results of the 2 D dimensional FEM analyses from ANSYS are presented. The relationship between relative density of P/M steels and mechanical behavior is also obtained from FEM and compared with the experimental data. Good agreement between the experimental and FEM results is observed, which demonstrates that FEM can capture the major features of the P/M steels behaviour during loading. This indicates that the FEM model is accurate...|$|R

According {{to the results of}} the multi-body dynamics simulation, structural static analysis on sprocket wheel in dangerous conditions were executed by ANSYS Workbench. The results showed that there are three bearing situations in the meshing transmission process of sprocket wheel and chain: Single tooth bearing, two tooth bearing and carrying equal contact force and two tooth bearing but one tooth contact force reaches the maximum value. The equivalent stress value at the contact position of sprocket <b>wheel</b> and <b>chain</b> exceeds the yield stress of the <b>chain</b> <b>wheel</b> material, but it does not cause damage to <b>chain</b> <b>wheel.</b> In addition to the contact location, the equivalent stress value of the remaining parts of sprocket wheel are in the allowable stress range of sprocket wheel material, comply with the requirement of strength design...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of wear tests obtained for 4 groups of materials: surface-hardened alloy steels and alloy cast steels for structural applications, hard-wearing surface-hardened alloy cast steels, and austempered alloy cast irons. The wear tests have been performed on a specially designed test rig that allows reproducing the real operating conditions of <b>chain</b> <b>wheels,</b> including the rolling and sliding form of contact between elements. The <b>chain</b> <b>wheels</b> subjected to tests were operated with the use of loose quartz abrasive. This study presents results of measurements of material parameters, micro-structure of a surface subject to wear, as well as the linear wear determined for the materials considered. Based on the results, the following was found: the best wear properties were obtained for surface-hardened alloy steels and wear surface; strengthening of the ADI surface took place - most probably as a result of transformation of austenite into martensite; the uniformity {{of the structure of the}} materials affects the surface wear process. The study also indicated a significant degree of graphite deformation in ADI characterized by the upper ausferritic structure and its oblique orientation in relation to the surface, which resulted in a facilitated degradation of the surface caused by the quartz abrasive...|$|R

40|$|Many logging {{operators}} in Finland use bogie tracks and <b>wheel</b> <b>chains</b> all the year round and under all terrain conditions. The hypothesis tested {{here is that}} bogie tracks and <b>wheel</b> <b>chains</b> increase the resistance forces, and thus fuel consumption, when operating in summer conditions and on a hard-earth forest floor. Fuel consumption was measured under such conditions using the CAN bus and GPS techniques and models were generated to simulate it in different forms of terrain and types of logging work. It was found that both <b>wheel</b> <b>chains</b> and bogie tracks increased fuel consumption under all simulated terrain conditions, the difference being quite marginal for <b>wheel</b> <b>chains,</b> but much more significant for bogie tracks. A site size of 5 hectares was the break-even value reached in {{three out of four}} simulated terrain types that made the removal and re-installation of bogie tracks profitable when the average extraction distance was more than 600 metres...|$|R
