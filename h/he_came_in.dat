5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, {{even though he had}} not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order.

He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.|$|E

5|$|Although {{trained as}} a lawyer, Carmelo began fencing at an early age, {{beginning}} in the 1910s, {{at the behest of}} his father and, much like his father, specialized in épée, while also being proficient at fleuret.

In the next two years, he finished at the top in both events and became nationally known.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 195455 season, along with Neil, Ray was called into an Australian XI for a Test trial against Len Hutton’s touring English team, the closest that two Harveys came to playing in a Test for Australia together.

Ray was selected for all six of Victoria’s matches and played in all of these matches alongside Neil, as the domestic season was shortened and there were no scheduling clashes between the Tests and the domestic matches. Mick also played in all of Queensland's matches, and three brothers met in their states’ only meeting for the season.|$|E

5|$|During his {{period in}} Berlin, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> contact with and was greatly {{influenced}} by Friedrich Carl von Savigny, Alexander von Humboldt, Eduard Gans, and especially Professor Leopold von Ranke, whose ideas on the necessity for politicians {{to be acquainted with}} historical science he readily adopted. In pages he dedicated to the influence exercised by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel on Romanian thought, Tudor Vianu noted that certain Hegelian-related principles were a common attribute of the Berlin faculty during Kogălniceanu's stay. He commented that, in later years, the politician adopted views which resonated with those of Hegel, most notably the principle that legislation needed to adapt to the individual spirit of nations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} between graduating from Marlborough College and {{going up to}} Oxford University, Seamer made his county cricket debut, playing three matches for Somerset County Cricket Club. In his first match for Somerset, played against Derbyshire, he played as a {{specialist}} batsman at number eight in the batting order. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> to bat when Somerset had lost six wickets for the addition of 88 runs, and together with his captain, Reggie Ingle, helped Somerset to recover. The pair put on a partnership of 104 runs, and Seamer scored 70 runs in his debut innings. In both his other matches for the county that season, Seamer batted {{as part of the}} top order, and though he reached double figures in each of his innings, he did not achieve another half-century.|$|E
5|$|King Haco sailed {{afterwards}} {{south to}} Guðey before Kintyre where he anchored. There King John met him; <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> the ship with Bishop Thorgil. King Haco desired {{him to follow}} his banner as he should do. But King John excused himself. He said he had sworn an oath to the Scottish King, and held of him more lands than of the Norwegian Monarch; he therefore entreated King Haco to dispose of all those estates which he had conferred upon him. King Haco kept him with him some time, and endeavoured to incline his mind to fidelity. Many laid imputations to his charge. King Haco indeed had before received bad accounts of him from the Hebrides; for John Langlife-son came to the King, while he was sailing west from Shetland, and told him the news that John King of the Hebrides, breaking his faith, had turned to the Scottish Monarch. King Haco, however, would not believe this till he had found it so.|$|E
