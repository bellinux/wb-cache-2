500|$|Takechi's next film, Courtesan (Oiran, 1983), {{like his}} Daydream films, {{was based on}} a Tanizaki novel. Three studios were {{involved}} in the production: Fujii Movies, Ogawa Productions, and Takechi Film. The film is set {{at the end of the}} 19th century, and tells the story of a Yokohama prostitute who services American sailors. The woman is possessed by the spirit of her dead lover, who, in erotic scenes echoing The Exorcist (1973), makes his presence known whenever she is sexually aroused. Because of the large budget involved in the production, the distributing studio submitted Courtesan to Eirin repeatedly, and agreed to every cut the reviewing board recommended. The <b>heavy</b> <b>cutting</b> the film received reduced it from near-hardcore to a very softcore historical drama. Takechi again took advantage of the situation to fight Eirin, and complained publicly about the censorship. When he noticed that the censors had painted over a penis with colors, he ridiculed them by promoting his film with the line, [...] "See the first multicolored penis in Japanese Cinema!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Metal cutting [...] generates heat due to {{friction}} and energy lost deforming the material. The surrounding air has low thermal conductivity (conducts heat poorly) meaning it {{is a poor}} coolant. Ambient air cooling is sometimes adequate for light cuts and low duty cycles typical of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) or hobbyist work. Production work requires <b>heavy</b> <b>cutting</b> over long time periods and typically produces more heat than air cooling can remove. Rather than pausing production while the tool cools, using liquid coolant removes significantly more heat more rapidly, and can also speed cutting and reduce {{friction and}} tool wear.|$|E
2500|$|A remake was {{initially}} attempted {{in the early}} 2000s, when the company announced a remake for PlayStation 2 alongside Final Fantasy VIII and IX, but nothing further was heard of these projects. The main reason attempts had failed was because remaking VII on current hardware would be a [...] "massive" [...] undertaking, and if kept within a single installment would require <b>heavy</b> <b>cutting</b> of content. Another reason cited was that the staff were preoccupied with developing Final Fantasy XIII and its sequels, and Remake {{would have been an}} equally large or larger project hard to undertake at the same time. Once the XIII series ended, the team were free to pursue other projects. The Remake project finally began when Final Fantasy producer Shinji Hashimoto broached the subject to Kitase, Nojima and Nomura. All three were reaching a stage of life that they defined as [...] "that age": all felt that if they waited much longer, they might not be alive to or would be too old to develop a remake of VII, and passing the project on to a new generation did not feel right. Another reason for developing the title was that Square Enix was creating a growing library of PlayStation 4 titles, and the team hoped to increase the console's popularity. A notable absence from the original team was Nobuo Uematsu, who composed the original music for VII. By late 2015, the game had reached the stage where full development could begin.|$|E

50|$|A {{morse taper}} reamer is used {{manually}} to finish morse taper sleeves. These sleeves are a tool {{used to hold}} machine cutting tools or holders in the spindles of machines such as a drill or milling machine. The reamer shown is a finishing reamer.

50|$|The {{frequency}} and amplitude {{of the machine}} controls the finish of the parts. The frequencies can vary from 900 to 3600 cycles per minute (CPM) and the amplitude can vary from 0 to 3/16 in. High frequencies, 1800 CPM or greater, and small amplitudes are used for fine finishes or delicate parts, whereas large amplitudes are used for <b>heavier</b> <b>cutting.</b> High frequencies and amplitudes can roll burrs and peen edges. The circulation of parts is best at higher frequencies, therefore, heavy pieces are run at these high frequencies with moderate amplitudes of 3/32 to 1/8 in.|$|R

5000|$|The ship's axe rapidly {{developed}} {{into the modern}} fireaxe and some are indistinguishable from their true naval counterparts. Modern British fire axes, war-time trench axes and even some tool axes have characteristics similar to boarding axes. Many are passed off as [...] "boarding axes" [...] either spuriously or by accident. True boarding axes had <b>heavy</b> <b>cutting</b> blades that either broadly flared out at the edge or were single-flared. Some had langet straps to secure the blade, but others did not. Most importantly, true boarding axes had thick 3 or 4-sided wicked spikes that curved downward protruding from the non-bladed end.|$|E
50|$|The noun {{scissors}} {{is treated}} as a plural noun, and therefore takes a plural verb (e.g., these scissors are). Alternatively, it is {{also referred to as}} a pair of scissors. In American English, a pair is singular and therefore takes a singular verb (e.g., this pair (of scissors) is). In other forms of English, a pair does not take the singular (so simply these scissors are).The word shears is used to describe similar instruments that are larger in size and for <b>heavier</b> <b>cutting.</b> Opinions vary geographically as to the size at which scissors become shears, but this is often at between six and eight inches (about 15 to 20 cm) in length.|$|R
50|$|The East Lincolnshire Railway was {{proposed}} {{as one of}} a group of allied railway bills during 1845 and 1846 as part of plans by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) to gain a link between London and Leeds / York. The line was built in a perfectly straight line with no <b>heavy</b> <b>cuttings.</b> There were ten bridges, three over the line and seven under the line. The contractors were Messrs. Waring and Sons, of Louth. The architects of the station buildings were John Grey Weightman and Matthew Ellison Hadfield of Sheffield. Original Plans for the railway had proposed a terminus at Pasture Street in Grimsby but an agreement with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway had allowed the Great Northern Railway to use Grimsby Town instead.|$|R
5000|$|In kitchen usage, {{a utility}} knife is between a chef's knife and paring knife in size, about 10 cm and 18 cm (4 and 7 inches) in length. The utility knife has {{declined}} in popularity, {{and is at}} times derided as filler for knife sets[...] This decline is attributed to the knife being : compared to a chef's knife, it is too short for many food items, has insufficient clearance when used at a cutting board, and is too fragile for <b>heavier</b> <b>cutting</b> tasks, while compared to a paring knife, which is used when cutting between one's hands, (e.g., carving a radish), the added length offers no benefit and indeed makes control harder in these fine tasks. [...] Some designs have a serrated blade.|$|R
50|$|Between 1890 and 1920, loggers cleared {{most of the}} Allegheny Plateau. Save for a few {{pockets of}} old growth forest, the current forests, which contain most of the presettlement species in {{different}} relative abundances and distribution, originated at that time. The <b>heavy</b> <b>cutting</b> favored hardwoods and created massive amounts of coniferous slash, providing ideal conditions for widespread and intense fires. The fires were {{a major factor in}} the virtual elimination of white pine and hemlock in the Allegheny forests. Repeated fires also tended to reduce the proportion of sugar maple, beech, and other typical hardwoods and increase such species as aspen, pin cherry, sedges, grasses, and honeysuckles.|$|E
5000|$|The Ontario cutlery company {{continues}} to produce traditional sticking knives in their [...] "old hickory" [...] knife line. Some people may still want a sticking knife for chores other than slaughtering livestock. Although double edged blades are usually considered {{by law enforcement}} as weapons, in situations where they are acceptable they have a few advantages. Having twice the edge length of a single edge knife {{they can be used}} longer between sharpenings. This advantage may be offset however because the thumb of the cutting hand can't press against the spine of the blade. With a single edged blade thumb pressure is often exerted for <b>heavy</b> <b>cutting</b> chores.|$|E
50|$|The scutum {{is light}} enough {{to be held in}} one hand and its large height and width covered the entire wielder, making him very {{unlikely}} to get hit by missile fire and in hand-to-hand combat. The metal boss, or umbo, in the centre of the scutum also made it an auxiliary punching weapon as well. Its composite construction meant that early versions of the scutum could fail from a <b>heavy</b> <b>cutting</b> or piercing blow which was experienced in the Roman Campaigns against Carthage and Dacia where the Falx and Falcata could easily penetrate and rip through the scutum. The effects of these weapons prompted design changes that made the scutum more resilient such as thicker planks and metal edges.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ti 6 Al 4 V is {{one kind}} of difficult-to-machine {{aeronautical}} materials, which is generally machined by coated cemented carbide tools. A three-dimensional face milling model is developed in this paper with finite element analysis software AdvantEdge to analyze influences of tool materials on tool temperatures, cutting forces and tool stresses. The simulation results have shown that PCBN tools are the most appropriate for machining titanium alloy when it is machined with <b>heavier</b> <b>cutting</b> parameters. Cemented carbide-K tools and PCD tools are suitable for finish machining titanium alloy. The PCD tools are superior to cemented carbides-K under the same machining conditions. Nature diamond cutting tools are incompatibility to machine titanium alloy due to their higher costs and carbonization at high temperature. In the view of cutting forces and distributions of tool stresses, nature diamond tools are optimal and the cemented carbides-K are the poorest in machinability rate at the same cutting conditions, while super-hard tools gets longer tool life...|$|R
5000|$|This new line, {{like the}} half {{mile or so}} of railway between {{the south end of}} the bridge and Dalmeny, is the {{property}} not of the North British but of the Forth Bridge Railway Company. The two form what are called the approaches to the bridge. The north approach, two miles in length, was commenced ... in September 1887. Owing to the extremely irregular and rocky nature of the ground, the work, considering the shortness of the route, has been excessive. There are two tunnels, one under Inverkeithing 400 yards long, and the other, which is shorter, close to the end of the great bridge. Besides these, there is a very <b>heavy</b> <b>cutting,</b> and two very large embankments... The total amount of excavation and embankments is about 300,000 cubic yards. The cost, including land, which is here very cheap, will be about £90,000.|$|E

60|$|I {{made three}} short {{excursions}} in Grand Canary to Telde, to the Caldera, and to Doramas, which {{showed me the}} formation of the island. My notes taken at the time must now be quoted. En route for the former, we drove past the large city-hospital: here in old times was another strong wall, defending the southern part, and corresponding with the northern or Barranco line. The road running to the south-south-west was peculiarly good; the tunnel through the hill-spur suggested classical and romantic Posilippo. It was well parapeted near the sea, and it had <b>heavy</b> <b>cuttings</b> in the white tosca, a rock somewhat resembling the calcaire grossier of the Paris basin. This light pumice-like stone, occasionally forming a conglomerate or pudding, and slightly effervescing with acids, is fertile where soft, and where hard quite sterile.

We then bent inland, or westward, crossed barren stony ground, red and black, and entered the pretty and fertile valley with its scatter of houses known as La Vega de Ginamar.|$|R
