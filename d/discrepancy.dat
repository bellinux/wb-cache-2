40|$|AbstractNursing home {{residents}} {{are at risk}} for medication errors when being transferred between wards. Medication reconciliation is a process used to verify medication use, identify variations and rectify medication errors during transitions. This pilot study was performed to evaluate a pharmacist-directed medication-reconciliation program in a nursing home setting. The number and types of <b>discrepancies</b> 3 months before (the control period) and after (the study period) implementation of a medication-reconciliation program were compared. A pharmacist performed medication reconciliation and discussed <b>discrepancies</b> with care providers in the study period. There were 190 / 209 (90. 9 %) and 220 / 266 (82. 7 %) documented <b>discrepancies</b> during the control and study periods, respectively. The major <b>discrepancies</b> found in both periods were the addition or omission of drugs. Of the 46 undocumented <b>discrepancies</b> in the study period, 13 (28. 3 %) were confirmed to be intentional changes. The suggestions made by the pharmacist were accepted in 19 of the remaining 33 undocumented (and unintentional) <b>discrepancies.</b> Eleven of 12 harmful <b>discrepancies</b> in the study period were corrected in a timely manner {{as a result of the}} medication-reconciliation program, that is, 91. 7 % of the harmful <b>discrepancies</b> were successfully prevented. But five (26. 3 %) harmful unintentional <b>discrepancies</b> of the 19 undocumented <b>discrepancies</b> in the control period could not be prevented from affecting patients.

40|$|<b>Discrepancies</b> between people’s ought selves {{and their}} actual selves and their ideal selves and actual selves predict the emo-tions that {{individuals}} experience. The authors predicted that internal versus external causal attributions for self-discrepancies should moderate {{the relationship between}} self-discrepancies and emotions, resulting in more refined predictions for both agitation-and dejection-related emotions and for two additional types of emotion, namely, anger-related and discontent-related emo-tions. Results of two studies generally supported the predictions that agitation-related emotions and dejection-related emotions were positively associated with actual-ought <b>discrepancies</b> and actual-ideal <b>discrepancies,</b> respectively, only when causal attri-butions for the <b>discrepancies</b> were internally based. Anger-related emotions and emotions of discontent were positively asso-ciated with actual-ought and actual-ideal <b>discrepancies,</b> respec-tively, primarily when causal attributions were externally based. Study 2, which addressed group <b>discrepancies</b> and group-based emotions, generally replicated the findings when group identifi-cation was high, yielding a more complex model {{of the link between}} <b>discrepancies</b> and emotions...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: When {{patients}} are admitted to, and discharged from hospital {{there is a}} high chance of <b>discrepancies</b> and errors occurring during the transfer of patients' medication information. This often causes drug related problems. Correct and fast communication of patients' medication information between community pharmacy and hospital is necessary. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the number, type, and origin of <b>discrepancies</b> within discharge documents and between discharge documents and information in the pharmacy computer system, concerning the medication of patients living independently when they are discharged from hospital. Second, to test which variables {{have an impact on the}} number of <b>discrepancies</b> found and to study the time spent on the medication reconciliation process. SETTING: One quality-certified community pharmacy in the Netherlands. METHODS: Pharmacists reviewed discharge documents of patients discharged over one year. This information was compared to information available in the pharmacy computer system. <b>Discrepancies</b> were discussed with medical specialists and/or general practitioners. Type and origin of <b>discrepancies</b> were classified. Differences in variables between hospitals were tested using Independent-Samples Mann-Whitney U Test and Pearson Chi Square test. Poisson regression analysis was performed to test the impact of variables on the number of <b>discrepancies</b> found. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Number, type and origin of <b>discrepancies</b> for all independently living patients discharged from the hospital. RESULTS: During the study period, 100 discharges took place and were analyzed. No differences were found between the two main hospitals, a university hospital and a teaching hospital. In total, 223 <b>discrepancies</b> were documented. Sixty-nine discharges (69. 0 %) required consultation with a patients' medical specialist. A majority of the <b>discrepancies</b> (73. 1 %) have their origin in hospital information. The number of <b>discrepancies</b> found increased with the number of medicines prescribed at discharge. The community pharmacist spent, on average, 45 min on the medication review after discharge. This included 11 min for counseling the patient. CONCLUSION: Many <b>discrepancies</b> were found between different information sources at patient discharge from hospital. A majority of the <b>discrepancies</b> had their origin in hospital information. The number of medicines after discharge was related to the number of <b>discrepancies</b> found. The medication reconciliation process took an average of 45 minutes per patient...|$|R
5|$|On June 7, 2010, {{long after}} the microlensing event had subsided, the science teams {{studying}} the star used the NACO adaptive optics facility at the Very Large Telescope in Chile to determine the actual apparent magnitude of the star that microlensed its background star, hoping {{to compare it to}} the magnitude of the star measured during the microlensing event. A <b>discrepancy</b> was found, a <b>discrepancy</b> that may have been a result of either error or of a planetary body. Interpretation of follow-up observations led to the planet's confirmation. The ratio between the planet's mass and its host star's mass is well-constrained, but a large interval of uncertainty exists because the host star's mass is known within a large confidence interval that spans the mass of all red dwarf stars.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} radiology residents {{in the interpretation of}} on-call, emergency "triple-rule-out" (TRO) computed tomographic (CT) studies in patients with acute chest pain. The study was institutional review board-approved and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant. Data from 617 on-call TRO studies were analyzed. Dedicated software enables subspecialty attendings to grade <b>discrepancies</b> in interpretation between preliminary trainee reports and their final interpretation as "unlikely to be significant" (minor <b>discrepancies)</b> or "likely to be significant" for patient management (major <b>discrepancies).</b> The frequency of minor, major and all <b>discrepancies</b> in resident's TRO interpretations was compared to 609 emergent non-electrocardiography (ECG) -synchronized chest CT studies using Pearson χ(2) test. Minor <b>discrepancies</b> occurred more often in the TRO group (9. 1 % vs. 3. 9 %, P <. 001), but {{there was no difference in}} the frequency of major <b>discrepancies</b> (2. 1 % vs. 2. 8 %, P =. 55). Minor <b>discrepancies</b> in the TRO group most commonly resulted from missed extrathoracic findings with missed liver lesions being the most frequent. Major <b>discrepancies</b> mostly encompassed cardiac and extracardiac vascular findings but did not result in unnecessary interventions, significant immediate changes in management, or adverse patient outcomes. On-call resident interpretation of TRO CT studies in patients with acute chest pain is congruent with final subspecialty attending interpretation in the overwhelming majority of cases. The rate of <b>discrepancies</b> likely to affect patient management in this domain is not different from emergent non-ECG-synchronized chest CT...|$|R

40|$|To compare drugs {{prescribed}} on hospital admission {{with the}} list of drugs taken prior to admission for adult patients admitted to a cardiology unit and to identify {{the role of a}} pharmacist in identifying and resolving medication <b>discrepancies.</b> This study was conducted in a 300 bed university hospital in Brazil. Clinical pharmacists taking medication histories and reconciling medications prescribed on admission with a list of drugs used prior to admission. <b>Discrepancies</b> were classified as justified (e. g., based on the pharmacotherapeutic guidelines of the hospital studied) or unintentional. Treatments were reviewed within 48 hours following hospitalization. Unintentional <b>discrepancies</b> were further classified according to the categorization of medication error severity. Pharmacists verbally contacted the prescriber to recommend actions to resolve the <b>discrepancies.</b> A total of 181 <b>discrepancies</b> were found in 50 patients (86 %). Of these <b>discrepancies,</b> 149 (82. 3 %) were justified changes to the patient's home medication regimen; however, 32 (17. 7 %) <b>discrepancies</b> found in 24 patients were unintentional. Pharmacists made 31 interventions and 23 (74. 2 %) were accepted. Among unintentional <b>discrepancies,</b> the most common was a different medication dose on admission (42 %). Of the unintentional <b>discrepancies</b> 13 (40. 6 %) were classified as error without harm, 11 (34. 4 %) were classified as error without harm but which could affect the patient and require monitoring, 3 (9. 4 %) as errors could have resulted in harm and 5 (15. 6 %) were classified as circumstances or events that have the capacity to cause harm.
