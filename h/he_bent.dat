5|$|One of {{the best}} known of these tells of a {{stranger}} who arrived at the club on a stormy night. Invited in, he joined the members in a card game. One player dropped his card on the floor and when <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> under the table to retrieve it noticed that the stranger had a cloven hoof. At this point the visitor disappeared in a ball of flame. This story, which is found in texts from at least the 1930s, is very similar to one associated with Loftus Hall, County Wexford. The Loftus family owned a hunting lodge – known as Dolly Mount – which was also to be found on Mount Pelier Hill.|$|E
25|$|On June 22, 2007, Zimmerman fielded {{a routine}} ground ball {{that ended up}} in his jersey. As <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> over to underhand the ball at his stomach level, his jersey top opened and hung {{down in front of}} his glove, causing the ball to go into his jersey instead of his {{positioned}} glove.|$|E
25|$|Ronnie Marcus, an Israeli psychic and {{claimant}} of psychokinetic metal bending, was tested in 1994 in scientifically controlled conditions {{and failed to}} produce any paranormal phenomena. According to magicians, his alleged psychokinetic feats were sleight of hand tricks. Marcus bent a letter opener by the concealed application of force and a frame-by-frame analysis of video showed that <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> a spoon from pressure from his thumb by ordinary, physical means.|$|E

25|$|Later that month, on January 20, in Horn Hill, Limestone County, Texas, Hardin {{claimed he}} {{killed a man}} in a gunfight after an {{argument}} at the circus. Less than a week after this incident, in nearby Kosse, Texas, Hardin was accompanying a saloon girl home when they were accosted by her pimp, who demanded money. Hardin threw money on the ground and shot the would-be thief when <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> over to pick it up.|$|E
25|$|One night, Pu Tong Seal {{was very}} tired from his all-day journey on foot, {{and began to}} fall asleep in the jungle. The moment he dozed off, a tiger {{attacked}} him. He {{seemed to have a}} sixth sense, even when resting. The warlord never took chances, day or night, but was always alert for the unexpected ambush whether by human or animal. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> the tiger's body so hard that the spinal cord broke, and the tiger died on the spot.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle of Stalingrad, some units {{within the}} {{division}} were seen to construct caves which {{would later be}} transformed into a field hospital and an equipment storage room. The division fought in the ruined city until Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus' surrender in January 1943, with the 297th division's and IV Army Corps mutual commander, General Pfeffer, following suit into Soviet captivity on the 16th. With the airfield lost to the Red Army, the division was so badly-beaten it could hardly be considered a proper fighting force. Pfeffer's successor as division commander, Major General Moritz von Drebber, finally surrendered to the Red Army a mere nine days later. A photograph of Drebber and several other Axis commanders was taken; one of the men photographed was Dr. Otto Renoldi, the chief surgeon for the 6th Army. A chaplain for the division was executed by a Soviet officer when <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> over to treat a wounded man.|$|E

500|$|The name {{tantalum}} {{was derived}} from the name of the mythological Tantalus, the father of Niobe in Greek mythology. In the story, he had been punished after death by being condemned to stand knee-deep in water with perfect fruit growing above his head, both of which eternally tantalized him. (If <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> to drink the water, it drained below the level he could reach, and if he reached for the fruit, the branches moved out of his grasp.) Ekeberg wrote [...] "This metal I call tantalum ... partly in allusion to its incapacity, when immersed in acid, to absorb any and be saturated." ...|$|E
500|$|At around 16:15, Linge ordered SS-Untersturmführer Heinz Krüger and SS-Oberscharführer Werner Schwiedel {{to roll up}} the rug in Hitler's {{study to}} burn it. Schwiedel later stated that upon {{entering}} the study, he saw {{a pool of blood}} the size of a [...] "large dinner plate" [...] by the arm-rest of the sofa. Noticing a spent cartridge case, <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> down and picked it up from where it lay on the rug about 1mm from a 7.65 pistol. The two men removed the blood-stained rug, carried it up the stairs and outside to the Chancellery garden. There the rug was placed on the ground and burned.|$|E

500|$|After lunch, Harvey {{accelerated}} {{after the}} second new ball was taken, and 80 minutes into the middle session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. Harvey's knock had taken 177 minutes and included 14 fours. The partnership yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was eventually out for 112 from 183 balls, bowled by Laker while playing a cross-batted sweep. His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw his head back in disappointment. Harvey ended as the first Australian left-hander to score a century on his Ashes debut, in an innings noted for powerful driving {{on both sides of}} the wicket. The innings and the high rate of scoring helped to swing the match into a balanced position when Australia were finally dismissed for 458. In the second innings, Harvey took two noted catches, including one where <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> over to catch the ball at ankle height while running. Fingleton said that it [...] "was the catch of the season—or, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|When {{the banquet}} had lasted for three days, Urse and Roluo escaped from Uppsala, {{early in the}} morning in {{carriages}} where they had put all the Swedish king's treasure. In order to lessen their burden, and to occupy any pursuing warriors they spread gold in their path (later in the work, this is referred to as [...] "sowing the Fyrisvellir"), although there was a rumour that she only spread gilded copper. When Athislus, who was pursuing the escapers saw that a precious ring was lying on the ground, <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> down to pick it up. Roluo was pleased to see the king of Sweden bent down, and escaped in the ships with his mother.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 August, Marwan {{signed into}} the Panther Motel in Deerfield Beach, Florida, paying US$500, saying {{he wanted to}} stay until 2 September, and listing a Mailboxes Etc. as his {{permanent}} address. His register entry indicated that he was driving a blue Chevrolet Malibu, assumed to be the one rented by Atta two weeks prior, and manager Richard Surma said that <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> rules to allow Marwan to have another man as an overnight guest. On 28 August, Marwan went to the Miami International Airport, accompanied by an unknown man, where he purchased his ticket for Flight 175. On 9 September, the motel manager, cleaning the room that al-Shehhi had vacated, found a bag containing a German/English dictionary, a protractor, flight manuals and local airport listings. Another employee later reported finding [...] a box cutter.|$|E

2500|$|Abdul-Jabbar {{was well}} known for his {{trademark}} [...] "skyhook", a hook shot in which <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> his entire body (rather than just the arm) like a straw in one fluid motion to raise the ball and then release it at the highest point of his arm's arching motion. Combined with his long arms and great height——the skyhook was difficult for a defender to block without goaltending. It was a reliable and feared offensive weapon and contributed to his high lifetime field goal percentage of 0.559. He was adept at shooting the skyhook with either hand, which made him {{even more difficult to}} defend against, though as a right-handed player, he was stronger shooting the skyhook with his right hand than he was with his left. According to Abdul-Jabbar, he learned the move in fifth grade after practicing with the Mikan Drill and soon learned to value it, as it was [...] "the only shot I could use that didn't get smashed back in my face".|$|E
2500|$|The blurb on {{the inside}} flap of the dustjacket of the first UK edition (which is also {{repeated}} opposite the title page) reads:"Believe it or not, Bobby Jones had topped his drive! He was badly bunkered. There were no eager crowds to groan with dismay. That is easily explained – for Bobby was merely the fourth son of the Vicar of Marchbolt, a small golfing resort on the Welsh coast. And Bobby, {{in spite of his}} name, was not much of a golfer. Still, that game was destined to be a memorable one. On going to play his ball, Bobby suddenly came upon the body of a man. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> over him. The man was not yet dead. [...] "Why didn't they ask Evans?" [...] he said, and then the eyelids dropped, the jaw fell... It {{was the beginning of a}} most baffling mystery. That strange question of the dying man is the recurring theme of Agatha Christie's magnificent story. Read it and enjoy it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{approached}} another {{table where}} two girls were hiding. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> down {{to look at}} them and dismissed them as [...] "pathetic". Harris then moved to another table where he fired twice, injuring 16-year-olds Nicole Nowlen and John Tomlin. When Tomlin attempted {{to move away from the}} table, Klebold kicked him. Harris then taunted Tomlin's attempt at escape before Klebold shot the youth repeatedly, killing him. Harris then walked back over to the other side of the table where Lauren Townsend lay dead. Behind the table, a 16-year-old girl named Kelly Fleming had, like Bree Pasquale, sat next to the table rather than beneath it due to a lack of space. Harris shot Fleming with his shotgun, hitting her in the back and killing her instantly. He shot at the table behind Fleming, hitting Townsend and Kreutz again, and wounding 18-year-old Jeanna Park. An autopsy later revealed that Townsend died from the earlier gunshots inflicted by Klebold.|$|E

All the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them. 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them, 4 they said to him, ‘Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of {{committing}} adultery. 5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?’ 6 They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, ‘Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.’ 8 And once again <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> down and wrote on the ground. 9 When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus straightened up and said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?’ 11 She said, ‘No one, sir.’ And Jesus said, ‘Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.’ ...|$|E
