Passing the tide-rip Charybdis, a meeting of currents, which called only for another hand at the wheel; and the castled crag of naughty Scylla, whose town has grown prodigiously, we bade adieu to the 'tower of Pelorus.' Then we shaped our course for the Islands of Ã†olus, or the Winds, and the Lipari archipelago, all volcanic cones whose outlines were misty as Ossian's spectres.

Ammianus Marcellinus, Julian's chief biographer and highly valued and praised historian of 354-378, also sheds doubt that a Christian was the guilty party and echoes Libanius' later thoughts that an unknown Persian committed the <b>deed</b> that <b>cost</b> Rome dearly. As a result, the truth of who killed Julian may never be known with certainty.|$|R

50|$|His {{citation}} reads:On March 30, 1974, when a fuel tanker and {{freight truck}} collided {{and burst into}} flames at Vegreville, Alberta, Kenneth Bishop withstood severe burns to his body {{to save the life}} of a man who lay helpless in the midst of flames and explosions. On impact, the man was flung from his truck and suffered a serious injury. Some 7,000 gallons of gasoline from his ruptured tanker ignited and surrounded the driver within walls of fire. No one but Kenneth Bishop dared attempt to save the victim and as he approached the inferno, the rescuer was thrown several feet by an explosion. His clothes caught fire but he refused to turn away. Already severely burnt, Mr. Bishop protected his face from the blistering heat and snaked his way to the victim. Taking a firm grip of the man, under the arms, he dragged him safely away from the conflagration. Although aware that his <b>deed</b> might <b>cost</b> him his own life, Kenneth Bishop exhibited the finest example of selfless courage and humanitarian concern to save a complete stranger.|$|R
30|$|One {{of the key}} {{operational}} activities in the power system is to schedule power production according to the predicted load demands. Dynamic economic and environmental dispatches (DEED) are both crucial objectives in this scheduling task because a small percentage improvement may potentially bring significant cost savings and operational improvements [1, 2]. The goal of economic dispatch is to minimize the cost by determining the power production of thermal power plant units, while managing system constraints, balancing power production and load demand, and meeting plant operational requirements, e.g. ramp rates. Similarly, the objective of environmental dispatch is to minimize emissions under the same system constraints. Both dispatch problems are difficult to solve due to the non-smooth non-convex <b>DEED</b> formulations in <b>cost</b> functions and constraints, especially for large power systems [3].|$|R

I have made amends for that evil <b>deed.</b> It has <b>cost</b> me a long and hard struggle to realise the thousands of pounds that were requisite; {{for some of the}} goods had got damaged by damp in the cavern of the Isle of Palms, but the profits of my engineering and shipwright business have increased of late, and I have managed to square it all off with interest. And now, Mary, I can do no more. If I knew of any others who have suffered at my hands I would restore what I took tenfold--but I know of none. It therefore remains that I should work this business for the good of mankind. Of all the thousands that have passed through my hands I have not used one penny. You know that I have always kept the business that has grown out of the labour of my own hands distinct from that which has been reared on the stolen goods. I have lived and supported you by it, and now, through God's blessing, it has increased {{to such an extent that}} I think we may afford to build a somewhat more commodious house and furnish it a little better." ...|$|R

At the time of the society's offer, the institute's grounds consisted of 15 acres. Offers for campus locations were also made by citizens of Clarksburg and Parkersburg. The society's offer was the only one to include an existing building on its grounds. The Board of Regents accepted the society's offer, and a formal transfer of the Romney Classical Institute's former campus was made. The society discovered that, in order to make good on its promise, it had to raise more than $1,000, a close to impossible task during the Reconstruction Era in Romney. Following a resolution on July 11, 1870, to raise between $1,200 and $1,300, a subscription of $1,383.60 was raised after 118 individuals and firms donated the needed funds, and shortly thereafter the formal transfer of the property was completed. At that time, the institute's property was valued at about $20,000.|$|R
