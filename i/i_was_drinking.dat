500|$|In a 2003 interview, Jordison {{explained}} {{that despite the}} initial problems more than enough material was written for the album and added that [...] "it's better to have stuff to pick from than to settle for shit", in contrast to how Slipknot settled too soon with fewer songs on previous albums. Band members were divided over their experience of working with producer Rubin; some doubted his commitment to Slipknot as he split his time between many artists at once. Lead vocalist Corey Taylor admitted {{in an interview that}} he drank heavily throughout their time in the mansion, saying [...] "I would drink from the moment I got up until the moment I passed out." [...] He {{explained that}}; [...] "everything I did while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> sounded like shit", while expressing how unhappy he was with the choice of vocal takes which ended up on the album. During this time, percussionist Crahan worked on , a video documenting the creation process of the album and the touring which would follow.|$|E

He stated during his You Can't Fix Stupid show, [...] "Somebody asked what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking.</b> If the company that made the stuff <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> was paying me, I'd have it in their bottle and not mine. But it's the kind of scotch that people drink that are going to die penniless. It's good though!" [...] In 2009 Comedy Central released Ron's stand up DVD Behavioral Problems.|$|E
2500|$|Snow Patrol's frontman, Gary Lightbody, {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} writing [...] "Run" [...] in 2000. In an interview with Michael Odell, from Q magazine, Lightbody explained the song was not written about [...] "being a child", as he tended to say. He described: [...] "I was on a massive bender and one night <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> in the bar of the Glasgow School of Art. I fell down a full flight of stairs. Jonny Quinn found me in the stairwell with blood {{coming out of my}} head ... I split my head open and my eye was closed and I lost a few teeth ... I wrote Run soon after on this little guitar I'd tried to smash up in my shitty little room near Hillhead. The words 'Light up, light up' gave me this sense of a beacon." [...] In an interview with Daily Mail in 2009, Lightbody added: [...] "We had nothing. I was in a flat in Glasgow. No doubt it was raining. The song was me writing about an imagined world, projecting myself into better times." [...] Beside Lightbody, it was written by Quinn, Nathan Connolly, Mark McClelland and Iain Archer.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the loss}} of his IBO belt, Booth spent almost two years away from the ring as he {{struggled}} with an alcohol addiction. Speaking about the matter in 2010 Booth said [...] "I took time off boxing because I was too drunk...No manager would look at me and all the doors were shut. I'd go on these mad binges and spend loads of money." [...] After earning £10,000 in his fight with Damaen Kelly, Booth had spent the money on a combination of drink and drugs with the money disappearing within six weeks. Speaking about his addiction, Booth said that drink had always been a part of family life but the suicide of his sister Deana had hit him particularly hard. Booth said, [...] "It was too young to die. She was a funloving girl. I don’t know why she did it. She got run over when she was young. She’d had a tragic time. It mentally disturbed me." [...] Two weeks later, following the tragedy, Booth fought and beat the Bulgarian boxer Dimitar Alipiev whilst drunk, saying, [...] "I wanted to fight because I didn’t {{know what to do with}} myself after Deana died. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> on the day of the fight. I was numb. I was in no pain. I just didn’t care. It was the only time in my life I didn’t care." [...] It was Booth's 12th professional contest. Booth said that he also fell into bad company: [...] "I was in parks and dosshouses. I was British champion but walking around with drunks and thinking they were mates. I’d get up, drink cider and top up during the day. Sometimes, I’d get a bottle of cheap vodka and walk around with it in my pocket." [...] Eventually Booth checked into an alcohol clinic and begun the process of getting clean: [...] "It frightened me and I wanted to stop, but it was only when my body rejected the drink that I found the courage. My stomach packed in. I was sicking blood every morning." [...] He began training once more with trainer Tony Harris and began to rebuild his boxing career despite occasionally relapsing into drink. Eventually he gave up drinking altogether, saying, [...] "I’m one of those who has to be abstinent, because one drink isn’t going to do anything for me except start it all again." ...|$|E

60|$|Never {{before had}} I been out after nightfall. I gazed enthralled at the splendours {{of fruit and}} cakes, silks and sweetmeats packed high behind the glass fronts.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drinking</b> in {{his words}} and smiling away, as {{conceited}} as a cock upon a wall, when, all in a breath, back went his right hand over his shoulder. Something sang like an arrow through the air: I felt a blow and then a sharp pang, and there I was pinned by the shoulder to the mast. In the horrid pain and surprise of the moment--I scarce can say it was by my own volition, and I am sure it was without a conscious aim--both my pistols went off, and both escaped out of my hands. They did not fall alone; with a choked cry, the coxswain loosed his grasp upon the shrouds, and plunged head first into the water.|$|E

I was ready too, and wounded two of them as I fought my way to the door. As I opened it one of them stabbed me in the shoulder, but it was a slanting blow. Once out they all attacked me at once, and in another minute you would have had to look for another muleteer. 'Tis strange, señors, that you should have saved my life as Mr. Barnett did.

I put out into the yard, and touched him on the shoulder. Zounds, lad! you should have seen him spring back and spit at me like a wildcat with every hair of his head in a bristle. He whipped a knife from under his smock, for he thought, doubtless, that I was about to earn the reward by handing him over to the red-coats. I told him that his secret was safe with me, and I asked him if he had heard that you were laid by the heels. He answered that he knew it, and that he would be answerable that no harm befell you, though in truth it seemed to me that he had his hands full in trimming his own sails, without acting as pilot to another. However, there I left him, and there I shall find him again if so be as he has done you an injury.' ...|$|E
