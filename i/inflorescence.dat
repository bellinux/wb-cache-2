5|$|Six {{species of}} honeyeater have been {{observed}} feeding at its flowers, as have insects including honeybees, ants, butterflies, beetles and native bees.

5|$|The cabbage tree's year {{begins in}} autumn among the tight spike of unopened leaves {{projecting}} from {{the centre of}} each tuft of leaves. Some of the growing tips have changed from making leaves to producing inflorescences for the coming spring, and around these, two or three buds begin to produce leaves. The <b>inflorescence</b> and the leaf buds pass the winter protected by the enveloping spike of unopened leaves. Months later in spring or early summer, it bears its flowers {{on the outside of}} the tree, exposed to insects and birds. Flowering takes place over a period of four to six weeks, giving maximum exposure to pollinating insects. The flowers produce a sweet perfume which attracts large numbers of insects. The nectar produced by the flowers contains aromatic compounds, mainly esters and terpenes, which are particularly attractive to moths. Bees use the nectar to produce a light honey to feed their young and increase the size of the hive in the early summer. It takes about two months for the fruit to ripen, and by the end of summer a cabbage tree can have thousands of small fruits available for birds to eat and disperse. The strong framework of the <b>inflorescence</b> can easily bear the weight of heavy birds like the New Zealand pigeon, which was formerly the major disperser of the seeds. Each fruit contains three to six shiny, black seeds which are coated in a charcoal-like substance called phytomelan. The latter may serve to protect the seeds from the digestive process in the gut of a bird. The seeds are also rich in linoleic acid as a food source for the developing embryo plant, a compound which is also important in the egg-laying cycle of birds. Because it takes about two years for a particular stem to produce an <b>inflorescence,</b> cabbage trees tend to flower heavily in alternative years, with a bumper flowering every three to five years. Each <b>inflorescence</b> bears 5,000 to 10,000 flowers, so a large <b>inflorescence</b> may carry about 40,000 seeds, or one million seeds for the whole tree in a good flowering year—hundreds of millions for a healthy grove of trees.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} ants on the insect {{community}} on <b>inflorescences</b> of Byrsonima crassifolia (Malpighiaceae) {{were tested in}} an ant exclusion experiment in a cerrado vegetation in southeastern Brazil. Forty-four species of insects (23 families) and nine species of ants (6 genera and 3 subfamilies) {{were found on the}} <b>inflorescences</b> of B. crassifolia. The exclusion of ants, primarily Camponotus sericeiventris and Camponotus spp., reduced the treehopper population to 20 % of the original abundance. Ant exclusion and time influenced the abundance of chewing (Exclusion, P< 0. 001; Time, P< 0. 002), and sucking insects (Exclusion, P< 0. 02; Time, P< 0. 01). Twice as many chewing and sucking insects were found on ant-excluded <b>inflorescences</b> as compared to control <b>inflorescences</b> (P< 0. 001). One and half more sucking insects were found on ant-excluded than on control <b>inflorescences.</b> Only time significantly influenced the richness of chewing and sucking insects associated with B. crassifolia <b>inflorescences.</b> <b>Inflorescences</b> on control branches were significantly less attacked by herbivores than <b>inflorescences</b> on ant-excluded branches (P< 0. 001). Therefore, these results suggest that the presence of ants alters the structure of insect herbivore community associated with B. crassifolia...|$|R

40|$|Manual {{harvesting}} of marigold (Calendula officinalis L.) <b>inflorescences</b> {{results in}} superior quality, but requires enormous manpower. The {{objectives of the}} research were to examine the possibility of mechanized harvesting of marigold <b>inflorescences</b> by virtual rotating comb-type chamomile harvester, widely used in South Eastern Europe, and to develop the mechanical separator for the <b>inflorescences</b> from the harvested mass. The impact of coefficient R, ratio of the harvester’s penetration into the <b>inflorescences</b> horizon and the width of <b>inflorescences</b> band (i. e. the average value of the highest and lowest <b>inflorescences</b> span) on the harvest yield, was tested first. Separation was performed by a bespoke separator that uses five cascades of oscillating sieves made of longitudinally situated rods. Influence of oscillation frequencies and rod distances on separation efficiency was investigated. It was found that, for coefficient R value of 1. 3, an average of 97 % of the total <b>inflorescences</b> yield can be harvested. The proportion of <b>inflorescences</b> with stem length up to 2 cm was 65 % and 35 % for stems over 2 cm. The result of mechanized harvest was the reduction in both the number of succeeding harvests and the yield, due to bud damages and elimination. The highest separation efficiency was obtained by using 2. 7 Hz oscillation frequency and combination of 6 / 8 mm rods’ distances in sieves. After three passes of the harvested mass through the device, approximately 92 % of <b>inflorescences</b> were separated. Future investigations should be directed towards solving the issue of mechanical shortening of the <b>inflorescences</b> stems and evaluating the economic viability of mechanized harvesting within the proposed procedure...|$|R
5|$|The cotyledons of Banksia paludosa, B.marginata and B.integrifolia {{are very}} similar in appearance.

Elephant shrews seem to be acquiring pollen while foraging for insects in the <b>inflorescences.</b> Compared with the larger bird-pollinated <b>inflorescences</b> of P. repens (L.)

50|$|Larval {{development}} of the weevil Derelomus chamaeropsis occurs within rachises of <b>inflorescences</b> of male plants during autumn and winter. At {{the beginning of the}} next flowering period, adult weevils emerge from the dry and brittle stems of old <b>inflorescences</b> of the previous year of male plants only. Those that hatch in female plants die without concluding their development. This is because the palmettos are adapted to prevent the pollinating weevils from destroying the female <b>inflorescences</b> with their burden of seed. Weevils have been shown to lay eggs within female <b>inflorescences,</b> but as soon as seeds start to develop, eggs or larvae fail to continue their life cycle. On the other hand, male <b>inflorescences</b> have completed their function after pollination, so it is advantageous to the plant's reproduction for the weevils to complete their life cycles and shelter in the male <b>inflorescences,</b> thereby remaining available for pollination when they emerge in the following season.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSocial {{bees are}} known to avoid <b>inflorescences</b> marked with dead conspecifics or their smell. The {{avoidance}} response could be triggered by alarm signals actively given by attacked bees or by substances passively released through injuries as a by-product of the attack. To discriminate between these two options we note that both social and solitary bees are expected to react to nonsignalling cues associated with predation risk, while only social bees are expected to give alarm signals. We simulated risky <b>inflorescences</b> by pinching a landing bee with forceps, and compared {{the rate at which}} bees visited these experimental <b>inflorescences</b> and unmanipulated control <b>inflorescences.</b> We conducted the experiment with four species of social bees, Apis mellifera, Apis dorsata, Apis florea and Bombus terrestris and with three species of solitary bees, Eucera sp., Panurgus sp. and Nomia strigata. We found that while the three species of solitary bees responded similarly to control and experimental <b>inflorescences,</b> all four species of social bees strongly rejected <b>inflorescences</b> where we simulated a predation attempt. The finding that only social species avoided landing on dangerous <b>inflorescences</b> strongly suggests that the release of the alarm cue has been selected for its signalling value in social bees...|$|R

The bright yellow inflorescences occur in groups of 40 to 80 on -long racemes that arise from axillary buds. Each <b>inflorescence</b> is a ball-like structure that is covered by 40 to 100 small flowers that have five tiny petals (pentamerous) and long erect stamens, which give the flower head a fluffy appearance.|$|E
40|$|Argentine ant (Linepithema humile (Mayr)) invasions {{are often}} {{associated}} with the displacement of ground-dwelling arthropods. Argentine ant invasions can also exert other effects on the community through interactions with plants and their associated arthropods. For example, carbohydrate resources (e. g. floral or extrafloral nectar) may influence foraging behaviour and interactions among ants and other arthropods. In South Africa's Cape Floristic Region, Argentine ants and some native ant species are attracted to the floral nectar of Leucospermum conocarpodendron Rourke (Proteaceae), a native tree that also has extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). Despite having relatively low abundance in pitfall traps, Argentine ants visited <b>inflorescences</b> more frequently and in higher abundance than the most frequently observed native ants, Camponotus spp., though neither native nor Argentine ant floral foraging {{was influenced by the}} EFNs. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed significant dissimilarity in arthropod communities on <b>inflorescences</b> with Argentine ants compared to <b>inflorescences</b> with native or no ants, with Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Arachnida, Orthoptera, and Blattaria all being underrepresented in <b>inflorescences</b> with Argentine ants compared to ant-excluded <b>inflorescences.</b> Native honeybees (Apis mellifera capensis Eschscholtz) spent 75 % less time foraging on <b>inflorescences</b> with Argentine ants than on <b>inflorescences</b> without ants. Neither Argentine ant nor native ant visits to <b>inflorescences</b> had a detectable effect on seed set of Le. conocarpodendron. However, a pollen supplementation experiment revealed that like many other proteas, Le. conocarpodendron is not pollen-limited. Flower predation was negatively associated with increased ant visit frequency to the <b>inflorescences,</b> but did not differ among <b>inflorescences</b> visited by native and Argentine ants. Displacement of arthropods appears to be a consistent consequence of Argentine ant invasions. The displacement of floral arthropods by Argentine ants may have far-reaching consequences for this biodiversity hotspot and other regions that are rich in insect-pollinated plants...|$|R

It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male flowers tend to fall into two groups—those with cream or yellow flowers and those with some amount of purple in the flowers. Female flowers are even less well known than male flowers.|$|E

Swiss botanist Carl Meissner published a more detailed arrangement in 1856, placing B.sphaerocarpa in section Eubanksia because its <b>inflorescence</b> is a spike rather than a domed head, and in series Abietinae, whose members have inrolled leaf margins with no, or only very fine, serrations.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the phenology of the weed Achillea millefolium over a growing season in the Snowy Mountains. Vegetative and reproductive characteristics of plants in 1 m 2 quadrats were compared among sites at four different altitudes (medium and high montane, low and high subalpine) and three types of infrastructure (primary road, secondary road and building, total 12 sites). Altitude, infrastructure and time of year did not affect percentage cover of vegetation. Flowering started earlier and lasted longer in the low montane sites compared to high subalpine sites. The type of infrastructure only affected the number of reproductive structures {{at the peak of}} flowering, with A. millefolium growing next to buildings having two to three times more <b>inflorescences</b> per m 2 than along primary and secondary road verges. At the peak for each reproductive stage, there was an average of 1. 47 developing <b>inflorescences,</b> 21 <b>inflorescences</b> in bud, 24 <b>inflorescences</b> in flower, 4 <b>inflorescences</b> setting seed, and 3 releasing seed.

5|$|Like {{many members}} of the family Proteaceae, Banksia menziesii is largely self-incompatible; that is, inflorescences require pollinators to be fertilised and produce seed.

The individual flowers are uniform, and it is unclear why so few go on to develop follicles.
