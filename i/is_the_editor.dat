5|$|The {{extremely}} nested pseudonymity of {{this work}} adds a problem of interpretation. A and B are {{the authors of the}} work, Eremita <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>editor.</b> Kierkegaard's role in all this appears to be that he deliberately sought to disconnect himself from the points of view expressed in his works, although the absurdity of his pseudonyms' bizarre Latin names proves that he did not hope to thoroughly conceal his identity from the reader. Kierkegaard's Papers first edition VIII(2), B 81 - 89 explain this method in writing. On interpretation there is also much to be found in The Point of View of My Work as an Author.|$|E
