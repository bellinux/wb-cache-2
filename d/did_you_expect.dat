2500|$|Newark {{burned in}} 1967, where {{six days of}} rioting left 26 dead, 1500 injured, and the inner city a burned out shell. In Detroit in 1967, Governor George Romney sent in 7400 {{national}} guard troops to quell fire bombings, looting, and attacks on businesses and on police. Johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns. Detroit continued to burn for three more days until finally 43 were dead, 2250 were injured, 4000 were arrested; property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions. The biggest wave of riots came in April 1968 in over a hundred cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King. Johnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing, but this fell on deaf ears. Johnson's popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape, reinforcing the sense Johnson had {{lost control of the}} streets of major cities as well as his party. Johnson created the Kerner Commission to study the problem of urban riots, headed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner. According to press secretary George Christian, Johnson was unsurprised by the riots, saying: [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect?</b> I don't know why we're so surprised. When you put your foot on a man's neck and hold him down for three hundred years, and then you let him up, what's he going to do? He's going to knock your block off." ...|$|E
2500|$|Radio City Music Hall {{selected}} {{the film to}} be its Easter attraction. The film was a US box-office failure and many reviews, particularly those for Ball, were particularly brutal; the movie has a 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Time Magazine said, [...] "The movie spans about 20 years, and seems that long in running time [...] [...] [...] Miss Ball has been molded over the years {{into some sort of}} national monument, and she performs like one too. Her grace, her timing, her vigor have all vanished." [...] Time Out London declared she [...] "simply hasn't the drive and steel of a Rosalind Russell, an Angela Lansbury or a Ginger Rogers, all of whom played the part before her," [...] and said of Saks, [...] "When he's not ogling his star in perpetual soft focus and a $300,000 fashion parade, [...] fails to get enough retakes, match his shots, or inject the essential vim." [...] Pauline Kael in The New Yorker wondered, [...] "After forty years in movies and TV, did she discover in herself an unfulfilled ambition to be a flaming drag queen?" [...] The New Republics Stanley Kauffman, though he pointed out that Ball would have made a perfect Mame had she played the role [...] "fifteen years earlier," [...] described her as [...] "too old, too stringy in the legs, too basso in the voice, and too creaky in the joints." [...] Virtually every critic took notice of the heavy-handedness in photographing Ball out of focus, Rex Reed {{going so far as to}} suggest, albeit jokingly, that chicken fat was put over the lens. Some regarded this as evidence that those executives responsible for signing Ball, and Ball herself, knew from the outset that she was too old for her role. In her defense in regards to her lack of singing ability, Ball told one interviewer [...] "Mame stayed up all night and drank champagne! What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> her to sound like? Julie Andrews?" ...|$|E
