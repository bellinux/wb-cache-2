Subconfluent and confluent cells were labelled with [3 H]fucose for 24 h and the cell-surface components were released by mild Pronase treatment. After extensive Pronase digestion, cell-surface and cell-residue <b>glycopeptides</b> were fractionated on Bio-Gel P- 6. The cell surface contained {{a higher proportion}} of lower-molecular-weight <b>glycopeptides</b> than the residue. No significant difference in elution pattern was found between total cell-surface <b>glycopeptides</b> of subconfluent and confluent cells. However, confluent cells contained almost twice as much [3 H]-fucose-labelled <b>glycopeptides</b> that were bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose and were subsequently eluted with 20 mM-methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside as subconfluent cells. When the bound <b>glycopeptides</b> were chromatographed on Bio-Gel P- 6, it was found that confluent cells contained a larger proportion of lower-molecular-weight <b>glycopeptides</b> than subconfluent cells. This difference in size was eliminated after treatment of <b>glycopeptides</b> with sialidase. When growth of subconfluent cells was inhibited with a non-toxic concentration of retinoic acid, no significant effect on the elution pattern of [3 H]fucose-labelled <b>glycopeptides</b> was observed on either Bio-Gel P- 6 or concanavalin A-Sepharose. No significant difference was found in the total [3 H]fucose-labelled glycoproteins from subconfluent and confluent cells by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. It is suggested that the differences in [3 H]fucose-labelled <b>glycopeptides</b> between subconfluent and confluent cells are cell-density-dependent rather than growth-dependent, and that these differences are likely to result from some changes in glycosylation mechanism(s).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{analysis}} of intact <b>glycopeptides</b> by mass spectrometry is challenging {{due to the}} numerous possibilities for isomerization, both within the attached glycan {{and the location of}} the modification on the peptide backbone. Here, we demonstrate that high field asymmetric wave ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS), also known as differential ion mobility, is able to separate isomeric O-linked <b>glycopeptides</b> that have identical sequences but differing sites of glycosylation. Two <b>glycopeptides</b> from the glycoprotein mucin 5 AC, GT(GalNAc) -TPSPVPTTSTTSAP and GTTPSPVPTTST(GalNAc) TSAP (where GalNAc is O-linked N-acetylgalactosamine), were shown to coelute following reversed-phase liquid chromatography. However, FAIMS {{analysis of}} the <b>glycopeptides</b> revealed that the compensation voltage ranges in which the peptides were transmitted differed. Thus, it is possible at certain compensation voltages to completely separate the <b>glycopeptides.</b> Separation of the <b>glycopeptides</b> was confirmed by unique reporter ions produced by supplemental activation electron transfer dissociation mass spectrometry.

40|$|<b>Glycopeptides</b> {{from the}} surface of clones of hamster embryo cells were {{examined}} at various intervals after infection with polyoma virus. Two types of transformed cells were examined: (i) clones that showed delayed transformation or an initially low tumorigenicity, and (ii) clones that were rapidly transformed showing an initially high tumorigenicity. The <b>glycopeptides</b> were removed from the cell surface by trypsin and, after Pronase digestion, were examined by filtration through Sephadex G- 50. With delayed transformation, a specific group of <b>glycopeptides</b> was increasingly evident over an 85 -day period as the cells showed phenotypic properties of transformation and the ability to form tumors. In the other series, all but one clone of hamster embryo cells showed rapid transformation after infection with polyoma virus. This clone was less tumorigenic and showed little of the specific <b>glycopeptides.</b> In all cases of delayed or rapid transformation examined, the specific group of <b>glycopeptides</b> increased proportionately to the ability of the cells to form tumors.

It is routine to determine the site-specific glycosylation of nonsialylated N-glycoproteins from a single gel spot, but some obstacles still exist in analyzing sialylated glycoproteins due to the lability and higher detection limit of acid glycans in MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis. Thus, we present an improved protocol here. Tryptic <b>glycopeptides</b> were separated and subjected to MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis, resulting in the identification of site-specific glycosylation of high-intensity <b>glycopeptides.</b> Sequential deglycosylation and desialylation were used to improve the identification of glycosylation sites and desialylated glycans.

40|$|Glycoprotein {{structure}} {{determination and}} quantification by MS requires efficient isolation of <b>glycopeptides</b> from a proteolytic digest of complex protein mixtures.

The elution order of nonglycopeptides relative to <b>glycopeptides</b> in IP-NPLC is predictable by their hydrophobicity values calculated using the Wimley-White water/octanol hydrophobicity scale. Olinked <b>glycopeptides</b> can be efficiently isolated from fetuin tryptic digests using IP-NPLC when N-glycans are first removed with PNGase.

Essentially all of the [3 H]mannose-labelled asparaginyl-oligosaccharides from the 'single-mutant' cells selected for resistance to phytohaemagglutinin and the 'double-mutant' cells selected for additional resistance to concanavalin A were not bound to lentil lectin, whereas approximately one-sixth of the parental-cell <b>glycopeptides</b> were bound and specifically eluted with alpha-methyl mannoside.
