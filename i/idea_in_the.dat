5|$|A common <b>idea</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> comics is that Bruce saw a Zorro {{film with}} his parents before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
5|$|Jonze {{conceived}} the <b>idea</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 2000s after reading {{an article about}} a website that allowed for instant messaging with an artificial intelligence program. After making I'm Here (2010), a short film sharing similar themes, Jonze returned to the idea. He wrote {{the first draft of}} the script in five months. Principal photography took place in Los Angeles and Shanghai in mid-2012. The role of Samantha was recast in post-production, with Samantha Morton being replaced with Johansson. Additional scenes were filmed in August 2013 following the casting change.|$|E

5|$|On 2 December 1972, Holt's {{government}} was voted {{out as the}} Labor Party took the majority in Canberra. The new prime minister was Gough Whitlam and new postmaster-general was Doug McClelland. In early 1973, {{in an effort to}} foster a more independent organisation, Madgwick asked Whitlam if the ABC's employees could be removed from the Public Service Board, which administered the Commonwealth government employment system. Although Whitlam had supported the <b>idea</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, he now opposed it as prime minister and did not act on Madgwick's request.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} further {{promoted}} {{on her first}} headlining tour, The Virgin Tour, which only visited cities in the United States and Canada. Early on there were plans to schedule dates in England and Japan due to Madonna's large fan base in both countries. However, the final schedule did not reflect the <b>idea.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end several more US dates were added and moved to larger concert venues due to overwhelmingly strong ticket sales.|$|E
5|$|After {{the medieval}} period, the word elf tended to become less common {{throughout}} the Germanic languages, losing out to alternative native terms like zwerc ("dwarf") in German and huldra ("hidden being") in Scandinavian languages, and to loan-words like fairy (borrowed from French {{into all the}} Germanic languages). Still, beliefs in elves persisted in the early modern period, particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia, where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly, alongside everyday human communities. They continued {{to be associated with}} causing illness and with sexual threats. For example, a number of early modern ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters. With urbanisation and industrialisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beliefs in elves declined rapidly (though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves). However, from the early modern period onwards, elves started to be prominent in the literature and art of educated elites. These literary elves were imagined as small, impish beings, with Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream being a key development of this <b>idea.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century, German Romanticist writers were influenced by this notion of the elf, and reimported the English word elf into the German language.|$|E

5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious <b>idea</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E
5|$|The Jiuzhang suanshu {{was perhaps}} the most {{groundbreaking}} of the three surviving Han treatises. It is the first known book to feature negative numbers, along with the Bakhshali manuscript (200 CE?– 600 CE?) of India and the book of the Greek mathematician Diophantus (fl. 3rd century) written in about 275 CE. Negative numbers appeared as black counting rods, while positive numbers appeared as red counting rods. Although the decimal system existed in China since the Shang dynasty (c. 1600– c. 1050 BCE), the earliest evidence of a decimal fraction (i.e. the denominator is a power of ten) is an inscription on a standard volume-measuring vessel dated 5 CE and used by the mathematician and astronomer Liu Xin (46 BCE– 23 CE). Yet the first book to feature decimal fractions was the Jiuzhang suanshu, as a means to solve equations and represent measurements. Gaussian elimination, an algorithm used to solve linear equations, was known as the Array Rule in the Jiuzhang suanshu. While the book used continued fractions to find the roots of equations, Liu Hui built on this <b>idea</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 3rd century when he increased the decimals to find the cube root of 1,860,867 (yielding the answer 123), the same method used in the Horner scheme named after William George Horner (1786–1837).|$|E

25|$|Within ghost {{hunting and}} parapsychology, {{electronic}} voice phenomena (EVP) are sounds found on elctronic recordings that are interpreted as spirit voices {{that have been}} either unintentionally recorded or intentionally requested and recorded.

25|$|The disc {{companies}} had superior advertising and promotion, {{most notably the}} Victor Talking Machine Company in the United States and the Gramophone Company/HMV in the Commonwealth.

25|$|The {{essential}} <b>idea</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Boussinesq approximation is {{the elimination}} of the vertical coordinate from the flow equations, while retaining some of the influences of the vertical structure of the flow under water waves. This is useful because the waves propagate in the horizontal plane and have a different (not wave-like) behaviour in the vertical direction. Often, as in Boussinesq's case, the interest is primarily in the wave propagation.|$|E

There have been no significant reports of problems in this area, but Lonely Planet advises proper research before pursuing such an <b>idea.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> city of Cali about 50,000 (2010) cosmetic surgery procedures occur per year, of which around 14,000 involve patients from abroad.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{his efforts}} to revitalize the area, Moses first {{proposed}} the extension of Fifth Avenue through Washington Square Park in 1935.

Moses argued that the Fifth Avenue extension would improve the flow of traffic through the neighborhood and provide access to the planned Lower Manhattan Expressway (LOMEX), which would connect the Manhattan Bridge and Williamsburg Bridge with the Holland Tunnel.|$|E
