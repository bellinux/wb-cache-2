25|$|Delayed by <b>head</b> <b>winds</b> and fogs, M. Allemand did {{not enter}} the bay of Castles until 22 September, by which time most of the fishing vessels had {{departed}} for Europe. The French commodore sent an officer with a flag of truce demanding the surrender of the town. This was refused, but {{the approach of the}} squadron compelled the British commanding officer to destroy the fishing-stages.|$|E
25|$|The {{part of the}} {{expedition}} that took place over land took about 40–51 days to get to San Diego. The contingent coming by sea encountered the south flowing California Current and strong <b>head</b> <b>winds,</b> and were still straggling in three months after they set sail. After their arduous journeys, {{most of the men}} aboard the ships were ill, chiefly from scurvy, and many had died. Out of a total of about 219 men who had left Baja California, little more than 100 survived. The survivors established the Presidio of San Diego on May 14, 1769. Mission San Diego de Alcala was established on July 16, 1769. As the first of the presidios and Spanish missions in California, they provided the base of operations for the Spanish colonization of Alta California (present-day California).|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the tea season was {{during the early stages}} of the South-West monsoon in the China Sea, so <b>head</b> <b>winds</b> would be experienced, and very light or {{variable}} winds together with sudden squalls. Many captains sailing for the Sunda Strait therefore chose to head westward to the coast of Annam (present day Vietnam) to pick up land breezes. This involved tacking at the most favourable moment to be close inshore for the {{start of the}} land breeze, often in the middle of the night. Crossing to the Annam coast meant passing the Paracels, an area of low-lying islands and reefs which presented obvious dangers. From the coast of Annam, the usual route was to head south to the coast of Borneo, again to take advantage of land and sea breezes.|$|E

25|$|In 1688, the {{governor}} Jacques-René de Brisay de Denonville {{gave him the}} concession of the seigniory (estate) of Les Douacques (which later became the town of Bar Harbor, Maine, well known today as a tourist town, but then for fishing and lobsters). His concession brought him no income, even from agriculture. Lamothe entered into a trading partnership with officers of Port Royal, an activity facilitated by using a ship owned by his brothers-in-law Guyon. In 1689, he was sent on an expedition {{in the vicinity of}} Boston. Upon his return, he asked {{the governor}} of Acadia, Louis-Alexandre des Friches de Méneval, for a job as notary, to bring in a minimum income; his request was turned down. Then, Cadillac was introduced to the governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac in Quebec, who sent him on an exploratory mission along the coasts of New England, aboard the frigate L'Embuscade (The Ambush). Strong <b>head</b> <b>winds</b> forced the ship to return to France.|$|E
500|$|The race {{started on}} Saturday 24 March 1877 at 8:27 a.m. [...] Oxford {{had won the}} toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. The Dark Blues took an early lead and were ahead at the Mile Post, but by the Crab Tree pub, the crews were level. [...] Cambridge pulled ahead and held a quarter-of-a-length lead by Hammersmith Bridge which they {{extended}} until the crews arrived at Chiswick Reach where Oxford re-took the lead. [...] At Chiswick Steps the Dark Blues were leading by half-a-length, and by Barnes Bridge they were clear. [...] Experiencing strong <b>head</b> <b>winds</b> and rough water, Cowles, the Oxford bow man, suffered serious damage to his oar, nullifying further contribution to the race. [...] Described by an Oxford undergraduate watching the race: [...] "suddenly Oxford staggered and stood still in a mass of foam: the bow-oar, Cowles, had struck the top of a big wave in feathering and broken his blade clean off." [...] Almost immediately, Cambridge took the advantage, but were held off by a determined Oxford crew who [...] "spurted magnificently and drew up steadily inch by inch, so that it was a near thing as they passed the post".|$|E
500|$|No 49 Squadron {{had eight}} Valiants, but only four deployed: XD818, piloted by Wing Commander Kenneth Hubbard, the {{squadron}} commander; XD822, piloted by Squadron Leader L. D. (Dave) Roberts; XD823, piloted by Squadron Leader Arthur Steele; and XD824, piloted by Squadron Leader Barney Millett. The other four Valiants remained at RAF Wittering, {{where they were}} used as courier aircraft for bomb components. The last components for Short Granite were delivered by Valiant courier on 10 May 1957—three days late owing to severe <b>head</b> <b>winds</b> between San Francisco and Honolulu. A full-scale rehearsal was held on 11 May, and on 14 May {{it was decided to}} conduct the Grapple 1 test the following day. The eight official observers—two each from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States—were flown from Honolulu to Christmas Island in a Handley Page Hastings, then to Malden Island in a Dakota, from whence a DUKW took them out to HMS Alert, the spectator ship. All but a small party were evacuated from Malden by HMS Warrior, Narvik and Messina by 19:00 on 14 May. The rest were picked up by a helicopter from Warrior at 07:45 on 15 May. Oulton and Cook arrived on Malden by Dakota at 08:25, where they were met by a helicopter and taken to Narvik.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the extreme}} cases {{springing}} may cause severe fatigue cracking of critical structural details, especially in moderate to rough head seas with low peak periods. Vibration is normally more easily excited by waves {{in ballast condition}} than in cargo condition. The converse may also be true since some ships experience more <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> and waves in ballast conditions, while other ships may experience more <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> and waves in cargo condition, thereby vibrating less overall.|$|R

2500|$|On 3 October 1943 {{while serving}} with 255 Sqn, Berry was {{involved}} in the [...] "Great E-Boat Raid" [...] at Cos, Greece. Sixty aircraft were involved; several Beaufighter squadrons and one Beafort squadron attacked the German Invasion Force North of the Allied occupied Island. The German invasion force consisted of several large vessels used as troop ships, destroyers, e-boats and landing barges. The attack had mixed results due to heavy enemy fire and bad weather with <b>head</b> <b>winds</b> on the return journey; the Squadrons took overall losses of 27%. The Beaufighter had a range of 370 miles, and due to heavy fuel consumption 25 got back, most of the others ditched or were shot down.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{one reason}} Florida never {{became a part}} of Georgia might be found in the vagaries of the wind. [...] May 13, 1777 was the date picked for Elbert and Baker to combine their forces and drive back the British. [...] Many {{problems}} prevented Elbert’s sea expedition from reaching its destination on time. [...] While on the boats, the men were stricken by disease, which combined with supply problems and <b>head</b> <b>winds,</b> slowed their progress considerably. [...] In addition, the waters in this area are relatively low in the spring, making navigation somewhat difficult. [...] On May 30, Elbert {{wrote in a letter to}} his brother in law, Colonel Joseph Habersham, [...] "could we have got the Galleys into St. John’s river, I would, with the men I have with me, made the whole province of East Florida tumble." ...|$|E

60|$|For {{about ten}} days after the brig Miranda left Valparaiso she had good winds and fair weather, and her {{progress}} was satisfactory to all on board, {{but at the end}} of that time she entered upon a season of <b>head</b> <b>winds</b> and bad weather. The vessel behaved very well in the stormy days that followed, but she made very little headway. Her course was now laid toward the Gulf of Penas, after reaching which she would sail along the protected waterways between the chain of islands which lie along the coast and the mainland, and which lead into the Straits of Magellan.|$|E
60|$|The sailors took much {{pleasure}} in the deck-tub performances of the O'Regans, and greatly admired them always for their archness and activity; but the tranquil O'Briens they did not fancy so much.

To that, and the incantations muttered over it, they ascribed the <b>head</b> <b>winds</b> that haunted us; and Blunt, our Irish cockney, really believed that Mrs. O'Brien purposely came on deck every morning, in order to secure a foul wind for the next ensuing twenty-four hours.|$|E

It might be recognized, he said, by a great island that runs out beyond the rest and on which is 'an hill fashioned as it were an heap of corn.' The 'goodly gulf' is Pillage Bay in the district of Saguenay, and the hill is Mount Ste Genevieve.|$|E

Very like you all know Bruges, gentlemen, a queer, old-fashioned Flemish town, once they say a great place for trade and money-making, in old times, when the Mynheers were in their glory; but almost as large and as empty as an Irishman's pocket at the present day.|$|E
40|$|The {{longitudinal}} equations {{of motion}} with wind shear terms were {{used to analyze the}} stability and motions of a jet transport. A positive wind shear gives a decreasing <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> or changes a <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> into a tail wind. A negative wind shear gives a decreasing tail wind or changes a tail <b>wind</b> into a <b>head</b> <b>wind.</b> It was found that wind shear had very little effect on the short period mode and that negative wind shear, although it affected the phugoid, did not cause stability problems. On the other hand, it was found that positive wind shear can cause the phugoid to become aperiodic and unstable. In this case, a stability boundary for the phugoid was found that is valid for most aircraft at all flight speeds. Calculations of aircraft motions confirmed the results of the stability analysis. It was found that a flight path control automatic pilot and an airspeed control system provide good control in all types of wind shear. Appendixes give {{equations of motion}} that include the effects of downdrafts and updrafts and extend the longitudinal equations of motion for shear to six degrees of freedom...|$|R
