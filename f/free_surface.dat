5|$|In 1883, {{oil tanker}} design took a large step forward. Working for the Nobel company, British {{engineer}} Colonel Henry F. Swan designed {{a set of}} three Nobel tankers. Instead {{of one or two}} large holds, Swan's design used several holds which spanned the width, or beam, of the ship. These holds were further subdivided into port and starboard sections by a longitudinal bulkhead. Earlier designs suffered from stability problems caused by the <b>free</b> <b>surface</b> effect, where oil sloshing from side to side could cause a ship to capsize. But this approach of dividing the ship's storage space into smaller tanks virtually eliminated free-surface problems. This approach, almost universal today, was first used by Swan in the Nobel tankers Blesk, Lumen, and Lux.|$|E

40|$|For {{almost all}} n-type zinc-blende III-V {{semiconductor}} <b>free</b> <b>surfaces</b> a depletion layer is observed. InAs is an exception, since n-type InAs <b>free</b> <b>surfaces</b> exhibit electron accumulation, due to donorlike surface states which pin the Fermi level {{far above the}} conduction band minimum.

The Fermi-level pinning mechanism at <b>free</b> <b>surfaces</b> is discussed in terms of the position of the bulk Fermi level with respect to the branch-point energy (E-B). Depending on the location of the bulk Fermi level, amphoteric defects are incorporated into the surface, which if ionized facilitate the band bending that results in the surface Fermi level becoming pinned close to E-B.

40|$|International audienceFree surface {{effects on}} the {{thermodynamics}} and glass formation in simple monatomic supercooled liquids with the Lennard-Jones-Gauss interaction potential were studied by the molecular dynamics simulations. Glass with two <b>free</b> <b>surfaces</b> was obtained by cooling from the melt. We found the following important new results: <b>Free</b> <b>surfaces</b> significantly enhance atomic mobility in the system {{compared to that of}} the bulk and induce the formation of so-called layer structure of the interior of both liquid and glassy states. A mobile surface layer in the system exists for a wide temperature range; i. e., the thickness of the mobile surface layer and the discrepancy between atomic mobility in the surface and that in the interior have a tendency to increase with temperature. The atomic mechanism of glass formation in supercooled liquids with <b>free</b> <b>surfaces</b> exhibits "heterogeneouslike" behavior, unlike the "homogeneous" behavior observed in the bulk; i. e., the solidlike "domain" initiates/enhances in the interior and simultaneously grows outward to the surface to form a glassy solid phase. The interior of glass with <b>free</b> <b>surfaces</b> exhibits a stronger local icosahedral order compared to that of the bulk, and it may lead to higher stability of the glassy state compared to that of the latter. In contrast, the surface shell has a more porous structure and contains a large number of undercoordinated sites...|$|R
