Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials managed to escape abroad and started to form the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force.|$|E

However, Michael was fired before the Yankees dynasty began, {{as a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>fallouts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1994 strike, which ruined the Yankees having {{the best record in the}} American League that year in 1995. It was the second time that the Yankees fired Michael {{as a result of}} a strike; in 1981, he was fired as manager as a result of the strike that year.|$|R

5|$|On 16 August 2011, the Irish Examiner {{reported}} that Micheál Martin {{had moved to}} pull the party out of the presidential race over the <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> approach to Gay Byrne, the cost involved and the slim chance of a candidate being elected. On 24 August, however, the party's deputy leader Éamon Ó Cuív told Raidió na Gaeltachta that he believed the party should put forward a candidate.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} formally {{requested a}} permanent test facility on 30 October 1953. Due to concerns about nuclear <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> previous tests at Emu Field and the site's inadequate infrastructure and water supply, the recently surveyed Maralinga site {{was selected for}} this purpose. The new site was announced in May 1955. It was developed as a joint, co-funded facility between the British and Australian governments.|$|E

The best game-playing strategy leads to a significant reduction of the huge search space for both formula generation and solving. (2) The Evergreen Game shows us how to systematically translate a CSP formula into a polynomial that is fundamental in playing the game well. (3) We show evidence that those polynomials are useful for efficient MAX-CSP as well as MAX-SAT solvers...|$|R
5|$|The {{launch of}} the Expedition 1 crew {{occurred}} {{a week before the}} United States presidential election, so it got little attention in the United States. At the time of the mission, the station was expected to be completed in 2006, and be continuously inhabited until at least 2015. Due to several delays, including the <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, the station was completed in late 2011, thanks to STS-134.|$|E
5|$|As a Republican {{representing}} heavily-Democratic Maryland, Mathias faced {{a potentially}} difficult re-election {{bid for the}} 1974 election. State Democrats nominated Barbara Mikulski, then a Baltimore City Councilwoman who was well-known to residents in her city as a social activist, but with limited name recognition {{in the rest of}} the state. Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election challenge from conservative doctor Ross Pierpont. Pierpont was never a substantial threat to Mathias, whose lack of competition was due in part to <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Watergate scandal.|$|E

The test was carried out on November 1, 1952 at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and was the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium, , which could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two beta decays.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, Gingrich {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office as the Republican candidate in , which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, {{but was unable to}} overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him. He did well against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Watergate scandal of the Nixon administration.|$|E

Also in July, Michael Douglas and executives from Marvel Entertainment rang the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange {{in celebration of}} the release of Ant-Man. Disney spent $34.8 million on television advertising for the film, more than the $26.9 million spent for Avengers: Age of Ultron, since the former was a new property.|$|E
5|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{radioactive}} lanthanum were dispersed by the explosions; 254 tests were performed between 1944 and 1961. In 1948 two workers received radiation burns there. The experiments were generally performed {{when the wind}} blew to the north, but occasionally the wind would change direction in the early morning. In 1949 and 1950 the nuclear <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tests was blown over parts of the housing area and a road; the radiation levels on the road occasionally reached 5-10mR/h and the road had to be closed for a while.|$|E
50|$|Matayoshi {{was born}} in Kwajalein. His father, Woodrow Matayoshi, was a second-generation Japanese American from Hawaii, whose parents were {{immigrants}} from Okinawa. Matayoshi's mother, Almira Ainri, was a Marshallese from Rongelap and was an activist on issues pertaining to nuclear warfare until her death in June 2005. In her youth, Ainri was exposed to radioactive <b>fallouts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nuclear bomb tests, which left her with thyroid problems {{for the rest of}} her life. Two of Matayoshi's older siblings, Robert and Alex also suffered from thyroid problems as a result of the nuclear bomb tests. Ainri also suffered a miscarriage in 1955 which resulted in a stillborn child without a skeleton. In his youth, Matayoshi was educated in Hawaii, but returned to the Marshall Islands and was elected as Rongelap's mayor in 1995.|$|R

5|$|The Germans had not developed, {{and did not}} employ {{radioactive}} poisons, so Operation Peppermint {{was never}} put into effect. After VE-Day, the equipment and all the documents relating to Operation Peppermint were collected, returned to the United States, and {{handed over to the}} Manhattan Project. However, the effort put into developing portable radiation detection equipment was not wasted. Survey teams from the Manhattan Project used the equipment to assess the <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Trinity nuclear test, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Operation Crossroads, during which 10,000 film badges were used.|$|E
5|$|Because works {{critical}} of {{the leadership of the}} Chinese regime are considered sensitive, Gui always kept his work projects secret; he kept his movements to himself and his telephone calls were re-routed through foreign countries. He went a long period without entering China; he did not visit his father when the latter was ill, and did not return to China for his father's funeral. Media sources reported that Gui had published about half of the popular books written on Bo Xilai. When Bo was caught in the political <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Wang Lijun incident in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10million from the surge in book sales. Gui's publishing financed his property acquisitions in Hong Kong and Germany, including a seaside retreat in Pattaya, Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{negative}} impact on Bertuzzi's individual play, the media speculated that the <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Moore incident had become a distraction to the organization as a whole. Compounding the situation in Vancouver, the Canucks had missed {{the playoffs for the}} first time in four years. As such, general manager Dave Nonis spent the off-season making significant changes to the Canucks lineup. On June 23, 2006, he traded Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers, along with goaltender Alex Auld and defenceman Bryan Allen, in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo, defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth-round selection in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft (Sergei Shirokov). After seven-and-a-half seasons with the Canucks, Bertuzzi left the club ranked seventh all-time among franchise scoring leaders with 449 points.|$|E
50|$|The authors {{suggest that}} most of the deaths were in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, though others {{occurred}} worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> Chernobyl. <b>The</b> literature analysis draws on over 1000 published titles and over 5000 internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.
