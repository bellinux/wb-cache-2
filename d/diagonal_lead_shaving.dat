40|$|Abstract Background Hierarchical {{clustering}} is {{a widely}} applied tool {{in the analysis of}} microarray gene expression data. The assessment of cluster stability is a major challenge in clustering procedures. Statistical methods are required to distinguish between real and random clusters. Several methods for assessing cluster stability have been published, including resampling methods such as the bootstrap. We propose a new resampling method based on continuous weights to assess the stability of clusters in hierarchical clustering. While in bootstrapping approximately one third of the original items is lost, continuous weights avoid zero elements and instead allow non integer <b>diagonal</b> elements, which <b>leads</b> to retention of the full dimensionality of space, i. e. each variable of the original data set is represented in the resampling sample. Results Comparison of continuous weights and bootstrapping using real datasets and simulation studies reveals the advantage of continuous weights especially when the dataset has only few observations, few differentially expressed genes and the fold change of differentially expressed genes is low. Conclusion We recommend the use of continuous weights in small as well as in large datasets, because according to our results they produce at least the same results as conventional bootstrapping and in some cases they surpass it. </p...|$|R
40|$|General {{software}} for preconditioning the iterative solution of linear systems is greatly lagging behind the literature. This {{is partly because}} specific problems need specific matrix and preconditioner data structures {{in order to be}} solved efficiently; i. e., multiple implementations of a preconditioner with specialized data structures are required. This article presents a framework to support preconditioning with various, possibly user-defined, data structures for matrices that are partitioned into blocks. The main idea is to define data structures for the blocks, and an upper layer of software which uses these blocks transparently of their data structure. This transparency can be accomplished by using an object-oriented language. Thus various preconditioners, such as block relaxations and block incomplete factorizations, only need to be defined once, and will work with any block type. In addition, it is possible to transparently interchange various approximate or exact techniques for inverting pivot blocks, or solving systems whose coefficient matrices are <b>diagonal</b> blocks. This <b>leads</b> to a rich variety of preconditioners that can be selected. Operations with the blocks are performed with optimized libraries or fundamental data types.
