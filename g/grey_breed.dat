40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to apply {{mid-infrared}} spectroscopy prediction models developed for milk coagulation properties (MCP) to a spectral dataset of 123, 240 records collected over a 2 -year period in the Alpine area, and to investigate sources of variation of the predicted MCP. Mixed linear models included fixed effects of breed, month and year of sampling, days in milk, parity, and the interactions between the main effects. Random effects were herd nested within breed, cow nested within breed, and the residual. All fixed effects were significant (P< 0. 01) in explaining the variation of MCP. In particular, milk clotting characteristics varied significantly among breeds, and local Alpine <b>Grey</b> <b>breed</b> exhibited the most favourable processing characteristics. Milk coagulation properties varied across lactation and were at their worst after the peak...|$|E

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of Heat Shock Protein 70. 2 mRNA is also {{regulated by the}} Upper Promoter elements of the gene. This promoter region is polymorphic in cattle. These polymorphisms have a major effect on {{the activity of the}} mRNA transcription. In a comparison of quantity of transcribed mRNA from the wild type and AP 2 mutant allele the wild type can produce 2 – 3 -fold more transcripts. The Hungarian Grey Cattle (HG) and Norwegian Red (NFR) as control breed were genotyped with PCR-RFLP method. Our results showed that the frequencies of alleles in breeds (p(wt) HG = 0. 859419, p(wt) NFR = 0. 5) are different. The effective response to heat stress in the Norwegian Red seems to be less important than in the Hungarian <b>Grey</b> <b>breed.</b> The extensive keeping in hot and arid region during centuries could have been proved as selection pressure for the heat tolerance.

40|$|Consumer’s quality {{perception}} {{has changed}} in the last years and healthy aspects {{are becoming more and more}} relevant. Cow milk is an important source of minerals, especially Ca, K, Mg, Na, and P. Large-scale monitoring of milk mineral content is difficult due to expensive and time-consuming reference analyses, and therefore phenotyping of these traits at the population level is hardly achievable. Aim of the present study was to investigate sources of variation of milk Ca, K, Mg, Na, and P, predicted by mid-infrared spectroscopy models developed after uninformative variables elimination, on a large multi-breed spectral dataset (n= 123, 240). Cattle breeds considered were Holstein-Friesian, Brown Swiss, Alpine Grey, and Simmental. Sources of variation were studied using mixed models, including the fixed effects of breed, month and year of sampling, days in milk, parity, and the interactions between the main effects. Random factors were herd nested within breed, cow nested within breed, and the residual. All fixed effects were highly significant (P< 0. 01) in explaining the variation of milk mineral concentration. Milk of Simmental cows exhibited the greatest concentration of minerals. Alpine <b>Grey</b> <b>breed</b> had greater concentration of Ca and P compared to HF. These aspects could be important for a valorization of local breeds. Variation of concentration of Ca, Mg, Na, and P across lactation was significant and it exhibited an opposite trend to that of milk yield, with the lowest values around the peak of lactation. On the contrary, K concentration resembled the trend of milk yield...|$|E
40|$|Title of the paper: Influence {{of feeding}} on {{fattening}} performance and carcass quality of young Hungarian Grey and Holstein Friesian bulls The {{aim of this}} study was to analyse the effect of nutrition, genotype and nutrition x genotype interaction on growth performance and carcass quality using Hungarian Grey cattle bulls (HG) in comparison to Holstein Friesian bulls (HF) kept under extensive and intensive conditions. In groups extensive and intensive days on feed lasted for 221 and 201, respectively. Higher relative growth rate was recorded in Hungarian Grey than Holstein Friesian in extensively fed group and higher final weights were recorded in intensive groups compared to extensive groups. Differences between genotypes were not different. Carcass weight and length, amount of perinephric and trimmed fat were higher in intensive groups as well. Higher lean meat content in carcass was measured in Hungarian <b>Grey</b> <b>breed.</b> For treatments extensive and intensive means were 71, 0 % and 67, 5 %, respectively. The ratio of bone in carcass varied in line with the four feet percentage and weight. Similarly to the ratio of perinephric and trimmed fat, the amount of fat in carcass was lower in extensively fed groups, which proves the varied effect of different feeding. The tissue composition of carcass can be analysed by Computer-Tomography (CT) - examination of prime rib samples. These results are more representative as the EUROP-classification of evaluation for carcass quality. Findings reveal that considerations on the utilization of the native HG breed on development of novel beef cattle production systems especially on roughage-based diets seems to be justified...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the relationship among the analysed Podolic breeds and to verify whether their genetic state reﬂects their history. To do so, approximately 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped on individuals belonging to these breeds and compared to genotypes of individuals of two Italian beef breeds, Marchigiana and Piemontese, which underwent different selection and migration histories. Population genetic parameters such as allelic frequencies and heterozygosity values were assessed, genetic distances calculated and assignment test performed to evaluate the possibility of recent admixture between the populations. The data show that the physical similarity among the Podolic breeds examined, and particularly between Hungarian Grey and Maremmana cattle that experienced admixture in the recent past, is mainly morphological. The assignment of individuals from genotype data was achieved using Bayesian inference, conﬁrming that the set of chosen SNPs is able to distinguish among the breeds and that the breeds are genetically distinct. Individuals of Turkish <b>Grey</b> <b>breed</b> were clearly assigned to their breed of origin for all clustering alternatives, showing that this breed can be differentiated from the others on the basis of the allelic frequencies. Remarkably, in the Turkish Grey there were differences observed between the population of Enez district, where in situ conservation studies are practised, and that of Bandirma district of Balikesir, where ex situ conservation studies are practised out of the original raising area. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that molecular data could be used to reveal an unbiased view of past events and provide the basis for a rational exploitation of livestock, suggesting appropriate cross-breeding plans based on genetic distance or breeding strategies that include the population structure.

40|$|The Eastern European Grey cattle are {{regarded}} as the direct descendants of the aurochs (Bos taurus primigenius). Nowadays in Romania, less than 100 Grey animals are being reared and included in the national gene reserve. We examined the genetic diversity among Romanian Grey, Brown, Spotted and Black and White cattle breeds, with a particular focus on Romanian Grey {{through the use of}} (i) 11 bovine specific microsatellite markers on 83 animals and (ii) 638 bp length of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop region sequence data from a total of 81 animals. Both microsatellite and mtDNA analysis revealed a high level of genetic variation in the studied breeds. In Romanian Grey a total of 100 alleles were found, the mean number of observed alleles per locus was 9. 091; the average observed heterozygosity was 0. 940; the Wright's fixation index (FIS) was negative (- 0. 189) and indicates that there is no inbreeding and no selection pressure. MtDNA analysis revealed 52 haplotypes with 67 variable sites among the Romanian cattle breeds without any insertion or deletion. Haplotype diversity was 0. 980 ± 0. 007 and ranged from 0. 883 ± 0. 056 (Brown) to 0. 990 ± 0. 028 (Spotted and Black and White). The highest genetic variability of the mtDNA was recorded in the <b>Grey</b> <b>breed,</b> where 18 haplotypes were identified. The most frequent mtDNA D-loop region belonged to T 3 haplogroup (80. 247 %), which was found across all studied breeds, while T 2 haplotypes (16. 049 %) was only found in Grey, Spotted and Black and White genotypes. The T 1 haplotypes (3. 704 %) were found in the Grey and Spotted. The current results contribute to the general knowledge on genetic diversity found in Eastern European cattle breeds and could prove a valuable tool for the conservation efforts of animal genetic resources (FAnGR) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the effect of breed, season, age and weight of doe at mating on reproductive performance of 4 broiler rabbit <b>breeds,</b> <b>Grey</b> Giant, White Giant, Soviet Chinchilla, and New Zealand White, reared under standard management practices in sub-temperate climatic conditions of India. They were first mated at 6 to 7 mo of age, whereupon an extensive breeding system (re-mating after weaning) was followed. Weaning was done 42 d after kindling. The data from the records on reproduction consisting of 503 matings and 377 kindlings were analysed. The parameters considered were fertility rate, litter size at birth (LSB), litter weight at birth (LWB), litter size at weaning (LSW), litter weight at weaning (LWW), doe weight at mating (DWM), gestation length and sex ratio. Among 4 breeds, the LSB, LWB and LSW were higher in Grey Giant followed by White Giant, Soviet Chinchilla and New Zealand White. The LSB and LSW in <b>Grey</b> Giant <b>breed</b> differed significantly (P< 0. 05) from Soviet Chinchilla and New Zealand White. Season had significant (P< 0. 05) effect on LSW with higher values during spring (5. 68 ± 0. 24), followed by summer (5. 29 ± 0. 30), winter (5. 13 ± 0. 25) and autumn (4. 17 ± 0. 49). The body weight of doe at service significantly influenced fertility. The fertility increased as body weight increased. The age of the doe at mating had a significant effect on LSW, with higher values for does more than 2 yr and less than 1 yr old compared to 1 - to 2 -yr old does. The parity did not affect any of the parameters studied.
