5|$|During {{the medieval}} and post-medieval periods the {{township}} of Altrincham {{was part of}} Bowdon parish. Low population density meant that the town {{did not have a}} church until the Anglican church established a chapel of ease in 1799. Nonconformists were also present in Altrincham; Methodists set up a chapel in 1790, and Baptists built one in the 1870s. Irish <b>immigrants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1830s and 1840s also returned Roman Catholicism to the area, the first Roman Catholic church built in Altrincham being St Vincent's, in 1860.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the true}} {{second wave of}} {{immigration}} did not begin until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 abolished national origins quotas. After the passage of that act, Armenians from the Soviet Union, Turkey, Lebanon, Iran and other Middle Eastern countries began migrating in large numbers, many fleeing political instability in their host countries. In the 1950s, most Armenian <b>immigrants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US were from Soviet Armenia and Turkey. The Istanbul pogrom in 1955 frightened the local Turkish Armenian population, which looked to the West for a safe and more prosperous life.|$|E

5|$|Earlier, Cotillo {{had opposed}} the anti-immigration {{restrictions}} of the Immigration Act of 1924 that significantly limited immigration from Italy. In 1931, Cotillo protested against unnecessary stringent {{requirements of a}} proposed registration law, particularly the requirement of {{the equivalent of a}} public school education and the fingerprinting of applicants. A naturalized citizen had the same rights as native-born and fingerprinting would make the foreign applicant feel like a criminal, Cotillo pointed out. He referred to the findings of the Wickersham Commission that the foreign-born committed considerably less crime than native citizens. He also attacked the revocation of citizenship because of evil doing, while a native born was not affected. At the time, Cotillo claimed to have naturalized some 25,000 <b>immigrants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eight years he had been on the bench.|$|E
5|$|Tension between {{whites and}} Chinese <b>immigrants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century American West was {{particularly}} high, {{especially in the}} decade preceding the violence. The massacre in Rock Springs was the violent outburst of years of anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act suspended Chinese immigration for ten years, but not before thousands of immigrants came to the American West. Most Chinese immigrants to Wyoming Territory took jobs with the railroad at first, but many ended up employed in coal mines owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. As Chinese immigration increased, so did anti-Chinese sentiment from whites. The Knights of Labor, {{one of the foremost}} voices against Chinese immigrant labor, formed a chapter in Rock Springs in 1883, and most rioters were members of that organization. However, no direct connection was ever established linking the riot to the national Knights of Labor organization.|$|E
