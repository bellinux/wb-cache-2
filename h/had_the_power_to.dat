5|$|An {{amendment}} to the Articles had been proposed by Thomas Burke, in February 1781, to give Congress the power to collect a 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782. Madison joined Hamilton in persuading Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind. Their report recommending the delegation argued the federal government needed not just some level of financial autonomy, but also {{the ability to make}} laws that superseded those of the individual states. Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> tax, since it <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> fix the sums due from the several states; but Virginia's rescission of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{received}} a ten-year sentence, the maximum sentence the judge <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> impose. The sentences {{received by the}} other defendants ranged from four years to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment. By {{the end of the}} trial the total cost of the Strangeways riot, including refurbishing the prison and the costs of the police inquiry and court case, had reached £112million.|$|E
5|$|With {{the crisis}} unresolved, Kerr decided to dismiss Whitlam as prime minister. Fearing that Whitlam {{would go to}} the Queen and {{potentially}} have him removed, the Governor-General gave Whitlam no prior hint. He conferred (against Whitlam's advice) with High Court Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, who agreed that he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> dismiss Whitlam.|$|E

50|$|The 1945 Constitution: <b>The</b> {{president}} <b>has</b> {{constitutional authority}} over <b>the</b> Government and <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> name and remove ministers. He <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> create laws with {{the agreement of}} the People's Representative Council (DPR), to make Government regulations in accordance with laws, {{and in the case}} of emergencies <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> make Government regulations in lieu of law. Militarily, the president holds supreme authority over the Army, Navy, and Air Force whilst security-wise, <b>the</b> president <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> declare a State of Emergency. Diplomatically, the president, with the agreement of <b>the</b> DPR, <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> declare war, peace, and to sign treaties. In addition, he or she appoints ambassadors and consuls as well as accepting ambassadors from other countries. Finally, <b>the</b> president <b>has</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> give amnesties and pardons as well as awarding titles and honours.|$|R
50|$|The {{governor}} {{is head of}} the government of Puerto Rico. He <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> veto any number of projects that the Puerto Rican Legislature wishes to pass. <b>The</b> governor also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> appoint <b>the</b> members of his cabinet, who in turn must be ratified by the Legislature. <b>The</b> governor also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> appoint Justices to the Supreme Court and all the lower courts of the island.|$|R
5|$|During the Great Depression, three {{important}} United States Supreme Court cases were decided which determined {{the constitutionality of}} New Deal measures, one of which originated in the Eastern District of Missouri. The case, originally filed as Norman v. B & O Railroad, reached the Supreme Court along with two cases filed in the United States Court of Claims, under the single heading of the Gold Clause Cases. The Supreme Court upheld {{the determination of the}} trial court judge, Charles Breckenridge Faris, who found that Congress <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> prohibit parties from contracting for payment in gold.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Zara Yaqob also {{continued}} as the {{defender of the}} Patriarch of Alexandria. When he heard in 1441 {{of the destruction of}} the Egyptian monastery of Debre Mitmaq by Sultan Az-Zahir Sayf-ad-Din Jaqmaq, he called for a period of mourning, then sent a letter of strong protest to the Sultan. He reminded Jaqmaq that he had Muslim subjects whom he treated fairly, and warned that he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> divert the Nile, but refrained from doing so for the human suffering it would cause. Jaqmaq responded with gifts to appease Zara Yaqob's anger, but refused to rebuild the Coptic Churches he had destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Klein <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> make {{or break}} {{academic}} careers, so Born felt compelled to atone by submitting an entry for the prize. Because Klein refused to supervise him, Born arranged for Carl Runge to be his supervisor. Woldemar Voigt and Karl Schwarzschild became his other examiners. Starting from his paper, Born developed the equations for the stability conditions. As he became {{more interested in the}} topic, he had an apparatus constructed that could test his predictions experimentally. On 13 June 1906, the rector announced that Born had won the prize. A month later, he passed his oral examination and was awarded his PhD in mathematics magna cum laude.|$|E

5|$|Local magistrates had {{to appoint}} two {{inspectors}} known as visitors {{to ensure that}} factories and mills were complying with the Act; one {{was to be a}} clergyman and the other a Justice of the Peace, neither to have any connection with the mill or factory. The visitors <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> impose fines for non-compliance and the authority to visit at any time of the day to inspect the premises.|$|E
5|$|Most capable Soviet tank at Kursk was the T-34, the {{original}} version was armed with a 76.2mm gun, the gun struggled against uparmoured Panzer IVs, and the frontal armour of Tigers and Panthers was essentially impenetrable. Only SU-122 and the SU-152 <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> destroy the Tiger at short range, {{but they were not}} equal to the Tiger's 88mm gun at long range, and there were very few SU-122 and the SU-152 at Kursk.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus {{respected}} the Roman emperor's privilege of appointing provincial governors, and Zenobia continued this policy during her early reign. Although the queen did not interfere in day-to-day administration, she probably <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> command the governors {{in the organization}} of border security. During the rebellion, Zenobia maintained Roman forms of administration, but appointed the governors herself (most notably in Egypt, where Julius Marcellinus took office in 270 and was followed by Statilius Ammianus in 271).|$|E

5|$|On October 1, {{an apology}} letter from Blount was {{published}} in the Oregon school newspaper the Oregon Daily Emerald. Later that day, the Oregon Athletic Department released a statement indicating that a plan that could reinstate Blount to the team was under consideration. The next day, head coach Chip Kelly announced that if Blount meets certain guidelines, he could return for the November 7 game against the Stanford Cardinal. Pac-10 commissioner Larry Scott responded that the conference alone <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> reinstate Blount and would take Oregon's appeal under consideration if it occurred.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{enduring}} institutions of Augustus was {{the establishment of the}} Praetorian Guard in 27BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome. They <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was Maxentius, as it was Constantine I who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the Castra Praetoria.|$|E
5|$|That Chandler {{supported}} Robinson and {{the integration}} of baseball is evidenced by his actions during the 1947 season. First and foremost, as commissioner, Chandler <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> void Robinson's contract, but he chose to approve it. Further, following extreme, race-based jeering at Robinson by the Philadelphia Phillies and their manager, Ben Chapman, Chandler threatened both the team and Chapman personally with disciplinary action for any future incidents of race-based taunting. Later that season, he decisively supported Ford Frick's decision to indefinitely suspend any members of the St. Louis Cardinals who followed through on a threat to strike in protest of integration.|$|E

5|$|The Court found {{support for}} its {{position}} {{in the history of the}} unratified Titles of Nobility Amendment. The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment, rather than an ordinary act of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not believe that it <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents had argued that Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation.|$|E
5|$|The Sovereign has {{historically}} <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> choose Knights of the Order. From {{the eighteenth century}} onwards, the Sovereign made his or her choices upon {{the advice of the}} Government. George VI felt that the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle had been used only for political patronage, rather than to reward actual merit. Therefore, with the agreement of the Prime Minister (Clement Attlee) and the Leader of the Opposition (Winston Churchill) in 1946, both Orders returned to the personal gift of the Sovereign.|$|E
5|$|The new {{parliament}} passed {{a set of}} measures known as the Provisions of Oxford, which Henry swore to uphold. These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons, which then <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> appoint England's justiciar, chancellor and treasurer, and which would be monitored through triennial parliaments. Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform, intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King's officials and the major barons. More radical measures were passed by the new council the next year, {{in the form of}} the Provisions of Westminster.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{reasons for}} the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, {{he was no longer}} in an {{official}} position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a proconsul. When he annually held the office of consul, he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary. When he relinquished his annual consulship, he legally lost this power because his proconsular powers applied only to his imperial provinces. Augustus wanted to keep this power.|$|E
5|$|Tillman had met, in 1886, with Thomas G. Clemson, {{son-in-law}} of {{the late}} John C. Calhoun, to discuss a bequest to underwrite {{the cost of the}} new agricultural school. Clemson died in 1888, and his will not only left money and land for the college, but made Tillman one of seven trustees for life, who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> appoint their successors. Tillman stated that this provision, which made the lifetime trustees a majority of the board, was intended to forestall any attempt by a future Republican government to admit African Americans. Clemson College (later Clemson University) was authorized by the legislature in December 1888.|$|E
5|$|Vizzini {{offered to}} meet with Aldisio – who had been {{appointed}} High Commissioner in August 1944 – to solve the island’s grain problem, implying he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> do so. There {{is no evidence that}} Aldisio and Vizzini ever met to discuss the issue. Aldiso did, however, invite , a fellow Christian Democrat and Mafia member befriended by Vizzini, to secret gatherings with Christian Democrats. The meetings were seen as a first step in a government alliance with the Mafia. Aldisio’s appointment was perceived by Mafia chieftains as a first indication of the government’s determination to subdue the separatist movement. They were now forced to reconsider their support.|$|E
50|$|Most legislatures {{have their}} <b>powers</b> {{restricted}} by <b>the</b> nation's Constitution, and Montesquieu's theory of <b>the</b> separation of <b>powers</b> typically restricts a legislature's <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> legislation. Although <b>the</b> legislature <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> legislate, it is <b>the</b> courts who <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> interpret statutes, treaties and regulations. Similarly, although parliaments <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> legislate, {{it is usually}} the executive who decides on the legislative programme. The procedure is usually that a bill is introduced to Parliament, and after the required number of readings, committee stages and amendments, the bill gains approval and becomes an Act.|$|R
