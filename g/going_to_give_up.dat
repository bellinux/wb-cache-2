25|$|Iban Mayo, {{struggling}} the {{day before}} already, had trouble getting up the climbs from the first few meters yet again. He was also extremely annoyed by the cameraman following him and filming his struggle, as that camerman knew Mayo was probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> and {{was waiting for him}} to do so. In the end Mayo was fined for 200 Swiss Francs for incorrect behaviour in front of the camera. He abandoned when the cameraman stopped following him.|$|E
25|$|Texas Instruments v. Sprague: On April 10, 1962, Lehovec {{received}} a patent for isolation by p-n junction. Texas Instruments immediately filed {{a court case}} claiming that the isolation problem was solved in their earlier patent filed by Kilby. Robert Sprague, the founder of Sprague, considered the case hopeless and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the patent rights, was convinced otherwise by Lehovec. Four years later, Texas Instruments hosted in Dallas an arbitration hearing with demonstrations of the Kilby's inventions and depositions by experts. However, Lehovec conclusively proved that Kilby did not mention isolation of components. His priority on the isolation patent was finally acknowledged in April 1966.|$|E
500|$|I was hit [...] by flak as I {{was pulling}} out of a dive-strafing pass on an {{airfield}} called Tarnewitz, up on the Baltic. Five P-51s made a pass on the airdrome that April day. I {{was the only one}} to return home...When I tested the stall characteristics of my wounded bird over our home airfield, I found it quit flying at a little over [...] indicated and rolled violently into the dead wing (note: the right flap had been blown away and two large holes knocked in the same wing). What to do? Bailout seemed the logical response, but here's where sentiment {{got in the way of}} reason. That airplane (note: [...] "Scat VI") had taken me through a lot and I was damned if I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> on her...why the bird and I survived the careening, bouncing and juttering ride down the length of the field, I guess I'll never know.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{he shall}} have her. I {{made him a}} promise and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it <b>up.</b> I told {{him that if he}} was in earnest he should have her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> that <b>up,</b> he says." [...] He hadn't said this, but she {{was sure}} he would. [...] "His income is a hundred {{thousand}} dollars a year. Think of that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I am tougher than you, Percy, and shall {{take longer to}} kill, so I hope {{with all my heart}} that I may be right, and that they may be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> us <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the authorities." ...|$|R
500|$|Also, {{promptly}} {{after the}} war started, she attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals {{to the war effort}} but the French National Bank refused to accept them. [...] She did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize money. She said:I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the little gold I possess. [...] I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless to me. There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. This is the chief part of what we possess. I should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans. The state needs it. Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost. She was also an active member in committees of Polonia in France dedicated to the Polish cause. After the war, she summarized her wartime experiences in a book, Radiology in War (1919).|$|E
500|$|Director Jeunet {{wanted to}} display Ripley's new powers, {{including}} {{a scene in}} which Ripley throws a basketball through a hoop while facing the opposite direction. Weaver trained for ten days and averaged one out of six baskets, although the distance required for filming was farther than she had practiced. Jeunet was concerned about the time being spent on the shot and wanted to either use a machine to throw the ball or to insert it later using computer-generated imagery (CGI). Weaver, however, was determined to make the shot authentic, and insisted on doing it herself. The shot required many dozens of takes, during which none of the balls went in. The crew were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up,</b> but gave Weaver one last shot, and in this take, she got the ball in perfectly; the idea that she did it in one take is a myth. The ball was out of frame for a moment during the shot, and Pitof offered to edit it so that the ball was on-screen for the entire scene, but Weaver refused. Ron Perlman broke character when she made the basket, and turned to the camera to say [...] "Oh my god!" [...] There was enough of a pause between Weaver's basket and Perlman's statement for the film's editors to cut the scene accordingly during post-production.|$|E
2500|$|Burns and Paul were enraged, {{but after}} coming so close {{there was no}} chance that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> now. They resumed their protests at the White House on August 6, 1918. [...] Once again the women were jailed, exposed to horrendous conditions, and {{released}} shortly thereafter. [...] Their focus then was moved to helping pro-suffrage candidates get elected in November. [...] For the first time the NWP did not give allegiance to one party over another; they supported anyone who was willing to support suffrage, and this cost the Democrats their majority in Congress.|$|E
50|$|Back in England, Ramses and Nefret {{also seem}} {{targeted}} for abduction, and Ramses' harrowing letters {{do not add}} to Amelia's peace of mind. Meanwhile, Cyrus is beginning to look at Amelia with more affection than she expected, but she's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Emerson <b>up</b> without a fight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cousins or not, Alice," [...] Frank said, laughing, [...] "I have kissed {{you from}} the time you were a child, and if you suppose I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it <b>up</b> now, when there is a real {{pleasure}} in kissing you, you are mistaken, I can tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it <b>up</b> for a while, at least," [...] Dick had answered. During {{those days}} the search {{had been kept}} up for Josiah Crabtree, but so far nothing had been heard of the {{fugitive}} from justice. That the man had left the neighborhood was quite probable.|$|R
2500|$|In January 2009, on a {{broadcast}} of The 700 Club, Robertson {{stated that he}} is [...] "adamantly opposed" [...] to the division of Jerusalem between Israel and the Palestinians. He also stated that Armageddon is [...] "not going to be fought at Megiddo" [...] but will be the [...] "battle of Jerusalem," [...] when [...] "the forces of all nations come together and try to take Jerusalem away from the Jews. Jews are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> Jerusalem—they shouldn't—and {{the rest of the}} world is going to insist they give it up." [...] Robertson added that Jerusalem is a [...] "spiritual symbol that must not be given away" [...] because [...] "Jesus Christ the Messiah will come down to the part of Jerusalem that the Arabs want," [...] and that's [...] "not good." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October, Catalogue was {{published}} by Thames & Hudson, a 336-page hardcover book, written by Philip Hoare and Chris Heath, detailing their entire visual output (photography, {{as well as the}} design of albums, videos, tours, books and fan club magazines) from 1984 to 2004. Neil Tennant comments in the book: [...] "In the beginning we made a decision – and it was in our EMI contract – that that we would have control over how everything worked; that obviously the songs mattered hugely, but the way they were presented was going to matter hugely as well; and that we were never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> on that." [...] Pet Shop Boys supported the publication of the book with signings in London, New York City, Los Angeles and Berlin. To coincide with the publication of Catalogue, a small exhibition of portraits of Pet Shop Boys opened in the Bookshop Gallery of London's National Portrait Gallery, on 30 October 2006 and ran to 28 February 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Ungdomshuset {{soon began}} holding {{a number of}} {{meetings}} concerning {{the defense of the}} house, some of which were attended by up to a thousand people. The users began {{to make it clear that}} they were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the house without a fight. The consensus within the broad specter of supporters slowly, but surely started to change from non-violent protest to a felling that if violence was the only way to defend the house [...] "then so be it". This radical shift in the movement was caused by a number of things. First of all the conflict had turned into deadlock. The users of the house made a compromise offer to the city council, that if they would present the young people with a new house, they would peacefully leave Ungdomshuset. The only demand was that the new house was the same size as Ungdomshuset. The city council blankly refused that offer.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> {{my cousin}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> please Lady Albury--no, nor all the Fotheringhams put together! You {{used to say}} you did not care for gossip.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all I am only {{telling you}} a few plain facts. We {{have every reason to}} believe our boat is somewhere around this camp. If it is I {{want to know if you}} are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it <b>up</b> peaceably, or if we'll have to send down to town for an officer of the law? ...|$|R
6000|$|Anty, who {{had begun}} to feel quite happy in her new quarters, and among her kind friends, turned pale, and dropped her knife and fork. [...] "What'll I do, Mrs Kelly?" [...] she said, as she saw the old lady complacently get up. [...] "You're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me <b>up?</b> You'll not go to him?" ...|$|R
2500|$|A senior IDF officer {{told reporters}} on the {{outskirts}} of Jericho that [...] "We want to take them out alive, but if they threaten us, we won't hesitate to kill them. We won't agree to any change in Saadat's prison status". Some inmates took control of an armory in the prison. Israeli troops encircled the building while bulldozers knocked down nearby walls and helicopters fired missiles in an attempt to turn the prison into a [...] "pressure cooker". The Israelis called on all the Palestinians {{to come out of the}} compound. Many came out, including security officials and prisoners, who stripped to their underwear, as the Israelis had ordered. Saadat told Al Jazeera television in a telephone interview from the prison that [...] "Our choice is to fight or to die. We will not surrender", and that [...] "We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up,</b> we are going to face our destiny with courage". By nightfall, he ordered his men to put down their weapons and surrender. Shortly after 19:00, Chief of the Israeli Central Command, Major-General Yair Naveh, announced that the wanted men and several other militants in the jail had surrendered. The six, stripped to their underpants, surrendered and were questioned by security officials in the prison compound. The IDF also arrested sixty-seven other Palestinians who were still hiding inside the compound.|$|E

6000|$|... "My son," [...] {{retorted}} Blakeney, [...] "let me {{tell you}} this. You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> that message <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me and I will put five whole livres into your hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{accustomed}} {{to have my}} own way, Angela, and I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it <b>up</b> now. You must and you shall listen.

6000|$|... "That man {{has been}} here interfering. You don't {{mean to say that}} you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be put upon by such a savage as that, as has just come home from South Africa. Diamonds, indeed! I'd diamond him! I don't believe, not in a single diamond. They're all rubbish and paste.

6000|$|... "But then I was disappointed. I {{was too far}} to the left. I {{could only}} see {{sideways}} into the room. A bit of curtain, and a yard of wallpaper was all I could command. Well, that wasn't any manner of good to me, but just as I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it <b>up,</b> and climb down ignominiously, some one inside moved and threw his shadow on my little bit of wall--and, by gum, it was Whittington! ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{growing up}} {{he worked hard}} <b>to</b> keep himself <b>going</b> and not <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> his passion.

60|$|He {{had made}} up his mind to tell her that he was {{reconciled}} with her father. In future bygones must be bygones. He would no longer live alone, or practically alone, in this great house; he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it <b>up,</b> and take one in the country for his son, where they could all go and live together. If June did not like this, she could have an allowance and live by herself. It wouldn't make much difference to her, for {{it was a long time}} since she had shown him any affection.|$|R

6000|$|He {{drew in a}} long breath, and set {{his teeth}} hard upon his lip. [...] "You may depend upon its hurting," [...] he said, [...] "but I was glad to risk the pain, {{whatever}} it was, for the chance of getting you to reconsider. I presume I'm not the conventional wooer. I'm too old for it, and I'm too blunt and plain a man. I've been thirty-five years making {{up my mind to}} ask you to marry me.

50|$|I {{lost touch}} {{with a lot of}} people, and then I called Rodney and he wasn’t doing too good. It was a wake-up call. At that moment I felt like I was a pathetic piece of trash.
