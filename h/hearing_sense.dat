50|$|The Gobi jerboa {{is similar}} to Allactaga siberica in color. Its fur is light, and the {{entirety}} of its back, {{as well as the}} outer sides of its thigh, is grayish buff. The underside of the Gobi jerboa, as well as the forearms, hind limbs, and upper lip are pure white to the roots of the hair. Additionally, a prominent hip strip adorns the outside of the hind end of the thigh. This strip is slightly more reddish in color than the Allactaga balikuncia (Smith and Xie 2008). The tail is covered with well-developed tufted hairs, and while the base of the underside of the tail consists of white tufts, the inner surface is composed of a black portion with a white median longitudinal strip, and the tip of the tail is pure white (Smith and Xie 2008). The Gobi jerboa's tail helps to accelerate its bipedal gallop (Evans and Hutchins). The auditory bullae are very large in size, and almost meet {{at the front of the}} skull (Smith and Xie 2008). The dental formula of the Gobi jerboa is I 1/1 C 0/0 P 1/1 M 2/2 (R. Taylor). One of the most prominent features of the Gobi jerboa are their ears, since they are almost three times as large as their heads. Their large ears give them an extra keen <b>hearing</b> <b>sense,</b> which helps to serve as extra protection in their vulnerable environment. The great size of their ears also helps to cool their bodies by dissipating heat, since they reside in deserts which can get extremely hot during the day (Wild Tracks).|$|E

40|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>sense</b> {{is one of}} the key {{elements}} which may have impact on the driver′s task quality. This cross-sectional study investigates the hearing status of 500 truck drivers by pure tone audiometry (AC) in one of the cities in Fars province, Iran. Hearing threshold levels of the subjects were measured in frequencies of 500 Hz- 8000 Hz. Screening and determination of permanent threshold shift (PTS) was the first aim of this study. Hence tests were done at least 16 hours after any exposure to noticeable sound. The effect of age as a confounding factor was considered using ISO equation and subtracted from whole hearing threshold. The threshold of 25 dB HL and above was considered abnormal but the calculation of hearing was also carried out using 0 dB HL as reference. Subjects were categorized into two groups on the basis of working experience and the hearing threshold of 25 dB was considered a boundary of normal <b>hearing</b> <b>sense.</b> The results of Pearson Chi-Square test showed that working experience as an independent variable has significant contributing effect on hearing thresholds of truck drivers in frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz (p greater than 0. 05). Also, it was shown that currently nine and 12. 6 % of truck drivers suffer from impaired <b>hearing</b> <b>sense</b> in left and right respectively (hearing threshold level greater than 25 dB) in mid frequencies (500, 1000, 2000 Hz) and 45 % in high frequencies of both ears (4000 and 8000 Hz). The results indicated that hearing damage of professional drivers was expected to occur sooner at 4000 and 8000 Hz than lower frequencies. Finally it was deduced that the occupational conditions of truck drivers may have bilateral, symmetrical harmful effect on hearing threshold sense in all frequencies mainly in frequency of 4000 Hz, so health surveillance programs such as education and periodic medical examinations are emphasized for pre-diagnosing and prevention of any possible impairment and an urgent need to take up some interventions such as better maintenance of roads, automobile industry efforts to reduce the noise level emission of vehicles and reducing number of working hours per day of drivers are highlighted to improve the harmful working conditions of truck drivers...|$|E

We then elaborate upon the role that (algorithmic) information theory may play here, and whether cognitive interaction can be recognised and assessed with this theory.

In this paper we present a robust sound source localization method in three-dimensional space using an array of 8 microphones. The method is based on time delay of arrival estimation.

By using models of both free field wave propagation and head related transfer functions (HRTF), these cues are combined to form estimates of spatial parameters such as the directions of arrival (DOA).

40|$|Abstract. Human {{capabilities}} of recognizing {{different type of}} music and grouping them into categories of genre are so remarkable that experts in music can perform such classification using their <b>hearing</b> <b>senses</b> and logical judgment. For decades now, the scientific community were involved in research to automate the human process of recognizing genre of songs. These efforts would normally imitate the human method of recognizing the music by considering every essential component of the songs from artist voice, melody of the music through {{to the type of}} instruments used. As a result, various approaches or mechanisms are introduced and developed to automate the classification process. The results of these studies so far have been remarkable yet can still be improved. The aim of this research is to investigate Artificial Immune System (AIS) domain by focusing on the modified AIS-based classifier to solve this problem where the focuses are the censoring and monitoring modules. In this highlight, stages of music recognition are emphasized where feature extraction, feature selection, and feature classification processes are explained.
