5|$|Over {{the next}} two hundred years, the Great Glen was raided {{frequently}} by the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, powerful rulers of a semi-independent kingdom in western Scotland, with a claim to the earldom of Ross. In 1395, Domhnall of Islay seized Urquhart Castle from the crown, and managed to retain <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 15 years. In 1411, he marched through the glen {{to take on the}} king's supporters at the Battle of Harlaw. Although an indecisive battle, Domhnall subsequently lost the initiative and the crown was soon back in control of Urquhart. In 1437 Domhnall's son Alexander, now Earl of Ross, raided around Glen Urquhart but could not take the castle. Royal funds were granted to shore up the castle's defences. Alexander's son John succeeded his father in 1449, aged 16. In 1452 he too led a raid up the Great Glen, seizing Urquhart, and subsequently obtained a grant of the lands and castle of Urquhart for life. However, in 1462 John made an agreement with Edward IV of England against the Scottish King James III. When this became known to James in 1476, John was stripped of his titles, and Urquhart was turned over to an ally, the Earl of Huntly.|$|E

On June 2, 1939, an oil tanker struck it, and the east tower and lift span {{collapsed}} into the river, injuring two bridge employees, and closing <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 6 months. Another major collision of a ship occurred on June 13, 1943. The most recent collision with a ship was in January, 2004.|$|E

Doxycycline is available as a generic medicine and is generally inexpensive. The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 0.01 and 0.04 USD per pill.

25|$|Construction {{was delayed}} {{for more than}} a year by {{litigation}} over several issues, including taxes. A court ruled that the city-owned marina no longer qualified for tax exemptions under the Murphy lease. Not contesting the decision, Murphy said she would proceed with construction. However, soon after that announcement, Murphy’s Fort Lauderdale Candlelight Corporation sold all its shares to an investment group headed by Maryland developer Albert W. Turner, which took over the lease to the marina and built the Bahia Mar Hotel. The restaurant continued to operate as Patricia Murphy’s Candlelight Restaurant, and Murphy remained associated with <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a decade, also leasing a gift shop from the new marina owners.|$|E
25|$|The inn {{was forced}} to move with the {{expansion}} of U.S. Route 202. U.S. 202 is a major north-south highway that passes through the town from southwest to northeast. Its construction as a modern expressway would have caused {{the destruction of the}} King of Prussia Inn; however, historic preservationists managed to prevail upon the state of Pennsylvania to avoid this important structure by building north and southbound lanes on either side of <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a quarter century the inn was marooned on a median island, with motor traffic whizzing past on both sides. It was sealed up for years, surrounded by a high fence. The inn was successfully relocated in 2000 and opened to the public in October 2002.|$|E
25|$|The {{historic}} {{significance of}} the home is in its association with Ruben M. Benjamin, who lived in <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 60 years, until he died in 1917. Benjamin was raised in Chatham Center, Columbia County, New York. He first graduated from Kinderhook Academy and then Amherst College and eventually attended Harvard law school for a year. He ended up in Bloomington in 1856. When Benjamin passed the bar exam in 1856, Abraham Lincoln served as his examiner. After passing the bar, Benjamin married and practiced law with various Bloomington lawyers, such as Asahel Gridley and Thomas F. Tipton. In 1869, Benjamin {{was elected to the}} Illinois state constitutional convention, where he distinguished himself as a leader. During the convention Benjamin strongly advocated language allowing the regulation of the freight industry. The clauses he supported were included in Article XI of the Illinois Constitution.|$|E

25|$|During {{the initial}} stages of the {{fighting}} on Crete, the Australians defending Heraklion managed to defeat the attack there and blunt the attack at Retimo, holding <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a week; however, at Maleme the Germans managed to wrest control of a vital airfield, and as a result began flying in reinforcements of airborne and mountain troops. As the Germans began moving inland to outflank the defenders' positions, the Australian, New Zealand and British forces were forced back towards Chania, which came under heavy air attack by German bombers. By 27 May, the weakened Australian 2/7th and 2/8th Battalions, supported by the New Zealand 21st, 28th, 19th, 22nd and 23rd Battalions, had taken up positions along 42nd Street, south-east of Chania where they formed a rearguard to protect the rest of the Commonwealth forces that were being pushed south. The Anzac units were manned at less than 50 percent of their normal strength, having suffered heavy casualties earlier in the fighting.|$|E
25|$|Woodpeckers {{use their}} chisel-like bills to {{excavate}} their cavity nests, {{a process which}} takes, on average, about two weeks. Cavities are normally excavated on the downward-facing side of a branch, presumably {{to make it more}} difficult for predators to access the nest, and to reduce the chance that rain floods the nest. There is also some evidence that fungal rot may make the wood on the underside of leaning trunks and branches easier to excavate. Most woodpeckers use a cavity for only a single year. The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker is an exception; it takes far longer—up to two years—to excavate its nest cavity, and may reuse <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two decades. The typical woodpecker nest has a short horizontal tunnel which leads to a vertical chamber within the trunk. The size and shape of the chamber depends on species, and the entrance hole is typically only as large as is needed to allow access for the adult birds. While wood chips are removed during the excavation process, most species line the floor of the cavity with a fresh bed of them before laying their eggs.|$|E

500|$|A charter {{granted in}} about 1260 {{shows that a}} corn-grinding mill was {{operating}} in Didsbury, along the River Mersey, but the earliest reference to Didsbury is in a document dating from 1235, recording a grant of land for {{the building of a}} chapel. The church was named St James Church in 1855. It underwent major refurbishment in 1620 and again in the 19th century, although most of the stonework visible today dates from the 17th century. A parsonage [...] was built next to one of the two public houses that flanked the nearby village green, Ye Olde Cock Inn, so-called because of the cockfighting that used to take place there. The parsonage soon gained a reputation for being haunted; servants refused to sleep on the premises, and it was abandoned in 1850. Local alderman Fletcher Moss bought the house in 1865, and lived in <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 40years. In 1902, he installed wrought iron gates {{at the entrance to the}} parsonage's garden, which, because of the building's reputation, became known locally as [...] "the gates to Hell". The parsonage became a museum, now closed, but the gardens are still open to the public. The area around St James' Church has the highest concentration of listed buildings in Manchester, outside the city centre.|$|E

Nearby ships registered the initial explosion and a second, much larger, explosion two minutes and fifteen seconds later, which was powerful enough to register on seismographs as far away as Alaska. The Russian Navy did not realise that the sub had sunk and did not halt the exercise or initiate a search for <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> six hours.

2500|$|The missing {{leaves are}} {{a subject of}} fierce controversy. The Jews of Aleppo claim that they were burned.

Two [...] "missing" [...] leaves have turned up, one in 1982 {{and the other in}} 2007, leaving open the possibility that even more may have survived the riots in 1947. [...] In particular, the 2012 book, The Aleppo Codex [...] by Matti Friedman, calls {{attention to the fact that}} eyewitnesses in Aleppo who saw the Codex shortly after the fire consistently reported that it was complete or nearly complete, and then there is no account of <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a decade, until after it arrived in Israel and was put in the Ben-Zvi Institute, at which point it was as currently described; his book suggests a number of possibilities for the loss of the pages.|$|E
