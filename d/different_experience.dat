5|$|Peers help expose {{children}} to multi-party conversations. This allows {{children to}} hear {{a greater variety of}} speech, and to observe different conversational roles. Peers may be uncooperative conversation partners, which pressures the children to communicate more effectively. Speaking to peers is different from speaking to adults, but children may still correct their peers. Peer interaction provides children with a <b>different</b> <b>experience</b> filled with special humour, disagreements and conversational topics.|$|E

They have also used songs after a certain period of time: an example is 'King Park', which although was initially considered too emotionally draining for live performances, the band eventually started to play the song live. The band played 'St Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' from Wildlife at its first performance in September 2012.|$|E

5|$|Bradman then {{returned}} {{in the next}} match against Surrey at The Oval in London, winning the toss and electing to bat. The last time Australia had played at the ground was the Fifth Test in 1938, when England declared at a world record score of 7/903; Bradman had hurt his ankle, {{and was unable to}} bat as Australia fell to the largest defeat in Test history. This match was a far <b>different</b> <b>experience</b> for the Australians. Barnes and Morris put on 136 before Bradman came in to join Barnes; together they added another 207 before Barnes fell for 176. Bradman started slowly and was heckled by the crowd for taking 80 minutes to reach 50, but accelerated and went on to score 146 before being dismissed at 3/403, with Australia proceeding to be all out for 632. He had attacked the medium pacers with his pull shot, but had some difficulties reading the left arm wrist spin of Australian expatriate John McMahon, nearly being caught behind the wicket on multiple occasions. Australia then bowled Surrey out for 141 and 195 to win by an innings.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, it was {{announced}} that VyRT would exclusively broadcast worldwide the performance scheduled on September 15 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. Sales for digital tickets began on September 3. VyRT provided access to several <b>different</b> <b>experience</b> packages featuring backstage interactivity with both bands and exclusive content. On September 15, before Thirty Seconds to Mars took to the stage, the VyRT platform was hacked and was a victim of a piracy. Jared Leto, founder of the streaming service, was forced to delay the performance by Thirty Seconds to Mars by an hour to resolve the issue. The audience eventually lost approximately three minutes of actual stage time, but the set list was shortened. The event included real-time social community engagement from audiences worldwide. A second broadcast of the show was later scheduled for September 17, 2014. The performance by Thirty Seconds to Mars became commercially available for download in October 2014 through VyRT. Footage recorded during the Carnivores Tour was uploaded to Linkin Park's official YouTube account.|$|E
5|$|Sierra {{wanted the}} game to have Hollywood-quality film sequences, so they sought a {{director}} with experience in the film industry. They hired Peter Maris, whose previous experience was mainly of action and drama films, although some of his earlier films were graphic horror movies. Maris and Roberta Williams collaborated {{a great deal from}} the beginning of the process, with Maris explaining what he wanted in each scene from a filmmaker's perspective, and Williams explaining her desires from a game designer's perspective. Maris set up the camera angles and worked with the actors, using three motion-controlled cameras during the shooting. All filming was done entirely in front of a blue screen, and the digitized information was later loaded into the Silicon Graphics computers, which synchronized the relative motion of computer-generated, three-dimensional background art. Next, the live action and the backgrounds were composited using advanced techniques controlled by Petro VLahos's UltiMatte system. The computer imaging components made Phantasmagoria a very <b>different</b> <b>experience</b> for Maris than his usual film industry work. Crow served as a production coordinator during filming, helping facilitate what happened on stage. He also directed the scenes that involved stunts or other special effects that required the coordination of animated sequences with live action. Cindy Jordan worked as the makeup artist.|$|E

All the illustrations were restored for the 1994 worldwide HarperCollins edition, although these lacked the clarity of early printings.|$|E

Each of these nine stories circles around a <b>different</b> <b>experience</b> of grief {{following the death of}} a loved one.

25|$|Gender {{roles and}} {{stereotypes}} in society {{are reflected in}} a <b>different</b> <b>experience</b> {{for male and female}} models, and different responses when those not in the arts learn that someone is a nude model. However, both male and female models tend to keep their modeling career distinct from their other social interactions, if for different reasons. Attitudes toward male nudity, issues of homosexuality when male artists work from male models, and some bias towards the female form in art may lead to less opportunity for male models, and works of art that include male nudity are much less marketable. However, historically this has not been the case (See below).|$|E
25|$|Since the {{original}} Makaitoushi SaGa, {{much of the}} series has relied on loosely connected stories and sidequests rather than an epic narrative. Makaitoushi SaGa allowed players to travel through different worlds. Romancing SaGa expanded the open-endedness by offering many choices and allowing players to complete quests in any order, with the decision {{of whether or not}} to participate in any particular quest affecting the outcome of the storyline. The game also allowed players to choose from eight different characters, each with their own stories that start in different places and offer different outcomes. Romancing SaGa thus succeeded in providing a very <b>different</b> <b>experience</b> during each run through the game, something that later non-linear RPGs such as SaGa Frontier and Fable had promised but were unable to live up to. It also introduced a combo system where up to five party members can perform a combined special attack, and required characters to pay mentors to teach them abilities, whether it is using certain weapons or certain proficiencies like opening a chest or dismantling a trap.|$|E
25|$|Hearthstone is a digital-only {{collectible}} {{card game}} that revolves around turn-based matches between two opponents (player vs. player or player vs. computer opponent) using pre-made decks of cards from their collection. In matches, players use their card deck, representing summonable minions, spells, and other actions, {{along with their}} selected Hero's unique power, to try to defeat their opponent by reducing their health to zero before the opponent {{can do the same}} to them. Players can choose from a number of game modes, with each offering a slightly <b>different</b> <b>experience.</b> Players start the free-to-play game with a limited collection of basic cards but can gain rarer and more powerful cards through purchasing packs of cards through micropayments or as rewards from specific game modes. Blizzard has added new cards sets through Expansions and Adventures, roughly three times a year, to increase the pool of available cards. To help newer players remain competitive with experienced ones while also keeping the metagame dynamic, Blizzard has implemented two different styles of gameplay; Standard which uses only the basic set of cards plus those of the most recent expansions, and Wild, which allows any cards to be used.|$|E

25|$|Families tend to {{seek out}} schools whose {{principal}} languages they share, and ideally one which mirrors their own educational system. Many countries have American schools, French schools, British schools, German Schools and 'International Schools' which often follow {{one of the three}} International Baccalaureate programs. These will be populated by expatriates' children and some children of the local upper middle class. They do this in an effort to maintain linguistic stability and to ensure that their children do not fall behind due to linguistic problems. Where their own language is not available, families will often choose English-speaking schools for their children. They do this because of the linguistic and cultural opportunities being immersed in English might provide their children when they are adults, and because their children {{are more likely to have}} prior exposure to English than to other international languages. This poses the potential for non-English speaking TCKs to have a significantly <b>different</b> <b>experience</b> from TCKs for whom English is a native language. Research on TCKs from Japan, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the United States and Africa has shown that TCKs from different countries share more in common with other TCKs than they do with their own peer group from their passport country.|$|E

500|$|While Origins is a single-player-only game, Muzyka {{described}} it as a [...] "social experience", considering the narrative and its variety of paths {{as an integral part of}} the gameplay. The characters a player meets, items they collect, and quests they receive and complete may be different, leading to a completely <b>different</b> <b>experience.</b> He also considered the ways a player explores the world and discovers new areas as an exploration narrative. As each player had <b>different</b> <b>experience,</b> they hoped that those players would collaborate to expand upon their knowledge of the world. To that effect, the team built a community site as an online social environment for players to communicate. Players could share stats and automatically generated screenshots with the community.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{missions}} {{were designed}} to suit the story, rather than the story to fit the missions. Taking inspiration from GoldenEye 007, the team added a difficulty system that changes mission objectives; Leonard said [...] "it allowed the designers to create a very <b>different</b> <b>experience</b> at each level of difficulty, without changing the overall geometry and structure of a mission. This gave the game {{a high degree of}} replayability at a minimum development cost". The team extended the concept by decreasing the player's ability to kill human characters on higher difficulty settings. Writer and voice actress Terri Brosius said: [...] "We took pains to make sure all the missions could be won without killing any humans".|$|E
