5|$|Xenotransplantation {{research}} involves transplanting tissues or organs {{from one}} species to another, {{as a way}} to overcome the shortage of <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> for use in organ transplants. Current research involves using primates as the recipients of organs from pigs that have been genetically modified to reduce the primates' immune response against the pig tissue. Although transplant rejection remains a problem, recent clinical trials that involved implanting pig insulin-secreting cells into diabetics did reduce these people's need for insulin.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} what <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> are {{affected}} by interaction with promethium; a possible candidate is the bone tissues. Sealed promethium-147 is not dangerous. However, if the packaging is damaged, then promethium becomes dangerous {{to the environment and}} humans. If radioactive contamination is found, the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap, but, even though promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a promethium leak is found, the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted. No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{was first}} {{detected}} in <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> and fetal tissues {{in the late}} 19th century. In humans there are no defined lithium deficiency diseases, but low lithium intakes from water supplies were associated with increased rates of suicides, homicides and the arrest rates for drug use and other crimes. The biochemical mechanisms of action of lithium appear to be multifactorial and are intercorrelated with the functions of several enzymes, hormones and vitamins, {{as well as with}} growth and transforming factors. Evidence now appears to be sufficient to accept lithium as essential; a provisional RDA of 1,000µg/day is suggested for a 70kg adult.|$|E

It is focused on the assessment of existing legislation regarding transplantation, the identification of problematical areas of transplantation law and the possibility of their correction. The thesis is divided into several parts. At the beginning it deals with the history and development of transplant medicine. It also contains a description of the current legislation and a brief summary of an international regulation. The main focus of the thesis is to analyze the deficiencies in Czech legislation and to emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of the transplant law. Finally, it analyzes the forthcoming amendment to The <b>Human</b> <b>Organ</b> Transplantation Act prepared by the Ministry of Health. The <b>Human</b> <b>Organ</b> Transplantation Act is a modern legislation respecting international commitments of the Czech Republic.

25|$|David Kilgour and David Matas {{say that}} the Chinese government’s {{response}} to their investigation in 2006 contained “a good deal of invective, but no factual information which contradicts or undermines our conclusions or analysis.” In particular, the Chinese government response centered on the charge that Falun Gong is an “evil cult”; questioned the motives and independence of the researchers; and noted a captioning error where their report had mislabeled the location of two Chinese cities. The government’s response also stated that China prohibits the sale of <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> and requires written consent of the donor—claims which Kilgour and Matas say are belied by the evidence.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the absence}} of an {{organized}} system of organ donation or allocation, wait times for obtaining vital organs in China are among the shortest in the world—often just weeks for organs such as kidneys, livers, and hearts. This has made it a destination for international transplant tourism and a major venue for tests of pharmaceutical anti-rejection drugs. The commercial trade in <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> has also been a lucrative source of revenue for the Chinese medical, military and public security establishments. Because there is no effective nationwide organ donation or allocation system, hospitals source organs from local brokers, including through their connections to courts, detention centers and prisons.|$|E

The motion, which was introduced one day after a parliamentary briefing on the subject of organ harvesting from Falun Gong prisoners, called on Australia to adopt strict standards to address the practice of international organ trafficking.

40|$|Abstract: An augmented-reality {{approach}} to real-time visualization of tactile data with projection on a <b>human</b> <b>organ</b> is presented. A target procedure is breast cancer examination with a tactile sensor. The special tactile sensor {{is used to}} measure tissue stiffness values at discrete points of the examined organ. We developed an augmented reality system which integrates the tactile sensor, a head-mounted display with a small video camera, and a notebook computer. Tracking of the <b>human</b> <b>organ</b> and the tactile sensor is based on optical markers. One marker {{is attached to the}} patient’s body and is used to track the spatial position of the <b>human</b> <b>organ.</b> Another marker is placed on the tactile sensor. Registering space positions of this marker with respect to the first marker allows determination of the shape of the <b>human</b> <b>organ</b> for subsequent data visualization. Results of stiffness measurements are depicted as semi-transparent three-dimensional objects projected on the patient’s body. Different visualization techniques are employed depending on the amount of data and user preference. Experiments with sensing tactile data and its visualization for a variety of objects, including a silicon breast model and animals organs, have been performed. It was found that the developed augmented-reality system is useful in medical-physics measurements. ...|$|R
