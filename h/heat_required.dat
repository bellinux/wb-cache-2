Reducing the freezing point of water with ammonia would also allow for outgassing and higher gas pressure, and less <b>heat</b> <b>required</b> to power the water plumes. The subsurface layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia–water slurry at temperatures as low as , and thus less energy is required to produce the plume activity.|$|E
25|$|Design of an {{industrial}} heating system starts with {{assessment of the}} temperature required, the amount of <b>heat</b> <b>required,</b> and the feasible modes of transferring heat energy.

25|$|If heat {{capacity}} is measured for a well defined amount of substance, the specific heat {{is the measure}} of the <b>heat</b> <b>required</b> to increase the temperature of such a unit quantity by one unit of temperature.

25|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry, or DSC, is a thermoanalytical {{technique in}} which {{the difference in the}} amount of <b>heat</b> <b>required</b> to increase the temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally, the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The reference sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the range of temperatures to be scanned.|$|E
25|$|In {{most high}} power Stirling engines, both the minimum {{pressure}} and mean {{pressure of the}} working fluid are above atmospheric pressure. This initial engine pressurization can be realized by a pump, or by filling the engine from a compressed gas tank, or even just by sealing the engine when the mean temperature {{is lower than the}} mean operating temperature. All of these methods increase the mass of working fluid in the thermodynamic cycle. All of the heat exchangers must be sized appropriately to supply the necessary heat transfer rates. If the heat exchangers are well designed and can supply the heat flux needed for convective heat transfer, then the engine, in a first approximation, produces power in proportion to the mean pressure, as predicted by the West number, and Beale number. In practice, the maximum pressure is also limited to the safe pressure of the pressure vessel. Like most aspects of Stirling engine design, optimization is multivariate, and often has conflicting requirements. A difficulty of pressurization is that while it improves the power, the <b>heat</b> <b>required</b> increases proportionately to the increased power. This heat transfer is made increasingly difficult with pressurization since increased pressure also demands increased thicknesses of the walls of the engine, which, in turn, increase the resistance to heat transfer.|$|E

[...] To provide the <b>heat</b> <b>required</b> for the vaporization involved in distillation and also to compensate for heat loss, heat is most often added {{to the bottom of the}} column by a reboiler, and the purity of the top product can be improved by recycling some of the externally condensed top product liquid as reflux.

This is called 'oxidation', but the more specific and more commonly used term {{in this context is}} 'combustion'. In the case of hydrogen, the product of combustion is simply water. For the other hydrocarbon fuels, water and carbon dioxide are produced. The heat is released because the molecules of the products of combustion have a lower energy state than the molecules of the fuel and oxygen.

Reputable companies often provide for repeat treatments if heat causes damage to the filling. The <b>heat</b> <b>required</b> to cause damage is that of a blowtorch used to work on settings, and it is essential to inform anyone working on a setting if the diamond is fracture-filled, so they can apply cooling agents to the diamond and use greater care while working on it.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{adjacent}} diagram, water pumped {{from the tower}} basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and condensers in an industrial facility. [...] The cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed, and the absorbed heat warms the circulating water (C). The warm water returns {{to the top of}} the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower. [...] As it trickles down, it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural draft or by forced draft using large fans in the tower. That contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage/drift (W) and some of the water (E) to evaporate. The <b>heat</b> <b>required</b> to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself, which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready to recirculate. The evaporated water leaves its dissolved salts behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated, thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water. To prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high, a portion of the water is drawn off/blown down (D) for disposal. Fresh water make-up (M) is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water, the windage loss water and the draw-off water.|$|E

System parameters examined include the ampoule, melt and crystal thermal conductivities, the magnitude and width of localized heating, and the latent heat of crystallization. Concave interface shapes, typical of semiconductor systems, could be flattened or made convex with localized heating. Although localized heating caused shallower thermal gradients ahead of the interface, {{the magnitude of the}} localized <b>heating</b> <b>required</b> for convexity was less than that which resulted in a thermal inversion ahead of the interface.

60|$|The {{doctrine}} of specific heat {{originated in the}} eighteenth century. It means that the same mass of a body, under the same circumstances, always requires the same quantity of heat to raise it to a given temperature, but that equal masses of different bodies require different quantities. Ultimately, {{it was found that}} the quantities of <b>heat</b> <b>required</b> to raise equal masses of the more perfect gases, through equal ranges of temperature, were inversely proportional to their combining weights. Thus a definite relation was established between the hypothetical units and heat. The phenomena of electrolytic decomposition showed that there was a like close relation between these units and electricity. The quantity of electricity generated by the combination of any two units is sufficient to separate any other two which are susceptible of such decomposition. The phenomena of isomorphism showed a relation between the units and crystalline forms; certain units are thus able to replace others in a crystalline body without altering its form, and others are not.|$|E
