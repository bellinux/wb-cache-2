40|$|Conference Name:International Conference on Manufacturing Engineering and Automation. Conference Address: Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA. Time:DEC 07 - 09, 2010. On {{the basis}} of {{analyzing}} the geometric characteristics of the <b>helical</b> <b>groove,</b> the interferometry method for its processing is discussed. This paper establishes a mathematical model of the <b>helical</b> <b>groove,</b> using differential geometry theory and numerical analysis. This research analyzes the impact of machine adjustment parameters (i. e. setting angle) on the geometry specification (i. e. Rake angle) of the <b>helical</b> <b>groove.</b> The simulation examples are done by CAD (Computer Aided Design), and the reasonable adjustment of machine parameters will be obtained by computer simulation and statistical analysis. This will reduce the time for design, the number of trial samples, and production costs. This study provides a precise 3 D helical cutter model {{which can be used}} in areas such as finite element analysis (FEA) and virtual cutting tests...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A purely {{analytical}} method, {{based on}} the meshing theory, is presented to establish the exact <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> and circumferential cutting edge model of end mills, for the solution of its low design precision and efficiency problems. Firstly, a coordinate system to represent the relative space position relations between grinding wheels and end mills is built and the mathematical model of the <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> is precisely calculated with a given wheel profile and relative movements between the wheel and the workpiece. Then, the rake angle, inner radius and wheel positions of machining the clearance faces is computed. Finally, a 3 D model of the end mill is generated by using OpenGL...|$|R

5000|$|Flutes / teeth: The flutes of {{the milling}} bit are the deep <b>helical</b> <b>grooves</b> {{running up the}} cutter, while the sharp blade {{along the edge of}} the flute is known as the tooth. The tooth cuts the {{material}}, and chips of this material are pulled up the flute by the rotation of the cutter. There is almost always one tooth per flute, but some cutters have two teeth per flute. Often, the words flute and tooth are used interchangeably. Milling cutters may have from one to many teeth, with 2, 3 and 4 being most common. Typically, the more teeth a cutter has, the more rapidly it can remove material. So, a 4-tooth cutter can remove material at twice the rate of a 2-tooth cutter.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{parallel}} guide rods that run between upper left and lower {{right in the}} photo carry the [...] "sled", the moving optical read-write head. As shown, this [...] "sled" [...] is close to, or at the position where it reads or writes {{at the edge of}} the disc. To move the [...] "sled" [...] during continuous read or write operations, a stepper motor rotates a leadscrew to move the [...] "sled" [...] throughout its total travel range. The motor, itself, is the short gray cylinder just to the left of the most-distant shock mount; its shaft is parallel to the support rods.

50|$|Some older starter designs, {{such as the}} Bendix drive, {{used the}} {{rotational}} inertia of the pinion to force it along a <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> cut into the starter drive-shaft, and thus no mechanical linkage with the solenoid was required.|$|R
40|$|<b>Helical</b> <b>groove</b> seal is {{designed}} in reactor coolant pump {{to control the}} leakage along the front surface of the impeller face due to its higher resistance than the circumferentially grooved seal. The flow and the friction factors in <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> seals are predicted by employing a commercial CFD code, FLUENT. The friction factors of the <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> seals with helix angles varying from 20 [*]deg to 50 [*]deg, at a range of rotational speed and axial Reynolds number, were, respectively, calculated. For the helically grooved stator with the helix angle greater than 20 [*]deg, the leakage shows an upward trend with the helix angle. The circumferentially grooved stator has a lower resistance to leakage than the 20 [*]deg and 30 [*]deg stators. It can be predicated that, for a bigger helix angle, the friction factor increases slightly {{with an increase in}} high axial Reynolds number, which arises from the high-pressure operation condition, and the friction factor is generally sensitive to changes in the helix angle in this operation condition. The study lays the theoretical foundation for liquid seal design of reactor coolant pump and future experimental study to account for the high-pressure condition affecting the leakage characteristic...|$|R
30|$|In summary, current {{studies on}} the {{finishing}} of a free-abrasive have mainly focused on improving the surface quality without involving the surface modification. In addition, current {{studies on the}} polishing of free-abrasives mainly focused on the movement and control of a single abrasive grain, and research into the different parts has been lacking. The shape and structure of a spiral groove restrict its use as a polishing tool. Therefore, the free-abrasive grain of tool-less finishing is {{an effective way to}} improve the surface quality and accuracy of the shape of a non–machined spiral groove. In this paper, the spiral groove of a revolving body is taken as the research object. A method used to make a helical movement of a workpiece, and cut and polish an abrasive grain, is proposed. The principle of the relative motion of the abrasive ball trajectory is studied. The trajectory and design helix are in concordance with a mathematical model. The grooved drum parts were polished and tested to verify that not only can the error {{in the shape of the}} <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> be corrected but the surface roughness of the <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> can also be reduced, and the <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> of the rotating body can be repaired and polished, providing a theoretical basis for free-abrasive tool polishing without a modification.|$|R
50|$|The Mondragón Modelo 1908 was a gas-operated rifle with a {{rotating}} bolt, and a cylinder and piston arrangement. This design is now common, but was unusual at the time. The bolt was locked by lugs in <b>helical</b> <b>grooves</b> in the receiver. There was a switch, {{located on the}} charging handle, which would disengage the bolt from the gas system, changing the firearm into a straight-pull, bolt action, rifle. The rifle had a non-detachable box magazine and was filled by two, five-round stripper clips. The Mondragón Modelo 1908 rifles were fitted with a bipod. In addition to the knife bayonet introduced with the previous rifles, Mondragón designed a spade bayonet for use with the Modelo 1908, for which he filed a patent application (No. 631,283) on June 6, 1911.|$|E
5000|$|Gradually, rifles {{appeared}} with cylindrical barrels cut with <b>helical</b> <b>grooves,</b> the surfaces between the grooves being [...] "lands". The innovation shortly preceded the mass adoption of breech-loading weapons, {{as it was}} not practical to push an overbore bullet down through a rifled barrel, only to then (try to) fire it back out. The dirt and grime from prior shots was pushed down ahead of a tight bullet or ball (which {{may have been a}} loose fit in the clean barrel before the first shot), and, of course, loading was far more difficult, as the lead had to be deformed to go down in the first place, reducing the accuracy due to deformation. Several systems were tried to deal with the problem, usually by resorting to an under-bore bullet that expanded upon firing.|$|E
50|$|The Roth-Steyr pistol fires from {{an unusual}} style of locked breech. The bolt is very long. Its rear end is solid, {{except for a}} sleeve for the striker, but its front part is hollow and fits tightly over the barrel. The {{interior}} of the bolt has cam grooves cut into it, and the barrel has studs which fit into the grooves. When the pistol is fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together within the hollow receiver for about 0.5 inch. During this operation, the <b>helical</b> <b>grooves</b> in the muzzle bush cause the barrel to turn 90 degrees clockwise, after which it is held while the unlocked bolt continues to the rear, cocking the action as it does so. For safety with intended use by mounted cavalry, the pistol has a heavy trigger pull against the firing striker spring, similar to a hammerless revolver.|$|E
50|$|To avoid lateral {{drift of}} the batten as the lift lines pay {{out of the}} <b>grooved</b> drums, the <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> {{orientation}} on the drums of the line shaft may be alternated between drums to balance competing fleet angles. However the elimination of drift by this method is typically compromised by limited batten travel.|$|R

The isolator includes a first element forming a cylindrical core and a cup-shaped second element forming a sleeve portion that closely receives the core. The core has a <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> on its outside to form a passage between the groove and the inner walls of the sleeve. The core also has a vertical hole extending {{to the bottom of}} the core and a radial groove in the bottom of the core that extends between the hole and the bottom of the <b>helical</b> <b>groove...</b>|$|R
50|$|A needle gun is {{a firearm}} {{that has a}} {{needle-like}} firing pin, which can pass through the paper cartridge case to strike a percussion cap at the bullet base.

5000|$|A screw is a {{mechanism}} that converts rotational motion to linear motion, and a torque (rotational force) to a linear force. [...] It {{is one of}} the six classical simple machines. The most common form consists of a cylindrical shaft with <b>helical</b> <b>grooves</b> or ridges called threads around the outside. [...] The screw passes through a hole in another object or medium, with threads {{on the inside of the}} hole that mesh with the screw's threads. When the shaft of the screw is rotated relative to the stationary threads, the screw moves along its axis relative to the medium surrounding it; for example rotating a wood screw forces it into wood. In screw mechanisms, either the screw shaft can rotate through a threaded hole in a stationary object, or a threaded collar such as a nut can rotate around a stationary screw shaft. [...] Geometrically, a screw can be viewed as a narrow inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|The Sterling submachine gun is {{constructed}} entirely {{of steel and}} plastic and has a shoulder stock, which folds underneath the weapon. There is an adjustable rear-sight, which can be flipped between 100 and 200 yard settings. Although of conventional blowback design firing from an open bolt, there are some unusual features: for example, the bolt has <b>helical</b> <b>grooves</b> cut into the surface to remove dirt and fouling {{from the inside of}} the receiver to increase reliability. There are two concentric recoil springs which cycle the bolt, as opposed to the single spring arrangement used by many other SMG designs. This double-spring arrangement significantly reduces [...] "bolt-bounce" [...] when cartridges are chambered, resulting in better obturation, smoother recoil and increased accuracy. Additionally, the Sterling uses a much-improved (over the Sten) 34-round curved double-column feed box magazine, which is inserted into {{the left side of the}} receiver. The magazine follower, which pushes the cartridges into the feed port, is equipped with rollers to reduce friction. The bolt feeds ammunition alternately from the top and bottom of the magazine lips, and its fixed firing pin is designed so that it does not line up with the primer in the cartridge until the cartridge has entered the chamber.|$|E

A series of models were made and tested, including smooth and rough cylinders with and without grooves. The maximum Reynolds number achieved in the tests was about 4 x 10 (5). The comparative results between the smooth and grooved cylinders show that the <b>helical</b> <b>grooves</b> reduce the drag loading by between 18 and 25 % depending upon the cylinder surface roughness and the Reynolds number.

40|$|Chiral spoof surface plasmon polaritons in the {{terahertz}} region, {{resulting from}} a coherent superposition of TM and HE modes, can be generated by normally exciting helically corrugated metal wire with a linearly polarized Gaussian light. The handedness of the chiral SPP depends on the handedness of the <b>helical</b> <b>groove.</b> The chirality of the surface wave causes a spiral spatial extent of average power whose period {{is determined by the}} difference in the wave vector between two modes. Simultaneously, highly circular polarization of a confined surface wave emerges from the chirality of the geometry. Moreover, the polarization state is heavily dependent on working frequency relative to the characteristic frequency of each mode.

40|$|A dirt {{separator}} and excluder for removing entrained debris from gas turbine shaft seals is described. A <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> pattern is constructed on {{the rotating shaft}} with the pumping pattern such that it tends to pump seal pressurizing gas toward the gas turbine seal. A second <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> pattern is provided on the stationary housing or counter rotating member coaxial with the shaft, and this pattern {{is designed to provide}} pumping in the direction opposite from that of the groove pattern on the shaft. Gas with entrained debris entering this grooved area will be subjected to high centrifugal forces due to the swirl motion induced by the groove pattern and the rotation of the shaft. This debris is centrifuged outwardly into the outer groove pattern on the housing or counter rotating member. Because the outer groove pattern has a pumping direction opposite from that of the seal, dirt is pumped away from the seal and can be collected in a suitable debris trap remote from the seal location...|$|R
40|$|The RecA/RAD 51 {{nucleoprotein}} filament {{is central}} to the reaction of homologous recombination (HR). Filament activity must be tightly regulated in vivo as unrestrained HR can cause genomic instability. Our mechanistic understanding of HR is restricted by lack of structural information about the regulatory proteins that control filament activity. Here, we describe a structural and functional analysis of the HR inhibitor protein RecX and its mode of interaction with the RecA filament. RecX is a modular protein assembled of repeated three-helix motifs. The relative arrangement of the repeats generates an elongated and curved shape that is well suited for binding within the <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> of the RecA filament. Structure-based mutagenesis confirms that conserved basic residues on the concave side of RecX are important for repression of RecA activity. Analysis of RecA filament dynamics in the presence of RecX shows that RecX actively promotes filament disassembly. Collectively, our data support a model in which RecX binding to the <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> of the filament causes local dissociation of RecA protomers, leading to filament destabilisation and HR inhibition...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{have been carried}} out {{to examine the effects of}} triplestarting <b>helical</b> <b>grooves</b> on the drag of fixed circular cylinders and the vortex-induced vibration of elastically supported cylinders. For the elastically supported cylinder, the Reynolds number varied from 1. 3 x 104 to 4. 6 x 104, whilst for the fixed cylinder from 3. 1 x 104 to 3. 75 x 105. A comparative approach which allows direct comparisons of the results was adopted where two cylinders of identical dimensions and physical properties with or without helical surface grooves were tested in exactly same experimental set-ups. In the elastically supported cylinder tests, the cylinders were attached to a vertically cantilevered supporting rod and towed in a towing tank. Both the in-line and cross-flow vibrations were permitted. In the fixed cylinder tests, the cylinders were supported on rigid vertical struts and towed horizontally in the same towing tank. It is found that for the case investigated the <b>helical</b> <b>grooves</b> were effective in suppressing the vortex-induced cross-flow vibration amplitudes with the peak amplitude reduced by 64 %. Drag reductions of up to 25 % were also achieved in the sub-critical Reynolds number range tested in the study for the fixed cylinders...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} that a simple stirred batch cell can be used to study the effects of surface shear stress (among other process parameters) on fouling from saturated calcium salt solutions. For otherwise identical operating conditions, the overall fouling rate on a smooth mild steel surface was found to be reduced either when fine wires were attached to it or when helical threads were incorporated into the surface, either in the form of a continuous <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> or in the form of a raised helix. The raised helical surface was more effective in reducing fouling than the <b>helical</b> <b>groove.</b> The results confirm the general effect that fouling rates can be reduced by increasing the surface shear stress through surface enhancement. A simple mathematical model has been developed to take into account the dynamic change in bulk concentration as crystallization fouling occurs. In all cases, the overall fouling resistance increased asymptotically toward a constant value and could easily and accurately be described quantitatively by the new analytical model.
