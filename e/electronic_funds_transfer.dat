A gang of hackers under his leadership had breached Citicorp's security 40 times during 1994. They were able to transfer $12 million from customer accounts and withdraw an estimated $400,000.|$|E

25|$|In March 2002, two PayPal account holders {{separately}} {{sued the}} company for alleged violations of the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Funds</b> <b>Transfer</b> Act (EFTA) and California law. Most of the allegations concerned PayPal's dispute resolution procedures. The two lawsuits were merged into one class action lawsuit (In re: PayPal litigation). An informal settlement was reached in November 2003, and a formal settlement was signed on June 11, 2004. The settlement requires that PayPal change its business practices (including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them EFTA-compliant), as well as making a US$9.25 million payment {{to members of the}} class. PayPal denied any wrongdoing.|$|E
25|$|Retailers {{must also}} plan for {{customer}} preferred payment modes– e.g., cash, credit, lay-by, <b>Electronic</b> <b>Funds</b> <b>Transfer</b> at Point-of-Sale (EFTPOS). All payment options require {{some type of}} handling and attract costs. If credit is to be offered, then credit terms {{will need to be}} determined. If lay-by is offered, then the retailer will need {{to take into account the}} storage and handling requirements. If cash is the dominant mode of payment, the retailer will need to consider small change requirements, the number of cash floats required, wages costs associated with handling large volumes of cash and the provision of secure storage for change floats. Large retailers, handling significant volumes of cash, may need to hire security service firms to carry the day's takings and deliver supplies of small change. A small, but increasing number of retailers are beginning to accept newer modes of payment including PayPal and Bitcoin. For example, Subway (US) recently announced that it would accept Bitcoin payments.|$|E

The rebate is meant to eliminate the taxation of household necessities and make the plan progressive. Households would register once a year with their sales tax administering authority, providing the names and social security numbers of each household member.

2500|$|Cash {{dividends}} are {{the most}} common form of payment and are paid out in currency, usually via <b>electronic</b> <b>funds</b> <b>transfer</b> or a printed paper check. Such dividends are a form of investment income and are usually taxable to the recipient in the year they are paid. This is the most common method of sharing corporate profits with the shareholders of the company. For each share owned, a declared amount of money is distributed. Thus, if a person owns 100 shares and the cash dividend is 50 cents per share, the holder of the stock will be paid $50. [...] Dividends paid are not classified as an expense, but rather a deduction of retained earnings. [...] Dividends paid does not show up on an income statement but does appear on the balance sheet.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, PayPal is {{licensed}} as a money transmitter, on a state-by-state basis. But {{state laws}} vary, as do their definitions of banks, narrow banks, money services businesses and money transmitters. [...] Although PayPal is not {{classified as a}} bank, the company is subject {{to some of the}} rules and regulations governing the financial industry including Regulation E consumer protections and the USA PATRIOT Act. The most analogous regulatory source of law for PayPal transactions comes from P2P payments using credit and debit cards. Ordinarily, a credit card transaction, specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder, is governed by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1667f as implemented by Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226, (TILA/Z). TILA/Z requires specific procedures for billing errors, dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges. Similarly, the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Funds</b> <b>Transfer</b> Act (EFTA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1693-1693r, as implemented by Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. 205, (EFTA/E). EFTA/E is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures. However, because PayPal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly, TILA/Z and EFTA/E do not operate exactly as written once the credit/debit card transaction occurs via PayPal. Basically, unless a PayPal transaction is funded with a credit card, the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller.|$|E
