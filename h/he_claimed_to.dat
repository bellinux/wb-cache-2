5|$|Channel Orange (stylized as channel ORANGE) is the 2012 debut studio album by American R {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Frank Ocean.

5|$|George Pickingill {{was the son}} of Charles Pickingill, a {{labourer}} and blacksmith, and Susannah Cudner, a {{woman who}} also went by the name of Hannah Cudmore; the couple had married on 17 September 1813. Although he had no known birth record, according to parish records, George Pickingill was baptised on 26 May 1816 at the church in Hockley. The year of Pickingill's birth is however in question, as he made differing claims in different censuses; in the 1851 census, <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> be 26, meaning that his birth would have occurred circa 1825, while in the 1861 census, <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> be 46, which would have placed his birth c.1815. By the time of the 1901 census, he was claiming to be 95, moving his birth to c.1806; {{it has been suggested that}} he made himself appear older to ease the process of collecting parish assistance from the church. Throughout his life, Pickingill would also use a variety of different spellings of his surname on official records, including Pickengill, Pickingale, Pickengal, Pettingale, Pitengale, and Pittengale.|$|E

Earp was in charge of collecting license fees for Lamar, which funded local schools, and he was accused of failing to turn in the fees. On March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against Earp, alleging that Earp had falsified court documents about the amount of money collected from Cromwell to satisfy a judgment. To make up the difference between what Earp turned in and Cromwell owed (which <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> have paid), the court seized Cromwell's mowing machine and sold it for $38. Cromwell's suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, the estimated value of the machine.|$|E
