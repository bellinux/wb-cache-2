50|$|In 1956, Vermeer Manufacturing Company {{became one}} of two {{organizations}} to introduce the <b>hay</b> <b>conditioner</b> to the agricultural market. By 1960, nearly 5,000 units had been sold to the farm industry. A major breakthrough in the agriculture industry was {{the development of the}} round baler.|$|E
50|$|Haybine is {{the brand}} name of the first mower-conditioner. It {{combined}} the sickle bar mower and the <b>hay</b> <b>conditioner</b> to promote faster drying hay all in one process. The current versions produced by New Holland are branded the Discbine, since they now feature faster disc mowers.|$|E
50|$|A {{conditioner}} (or <b>hay</b> <b>conditioner)</b> is a {{farm implement}} that crimps and crushes newly cut hay to promote {{faster and more}} even drying. Drying the hay efficiently is most important for first cutting of the hay crop, which consists of coarse stalks that take {{a longer period of}} time to draw out moisture than finer textured hays, such as second and subsequent cuttings.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{prominent}} tractor division, IH also sold several {{different types of}} farm-related equipment, such as balers, cultivators, combines (self-propelled and pull behind), combine heads, corn shellers, cotton pickers, manure spreaders, hay rakes, crop dusters, disk harrows, elevators, feed grinders, hammer mills, <b>hay</b> <b>conditioners,</b> milking machines, planters, mills, discs, plows, and miscellaneous equipment.|$|R
50|$|The largest genus, Epicauta, {{contains}} many species toxic to horses. A few beetles consumed {{in a single}} feeding of alfalfa hay may be lethal. In semiarid areas of the western United States, modern harvesting techniques may contribute to cantharidin content in harvested forage. The practice of hay conditioning, crushing the stalks to promote drying, also crushes any beetles present and causes the release of cantharidin into the fodder. Blister beetles are attracted to alfalfa and weeds during bloom. Reducing weeds and timing harvests before and after bloom are sound management practices. Using equipment without <b>hay</b> <b>conditioners</b> may reduce beetle mortality {{and allow them to}} escape before baling.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 888 {{randomly}} selected dairy farmers {{participated in an}} epidemiological study to evaluate the prevalence of precipitins to farmer's lung antigens, and the socioeconomic factors associated with their presence. Precipitins were present in 75 farmers (8. 4 %) (65 to Micropolyspora faeni, seven to Aspergillus spp, two to both Aspergillus and Micropolyspora faeni, and one to Aspergillus and Thermoactinomyces vulgaris). The titres ranged from a dilution of 1 / 32 to a concentration of X 2 (Ouchterlony's double diffusion method). In the study population there were 544 who had never smoked, 146 ex-smokers, and 198 smokers. Sixty nine precipitin positive subjects were either never smokers or ex-smokers; only six were smokers. The negative relationship between cigarette smoking and precipitins was highly significant (p = 0. 004). Factors positively associated with positive precipitin reactions were: size of farm, {{time spent in the}} barn, and the presence of a family member previously diagnosed as having farmer's lung disease. Interestingly, positive precipitin reactions were not associated with any of the following: use of silos, <b>hay</b> <b>conditioners,</b> or <b>hay</b> dryers; the presence or quantity of mouldy hay; or the presence of respiratory symptoms. It is concluded that precipitin analysis is not useful as a screening method for farmer's lung, though it can be of diagnostic value in acute farmer's lung disease...|$|R
50|$|Somerville took a <b>hay</b> <b>conditioner</b> to McLaren {{transport}} {{to get a}} tyre changed. McLaren's employee Stumbles undertook to change the tyre, although he had little training in changing tyres. As Stumbles {{was unable to find}} a 15 inch tyre in stock, he then proceeded to try an fit a 15 1/2 inch tyre instead. After 3 attempts at inflating the incorrect sized tyre, it finally exploded, injuring Somerville whom was assisting Stumbles with the tyre.|$|E
50|$|Hay can be raked into rows {{as it is}} cut, {{then turned}} {{periodically}} to dry, particularly if a modern swather is used. Or, especially with older equipment or methods, the hay is cut and allowed to lie spread {{out in the field}} until it is dry, then raked into rows for processing into bales afterwards. During the drying period, which can take several days, the process is usually sped up by turning the cut hay over with a hay rake or spreading it out with a tedder. If it rains while the hay is drying, turning the windrow can also allow it to dry faster. However, turning the hay too often or too roughly can also cause drying leaf matter to fall off, reducing the nutrients available to animals. Drying can also be sped up by mechanized processes, such as use of a <b>hay</b> <b>conditioner,</b> or by use of chemicals sprayed onto the hay to speed evaporation of moisture, though these are more expensive techniques, not in general use except in areas where there is a combination of modern technology, high prices for hay, and too much rain for hay to dry properly.|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies are}} {{reviewed}} which relate the daily variation in total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) to hay quality, implications for animal preference studies and hay tests, forage intake by animals, and resulting animal production. From these results {{we conclude that}} TNC concentrations in alfalfa can increase linearly during the day. Alfalfa forage samples taken for animal preference or TNC analyses should be taken within lh to control daily variation within 5 %. We estimate 136 (first cutting) and 81 lbs TNC/ac (fourth cutting) increase by PM- versus AM-cutting. Increasing windrow width in heavy hay from 48 to 60 in windrow allows for faster dry-down, however in light hay increased windrow width is not necessary. The "super conditioner " may provide faster dry-down of alfalfa hay in some conditions. Key Words: alfalfa, <b>hay</b> quality, super <b>conditioner,</b> windrow widt...|$|R
