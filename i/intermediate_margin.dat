40|$|After {{retreat from}} the Angermünder ice margin, the Weichselian inland ice sheet fell apart into {{different}} independently acting glaciers in the eastern Uckermark. In {{the area of the}} Ucker lakes three ice margins are known, from south to north: the Zichow-Golm <b>intermediate</b> <b>margin,</b> the Gerswalde margin and the Ucker margin. This paper postulates two more ice margins: a Welse North Ice Margin and a Welse South Ice Margin. The Welse South Ice Margin is a ridge in the area south of the Welse stream and can be followed over the villages Zehnebeck - Wendemark - Passow - Herrenhof - Berkholz. The Welse South Ice Margin is seen as a possible simultaneous continuation of the Zichow-Golm ice margin. Unique drainage paths and sandur at the Zichow-Golm margin and the Welse South Ice Margin could not be found. On the other hand, the meltwater of these ice margins formed so-called ‘Bändertone’ (thinly laminated clays or varved clays) in the area south of Günterberg - Biesenbrow. In the area of Wartin - Schönow - Kunow - Hohenfelde a distinct ridge can also be seen, the so-called Welse North Ice Margin. It is conceived as a possible simultaneous continuation of the Gerswalde margin. The meltwater direction was from north to south and between Wartin and Blumberg a sandur terrace was formed at a level of 50 - 60 m above NHN in the Randow Valley. Probably the meltwater flowed toward Güntersberg where on this second occasion varved clays (Bändertone) were formed. The Oder Valley and the Schönow-Tantow Valley were formed already at that time as subglacial valleys...|$|E
40|$|Nach Auflösung der Angermünder Eisrandlage kam es im Weichselspätglazial zu verschiedenen unabhängig voneinander wirkenden Gletscherzungen in der östlichen Uckermark. Im Bereich der Uckerseen sind drei Eisrandlagen bekannt und zwar von Süd nach Nord: die Zichow-Golmer Zwischenstaffel, die Gerswalder Staffel und die Uckerstaffel (Chrobok et al. 1982). In der östlichen Uckermark dagegen sind bisher zwischen der Angermünder Staffel und der Penkuner Staffel keine Eisrandlagen beschrieben worden. In dieser Arbeit werden zwei weitere Eisrandlagen postuliert: eine Welsesüdrandlage und eine Welsenordrandlage.

In {{the area of the}} Ucker lakes three ice margins are known, from south to north: the Zichow-Golm <b>intermediate</b> <b>margin,</b> the Gerswalde margin and the Ucker margin (Chrobok et al 1982). To date, no ice margins between the Angermünder and Penkuner margins have been described in the eastern Uckermark (bordering Poland). This paper postulates two more ice margins: a Welse North Ice Margin and a Welse South Ice Margin. The Welse South Ice Margin is a ridge in the area south of the Welse stream and can be followed over the villages Zehnebeck - Wendemark - Passow - Herrenhof - Berkholz. The Welse South Ice Margin is seen as a possible simultaneous continuation of the Zichow-Golm ice margin. On the Geological Map 1 : 100, 000 push moraines have been registered in several places in this area. They constitute a proof of the pressure of the ice from the (East-) Northeast. Subglacial valleys developed, but unique drainage paths and sandur at the Zichow- Golm margin and the Welse South Ice Margin could not be found. On the other hand, the meltwater of these ice margins formed so-called ‘Bändertone’ (thinly laminated clays or varved clays) in the area south of Günterberg - Biesenbrow.

40|$|A large seismic dataset {{has allowed}} us to {{regionally}} study the West Mediterranean Sea with particular focus on the West Sardinia and South Balearic continental margins and adjacent oceanic basins. The main seismic and geological evidences {{are related to the}} presence of the Messinian Trilogy in the deep basins and lower slopes, and coeval erosional truncation on the <b>intermediate</b> and upper <b>margins.</b> During the deposition of the upper Messinian sequence (UU), a thin salt layer has been highlighted, thanks to the high resolution of recent profiles. This salt layer, precipitated during the initial re-filling of the Mediterranean Sea, has been correlated to an erosional surface on the lower slope inner the UU and interpreted as the effect of a temporary sea level drop. The underlying salt layer (MU) shows halokinetic deformations in the deep basins which started since the Upper Messinian and developed principally during the Pliocene, sometimes until the Present, as testified by sea bottom piercings. The halokinetics has affected by different intensity, on the base of its original thickness, of the sediments and water load, and of the proximity of the lower slopes, where the sliding of salt toward the deep basin determined compressive stress and enhancing diapirism...|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{important}} role that transportation, wholesaling, and retailing activities, {{commonly referred to as}} distribution or marketing activities, play most economies, a project is underway to develop a GTAP model and database that includes domestic margins. This paper reports on the type of margin data that has been collected and draws some general conclusions that will be useful in developing a margin inclusive database. Margins do vary considerably across different uses with margins on goods consumed by private households tending to be higher than <b>margins</b> on <b>intermediate</b> inputs and <b>margins</b> on exported commodities. For most commodities, wholesale and retail trade activities comprise the majority of the total margin regardless of use. While the average margins on processed food products tend to be similar, except for beverages and tobacco which is significantly higher, there is substantial variation in these margins across countries. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients between all processed food products, except for beverages and tobacco, are all positive and significantly different than zero indicating that for processed foods, countries tend to have either relatively high or relatively low margins for all processed food products. Finally, the size of the processed food margins are in general negatively related to per-capita GDP and positively related to per-capita energy consumption.

40|$|Transportation, wholesaling, and {{retailing}} {{activities are}} a significant segment of economic activity in many economies. The magnitude of these activities can vary greatly between products, users, and regions. However, in most applied general equilibrium (AGE) analyses, these marketing activities are not tied to specific commodities. This paper develops a framework for incorporating domestic marketing margins on domestic and imported goods going to final demand or used as <b>intermediate</b> inputs, and <b>margins</b> on exports into the standard GTAP model. Empirical applications that focus on technological change at the farm, processor, and wholesale/retail segment of food marketing chain illustrate three key findings concerning including domestic marketing activities in AGE models. First, the inclusion of domestic margins reduces the degree of producer price changes transmitted to consumers. Therefore, by not explicitly treating domestic margin activities, AGE models will overestimate the welfare gains from technological change, or any policy liberalization. Second, {{the magnitude of the}} elasticity of substitution between commodities and the composite marketing activity is a key parameter. Significant model results are obtained depending on whether the domestic marketing margins are assumed to be fixed or are allowed to vary. Finally, when considering technological change at the farm, processing, and wholesale/retail trade levels of food marketing channel, the welfare gains appear to be much greater the closer one gets to consumers...|$|R

This paper develops a model framework and database that incorporates domestic marketing margins on domestic and imported goods going to final demand or used as <b>intermediate</b> inputs, and <b>margins</b> on exports, into the standard GTAP Model. The effects of incorporating domestic marketing activities into an AGE model are illustrated {{by comparing the results}} of the standard GTAP Model to the new GTAP-M Model for several different technological change scenarios. The comparison yields two main results. First, tying the domestic marketing activities to specific commodities changes the degree of price transmission from producers to users, compared to a model that does not include margin activities explicitly. For example, the reduction in the crop price due to global technical change in the crop sector is completely passed through to consumers in the standard GTAP Model while only about fifty to eighty percent of the reduction in the crop price is passed through to consumers in the GTAP-M Model. This leads to smaller increases in the quantity demanded and therefore smaller increases in crop production following the technical change. The second main result i...|$|R
40|$|A gradual rise in Earth's surface {{temperature}} marks {{a transition from}} the late Paleocene to the early Eocene ca. 58 - 51 Ma. Paleocene/Eocene boundary (∼ 55. 5 Ma) sediments deposited {{in the midst of}} this slow warming ubiquitously reveal evidence for a massive isotopically light carbon injection and an associated rapid but transient global warming event, or hyperthermal, that has been termed the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) and attributed to a carbon injection from multiple potential sources. The PETM has gained importance over the past two decades as a potential geologic analog to the modern anthropogenic carbon injection and climate change. However significant questions surrounding the nature of the carbon injection at the onset of the PETM remain. The Clarence River valley, located in the Marlborough region, South Island, New Zealand, contains a series of outcrops of lithified late Paleocene to early Eocene sediments originally deposited on a paleo-slope margin. Within these sections, the Lower Limestone Member of the Amuri Limestone Formation records the interval of interest. A Lower Limestone prominent recessed unit consisting of multiple marl-rich beds and recording a pronounced negative carbon isotopic excursion (CIE) marks the PETM at sections that have been bisected by tributaries to the Clarence River, including Mead Stream and Dee Stream. Here I detail and discuss Clarence valley Lower Limestone sections and relate these records to global trends with an emphasis on adding constraints to the PETM carbon injection. Specifically, I document the lithologic and carbon isotopic expression of the PETM and two younger paired sets of early Eocene events that, similar to the Mead Stream and Dee Stream PETM sections, reveal negative CIEs and expanded marl-rich units coincident to identical CIEs and condensed carbonate dissolution horizons in deep-sea sections. I further quantify the abundance of bioturbating macrofauna trace fossils through the PETM at both Mead Stream and Dee Stream and argue that New Zealand <b>margin</b> <b>intermediate</b> waters became hypoxic precisely coincident to the PETM carbon injection. In concert, these findings suggest a PETM carbon addition mechanism capable of both diminishing intermediate water dissolved oxygen and of repeated early Eocene injections. U. S.
