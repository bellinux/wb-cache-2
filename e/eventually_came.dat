5|$|Despite Pinkertons mixed reception, {{in later}} years it {{garnered}} enduring sales, critical acclaim and cult status through internet word-of-mouth, and <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> to be considered among Weezer's best work by fans and critics.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{concerns}} over the potential cost, construction of the Memorial <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> in at £400,000 under budget, in part because {{a number of the}} contractors concerned carried out their work free of charge.|$|E

5|$|In 1923 Trotter <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> to {{an uneasy}} truce with the NAACP. His {{attempts}} {{to promote his}} style of activism, however, were eclipsed by activities of younger leaders, such as Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican immigrant in New York City {{and leader of the}} UNIA.|$|E

5|$|Bent {{received}} his first call {{up to the}} senior England team for the friendly against Denmark on 17 August, but did not play in the match. His England debut <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> on 1 March 2006, when he started against Uruguay at Anfield in a pre-2006 FIFA World Cup friendly match. He {{was not included in}} England's World Cup squad when it was announced in May 2006.|$|E

5|$|Bonifacio and the Katipunan {{started the}} Philippine Revolution in 1896. A {{faction of the}} Katipunan, the Magdalo of Cavite province, <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> to {{challenge}} Bonifacio's position {{as the leader of}} the revolution and Emilio Aguinaldo took over. In 1898, the Spanish–American War began in Cuba and reached the Philippines. Aguinaldo declared Philippine independence from Spain in Kawit, Cavite on June 12, 1898, and the First Philippine Republic was established in the Barasoain Church in the following year.|$|E
5|$|Exact {{details of}} her death <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> to light; she boarded a packed boat with 70 other people {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mediterranean Sea and reach Italy. The boat soon ran out of petrol and was adrift off the coast of Libya. When an Italian Navy vessel arrived to offer assistance, it threw ropes over the side to the refugees. In the chaos that ensued as people {{attempting}} to grab the ropes, Omar was knocked into the sea, where witnesses saw her treading water for a while, but eventually drowned.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{after the}} American Revolution, {{parts of the}} area now known as Ohio were claimed by New York, Virginia, and Connecticut; however, New York ceded its claim in 1782, Virginia in 1784, and Connecticut in 1786, though it {{maintained}} its Western Reserve in the area until 1800. On July 13, 1787, the Northwest Territory was formed. As territories were split from it, one of them <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> to represent the area of present-day Ohio.|$|E

5|$|Palestine {{had been}} a British Mandate {{since the end of}} World War I. Under the terms of the mandate, Great Britain was {{responsible}} for the government and security of the country. It had long been a stated British aim to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine and between 1922 and 1939 over 250,000 Jewish immigrants had arrived in the country. However, Arab resistance and World War II prompted the British to curtail immigration. The time also saw the rise of the Jewish Resistance Movement, which <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> into conflict with the British authorities.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{to small}} audiences, on tiny stages, in {{communal}} troupes where {{all but the}} stars had day jobs, and playing only Saturday and Sunday (the pious London Jews would never have tolerated Friday performances), Adler focused on serious theater like never before. However, he and Grodner soon fell out: they wrangled over ideology and over parts, and their verbal duels boiled over into improvised stage dialogue. The Grodners ultimately left to do theater {{in a series of}} other locations, notably Paris, but <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> back to London, where Israel Grodner died in 1887.|$|E
5|$|Representations of America as {{a female}} Native American, or Indian princess, dated back to the 16thcentury; cartographers would place a native woman, often wearing a {{feathered}} headdress, upon their version of the North American continent. This evolved into an image of an Indian queen, then an Indian princess, and although Columbia <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> to be the favored female embodiment of the United States, {{the image of the}} Indian princess survives in the popular view of such figures as Pocahontas and Sacagawea.|$|E

5|$|The American League {{defeated}} the National League by {{a score of}} 5–4. Ichiro Suzuki won the MVP award for the game for hitting the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star history. As per the 2006 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the American League champion (which <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> to be the Boston Red Sox) received home field advantage in the 2007 World Series. The victory was the 10th consecutive (excluding the 2002 tie) for the AL, and their 11-game unbeaten streak is only beaten by the NL's 11-game winning streak from 1972 to 1982 in All-Star history.|$|E
5|$|The Pilgrim {{settlers}} {{realized that}} they did not have a patent to settle in the region, so they signed the Mayflower Compact prior to disembarking. The Pilgrims explored various parts of Cape Cod, and eventually sought a suitable location for a permanent settlement to the westward in Cape Cod Bay. The Pilgrims <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> across the sheltered waters of Plymouth Harbor on December 17. The appealing protected bay led to a site in the present-day Harbor District being chosen for the new settlement after three days of surveying.|$|E
5|$|The {{place name}} Orange has a {{separate}} etymology. The Roman-Celtic settlement {{was founded in}} 36 or 35 BC and originally named Arausio, after a Celtic water god. The Principality of Orange was named for this place {{and not for the}} color. Some time after the sixteenth century, though, the color orange was adopted as a canting symbol of the House of Orange-Nassau. The color <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> to be associated with Protestantism, due to participation by the House of Orange on the Protestant side in the French Wars of Religion and the Dutch Eighty Years' War.|$|E

5|$|A {{surprisingly}} fast {{beginning to}} the stage, with a first hour that covered over , {{managed to keep}} any breakaways from going clear for over two hours. Twelve <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> ahead of the peloton, with seven in the lead and five chasing between the leaders and the peloton. The third group on the road eventually dwindled to a select contingent of overall favorites, which included race leader Danilo Di Luca. Former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli attacked from this group on the day's first climb and got to the leading group of five before the summit, claiming maximum points on it and on Sestrière to gain leadership of the mountains classification {{at the end of}} the day. Garzelli's maximum advantage, at the summit of Sestrière, was just over six minutes.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse was {{initially}} lauded for bringing professional football to the Tampa Bay area, but <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> {{to be blamed}} for the team's struggles. His refusal to pay Doug Williams at a salary level {{comparable to that of}} the league's top quarterbacks insulted fans, and was seen as the beginning of the team's decline during the 1980s. It further led to the belief that Culverhouse was unconcerned with fielding a winning team, {{as long as it was}} financially profitable. The Buccaneers' NFL-record streak of fourteen consecutive losing seasons cemented this perception, although Culverhouse did make several notable attempts to improve the team.|$|E
5|$|During this {{conflict}} and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners' differences using {{a mixture of}} friendship and business acumen. Sullivan asked {{to be released from}} the partnership on several occasions. Nevertheless, Carte was able to coax eight comic operas out of his partners in the 1880s. When Princess Ida closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, {{for the first time in}} the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready. Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert <b>eventually</b> <b>came</b> up with a new idea and began work in May 1884.|$|E
