The excited atomic oxygen (O*) cascades to the ground state while radiating light at a wavelength of 777.4  nm. Dissociative <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> molecular oxygen can also emit light at 777.4  nm, which comes from the E region. Hecht et al. (1985) obtained a high-resolution measurement of the atomic oxygen line at 777.4  nm [hereinafter written as OI (777.4)] with a Fabry–Perot interferometer, which consisted of two components: a narrow spectral portion, {{which is due to}} the <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> atomic oxygen <b>via</b> direct electron impact, and a broad portion, which is due to the dissociative <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> molecular oxygen <b>via</b> electron impact. However, the contribution of the latter component tends to be small, constituting no more than 5 % of the OI (777.4) emission intensity (Christensen et al. 1978). The volume emission rates of the OI (777.4) in the F region exceed those in the E region by a factor of 2 or more [see Figure  1 of Lanchester et al. (2009)].

40|$|It {{has been}} shown in recent {{experiments}} that electronic transport through a gold monatomic nanowire is dissipative above a threshold voltage due to <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> phonons <b>via</b> the electron-phonon interaction. We address that data by computing, via density functional theory, the zone boundary longitudinal phonon frequency of a perfect monatomic nanowire during its mechanical elongation. The theoretical frequency that we find for an ideally strained nanowire is not compatible with experiment if a uniformly distributed stretch is assumed. With the help of a semi-empirical Au-Au potential, we model the realistic nanowire stretching as exerted by two tips. In this model we see that strain tends to concentrate in the junctions, so that the mean strain of the nanowire is roughly one half of the ideal value. With this reduced strain, the calculated phonon softening is in much better agreement with experiment. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures, Surface Science, in pres...|$|R

The scattered distributions are probed via laser-induced fluorescence methods, which yield rotational and spin-orbit state populations that elucidate {{the dynamics of}} energy transfer at the gas-liquid interface. These collision dynamics are explored {{as a function of}} incident collision energy, surface temperature, scattering angle, and liquid identity, all of which are found to substantially affect the degree of rotational, electronic and vibrational <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> NO <b>via</b> collisions at the liquid surface. Rotational distributions observed reveal two distinct scattering pathways, (i) molecules that trap, thermalize and eventually desorb from the surface (trapping-desorption, TD), and (ii) those that undergo prompt recoil (impulsive scattering, IS) prior to complete equilibration with the liquid surface. Thermally desorbing NO molecules are found to have rotational temperatures close to, but slightly cooler than the surface temperature, indicative of rotational dependent sticking probabilities on liquid surfaces. Nitric oxide is a radical with multiple low-lying electronic states that serves as an ideal candidate for exploring nonadiabatic state-changing collision dynamics at the gas-liquid interface, which induce significant excitation from ground (2 Π 1 / 2) to excited (2 Π 3 / 2) spin–orbit states.

The effects of DA and QUIN were clearly dose-dependent: small amounts caused a weak and transient facilitation of visual activity (10 – 30 % increase) preferentially in Y-type relay cells, which changed to a moderate reduction of visual responses when the dose was increased (50 %, maximal 70 %). The effect of SKF was mainly suppressive and increased {{with the amount of}} drug applied (up to 90 % reduction). The selective antagonists SCH 23390 (SCH, D 1) and sulpiride (SULP, D 2) reduced the effects of co-applied DA agonists. We found little evidence for a specific dopaminergic modulation of the surround inhibition (stimulus-driven lateral inhibition) although DA slightly facilitated the transmission of weak signals (small stimuli). Nevertheless, some dopaminergic effects seem to be mediated via inhibitory interneurons regulating the strength of sustained or recurrent inhibition. Application of DA agonists during blockade of GABAA receptors indicates a direct suppression <b>of</b> relay cells <b>via</b> D 1 receptors, an <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> relay cells <b>via</b> D 2 receptors and - with increasing amounts of D 2 agonist - probably also an <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> inhibitory interneurons, which results in an indirect inhibition of dLGN relay cells (predominantly of the X-type).

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the transition between magnetorotationally active and dead zones in protoplanetary disks should be prone to the <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> vortices <b>via</b> Rossby wave instability (RWI). However, the only numerical evidence for this has come from alpha disk models, where the magnetic field evolution is not followed, and the effect of turbulence is parametrized by Lapla-cian viscosity. We aim to establish the phenomenology of the flow in the transition in 3 D resistive-magnetohydrodynamical models. We model the transition by a sharp jump in resistivity, as expected in the inner dead zone boundary, using the PENCIL CODE to simulate the flow. We find that vortices are readily excited in the dead side of the transition. We measure the mass accretion rate finding similar levels of Reynolds stress at the dead and active zones, at the α ≈ 10 − 2 level. The vortex sits in a pressure maximum and does not migrate, surviving {{until the end of the}} simulation. A pres-sure maximum in the active zone also triggers the RWI. The magnetized vortex that results should be disrupted by parasitical magneto-elliptic instabilities, yet it subsists in high resolution. This sug-gests that either the parasitic modes are still numerically damped, or that the RWI supplies vorticity faster than they can destroy it. We conclude that the resistive transition between the active and dead zones in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks, if sharp enough, can indeed excite vortices via RWI. Our results lend credence to previous works that relied on the alpha-disk approximation, and caution against the use of overly reduced azimuthal coverage on modeling this transition. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{gas phase}} {{selective}} hydrogenation {{of a series}} of nitroarenes (nitrobenzene, p-chloronitrobenzene, p-bromonitrobenzene, p-nitroaniline, p-nitrotoluene, p-nitrophenol and p-nitroanisole) has been examined over Au/TiO 2 (0. 3 % w/w Au, mean Au particle size = 3. 9 nm). Compensation behavior is demonstrated with an associated isokinetic temperature (T-iso) of 558 +/- 32 K. We account for this response in terms of the selective energy transfer (SET) model where the occurrence of resonance between catalyst and reactant vibrations generates the activated complex. An analysis of the stepwise variation of the activation energies has identified a critical vibrational frequency of 853 cm(- 1), which is close (+/- 2 cm(- 1)) to the reference value for nitro-group (in-plane symmetric O-N-O bending and stretching) vibrations. Application of SET suggests activation of weakly adsorbed nitroarene (at the support or metal/support interface) by <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> the nitro-group <b>via</b> IR radiation from a strongly adsorbed surface nitroarene component. The excited nitroarene is then attacked by reactive hydrogen supplied by the Au sites to generate the respective aromatic amine with 100 % selectivity. Agreement of the SET predicted T-iso with the experimental value requires the incorporation of a term due to C-N torsional entropy resulting from distortion of the O-N-O plane...|$|R
