5|$|California condors {{have the}} largest {{wingspan}} of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both body length and weight only by the trumpeter swan and the introduced mute swan. The American white pelican and whooping crane also have longer bodies than the condor. Condors are so large {{that they can be}} mistaken <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> distant airplane, which possibly occurs more often than they are mistaken for other species of bird.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Margaret Chaloner, {{wife of the}} first Lord Gisborough, laid out formal gardens of a typical late-Victorian and Edwardian design with {{elaborate}} bedding schemes and gravelled paths.

5|$|Kongsfjord Telemetry Station {{constituted}} one of {{the four}} initial ESTRACK ground stations which provided radio tracking and telemetry communication with ESRO's low Earth orbit satellites. The ground station communicated with the satellites in the 136–137MHz band. This was optimal for low-orbit satellites, allowed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> antenna dish but gave a low bit rate. The various satellites using the facility conducted measurements of solar radiation, cosmic radiation, the polar ionosphere, and ionizing and dynamic effects regarding electric currents and magnetic disturbances.|$|E

Together the three men began working on Longren's design for a new airplane, despite having no prior aviation experience or professional assistance. The trio built the prototype in complete secrecy, wishing to forestall publicity of any potential failures; they even disassembled the craft and transported it discreetly in boxes to its first flight trial.|$|E

5|$|The tufted tit-tyrant uses three {{different}} hunting strategies to catch its prey. Gleaning insects from a perch is its primary hunting strategy; while gleaning, the bird sits upright with its wings dropped below the tail, which is pointing straight down. From this position the tit-tyrant scans upwards into the vegetation {{for three to}} five seconds before attacking, making them surprisingly deliberate hunters <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> flycatcher.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} was first was {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Alauda spinoletta (characterised as A. rectricibus fuscis : extimis duabus oblique dimidiato-albis). The current genus Anthus was created for the pipits by German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1805. Anthus is the Latin name <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> bird of grasslands, and the specific spinoletta is a local dialect word for a pipit from the Florence area of Italy.|$|E

5|$|A 2004 {{article in}} USA Today {{suggested}} that playing Magic might help improve {{the social and}} mental skills {{of some of the}} players. The article interviewed players' parents who believe that the game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing Magic helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that Magic can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children's Magic obsession. In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> number of scholarships.|$|E
5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
