25|$|During an {{official}} visit to France in 1934, {{the king was}} assassinated in Marseille {{by a member of}} the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – an extreme nationalist organization in Bulgaria that had plans to annex territories along the eastern and southern Yugoslav border—with the cooperation of the Ustaše – a Croatian fascist separatist organization. The <b>international</b> <b>political</b> <b>scene</b> in the late 1930s was marked by growing intolerance between the principal figures, by the aggressive attitude of the totalitarian regimes. Croatian leader Vlatko Maček and his party managed to extort the creation of the Croatian banovina (administrative province) in 1939. The agreement specified that Croatia was to remain part of Yugoslavia, but it was hurriedly building an independent political identity in international relations.|$|E

5000|$|Because of {{the vast}} array of presidential roles and responsibilities, coupled with a {{conspicuous}} presence on the national and <b>international</b> <b>scene,</b> <b>political</b> analysts have tended to place great emphasis on the president's powers.

5000|$|Relations {{between the}} two {{executive}} organs, however, returned to animosity under the presidency of Lech Kaczyński and Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Political rivals for years, fueled by the 2005 presidential poll which saw both men as the main challengers, Tusk's center-right Civic Platform toppled President Kaczyński's twin brother Jarosław's government in the 2007 parliamentary election. Tusk's support for stronger integration into the European Union, including {{the signing of the}} Lisbon Treaty, and a rapprochement with Russia, put Kaczyński directly at odds with the prime minister. From 2007 until Kaczyński's death in the Smolensk air disaster in 2010, policy differences {{between the two}} offices were a constant source of division, with the president employing his limited veto powers numerous times over the government's legislation; Tusk's government lacked a 60 percent threshold to overturn such vetoes. In response, Tusk made no secret his party's desire to replace Kaczyński in the 2010 presidential election. Although Tusk and Kaczyński found several areas of compromise, clashes between the Chancellery and the Presidential Palace became a regular feature in both the domestic and <b>international</b> <b>political</b> <b>scenes</b> for the next two and a half years. Frustrated by Kaczyński's veto, Prime Minister Tusk argued for a constitutional amendment in November 2009 to strip the presidency of its veto powers, declaring, [...] "The president should not have veto power. People make their decision in elections and then state institutions should not be in conflict...Let us change some provisions so we can have fewer conflicts and more cooperation. We propose changes to the constitution so that the center of power lies with the government...The presidential veto brings more harm than good." ...|$|R

Qatar has donated in excess of $1.6 billion to Syria in humanitarian aid for victims of the conflict in Syria, according to an article by Qatar’s foreign minister in Britain’s Daily Telegraph in February 2015, despite allegations in 2013 that $650m pledged to the UN remained undelivered.|$|E

The Ten Virtues of a sovereign were set down as guiding principles for Thai monarchs.

5000|$|Schubert {{was dead}} by 1828: Heines {{choice of the}} winter journey theme {{certainly}} alludes to the Winterreise, Müllers cycle of poems about lost love, which in Schuberts song-cycle {{of the same name}} became an immortal work embodying some more final and tragic statement about the human condition. Winterreise is about the exile of the human heart, and its bitter and gloomy self-reconciliation. Deutschland. Ein Wintermärchen transfers the theme to the <b>international</b> European <b>political</b> <b>scene,</b> his exile as a writer from his own homeland (where his heart is), and his Heimatssehnsucht or longing for the homeland. Thus Heine casts his secret and illegal thoughts, so that the darts of his satire and humour fly out from the tragic vortex of his own exile. The fact that Heines poetry was itself so closely identified with Schubert was part of his armoury of fire and weapons mentioned in the closing stanzas: he transformed Müllers lament into a lament for Germany.|$|R

50|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Recession, the Romanian <b>political</b> <b>scene</b> saw {{tensions}} between the president and prime minister and between the general population and both. Tensions escalated with a 2012 political crisis and another attempt to impeach President Băsescu. In the referendum, more than 7.4 million people (nearly 90 percent) supported Băsescu's removal from office. However, the Constitutional Court invalidated the referendum because {{the majority of the population}} did not vote (the voter turnout was 46%); Băsescu had called the referendum a coup d'état, and asked the public to boycott it. All these events have been heavily criticized by <b>international</b> <b>political</b> figures.|$|R

In October 2003, he invited the presidents of Finland, Germany, as well as of soon-to-be EU members Hungary, Latvia and Poland to Arraiolos in order to discuss the consequences of the 2004 enlargement of the European Union and plans for a Constitution for Europe. Such conventions of non-executive presidents of EU member states have become a regular event, and have been dubbed Arraiolos meetings.|$|E

50|$|The time {{spend in}} the Middle East had endowed Nikitin {{with a deep}} insight into the Kurdish problem. He was, therefore, in a unique {{position}} to identify and understand the awakening of Kurdish nationalism. He closely studied the development of the Kurdish nationalism, classifying it in three phases. The first phase, which was marked by rioting, he referred to as the unorganized and directionless phase. The second phase, according to Nikitin, was the one that showed the first signs of organization. This phase was between 1880 and 1918. It was also the period during which the first Kurdish political parties and associations came into being. The third phase was the phase when the Kurds appeared as a political force on the <b>international</b> <b>political</b> <b>scene,</b> as demonstrated by historic agreements like the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920.|$|E
5000|$|In 1947, {{the format}} of Literaturnaya Gazeta was changed from a purely {{literary}} publication into a newspaper with political and social content as well. It was published weekly in an edition of sixteen pages, the first [...] "thick newspaper" [...] {{in a country where}} most newspapers were four to eight pages in length. The expanded newspaper not only took on a new look, but also acquired greater influence, becoming one of the most authoritative and influential publications. Though Literaturnaya Gazeta, like all newspapers during the Soviet period, faithfully reflected government policy (both political and literary), it showed, as much as possible, the human face of Soviet society, and was the national paper most likely to [...] "push the limits" [...] (though those limits were fairly severe). The newspaper published stories and poems that were often mundane and unimpressive, but occasionally published poetry and prose of quality. Most interesting to its readers were reports on the <b>international</b> <b>political</b> <b>scene,</b> and especially on cultural life in countries outside the Soviet sphere of influence.|$|E

40|$|At {{the dawn}} of the 21 st century, {{migration}} has emerged as a central issue in the <b>international</b> economic and <b>political</b> <b>scene</b> and as a crucial factor of societal change for many countries. Globalization and capitalist restructuring have not only altered the patterns of international migration (geographic, economic, political, cultural), but they are also themselves affected by the new multidimensional migration trends: migration is now a global phenomenon, one of the visible faces of globalization and one of its major driving forces. In Europe, given its long-standing history of population movements, migration has become a central issue in the political and economic agenda. On the one hand, the consolidation of new minorities challenges the concept and content of citizenship and therefore the nature of the welfare state itself, while concerns are raised about the worsening problems of racism and social exclusion. On the other hand, contemporary migration dynamics affect the process of European integration in various ways, for instance with respect to East–West mobility patterns and the new enlargement of the European Union (EU), or the increasing irregular migratory pressures and the building of the European ‘Fortress’. Within this context, the southern member states of the EU have been transformed from exporters of labour to new destination countries, as a result of both internal and international developments that have taken place during the past two or three decades. 1 The Greek case has certainly been part of this transformation, currently sharing similar migratio...|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{founding}} ideas of the New Universe was {{that the existence of}} paranormals would have real and lasting consequences, but so far these had been few and on the personal level. Gruenwald elaborated, [...] There was a big misunderstanding among all of the creators, myself included, that we should keep the New U the world outside your window -- that it should never change too much, or else we'd lose reader identification or something. We missed the point of having a virgin universe, uncluttered by known super-beings, aliens, other dimensions, hidden civilizations, and all that. The point is enabling the reader to experience the first time the weird stuff starts happening -- and, more importantly, letting the weird stuff actually affect the status quo of the world. [...] This changed in issue #12 of Star Brand, in which Ken Connell transfers a portion of the Star Brand to an inanimate object. This same issue reveals that a similar transfer of the Star Brand's power into an asteroid was the trigger for the White Event in the first place. Connell's effort results in a tremendous release of energy, which scoops out a massive crater, obliterating the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and most of the surrounding area in {{what became known as the}} Black Event. The crater that existed where Pittsburgh had once been became known as [...] "The Pitt," [...] and its creation marked a turn into a generally grimmer tone for the line, with a more militarized <b>international</b> <b>political</b> <b>scene,</b> and some themes of post-apocalyptic fiction being explored. The increasingly unstable political scene would have effects such as the forcible military recruitment of paranormals for a war with the Soviet Union (believed by the Americans to have caused the disaster), as portrayed in the graphic novel The Draft.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the night}} of 29/30 December, King Alexander of Yugoslavia proclaimed Obznana, a {{proclamation}} in which he forbade further activity of the KPJ. Thousands of communists were arrested and their organisations broken. After proclamation of Obznana, KPJ and SKOJ were scattered. Gorkić {{played a key role}} in reorganisation of the KPJ and SKOJ. He became Secretary of the Regional Committee of the SKOJ. In a report to KPJ's congress held in Vienna in 1922, Gorkić stated that before Obznana, regional SKOJ had 300 members, and after Obznana regional SKOJ did not have a single member, they only maintained contacts. He and his associates established an illegal organization as a core for future organizing. Soon, they had been provided with a hectograph to multiply propaganda leaflets. Gorkić was assigned to work with the leaflets. Before that, in 1921, he wrote to his illegal organisation in Derventa and this letter was found by the police. In the letter, Gorkić wrote in detail about organisation's activity and meeting place that was supposed to be held in Belgrade. However, the meeting never took place, because a communist, Spasoje Stević, made a failed assassination attempt on King Alexander, who was at the time, a regent. In July 1921 Gorkić visited Belgrade with his friend, Maks Schwarz, but, after they returned to Brod, both of them were arrested on 29 July. Gorkić stated to the police that he did not go to Belgrade because of the conference, but for education. Gorkić's activity was observed by the police for a longer period. Gorkić was heard by police on 2 August and spent six months in prison, when he was bailed out by the party along with other imprisoned communists. He was expelled from Commercial Academy when he was in third grade. He did not return home to his parents, but instead, continued his political activity. In time, while he was still imprisoned, Gorkić's family was deported back to Czechoslovakia. His father had been accused of communism and anti-Serb sentiment. After Gorkić had been released from prison, he started to work as an editor of Sarajevan workers' magazine [...] "Radničko jedinstvo" [...] (Workers' Unity). As an editor, he wrote about the <b>international</b> <b>political</b> <b>scene.</b> In 1923, Gorkić was employed in another magazine, named [...] "Narod" [...] (The People). He worked in this magazine until he left the country. During all that time, he was under police surveillance.|$|E
