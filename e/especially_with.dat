5|$|During this period, the Mycenaean centers {{witnessed}} increased {{contacts with}} the outside world and <b>especially</b> <b>with</b> the Cyclades and the Minoan centers in the island of Crete. Mycenaean presence appears to be also depicted in a fresco at Akrotiri, on Thera island, which possibly displays many warriors in Boar's tusk helmets, a feature typical of Mycenaean warfare. In the early 15th century, commerce intensified with Mycenaean pottery reaching the western coast of Asia Minor, including Miletus and Troy, Cyprus, Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt.|$|E

While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (<b>especially</b> <b>with</b> France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents on the dollar.|$|E
5|$|Holkham's north-facing coastal {{location}} {{can attract}} {{large numbers of}} migrating birds in autumn if the weather conditions are right, <b>especially</b> <b>with</b> a north to north-east wind.

Vagrant rarities such as Pallas's, Radde's or dusky warblers may occur; a red-breasted nuthatch in 1989 was the first, and, as of 2012, the only individual of its species to be recorded in the UK.|$|E
