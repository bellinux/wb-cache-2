5|$|Combined <b>Emergency</b> <b>Service</b> – {{these are}} full service <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> agencies, {{which may be}} found in places such as {{airports}} or large colleges and universities. Their key feature is that all personnel are trained not only in ambulance (EMT) care, but as a firefighter and a peace officer (police function). They {{may be found in}} smaller towns and cities, where size or budget does not warrant separate services. This multi-functionality allows {{to make the most of}} limited resource or budget, but having a single team respond to any emergency.|$|E

5|$|Local {{authorities}} closed airports, set up shelters, and readied <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> personnel.

In Dominica, tourists were evacuated to concrete shelters {{and the vast majority of}} foreign medical students from the Ross University School of Medicine evacuated the island. The government of Dominica also canceled leave for <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> personnel and evacuated Princess Margret Hospital, fearing that its roof might be vulnerable to the storm's winds. Martinique's main airport and both of St. Lucia's commercial airports closed when the last airplanes landed on the night of August 16 and the storm's outer rainbands began to sweep over the island.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{crews of}} the government's Department of Social Security (DSS) visited {{locations}} throughout the region, receiving damage claims, requests for monetary aid, and filings for unemployment benefits. The Commonwealth pledged to provide $150million in relief {{over a three-year}} period to the government of Queensland in exchange for deregulation; however, its offer was initially rejected. Planes flew claims adjusters and other officials to Innisfail, establishing an insurance <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> in the city hall, while the Insurance Council of Queensland deployed its special <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> employees for the first time. As a result of severe damage, a disaster declaration for northern regions was issued by Queensland Government on 4February. The first $10million in aid from the state government, paid by the federal government, was supplied the same day. Meanwhile, the SES continued its cleanup efforts, removing debris and repairing structures. Looters took advantage of confusion in the days following the cyclone, striking residences throughout Innisfail. By the end of the day, 2200tarpaulins had been distributed; however, the previously-smooth relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms in Cairns.|$|E

5|$|In more {{advanced}} developing countries, establishing ambulance transport systems is more feasible, but still requires considerable expertise and planning. Prior to 2004, Pakistan {{did not have}} an organized emergency medical system. In that year, Rescue 1122 was launched as a professional pre-hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>service,</b> and it has managed to achieve an average response time of 7 minutes, comparable to that of developed nations. Some of the critical factors in its success included local manufacture of vehicles, training instructors to certify emergency medical technicians, adopting training materials to the local context, and branching out to include fire and rescue service response under a united command structure.|$|E
5|$|In most countries, winter service {{vehicles}} usually have amber light bars, which are activated {{to indicate that}} the vehicle is operating below the local speed limit or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by straddling lanes or by spreading grit or de-icer. In some areas, such as the Canadian province of Ontario, winter {{service vehicles}} use the blue flashing lights associated with <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> vehicles, rather than the amber or orange used elsewhere. Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast orange or yellow to allow the vehicles to be seen more clearly in whiteout conditions.|$|E

SES workers worked to help the community recover, tarping damaged roofs and clearing debris from roads and around houses where it limited access from residents. Most work involved clearing vegetation from power lines to enable Western Power to begin repairs. Volunteers from other Western Australian cities and towns such as Perth, Bunbury, Karratha, Derby and Tom Price had arrived to assist with requests for help. During the recovery period, the SES earned huge public respect, and residents were pleased with the quick response of the SES.|$|E
5|$|The {{onset of}} World War II caused a massive {{upheaval}} in people's lives as military mobilization engaged millions of men. Women were also {{accepted into the}} military in the U.S. Women's Army Corps (WACs) and U.S. Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer <b>Emergency</b> <b>Service</b> (WAVES). Unlike processes to screen out male homosexuals, which had been in place since the creation of the American military, there were no methods to identify or screen for lesbians; they were put into place gradually during World War II. Despite common attitudes regarding women's traditional roles in the 1930s, independent and masculine women were directly recruited by {{the military in the}} 1940s, and frailty discouraged.|$|E

5|$|Although the USCG officially {{opened its}} doors to African-American women in October 1944, {{it was not until}} March 1945 that the first five women were {{accepted}}; they were the only African-American women to serve in the SPARS. Although the Women's Army Corps (WAC) accepted African-American women from its inception, the U.S. Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer <b>Emergency</b> <b>Service</b> (WAVES) only began accepting African-American women in October 1944, with fewer than 100 of them serving in the WAVES, and the U.S. Marine Corps Women's Reserve never opened its ranks to African-American women.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Pre-hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>services</b> {{are one of}} {{the main}} {{determinants}} of the services outcome. Patients' satisfactions from these services lead to promoting their trust and finally improving the services quality. The aim {{of this study was to}} survey patients' satisfaction from pre-hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>services</b> in Tabriz. Material and Methods: In this cross sectional study, data were gathered using a validated questionnaire. Sampling was conducted among pre-hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>services</b> users in 2013 in Tabriz. Using Cochran formula, 1052 samples were selected through systematic random sampling method. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 21. Results: Among the pre-hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>services</b> users, 52. 8 % were men, most of them were married (62 %) and 74 % of the patients using pre-hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>services</b> were recovered. It was revealed that 69. 2 % of the participants were completely satisfied with <b>emergency</b> <b>services.</b> Patients' marital status and gender had no correlation with satisfaction level. Conclusion: Results showed an acceptable level of patients' satisfaction from pre-hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>services</b> in Tabriz. To maintain and improve the patients' satisfaction, its identified determinants in this study should be considered and appropriate policies need to be made to improve services quality...|$|R

Incident management teams were also established to help people in the wake of the storm. Additionally, urban search and rescue equipment was set up in Karratha. Horizon Power dispatched additional linemen to the most at-risk areas in Narelle's path to speed up power restoration in the wake of the storm. In Carnarvon, mango producers picked as much of their fruit as possible before the storm arrived to minimise losses.|$|E
5|$|Sector General is a {{gigantic}} multi-species hospital space station founded as a peace-promoting project by two heroes from {{opposite sides of}} humanity's first full interstellar war. The hospital accommodates patients and staff from dozens of species, with different environmental requirements, behaviors and ailments, {{but many of the}} stories feature types of patient that the builders did not anticipate. Initially most of the stories center round the career of Doctor Conway, who rises from junior surgeon to the top level, Senior Diagnostician. In the fourth book the Galactic Federation decides that the <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> which the hospital offers to victims of space accidents and planetary catastrophes is its most effective means of making peaceful contact with new spacefaring species, which allows the series to expand its range of plots, characters and locations.|$|E
