[...] Upon that the damsel raised her right hand with her glove in it, and she smote Sir Ewaine upon the face with the glove so that the mark of her glove lay upon his cheek. And Sir Ewaine made no defence against her assault, but ever he gazed very steadfastly at her, and he said very bitterly: [...] "Lady, if thou wert a knight, thou wouldst not dare to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> for either thou wouldst pay for that blow with thy life, or else I would wipe out the disgrace thereof with mine own blood." ...|$|E

It is hard to know sometimes what is right and what is wrong. What he told me to <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was right. Had he told me to go away and leave him, I should have gone,--and have died. I suppose that would have been right." [...] She paused as though she expected an answer. But the subject was so difficult that Mrs. Wortle was unable to make one. [...] "I have sometimes wished that he had done so. But as I think of it when I am alone, I feel how impossible that would have been to him. He could not have sent me away. That which you call right would have been impossible to him whom I regard as the most perfect of human beings. As far as I know him, he is faultless;--and yet, according to your judgment, he has committed a sin so deep that he must stand disgraced before the eyes of all men." ...|$|E

The sort of dog, you know, no one would take, or treat decently if they did. Bad habits of every kind, poor dear. I bought her because she was being starved. But she trusted me, that's why I feel so like a murderer. When the Vet and I were in the yard {{discussing}} her, she knew there was something wrong--she kept looking at my face. I very nearly went back on it; only, having got him out on purpose, I was ashamed to. We brought her down here, and on the way she found the remains of a rabbit about a week old--that was one of her accomplishments--bringing me the most fearful offal. She brought it up wagging her tail--as much as to say: 'See--I am some use!' The Vet tied her up here and took his gun; she wagged her tail at that, too; and I ran away. When the shot came, my own little spaniel fawned on me--they are uncanny--licked me all over, never was so gushing, seemed saying: 'What awful power you have! I do love you! You wouldn't <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> would you? We've got rid of that other one, though!' When I came back here to bury the poor thing, and saw her lying on her side so still, I made a real fool of myself. I was patting her an hour ago, talking to {{her as if she were}} a human being.

Hornblow asked Gable to call her, and he told her: [...] "I'm supposed to talk you into doing this thing. But I'm not going to. I hated it when they <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But I hope you change your mind, kid, I {{think it would be}} fun to work together." [...] The two remained friends for life.|$|R

5000|$|Gould {{later became}} more {{critical}} of his 1955 interpretation, expressing reservations about its fast tempi and pianistic affectation. He found much of it [...] "just too fast for comfort", and lamented the 25th variation, which sounded [...] "like a Chopin nocturne"—to Gould, an undesirable quality. He continued, [...] "I can no longer recognize the person who <b>did</b> <b>that.</b> <b>To</b> <b>me</b> today <b>that</b> piece has intensity without any sort of false glamour.

He admits to program director Andy Travis that it took time <b>to</b> develop <b>that</b> skill, saying of one client: [...] "He <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> pay up twenty times. Then I got smart." [...] Herb also repeats this skill in The New WKRP in Cincinnati, where he bails rookie salesman Arthur Carlson, Jr. out of a ticket trade scam for a freak show operator. Though the contract legally binds the station to air the show's ads, Herb is released from the contract after he threatens to take legal action against the promoter, who has habitually left a string of unpaid debts to other radio stations.|$|R

5000|$|Davies {{wakes up}} and {{complains}} to Aston about how badly he slept. He blames {{various aspects of the}} flat's set up. Aston suggests adjustments but Davies proves to be callous and inflexible. Aston tells the story of how he was checked into a mental hospital and given electric shock therapy, but when he tried to escape from the hospital he was shocked while standing, leaving him with permanent brain damage; he ends by saying, [...] "I've often thought of going back and trying to find the man who <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But I want to do something first. I want <b>to</b> build <b>that</b> shed out in the garden" [...] (54-57). Critics regard Aston's monologue, the longest of the play, as the [...] "climax" [...] of the plot.

5000|$|Philadelphia sports {{radio host}} Howard Eskin has used his talk show to blast Kenney and his {{authorization}} of the sugary drinks tax. In April 2017, Kenney appeared on Eskin's network, 94.1 WIP, to contend his claims {{and promote the}} 2017 NFL draft in Philly. Kenney attacked Eskin, saying, [...] "Here's what I don't understand about Eskin. First of all, he's in that prime spot of 8-10 a.m. on Saturday mornings...I mean like, it's like the show should be called 'The Sound of One Hand Clapping.' Cause no one hears it." [...] Kenney also jokingly {{said that he would}} handle things differently with Eskin if he weren’t mayor. “If we were regular people sitting at a bar and he was <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> there would be a consequence,” Kenney said. “But because I am an elected official, I can’t do it.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Richie is {{the only}} person in the series to have ever struck Fonzie without retaliation. In the episode [...] "Welcome Home: Part 2" [...] from Season 11, Fonzie finds Richie (who has just {{returned}} home from the Army) drowning his sorrows in a local bar after resigning himself to a job at the Milwaukee Journal rather than follow his dream to become a Hollywood screenwriter, largely to please his family. Richie punches Fonzie in the face after Fonzie tries to take him home, but puts Richie in a full nelson after Richie takes a swing at him a second time. [...] "What, you think you're gonna <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a second time?" [...] is what Fonzie says prior to pinning Richie to a pool table. They patch things up and Richie returns home and decides to go to California.|$|E
5000|$|With this film, Warner Bros. chief Jack L. Warner {{tried to}} change Bette Davis' screen persona by putting her in a {{platinum}} blonde wig and false eyelashes and dressing her in glamorous costumes. The actress, who {{had been trying to}} convince the studio head to loan her to RKO so she could portray slatternly waitress Mildred Rogers in Of Human Bondage, was appalled at the transformation, complaining they were trying to turn her into Greta Garbo. In an interview with Photoplay editor Kathryn Dougherty, she complained, [...] "I can't get out of these awful ruts. They just won't take me seriously. Look at me in this picture - all done up like a third-rate imitation of the MGM glamour queens. That isn't me. I'll never be a clothes horse or romantic symbol." [...] To Gerald Clarke of Time she lamented, [...] "I looked like somebody dressed up in mother's clothes. But it was a great break because I learned from the experience.

5000|$|Van Pelt is {{well liked}} {{by the rest}} of the team; Lisbon even lets Grace take the lead on one interview, despite the fact that she is still a rookie. She always refers to Lisbon as [...] "Boss" [...] or [...] "the boss", even when Teresa isn't around. In another episode, Grace is shot (while wearing a kevlar vest) and is taken to the hospital. Just before she gets into the ambulance, Lisbon is visibly upset and tells Grace sweetly: [...] "Don't you <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again", {{indicating}} her fondness of her. In the opening of season four, Lisbon addresses Grace as her friend while encouraging her to get help. Jane appears to have a fondness for Grace, much as she does for him; theirs appears to be rather like a sibling relationship, and Jane tends to favor her over Cho and Rigsby. It has been shown that Jane gets enjoyment from messing with Grace. He offers Grace more support than most people, but they tend to clash over spiritual issues such as the after-life. She seems to enjoy working with Cho; she is open with him and considers him a friend, although she doesn't always appreciate his straightforward manner.|$|E

5000|$|Paulin was {{a member}} of the Labour Party but {{resigned}} after declaring that the government of Tony Blair was [...] "a Zionist government". His poem [...] "Killed in Crossfire" [...] in the British newspaper The Observer aroused some controversy for referring to a Palestinian boy being [...] "gunned down by the Zionist SS". According to Denis MacShane in Globalising Hatred: The New Antisemitism (2008), it was Paulin's expression of his [...] "anger and anguish at the behaviour of Israeli troops". In an interview he gave to the state-owned Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram Weekly, Paulin described Israeli government actions in Palestine as [...] "an historical obscenity". When asked how he responds to accusations of anti-Semitism that follow such descriptions, he told the newspaper [...] "I just laugh when they <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It does not worry me at all. These are the Hampstead liberal Zionists. I have utter contempt for them. They use this card of anti-Semitism". Regarding supporters of Israel, Paulin stated [...] "You are either a Zionist or an anti-Zionist. Everyone who supports Israel is a Zionist". After his comments in Al-Ahram raised controversy, he said in a letter to The Independent and the Daily Telegraph, that his views were [...] "distorted", writing, [...] "I have been, and am, a lifelong opponent of anti-Semitism ... I do not support attacks on Israeli civilians under any circumstances. I am in favour of the current efforts to achieve a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians".|$|E
5000|$|... "I remain {{real good}} friends {{with most of the}} men in my life. [...] "Long Way To Go" [...] was not written in such a nice way. This {{happened}} to be an experience that I had with somebody that I did very much love, who... we had been broken up for a long time before, a year before, and I had just finished Rock a Little, and I had walked into my house with Rock a Little under my arm, an acetate... the phone rang, and it was him, and he wanted me to drive {{two and a half hours}} to wherever it was that he lived... and I was very tired, and it was very late, it was like 3:30, 4 in the morning, and I turned around to somebody that was living in my house at that time, and I said, 'should I go?' And they said, 'well, it's a pretty long way to go to say goodbye again. I thought that we'd already, basically... Stevie, it's taking you an awful long time to get over this. Do you want to go down and start it up again?' And so I went back and forth and back and forth in my mind, and finally he said to me 'I'm sending a limousine for you.' And I said alright. And so... chump that I was, I got in the car and drove down there and played the record for him, and he kept it. Which I will never forgive him for. He kept my first acetate. And I think the last thing that I did say to him was, 'you know, it's a real long way to go to say goodbye again. I thought we already did that. Have fun, tell the world.' Which basically means words we don't say over the radio. Goodbye. Forever this time. Don't ever call me again. I mean, he put me in the car, and I was hysterical in tears, and I cried all the way home, and I said, 'I will never, ever, ever put myself in that position again. Nobody will ever <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again. As much as I loved him, I will never let that happen again." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{thought that}} was the truth until they exposed what happened. I didn't find out the truth until the script came. They're like, [...] "You have to wait and see." [...] For a while I was like, [...] "Oh, my gosh! This is huge. He's not my dad." [...] I was getting really into it. Then I saw what happened. I was reading and they left like a cliff note right {{at the end of one}} of the scripts about what Sharon did. I was sitting in my {{dressing}} room in disbelief, like, [...] "How could she <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> This is awful. This is way bad." [...] I took it very close to heart.I'm actually really excited. I'm very curious as to how they're going to play it out with Summer. I'm sure she's still going to have the close bond that she now has with Jack. I'm excited to play it as an actress and to see how it all plays out as a fan. — Hunter King, on Summer's paternity test and Sharon switching the results. In a 2010 interview with TV Guide, Morrow openly discussed his strong belief that Summer was not Nick's child due to the fact that Nick was suffering from amnesia at the time. Though the actor himself questioned Summer's paternity, it seemed nothing would come of his speculation. In October 2012, Bushman hinted that she would not be opposed to a potential romance with Kyle Abbott (then Blake Hood). In February 2013, King's version of Summer is scripted as being 18 years old, and the character has developed a major crush on Kyle. Nick's immediate disapproval hinted that there was more to his disapproval then just the slight age difference between the two characters. Because Nick is the only person to see the test results, many viewers have begun to speculate that Jack could indeed be Summer's biological father. Summer's crush on Kyle reminds them of the possibility that they could be brother and sister. With the installation of Josh Griffith as head writer, in addition to Nick's adamant disapproval of Summer's crush on Kyle, Jack even brings up the night he helped deliver Summer in the elevator. According to Griffith, Nick is so protective because he knows about Jack's playboy history during his younger years. He stated: [...] "Nick's worried that Summer is going to get involved with someone who could break her heart." [...] Despite Griffith's explanation, King herself questioned Summer's paternity; [...] "I ask Josh everyday, 'Whose daughter am I?" [...] Though Griffith does not confirm or deny anything, he explained that anything is possible.|$|E
