5|$|The rush of {{technology}} and the commercialisation of agriculture {{in the second half}} of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks—many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets. There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines, and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians. There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for <b>internal</b> <b>consumption.</b> The railway network provided critical famine relief, notably reduced the cost of moving goods, and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.|$|E

25|$|As {{opposed to}} most antique rug manufactory practices, Chinese carpets were woven almost {{exclusively}} for <b>internal</b> <b>consumption.</b> China {{has a long}} history of exporting traditional goods; however, it was not until the first half of the 19th century that the Chinese began to export their rugs. Once in contact with western influences, there was a large change in production: Chinese manufactories began to produce art-deco rugs with commercial look and price point. The centuries-old Chinese textile industry is rich in history. While most antique carpets are classified according to a specific region or manufactory, scholars attribute the age of any specific Chinese rug to the ruling emperor of the time. The earliest surviving examples of the craft were produced during the time of Ch'ung Chen, the last emperor of the Chen Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Oaxaca {{is based on}} agriculture, {{especially}} {{in the interior of}} the state. Only 9% of the territory is suitable for agriculture due to the mountainous terrain, so there are limits to this sector. The production of food staples, such as corn and beans, is mostly for <b>internal</b> <b>consumption</b> but this production cannot meet demand. The total agricultural production of the state was estimated at 13.4million tons with a value of 10,528 million pesos in 2007. As of 2000, 1,207,738 hectares are used for the raising of crops, most of which occurs during the annual rainy season, with only 487,963 having crops growing year round. Only 81,197 hectares have irrigation. The variation of climate allows for a wider range of agricultural crops than would otherwise grow in a geographical region of this size. Oaxaca is the nation's second highest producer of grains and agave. It is third in the production of peanuts, mango and sugar cane. It is the second largest producer of goat meat, providing about 10% of the national total. In the more temperate areas crops such as corn, beans, sorghum, peanuts, alfalfa and wheat are grown. In more tropical areas, crops also include coffee, sesame seed, rice, sugar cane and pineapple.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} {{utilization}} of landfill biogas as a fuel for electrical power generation. Landfills {{can be regarded as}} conversion biogas plants to electricity, not only covering <b>internal</b> <b>consumptions</b> of the facility but contributing in the power grid as well. A landfill gas plant consists of a recovery and a production system. The recovery of landfill gas is an area of vital interest since it combines both alternative energy production and reduction of environmental impact through reduction of methane and carbon dioxide, two of the main greenhouse gases emissions. This study follows two main objectives. First, to determine whether active extraction of landfill gas in the examined municipal solid waste sites would produce adequate electric power for utilisation and grid connection and second, to estimate the reduction of sequential greenhouse gases emissions. However, in order to optimize the designing of a plant fed by biogas, it is necessary to quantify biogas production over several years. The investigation results of energy efficiency and environmental impact of biogas utilization in landfills are considering satisfactory enough both in electric energy production and in contribution to greenhouse gases mitigation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a novel {{process for}} producing hydrogen from natural gas, based on chemical looping (CL) techniques, allowing for intrinsic capture of carbon dioxide. The {{core of the}} process consists of a three-reactors CL system, where iron oxide particles are circulated to: (i) oxidize natural gas (thus providing, after cooling and water condensation, a CO 2 stream ready for sequestration), (ii) reduce steam, to produce hydrogen as the final product of the process, (iii) consume oxygen from an air stream, to sustain the thermal balance of the system. The process is intrinsically very attractive, because it directly produces hydrogen and CO 2 from natural gas, {{by means of a}} process simpler than the conventional technologies with CO 2 capture capabilities. Hence, a significant potential for investment cost reduction can be anticipated. However, to fully exploit the system potential, an efficient energy recovery from the gaseous streams exiting the reactors must be arranged, taking into account power and steam production needed to support <b>internal</b> <b>consumptions.</b> Therefore, after an introduction clarifying the concept and the scope of the system, as well as its basic chemistry, this paper presents a discussion of two plant configurations, including different integration levels with power production (fired gas turbine (GT) vs. unfired turbocharger) and/or heat recovery steam production methods (also considering steam compression devices). A comparison with ‘‘proven technology’’ plants, based on steam reforming, is also carried out. Due to the lack of reliable estimates of the investment costs for components to be developed from scratch (CL reactors), the analysis is limited to the thermodynamic and technological aspects. Results show, however, that an impressive potential exists for CL systems for hydrogen production, thus deserving substantial R&D activities in the near future...|$|R
