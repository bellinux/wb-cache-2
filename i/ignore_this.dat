25|$|The United States {{and other}} NATO states often <b>ignore</b> <b>this</b> {{sensitive}} issue, likely because of potential effects on their war strategy in Afghanistan. Their involvement could strain relations and jeopardise their own national {{interests in the}} area. This came after the November 2011 NATO bombing in which 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed. In response to that incident, Pakistan decided to cut off all NATO supply lines as well as boost border security by installing anti-aircraft guns and radars to monitor air activity. Regarding the Durand Line, some rival maps are said to display discrepancies {{of as much as}} five kilometers.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Stargate Universe, {{the last}} Stargate program on television, ended its run. Brad Wright {{announced}} {{that there were}} no more plans to continue the same story in further productions. In 2016, comic publisher American Mythology acquired the rights to publish new Stargate Atlantis stories set within the established franchise canon. This was expanded in 2017 to include new Stargate Universe comics as well, resolving the cliffhanger that ended the show. The predominant story arc thus ran on television for 15 years, including 17 seasons (354 episodes) of programming, and 8 comic book issues as of July 2017. However, a variety of other media either <b>ignore</b> <b>this</b> main continuity or resets it, while maintaining essential elements that define the franchise (mainly, the inclusion of a Stargate device). These include the 2002 animated series Stargate Infinity.|$|E

25|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the new series, Channel 5 {{launched}} a national advertising campaign to promote the show's return. These featured a series of contemporary adverts on television, as well as billboards. Other promotions included advertisements on taxi receipts, a social networking campaign and branded beer mats, all designed to attract the young male audience Channel 5 was targeting. The Sun reported that Richie banned Waterman from appearing in the series remake, but Richie told fans to <b>ignore</b> <b>this</b> story, saying it would be an honour to be in the company of Waterman and Cole, let alone work with them on television. On 31 May 2009, UK newspaper The Mirror reported that, due to alleged poor ratings, Channel 5 would not be commissioning a new series of Minder.|$|E
25|$|The {{cognitive}} mechanism {{involved in the}} Stroop task {{is referred to as}} directed attention. The Stroop task requires the participant to engage in and allows assessment of processes such as attention management, speed and accuracy of reading words and colours and of inhibition of competing stimuli. The stimulus is a colour word that is printed in a different colour than what the written word reads. For example, the word “red” is written in a blue font. One must verbally classify the colour that the word is displayed/printed in, while ignoring the information provided by the written word. In the aforementioned example, this would require the participant to say “blue” when presented with the stimulus. Although the majority of people will show some slowing when given incompatible text versus font colour, this is more severe in individuals with deficits in inhibition. The Stroop task takes advantage of the fact that most humans are so proficient at reading colour words that it is extremely difficult to <b>ignore</b> <b>this</b> information, and instead acknowledge, recognize and say the colour the word is printed in. The Stroop task is an assessment of attentional vitality and flexibility. More modern variations of the Stroop task tend to be more difficult and often try to limit the sensitivity of the test.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the years}} 1529 until 1543 the Muslim Adal Sultanate armies with the {{assistance}} of forces from the Ottoman Empire invaded and fought the Ethiopian Empire and came close to extinguishing the ancient realm of Ethiopia, and converting all of its subjects to Islam. During that time period the Jews made a pact with the Ethiopian Empire. The leaders of the Kingdom of Beta Israel changed their alliance during the war and began supporting the Muslim Adal Sultanate armies. However, the Adal Sultanate armies felt strong enough to <b>ignore</b> <b>this</b> offer of support and killed many of its members. As a result, the leaders of the Beta Israel kingdom turned to the Ethiopian empire and their allies, and continued the fight against them. They conquered different regions of the Jewish kingdom, severely damaged its economy and requested their assistance in winning back the regions lost to the Adal Sultanate. The forces of the Ethiopian empire did succeed eventually in conquering the Muslims and freed Ethiopia from Ahmed Gragn. Nevertheless, the Ethiopian Christian empire decided to declare war against the Jewish Kingdom, giving as their justification the Jewish leaders' change of positions during the Ethiopian–Adal War. With the assistance of Portuguese forces from the Order of the Jesuits, the Ethiopian empire under the rule of Emperor Gelawdewos invaded the Jewish kingdom and executed the Jewish king Joram. As a result of this battle, the areas of the kingdom became significantly smaller and included now only the region of the Semien Mountains.|$|E

25|$|Gene {{nomenclature}} {{and protein}} nomenclature are not separate endeavors; they are {{aspects of the}} same whole. Any name or symbol used for a protein can potentially {{also be used for}} the gene that encodes it, and vice versa. But owing to the nature of how science has developed (with knowledge being uncovered bit by bit over decades), proteins and their corresponding genes have not always been discovered simultaneously (and not always physiologically understood when discovered), which is the largest reason why protein and gene names do not always match, or why scientists tend to favor one symbol or name for the protein and another for the gene. Another reason {{is that many of the}} mechanisms of life are the same or very similar across species, genera, orders, and phyla, so that a given protein may be produced in many kinds of organisms; and thus scientists naturally often use the same symbol and name for a given protein in one species (for example, mice) as in another species (for example, humans). Regarding the first duality (same symbol and name for gene or protein), the context usually makes the sense clear to scientific readers, and the nomenclatural systems also provide for some specificity by using italic for a symbol when the gene is meant and plain (roman) for when the protein is meant. Regarding the second duality (a given protein is endogenous in many kinds of organisms), the nomenclatural systems also provide for at least human-versus-nonhuman specificity by using different capitalization, although scientists often <b>ignore</b> <b>this</b> distinction, given that it is often biologically irrelevant.|$|E

However, 8.a4 Bg7 {{is the most popular}} continuation, when White can aim for a transposition to the Classical Main Line with 9.e4. Another possibility is 9.h3 0-0 10.e3, which gives the bishop a retreat square in case of ...Nh5 and delays further expansion in the centre until the White's development is complete. Although a number of opening books recommended the 7.Bf4 variation for White in the early 21st century, Black appears to be able to maintain the balance in this line.|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{marks the}} return of American actress Megan Dodds, who first {{appeared}} {{in a handful of}} scenes in the first episode of the first series. The producers enjoyed the actress' company, and wanted her to return where the character would appear more often and developed throughout the second series. Jenny Agutter returns as Tessa Philips; it allows the audience to see what happens to her since her sacking in the first series finale. The episode introduces new regular character Ruth Evershed, played by Nicola Walker. The producers needed another [...] "interesting, strong" [...] member of the team following Tessa's departure. The character also came from GCHQ in the series; the producers were aware that the organisation employs 70,000 people, and the producers did not want to <b>ignore</b> <b>this</b> aspect of British intelligence gathering. Describing Walker's casting, producer Jane Featherstone recalled [...] "Nicola is extraordinary in it. I think she's completely brilliant. And she's developed that and I think once Nicola became that role that writers had just loved writing for that part, and she's really made it her own." [...] The character was created by Brenton. Her introduction depicted her as clumsy, mirroring the writer.|$|E

500|$|Attempting to {{reconcile}} these disparate positions, Eastern Orthodox theologian Dr. Mario Baghos notes that [...] "when taken {{at face value}} the saint seems to be contradicting himself in these passages; {{on the one hand}} he asserted the salvation of all and the complete eradication of evil, and, on the other, that the fire needed to purge evil is ‘sleepless’, i.e. everlasting. The only solution to this inconsistency is to view any allusion to universal salvation in St Gregory as an expression of God’s intention for humanity, which is in fact attested to when his holy sister states that God has “one goal [...] some straightway even in this life purified from evil, others healed hereafter through fire for the appropriate length of time.” That we can choose either to accept or <b>ignore</b> <b>this</b> purification is confirmed by the saint’s many exhortations that we freely undertake the virtuous path." [...] Dr. Ilaria Ramelli has made the observation that for Gregory free will was compatible with universal salvation, since every person would eventually accept the good having gone through purification. However, Gregory conceded that some sinners, such as Judas, might never be completely purified when he wrote, [...] "that which never existed is to be preferred to that which has existed in such sin. For, as to the latter, on account of the depth of the ingrained evil, the chastisement in the way of purgation will be extended into infinity".|$|E
