40|$|Abstract — Humans {{are able}} to process speech and other sounds {{effectively}} in adverse environments, hearing through noise, reverberation, and interference from other speakers. To <b>date,</b> <b>machines</b> {{have been unable to}} match human performance. One profound difference between biological and engineering systems comes at the input stage. In machines, an acoustic signal is typically chopped into short equally spaced segments in time. In biological systems, the cochlea outputs asynchronous spikes that respond in real-time to acoustic inputs. In this paper we describe a spiking cochlea implementation and recent experiments in both speaker and speech recognition that use spikes as input...|$|R

30|$|Analysing the usages of {{attributes}} {{included in}} the evolved scheduling heuristics has also {{been done in the}} literature to understand the contributions of these attributes. For example, Nguyen et al. [89] analyses the frequency usage of attributes in the final dispatching rules evolved by GP to show what are the most useful attributes. Branke et al. [18] analysed the importance of each attribute by measuring the performance of the best rules when certain attributes are not available. Their analyses show that some attributes are more important for specific representations. Instead of independently investigating each attribute, Hunt et al. [55] performed fragment analyses to show the most common fragments (with the depth of two) in the evolved scheduling heuristics. The analyses show that some fragments representing the differences between due <b>date,</b> <b>machine</b> ready time, and current time appear most often in the evolved heuristics. The analyses also showed that most frequent fragments from different GP techniques can be different.|$|R
40|$|Most {{artificial}} intelligence systems today work on simple problems and artificial domains because {{they rely on}} the accurate sensing of the task world. Object recognition is {{a crucial part of}} the sensing challenge and machine learning stands in a position to catapult object recognition into real world domains. Given that, to <b>date,</b> <b>machine</b> learning has not delivered general object recognition, we propose a different point of attack: the learning architectures themselves. We have developed a method for directly learning and combining algorithms in a new way that imposes little burden on or bias from the humans involved. This learning architecture, PADO, and the new results it brings to the problem of natural image object recognition is the focus of this chapter. 1. Introduction In general, AI systems use symbols to represent knowledge and to reason about tasks. Most of these systems today still work on simple problems and artificial domains. One of the main reasons for this is the common [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Fixtures form an {{important}} factor in traditional and modern flexible manufacturing systems, since fixture design directly affects manufacturing quality and productivity. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate quality of fixture design. The fixturing accessibility refers to machining feature accessibility and loading /unloading accessibility. The development of Computer Aided Fixture Design (CAFD) has simplified this task. Fixture design activities include setup planning, fixture planning and fixture configuration design. Fixture design verification comes next. Fixturing accessibility using Computer Aided Fixture Design is part of the verification process and has not received much attention till <b>date.</b> <b>Machining</b> feature accessibility analysis involves the evaluation of possible interference between fixture components and the cutting tool, which moves with pre-programmed tool path, while the loading and unloading accessibility relates to the ease with which the operator attaches/detaches the workpiece from the surrounding manufacturing environment. This research has three main focuses. The first focus is to evaluate machining featur...|$|R
