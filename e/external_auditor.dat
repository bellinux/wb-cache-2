25|$|Corporate {{governance}} {{mechanisms and}} controls {{are designed to}} reduce the inefficiencies that arise from moral hazard and adverse selection. There are both internal monitoring systems and external monitoring systems. Internal monitoring can be done, for example, by one (or a few) large shareholder(s) {{in the case of}} privately held companies or a firm belonging to a business group. Furthermore, the various board mechanisms provide for internal monitoring. External monitoring of managers' behavior, occurs when an independent third party (e.g. the <b>external</b> <b>auditor)</b> attests the accuracy of information provided by management to investors. Stock analysts and debt holders may also conduct such external monitoring. An ideal monitoring and control system should regulate both motivation and ability, while providing incentive alignment toward corporate goals and objectives. Care should be taken that incentives are not so strong that some individuals are tempted to cross lines of ethical behavior, for example by manipulating revenue and profit figures to drive the share price of the company up.|$|E
40|$|A recent {{response}} to the financial crisis has been to reinvigorate the use of <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> in financial regulation. The U. K. Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority are to use <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> in a more systematic way than {{was the case with}} the Financial Services Authority. The use of <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> is not new. This paper evaluates the U. K. experience and international use of <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> in bank supervision. It suggests the current U. K. approach does not go far enough in explaining how <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> in bank supervision will be used, and this could lead to a possible expectations gap in banking supervision. This is suggested to be the case in light of the limited levels of accountability and oversight over the auditing profession. To overcome the expectations gap, the paper proposes some further ideas from the international experience of using <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> in order to improve the way we use <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> and manage the different roles and interests such auditors have in a twin private and public role. It is suggested those ideas and proposals would go some way to improve how <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> are used in bank supervision: to better coordinate intense judgment-based supervision between the regulator-bloodhound and the auditor-watchdog. The paper argues that the level of reliance on third parties, such as <b>external</b> <b>auditors,</b> to undertake regulatory and supervisory tasks needs to be worked out in advance to efficiently allocate regulatory resources rather than leaving it in an ad hoc manner...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} internal and <b>external</b> <b>auditors,</b> with particular emphasis on the co-operation between internal and <b>external</b> <b>auditors,</b> and the reliance of <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> on the internal audit work, in local authorities. Previous studies indicate that some work has been undertaken to determine the factors that affecting external auditors' reliance on internal auditors' work. However, studies {{on the relationship between}} internal and <b>external</b> <b>auditors,</b> in terms of their co-operation,. and the impact of such a relationship on the external audit fees are still limited. In addition, all of the previous studies were conducted in the private sector context and so far nothing is known about the relationship between internal and <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> in the public sector. Thus, the aim {{of this study is to}} fill this g p by examining the relationship between two corporate governance mechanisms, namely, internal audit and external audit, and the factors that affect external auditors' reliance on internal auditors' work in two different countries, England and Malaysia. A mixed method approach, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, has been adopted in this study. Two different surveys of internal and <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> concerned with their perceptions of the relationship between internal and <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> were carried out in England and Malaysia. A total of 387 questionnaires were mailed to the Heads of Internal Audit in each of the English local authorities. Another 142 questionnaires were mailed to all the appointed auditors of the local authorities. Similarly, two different questionnaires were used for the Malaysian data collection. A total of 28 questionnaires were mailed to the Head of the Internal Audit Department and another 11 questionnaires were sent to the Directors of National Audit Department (<b>external</b> <b>auditors)</b> of local authorities. The survey findings indicate that the internal and <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> in Malaysia perceived that they have a moderate level of co-operation between them, while the internal and <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> in England perceived their level of co-operation as high. The <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> in England were able to place reliance on the internal audit work. However, in Malaysia there was no reliance on internal. auditors' work by the <b>external</b> <b>auditors,</b> because the internal auditors did not perform work relevant to financial statement audits. The size of the internal audit department, the internal auditors' knowledge of the local authority, and top management support of the internal auditors' work were the significant factors perceived by the internal and <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> of local authorities in England as affecting the level of external auditors' reliance on internal auditors' work. This study contributes to the extant literature by providing evidence using primary data from English and Malaysian local authorities. From a practical perspective this study could provide feedback to the relevant government departments and audit bodies on the need for policies that support and enhance the relationship between internal and <b>external</b> <b>auditors.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Financial reporting fraud is a concern for investors, regulators, <b>external</b> <b>auditors,</b> and the public. Although the responsibility for fraud detection lies upon management and those charged with governance, <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> are likely to come under scrutiny if fraud scandals come to light. Despite the audit regulators efforts in fighting fraud, evidence from prior literature revealed that <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> still need guidance in assessing and responding to fraud risks. Hence the current study aims at helping <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> properly assess {{and respond to the}} risk of financial reporting fraud in an effort to increase the likelihood of detecting it. In order to achieve this, the current study sought to explore the significance of various fraud factors in assessing the risks of financial reporting fraud and examined how <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> could assess these fraud factors. The current study also explored the likely motivations behind management fraud, the impact of management motivations on the financial statements, and how <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> could assess the impact of management motivations. The data for the current study was collected from <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> working at various audit firms in Egypt via the use of mixed research methods, namely through an online questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The findings of the current study revealed that management motives are the most significant factor in assessing the risk of financial reporting fraud. Hence the current study suggests that external audit should be viewed in terms of management motivations rather than just the audit of financial statements figures and disclosures. The current study offers detailed guidance to <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> in this area. The findings of the current study also revealed that management integrity is a significant factor in assessing the risk of financial reporting fraud and that rationalisation of fraud should be assessed as part of management integrity rather than a separate fraud risk factor. The current study found that fraud perpetrators capabilities are equally significant to the opportunity to commit fraud factor yet it is currently ignored by the audit standards and thus should be assessed as part of opportunity to commit fraud. The current study was the first to explore financial reporting fraud and the extent by which <b>external</b> <b>auditors</b> comply with ISA 240 in the Egyptian context. The current study offered recommendations to <b>external</b> <b>auditors,</b> audit firms, audit regulators, and the Egyptian government on how to combat financial reporting fraud.
