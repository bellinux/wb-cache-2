6000|$|I {{certainly}} {{intended to}} go without breakfast, and still remember how strongly I had that resolution in my mind. But there was that hour to wait. A beautiful August morning--I am very hungry. There is Rasherwell [...] "tucking" [...] away in the coffee-room. I pace the street, as sadly almost as if I had been coming to school, not going thence. I turn into a court by mere chance--I vow it was by mere chance--and there I see a coffee-shop with a placard in the window, Coffee, Twopence. Round of buttered toast, Twopence. And here am <b>I,</b> <b>hungry,</b> penniless, with five-and-twenty shillings of my parents' money in my pocket.|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} to feed {{is a complex}} task that requires several small independent choices. Am <b>I</b> <b>hungry?</b> Where do I look for food? Is there something better I’d rather be doing? When should I stop? With all of these questions, {{it is no wonder}} that decisions about feeding depend on several sensory modalities and that the influences of these sensory systems would be evident throughout the nervous system. The leech is uniquely well suited for studying these complicated questions due to its relatively simple nervous system, its exceptionally well-characterized behaviors and neural circuits, and the ease with which one can perform semi-intact preparations to study the link between physiology and decision-making. We will begin this review by discussing the cellular substrates that govern the {{decision to}} initiate and to terminate a bout of feeding. We will then discuss how feeding temporarily blocks competing behaviors from being expressed while the animal continues to feed. Then we will review what is currently known about how feeding affects long-term behavioral choices of the leech. Finally, we conclude with a short discussion of the advantages of the leech’s decision-making circuit’s design and how this design might be applicable to all decision circuits...|$|E

50|$|This {{indicates}} {{fragmentation of}} the psyche, the different feelings and thoughts of ‘I’ in a person: I think, I want, I know best, I prefer, I am happy, <b>I</b> am <b>hungry,</b> <b>I</b> am tired, etc. These {{have nothing in common}} with one another and are unaware of each other, arising and vanishing for short periods of time. Hence man usually has no unity in himself, wanting one thing now and another, perhaps contradictory, thing later.|$|R
