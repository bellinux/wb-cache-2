50|$|SCSI-3 devices with SCA-2 {{connectors}} {{are designed}} for <b>hot</b> <b>swapping.</b> Many server and RAID systems provide hardware support for transparent <b>hot</b> <b>swapping.</b> The designers of the SCSI standard prior to SCA-2 connectors did not target <b>hot</b> <b>swapping,</b> but in practice, most RAID implementations support <b>hot</b> <b>swapping</b> of hard disks.|$|R
50|$|Simple {{and cheap}} {{approach}} to <b>hot</b> <b>swapping.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>swapping</b> {{can also}} {{refer to the}} ability to alter the running code of a program without needing to {{interrupt}} its execution. Interactive programming is a programming paradigm that makes extensive use of <b>hot</b> <b>swapping,</b> so the programming activity becomes part of the program flow itself.|$|R
5000|$|Expansion memory : 1GB Memory Stick PRO Duo provided, (capable {{of up to}} 4 GB), also {{supports}} <b>Hot</b> <b>Swap</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Option for two <b>hot</b> <b>swap</b> SAS 2.5" [...] drives or Solid State drives (RAID 0 and 1 are possible) ...|$|E
5000|$|... 30 MB {{internal}} dynamic memory, microSD {{memory card}} slot with <b>hot</b> <b>swap,</b> max. 2 GB (tests reveal that 8 GB and even 16 GB microSD cards works fine if you have firmware v10.45 or newer).|$|E
50|$|Unlike PATA, both SATA and eSATA support <b>hot</b> <b>swapping</b> by design. However, {{this feature}} {{requires}} proper support at the host, device (drive), and operating-system levels. In general, all SATA devices (drives) support <b>hot</b> <b>swapping</b> (due {{to the requirements}} on the device-side), also most SATA host adapters support this command.|$|R
25|$|SPI {{does not}} support <b>hot</b> <b>swapping</b> (dynamically adding nodes).|$|R

50|$|Earlier GLFS {{models have}} been criticised for being {{incompatible}} with 3.5-inch SATA <b>hot</b> <b>swap</b> bays due {{to the position of}} the connectors; however, a new revision (HLFS models) has been released which remedies this problem. Furthermore, TLER has been enabled by default on HLFS models.|$|E
50|$|The {{multiplayer}} {{options include}} Infrastructure, Ad Hoc, <b>Hot</b> <b>Swap,</b> and a unique feature called Transmission mode, which is somewhat {{similar to the}} play by email system of older PC games. While playing in Transmission mode each player takes turns and sends them off to the server.|$|E
50|$|The RS210 was {{announced}} by Lenovo in September 2009, {{along with the}} TS200. It was a rack server with specifications {{similar to those of}} the TS200. The processor, chipset, and RAM were the same. However, the four available <b>hot</b> <b>swap</b> bays were designed for 2.5 inch hard disk drives.|$|E
50|$|Only a few {{programming}} languages support <b>hot</b> <b>swapping</b> natively, including Pike, Lisp, Erlang, Smalltalk, Visual Basic 6 (Not VB.net), Java {{and most}} recently Elm and Elixir. Microsoft Visual Studio supports a kind of <b>hot</b> <b>swapping</b> called Edit and Continue, which is supported by C#, VB.NET and C/C++ when running under a debugger.|$|R
25|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>swapping,</b> where code can {{be changed}} without {{stopping}} a system.|$|R
50|$|A similar concept, <b>hot</b> <b>swapping,</b> {{refers to}} {{on-the-fly}} replacement of computer hardware.|$|R
50|$|CompactPCI was {{initially}} ratified as PICMG 2.0 in late 1995 as a passive backplane for PCI signaling. The 2.x series of specifications from PICMG {{provide support for}} a variety of technologies including <b>Hot</b> <b>Swap</b> (PICMG 2.1), Telephony signaling (PICMG 2.5) and most notably the expansion of the architecture to include switched Ethernet (PICMG 2.16).|$|E
50|$|More complex {{implementations}} may recommend but do {{not require}} that the component be shut down, with sufficient redundancy in the system to allow operation to continue if a component is removed without being shut down. In these systems <b>hot</b> <b>swap</b> is normally used for regular maintenance to the computer, or to replace a broken component.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to design chips to be resistant to latch-up by adding a layer of insulating oxide (called a trench) that surrounds both the NMOS and the PMOS transistors. This breaks the parasitic SCR structure between these transistors. Such parts are important in the cases where the proper sequencing of power and signals cannot be guaranteed, such as <b>hot</b> <b>swap</b> devices.|$|E
5000|$|All modules can be {{inserted}} or removed on a running enclosure (<b>Hot</b> <b>swapping)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|These can be {{selected}} by the SATA AHCI driver, usually via a configuration option. <b>Hot</b> <b>swapping</b> is disabled.|$|R
50|$|If {{they are}} <b>hot</b> <b>swapped,</b> the devices must be similar {{enough that the}} driver running on the host system recognizes, {{and can be used}} with, the new device. Otherwise, the new device will not {{function}} properly. While this is seldom an issue with standard keyboard devices, the host system rarely recognizes the new device attached to the PS/2 mouse port. In practice most keyboards can be <b>hot</b> <b>swapped</b> but this should be avoided.|$|R
50|$|Another {{goal of the}} K42 {{design is}} to achieve a {{customizable}} and maintainable system. Being built with an object-oriented design, it allows applications to customize and thus optimize the OS services required, {{and then on the}} fly <b>hot</b> <b>swap</b> kernel object implementations. This is particularly important for applications, such as databases and web servers, where the ability to control physical resources can improve performance.|$|E
50|$|RapidIO {{supports}} high availability, {{fault tolerant}} system design, including <b>hot</b> <b>swap.</b> The error conditions that require detection, and standard registers to communicate status and error information, are defined. A configurable isolation mechanism is also defined so that {{when it is not}} possible to exchange packets on a link, packets can be discarded to avoid congestion and enable diagnosis and recovery activities. In-band (port-write packet) and out-of-band (interrupt) notification mechanisms are defined.|$|E
50|$|The server {{supported}} {{up to six}} 3.5 inch SATA or SAS <b>hot</b> <b>swap</b> {{hard disk}} drives. Upgrades to the server included conversion options to eight 2.5 inch hard disk drives or four 3.5 inch hard disk drives with an internal tape drive with external storage arrays. Power consumption was recorded as being 45W on standby, 203W with the OS on idle, and 289W with the processor’s capabilities tested intensively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>swapping</b> also {{facilitates}} developing systems {{where large}} amounts of data are being processed, as in entire genomes in bioinformatics algorithms.|$|R
5000|$|Managing large {{hard disk}} farms by {{allowing}} disks {{to be added}} and replaced without downtime or service disruption, in combination with <b>hot</b> <b>swapping.</b>|$|R
50|$|PS/2 ports are {{designed}} to connect the digital I/O lines of the microcontroller in the external device directly to the digital lines of the microcontroller on the motherboard. They are not designed to be <b>hot</b> swappable. <b>Hot</b> <b>swapping</b> PS/2 devices usually does not cause damage because more modern microcontrollers {{tend to have more}} robust I/O lines built into them which are harder to damage than those of older controllers; however, <b>hot</b> <b>swapping</b> can still potentially cause damage on older machines, or machines with less robust port implementations.|$|R
50|$|The Surface Pro 3 {{is built}} on the 4th {{generation}} Intel Core processor with TPM chip for enterprise security. It includes a USB 3.0 port and a Mini DisplayPort on the right, an audio jack on the left, and a <b>hot</b> <b>swap</b> microSD slot {{on the back of}} the device. The microSD slot supports memory cards up to 200 GB. The internal solid-state drive and system memory are not user upgradeable.|$|E
50|$|A legacy port is a {{computer}} port or connector that is considered {{by some to be}} fully or partially superseded. The replacement ports usually provide most of the functionality of the legacy ports with higher speeds, more compact design, or plug and play and <b>hot</b> <b>swap</b> capabilities for greater ease of use. Modern PC motherboards use separate Super I/O controllers to provide legacy ports since current chipsets do not offer direct support for them. A category of computers called legacy-free PCs omits these ports, typically retaining only USB for external expansion.|$|E
50|$|Techpowerup, quoting Lenovo's press release, stated, “The all-new, highly {{scalable}} ThinkServer TS430 sets {{a new standard}} in its class with options for an enormous 16 TB of <b>hot</b> <b>swap</b> storage capacity, powerful SAS RAID data protection and redundant power choices for peace of mind. It suits demanding environments requiring high capacity, high performance and 24x7 uptime.” The press release also indicated that the TS430 was “rack-able” and offered features like hard disk drive access {{from the front of}} the server, as well as the ThinkServer Management Module with iKVM.|$|E
5000|$|Uninterrupted change out of servers. Directs workloads {{away from}} a failed server, but it enables the <b>hot</b> <b>swapping</b> of {{hardware}} without interruption to the operation of an application.|$|R
5000|$|Low Power {{with two}} {{internal}} states Partial and Slumber. Partial has a maximum return latency of 10 microseconds while slumber has a maximum latency of 10 milliseconds. <b>Hot</b> <b>swapping</b> is disabled.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>swapping</b> and <b>hot</b> {{plugging}} is replacing or adding components {{without stopping}} or {{shutting down the}} system. More specifically, <b>hot</b> <b>swapping</b> describes replacing components without interruption to the system, while hot plugging describes the addition of components that would expand the system without significant interruption to {{the operation of the}} system. Once the appropriate software is installed on the computer, a user can plug and unplug the component without rebooting. A well-known example of this functionality is the Universal Serial Bus (USB) that allows users to add or remove peripheral components such as a mouse, keyboard, or printer.|$|R
