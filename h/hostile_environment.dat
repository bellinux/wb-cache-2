5|$|Although {{myths and}} {{speculation}} about a Terra Australis ("Southern Land") {{date back to}} antiquity, Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered and colonised by humans, unsighted until 1820 when the Russian expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on Vostok and Mirny sighted the Fimbul ice shelf. The continent, however, remained largely neglected {{for the rest of}} the 19th century because of its <b>hostile</b> <b>environment,</b> lack of easily accessible resources, and isolation.

5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather near Panama {{drifted to}} a location south of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca, and organized into Tropical Depression Four-E on July 9. It moved westward through a <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> of strong shear. The wind shear disrupted the cyclone's convection and weakened its circulation. Despite the shear, the depression strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} early on July 12 and was named Cristina. This broke down the steering ridge, and Cristina turned {{to the north and}} peaked on July 14. Then, the wind shear won out and Cristina quickly weakened. Cristina dissipated into a swirl of clouds on July 16, without ever threatening land. No impact was reported.|$|E
5|$|Edward VI acceded to the English throne in 1547, and the Protestant reformers there {{hoped to}} take the {{opportunity}} to more thoroughly reform the Church of England. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer invited Vermigli and Ochino to assist in the effort. In addition, the victory of Catholic Emperor Charles V in the Schmalkaldic War and the resulting Augsburg Interim led to a <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> for Protestants in Germany. Vermigli accepted the invitation in November and sailed with Ochino to England. In 1548, he replaced Richard Smyth, becoming the second Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. This was a very influential post at a university which had been slow to accept reform.|$|E

When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.|$|E
5|$|On August24, Marie {{developed}} an eye and rapidly intensified to a Category5 hurricane with winds of 160mph (260km/h). At its peak, the hurricane's gale-force winds spanned an area 575mi (925km) across. Marie subsequently underwent an eyewall replacement cycle on August25 which prompted steady weakening. Over {{the next several}} days, Marie progressively degraded to below hurricane strength as it moved into an increasingly <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> with cooler waters and a more stable atmosphere. On August29, after having lost all signs of organized deep convection, Marie degenerated into a remnant low. The large system gradually wound down over the following several days, with winds subsiding below gale-force on August30. The remnant cyclone eventually lost a well defined center and dissipated on September2 about 1,200mi (1,950km) northeast of Hawaii.|$|E

We focus on knowledge sharing {{as it relates}} to individual behavior and management as guiding basically willing individuals. We elaborate the dimensions related to knowledge hoarding, apprehension about failures, and the Not-Invented-Here syndrome by investigating their features in knowledge-sharing <b>hostile</b> <b>environments.</b> Empirically, we explore a context not widely covered by the Western management literature on knowledge sharing: we draw on the examples of six Russian companies, three with and three without Western ownership. In terms of action orientation, we suggest that in knowledge-sharing <b>hostile</b> <b>environments</b> management needs initially to force knowledge sharing in order to transform the hostility into a knowledge embracing culture. We outline concrete guidelines of how to overcome the specific barriers to knowledge sharing.

5|$|On September 13, {{despite being}} in an {{extremely}} <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> with very high wind shear, convection redeveloped {{near the center of}} Fred, and regeneration into a tropical cyclone was seen as a possibility. Two days later, the NHC noted that environmental conditions could become marginally favorable for redevelopment of the system. On September16, the circulation of Fred became less defined and only intermittent convection persisted around the system. By September17, the remnant circulation became increasingly disorganized and the system dissipated later that day without regenerating into a tropical cyclone. However, several hours later, a new area of low pressure formed in association with the remnants of Fred roughly 525mi (845km) south of Bermuda. The remnant low finally dissipated on September19, roughly 520mi (835km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|Thinly populated, {{far from}} the colonial capital of Rio de Janeiro (which {{exercised}} little actual control), Rio Grande do Sul was often the target of invasions from its neighboring Hispanic-American colony, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (later Argentina). Because the captaincy had to be self-sufficient, the inhabitants of Rio Grande do Sul led lives as merchants, farmers or ranchers, while often also serving as soldiers or militiamen. Owners of large landholdings such as Marques de Sousa's father and grandfather provided food, equipment and protection for themselves and families living in areas under their control. Their private defense forces consisted primarily of laborers who were drafted as soldiers. Marques de Sousa grew up in that <b>hostile</b> <b>environment,</b> and from {{a very young age}} he listened to war stories recounting the exploits of his relatives against Hispanic-American invaders.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Delia {{originated}} from a tropical wave that formed over the central Caribbean Sea in late August 1973. Tracking towards the west-northwest, convective activity increased {{and the overall}} structure of the system improved. By August31, a weak {{area of low pressure}} formed over the Gulf of Honduras. This system tracked northward and further organized into a tropical depression just off the southeastern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula on September1. Gradually intensifying, the depression became a tropical storm on September3 as it turned towards the west. In accordance with its upgrade, it was given the name Delia. This upgrade followed a reconnaissance mission into the system that found sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h). A complex steering pattern formed later that day, resulting in a more <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> for the cyclone.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s, Mexico {{underwent}} {{a period of}} instability under the Plutarco Elías Calles administration who was seeking to limit {{the influence of the}} Catholic Church to modernize and centralize the state within the religious sphere of Mexican society. To protest the policies, the Catholic Church suspended all religious services, bringing about an uprising in Mexico. This uprising, or Cristero War, lasted from 1926 to 1929 and reemerged in the 1930s. On April 6, 1926 González had a vision in which God changed his name from Eusebio to Aarón and was later told to leave Monterrey where he and his wife served Saulo and Silas. On his journey, he preached near the entrances of Catholic churchesoften facing religious persecutionuntil he arrived at Guadalajara on December 12, 1926. The Cristero Wars impacted both Catholic and non-Catholic congregations and preachers, especially evangelical movements. Small movements were attacked by the government and the Cristeros, resulting in a <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> for González's work.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} morning of June25, Celia started rapidly {{weakening}} {{as it began}} {{to take a more}} northwesterly track into a more <b>hostile</b> <b>environment,</b> with cooler water temperatures and higher wind shear; all of these conditions are highly unfavorable for tropical cyclones. By June26, convection associated with the hurricane had substantially lessened and cloud tops warmed.

Traversing water temperatures estimated at , Celia continued to degenerate as it weakened to tropical storm status, by which time it was situated about 955mi (1,535km) southeast of the southern tip of Baja California Sur. Most of the convection associated with the system had dissipated and the center of circulation became exposed, with a small area of showers and thunderstorms to the north. Throughout June27, the system gradually lost its forward momentum over the open water of the Pacific Ocean but managed to maintain minimal tropical storm status longer than initially anticipated.|$|E
