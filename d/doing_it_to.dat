5|$|Beata {{reveals that}} {{they are aware of}} four male {{survivors}} of the Odin who have caused disruption in their society, and are considered fugitives. Beata requests Riker stay with her (and later requests that he order Troi, Data, and Yar to track down the survivors' camp and their leader Ramsey (Sam Hennings), while staying and dining with her). After some back and forth, Data concludes Ramsey and the survivors of the Odin would have platinum with them, and Angel One is naturally devoid of platinum, allowing the Enterprise to easily detect them. Meanwhile, Riker dresses in the garb given to him for his dinner with Beata, Troi and Yar taunt him for dressing in clothes that sexualize him and in some ways demean him, and he is only <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> win favor with Beata. He responds by saying he is honoring the local customs, and acknowledges Beata's beauty, and that the garb is rather comfortable.|$|E
5|$|When he returns, Moody {{takes him}} to his office, and reveals himself to be Voldemort's 'faithful servant'; {{he was the one}} who put Harry's name into the Goblet of Fire, and has been guiding him through the tournament from behind the scenes to ensure that he would grab the Portkey first. Before Moody can kill Harry, Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape intervene. They learn that Moody is in fact Barty Crouch Jr., Mr. Crouch's son, {{disguised}} by Polyjuice Potion. Crouch had sentenced Crouch Jr. to life imprisonment in Azkaban over alleged ties to the Death Eaters but smuggled him out as a last favour to his dying wife. Crouch Jr. was the one who set off the Dark Mark at the Quidditch World Cup, <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> scare the Death Eaters he felt had abandoned Voldemort. Eventually, Voldemort had gotten in contact with Crouch Jr. and had him impersonate Moody as part of his plan. Crouch Jr. also admits to killing Crouch Sr., to prevent him telling Dumbledore about Voldemort. The real Moody is found inside Crouch Jr.'s enchanted trunk and rescued. Harry is then declared the winner of the Triwizard Tournament and given his winnings.|$|E

Based on Bowlby, the caregiving system {{is seen as}} a biobehavioral system in adults that is complementary to the child's attachment system. Not all foster carers have this strong biological disposition as many fear becoming too 'attached' and suffering loss, many are effectively <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> earn money and some perceive such children as 'damaged goods' and may remain emotionally distant and under involved.|$|E

25|$|Square dancers {{dance to}} a variety of music, mostly Chinese popular songs, both {{contemporary}} and historic. The hobby began in the mid-1990s, as middle-aged women who had been forced into retirement began <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> keep themselves occupied. Its popularity notwithstanding, square dancing {{has been the subject of}} considerable controversy in the 2010s China due to complaints of noise pollution in the evening or morning hours. Dancers in China's increasingly populous cities congregate in public areas because there are few dedicated facilities where they could go. Residents of nearby apartment complexes who have been disturbed by the high volume of multiple dance groups' musical accompaniment, especially late in the evening and early in the morning when they are trying to sleep, have sometimes reacted violently.|$|E

According to Richard Harris, a {{psychology}} professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others.

Many of his critics claimed he was <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and I wish you would give him credit because he did a very good job. It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E

She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red.
