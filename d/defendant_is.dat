5|$|While a <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> {{entitled}} to a fair cross section in the venire, the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> not guaranteed a fair cross section in the actual grand jury or petit jury. Yet, the equal protection clause does regulate the use of peremptory challenges {{in the selection of}} the petit jury from the venire. In the landmark case of Batson v. Kentucky (1986), the Supreme Court reversed a criminal conviction because of the prosecutor's racially motivated use of peremptory challenges.|$|E
5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> expected to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits the {{striking}} of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The race of the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E
5000|$|Evidence {{against the}} <b>defendants</b> <b>was</b> mainly circumstantial. Nonetheless, twenty-four of the twenty-six <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{sentenced to death}} by hanging on 18 January 1911, and the {{remaining}} two <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> sentenced to 8 years and 11 years respectively for violation of explosives ordinances.|$|R
50|$|In November-December 1915, most <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{released}} from custody on bail. A trial {{took place on}} 1 April 1916 and the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> acquitted.|$|R
50|$|Gender {{discrimination}} {{also helps}} explain the differences between trial outcomes in which some female <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> sentenced to death and other female <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> sentenced to lesser punishments. Phillip Barron argues that female <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to be}} sentenced to death for crimes that violate gender norms, such as killing children or killing strangers.|$|R
5|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss a criminal charge {{on the ground}} that he or she has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim, the defendant must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. The <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> not entitled to a presumption of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.|$|E
5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{authorized}} {{and actual}} sentence, upon demand, a criminal defendant {{has a right}} to trial by jury. The defendant does not have a right, conversely, to a bench trial without the consent of the prosecution. If the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> charged with crimes for which the authorized sentence exceeds six months, whether in state or federal court, the defendant {{has a right to}} a jury. Further, the defendant has a right to a trial by jury if the actual sentence exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence (e.g. contempt of court).|$|E
50|$|On December 7, five <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{given the}} death sentence, which was {{commuted}} to long prison terms, while other <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> sentenced to different terms in prison.|$|R
50|$|A {{federal grand}} jury in Baltimore has charged 22 {{defendants}} with conspiracy {{to participate in a}} violent racketeering enterprise. All but one <b>defendant</b> <b>are</b> also charged with conspiring to distribute drugs. The indictment was returned on October 6, 2011 and unsealed upon the arrests of seven defendants and the execution of seven search warrants. Eleven <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> previously in custody and four <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> still at large.|$|R
50|$|In Smith v Hughes (1960), the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> charged {{under the}} Street Offences Act 1959 {{which made it}} an offence to solicit {{prostitution}} in a public place. The <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> soliciting from within private premises (windows or on balconies) {{so they could be}} seen by the public without entering into the streets. The court applied the mischief rule holding that the activities of the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> within the mischief of the Act, and soliciting from within a house, is soliciting and molesting of the public. Therefore it is the same as if the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> outside on the street.|$|R
5|$|If a <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> convicted, {{the usual}} remedy for a {{violation}} {{of one of these}} provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E
5|$|Non-aggravated {{offences}} involving damage {{valued at}} less than £5,000 are triable only summarily by magistrates and the maximum sentence is three months' imprisonment and a fine of £2,500. If {{the value of the}} property damaged exceeds £5,000, the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> entitled to claim trial on indictment by a jury, but if tried summarily, may be sentenced to up to six months in jail and a £5,000 fine. Where the value of the property is unclear, the court may hear representations as to value, but may also offer the defendant the option of summary trial, with limited penalties.|$|E
5|$|Tran {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in Sacramento County Superior Court on November 6, 2015, charged of the attempted murder of Stone with an allegation of using a dangerous weapon, a knife. He did not enter a plea, was ordered to be held without bail, and was scheduled to return to court December 1, 2015. On December 1, 2015, Tran again appeared in the Sacramento Superior Court for a bail review hearing. This was subsequently postponed, with Tran held without bail. On January 7th, 2016, Tran was again denied bail, and another preliminary hearing was set for February 26th, 2016. At the February 26th hearing, Sacramento County Deputy District Attorney Anthony Ortiz informed Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Goodman that his department plans to amend the original criminal charges against Tran, to include gang involvement in the assault. A gang involvement charge in California provides for additional penalties if the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> found guilty. Judge Goodman ordered another hearing to be held on March 30, 2016, {{to determine whether or}} not prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed with the charges against Tran.|$|E
40|$|This study compares final {{sentencing}} decisions {{ordered by}} judges to {{federal and state}} sentencing guidelines for protective order violations. The authors reviewed violations that were pled before the largest district court in Utah and found that {{in the majority of}} cases, <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> not sentenced in accordance with federal and state guidelines. Although state guidelines mandate defendants who violate a protective order to attend a batterer intervention program, less than one fourth of <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> sentenced to attend such programs. Fewer than half of the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> arrested and incarcerated, as opposed to the 100 % mandated by state sentencing guidelines. Federal guidelines mandate that all <b>defendants</b> <b>be</b> ordered to surrender firearms, but only six <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> given that order. This study shows that the judicial system could be more aggressive in improving the safety of victims of intimate partner violence by using {{the full extent of the}} sentencing guidelines...|$|R
2500|$|The case {{then went}} to the Exchequer of Pleas, where it was heard between 3 and 5 May 1865. It was heard on two points. Firstly, whether the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> liable for the actions of the {{contractors}} and secondly, whether the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> liable for the damage regardless of their lack of negligence. They decided for the first point that the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> not liable, but more split on the second point. Pollock CB, Martin B and Channell B held that the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> not liable, as since a negligence claim could not be brought there was no valid case. Bramwell B, dissenting, argued that the claimant had the right to enjoy his land free of interference from water, and that as a result the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> guilty of trespass and the commissioning of a nuisance. He stated that [...] "the general law in matters wholly independent of contract" [...] should <b>be</b> that the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> liable, [...] "on the plain ground that the defendants have caused water to flow into the 's mines, which but for the defendant's act would not have gone there".|$|R
50|$|Additionally, some jurisdictions add the {{question}} of whether or not the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> in control of their behavior at the time of the offense. For example, if the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> compelled by some aspect of their mental illness to commit the illegal act, the <b>defendant</b> could <b>be</b> evaluated as not in control of their behavior at the time of the offense.|$|R
25|$|In general, if a <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> found incompetent {{to proceed}} to trial, the {{criminal}} proceedings are suspended. In those cases, where the charges are petty, the charges are often dropped or a plea bargain may be made in which the charges are nolle prossed if the defendant agrees to seek treatment. Otherwise, the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> usually committed to a psychiatric hospital for treatment until the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> restored to competency, {{at which point the}} trial will proceed.|$|E
25|$|A {{statistical}} test procedure {{is comparable to}} a criminal trial; a <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> considered not guilty {{as long as his}} or her guilt is not proven. The prosecutor tries to prove the guilt of the defendant. Only when there is enough charging evidence the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> convicted.|$|E
25|$|The {{seriousness}} of the offence with which the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> charged.|$|E
50|$|All sixty-four <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> acquitted.|$|R
5000|$|Suppose, {{that the}} {{proposition}} {{to be proven}} <b>is</b> that <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> {{the source of a}} hair found at the crime scene. Before learning that the hair was a genetic match for the defendant’s hair, the factfinder believes that the odds are 2 to 1 that the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> the source of the hair. If she used Bayes’ theorem, she could multiply those prior odds by a “likelihood ratio” in order to update her odds after learning that the hair matched the defendant’s hair. The likelihood ratio is a statistic derived by comparing the odds that the evidence (expert testimony of a match) would be found if the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> the source with the odds that it would <b>be</b> found if <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> not the source. If it is ten times more likely that the testimony of a match would occur if the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> the source than if not, then the factfinder should multiply her prior odds by ten, giving posterior odds of 20 to one.|$|R
2500|$|The eight convicted <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{assembled}} on April 9, 1931, {{and sentenced}} to death by electric chair. The Associated Press reported that the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> [...] "calm" [...] and [...] "stoic" [...] as Judge Hawkins handed down the death sentences one after another.|$|R
25|$|The <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> {{accused of}} having knowingly and willfully participated in {{enterprises}} involving fatal medical experiments upon subjects without their consent.|$|E
25|$|Every death {{sentence}} involves first an eligibility determination {{and then a}} selection of an eligible defendant {{for the death penalty}}. A <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> eligible for the death penalty once the jury has concluded that {{he is a member of}} that narrow class of criminal defendants who have committed the most morally outrageous of crimes. An eligible <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> then selected for the death penalty after the sentencer takes into account mitigating evidence about the character and record of the defendant in order to decide whether that individual is worthy of a {{death sentence}}.|$|E
25|$|Any sexual {{intercourse}} {{with a person}} under 16 years of age is prohibited unless the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> less than 4 years older than the victim except when married to the person {§14‑27.2, 14‑27.4 & 14‑27.7A}.|$|E
5000|$|Upon appeal by Plaintiffs to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Decision, [...] "the {{judgment}} {{in favor of}} <b>defendants</b> <b>was</b> reversed, the district court's order granting attorneys' fees to <b>defendants</b> <b>was</b> vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings." ...|$|R
50|$|The Court, in a {{unanimous}} opinion by Justice Brennan, {{held that the}} collateral order doctrine {{does not apply to}} a forum selection clause. This was not a case where the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> claiming a right not to be tried at all, like a sovereign immunity case, which would be disposed of before the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> even subject to the discovery process. Instead, the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> acknowledging that it could be sued, but merely disputing the appropriate forum for the suit.|$|R
50|$|Official {{documents}} {{verify that}} the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> eligible for farmland distributed by the government under the Farming Land Reform Act and, therefore, did not defraud the government as alleged. Although most of the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> cleared of suspicion, the government conducted a second investigation to punish them.|$|R
25|$|Nominal damages {{consist of}} a small cash amount where the court concludes that the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> in breach but the {{plaintiff}} has suffered no quantifiable pecuniary loss, and may be sought to obtain a legal record of who was at fault.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution of Brazil {{provides}} that only willful crimes against life, namely full or attempted murder, abortion, infanticide and suicide instigation, {{be judged by}} juries. Seven jurors vote in secret {{to decide whether the}} <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> guilty or not, and decisions are taken by majority.|$|E
25|$|Nebraska is {{the only}} state in which the {{sentence}} is decided by a three-judge panel. If one of the judges on the panel opposes death, the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> sentenced to life imprisonment. Montana {{is the only}} state where the trial judge decides the sentence alone.|$|E
50|$|The <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> a {{licensed}} physician that wrote prescriptions to Willie King for 150 grains of heroin, 360 grains of morphine, and 210 grains of cocaine {{as part of}} a maintenance treatment. The <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> indicted under the Harrison Act, but the district court dismissed the indictment.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Defendant</b> <b>was</b> {{featured}} {{on the cover of}} a 1981 Playboy magazine. <b>Defendant</b> <b>was</b> a Playboy model and Playmate of the Year who used these trademarked terms to describe herself via her personal website. Plaintiff’s sued Defendant for Defendant’s under two theories: trademark infringement and trademark dilution.|$|R
25|$|In the end, all the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> acquitted.|$|R
