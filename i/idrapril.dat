40|$|<b>Idrapril</b> is the {{prototype}} of {{a new class of}} ACE inhibitors, characterised by the presence of a hydroxdmic group. Six untreated in-patients with essential hypertension were given single oral doses of the calcium salt of <b>idrapril,</b> <b>idrapril</b> calcium (200 mg) and placebo according to a double blind, randomised experimental design. Supine and upright blood pressure, heart rate, plasma <b>idrapril</b> serum ACE, active renin and angiotensin II were measured at timed intervals for 24 hours after dosing. Plasma <b>idrapril</b> reached a peak after 2 hours (3. 01 mu g. ml(- 1)), and by 12 hours the compound had al most disappeared (67 ng. ml(- 1)). Derived t(1 / 2) was 1. 4 - 2. 2 h. ACE activity was suppressed [from 77. 9 to 3. 3 after 2 hours and 11. 8 after 12 hours nmol(- 1). min(- 1). ml] and angiotensin II production inhibited [from 8. 8 to 3. 1 (after 1 hour) and 7. 5 (after 12 hours) pg. ml(- 1) ] for up to 12 h, while active renin rose up to 24 h [from 12. 3 to 20. 1 (after 8 hours) and 17. 5 (after 24 hours) pg ml(- 1) ]. Compared to placebo, <b>idrapril</b> calcium significantly lowered both supine blood pressure starting at 4 hours (<b>idrapril</b> calcium 140 / 93 mmHg; placebo 157 / 101 mmHg) up to 24 hours (<b>idrapril</b> calcium 142 / 91 mmHg; placebo: 155 / 97 mmHg), and upright blood pressure starting at 3 hours (<b>idrapril</b> calcium 135 / 95 mmHg; placebo 147 / 100 mmHg) up to 24 hours (<b>idrapril</b> calcium 132 / 92 mmHg; placebo 145 / 100 mmHg). <b>Idrapril</b> calcium appears to be an effective ACE inhibitor in essential hypertension, with a hypotensive action for up to 24 h...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{profile and}} biochemical efficacy of <b>idrapril</b> calcium, a novel {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) inhibitor, were evaluated in healthy volunteers after multiple dosing for 5 days at the doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg twice daily. The study was conducted as a double-blind, cross-over comparison of <b>idrapril</b> calcium against placebo. Plasma concentrations of <b>idrapril</b> were determined by an indirect enzymatic method. Urinary concentrations were measured by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (h. p. l. c.). Plasma samples were also analysed for ACE activity. The pharmacokinetics of <b>idrapril</b> calcium did not change significantly between day 1 and day 5. The values of Cmax and AUC were dose-related over the range of doses tested; tmax was 3 - 4 h and apparent elimination half-life was 1. 4 - 1. 6 h. Plasma ACE activity was maximally inhibited (94 - 96 %) at all dose levels and remained more than 80 % depressed from 2 to at least 6 h after <b>idrapril</b> calcium. Although the maximum effect was not dose-related, the duration of inhibition showed some dose-dependency, ACE activity returning to 56, 45 and 29 % of the basal value 12 h after the 100, 200 and 400 mg doses, respectively. There were no clinically significant adverse events experienced by the volunteers. No dose-related effects on blood pressure or heart rate were observed. There were no changes in clinical pathology tests, urine analyses or electrocardiograms after dosing with <b>idrapril</b> calcium. <b>Idrapril</b> calcium, the prototype of {{a new class of}} ACE inhibitors, appears to be well-tolerated.
