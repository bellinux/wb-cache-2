5|$|The second {{match was}} Tyson Tomko, {{accompanied}} by Trish Stratus, versus Chris Jericho. In {{the early stages}} both competitors wrestled inconclusively, reversed each other's attacks, before Tyson backed Jericho into the ring corner and hit him numerous times with <b>his</b> <b>elbows.</b> Afterwards, Jericho attempted to perform the Lionsault, but Tomko rolled out of the way. The match concluded as Jericho performed an enzuigiri on Tomko for the win.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Shearer {{was often}} styled {{as a classic}} English centre-forward, owing to his strength, {{physical}} stature, heading ability and strong shot, which enabled him to be highly prolific goalscorer. Of his 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with his head. Earlier in his career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing chances for fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to his early development as a midfielder. Later on in his career, Shearer played a more forward role, after his age robbed him {{of some of his}} pace. Able to hold the ball up well, he often functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players. Although his strength allowed him {{to hold on to the}} ball, his playing style sometimes brought him criticism â€“ most commonly that his play was too physical, and that he used <b>his</b> <b>elbows</b> too aggressively. It was this which contributed to both of his sendings off, although one was later rescinded on appeal.|$|E
25|$|Standing 185cm tall, with a pale {{complexion}} and slight build, the 20-year-old Coleman did {{not appear}} at all imposing.

25|$|Knott {{was known}} for his {{idiosyncratic}} behaviour on the field. His trademarks included always keeping his shirt collar turned up to protect him from the sun; his sleeves rolled down to safeguard <b>his</b> <b>elbows</b> when diving; and, after a tip from former Northamptonshire and England wicket-keeper Keith Andrew, warming his hands with hot water before going on the field. According to Bob Taylor, Knott preferred strong-backed gloves with full webbing and plenty of padding in the palms, wearing two pairs of Chamois inners with strips of plasticine across the palms.|$|E

25|$|Finding {{the barrio}} Capaya {{completely}} deserted, the platoon ganged-up on Duman who was brusquely interrogated regarding the Katupunero band that raided Bo. Capaya and {{the whereabouts of}} the entire barrio population. The poor Duman, knowing nothing of what transpired in his village as his field was quite far from the village, answered he knew nothing what the soldiers were talking about. Immediately, he was branded as a big liar and was quickly {{accused of being a}} Katipunero himself! The guards took turns in hitting him with their rifle butts on the head, chest and back to force him to talk, but Duman only wept in pain and insisted that he knew nothing. The soldiers continued to beat him up until nothing but blood came out of his mouth, nose and ears. Exasperated, the soldiers tied <b>his</b> <b>elbows</b> in miquit-a-sicu fashion, and with a long rope tied around his neck, the bloodied Duman was taken on foot to the town hall for further interrogation. Once inside the municipal jail, the guards mercilessly beat him up with solid bamboo clubs to extract revolutionary information to no avail. No food or water was given him.|$|E
25|$|Hart played {{football}} for the Edmonton Eskimos from 1937 to 1939 as a centre {{and was considered}} a standout performer at the time. He coached a women's fastball team in Edmonton during the late 1930s {{as well as being}} the captain of a popular baseball team called Hart's All Stars. The players of Hart's All Stars consisted of sheet-metal workers from Edmonton. On Christmas Eve 1941 Hart was almost killed from a bicycle accident which broke both <b>his</b> <b>elbows</b> and thumbs and hurt his back severely. The injuries risked ending Hart's athletic career. The accident had happened while he was on the way to his father Edward to celebrate Christmas with the family when a fire truck drove behind him and forced Hart to swerve to the side where he was hit by another car which propelled him thirty feet foreword on the road and scraped off a large portion of his skin in the process. He spent several months at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton recovering. In the spring, still hospitalized, Hart was visited by Al Oeming, a young neighbor who had been drafted into the Canadian Navy for World War II and after being released from the hospital Hart decided to enlist. Hart enlisted in the Royal Canadian Navy and was appointed the position of Director of Athletics.|$|E

500|$|Adkins {{performed}} as a one-man band, using foot pedals {{to play the}} drums, or simply stomped {{his feet on the}} floor to an often detuned guitar. He once vowed that he would play [...] "twelve to twenty" [...] instruments simultaneously, including playing the piano and organ with <b>his</b> <b>elbows.</b> He noted in interviews that his primary heroes and influences were Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, Little Richard, and Col. Harland Sanders, the inventor of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Adkins attributed his desire to perform as a one-man band to these artists, stating that when he was a child, he assumed the only credited musician in the band must have played all the instruments in the recordings. The first time he saw a guitarist in action, he built a guitar of his own.|$|E
500|$|The {{battalion}} commander was killed, and soon afterwards, orders arrived to seek and destroy any enemy combatants around NaHa. On June 11, 1945, Kizirian was assigned the special task of patrolling to locate elements {{of an enemy}} reserve platoon. His unit moved to attack Japanese soldiers entrenched along a ridge line. Through the smoke and dust, he noticed six stretcher bearers and a wounded Marine that were under heavy machine gun fire. Disregarding his own safety, Kizirian placed himself {{in the line of}} fire and single-handedly attacked the enemy emplacement. The Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces that confronted Kizirian shot him in the legs and abdomen. Unable to walk, he still managed to make his way forward using <b>his</b> <b>elbows</b> to a position where he was able to shoot and kill all 12 soldiers manning the machine gun. Due to these actions, Kizirian was awarded the Navy Cross, the second highest medal in the United States military. The citation provides details about the event: ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1651, the Massachusetts Bay Colony {{was visited}} by three Rhode Islanders {{who had become}} Baptists: [...] John Clarke, Obadiah Holmes, and John Crandall. [...] Massachusetts reacted harshly against the visit, imprisoning the three men, while Cotton preached [...] "against the heinousness" [...] of the Anabaptist {{opinions}} of these men. [...] The three men were given exorbitant fines, despite public opinion against punishment. [...] Friends paid the fines for Clarke and Crandall, but Holmes refused to allow anyone to pay his fine. [...] As a result, he was publicly whipped in such a cruel manner that he could only sleep on <b>his</b> <b>elbows</b> and knees for weeks afterwards. [...] News of the persecutions reached England and met with a negative reaction. [...] Sir Richard Saltonstall, a friend of Cotton's from Lincolnshire, wrote to Cotton and Wilson in 1652 rebuking them for the practices of the colony. [...] He wrote, [...] "It doth not a little grieve my spirit to heare what sadd things are reported dayly of your tyranny and persecutions in New-England as that you fyne, whip and imprison men for their consciences." [...] He continued, [...] "these rigid wayes have layed you very lowe {{in the hearts of}} the saynts." [...] Roger Williams also wrote a treatise on these persecutions which was published after Cotton's death.|$|E

500|$|The {{second half}} {{started off with}} Crayston briefly taking {{on the role of}} a forward, driving in a shot that Smith did well to save. Arsenal's {{forwards}} followed this with a flowing move from James, Hulme and Bastin, with the final move resulting in Bastin heading just wide of the post. Although play in the first half was relatively equal, in the second half Arsenal were the superior side, simply outclassing the Second Division Sheffield United. In the 74th minute a movement was started by James, who passed the ball to Bastin. Bastin dribbled the ball past Hooper before crossing the ball into the centre for Drake, who drove the ball into the roof of the net with his left foot. Moments after the goal United were on the attack, Barton broke down the right wing, crossing the ball in for Dodds who, finding his marker out of position, headed the ball against the bar. Dodds later said in an interview, [...] "I was just about to direct the ball down into the net when a wee fellow called Wilf Copping went up behind me and, in striving to get to the ball, punched me in the back. This had the unfortunate effect of knocking my head backwards so the ball thudded against the crossbar instead of nestling itself {{in the back of the}} net. But for that, who knows, things might have turned out different." [...] Arsenal won the game with a single goal, the match having been mostly full of positive play and relatively free of fouls, although Drake was penalised on five occasions for using <b>his</b> <b>elbows</b> too much.|$|E

"Bucking and gagging" [...] {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of sitting a soldier on the ground, gagging him, then tying his arms and legs together, knees between his arms and a rod or stick inserted over <b>his</b> <b>elbows</b> and under his knees.

In addition, O'Neal frequently used a right-handed jump hook shot to score near the basket. The ability to dunk contributed to his career field goal accuracy of [...]582, second only to Artis Gilmore as the highest field goal percentage of all time.

2500|$|Roberts {{became a}} miner {{and participated in}} the {{gambling}} and drinking typical of that time and place.

But Roberts eventually learned to read and, {{after a series of}} menial jobs, was apprenticed to a blacksmith while attending school. He then became a [...] "voracious reader, devouring books of history, science, philosophy," [...] especially the Book of Mormon and other Mormon religious texts. In 1878, Roberts married Sarah Louisa Smith, and in the same year he graduated first in his class from University of Deseret, the normal school precursor of the University of Utah. He and Sarah eventually had seven children.|$|E

They frantically loaded their rifles, aimed at their escaping prisoner who was just barely ten feet away and fired shot after shot! The bewildered Macabebe civil guards followed suit and started firing deadlier Caliber [...]43 bullets at their fellow Capampangan. Considering the tested accuracy of these then world-class rifles of hitting bulls-eye targets at a distance of 200 yards (roughly 600 feet!), it was incredible how these well-trained professional officers and soldiers could have missed their target, starting from a distance of only ten feet, and after initially firing a total of about twenty shots at their escaping prisoner! ...|$|E
