5|$|Cotto did {{not attend}} the post-fight press conference, but Freddie Roach in his place stated that he {{believed}} his fighter won, by outscoring Álvarez and blocking many of his shots. Cotto later told reporters in Puerto Rico that he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> won.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, {{although}} Hazlitt {{continued to be}} read and his influence was to a degree <b>felt,</b> <b>he</b> was {{throughout most of the}} remainder of the nineteenth century infrequently cited as a critic.|$|E
5|$|When it {{was next}} decided to cast an unknown actor, casting {{director}} Lynn Stalmaster first suggested Christopher Reeve, but Donner and the producers <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> {{was too young}} and skinny. Over 200 unknown actors auditioned for Superman.|$|E
60|$|It {{was over}} a week afore <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>'e</b> could risk letting Miss Tucker see 'im, and then at seven o'clock one evening <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>'e</b> couldn't wait any longer, and arter {{spending}} an hour cleaning 'imself he started out for the Jolly Pilots.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{so glad to}} see you!" [...] he exclaimed, {{for want}} of {{something}} better; and <b>he</b> blushed--he <b>felt</b> foolish, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> false--as <b>he</b> said it.|$|R

5|$|Wyatt Earp <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> {{could not}} rely on civil justice, and decided {{to take matters into}} his own hands. He {{concluded}} {{that the only way to}} deal with Morgan's assassins was to kill them all.|$|E
5|$|According to CompuBox, Álvarez landed 155 of 484 punches (32 percent), and Cotto landed 129 of 629 (21 percent), with Álvarez landing {{the heavier}} blows and inflicting more damage. There was a {{fraction}} of the boxing world that felt Cotto won by both a small margin, while others <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> won decisively. Cotto left immediately after hearing the scorecards, with his team and family.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Uyarndha Manithan, AVM Productions was keen to remake it in Hindi and {{approached}} Dilip Kumar. After watching the film, Kumar was hesitant to play the lead role as he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> would not match Ganesan's performance in the original version. K. Balachander was signed {{up to be the}} director of the remake, which led to Kumar being initially convinced that he could be successful.|$|E
5000|$|... "Bloodstream" [...] {{was written}} by Sheeran, Rudimental, and Snow Patrol members - Johnny McDaid and Gary Lightbody, and {{produced}} by Rick Rubin. The song is about Sheeran taking MDMA during a wedding celebration in Ibiza. He claims that during the experience he [...] "fell {{in love with a}} beanbag" [...] and that [...] "he <b>felt</b> anxiety, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> love, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> warm, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> a bit weird". Sheeran made a live PA to perform the song during Rudimental's set at Glastonbury on 27 June 2014.|$|R
60|$|Chester nodded. For {{a moment}} <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> as <b>he</b> had <b>felt</b> when <b>he</b> left the {{provision}} store in Montrose. But {{he would not}} let Clemantiny see him cry. Somehow, {{he would not have}} minded Miss Salome.|$|R
60|$|Aynesworth helped {{himself to}} a liqueur. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> needed it.|$|R
5|$|Archer's visit precipitated {{a crisis}} in the colonial administration. It was <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> had been far too {{friendly}} to Abd al-Rahman, who was viewed with suspicion by many administrators. Archer was forced to resign, replaced by Sir John Maffey. Abd al-Rahman was placed under restriction on travel outside Omdurman and Khartoum and was told to instruct his supporters to halt their political and religious activities.|$|E
5|$|As a child, {{director}} Pete Docter relocated {{with his}} family to Denmark when his father moved to study the music of Carl Nielsen. While his sisters had an easy time adjusting to the new surroundings, Docter <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was judged constantly by peers. While other kids were interested in sports, Docter sat alone drawing, a hobby that eventually led him to animation. His social anxiety ended by high school.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2009–10 season, manager Dave Hagan and his {{assistant}} Eric Tate left the club. Hagan <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> could not operate a competitive team on the team's small budget, and so took up an assistant job at Consett. Ian Davison, a player at the club, took up managerial duties, acting as a player-manager, and appointing Gary Innes as {{his assistant}}. Steve Murray is the current Tow Law manager, taking up the role in December 2014.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> could promise {{with perfect}} safety. 'Never,' said he.|$|R
60|$|Urmston flushed, glad {{he was in}} {{the shadow}} where Carrie could not see him. <b>He</b> <b>felt,</b> as <b>he</b> had <b>felt</b> before, that <b>he</b> would rather like to gag Eveline Annersly.|$|R
50|$|Turnbull {{was offered}} a knighthood for his railway {{building}} in India, but declined it as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> did not have sufficient money to live to the standard <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> was needed (<b>he</b> later regretted declining the knighthood, if only because it reduced his later earning power).|$|R
5|$|Beginning work on Neon Bible {{immediately}} following a North American tour {{in support of}} the band's first album, Funeral, songwriter Win Butler, born in the United States but having lived in Canada for several years, said that he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was observing his homeland from an outsider's point of view. The album is rooted in Americana themes, with Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Elvis Presley being cited as influences.|$|E
5|$|Besides his {{governmental}} career, Gale was {{a member}} of the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Society, where he served as treasurer. Gale was known as a collector of manuscripts and other antiquarian items, writing a few published works on those subjects. He donated his manuscript collection to his alma mater in 1738, and died in 1744. Although contemporaries <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was one of the foremost scholars of his age, later historians have been less convinced, contrasting his learning unfavourably with his father's.|$|E
5|$|Bowie had {{originally}} {{planned to take}} the Glass Spider Tour to Russia, albeit with the band only (no dancers or elaborate props), but with the money and extra stage provided by the sponsorship, Bowie <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> could take the full tour to Russia and South America. However, these plans failed to come to fruition, and the tour never reached those regions.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> {{that she}} was looking at him; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> equally that <b>he</b> could not respond with a commonplace. He was silent.|$|R
60|$|Here Mr. Dodge laughed; for <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> had got {{the best}} of it.|$|R
60|$|Barrington {{was silent}} for several moments. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> was {{receiving}} but scanty encouragement.|$|R
5|$|Brock <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> {{needed to}} go further. He was {{hampered}} by Governor General George Prevost, who had replaced Craig in late 1811. Prevost's orders from the government, and his own inclinations, were to emphasise defence. Prevost kept {{the bulk of his}} forces in Lower Canada to protect Quebec, and opposed any attack into United States. Brock also believed that he was handicapped by inertia and defeatism among the Legislature and other officials.|$|E
5|$|By late 1975, {{after seven}} years at the helm, Charles Perry <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> had {{accomplished}} his goal and left the university to become {{president and publisher of}} the Sunday newspaper magazine Family Weekly (now USA Weekend), one of the country's largest magazines. When he left, there were more than 10,000 students attending classes and a campus with five major buildings and a sixth being planned.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{strength}} of Malvern Hill, as demonstrated in the battle, McClellan <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> needed to continue with his planned withdrawal to Harrison's Landing, to Fitz John Porter's chagrin. Porter felt that the Army of the Potomac should remain atop the hill or perhaps even continue their advance to Richmond. McClellan however insisted that Confederate troops greatly outnumbered his own, <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> could not protect Harrison's Landing from his current position at Malvern Hill, and feared being cut off from his supply depot. McClellan's mentality prevailed. The Union batteries and McClellan's engineers began moving to Harrison's Landing soon {{after the end of}} the Battle of Malvern Hill. Starting at about 11p.m. unit after unit began to follow. Within hours, nearly all of McClellan's Army of the Potomac was marching towards Harrison's Landing. Once the last of these men had crossed the Turkey Island Bridge, they destroyed the bridge and felled trees over it to stymie any pursuit, leaving the James River between the Union and Confederate armies.|$|E

60|$|He tottered to his chair. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> her draw {{his arms}} about her neck; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> her put her own round his; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> her kisses on his face; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> her wet cheek laid against his own; he felt--oh, how deeply!--all {{that he had}} done.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the release}} of It's a Feedelity Affair in 2006, Lindstrøm had become tired of {{producing}} dance remixes and average length vocal pieces. He began giving the artists and labels mixes with slower tempos. Lindstrøm also <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was unwisely incorporating musical ideas into remixes instead of original works, which led to experiments with lengthier tracks for an original album. Four to five tracks were originally envisioned for Where You Go I Go Too, but only three were chosen.|$|E
5|$|Further {{advancement}} of rank was facilitated with Conroy's marriage to Elizabeth Fisher on 26 December 1808 in Dublin, {{though not as}} far as Conroy <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> deserved. Elizabeth {{was the daughter of}} Colonel (later Major-General) Benjamin Fisher and Conroy served under him in Ireland and England while performing various administrative duties. Conroy was promoted to Second Captain on 13 March 1811 and appointed adjutant in the Corps of Artillery Drivers on 11 March 1817.|$|E
5|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska (1946–1975) was a Quarter Horse broodmare who {{produced}} eight foals, {{three of which}} would become world champion race horses. When she was a yearling, she was sold by her owner, although he had not really planned on selling her. He <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> had to because one of his employees had told a customer the filly was for sale.|$|E
60|$|Duncombe {{hastened to}} his place. His eyes were bright. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> was walking upon air.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> {{would never}} {{understand}} a woman. But his fingers wandered through her tobacco-coloured hair.|$|R
