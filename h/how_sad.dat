5|$|Shaw {{made his}} Broadway debut in 1929, {{when he played}} the murderer Wyndham Brandon in Patrick Hamilton's stage thriller, Rope's End. In 1929, he married Margaret Delamere and lived {{with her in the}} Albany, an {{apartment}} complex off of Piccadilly in London. The two would eventually have a daughter together named Drusilla (born 1932). He returned to the works of William Shakespeare in 1931, playing Claudio in Measure for Measure at London's Fortune Playhouse. In 1932 he once again played Romeo at the Embassy Theatre. Other works around this period included productions of Ivor Novello's Sunshine Sisters in 1933, Double Door alongside actress Sybil Thorndike in 1934, J.M. Barrie's A Kiss for Cinderella in 1937, and Robert Morley's Goodness, <b>How</b> <b>Sad</b> in 1938.|$|E

He {{explains}} that he is superior to Mopsus in musical skill, looks and wealth. He explains that he cannot work without Phyllis. He explains that, if Phyllis is afraid that he might beat her, he shall have his hands bound (and reminds her {{of a time when}} Mopsus' own hands were bound, after he was caught thieving). He tells of the gifts of flowers he used to bring to Phyllis, and further mocks Mopsus. He threatens to hang himself if Phyllis does not return to him, and that a poem will be inscribed upon the tree from which he is hanged, telling of the affair.|$|E

500|$|In 1939, Le Mesurier {{accepted}} {{a role in}} the Robert Morley play Goodness, <b>How</b> <b>Sad!,</b> directed by June Melville—whose father Frederick owned a number of theatres, including the Lyceum, Prince's and Brixton. Melville and Le Mesurier soon began a romance, and were married in April 1940. Le Mesurier was conscripted into the army in September 1940; after his demobilisation in 1946, he discovered that his wife had become an alcoholic: [...] "She became careless about appointments and haphazard professionally". As a result, the couple separated and were divorced in 1949.|$|E
500|$|From November to December 1939, Le Mesurier toured Britain in a {{production}} of Goodness, <b>How</b> <b>Sad,</b> during which time he met the director's daughter, June Melville, whom he married in April 1940. After spending January and February 1940 in French Without Tears at the Grand Theatre in Blackpool, he returned to London where he was employed by the Brixton Theatre, appearing {{in a series of}} productions. In his time in repertory, Le Mesurier took on a variety of roles across a number of genres; his biographer Graham McCann observed that his range included [...] "comedies and tragedies, thrillers and fantasies, tense courtroom dramas and frenzied farces, Shakespeare and Ibsen, Sheridan and Wilde, Molière and Shaw, Congreve and Coward. The range was remarkable".|$|E
500|$|The move to {{the sixth}} series also meant Gaiman had to include Rory, who had ceased {{to exist in the}} {{original}} slot in the fifth series. With Rory included, Gaiman had to [...] "reshape" [...] much of {{the second half of the}} episode, featuring Amy being on the run in the TARDIS. In the original draft where Amy was the only companion, Gaiman added a [...] "heartbreaking monologue" [...] by the character, further stating [...] "you get to see what it's like to be the companion from the companion's point of view, and she got to talk about essentially in that version <b>how</b> <b>sad</b> it is, in some ways. One day something will happen to her, she'll get married, she'll get eaten by monsters, she'll die, she'll get sick of this, but he'll go on forever." [...] At a certain point, Gaiman became tired of rewriting drafts and asked Steven Moffat for help. Moffat wrote in what Gaiman called [...] "several of [...] best lines" [...] and rapidly rewrote several scenes when budget problems harmed filming locations.|$|E

50|$|SADs {{are widely}} {{accepted}} to be byproducts of magnetic reconnection, the physical process that drives solar flares by releasing energy {{stored in the}} Sun’s magnetic field. Reconnection reconfigures the local magnetic field surrounding the flare site from a higher-energy (non-potential, stressed) state to a lower-energy (potential) state. This process is facilitated {{by the development of}} a current sheet, often preceded by or in tandem with a coronal mass ejection. As the field is being reconfigured, newly formed magnetic field lines are swept away from the reconnection site, producing outflows both toward and away from the solar surface, respectively referred to as downflows and upflows. SADs are believed to be related to reconnection downflows that perturb the hot, dense plasma that collects above flare arcades, but precisely <b>how</b> <b>SADs</b> form is uncertain and is an area of active research.|$|R

500|$|In 2003, Nina's mother, Trixie (Wendy Stapleton), {{arrived in}} Erinsborough after Nina's father, Nick, ended their relationship. Nina was upset {{to learn about}} her parents split and went into denial. She {{believed}} that they would get back together. Trixie was a professional singer and, during a set at Lou's Place, started to lose confidence, so Nina helped her out and saved the night. Stapleton stated that Nina and Trixie's relationship was complicated, and there were issues between them. Nina saw Trixie as an embarrassment, but she helped her out because she saw <b>how</b> <b>sad</b> her mother was. Stapleton explained more about Nina's early life saying, [...] "Nina's life has been almost a gypsy one – living out of a suitcase while her parents toured. She's learned to be independent from an early age, though Trixie idolises her." [...] Nina retreated into books and her imagination instead of being worldly from the travelling she has done. Stapleton and Goodrem {{did not get a}} chance to explore their respective character's relationship much further, as Goodrem was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma three weeks into the storyline. Scripts were changed so Nina was not directly involved and she was only mentioned by other characters.|$|E
500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter <b>how</b> <b>sad</b> or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E
500|$|Neela Debnath of The Independent commented {{positively}} on the show's continuing {{exploration of}} the Daleks and the more [...] "adult tone", praising {{the performance of the}} three leads. Radio Times writer Patrick Mulkern stated that it [...] "ticks all [...] boxes as a Doctor Who fan of more than 40 years standing", describing it as [...] "clever, fast, funny, eerie, surprising and tearjerking". Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the episode five out of five stars, calling it a [...] "strong, cinematically-minded series opener" [...] which succeeded in making the Daleks scary. He also praised Coleman's debut, Smith's performance, the special effects, and Amy and Rory's emotional subplot. io9 reviewer Charlie Jane Anders noted that the plot [...] "is mostly just an excuse to explore the Doctor's ongoing relationship with the Daleks, and to show <b>how</b> <b>sad</b> it's gotten". Both Anders and Mulkern (the latter citing a Doctor Who veteran, Katy Manning) noted that Oswin's fascination with eggs, required for making soufflés, is really just a mental trick to block out the [...] "exterminate" [...] ("eggs-terminate") conditioning; this literary device is woven throughout the episode as a series of subtle hints, as Rory is confused by a dormant Dalek, initially misinterpreting him as saying [...] "eggs".|$|E

500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that just goes to show how well thought out, creative, and just plain fun tonight’s “Fringe” really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching Walter talk about <b>how</b> <b>sad</b> and guilty he feels about everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, {{it would be great if}} the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t do a great job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E
500|$|As was {{the common}} {{practice}} for Italian films at the time, shooting was done without sound; dialogue was added later along {{with music and}} sound effects. [...] As a consequence, cast members generally spoke in their native language during filming: Quinn and Basehart in English, Masina and the others in Italian. [...] Liliana Betti, Fellini's long-time assistant, has described the director's typical procedure regarding dialogue during filming, a technique he called the [...] "number system" [...] or [...] "numerological diction": [...] "Instead of lines, the actor has to count off numbers in their normal order. [...] For instance, a line of fifteen words equals an enumeration of up to thirty. [...] The actor merely counts til thirty: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. etc." [...] Biographer John Baxter has commented on the usefulness of such a system: [...] "It helps pinpoint an instant in the speech where he [...] wants a different reaction. 'Go back to [...] "27",' he'll tell an actor, 'but this time, smile.'" [...] Since he didn't {{need to worry about}} noise while shooting a scene, Fellini would keep up a running commentary during filming, a practice that scandalized more traditional filmmakers, like Elia Kazan: [...] "He talked through each take, in fact yelled at the actors. 'No, there, stop, turn, look at her, look at her. [...] See <b>how</b> <b>sad</b> she is, see her tears? [...] Oh, the poor wretch! [...] You want to comfort her? Don't turn away; go to her. [...] Ah, she doesn't want you, does she? What? Go to her anyway!'... That's how he's able... to use performers from many countries. [...] He does part of the acting for the actors." ...|$|E
500|$|The comedy The Careless Husband (1704), {{generally}} considered to be Cibber's best play, is another example of the retrieval of a straying husband by means of outstanding wifely tact, this time in a more domestic and genteel register. The easy-going Sir Charles Easy is chronically unfaithful to his wife, seducing both ladies of quality and his own female servants with insouciant charm. The turning point of the action, known as [...] "the Steinkirk scene", comes when his wife finds him and a maidservant asleep together in a chair, [...] "as close an approximation to actual adultery as could be presented on the 18th-century stage". His periwig has fallen off, an obvious suggestion of intimacy and abandon, and an opening for Lady Easy's tact. Soliloquizing to herself about <b>how</b> <b>sad</b> it would be if he caught cold, she [...] "takes a Steinkirk off her Neck, and lays it gently on his Head" [...] (V.i.21). (A [...] "steinkirk" [...] was a loosely tied lace collar or scarf, named after the way the officers wore their cravats at the Battle of Steenkirk in 1692.) She steals away, Sir Charles wakes, notices the steinkirk on his head, marvels that his wife did not wake him and make a scene, and realises how wonderful she is. The Easys go on to have a reconciliation scene which is much more low-keyed and tasteful than that in Love's Last Shift, without kneelings and risings, and with Lady Easy shrinking with feminine delicacy from the coarse subjects that Amanda had broached without blinking. Paul Parnell has analysed the manipulative nature of Lady Easy's lines in this exchange, showing how they are directed towards the sentimentalist's goal of [...] "ecstatic self-approval".|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes {{described}} as [...] "France's Frank Sinatra", Aznavour sings frequently about love. He has written musicals and {{about more than}} eight hundred songs, and made {{more than one hundred}} records. Aznavour's voice is shaded towards the tenor range, but possesses the low range and coloration more typical of a baritone, contributing to his unique sound. Aznavour speaks and sings in many languages (French, English, Italian, Spanish, German, Russian, Armenian, Neapolitan), which has helped him perform at Carnegie Hall, in the USA, and other major venues around the world. He also recorded at least one song from the 18th century Armenian poet Sayat Nova, and a popular song, Im Yare in Armenian. Que C'est Triste Venise, sung in French, Italian (Com'è Triste Venezia), Spanish (Venecia Sin Ti), English (<b>How</b> <b>Sad</b> Venice Can Be), and German (Venedig in Grau), is one of Aznavour's most famous multilingual songs.|$|E
2500|$|Also on 24 July, after Berchtold {{met with}} the Russian chargé d'affaires, furious {{complaints}} were prompted from Berlin, warning that Austria should not engage in talks with any other powers in case a compromise might be worked out.

Austria must become predominant in the Balkans {{as compared to the}} little ones, and at Russia’s expense." [...] Count Szögyény reported to Vienna that [...] "here, it is generally taken for granted that if Serbia rejects our demands, we shall at once reply by declaring war, and opening military operations. We are advised... to confront the world with a fait accompli (emphasis in the original)." [...] When the German ambassador in Belgrade reported <b>how</b> <b>sad</b> the Serbian people were with being faced with the choice of either war or national humiliation, Wilhelm wrote on the margins of the report: [...] "Bravo!

2500|$|The Emperor and Empress both {{decided to}} send Nicholas and George on a nine-month-long trip to Japan in 1890. George would go as a naval cadet and Nicholas to {{complete}} his education by seeing something of the world. Their mother hoped the warm sun and the sea air would improve George's health. They left Gatchina on 4 November 1890. The Empress had never been separated from her sons {{for such a long}} time and she missed them terribly. [...] "You cannot imagine <b>how</b> <b>sad</b> and hard it is to be without you, my angel, and how dreadfully it hurts to think of this long separation", she wrote sadly. Nicholas and George first went by warship to Athens where they were joined by their cousin, Prince George of Greece, known as [...] "Greek Georgie". From there, they traveled to Egypt. From [...] Bombay in India, Nicholas telegraphed that his brother George had to remain on ship because he had trouble with his leg. Although George assured his parents that he was perfectly well, they were suddenly informed he had a fever and would have to return home. The Empress was alarmed. [...] "You can't imagine in what anguish I have passed these last few days", she wrote. [...] "In spite of all the reasoning ... I had to take things calmly, and to tell myself that it ... is only this horrible malaria that will pass with a change of air ..." [...] George, in fact, had acute bronchitis and was sent back to Athens where he could be examined by the Imperial doctors. The Empress was distressed for both brothers: George, whose disappointment she felt deeply and Nicholas, who was now deprived of his brother's company.|$|E

40|$|Species {{abundance}} distributions (SADs) follow one of ecology's {{oldest and}} most universal laws - every community shows a hollow curve or hyperbolic shape on a histogram with many rare species {{and just a few}} common species. Here, we review theoretical, empirical and statistical developments in the study of SADs. Several key points emerge. (i) Literally dozens of models have been proposed to explain the hollow curve. Unfortunately, very few models are ever rejected, primarily because few theories make any predictions beyond the hollow-curve SAD itself. (ii) Interesting work has been performed both empirically and theoretically, which goes beyond the hollow-curve prediction to provide a rich variety of information about <b>how</b> <b>SADs</b> behave. These include the study of SADs along environmental gradients and theories that integrate SADs with other biodiversity patterns. Central to this body of work is an effort to move beyond treating the SAD in isolation and to integrate the SAD into its ecological context to enable making many predictions. (iii) Moving forward will entail understanding how sampling and scale affect SADs and developing statistical tools for describing and comparing SADs. We are optimistic that SADs can provide significant insights into basic and applied ecological science...|$|R
