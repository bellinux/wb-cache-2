Common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), a plant with fluffy white plumes native to wet hollows on high moors, was announced as the county flower of Greater Manchester. The house sparrow, common starling, and common blackbird are among the most populous bird species in Greater Manchester; Eurasian magpie and feral pigeon are common and breed in habitats across the county.

50|$|The {{ecology of}} <b>floating</b> <b>water-plantain</b> in ponds {{is not well}} understood, but {{generally}} it seems to require broadly low nutrient, soft water situations with some disturbance, such as lowland heathland pools subject to grazing by livestock.|$|E
50|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>water-plantain</b> {{appears to}} require {{a certain amount of}} {{disturbance}} to survive as it is a poor competitor, and therefore does best in situations where there {{is a certain amount of}} disturbance to suppress the growth of competing species. In Llyn Egnant and Llyn Teifi (Wales, UK), which are used as reservoirs for public water supply, <b>floating</b> <b>water-plantain</b> probably benefits from the resulting increase in water level fluctuation, suppressing competition from other aquatic plants and promoting flowering. However, in sites where water level fluctuations are larger in amplitude, L. natans is absent. Lake populations of this plant are strongly associated with soft-water conditions and low nutrient concentrations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>water-plantain</b> grows {{predominantly}} in base-poor lakes, {{ponds and}} slow-flowing rivers {{with low to}} moderate nutrient levels, although {{in some cases it}} appears able to tolerate alkaline systems and / or high nutrient levels.

5000|$|The {{range of}} <b>floating</b> <b>water-plantain</b> is uncertain. It is widely {{distributed}} in western and central Europe, with confirmed records from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. It is also present but rare in northern Spain, the Czech Republic, Norway and Sweden.|$|E
50|$|In the past, <b>floating</b> <b>water-plantain</b> {{has proved}} {{successful}} at exploiting {{certain types of}} artificial habitats, notably the British canal system and the Dombes traditional fish pond system in France. Both these systems have in common a moderate level of disturbance which helps to suppress competing species that might otherwise exclude it.|$|E
50|$|Within Europe, <b>floating</b> <b>water-plantain</b> {{is listed}} under Annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive and Appendix I of the Bern Convention. Within Britain {{it is on}} Schedule 4 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, etc.) Regulations 1994; Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981, and on the IUCN Red List it is {{classified}} as 'Least Concern'(LC).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>water-plantain</b> {{seems quite}} {{tolerant}} of acidification, {{as evidenced by}} its relative abundance in several Welsh lakes that have suffered severe declines in pH due to acid rain, and also seems able to tolerate moderate water level fluctuation as is seen when certain lakes were converted to reservoirs. Losses have mainly been associated with nutrient enrichment (eutrophication), {{such as in the}} Shropshire-Cheshire meres.|$|E
50|$|In Britain, <b>floating</b> <b>water-plantain</b> {{is rare in}} river habitats. River {{populations in}} general occur in slow-flowing, low-gradient {{sections}} of base-poor rivers along with aquatic plants such as intermediate water-starwort Callitriche hamulata, bog pondweed Potamogeton polygonifolius and shoreweed Littorella uniflora. These populations are small and associated with upstream lakes that may act as sources of propagules. Riverine populations in France and Denmark are associated with natural river-floodplain systems where new oxbow lakes are constantly being created by erosion and deposition.|$|E

50|$|Since 1973 the Sandwater {{and several}} {{surrounding}} wetland areas {{with a total}} area of 59 ha have been designated as a nature reserve. The extensive reed beds have an important function in providing nesting and feeding grounds for reed breeders and waterfowl. The expanding beds of common reed, however, are causing the lake to gradually silt up and reduce the area of open water - currently still about 0.223 km² (22.3 ha). Here large carpets of floating plants - the White and Yellow Water Lilies - dominate the scene, and also accelerate the accumulation of mud and silt. Since the lake was dyked {{at the beginning of}} the 1960s and the surrounding area drained, the original hydrology and eutrophication of the lake has changed considerably. Previously the Sandwater had a particularly rich variety of underwater flora which produced relatively nutrient-rich, clean water (c.f. its name!), for example it contained many rare species of pondweed as well as von <b>Floating</b> <b>Water-plantain</b> (Luronium natans) and Lesser Water-plantain (Baldellia ranunculoides). Today plants such as Frogbit, Water Violet, Flowering Rush and Arrowhead may be seen.|$|E

40|$|Luronium natans (<b>Floating</b> <b>Water-plantain)</b> is a European endemic {{aquatic plant}} {{which is now}} rare and {{threatened}} across most of its extant range. Confusion with similar species has led to misunderstanding of its distribution and status in Britain and Ireland, but oligotrophic upland lakes now seem to hold the main populations. Isozyme studies show comparatively high levels of genetic variation among native populations in Wales, contrasting {{with the lack of}} variation reported in some closely-related aquatic species, but there is close similarity among samples of plants from canal populations on the Welsh borders. It has spread into this canal habitat relatively recently (post-l 850), and the isozyme patterns found there indicate that the canal populations have originated from a native lake population connected to the canals by feeder streams. The greatest range of genetic variation now appears to remain in a few native "core " sites, and the survival of these populations is thus of particular importance. Conservation priorities are discussed in relation to the biology, distribution and metapopulation structure of the species in Britain and Ireland...|$|E
