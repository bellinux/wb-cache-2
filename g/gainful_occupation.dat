50|$|As one of {{the very}} few {{remaining}} expressions of Palatka Music, the Palatka Gypsy Band can be considered the last avatar of a centuries-old tradition. But this is precisely where the distinction lies: within the táncház-revival, little or no emphasis has been laid on artistic personalities among vernacular musicians: in spite of growing integration into an international and commercial performing pattern (nowadays, vernacular folk musicians from Transylvania tend to earn more from non-traditional performances, held in cities, or in summer camps organized in rural locations of the area, but generally not for locals), their (mostly improvised) management tended to treat them as ethnological “hold-outs,” which is partly in keeping with the idea some of those musicians have of themselves, but ultimately risks freezing their reputation and activity within the diminutive frame of a relatively small group of folk aficionados, which is unable to sustain a number of events and/or a level of remuneration sufficient to guarantee the future of those bands and, therefore, the survival of their musical traditions. In other words: under-marketing the artists for the sake of authenticity might prove to bring the opposite result: seeing even more folk musicians migrate towards mass-market genres, or abandoning music altogether for more <b>gainful</b> <b>occupations.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the seventh census of {{population}} in Canada, taken as of June 1, 1931, are comprised in 14 octavo volumes, of which all except the final volume of maps and graphs and certain monographs {{to be included in}} the two volumes of census monographs, have been issued. The present review is confined to the population census proper, including, however, the topics of <b>gainful</b> <b>occupations,</b> earnings, and unemployment; on the other hand, agriculture, merchandising and services, and institutions are omitted. In other words, the present review is limited to volumes I-VII, together with those monographs included in volumes XII and XIII which treat the topics of these seven volumes, so far as the monographs themselves have been issued. The advantage of considering the monographs in connection with the corresponding topics of the census itself is obvious, since the detailed analytical treatment of the former helps to throw into clear light the census findings and adds materially to the value of the results. An outline of the contents of the several volumes may help to give perspective to the whole subject. Volume I contains, in addition to the administrative summary of the work of the census, a brief analysis and comment on each of the major subjects covered by the census, together with a selection of tables on all topics; the text covering 344 pages and the tables 1, 177 pages.

They completed a questionnaire including questions about occupational experiences in relation to their patterns of daily occupations, perceived health, and socioeconomic factors. The {{results of the present study}} showed that a combination of different experience dimensions of patterns of daily occupations was associated with perceived health among women of working age, even when adjusted for socioeconomic factors and age. The results provided occupational pattern-related health indicators, i. e. manageability, personally meaningful occupations, and occupational balance.

40|$|Most {{females in}} rural India {{experience}} the vicious circle {{of lack of}} access to education, early marriage, and deprivation of opportunities for <b>gainful</b> employment. Women’s <b>occupations</b> that contribute to rural economy, although integral, are not valued, unpaid and this invisible, resulting in women deprived of economic resources, such as ownership of property. This leaves them disempowered, marginalized, oppressed and unable to fully participate in society. They remain for generations victims of social and economic injustices. This paper will describe (a) the impact of the social and cultural contexts on women’s everyday occupations and (b) a model for social change that has evolved out of the partnership between residents of four villages and a non-government organization. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the instructors of family life education program using a focus group format. The primary intent of the interview was to gather data on their everyday occupational lives and how (if any) changes had occurred due to their involvement in the community programs. The women unanimously reported transformative changes that have impacted positively on their daily lives and family relationships, thereby improving the wellbeing of self and family. They attributed these benefits to the acquisition of new occupations that has expanded their occupational contexts, roles and identity, altered their routines and habits, and increased community participation. The meaningfulness of this increased participation stems from working for the common good of all women and to promote social change. A serendipitous discovery during the interview was the power of group work and the strong relationships that have been forged {{as a result of a}} shared commitment to empowering and improving the daily lives of rural women. It was apparent that the group identity is a strong influence on their individual identities and everyday lives.

40|$|Data {{from the}} public use sample of the 1900 census are used to study the proper labor force {{classification}} of older male Americans experiencing 6 months or more of unemployment {{in the previous year}} ("long-term unemployed"). In terms of their personal characteristics, the long-term unemployed were similar in many respects to persons with a <b>gainful</b> <b>occupation.</b> Because the probability of re-employment, conditional on unemployment, appears to have declined with age, the probability of experiencing long-term unemployment rose as persons aged.

40|$|The USA {{has shown}} {{one of the}} lowest {{unemployment}} rates among the western industrial nations during recent years - though with large upward deviations for young people or certain ethnic groups. The short duration of unemployment could be attributable to the following two factors: firstly the American social system is far less well extended than in western Europe. There is therefore considerable pressure to take up work, if necessary with lower pay. Secondly there is a wide range of jobs, from well paid to very poorly paid, which permit <b>gainful</b> <b>occupation</b> and make possible a steady increase in employment. Thus in particular the ability of the American economy to create additional jobs constantly and to integrate an increasing labour force potential into the labour market is astonishing. The higher American employment growth compared with Germany can not be put down to a higher rate of economic growth, but to a higher employment intensity of the economic growth. As working hours remained at the same high level and the proportion of part-time employment remained the same, the national income must have been redivided among more people. In fact - with stagnating average wages - a further increase in income differences between the lower and upper income brackets can be ascertained. The employment growth is concentrated in the services sector, in which pay is often low but can in some cases also be above average. An above average increase in employment is also expected in the future for highly qualified activities. The employment successes in the USA were won through increasing wage disparities, social inequality and a high level of poverty. In Europe, therefore, the American way should not be followed without criticism. General wage restraint, redistribution and increased flexibility of working hours can also trigger off employment impulses. Lower starting wages for certain groups or the waiving of social security contributions could improve the employment chances for the low qualified. Proposals in the field of the private services also point in this direction: part of these wage costs could be made applicable for tax reductions. Anegative income tax for low-wage earners could also be considered.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a brief summary}} on Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit (CPPD), the single largest public long-term disability insurance program in Canada. The CPPD provides income security {{to those people who}} have suffered prolonged and severe disability that makes a person incapable of pursing any substantially <b>gainful</b> <b>occupation.</b> The paper discusses the issues that CPPD faces today which includes the number of growing beneficiaries and the increasing cost of disability benefits. Each year between 1997 - 2007 payments rose to 2. 2 % per year and the number of recipients grew by 1. 4 % per year (HRSDC 2011 a). One of the major issues faced by CPPD is the welfare dependency on disability benefits where people with health conditions leave labor market permanently and never return to work despite their willingness and ability to work. This creates labor shortage for the Canadian economy and consequently increases the cost of disability benefits. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to look into this problem specifically and analyze the following research question “Can Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit program have better return-to-work incentives for full labor market integration of beneficiaries, reducing the cost of the program?” The paper focuses on return to work incentives offered by CPPD and makes a comparative analysis of what other OECD countries are doing to integrate people with health conditions into the labor market in order to reduce the cost of their disability benefits. The paper highlights the findings for all OECD countries where deep economic downturns tend to hit disabled people more than the general working age population and hence increases the beneficiary caseload. There are number of reforms introduced by OECD countries to effectively integrate people with health conditions into the labor market. These reforms include countries being more focused on remaining work capacity, making job search activity a requirement for people on disability benefits, offering partial benefits instead of permanent benefits while encouraging people with health conditions to continue applying for employment, moving towards single age benefits, engaging employers and medical professionals, evaluating labor market programs, giving right services at the right time. All these reforms have had a positive impact in reducing the number of beneficiaries and thus reducing the cost of disability benefits, integrating disabled people into the labor force in an effective manner. Canada, like many other OECD countries, shares similar problems including low rates of employment and high poverty risk for people with disability. The report concludes by presenting policy recommendations for Canada in order to improve the effectiveness of its policies for individuals suffering from disability. Some of the policy recommendations include better coordination between federal and provincial governments, evaluation and monitoring of the labor market programs, one stop-shop model, easy access to employment support programs, providing right services at the right time and enhancing employers’ role in managing sickness absences for workers...|$|E
