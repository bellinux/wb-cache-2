5|$|Accepting {{the offer}} on January 19, 2009, Ryan {{immediately}} began {{to carry out a}} plan of action that he had outlined for the franchise's future. He planned to remove the players from distractions {{on and off the field}} and allow them get to <b>know</b> <b>one</b> another to build team chemistry. Thus, training camp was moved to the campus of SUNY Cortland, where the team would be relatively secluded from the media and any other distractions. Ryan and general manager Mike Tannenbaum were also determined to draft a quarterback who could lead and be the face of the franchise. As a result, the team traded up to select Mark Sanchez of USC in the first round with the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|Her most {{documented}} {{romantic relationship}} was with Kurt Cobain. It is uncertain {{when they first}} met, and there are varying accounts of how they came to <b>know</b> <b>one</b> another. Journalist Michael Azerrad states that the two met in 1989 at the Satyricon nightclub in Portland, Oregon, though Cobain biographer Charles Cross has claimed the date was actually February 12, 1990, and that Cobain playfully wrestled Love to the floor after she commented to him in passing that he looked like Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum. According to Love, she first met him at a Dharma Bums show in Portland, while Love's bandmate Eric Erlandson stated that both he and Love were formally introduced to Cobain {{in a parking lot}} after a Butthole Surfers concert at the Hollywood Palladium on May 17, 1991. Sometime in late 1991, Love and Cobain became reacquainted through Jennifer Finch, one of Love's longtime friends and former bandmates.|$|E

40|$|Abstract) The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{reflection}} of the right to <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin in the Czech legal order. Knowledge of one's own origin and the right to <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin constitute not only a legal but also a moral and ethical question. The right to <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin (i. e. the right to <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> parents, one's biological family and one's ancestors) is one of the subjective human rights, which belongs to every natural person. This right is more or less reflected in majority of institutes of family law. The thesis analyses the most important of them and indicates how the right to <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin is reflected in these institutes or it is not, although it should be. The work seeks to highlight possible shortcomings of the legislation and tries to propose possible solutions de lege ferenda. There are also stated (for the purposes of comparison) some examples of foreign legislation in cases of some legal institutes. The diploma thesis is based on the legislation effective on the 26 th March 2016. It is composed of an introduction, five chapters and a conclusion. The first chapter {{deals with the}} right to <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin and its legal regulation in the Czech Republic. It mainly discusses the international conventions that are (in compliance with the Art. 10 of the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|How {{much can}} we turn the screw on counter-examples to the KK principle? The principle, also {{sometimes}} called “positive introspection”, {{says that if}} <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P, <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P. It is widely, although not universally, acknowledged that the KK principle is false, {{and not just for}} the boring reason that <b>one</b> can <b>know</b> that P without having formed the belief that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P. <b>One</b> can <b>know</b> that P, and believe that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P, without knowing that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P, because one is not in a strong enough epistemic position to <b>know</b> that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P (Williamson 2000 : 114 - 30). One’s epistemic position is weaker with respect to the fact that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P than it is with respect to the fact that P itself. But how much weaker can one’s epistemic position be with respect to the fact that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P than it is with respect to the fact that P? Of course, if <b>one</b> does <b>know</b> that P, <b>one’s</b> epistemic position with respect to the fact that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P cannot be so bad that <b>one</b> positively <b>knows</b> that <b>one</b> does not <b>know</b> that P, as opposed to merely failing to <b>know</b> that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P, for knowing is 1 factive: <b>one</b> can <b>know</b> only what is indeed the case.
