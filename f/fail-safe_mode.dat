5000|$|One notable feature advertised at {{the time}} was the [...] "limp home" [...] <b>fail-safe</b> <b>mode</b> which allowed the engine to {{continue}} running for a limited time without any coolant. Supplying fuel to only one cylinder bank in turn, the engine would [...] "air cool" [...] the inactive bank. This technique, combined with its all-aluminum construction and large oil capacity, allows the engine to maintain safe temperatures, allowing a Northstar-equipped car to be driven with no coolant for about 100 mi (161 km) without damage. However, the head gaskets are prone to leak, causing loss of some coolant, and high engine temperatures. These high temperatures are not enough to cause the engine to enter <b>fail-safe</b> <b>mode</b> so they can cause the block to crack.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, {{there was}} the Cadillac Northstar engine series, which {{featured}} a [...] "limp home" [...] <b>fail-safe</b> <b>mode.</b> If the engine lost coolant, the engine controller could cause the engine to run on half of the cylinders, alternating between banks. This would air-cool the engine, allowing it to drive up to 100 miles without coolant.|$|E
50|$|In most reactor designs, as {{a safety}} measure, control rods are {{attached}} to the lifting machinery by electromagnets, rather than direct mechanical linkage. This means that in the event of power failure, or if manually invoked due to failure of the lifting machinery, the control rods fall automatically, under gravity, all the way into the pile to stop the reaction. A notable exception to this <b>fail-safe</b> <b>mode</b> of operation is the BWR, which requires hydraulic insertion {{in the event of an}} emergency shut-down, using water from a special tank under high pressure. Quickly shutting down a reactor in this way is called scramming.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a proposed on-board Telescope Protection Algorithm (TPA) for the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF). This TPA consists of {{hardware and software}} capable of performing both fail-operational and <b>fail-safe</b> <b>modes</b> of operation. In the fail-operational mode, each ephemeris load and slew/dwell command sequence is checked on-board before use. The slew command monitor detects unallowable slew/dwell commands and transfers control to an algorithm which slews to and maintains a safe telescope orientation while preserving precise attitude determination and control. This fail-operational mode is also given the authority to autonomously restart the slew/dwell sequence at a point beyond the faulty command. The fail-safe system consists of software and hardware which detects impending earth, moon, or sun avoidance zone violations and activates a backup hardware safe hold mode. The subject TPA and relevant sensor complement were designed for the SIRTF mission; however, this system can easily {{be used as a}} basis for failure detection and correction {{in a wide range of}} other missions...|$|R
5000|$|On December 18, 2006, the {{aircraft}} crashed {{due to an}} [...] "irreversible unintentional failure in the flight termination ground equipment, which caused {{the aircraft}}'s automatic <b>fail-safe</b> flight termination <b>mode</b> to activate." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reliability can be {{increased}} by using [...] "1oo2" [...] (1 out of 2) redundancy at a part or system level. However, if both redundant elements disagree {{it can be difficult}} to know which is to be relied upon. In the previous train signalling example this could lead to lower safety levels as there are more possibilities for allowing [...] "wrong side" [...] or other undetected dangerous failures. Fault tolerant systems often rely on additional redundancy (e.g. 2oo3 voting logic) where multiple redundant elements must agree on a potentially unsage action before it is performed. This increases both reliability and safety at a system level and is often used for so-called [...] "operational" [...] or [...] "mission" [...] systems. This is common practice in Aerospace systems that need continued availability and do not have a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>mode.</b> For example, aircraft may use triple modular redundancy for flight computers and control surfaces (including occasionally different modes of operation e.g. electrical/mechanical/hydraulic) as these need to always be operational, due to the fact that there are no [...] "safe" [...] default positions for control surfaces such as rudders or ailerons when the aircraft is flying.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} and the performance characterization of model-based health-monitoring algorithms {{for the detection of}} faults in an electro-mechanical flight control actuator for unmanned aerial system flight controls. Two real-time executable position-tracking algorithms, based on predictors with different levels of complexity, are developed and compared in terms of false alarms rejection and fault-detection capabilities, by using a high-fidelity model of the actuator. The algorithms’ performances are evaluated by simulating severe flight manoeuvres, with the actuator in normal condition and with relevant faults (motor coil faults, motor magnet degradation, voltage supply decrease). The results demonstrate that an efficient health-monitoring management can be obtained by using an accurate position-tracking monitor for prompt fault-detection and <b>fail-safe</b> <b>mode</b> engagement, and additional actuator monitors for fault-isolation only...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSafety-impact on flight-critical {{systems such}} as flight or engine control systems {{is a major concern}} for {{aircraft}} equipment designers in civil and military fields. Current avionic equipments related to safety-critical systems are able to detect trivial faults such as loss of power, short circuits, open circuits or threshold overflow. The occurrence of these faults in actuator control loops, if detected, triggers a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>mode.</b> So, although system availability is reduced, the required safety level can still be ensured. This paper emphasizes a design methodology of nonlinear model-based FDI 1 algorithms applied to a Hybrid Stepper Motor (HSM). The proposed design methodology combines a nonlinear dynamic inversion and residual generation using standard continuous Kalman Filter. The proposed fault detection method is based on residual mean-checking analysis, where the parameters are tuned with Kriging method...|$|E
25|$|Yielded {{structures}} {{have a lower}} stiffness, {{leading to}} increased deflections and decreased buckling strength. The structure will be permanently deformed when the load is removed, and may have residual stresses. Engineering metals display strain hardening, which implies that the yield stress is increased after unloading from a yield state. Highly optimized structures, such as airplane beams and components, rely on yielding as a <b>fail-safe</b> failure <b>mode.</b> No safety factor is therefore needed when comparing limit loads (the highest loads expected during normal operation) to yield criteria.|$|R
50|$|Both engines {{featured}} piston skirts {{coated with}} a teflon-based friction-reducing material, and fitted with low-tension, low oil consumption rings. In addition, a new <b>fail-safe</b> cooling <b>mode</b> provided protection even {{in the case of}} a catastrophic coolant loss (such as a punctured radiator). In the event of coolant loss, the engine control unit shuts off fuel to alternate cylinders to reduce the risk of engine damage from overheating. The valves continue to operate, in order to pump cooling air through the cylinders. The cooling system was designed to maintain an ideal engine temperature even when subjected to a prolonged 15 percent gradient in 46 °C (115 °F) weather. A returnless fuel supply system helped to reduce evaporative emissions by providing consistent pressure to the fuel injectors through a high-pressure pump.|$|R
40|$|The control {{strategy}} for sewer pumping stations currently used by Anglian Water, {{and most other}} UK water service providers, is classical on/off switching. This is based simply on the fluid level in the inlet wet well. Such local control can lead to poor performance {{across a variety of}} indicators, including energy costs, hydraulic performance and efficiency. Despite the listed issues, the Anglian Water sewerage system is operating at a satisfactory level in terms of conveying flow to treatment. In clean water systems, artificial intelligence and other techniques have been used to optimise pump scheduling and research is now needed to provide similar efficiency gains for sewerage systems. Artificial intelligence is widely used for different control and automation applications in many areas. There is a limited use of optimal control in clean water systems but little or no research has been done to apply these techniques to waste water. To the best of author's knowledge, this research {{is the first time that}} within the water sector that Fuzzy logic (FL) has been applied specifically to the control of pumping in sewer networks. This thesis presents details of a FL system developed in dry weather flow (DWF) for control of sewer pumping stations for energy and costs savings. This research was a collaborative project between Anglian Water and the University of Sheffield. The FL controller outperformed the Base case representing current practice in terms of increased energy and costs savings and a lower number of pump s'Aitches. The functionalities of the FL controller were achieved by: • A Genetic Algorithm was used to tune the FL controller by determining the base lengths of the Membership Functions and the locations of the peaks (vertices of the membership functions' two non-base edges). • The Rule Base impact on level control was investigated and representative Rule base designs were chosen for each of the electrical tariffs. • The FIS controller was extended to include pump efficiency. Pump efficiency was then taken into consideration by running close to the optimal pump operating point, not taking into account long term pump degradation. • An ANN prediction model was developed for DWF inflow prediction which was trained, tested and validated on flow data obtained from survey. The ANN model has just two inputs (population and trade flow) and thus a flow survey is no longer required in order to tune the FL controller. • The FL controller represents a general solution which can be successfully transferred to another pumping station with different characteristics: wet well dimensions, min/max levels and different pumps. Customarisation is needed in terms of physical characteristics of pump station. Simulation results were confinned by the live trial. • The FL system was tested for its robustness using a wet weather event flow profiles. It continued to demonstrate an ability to supply energy cost savings under wet weather conditions albeit not as optimally as for DWF. Wet weather flow (WWF) was out of a scope of this research. FL control system would switch to <b>fail-safe</b> operating <b>mode</b> during WWF event (on/off control timer controlled mode with the pump switch on point sets to 90 % of maximal level in the wet well). In summary, Anglian Water currently spends £ 13 million annually on energy for wastewater pumping. Around 10 % of pumping stations within Anglian Water could eventually benefit from intelligent control. Energy savings from intelligent control are expected to deliver 5 % or better, based on the results of this PhD research project. This would reduce the annual energy bill of the company by a third of a million pounds. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the activities {{carried out by}} Alenia Aermacchi and Pisa University {{for the development of}} a fault-tolerant Electro-Mechanical Actuator System (EMAS) for a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) UAV application. Provided that the faulttolerance characteristics of an EMAS for aircraft application depends on the whole flight control system architecture, the attention is here focused on the safety analysis and the architecture definition of the single actuator, aiming to point out the effects of the architectural choices on EMAS reliability. The proposed EMAS is developed to be a selfmonitoring equipment. It comprehends a 3 -phase permanent magnet synchronous motor with related mechanical transmission and a digital Actuator Control Unit (ACU) implementing both closed-loop functions and health-monitoring algorithms, so that the EMAS is able to be fail-operative in case of some electrical/electronic faults (e. g. power switch fault, motor phase fault) and to revert in <b>fail-safe</b> <b>mode</b> in case of other faults. The goal of the ongoing research program is to develop a demonstrator EMAS with high technological readiness level, capable to be qualified and certified for a new vehicle...|$|E
