25|$|Mullan did not <b>just</b> <b>work</b> on land claims. He {{acted as}} each state's agent {{on a wide}} variety of issues, {{including}} reimbursement for state expenditures during Indian wars, federal payments to volunteer soldiers during the Civil War, tax overpayments, and indemnities for state underpayments to the federal government. In time, he acted as a kind of lawyer-ambassador, drafting petitions to be presented to Congress and lobbying federal officials. Although Mullan managed to win small settlements for his clients, giving him a solid income, Mullan lived far beyond his means—getting credit and spending money in anticipation of the major payday which awaited him if he could secure the California public lands payment.|$|E

25|$|A {{major issue}} of the {{recording}} sessions was internal strife between band members, namely between Jenkins, and lead guitarist and co-founding band-member Kevin Cadogan. The two actively fought for ownership of the band; Cadogan, {{under the impression that}} the band was made as an equal partnership, was outraged to find that Jenkins had made legal changes to make Jenkins the sole owner of the band. Cadogan was further frustrated by Salazar's and Hargreaves' lack of understanding and indifference to the arrangement. The album was almost not made at all, as the band manager informed Cadogan that Jenkins was attempting to remove Cadogan from the band prior to even starting work on the album. Cadogan did everything he could to stay in the band, including trying to push issues aside in order to <b>just</b> <b>work</b> on the album, having the band and sound engineer over to his home in order to record rough album ideas for two weeks. The sessions worked, but were very difficult, and ended up being the only period where the band worked together with one another. The rest of the album was recorded in solitude, with each member coming into the studio to record their parts of the album alone. The recording process spread itself across multiple other studios over time, one of which being one of the studios where Fleetwood Mac's Rumours had been recorded.|$|E

500|$|The {{popularity}} and recognition received by [...] "Cog" [...] led {{a number of}} other companies to create pieces in a similar vein—either as homages, in parody, or simply to further explore the design space. The first of these was <b>Just</b> <b>Works,</b> a deliberate parody advertisement for the 118 118 directory assistance service in the summer of 2003, in which the Honda parts are replaced with such oddities as a tractor wheel, a flamingo and a space hopper, with impetus provided by two moustachioed runners. <b>Just</b> <b>Works</b> was created by advertising agency WCRS. It was written by Anson Harris and directed by JJ Keith, whose previous work included spots for BT Cellnet, Heinz, and Guinness, and the Oscar-nominated short film Holiday Romance. Honda refused to give WCRS permission to copy their advert, which, under BACC guidelines, prevented either the 60- or 90-second <b>Just</b> <b>Works</b> spots from appearing on British television. Instead, the ad was shown online and promoted virally. <b>Just</b> <b>Works</b> went on to win a number of awards in its own right, including Golds in several categories at the British Television Advertising Awards and the Creative Circle Awards, a Silver Lion from the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, and a Bronze award from The One Club.|$|R

Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I <b>just</b> <b>work</b> hard for myself.

500|$|Madonna's initial work on {{the album}} had started with Shep Pettibone, who {{produced}} her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992). However, she found {{out that they were}} doing the same vein of music from the previous album, which did not please her. At the time, Madonna was a fan of Babyface's song [...] "When Can I See You" [...] (1994), and became interested in working with him, as she wanted [...] "lush ballads" [...] for her record. They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills, with [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] ending up on the album. Recalling the latter's development, the producer commented, [...] "I wasn't so much thinking about the charts. I think I was more in awe of the fact that I was working with Madonna.

His drama teacher, who he has remained with ever since, told him [...] "that you might want to play great roles, but truth is you will get cast as a specific type. <b>Just</b> <b>work</b> out your type.

[...] The first role he was offered was a part in a series called Sign of Life, a show about a rock band, which eventually fell through. Dale only received a couple of auditions during his first year in America, but his break came when he was cast as the South African Al Patterson in four episodes of ER. Since then, Dale has been [...] "busier than ever". He has appeared in many television series including guest appearances on The West Wing, Torchwood, The Lone Gunmen, Californication, and The Practice. Many of these have been recurring roles, such as the part of Tom Morrow in JAG and its spin-off NCIS, as well as appearing in three episodes, including the series finale, of The X-Files, playing the [...] "Toothpick Man". He played the recurring role of Vice President of the United States Jim Prescott for seven episodes of the second season of 24, a part which was originally supposed to be a single scene. Dale had recurring roles in the serial Midnight Man and the Australian series Sea Patrol in 2008. He also had recurring parts on Undercovers, Entourage as John Ellis, the fictional owner of Warner Bros., and the British series Moving Wallpaper as a fictional version of himself.

2500|$|Consultation is an {{important}} part of a school psychologist’s career because it allows school psychologists to reach more children than using direct intervention techniques. Consultation is usually thought of as a triadic relationship with the school psychologist working with another individual in hopes of helping change many students behaviors/grades [...] The individual that school psychologists usually work with during consultation is a parent or teacher. School psychologists consult with parents to address learning and behavioral problems at home that can interfere with school progress. More frequently though school psychologists work with teachers during consultation to reach the many students in their classrooms. School psychologists mainly consult teachers on developing and implementing classroom management techniques and implementing specific interventions for specific students.

This can be to develop school wide programs to combat bullying or improve the entire school’s reading program.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea for}} doing {{animation}} was born from the huge {{success of the}} film The Haunted Hotel, released by Vitagraph and directed by J. Stuart Blackton. It premiered in Paris in April 1907 and immediately there was a demand for more films using its incredible object animation techniques. According to a story told by Arnaud in 1922, Gaumont had ordered his staff {{to figure out the}} [...] "mystery of 'The Haunted Hotel'." [...] Cohl studied the film frame by frame, and in this way discovered the techniques of animation. It should be noted that Cohl, who was always seeking to enlarge his reputation in later life, never corroborated this story. Also, there were a fair number of films released before 1907 with stop-motion and/or drawn animation in them, by Blackton and others, any one of which could have taught Cohl animation, if he didn't <b>just</b> <b>work</b> the technique out on his own. The main reason The Haunted Hotel is significant {{is the fact that it}} was popular enough to make the arduous work of animation profitable.|$|E
