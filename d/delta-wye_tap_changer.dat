40|$|Power {{transformers}} {{are inseparable}} {{parts of the}} power system and the <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> is an equally necessary part of the transformer. In {{order to keep the}} availability of power systems high, the reliability of the transformers must be improved. This can be done by improving the reliability of the <b>tap</b> <b>changer,</b> as <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> failures are the cause {{for the majority of the}} power transformer failures. This thesis focuses on the development of acoustic diagnostics of <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> and the <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> that is investigated for defects in this thesis is the selector switch type <b>tap</b> <b>changer.</b> The reason for choosing acoustic diagnostics is that this is a method which can be used online and can be used with the least disturbance to the normal operation of the power transformer. Special emphasis has been laid on recreating the arcing conditions in the <b>tap</b> <b>changer.</b> Arcing inside the <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> chamber is unavoidable but excessive arcing leads to a multitude of problems, so efforts have been made to acoustically detect the arcing phenomenon. In order to have both flexibility and control over the experimental parameters, the experiments in the following chapters are conducted on three sets of test objects. Furthermore, the type of defects that pose the most imminent threat to the operation of the <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> are focused upon and the most appropriate methods of signal acquisition and processing are determined for these experimental setups.

Vibration monitoring is an effective technique {{that can be used}} to assess the condition of an OLTC nonintrusively. The authors have developed a condition monitoring system for common types of OLTCs that enables the condition of <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> contacts and associated drive system to be inferred from vibration signals. A number of prototype systems have been installed onto OLTCs in distribution zone substations for field trials. Particular emphasis has been given to the detection of faults in a particular type of older <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> that had been prone to a range of faults associated with the switching contacts and drive mechanism.

50|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> physically {{makes the}} new connection before releasing the old using multiple tap selector switches but avoids creating high circulating currents {{by using a}} diverter switch to temporarily place a large diverter impedance in series with the short-circuited turns. This technique overcomes the problems with open or short circuit taps. In a resistance type <b>tap</b> <b>changer,</b> the changeover must be made rapidly to avoid overheating of the diverter. A reactance type <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> uses a dedicated preventive autotransformer winding to function as the diverter impedance, and a reactance type <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> is usually designed to sustain off-tap loading indefinitely.|$|R

40|$|Transmission and {{distribution}} systems naturally operate at multiple voltage levels. The transformers connecting these levels often require on-load <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> {{to regulate the}} voltage and maintain it within statutory limits. Conventional time grading is used between <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> control relays when transformers are operating in series. This ensures that downstream <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> react more slowly to voltage deviations than upstream <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> and prevents hunting between them. This defines a fixed duty of responsibility to each <b>tap</b> <b>changer.</b> In order {{to improve the quality}} of supply it is supposed that the duty of responsibility should not be fixed and should adapt to loading conditions. The proposed system monitors both the transformer secondary voltage and the current to determine the voltage drop that would exist between consecutive transformers. The paper demonstrates that this information can be used to bias the operation of the <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> controllers and hence improve series performance.

40|$|During {{the last}} 50 years {{electricity}} demand has significantly increased. Large amounts of electricity are transported from the {{generation to the}} consumption sites. Overhead lines or underground cables are used to transport the required energy. High voltage levels are used to reduce the transmission losses. Power transformers are responsible for linking the different voltage levels. In addition, power transformers must regulate the voltage of the electricity grid when needed. To achieve the regulation of the voltage, power transformers are equipped with on-load <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> (OLTC). The winding of the transformer is equipped with tapped windings. The function of the <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> is to adjust the output voltage of the power transformer by selecting the different tapped windings and without interrupting the load current. Different OLTC technologies {{are used in the}} market. The most commonly used technology of the last 50 - 60 years is the conventional oil type OLTC (OILTAP). In the last few years, time based maintenance is systematically being replaced by condition based maintenance. Condition based maintenance aims to reduce the costs that are associated with the maintenance of high voltage equipment and prevent possible failures. On-load <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> constitute a vulnerable part of the power transformer and there is a number of power transformer failures attributed to OLTC failures. Diagnostic tools are used to assess the condition of <b>tap</b> <b>changers.</b> The condition assessment of the <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> leads to a decision about the appropriate maintenance. This thesis investigates the possibility of a new diagnostic tool for on-load <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> based on partial discharge (PD) measurements. The research project focuses on the major insulation defects that could hamper the operation of on-load <b>tap</b> <b>changers.</b> The differences between PD activity in star and delta connected <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> are also investigated in this thesis. The conditions that are present in on-load <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> are initially modeled by the use of small scale set ups. Signature PD patterns associated with the major insulation defects are obtained from the small scale set up. In addition, PD measurements are also performed in a small, single phase <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> and in a large three phase, star connected <b>tap</b> <b>changer.</b> The main purpose of this research project is to investigate the applicability of PD measurements as a diagnostic tool to assess the condition of the insulation of on-load <b>tap</b> <b>changers.</b> Intelligent Electrical Power GridsElectrical Sustainable EnergyElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{monitoring}} and control of <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> mechanism of a transformer implementation in an Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) is discussed. It has been a custom for decades to provide a separate panel for on load <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> control for monitoring the tap position. However, this facility cannot either record or transfer the information to remote control centers. As there is a technology shift towards the smart grid protection and control standards, the need for implementing remote control and monitoring has necessitated the implementation of this feature in numerical relays. This paper deals with the programming, settings and logic implementation which is applicable to both IEC 61850 compatible and non-compatible IEDs thereby {{eliminating the need for}} separate <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> control equipment.

For example, in power distribution networks, a large step-down transformer may have an off-load <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> on the primary winding and an on load automatic <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> on the secondary winding or windings. The high voltage tap is set to match long term system profile on the high voltage network (typically supply voltage averages) and is rarely changed.

In the second stage, another combined data set is formed by analyzing the trend of false responses in primary results. Results show significant improvement in performance when combined data set is used for training.

Their performance has been exceptional; however, with deregulation now on the horizon, the frequency and scope of maintenance of these devices has become an issue of concern. Maintenance is certainly important to the proper operation and reliability of tap changing transformers, but time-based maintenance is costly and can erode profitability of a company if unnecessary maintenance is routinely performed on any device. Operations counter-based maintenance is an improved approach but cumulative operations are not always a reliable trigger of need for maintenance.
