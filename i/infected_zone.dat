40|$|The bird infecting {{viral strain}} H 5 N 1, {{commonly}} known as the Avian Flu, is a highly infectious and resilient virus that can be fatal if contracted by humans. Authorities and health services have a major responsibility to citizens to respond quickly to minimize the possibility of a localized outbreak becoming a pandemic. The Avian Flu Tracker is a dynamic Location Based Service (LBS) designed to warn citizens of their proximity to potentially infectious regions. The system tracks the location of <b>infected</b> <b>zones,</b> dynamically estimating the spread of an uncontained area over time. Users subscribed to the service receive SMS messages alerting them of the potential for danger based on their current location, and a recommended course of action. By utilizing a scalable and distributed architecture, predictive modeling and innovative zone technology to assign threat levels to spatial data, Avian Flu Tracker demonstrates that LBS can aid to stem and control the spread of the pandemic...|$|R
50|$|The {{growth of}} {{nitrogen}} fixing nodules on legume {{plants such as}} soybean and pea is either determinate or indeterminate. Thus, soybean (or bean and Lotus japonicus) produce determinate nodules (spherical), with a branched vascular system surrounding the central <b>infected</b> <b>zone.</b> Often, Rhizobium infected cells have only small vacuoles. In contrast, nodules on pea, clovers, and Medicago truncatula are indeterminate, to maintain (at least for some time) an active meristem that yields new cells for Rhizobium infection. Thus zones of maturity exist in the nodule. Infected cells usually possess a large vacuole. The plant vascular system is branched and peripheral.|$|E

The fluid dialysed by the activation of metal ions, which confirmed the presence of metalloproteinases. The silverleaf disease is a basidiomycete pathogenic {{on a wide range}} of host plants. The most notable host plant species include pomaceous and stone fruit species which are substantial for New Zealand’s economy. Cations, such as copper, zinc, and cobalt, are all inhibitory for the control of extract and stimulatory for EDTA-dialysed extract, which could possibly make the processes native cofactors. The amount of proteinases could be variable to the duration of the infection’s presence. Activity was found throughout the <b>infected</b> <b>zone</b> and not just the wound site; therefore, fungal growth and proteinase activity have a direct relationship. Even though zinc-binding metalloproteinases have been found to aid processes such as protein turnover and embryogenesis, it is still unclear as to the role they play in plants. To try to better understand MMPs’ role in plant tissue, the SMEP1 is cloned and analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) reaction. It was found only to be present in mature leaves, which suggest that SEMP1 may play an important role in tissue modeling.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{biodiversity}} in the Congo Basin {{can be at}} once {{a blessing}} and a curse. A good example of a curse is the abundance of insects that cause nuisance and morbidity in this area especially onchercerciasis transmitted by black fly (Similium spp) which {{is a major problem}} in disturbed environments (climate change). Black fly bites reduce the duration a man can work and increase the likelihood of the transmission of onchoceciasis (river blindness) in the tropical rainforest area of Cameroon. In order to decrease nuisance and morbidity caused by black fly and improve farmers’ productivity, a study was conducted between 2007 and 2009 in a portion of Sanaga Valley in Cameroon (Monatele (04 ° 09 N, 11 ° 01 E), Ossebe (04 ° 03 N, 10 ° 36 E), Songndong (03 ° 51 N, 10 ° 15 E), Batombe (03 ° 51 N, 10 ° 10 E) and Ka’a (04 ° 43 N, 12 ° 24 E)), one of the most <b>infected</b> <b>zones</b> of the country. Black fly and non-target insects captured were identified using identification keys. Data recorded on sticky traps and artificial breeding sites were used to evaluate the efficacy of temephos and permethrin, and their impact on non-target associated entomofauna in the reproduction sites of Simulium damnosum. Both larvicides, temephos and permethrin, are effective in the control of black fly though permethrin caused limited undesirable effects on non-target species. Insects of the Order Odonata were more affected by permethrin than insects of the Orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Tricoptera (EPT), which are the most vulnerable orders. This means that it has limited environmental effects when sprayed as specified in this trial and can be used in the integrated vector management of black fly...|$|R
30|$|The {{depopulation}} {{of livestock}} in the Chukumuchu region, and throughout Ngamiland, caused {{the migration of}} many households {{and the majority of}} rural farm labourers to village service centres or regional towns. This migration, and the provision of compensation and relief work which followed, forced the rapid acceleration and consolidation of many longer-term tensions which had hitherto been driving changes within the pastoral management systems of the Chukumuchu region. Firstly, many households took the opportunity to establish a second homestead in the village, especially as there were widespread rumours that the Chukumuchu veterinary zone would be restocked first. For example, 12 out of 24 households questioned in the village migrated to Chukumuchu and established homesteads in 1995 and 1996. Many of these households migrated from the <b>infected</b> red <b>zone</b> {{to the north of the}} Samochima fence, with seven of these 12 migrating from the Xaudum valley.|$|R
40|$|Gamma-herpesviruses (γHVs) are {{widespread}} oncogenic pathogens that chronically infect circulating lymphocytes. How they {{subvert the}} immune check-point {{function of the}} spleen to promote persistent infection is not clear. We show that Murid Herpesvirus- 4 (MuHV- 4) enters the spleen by <b>infecting</b> marginal <b>zone</b> (MZ) macrophages, which provided a conduit to MZ B cells. Relocation of MZ B cells to the white pulp allowed virus transfer to follicular dendritic cells. From here the virus reached germinal center B cells to establish persistent infection. Mice lacking MZ B cells, or treated with a sphingosine- 1 -phosphate receptor agonist to dislocate them, were protected against MuHV- 4 colonization. MuHV- 4 lacking ORF 27, which encodes a glycoprotein necessary for efficient intercellular spread, could infect MZ macrophages but was impaired in long-term infection. Thus, MuHV- 4, a γHV, exploits normal immune communication routes to spread by serial lymphoid/myeloid exchange...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the role}} of phosphatases and {{antioxidant}} enzymes have been documented in phosphorus (P) deficiency tolerance, gene expression differences in the nodules of nitrogen fixing legumes should also affect tolerance to this soil constraint. In this study, root nodules were induced by Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 in two Phaseolus vulgaris recombinant inbred lines (RIL); RIL 115 (low P-tolerant) and RIL 147 (low P-sensitive) under hydroaeroponic culture with sufficient versus deficient P supply. Trehalose 6 -P phosphatase and ascorbate peroxidase transcripts were localized within nodules in which O- 2 permeability was measured. Results indicate that differential tissues-specific expression of trehalose 6 -P phosphatase and ascorbate peroxidase transcripts within nodules was detected particularly in <b>infected</b> <b>zone</b> and cortical cells. Under P-deficiency, trehalose 6 -P phosphatase transcript was increased and mainly localized in <b>infected</b> <b>zone</b> and outer cortex of RIL 115 as compared to RIL 147. Ascorbate peroxidase transcript was highly expressed under P-sufficiency in the <b>infected</b> <b>zone,</b> inner cortex and vascular traces of RIL 115 rather than RIL 147. In addition, significant correlations were found between nodule O- 2 permeability and both peroxidase (r = 0. 66 *) and trehalose 6 -P phosphatase enzyme activities (r = 0. 79 *) under sufficient and deficient P conditions, respectively.

40|$|NADH-dependent {{glutamate}} synthase (NADH-GOGAT; EC 1. 4. 1. 14) is a {{key enzyme}} in primary nitrogen assimilation in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) root nodules. Here we report that in alfalfa, a single gene, probably with multiple alleles, encodes for NADH-GOGAT. In situ hybridizations were performed to assess the location of NADH-GOGAT transcript in alfalfa root nodules. In wild-type cv Saranac nodules the NADH-GOGAT gene is predominantly expressed in infected cells. Nodules devoid of bacteroids (empty) induced by Sinorhizobium meliloti 7154 had no NADH-GOGAT transcript detectable by in situ hybridization, suggesting {{that the presence of}} the bacteroid may be important for NADH-GOGAT expression. The pattern of expression of NADH-GOGAT shifted during root nodule development. Until d 9 after planting, all infected cells appeared to express NADH-GOGAT. By d 19, a gradient of expression from high in the early symbiotic zone to low in the late symbiotic zone was observed. In 33 -d-old nodules expression was seen in only a few cell layers in the early symbiotic zone. This pattern of expression was also observed for the nifH transcript but not for leghemoglobin. The promoter of NADH-GOGAT was evaluated in transgenic alfalfa plants carrying chimeric β-glucuronidase promoter fusions. The results suggest that there are at least four regulatory elements.

40|$|The {{generation}} of lymphoid microenvironments in early life {{depends on the}} interaction of lymphoid tissue-inducer cells with stromal lymphoid tissue-organizer cells.

Furthermore, {{the ability of the}} host to respond to secondary antigens was lost. Restoration of the lymphoid microanatomy was dependent on the proliferative accumulation of lymphoid tissue-inducer cells in secondary lymphoid organs during the acute phase of infection and lymphotoxin alpha(1) beta(2) signaling. Thus, crosstalk between lymphoid tissue-inducer cells and stromal cells is reactivated in adults to maintain secondary lymphoid organ integrity and thereby contributes to the preservation of immunocompetence...|$|R
40|$|Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) {{is a major}} {{antioxidant}} and redox buffer, but is {{also involved}} in other critical processes of plants. Recently, the hypothesis has been proposed that legume nodules are unable to synthesize ascorbate and have to import it from the shoot or root, thus providing {{a means by which}} the plant regulates nodule senescence. The last step of ascorbate biosynthesis in plants is catalyzed by l-galactono- 1, 4 -lactone dehydrogenase (GalLDH). The mRNAs encoding GalLDH and three other enzymes involved in ascorbate biosynthesis are clearly detectable in nodules. Furthermore, an active membrane-bound GalLDH enzyme is present in nodule mitochondria. Biochemical assays on dissected nodules reveal that GalLDH activity and ascorbate are correlated in nodule tissues and predominantly localized in the <b>infected</b> <b>zone,</b> with lower levels of both parameters (relative to the infected tissues) in the apex (87 %) and senescent region (43 %) of indeterminate nodules and in the peripheral tissues (65 %) of determinate nodules. In situ RNA hybridization showed that the GalLDH mRNA is particularly abundant in the <b>infected</b> <b>zone</b> of indeterminate and determinate nodules. Thus, our results refute the hypothesis that ascorbate is not synthesized in nodules and lend support to a previous conclusion that ascorbate in the <b>infected</b> <b>zone</b> is primarily involved in the protection of host cells against peroxide damage. Likewise, the high ascorbate and GalLDH activity levels found in the apex of indeterminate nodules strongly suggest a participation of ascorbate in additional functions during symbiosis, possibly related to cell growth and division and to molecular signaling...|$|E

40|$|Main goal {{of forest}} diseases’ {{management}} {{is to reduce}} economic, biological and aesthetic damages and biodiversity loss caused by plant parasites. The many strategies used can be grouped under two main actions, prevention (prophylaxis in some early writings) and therapy (treatment or cure). Prevention is limited primarily {{by the lack of}} knowledge of the organisms involved, including host plants. Mathematical models have been used to extend the understanding of plant disease epidemiology on a number of fronts, providing an opportunity for a more rational use of resources on expensive field trials and representing a step towards more sustainable control measures. From a curative point of view, current efforts by scientists have focused on developing diseases management (Pest Management = PM) concepts in order to balance the benefits of pesticides with the ecological concerns of their residues contaminating the environment. In this thesis, the two PM principles were applied from an innovative point of view on two case studies: ash dieback caused by Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, which can be considered the most serious disease for Fraxinus genus in Europe, and chestnut ink disease, caused by Phytophthora cambivora and P. cinnamomi. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the two diseases are introduced, in order to permit the evaluation of similarities and differences (chapter I). Subsequently, from chapter II to chapter V, the experimental trials performed are described. In particular, in chapter II a study of the ecological niche of H. fraxineus, with the characterization of the environmental variables associated with naturally <b>infected</b> <b>zones,</b> is reported. This procedure was realized with Species Distribution Models (SDM), widely utilized in the ecological field and only recently applied to plant pathology. The presence of the pathogen was highly correlated to three summer predictors: abundant precipitation, high soil moisture and low air temperature, in comparison with the averages of the study area. The ensemble forecasting technique was then applied to obtain a prediction of the potential distribution of the pathogen at European scale, considering the distribution maps of Fraxinus excelsior and Fraxinus angustifolia, susceptible to the parasite. At last, an innovative method of network analysis permitted to identify the suitable areas that are not reachable by the pathogen with a natural spread. Chapter III reports a study conducted to evaluate six fungicides for their potential to control ash dieback. Initially, in vitro tests of the active ingredients against five different strains of the pathogen indicated thiabendazole, propiconazole and allicin as the most effective fungicides, with lower median lethal doses than procloraz. In contrast, copper sulphate and potassium phosphite were totally ineffective. Subsequently, the antifungal activities of the best three compounds were investigated in planta against H. fraxineus by trunk injection on European ashes inoculated with an indigenous strain. The test was preceded by preliminary trials to maximize the efficacy of injections; in the experimental conditions highest speed was reached with the addition of 1. 2...|$|R

When white oak fine root lengths of infected and Phytophthora -free trees were compared, infected trees had significantly lower fine root amounts. However, <b>infected</b> trees in <b>zone</b> seven had more fine roots. Little difference in pathogenicity between 32 P. cinnamomi isolates was found during white oak seedling stem inoculations.

40|$|Indirect {{evidence}} suggests that legumes can adjust rapidly the resistance of their root nodules to O 2 diffusion. Here we describe experiments using O 2 specific micro-electrodes and dark field microscopy to study directly the operation of this diffusion barrier. The O 2 concentration sensed by the electrode decreased sharply {{in the region of}} the inner cortex and was less than 1 0 mmol m ~ 3 throughout the infected tissue in nodules of both pea (Pisum sativum) and french bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). In a number of experiments the ambient O 2 concentration was increased to 40 % while the electrode tip was just inside the inner cortex. In 13 out of 21 cases the O 2 concentration at this position either remained low and unchanged or increased irreversibly to near ambient values. In the remaining cases the O 2 concentration increased after 1 to 2 - 5 min and then decreased to its former value. These results are ascribed to an increase in resistance of the barrier in response to increased O 2 flux into the nodule. It was shown microscopically that air spaces both at the boundary between the <b>infected</b> <b>zone</b> and the inner cortex, and within the <b>infected</b> <b>zone</b> started to disappear 3 min after nodules were exposed to high ambient O 2 concentrations and had disappeared completely after 8 min.

Together with the large size of these worms relative {{to the size of the}} host crabs and the observations on worm emergence, these life history features indicate that F. erythrocephala is a parasitoid of young shore crabs. Fecampia erythrocephala cocoon abundance is often high in localized areas and size-prevalence information suggests that worms mature rapidly in these crabs. This suggests that F. erythrocephala is an important contributor to crab mortality and to the ecology of shore crabs at these sites...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In 2007 Australia {{experienced}} {{its first}} outbreak of highly infectious equine influenza. Government disease control measures {{were put in}} place to control, contain, and eradicate the disease; these measures included movement restrictions and quarantining of properties. This study was conducted to assess the psycho-social impacts of this disease, and this paper reports the prevalence of, and factors influencing, psychological distress during this outbreak. METHODS: Data were collected using an online survey, with a link directed to the affected population via a number of industry groups. Psychological distress, as determined by the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale, was the main outcome measure. RESULTS: In total, 2760 people participated in this study. Extremely high levels of non-specific psychological distress were reported by respondents in this study, with 34 % reporting high psychological distress (K 10 > 22), compared to levels of around 12 % in the Australian general population. Analysis, using backward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis, revealed that those living in high risk infection (red) zones (OR = 2. 00; 95 % CI: 1. 57 - 2. 55; p < 0. 001) and disease buffer (amber) zones (OR = 1. 83; 95 % CI: 1. 36 - 2. 46; p < 0. 001) were at much greater risk of high psychological distress than those living in uninfected (white zones). Although prevalence of high psychological distress was greater in <b>infected</b> EI <b>zones</b> and States, elevated levels of psychological distress were experienced in horse-owners nationally. Statistical analysis indicated that certain groups were more vulnerable to high psychological distress; specifically younger people, and those with lower levels of formal educational qualifications. Respondents whose principal source of income was from horse-related industry were {{more than twice as likely}} to have high psychological distress than those whose primary source of income was not linked to horse-related industry (OR = 2. 23; 95 % CI: 1. 82 - 2. 73; p < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Although, methodologically, this study had good internal validity, it has limited generalisability because it was not possible to identify, bound, or sample the target population accurately. However, this study is the first to collect psychological distress data from an affected population during such a disease outbreak and has potential to inform those involved in assessing the potential psychological impacts of human infectious diseases, such as pandemic influenza. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Changes in the {{production}} of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a 36 kd protein involved in protein synthesis, within intestinal epithelia can provide an early indication of deviations to normal functioning. Inhibition or stimulation of cell proliferation and PCNA can be determined through immunohistochemical staining of intestinal tissue. Changes in the expression of PCNA act as an early warning system of changes to the gut and this application has not been applied to the fields of aquatic parasitology and fish health. The current study set out to determine whether a population of wild brown trout, Salmo trutta trutta (L.) harbouring an infection of the acanthocephalan Dentitruncus truttae Sinzar, 1955 collected from Lake Piediluco in Central Italy also effected changes in the expression of PCNA. Methods A total of 29 brown trout were investigated, 19 of which (i. e. 65. 5 %) were found to harbour acanthocephalans (5 – 320 worms fish - 1). Histological sections of both uninfected and infected intestinal material were immunostained for PCNA. Results The expression of PCNA was observed in the epithelial cells in the intestinal crypts and within the mast cells and fibroblasts in the submucosa layer which is consistent with its role in cell proliferation and DNA synthesis. The number of PCNA-positive cells in both the intestinal epithelium and the submucosa layer in regions close to the point of parasite attachment were significantly higher than the number observed in uninfected individuals and in <b>infected</b> individuals in <b>zones</b> at least 0. 7 [*]cm from the point of parasite attachment (ANOVA, p[*] Conclusions An infection of the acanthocephalan D. truttae within the intestinal tract of S. t. trutta effected {{a significant increase in the}} number of PCNA positive cells (mast cells and fibroblasts) at the site of parasite attachment when compared to the number of positive cells found in uninfected conspecifics and in tissue zones away from the point of parasite attachment. </p...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus is an {{essential}} nutrient for rhizobial symbioses to convert N- 2 into NH 4 usable for N nutrition in legumes and N cycle in ecosystems. This N- 2 fixation process occurs in nodules with a high energy cost. Phytate is the major storage form of P and {{accounts for more than}} 50 % of the total P in seeds of cereals and legumes. The phytases, a group of enzymes widely distributed in plant and microorganisms, are able to hydrolyze a variety of inositol phosphates. Recently, phytase activity was discovered in nodules. However, the gene expression localization and its role in N- 2 -fixing nodules are still unknown. In this work, two recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), selected as contrasting for N- 2 fixation under P deficiency, namely RILs 115 (P-efficient) and 147 (P-inefficient) were inoculated with Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899, and grown under hydroaeroponic conditions with sufficient versus deficient P supply. With in situ RT-PCR methodology, we found that phytase transcripts were particularly abundant in the nodule cortex and <b>infected</b> <b>zone</b> of both RILs. Under P deficiency, phytase transcripts were significantly more abundant for RIL 115 than for RIL 147, and more in the outer cortex than in the <b>infected</b> <b>zone.</b> Additionally, the high expression of phytase among nodule tissues for the P-deficient RIL 115 was associated with an increase in phytase (33 %) and phosphatase (49 %) activities and efficiency in use of the rhizobial symbiosis (34 %). It is argued that phytase activity in nodules would contribute to the adaptation of the rhizobia-legume symbiosis to low-P environments...|$|E
40|$|Infection of the mitral-aortic {{intervalvular}} fibrosa occurs {{most commonly}} {{in association with}} infective endocarditis of the aortic valve. Infection of the aortic valve results in a regurgitant jet that presumably strikes this subaortic inter-annular zone of fibrous tissue and produces a secondary site of infection. Infection of this interannular zone then leads {{to the formation of}} subaortic abscess or pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricular outflow tract. This <b>infected</b> <b>zone</b> of mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa or subaortic aneurysm can subsequently rupture into the left atrium with systolic ejection of blood from the left ventricular outflow tract to the left atrium. This report describes the echocardiographic findings in three patients with pathologically proved left ventricular outflow tract to left atrial communication. Precise preoperative diagnosis is important, and this lesion should be differentiated from ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva and perforation of the anterior mitral leaflet. Transthoracic echocardiography using color flow imaging and conventional Doppler techniques may show an eccentric mitral regurgitation type of signal in the left atrium originating from the region of the left ventricular outflow tract. However, transesophageal echocardiography provides an accurate preoperative diagnosis and should be used intraoperatively during repair of such lesions...|$|E
40|$|Previously, we {{determined}} the N-terminal amino acid sequences {{of a number}} of putative peribacteroid membrane proteins from soybean. Here, we report the cloning of a gene, GmN 6 L, that encodes one of these proteins. The protein encoded by GmN 6 L is similar in sequence to MtN 6, an early nodulin expressed in Medicago truncatula roots in response to infection by Sinorhizobium meliloti. The GmN 6 L gene was strongly expressed in mature nodules but not in other plant organs. GmN 6 L protein was first detected 2 weeks after inoculation with Bradyrhizobium japonicum and was limited to the <b>infected</b> <b>zone</b> of nodules. GmN 6 L protein was found in symbiosomes isolated from mature soybean nodules, both as a soluble protein and as a peripheral membrane protein bound to the peribacteroid membrane. These data indicate that GmN 6 L is a late nodulin, which is not involved in the infection process. Homology between GmN 6 L and FluG, a protein involved in signaling in Aspergillus nidulans, suggests that GmN 6 L {{may play a role in}} communication between the host and microsymbionts during symbiotic nitrogen fixation.

40|$|Classical {{swine fever}} (CSF) has been present in Serbia {{for a long}} period of time as an endemic disease, and it occurs with lesser or greater {{intensity}} from year to year. Since it is a highly contagious disease of domestic and wild pigs, the outbreaks of the disease causes severe consequences for animal welfare, livestock production and economic losses to the national economies in countries where it occurs. Therefore, CSF has a great epizootiological and economic importance to the swine production, primarily because of trade restrictions for live pigs and pork products. CSF eradication and control programmes are generally based on vaccination strategies in countries with endemic occurrence of CSF or non-vaccination policies in contries wich successfully eradicated or are free of CSF. Whatever the general eradication stategy is in place, in the case of an outbreak of CSF the stamping-out method is used for suppression and eradication of the disease, with strict implementation of specific veterinary-sanitary measures in the <b>infected</b> and surveillance <b>zones,</b> clearly defined by legal provisions. In the period before 2006, there were certain regions in Serbia where CSF occurred almost every year, including regions where pig farming was not the primary branch of animal husbandry. Pig identification and implementation of vaccination, as well as the control of trade of pigs from infected areas to other parts of the country were not very successful. Due to the serious losses inflicted by the disease, a new Programme of CSF control was adopted in 2006, which inter alia included the obligatory identification of pigs, registration of pig holdings and free of charge vaccination of all susceptible animals in the country, as well as the implementation of other statutory measures, including obligatory evidence of veterinary activities in the national Veterinary information system. The results obtained in the period after the implementation of the Programme of CSF control (2007, 2008 and 2009) indicate a positive impact on the reduction of outbreaks of CSF, as well as on the reduction of prevalence (p< 0. 001). Also, the effectiveness of vaccination of pigs in 2007 compared to the period before and after the implementation of the Programme was the highest (97. 78 %), as well as the costs of its implementation...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{ammonium}} transporters of the AMT 1 {{family are}} involved in N-uptake from the soil and ammonium transport, and recycling within the plant. Although AMT 1 genes {{are known to be}} expressed in nitrogen-fixing nodules of legumes, their precise roles in this specialized organ remain unknown. We have taken a reverse-genetic approach to decipher the physiological role of LjAMT 1; 1 in Lotus japonicus nodules. LjAMT 1; 1 is normally expressed in both the <b>infected</b> <b>zone</b> and the vascular tissue of Lotus nodules. Inhibition of LjAMT 1; 1 gene expression, using an antisense gene construct driven by a leghemoglobin promoter resulted in a substantial reduction of LjAMT 1; 1 transcript in the infected tissue but not the vascular bundles of transgenic plants. As a result, the nitrogen-fixing activity of nodules was partially impaired and nodule number increased compared to control plants. Expression of LjAMT 1; 1 -GFP fusion protein in plant cells indicated a plasma-membrane location for the LjAMT 1; 1 protein. Taken together, the results are consistent with a role of LjAMT 1; 1 in retaining ammonium derived from symbiotic nitrogen fixation in plant cells prior to its assimilation...|$|E
40|$|The {{bone marrow}} {{constitutes}} a favorable environment for long-lived antibody-secreting plasma cells, providing blood-circulating antibody. Plasma cells are {{also present in}} mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) to mediate local frontline immunity, but how plasma cell survival there is regulated is not known. Here we report that a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) promoted survival of human upper and lower MALT plasma cells by upregulating expression of the antiapoptotic proteins bcl- 2, bcl-xL, and mcl- 1. The in situ localization of APRIL was consistent with such a prosurvival role in MALT. In upper MALT, tonsillar epithelium produced APRIL. Upon infection, APRIL production increased considerably when APRIL-secreting neutrophils recruited from the blood infiltrated the crypt epithelium. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) retained secreted APRIL in the subepithelium of the <b>infected</b> <b>zone</b> to create APRIL-rich niches, wherein IgG-producing plasma cells accumulated. In lower MALT, neutrophils were the unique source of APRIL, giving rise to similar niches for IgA-producing plasmocytes in villi of lamina propria. Furthermore, we found that mucosal humoral immunity in APRIL-deficient mice is less persistent than in WT mice. Hence, production of APRIL by inflammation-recruited neutrophils may create plasma cell niches in MALT to sustain a local antibody production...|$|E
