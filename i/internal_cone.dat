He suggested placing {{most of the}} airflow components on the propeller, {{in the form of}} a oversized propeller spinner whose outside diameter was the same as the engine. The cowl around the engine proper was greatly simplified, essentially a basic cylinder. Air entered through a small hole at the centre of the spinner, and was directed through ductwork in the spinner so it was blowing rearward along the cylinder heads. To provide enough airflow, an <b>internal</b> <b>cone</b> was placed in the centre of the hole, over the propeller hub, which was intended to compress the airflow and allow a smaller opening to be used. In theory, the tight-fitting cowling also provided some thrust due to the compression and heating of air as it flowed through the cowling.|$|E

A floodlight of angle ff is a light that projects in a (contiguous) cone of angle at most ff. A floodlight placed in a simple polygon with its apex at a vertex, aimed entirely interior to the polygon, is called a vertex floodlight; if it has angle at most ff, we will call it a vertex ff-light. We restrict each vertex to anchoring at most one floodlight. The question of illuminating a polygon with vertex floodlights was first explored in [3], in which it was established that every orthogonal polygon [...] ...|$|E

It puts in place some enabling theory that should allow further development of plot interpretation theory, {{in the context of}} the sphere-on-othogonal-cone (SOC) emitter model. This model is expected to be more suitable, for small-apex-radius emitters, than the spherical-emitter (SPH) model. First, this report shows (as expected) that use of the spherical image-potential-energy formula, rather than the planar formula, appears to make little difference to the values of calculated parameters. Second, values of the exponent n (in the SOC model) are tabulated as a function of <b>internal</b> <b>cone</b> half-angle. Third, an expression is derived for the electrostatic component of electron motive energy, in the SOC model. Finally, the results of a sample calculation are presented. This compares values of the slope correction factor σ for the SPH and SOC models, for emitter-radius values 20 nm and 5 nm. As expected, the results for the two models are similar for 20 nm, but diverge as apex radius decreases. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. At long standoff, a shaped charge {{with small}} cone angle {{will produce a}} jet with a high tip {{velocity}} and a low tail velocity, causing it to stretch and break up, so its penetration ability into multilayer metal targets is very weak, while the penetration depth of explosively formed projectiles is too low to penetrate into multilayer metal targets. On account of this, the large cone angle shaped charge, whose <b>internal</b> <b>cone</b> angle is about 100 degree, is proposed and designed in the paper. The sensitivity of penetration effect into targets to the cone angle of the liner is investigated by experiment. The results reveal that the shaped charge penetration into multilayer metal targets with large interval is more optimistic {{than that of the}} shaped charge with small cone angle and explosively formed projectiles. In numerical simulation, based on interface tracking algorithm known as markers on cell line to reconstruct material interfaces, jet penetration into metal targets is simulated in a two-dimensional multi-material Eulerian code. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental ones and also indicate the interface tracking algorithm has much better resolution for moving interfaces, especially effective for large deformation. 1...|$|E

A cylindrical buoy with and without vertical and horizontal skirts mounted at its bottom, a cone, {{as well as two}} piston-like arrangements, consisting of an <b>internal</b> floater (<b>cone</b> or cylinder) and an exterior torus, have been examined and comparatively assessed. The WEC's first-order hydrodynamic characteristics are evaluated using a linearised diffraction-radiation semi-analytical method. Axisymmetric eigenfunction expansions of the velocity potential are introduced into properly defined ring-shaped fluid regions surrounding the bodies and the potential solutions are matched at the boundaries of adjacent fluid regions by enforcing continuity of the hydrodynamic pressures and radial velocities. A dynamical model for the floaters' performance in time domain is developed that properly accounts for the floater's hydrodynamic behaviour, the coupling terms between the different modes of motion and of the power take-off mechanism.

2500|$|Boat {{building}} is another industry {{with a long}} history in Christchurch and indeed George Holloway (below) started his career building boats on Mudeford Spit. Some of the boatyards have gone, notably Tom Lack's Catamarans (Catalac), liquidated in 1986, and Robert Ives which moved to New Milton around 1982 but many boat yards are still trading including: Elkins, Strides and Purbrook-Rossiter who have been building yachts and dinghies {{on the banks of the}} Avon since 1938. Not forgetting Bob Hoare who built Olympic gold medal winning dinghies in his own back garden. Elkins built a large number of yachts including the Laurent Giles designed Vertues. When the demand for wooden boats fell, moulds for glassfibre boats were built there. Between 1976 and 1981, Fletcher Sports Boats constructed fast power boats and Evolution class yachts at the same site. In 1929 a boat was built with an innovative propulsion system, precipitated by the lack of depth in the harbour. In order to operate in shallow water it is essential to have protected screws which protrude a minimum distance below the hull. The Hotchkiss Propulsion System provided a new approach to the problem whereby water was drawn in through an intake and forced through an outlet in the stern; <b>internal,</b> rotating <b>cones</b> providing the motive power. This cone propulsion is, in a developed form, still in use today. Many of the boats built for use in the harbour were constructed with a slipper stern, a stern which slopes the 'wrong way' so the boat is longer on the waterline than above. This design helps to minimise the disturbance caused by the screw and helps reduce wash. [...] During WWII, the boatyard that was later to become Elkins, was pressed into service by the Admiralty. It produced over 200 specialised craft including 25' motor cutters and 72' landing craft. Purbrook-Rossiter also stopped their normal activities during this time to produce whalers and lifeboats. The beginning of the depression at the end of the 1980s left only a few boatbuilders trading from over 200 years of documented boatbuilding.|$|R

40|$|The single-molar implant-supported {{restoration}} {{has historically}} presented {{a challenge in}} terms of form and function. The mesiodistal dimensions of a molar exceed that of most standard implants (3. 75 to 4 mm), creating the possibility of functional overload resulting in {{the failure of the}} retaining components or the failure of the implant. 1 Another result of these dimensional discrepancies affecting molar restorations on standard implants (Figs. 1 a, 1 b, 2 a, 2 b) is unfavourable contours leading to poor esthetics and hygiene. 2 In recent years, improvements in component stability have been derived from wider implant platforms, stronger screws, higher torque forces applied to retaining screws, larger hex designs on flat-top implants and the develop-ment of internal connections such as <b>cones,</b> <b>internal</b> hex and octagon configurations and combinations of these. These improvements have contributed to greater success with molar restoration. 3 Wide-diameter implants are limited in their ability to fit in bone receptor sites that are narrow buccolingually, and there have been reports of greater crestal bone loss compared to standard-diameter implants. 1 Additionally, most single-implant restorations on wider implants still tend to loosen, resulting in component failure. 3 In the posterior region of the oral cavity, bone volume and density are often compromised. Occlusal forces are greater in this region and, with or without parafunctional habits, can easily compromise the stability of the restorations. 4 Wider-diameter implants have a genuine use in smaller molar spaces (8 to 11 mm) with a crestal width {{greater than or equal to}} 8 mm. 1 Clinical parameters governing the proposed restoration should be carefully assessed in light of the availability of implants and components that provide a myriad of options in diameter, platform configurations and prosthetic connections. 3 Many of the newer systems for these restorations are showing promising results in recent clinical trials. 3, 5, 6 Most documentation in the recent litera-ture is for the Brånemark System, Astra Tech, ITI-Straumann and Endopore, and there is some for Friadent...|$|R

The aim of this study was to evaluate by photoelastic analysis the stress distribution in the cervical and apical site of implant-abutment interface of conventional implant joints (external hex, <b>internal</b> hex and <b>cone</b> morse) and compare to the novel platform switching design. Materials and methods: It was fabricated photoelastic models using five different implant-abutment connection, one set of external hex (Alvim Ti, Neodent, Curitiba, Brazil), one set of internal hex (Full Osseotite, Biomet 3 i, Florida, USA), one cone morse set (Alvim CM, Neodent, Curitiba, Brazil), and two sets of internal hex plus platform switching concept (Alvim II Plus, Neodent, Curitiba, Brazil) (Certain Prevail, Biomet 3 i, Florida, USA). These models were submitted to two compressive loads, axial from 20 kgf (load I) and another (load II), inclined 45 ° from 10 kgf. During the qualitative analysis, digital pictures were taken from a polariscope, for each load situation. For the quantitative analyses in both situations of load, the medium, minimum and maximum in MPa values of shear strain were determined in the cervical and apical site. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the results between the different systems and between cervical and apical site were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Results: The results from qualitative analysis showed less concentration of strain in the cervical area to the internal hex plus platform switching (Certain Prevail), in both situation of load. The same results were get in the quantitative analysis, showing less stress concentrations around the implant Certain Prevail with internal hex plus the novel design (17. 9 MPa to load I and 29. 5 MPa to load II), however, without statistical significant difference between the systems. Conclusion: The minor stress concentration strongly suggest the use of platform switching design as a manner to prevent bone loss around the implant-abutment platform. Clinical Significance: From the result of this study its possible to make clinical decision for implant system which provides implant components with platform switching characteristics...|$|R
