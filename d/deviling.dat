25|$|Underwood first canned deviled ham in 1868 as {{a mixture}} of ground ham with seasonings; <b>deviling</b> would also be done with other meat and seafood products. This {{included}} turkey, lobster, chicken, and tongue. <b>Deviling</b> consists of adding such spices as hot sauce, cayenne pepper, Dijon mustard, or chopped chili peppers. Deviled eggs are one well-known example of this process. The devil logo was trademarked in 1870 {{and it is the}} oldest food trademark still in use in the United States.

The auto-Shakespeare merely tells Ben to edit his plays, and never even gives him a list of them. Then Ben brings him the Folio, and the author looks at the list of Plays.|$|E

Then by degrees he built up quite a large general practice of the kind known as <b>deviling.</b> Now there are few things more unsatisfactory than doing another man's work for nothing, but every case fought means knowledge gained, and what is more it is advertisement. So it came to pass that within less than two years from the date of his money misfortunes, Geoffrey Bingham's dark handsome face and square strong form became very well known in the Courts.|$|E

But just afterward, when I was hunting through the bathroom for some cotton to stop the blood, I ran onto a little fuzzy yellow duck we hung on the tree one Christmas, and I remembered she and I'd been awfully happy then--Hell.
