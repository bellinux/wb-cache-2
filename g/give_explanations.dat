25|$|The Justification Hypothesis (JH) {{is a novel}} {{proposal}} that allows for both {{the understanding of the}} evolution of culture and for identifying what makes humans distinct animals. A basic initial claim of the JH is that the process of justification is a crucial component of human mental behavior at both the individual and societal level. Unlike all other animals, humans everywhere ask for and <b>give</b> <b>explanations</b> for their actions. Arguments, debates, moral dictates, rationalizations, and excuses all involve the process of explaining why one's claims, thoughts or actions are warranted. In virtually every form of social exchange, from warfare to politics to family struggles to science, humans are constantly justifying their behavioral investments to themselves and others.|$|E

Men also divided themselves into units along military lines. Picket lines were thrown up around the plant and the town, and 24-hour shifts established. Ferries and trains were watched. Strangers were challenged to <b>give</b> <b>explanations</b> for their presence in town; if one was not forthcoming, they were escorted outside the city limits. Telegraph communications with AA locals in other cities were established {{to keep tabs on}} the company's attempts to hire replacement workers. Reporters were issued special badges which gave them safe passage through the town, but the badges were withdrawn if it was felt misleading or false information made it into the news. Tavern owners were even asked to prevent excessive drinking.|$|E

In a second view, before Noah's flood, a [...] "firmament" [...] over the earth (...) contributed to people's advanced ages.|$|E

However, he went on calmly, and the women sheltered themselves from the heat with their umbrellas and sunshades, their ears lulled by the hum of insects, and by the drone of the doctor's voice. The reader buzzed on with the history of the castle, tracing its development from a mound with a few earthworks to its condition in Norman times; he related monkish marvels connected with the spot; its resistance under Matilda to Stephen, its probable shape while a residence of King John, and the sad story of the Damsel of Brittany, sister of his victim Arthur, who was confined here in company with the two daughters of Alexander, king of Scotland. He went on to recount the confinement of Edward II. herein, previous to his murder at Berkeley, the gay doings in the reign of Elizabeth, and so downward through time to the final overthrow of the stern old pile. As he proceeded, the lecturer pointed with his finger at the various features appertaining to the date of his story, which he told with splendid vigour when he had warmed to his work, till his narrative, particularly in the conjectural and romantic parts, where it became coloured rather by the speaker's imagination than by the pigments of history, gathered together the wandering thoughts of all. It was easy for him then to meet those fair concentred eyes, when the sunshades were thrown back, and complexions forgotten, {{in the interest of the}} history. The doctor's face was then no longer criticized as a rugged boulder, a dried fig, an oak carving, or a walnut shell, but became blotted out like a mountain top in a shining haze by the nebulous pictures conjured by his tale.|$|E

40|$|Background. This article {{describes}} the outcomes of a longitudinal, multilevel observational study in which {{the relationship between the}} processes of co-operation and <b>giving</b> <b>explanations</b> was compared between classes trained in communication skills and classes that were untrained. Aims. This study examined the effects of training in basic communication skills on the processes of co-operation and <b>giving</b> <b>explanation</b> in co-operative groups. In particular, the study investigated: (a) How the processes of cooperation and <b>giving</b> <b>explanations</b> develop over time: (b) How the underlying processes of co-operation and <b>giving</b> <b>explanations</b> are related: (c) Which factors at the student and class level facilitate or hinder these processes. Sample. The study involved 192. Year 6 primary school children (mean age = 134. 3 months) who worked in four-person, mixed ability, gender-balanced groups on a social studies unit of work for 12 weeks. Results. The students in the trained classes were more co-operative and <b>gave</b> more <b>explanations</b> to each other than their peers in the untrained classes. <b>Giving</b> solicited <b>explanations</b> could be traced back to co-operation and this process was enhanced by ability. In other words, the higher the individual ability levels of the students, the more co-operation was transformed into <b>giving</b> solicited <b>explanations.</b> Furthermore, over and above the effects of student ability, the higher the class' ability level, the more <b>explanations</b> the students <b>gave.</b> Conclusion. The results of this study are useful in explaining why high-ability students benefit more from co-operative learning than low-ability students and why solicited explanations are more effective than unsolicited explanations. By opening the black box of co-operative learning, our analysis enables us to attribute the effects of co-operative learning to peer interactions with more able peers and this is promoted by class ability level. These factors have been mentioned in the literature as a possible explanation of 'contextual effects' but not investigated empirically...|$|R
