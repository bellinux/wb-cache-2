40|$|A {{research}} {{model of}} the impact of a multinational corporations' (MNC) <b>global</b> strategic <b>orientation</b> on <b>global</b> IT infrastructure was developed using global integration, or {{the degree to which a}} global strategy is actually implemented, as a mediator. A "matched pair" survey of 94 MNCs was conducted (two respondents per firm) in order to guard against common source bias. The results showed that the firms that pursue a globally oriented strategy actually enacted these strategies as indicated by a wide-variety of resource flows across national units. The role of the level of global integration as a mediator between <b>global</b> strategic <b>orientation</b> and <b>global</b> IT capabilities was empirically demonstrated. This confirms that a global strategy is not sufficient to ensure that an enabling IT infrastructure will be developed; rather it is the actual level of integration and interdependence that is achieved as a result of the strategy that drives IT infrastructure. The primary areas in which global integration was found to be closely linked to the global IT infrastructure were human resources, which significantly influenced the reach, range, support services and planning of the global IT infrastructure, and information resources which significantly influenced the planning dimension of the infrastructure. These results strongly suggest that the transfer of people among national units creates an information needs "pull" which leads to the development of better IT infrastructure and that the "push" of standardized information also contributes positively. <b>Global</b> strategic <b>orientation</b> <b>Global</b> interdependence Global IT infrastructure Global integration...|$|R

The spatial view cells are the cells that fire consistently when the monkey is looking at a certain direction in the environment; this is independent of the head direction or {{the location of the}} monkey. Also, these cells are confirmed to be spatial view cells by observing that there is minimal randomized firing of the cells without the appropriate stimulus present.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Life skills {{programs}} should {{ensure that their}} effects generalize across contexts and activities. Three studies are presented examining {{the construct validity of}} an instrument assessing <b>global</b> goal <b>orientations</b> in life in conjunction with a measure of goal orientations in physical education. It was also investigated whether the effects of <b>global</b> goal <b>orientations</b> generalize across contexts. Method: Participants were middle school students (N = 351, N = 580 and N = 658) who completed the two goal orientations instruments, measures of self-regulation, affect and beliefs at the global level of generality and specific to the physical education domain and measures of exercise and academic behaviours. Results: Multi-sample factor analysis established the factorial validity of the global goal orientations' instrument and the distinctiveness of global goals from achievement goals in physical education. Controlling for social desirability effects, the partial correlations of goal orientations in life with global intrinsic-extrinsic motivation, life satisfaction, pleasant and unpleasant affect in life, purposes of life and perceived purposes of physical education, locomotion and assessment, metacognition in physical education, exercise and academic behaviours, were in the expected direction. In general, global goals made a significant contribution to the explanation of variance of global constructs, while achievement goals in physical education made a unique contribution to the explanation of variance of physical education specific constructs. Discussion: The results support the construct validity of the instrument assessing <b>global</b> goal <b>orientations</b> in life. They also indicate that <b>global</b> goal <b>orientations</b> are distinct constructs from goal orientations in physical education. The global goal orientations' measure can be particularly useful for practitioners teaching interdisciplinary and life skill...|$|R

50|$|Traditionally HR goals {{have been}} broken into three categories: {{maintaining}} cost effectiveness, the enhancement of service for internal customers, and addressing the tactics of the business. With e-HRM there is a fourth goal added to the three categories {{and that is the}} improvement of <b>global</b> <b>orientation</b> of human resource management. HR functions that e-HRM assist with are the transactional and transformational goals. Transactional goals help reduce costs and transformational goals help the allocation of time improvement for HR professionals so that they may address more strategic issues. To add to this operational benefits have become an outcome of the implementation of e-HRM. The process of payroll is an example of this, with HR being able to have more transactions with fewer problems. E-HRM has increased efficiency and helped businesses reduce their HR staff through reducing costs and increasing the overall speed of different processes. E-HRM also has relational impacts for a business; enabling a company’s employees and managers with the ability to access HR information and increase the connectivity of all parts of the company and outside organizations. This connectivity allows for communication on a geographic level to share information and create virtual teams. And finally e-HRM creates standardization, and with standardized procedures this can ensure that an organization remains compliant with HR requirements, thus also ensuring more precise decision-making.|$|E
50|$|Meilė Lukšienė merited a lot {{as during}} the {{restoration}} of Lithuanian independence in year 1990 Lithuanian education met already having a conceptual Europe-orientated future education model. It {{was used as a}} basis to create the General Concept of Education in Lithuania (1992), which delineated the directions of the national education system development. The essential education principles chosen were humanism, democracy, national identity and renewal. The theoretical basis for education development the humanistic education paradigm, the holistic education concept was chosen. The education system was based on European culture values - personal worth, natural equality of people, freedom of consciousness, tolerance, democratic relations within society. The education was titled as the basic factor of the society development, the fundament of all social reforms, thus a task was formulated to overtake the general development of the society and be its leader. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) experts in year 1999 assessed the Lithuanian education and admitted that in Lithuania does exist a solid conceptual basis for reforms (“There is a strong conceptual foundation for reforms”) and Lithuania presents the best example of the major document - the General Concept of Education in Lithuania of 1992 - its creation and development. The main author of these works is Dr. Hab. Meilė Lukšienė. In her public and educational activities Meilė Lukšienė always was distinctive by her faith that a person has capacity to change oneself and his/her social cultural environment towards humanism. By her overall activities she modelled not only education, but also the future of the state - a modern Lithuanian nation, open society, democratic state. She considered the education of a competent person for a democratic state to be among the major goals of education. Besides, the researcher always considered competence to be not the narrow professional qualifications of the subject matter, but the overall readiness to actively operate in a society, be responsible for the life in the society, create its culture, to regularly react to the challenges of the development in the world and its changes, thus get ready for lifelong learning. The approach of M. Lukšienė is in special resound with European and <b>global</b> <b>orientation</b> of education of the 21st century and the goals of educational systems.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} adding a {{low-contrast}} texture stimulus {{that is far}} below its own detection threshold to an ambiguously oriented high-contrast texture can produce an easily perceived <b>global</b> <b>orientation.</b> When such a low-contrast (e. g., 0. 1 %) test texture and a high-contrast (e. g., 2 %) amplifier texture are interleaved, the effective strength for <b>global</b> <b>orientation</b> detection closely approximates {{the product of the}} two contrasts. Therefore, adding two ambiguous textures, an amplifier texture at 5 its threshold contrast for <b>global</b> <b>orientation</b> discrimination and a test texture at 1 / 5 its threshold contrast, produces threshold <b>global</b> <b>orientation</b> discrimination, that is, 5 amplification of the below-threshold test texture. The observed 5 amplification factors are larger than facilitation effects reported in other pattern tasks. Amplification is 11 when orientation discrimination thresholds are compared to absolute detection thresholds. For second-order textures,maximum contrast amplification is about 2. 5. A contrast gain control model is presented that accounts for 90 % of the variance in observed dVfor texture patterns of differing geometries, exposure durations, and component contrasts. In the model, very low-contrast orientations are represented by power functions of their contrasts, with an exponent greater than two. As the contrast of an amplifier texture increases beyond about 4 %, feed-forward gain control exerted by the amplifier ultimately nullifies the amplification effect and produces masking...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{competitive}} strategy emphasised by SMEs in order to cope with global competition. Design/methodology/approach – A self-administrative questionnaire was distributed to 300 potential respondents in the F&B and T&C manufacturing industries throughout Malaysia. A total of 212 respondents or small and medium enterprises returned the completed questionnaires. Data analysis was conducted using mean scores and t-tests. Findings – The SMEs have placed high emphasis on firm management, marketing and human resource management; and moderate emphasis on total innovation. On the other hand, low emphasis can be seen in some innovation elements and all <b>global</b> <b>orientation</b> indicators. Results also show that the competitive strategies between the F&B and T&C industries are significantly different in innovation and <b>global</b> <b>orientation.</b> Research limitations/implications – With greater competition in the globalised market, emphasis on firm management, marketing and human resource management are insufficient. The SMEs also should give greater priority to dynamic capabilities, especially innovation and <b>global</b> <b>orientation,</b> in order to survive in the marketplace. Originality/value – Similar emphasis on firm management, marketing and human resource management indicates that the SMEs have slim competitive advantages in these basic resources and capabilities. Therefore, the findings serve a strong signal for SMEs to step up their competitive strategies more towards improving dynamic capabilities in innovation and <b>global</b> <b>orientation...</b>|$|E

40|$|Tracking {{human body}} motions using {{inertial}} sensors {{has become a}} well-accepted method in ambulatory applications since the subject {{is not confined to}} a lab-bounded volume. However, a major drawback is the inability to estimate relative body positions over time because inertial sensor information only allows position tracking through strapdown integration, but does not provide any information about relative positions. In addition, strapdown integration inherently results in drift of the estimated position over time. We propose a novel method in which a permanent magnet combined with 3 -D magnetometers and 3 -D inertial sensors are used to estimate the <b>global</b> trunk <b>orientation</b> and relative pose of the hand with respect to the trunk. An Extended Kalman Filter is presented to fuse estimates obtained from inertial sensors with magnetic updates such that the position and orientation between the human hand and trunk as well as the <b>global</b> trunk <b>orientation</b> can be estimated robustly. This has been demonstrated in multiple experiments in which various hand tasks were performed.
