5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a <b>gasket</b> <b>material,</b> and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E
5|$|Holocaust deniers {{claim that}} Zyklon B gas {{was not used}} in the gas chambers, relying for {{evidence}} on the research of Fred A. Leuchter, who found low levels of Prussian blue in samples of the gas chamber walls and ceilings. Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings. Leuchter's negative control, a sample of <b>gasket</b> <b>material</b> taken from a different camp building, had no cyanide residue. In 1999, James Roth, the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter's samples, stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks, and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface. The surface that {{had been exposed to}} the chemical was not identified, and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount. In 1994, the Institute for Forensic Research in Kraków re-examined Leuchter's claim, stating that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction. Using microdiffusion techniques, they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers (as positive controls) and living quarters (as negative controls). They found cyanide residue in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers but none in the living quarters.|$|E

40|$|Polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane (PEM) {{fuel cell}} stack requires gaskets and seals in each cell to keep the reactant gases (hydrogen and oxygen) within their respective regions. The stability of the gaskets/seals {{is critical to the}} operating life as well as the electrochemical performance of the fuel cell. The time-dependant chemical and mechanical degradation of two commercially available silicones-based elastomeric <b>gasket</b> <b>materials</b> in a simulated fuel cell environment was investigated in this work.

25|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} to avoid contact, an effective method of material separation is required. If paints or coatings are used for isolation, they should be compatible with both metals. Bituminous or zinc chromate primers can be used between copper and aluminum. Bituminous, zinc chromate, or a red lead primer can be effective in separating copper from iron and other ferrous metals. Taping or <b>gasketing</b> with non-absorptive <b>materials</b> or sealants are effective in separating copper from all other metals. In areas with severe exposure, lead or similar <b>gasketing</b> <b>materials</b> should be used, except between copper and aluminum. Water draining from copper surfaces should be prevented from exposure to aluminum and galvanized steel as traces of copper salts may accelerate corrosion. In some cases, anodizing may protect thicker aluminum, such as aluminum window system mullions.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the more}} {{desirable}} properties of an effective gasket in industrial applications for compressed fiber <b>gasket</b> <b>material</b> {{is the ability to}} withstand high compressive loads. Most industrial gasket applications involve bolts exerting compression well into the 14 MPa (2000 psi) range or higher.

50|$|The overall {{shape of}} the sample {{assembly}} is a cube (typically around 6mm), this shape allows {{for each of the}} 6 anvils to make contact with each face of the sample assembly. The outer portion of the sample assembly is the pressure medium, which is commonly either boron epoxy (BE) or mullite. The choice of pressure medium used in the sample assembly depends on the ultimate goal of the experiment. Boron epoxy is a self gasketing material in the D-DIA, which means it can produce a seal between all the anvils during deformation, but it has been shown to impart a significant amount of water to the sample during the experiment. This added water to the sample makes it impossible to conduct rheology experiments under anhydrous conditions. The other pressure medium material, mullite, leaves the sample very dry, but does not have the ability to self-gasket in the D-DIA. For this reason, when mullite is used as a pressure medium it needs to be used in combination with a <b>gasket</b> <b>material.</b> Typically the <b>gasket</b> <b>material</b> used is pyrophyllite, and the mullite will be machined into a sphere which sits in pyrophyllite “seats”, forming a cube.|$|E

40|$|Investments in gas {{distribution}} networks are very high, exceeding worldwide {{hundreds of billions}} of euros. The replacement of pieces too early results loss of capital. However, by too late replacement safety and security of supply may be in serious danger. This project is focused in distribution pipelines, composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters and low pressure, used to take the products to the final consumer. More specifically union joints and flange gaskets are studied. In the field of gasket and seals, gaskets are generally associated with mating flanges of a mechanical joint while seals are generally associated with moving parts. Some designers refer to gaskets as static seals but this is not really true since the relationship between a gasket and its mating flanges is dynamic in nature due to the dynamic deformations associated with internal pressure, vibration, external forces and thermal expansion or contraction. The main objective of this project is the study of low pressure gaskets for gas pipelines. Some gas companies are continuously spending money and resources on improve the lifetime of their installations and achieve the regulations required. The first part of this paper is an analysis and description of gasket design, including calculation of union joints, styles of flanges and factors that affect the performance. Then a description of the common <b>gasket</b> <b>materials</b> and <b>gasket</b> configurations is done, complemented with installation advices and troubleshooting.
