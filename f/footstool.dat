25|$|Chairs were in {{existence}} {{since at least the}} Early Dynastic Period of Egypt. They were covered with cloth or leather, were made of carved wood, and were much lower than today’s chairs – chair seats were sometimes only 25cm high. In ancient Egypt chairs appear to have been of great richness and splendor. Fashioned of ebony and ivory, or of carved and gilded wood, they were covered with costly materials, magnificent patterns and supported upon representations of the legs of beasts or the figures of captives. Generally speaking, the higher ranked an individual was, the taller and more sumptuous was the chair he sat on and the greater the honor. On state occasions the pharaoh sat on a throne, often with a little <b>footstool</b> in front of it.|$|E
25|$|The first {{tapestries}} {{were brought}} by Queen Bona Sforza as her wedding dowry. Then in 1526 and 1533, Sigismund I the Old ordered 108 fabrics in Antwerp and Bruges. Most of the tapestries, however, were commissioned by king Sigismund II Augustus in Brussels in the workshops of Willem and Jan de Kempeneer, Jan van Tieghem and Nicolas Leyniers between 1550-1565. Initially, {{there were about}} 170 tapestries in the royal collection, among them 84 black-and-white tapestries with the royal crest and the letters SA, 8 tapestries which Sigismund I the Old had been received from the Emperor Maximilian I, and others, gifts from foreign delegations. The gifts include one tapestry with the Polish eagle bearing the date 1560, the royal initials and the letters CKCH (Christophorus Krupski Capitaneus Horodlo) next to the Korczak coat of arms and the inscription SCABELLVM PEDVM TVORVM (the <b>footstool</b> under your feet, Psalm 110, A Psalm of David), a gift from Krzysztof Krupski, starost of Horodło for Sigismund Augustus. The tapestries had been displayed publicly {{for the first time}} during the wedding of king Sigismund Augustus with Catherine of Austria. To this day, preserved about 138 of which exposed are about 30. They were matched in size to the walls and some of them reach the size of 5 × 9 m (5.47 × 9.84 yd). The tapestries were made of wool strands, silk and gold and woven on looms with a density of about 8 - 10 warp threads per centimeter.|$|E

[...] National symbols such as the cariñosa, carabao, bangus (milkfish), and anahaw (<b>footstool</b> palm) that are circulating through various sources have no official status and have not established by law. According to Nestor Castro, a Filipino cultural anthropologist, most of these unofficial symbols were passed on as tradition in schools every start {{of the school year}} when students were asked to buy posters containing the supposed national symbols. While official national symbols are declared through law, Castro and National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) Section Chief Teodoro Atienza considered that the public must be consulted first before declaration of national symbol.|$|E

2500|$|In determinative compounds, {{however, the}} {{relationship}} is not attributive. For example, a <b>footstool</b> is not {{a particular type of}} stool that is like a foot. Rather, it is a stool for one's foot or feet. (It can be used for sitting on, but that is not its primary purpose.) In a similar manner, an office manager is the manager of an office, an armchair is a chair with arms, and a raincoat is a coat against the rain. These relationships, which are expressed by prepositions in English, would be expressed by grammatical case in other languages.

2500|$|Comfort was {{the first}} {{priority}} of Second Empire furniture. [...] Chairs were elaborately upholstered with fringes, tassels, and expensive fabrics. [...] Tapestry work on furniture {{was very much in}} style. The structure of chairs and sofas was usually entirely hidden by the upholstery or ornamented with copper, shell, or other decorative elements. [...] Novel and exotic new materials, such as bamboo, papier-mâché, and rattan, were used {{for the first time in}} European furniture, along with polychrome wood, and wood painted with black lacquer. The upholstered pouffe, or <b>footstool,</b> appeared, along with the angle sofa and unusual chairs for intimate conversations between two persons (Le confident) or three people (Le indiscret).|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis {{reported}} in a Baraita that the House of Shammai taught that heaven was created first and the earth was created afterwards, as [...] says, [...] "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." [...] But the House of Hillel taught that the earth was created first and heaven was created afterwards, as [...] says, [...] "In {{the day that the}} Lord God made earth and heaven." [...] The House of Hillel faulted the House of Shammai for believing that one can build a house's upper stories and afterwards builds the house, as [...] calls heaven God's [...] "upper chambers," [...] saying, [...] "It is He Who builds His upper chambers in the heaven, and has founded His vault upon the earth." [...] The House of Shammai, in turn, faulted the House of Hillel for believing that a person builds a <b>footstool</b> first, and afterwards builds the throne, as [...] calls heaven God's throne and the earth God's <b>footstool.</b> But the Sages said that God created both heaven and earth at the same time, as [...] says, [...] "My hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has spread out the heavens: When I call to them, they stand up together." [...] The House of Shammai and the House of Hillel, however, interpreted the word [...] "together" [...] in [...] to mean only that heaven and earth cannot be separated from each another. Resh Lakish reconciled the differing verses by positing that God created heaven first, and afterwards created the earth; but when God put them in place, God put the earth in place first, and afterwards put heaven in place..|$|E
2500|$|Yahweh-worship was famously aniconic, {{meaning that}} the god was not {{depicted}} by a statue or other image. This {{is not to say}} that he was not represented in some symbolic form, and early Israelite worship probably focused on standing stones, but according to the Biblical texts the temple in Jerusalem featured Yahweh's throne in the form of two cherubim, their inner wings forming the seat and a box (the Ark of the Covenant) as a <b>footstool,</b> while the throne itself was empty. No satisfactory explanation of Israelite aniconism has been advanced, and a number of recent scholars have argued that Yahweh was in fact represented prior to the reforms of Hezekiah and Josiah late in the monarchic period: to quote one recent study, [...] "n early aniconism, de facto or otherwise, is purely a projection of the post-exilic imagination" [...] (MacDonald, 2007).|$|E

50|$|The modern word “throne” {{is derived}} from the ancient Greek thronos (Greek singular: θρόνος), which was a seat {{designated}} for deities or individuals of high status or honor. The colossal chryselephantine statue of Zeus at Olympia, constructed by Phidias and lost in antiquity, featured the god Zeus seated on an elaborate throne, which was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory, according to Pausanias. Less extravagant though more influential in later periods is the klismos (Greek singular: κλισμός), an elegant Greek chair with a curved backrest and legs whose form was copied by the Romans and is now part of the vocabulary of furniture design. A fine example is shown on the grave stele of Hegeso, dating to the late fifth century B.C.E. As with earlier furniture from the east, the klismos and thronos could be accompanied by <b>footstools.</b> There are three types of <b>footstools</b> outlined by Richter - those with plain straight legs, those with curved legs, and those shaped like boxes that would have sat directly on the ground.|$|R
2500|$|Sir John George Woodroffe, {{also known}} by his {{pseudonym}} Arthur Avalon, was a British Orientalist whose work helped to unleash in the West {{a deep and}} wide interest in Hindu philosophy and Yogic practices. Alongside his judicial duties he studied Sanskrit and Hindu philosophy and was especially interested in Hindu Tantra. He translated some twenty original Sanskrit texts and published and lectured prolifically on Indian philosophy and {{a wide range of}} Yoga and Tantra topics. Woodroffe's The Serpent Power The Secrets of Tantric and Shaktic Yoga, is a source for many modern Western adaptations of Kundalini yoga practice. It is a philosophically sophisticated commentary on, and translation of, the Satcakra-nirupana ("Description of and Investigation into the Six Bodily Centres") of Purnananda (dated around AD 1550) and the Paduka-Pancaka ("Five-fold <b>Footstool</b> of the Guru"). The term [...] "Serpent Power" [...] refers to the kundalini, an energy said to be released within an individual by meditation techniques.|$|E

5000|$|The Waltz of {{the first}} scene, or the Valse Champêtre (or the Valse Villageoise) is danced in many {{different}} versions by ballet companies today. Perhaps the only company to dance this Waltz today in Petipa's original version is the Royal Ballet. The notation documents Petipa's original choreography - one of his signature lavish dances for a massive corps de ballet. According to the notation the choreography called for forty dancers (20 men and 20 women), with sixteen of them using <b>footstools</b> painted both red and green to form geometric patterns and make various poses, with the corps de ballet at all times remaining inside the space made by the <b>footstools.</b> A Maypole was brought out toward the finale of the Waltz. One critic who saw the first performance described it: [...] "At {{the end of the}} Waltz a (Maypole) is introduced, the high point of which ribbons are dropped in sequential order: red ribbons, blue, and yellow. The dancers pick up the ends of the ribbons, forming thereby a kind of umbrella; {{it turned out to be}} quite an effective picture." ...|$|R

Other recurring themes include exotic Tree of Life patterns influenced by earlier crewelwork and chinoiserie with its fanciful imagery of an imaginary China, asymmetry in format and whimsical contrasts of scale. In contrast, needlepainting in silks and wools produced naturalistic portraits and domestic scenes.|$|R
