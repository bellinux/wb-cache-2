500|$|Although Milian was a {{songwriter}} since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, [...] "there are no rules". Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, {{where she would}} have a hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a [...] "no rules theory", which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, [...] "It was just, you know what? <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> up the melody I can do different things. Sometimes I might get stuck but wait half an hour and it'll come to you and end up being hot. So that's probably my biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new. Once I got past all that, it was just easy. With flying colors, I started writing all the records." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{experienced}} both {{avenues of}} recording {{on a major}} label and later choosing to be an independent artist, a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music. [...] He {{spends most of his}} time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works. [...] "I'm my own boss. I can do what I want. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> directions", he told West Central Tribune's Anne Polta. [...] As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said. [...] "A lot of musicians don't learn the business. You just have to be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent." [...] "I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said. [...] "It has allowed me to create CDs. It separates you from the million other great players." ...|$|E
500|$|Anarky's second costume {{was used}} during the 1999 ongoing Anarky series. It {{retained}} the red jumpsuit, gold mask, and hat, but excised the character's red robes. New additions to the costume included a red cape, a utility belt modeled after Batman's utility belt, and a single, large circle-A across the chest, akin to Superman's iconic [...] "S" [...] shield. The golden mask was also redesigned as a reflective, but flexible material that wrapped around Anarky's head, allowing for the display of facial movement and emotion. This had previously been impossible, as the first mask was made of inflexible metal. Being a relatively new creation, Breyfogle encountered no editorial resistance in the new character design: [...] "Because [...] doesn't have 50 years of merchandising behind him, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> his costume whenever I want..." [...] Within the Anarky series, secondary costumes were displayed in Anarky's base of operations. Each was slightly altered in design, but followed the same basic theme of color, jumpsuit, cloak, and hat. These were designed for use in various situations, but only one, a [...] "universal battle suit", was {{used during the}} brief series. These suits were also intended {{to be seen in}} the unpublished ninth issue of the series.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 21 years old, Zamzam Mohamed Farah was {{the only}} female athlete {{competing}} for Somalia at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She was making her first appearance in the quadrennial event. Prior to the competition, Farah spoke of her and Mohamed's training which involved running through manned militia road blocks who occasionally mistaken them for suicide bombers and threatened to shoot them. Despite this, {{she said that she}} was [...] "very much excited" [...] to compete at the Games: “I hope I will win, inshah’Allah [...] That is what I am expected to do, so that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> the narrative of Somalia.” Farah competed in the first heat of the women's 400 metre discipline on 3 August, finishing seventh and last of all runners, with a time of one minute and 20.48 seconds. She finished behind Geisa Coutinho of Brazil (53.43 seconds) and Kazakhstan's Marina Maslyonko (53.66 seconds) in a heat led by Francena McCorory of the United States (50.78 seconds). Farah finished 45th (and last) out of all runners overall, and was unable to advance into the semi-finals after finishing 28.39 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in her heat who made the later stages. After the event she was appaulded by the crowd and said: [...] "It was great to be here to participate in the Olympic Games and tell people Somalia is still here." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show usually {{concluded}} with Red giving {{a message to}} his wife, Bernice (usually a double entendre), and delivering his signature piece of life advice {{in the form of}} a hockey metaphor: [...] "Keep your stick on the ice." [...] This was followed by a general meeting of the Possum Lodge membership while the credits rolled, which began with the ritual stating of the Lodge motto: [...] "Quando omni flunkus moritati" [...] (Pseudo-Latin for [...] "When all else fails, play dead"). From season six onward, this was often followed by the Man's Prayer: [...] "I'm a man, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>change,</b> if I have to, I guess." [...] In the final episode of the series, a revised version of the prayer was said: [...] "I'm a man, but I changed, because I had to. Oh well." [...] Steve Smith later identified that this was a tribute to his wife Morag, who had simply commented, [...] "Oh well," [...] upon viewing the first episode back in 1991. In one episode, women take over Possum Lodge and change the prayer to [...] "I am woman, hear me roar. I'm in charge, get over it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{production}} meeting between U2 and their creative {{team for the}} Innocence + Experience Tour was held in March 2013. Although Songs of Innocence was still in progress {{at the time and}} did not yet have a title, the autobiographical narrative that would characterise the album was already a driving idea for their tour. The band wanted {{to tell the story of}} their adolescence in Dublin in the 1970s and how they were [...] "trying to figure out how they fit into the often violent and disrupted world outside" [...] their homes. The manifesto for the tour was summarized by two phrases: [...] "I can't change the world, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> the world in me", and [...] "I can the change the world, but I can't change the world in me." [...] The first is a lyric from the band's 1981 song [...] "Rejoice" [...] and represents the mindset of a teenage Bono feeling powerless to make a difference in a world plagued by the Troubles, who instead views personal psychological changes as a possibility; the second phrase represents the modern-day realization that the same person could make a difference in the world through philanthropic efforts but still struggle with the complexities of internal change. Devlin said, [...] "The space between these two statements is the territory of the album and of the show." [...] The band intended to stage shows in pairs and alternate the setlist between [...] "innocence" [...] and [...] "experience" [...] motifs night to night. Williams said, [...] "The artfulness in this tour is in the ideas, not the hardware".|$|E
