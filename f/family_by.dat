As Parkinson's is not a curable disease, all treatments are focused on slowing decline and improving quality of life, and are therefore palliative in nature.|$|E

5|$|The genus Pilophorus {{was until}} {{recently}} {{considered to be}} a member of the Stereocaulaceae <b>family</b> <b>by</b> some authors. Analysis of small subunit ribosomal DNA sequences showed P.acicularis to be more closely related to the Cladoniaceae, rather than the Stereocaulaceae.|$|E

A recent review suggests that Carnotaurus was not closely related with either Aucasaurus or Majungasaurus, and instead proposed Ilokelesia as its sister taxon.|$|E

5|$|According to his biographer, Lowell H. Harrison, Breckinridge {{may have}} {{attended}} school, including Augusta Academy (now Washington and Lee University), but any records containing this information have been lost. After his father's death, the younger Breckinridge helped support the <b>family</b> <b>by</b> selling whiskey, brandy, and hemp. He learned surveying from his uncle, William Preston, and between 1774 and 1779, he was {{employed as a}} recorder in the land office of Fincastle. Preston sought opportunities for his nephew to attend private schools alongside his sons, but such schools were prone to intermittent operation, and Breckinridge's other responsibilities interfered with his attendance. Preston also nominated Breckinridge as deputy surveyor of Montgomery County, a position he accepted after passing the requisite exam on February 1, 1780. Later that year, he joined his cousin, future Kentucky Senator John Brown, at William and Mary College (now College of William & Mary). The instructors who influenced him most were Reverend James Madison and George Wythe.|$|E

5|$|After a {{short time}} in jail, they are {{released}} by a social worker named Gabriel, whom Homer mistakes for an angel sent from Heaven. Gabriel moves in with the family to help them be functional again. After observing the family's quirks, Gabriel takes the family to a forest and diagnoses the family's problems accordingly: Marge tries to prove her self-worth to the <b>family</b> <b>by</b> medicating them with food, Bart is addicted to doing crazy stunts for attention, and Homer is simply a drunken buffoon. Gabriel then sets up a challenge to teach the Simpsons the importance of teamwork by setting up a picnic basket in a tree. The object is for the family to work {{together as a team}} to get it down. After a harrowing rescue involving Bart driving the family car and Homer nearly becoming prey for wild predators, the Simpsons succeed and Gabriel congratulates them on working together as a family and becoming functional during their drive home.|$|E
5|$|Aldermaston {{may have}} been {{inhabited}} as early as 1690 BCE; a number of postholes and remains of cereal grains {{have been found in}} the area. Written history of the village is traced back {{at least as far as}} the 9th century CE. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles show that the Ealdorman of Berkshire had his country estate in the village. The manor of Aldermaston was established by the early 11th century, when the village was given to the Achard <b>family</b> <b>by</b> Henry I; the manor is documented in the Domesday survey. The village church was established in the 13th century, and some of the original Norman architecture remains in the building's structure.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{have only}} had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team's foundation. It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 {{and for the first}} 28 years of its {{existence}} it was used almost exclusively by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5acre (51,000m²) site. Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears <b>family</b> <b>by</b> the noted football architect Archibald Leitch, who had also designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park. Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.|$|E
