At the suggestion of Jean Butler, Genie's special education teacher at the hospital, they screened The Wild Child during their first meeting, and the scientists later said the film had an immediate and profound impact. The huge variety of suggestions for <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> Genie made it extremely difficult for researchers to give the proposal a coherent direction.

The research team also planned to continue periodic evaluations of Genie's psychological development in various aspects of her life. From the time of her admission to Children's Hospital researchers had tried to keep her identity concealed, and it was around this time that they adopted the pseudonym Genie for her, referencing similarities between a genie coming out of a lamp without having a childhood and Genie's sudden emergence into society past childhood.|$|E

2500|$|The cubic {{was first}} partly solved by the 15th/16th-century Italian {{mathematician}} Scipione del Ferro, {{who did not}} however publish his results; this method, though, only solved one type of cubic equation. This solution was then rediscovered independently in 1535 by Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia, who shared it with Gerolamo Cardano, asking him to not publish it. Cardano then extended this to numerous other cases, using similar arguments; see more details at Cardano's method. After the discovery of Ferro's work, he felt that Tartaglia's method was no longer secret, and thus he published his solution in his 1545 Ars Magna. His student Lodovico Ferrari solved the quartic polynomial; his solution was also included in Ars Magna. In this book, however, Cardano {{does not provide a}} [...] "general formula" [...] for the solution of a cubic equation, as he had neither complex numbers at his disposal, nor the algebraic notation to be able to describe a general cubic equation.

2500|$|More than a {{half century}} ago, Mario Bauzá {{developed}} arranging in-clave to a high art. Another name for clave is guide-pattern, and that is certainly how Bauzá related to it. Bauzá taught Tito Puente, and Puente's arrangers in turn, learned from him. The techniques were passed down {{from one generation to}} the next. It's worth noting that many of the highly educated, new generation of Cuban musicians reject the idea of 3-2/2-3 clave. Both the clave genius Dafnis Prieto, and Alain Pérez, an important innovator in timba and Cuban jazz, reject the concept. Many of the younger musicians even reject the fundamental concept of [...] "clave rules." [...] Pérez states: [...] "I just don't treat the clave as a study or a profound analysis conceived around where it overlaps and where it comes in. I didn't learn it in that way" [...] (2002: web). New York-based Bobby Sanabria laments the pervasiveness of this attitude in Cuba: [...] "The lack of clave consciousness in Cuba is starting to be felt more and more where the rhythmic equilibrium established by the clave direction is being sacrificed due to lack of knowledge in <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> it from an arranging standpoint by young arrangers especially in the timba movement" [...] (2010: 251). Perhaps Juan Formell, founder of Los Van Van, summed up this contemporary Cuban clave attitude best when he said: [...] "We Cubans like to think we have clave license [...] [...] [...] and we don't feel obsessed about the clave as many others do" [...] (1999: 16). There is currently a [...] "clave schism" [...] between these two schools of thought.|$|E
2500|$|The {{state is}} {{better known as the}} {{producer}} of a number of food products such as cajeta, bread, candy, and ice cream. The best-known food product is cajeta, a soft, spreadable sweet product made with goat's milk, sugar, and flavorings. The best known place for this is Celaya. The cajeta can be flavored with vanilla, coconut, strawberry, and others; it is eaten with a spoon from the container, spread on bread, or made into candies. Another typical sweet in the state is called charamuscas. It is made with piloncillo, which is melted to form shapes. In the city of Guanajuato, one can find charamuscas in the shape of mummies. Alfeñique refers to glass sugar based candies used to form figures and is most popular for Day of the Dead. Chilacayote is a candy made from a type of melon of the same name, which is prepared by soaking pieces of the fruit in sugar solution. Handmade ice cream is a specialty of Dolores Hidalgo, made with all natural ingredients, often using recipes passed down for generations. While ice cream and ices are made {{in other parts of the}} state, these stand out because of the many unusual flavors offered such as beer, pulque, chile relleno, even shrimp and mole. [...] The Franciscans taught the indigenous <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> wheat and bake bread. Because there had already been a tradition of kneading clay for pottery, the kneading and baking of wheat bread became established quickly, adapting the original recipes to local tastes.

2500|$|With {{no prior}} {{experience}} working with the Source engine, Wreden relied heavily on information and help from wikis and forums on the Source Development Kit, teaching himself the fundamentals. Outside of Kevan Brighting's voicework, The Stanley Parable was all Wreden's work. Wreden used an open audition process to find a narrator, and found Brighting's submission to be ideal for the game. Brighting had provided his voice {{in a single pass}} for Wreden. Wreden wanted to keep the game short so as to allow players to experience all the endings without spending an excessive amount of time replaying the game. The shortness of the game would also allow him to introduce ridiculous and nonsense endings, such as [...] "and then everything was happy!", that would otherwise not insult the player as a poor reward for a completing a long game. Most of the ideas he had envisioned for the game were included though some had to be dropped due to his inability to figure out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> them within the Source engine. In one case, Wreden wanted to include a point where the player would have to press buttons as the narration and screen prompts would have said, but could not figure out how to bind keyboard input to do this, but left the element in there as a [...] "broken" [...] puzzle; he later was praised for this, as to players, this gave the impression of lacking control during the stage of narration. Despite the success of completing the game, Wreden considered the overall project [...] "grueling" [...] and stifling his career ambition, noting that his efforts became more intense once he started learning of other players' interest in the title.|$|E
