40|$|Taxpayers are {{considerably}} interested in tax planning for intergenerational transfers (<b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>gifts</b> and bequests) that minimize {{the payment of}} taxes.

This paper aims to demonstrate that if the wealth management/investment behavior of the parent is taken into consideration, tax avoidance will persist even when gifts and bequests are jointly taxed. This is because parents dislike missing an opportunity to gain investment returns from the payment of taxes on gifts that exceed the exemption level.

We use data from Japanese households who purchased a detached house in an urban area to test this strategic interaction. Considering both censoring and endogeneity of <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>gifts,</b> which are identified by information on formal care, our preferred results demonstrate that <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>gifts</b> do not significantly increase the purchase price of housing.

However, subsample analysis of young home buyers indicates that the empirical results are consistent with the literature: children who receive parental gifts tend to purchase a higher-priced dwelling. One potential explanation is that relatively young adult children are less likely to take charge of care obligations, and accordingly, parental gifts are only expected to relax their liquidity constraints.

40|$|On November 5, 1990, {{legislation}} {{of vital}} {{importance to the}} estate-planning community was enacted. Adding chapter 14 to the Internal Revenue Code (2 ̆ 2 Code 2 ̆ 2),the legislation adopted a comprehensive framework for dealing with various estate-freeze techniques, which taxpayers had been utilizing {{for the purpose of}} minimizing [...] and, in some cases, avoiding [...] transfer-tax liability. One technique explicitly targeted in the new legislation is the grantor retained income trust (the 2 ̆ 2 GRIT 2 ̆ 2). The GRIT is a variation on the <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>gift,</b> which has long been used by taxpayers as an estate-planning strategy designed to reduce transfer-tax liability. While Congress has sought to eliminate the transfer-tax advantages inherent in the making of inter vivos gifts, it has not been entirely successful. However inappropriate as a matter of policy, the <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>gift</b> remains a viable and important technique for achieving transfer-tax savings.

In this study it is argued that parents who transfer resources to their children both are altruistic and influenced by an equal division fairness norm.

The results suggest that equal divisions are intentional and weighted against altruistic motives.

40|$|We {{document}} {{an episode}} with considerable tax avoidance {{that occurred in}} Italy after 2008 when the Italian government reformed the property taxation by abolishing taxation on principal residences and increasing taxation on secondary properties. In presence of a very low <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>gift</b> tax, Italian families found it benecial to redistribute properties among their members. Dierence-in-dierence estimates indicate that property tax reform increased the probability that high-wealth donors made an inter vivos property gift by 3 percentage points and the size transferred by 4 square meters relative to less wealthy donors. Our estimates allow us to compute (back of the envelope) the amount of tax avoidance due to inter vivos transfer. The amount is around 78 million euros, or 4 percent of the annual tax revenue from principal residences...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{inequality}} {{in recent decades}} has triggered a heated debate on whether wealth transfer taxation is an appropriate countermeasure to the perpetuation of inequality. A major factor in making progress in this discussion is understanding how taxpayers respond to incentives generated by wealth transfer taxes. Using administrative tax records from Germany, this paper investigates behavioral responses to a very large transfer tax kink in the inheritance and <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>gift</b> tax schedule. We find sharp bunching of taxable inheritances and even larger bunching of taxable inter vivos gifts. However, because the kink is large, the underlying taxable inheritance and gift elasticities are moderate and amount up to 0. 11. In line {{with the notion of}} accidental bequest models, further evidence suggests that the amount of wealth bequeathed is uncertain. This may explain the small size of the inheritance elasticities. Based on the results, the present paper lends strong support to the hypothesis that wealth transfers are relatively inelastic along the intensive margin in the short term...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates when a donor is {{entitled}} to restitution for an executed <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>gift</b> made pursuant to a mistake. The causal mistake approach adopted by some leading works is considered, critiqued and rejected as a framework to analyse mistaken gifts. The central thesis {{of this paper is}} that a gift is an important transaction which engenders social bonds such as love, affection, intimacy, friendship, trust and gratitude, and these bonds influence the parties’ future conduct in the social sphere. This process has been termed as creating a moral economy. Therefore, just as it is important to protect the market economy from being subverted by the law of restitution by recognising the sanctity of contracts, it is equally essential to protect the moral economy by defending the completed gift from an overzealous application of the law of restitution. The conclusion reached is that a more appropriate analysis is to use a hybrid approach; that is, a failure of basis test and a serious mistake test in deciding when a restitutionary response ought to be ordered for a mistaken gift...|$|E
