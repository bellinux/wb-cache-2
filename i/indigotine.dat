5000|$|In 1855, Schunck {{turned his}} {{attention}} to the subject of indigo, preferring the name indigo-blue to the alternative name, <b>Indigotine.</b> He grew woad from [...] "good French woad seed", extracted the dye precursor with cold ethanol and after further processing obtained a brown syrup which he called [...] "indican". [...] "Indican" [...] was quite unstable and resisted further purification. Later he also investigated Polygonum tinctorium and believed that it contained the same [...] "indican". Only in the early years of the 20th century was it shown that Schunck's [...] "indican" [...] from woad was not the same as the indican from tropical indigo plants and Polygonum tinctorium, and it was renamed isatan, which was even later shown to be a mixture of isatan A, B and C.|$|E
50|$|Concerns over {{food safety}} led to {{numerous}} regulations throughout the world. German food regulations released in 1882 stipulated {{the exclusion of}} dangerous minerals such as arsenic, copper, chromium, lead, mercury and zinc, which were frequently used as ingredients in colorants. In contrast to today, these first laws followed the principle of a negative listing (substances not allowed for use); they were already driven by the main principles of today's food regulations all over the world, since all of these regulations follow the same goal: {{the protection of consumers}} from toxic substances and from fraud. In the United States, the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 reduced the permitted list of synthetic colors from 700 down to seven. The seven dyes initially approved were Ponceau 3R (FD&C Red No. 1), amaranth (FD&C Red No. 2), erythrosine (FD&C Red No. 3), <b>indigotine</b> (FD&C Blue No. 2), Light Green SF (FD&C Green No. 2), Naphthol yellow 1 (FD&C Yellow No. 1), and Orange 1 (FD&C Orange No. 1). Even with updated food laws, adulteration continued for many years and this, together with more recent adverse press comments on food colors and health, has continued to contribute to consumer concern about color addition to foodstuffs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Dermal {{exposure}} to xenobiotic compounds occurs {{on a daily}} basis in many humans, in intended as well as unintended ways. Serious skin problems are caused by household chemical products, mainly by strong anionic surfactants. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the suitability of two in vitro methods for evalu-ation of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) potential on skin barrier damage. Transdermal electrical conductivity (TEC) according to our design, and the method of in vitro skin permeability of <b>indigotine</b> as a chemical skin integrity marker were used. The TEC values across the skin membrane damaged with 5, 10 and 15 % aqueous SLS solutions for 1 h were 3. 92, 5. 79, and 7. 29 -fold higher respectively than the data of TEC across the intact skin membrane. The amounts of <b>indigotine</b> after 20 h permeation through the skin membrane damaged with 5, 10 and 15 % SLS were 2. 48, 4. 04, and 5. 81 -fold higher respectively than the measured amount of <b>indigotine</b> permeated through the intact skin. We consider that the measurement of TEC, especially, in combination with a suitable chemical marker can be simple, quick, safe and cost effective in vitro method for prediction the skin barrier damage not only by surfactants, but also for hazard and risk evaluation of other chemical compounds the human skin is exposed to...|$|E
40|$|Pycnoporus cinnabarinus laccase decolourisation of {{commercial}} food dyes was examined {{to determine the}} potential for using these extracellular enzymes {{in the treatment of}} dye waste. The phenolic and non-phenolic <b>indigotine</b> food dyes were decolourised by P. cinnabarinus laccase. The decolourisation rates were significantly greater when the P. cinnabarinus laccase treatment was supplemented with the commercial laccase mediator Denilite Plus. Dye decolourisation rates for the mediated P. cinnabarinus laccase treatment was equivalent to or greater than those achieved by mediated commercial Denilite laccase treatment. The non-phenolic tartrazine and brilliant blue dyes were not decolourised by either unmediated or mediated laccase treatments...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the concentration of ascorbic acid on some azo food colorant (Brilliant Black BN, Brilliant Blue FCF, Chinoline Yellow, <b>Indigotine,</b> Patent Blue V and Tartazine) degradation in the solution has been studied. Rate constant (k), time of colorant half-life (t 1 / 2), {{as well as the}} type of the kinetic reaction have been determined. The colorants and the ascorbic acid have been determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array detector (DAD) and UV-VIS spectrometry. It was found that the higher concentration of ascorbic acid leads to the higher rate constant and lower colorants half-life. The values of the rate constants are 2. 50 – 4. 25 times higher when the colorant degradation was run in the presence of 500 mg/L of ascorbic acid than {{in the case of the}} presence of 100 mg/L ascorbic acid for Brilliant Blue FCF, Chinoline Yellow, Patent Blue V and Tartazine. From the other side, the degradation of Brilliant Black BN and <b>Indigotine</b> is very fast with a total degradation for 6 – 9 days. Therefore, the rate constants for those two food colorants are much higher than for the other investigated colorants. According to the linearity of the kinetics curves (ln(c/co) v. s. time) it appeared to be first order kinetics for the interval up to 4 days.

40|$|Two {{analytical}} methods based on mass spectrometry {{were used in}} the characterisation of constituents of natural indigo prepared from the leaves of Indigofera tinctoria, and of shellfish purple prepared from the hypobranchial glandular secretions of Murex trunculus, following old recipes. On-line pyrolysis gas chromatography in the presence of hexamethyldisilazane followed by mass spectrometric analysis (Py-silylation/GC/MS), and direct exposure mass spectrometry (DE-MS), were used. Extensive fragmentation of indigoid dyes was obtained by Py-silylation/GC/MS. The following molecular markers were highlighted, which are useful for identification purposes: 1, 2 -dihydro- 3 H-indol- 3 -one for indigoid dyes, 1, 3 -dihydro- 2 H-indol- 2 -one for indirubine, and 6 -bromo- 1, 2 -dihydro- 3 H-indol- 3 -one for shellfish purple. Using DE-MS, 6, 6 ′dibromoindigotine, monobromoindigotine and <b>indigotine</b> were identified as the main components, and the presence of tyrindoxyl, one of the dye precursors, was also assesse...|$|E

40|$|Indigo carmine (also {{known as}} 5, 5 ′-indigodisulfonic acid sodium salt or <b>indigotine)</b> is a blue dye that is {{administered}} intravenously {{to examine the}} urinary tract and usually is biologically safe and inert. Indigo carmine rarely may cause adverse reactions. We treated a 66 -year-old man who had general anesthesia and radical retropubic prostatectomy for prostate cancer. He had a previous history of allergy to bee sting with nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Within 1 minute after injection of indigo carmine for evaluation of the ureters, the patient developed hypotension to 40 mmHg, severe hypoxia (the value of SpO 2 (peripheral capillary oxygen saturation) was 75 % on 40 % inspired oxygen concentration), poor air movement and bilateral diffuse wheezing on auscultation, and marked subcutaneous erythema at the upper extremities. After treatment with 100 % oxygen, epinephrine (total, 1. 5 [*]mg), hydrocortisone (100 [*]mg), diphenhydramine (50 [*]mg), albuterol nebulizer (0. 083 %), and continuous infusion of epinephrine (0. 15 [*]μg/kg/min), the vital signs became stable, and he recovered completely.

40|$|During {{the last}} years of {{research}} carried out {{on the basis of a}} financial support by MIUR, many samples have been encountered of different nature, colour, origin and physical state. In examining containers present in the Italian Archaeological depositories and Museums, we have found or we were adviced of interesting coloured materials and we were asked to identify them. The identification is sometimes rich of information about the ancient technology for preparing elaborated formulates, such as cosmetics, drugs, ointments, perfumes, pigments, lakes, dyes. Thereby, their analysis enables important passages of the production to be understood and some literary sourced to be interpreted. In examining some materials present on bones due to particular rituals of the first centuries after Christ in Aemilia, a particular identification of manganese based materials was encountered. The presence of manganese oxides can be related to the geology of the Aemilian territory. However, similar compounds are present in Etruscan tiles decorated with Egyptian blue and other pigments in Marzabotto. This fact supply information on the commerce of Egyptian blue far before Roman Empire times and the passage of manganese oxide treatment for painting to subsequent cicilizations. The necessity for ancient populations to paint testimonies of past religious or military chiefs lead to a search for materials coming from far centuries, such as Baltic amber, Egyptian blue, indigo… In places with an always more ancient chronology, such as Verucchio Aemilia, these materials are found in large amounts. It is not clear whether indigo was extracted from Isatis tinctoria or an Indigofera. Traces of saffron and <b>indigotine</b> on fictile antefissae in Cuma testifies the use of re-painting the artefacts every while, as a sign of respect for the temples. Ancient colored lipsticks contain pink ingredients, that may be purpurissum, but could be also the cheaper purpurissum puteolanum, as revealed by SERS analysis of Pompeiian samples. Residuals of precious materials are found also in small containers of the Roman ages. Smal traces of gold an a black preparation identify the knowledge of a gilding technique on alabaster, whit the black assisa applied on small spots. The ensemble of materials and their use enable an amount of knowledge to be supposed in ancient populations in order to make their life more comfortable and elegant...|$|E
40|$|The Whitaker Museum in Mozia (Sicily) conserves some funerary vessels {{coming from}} the isle’s archaic necropolis. Greek, Phoenician and Etruscan amphorae, a rich {{collection}} of jars of Birgi necropolis and also materials coming from Mozia Tofet and houses are exposed. Also jewels and weapons, amulets, scarabs and objects with original inscriptions engraved are found, as well as cosmetic and surgical instruments and fragments of inscribed stones {{coming from the}} Lilibaeum necropolis. From {{the collection of the}} Mozia Museum 77 samples from an interesting variety of containers including Unguentaria, Balsamaria, Alabastra, pyxes and shell valves were taken. The powders found in this cosmetic vessels have been analyzed by using FT-IR, micro-Raman, SERS (Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy) and XRF techniques and the results are reported in this work. The analyses carried out have shown the presence of a variety of compounds. The white powders, that are the more frequent ones, present in lead pyxes, were identified by micro-Raman as made of Cerussite PbCO 3 coming from a complete carbonatation of hydrocerussite PbCO 3 *Pb(OH) 2. This is compatible with the high chronology of the samples: instead, hydrocerussite has been identified in Pompeii samples. Its presence, confirmed by XRF measurements, can be a clear indication of cosmetic use, since {{it is well known that}} its use in mural painting is not advisable. At the time, cerussa (lead white) was employed as a foundation. Other white powders are mainly composed of calcite or aragonite: the first could come from the soil where the ancient founds were situated, the second one could derive from ground sea shells. Among white samples, but not only, TiO 2 is frequently attested. Its presence should amount to the cosmetic use of ground rocks or could come from the Mozia soil, for example if ophiolites are available in the region. Litharge, an oxide present in many containers, could derive from the alteration of cerussa, or from a proper addition, whether the yellow colour had a special meaning for the population of the site. As to the yellow pigments a yellow ochre based on goethite was found together with lepidocrocite. Among the red pigments, beloved by Phoenician people, there are cinnabar and hematite: the latter can be found as a natural compound or as a thermodegradation product from goethite. The presence of red lead chromates crocoite and phoenicocroite, two rare minerals, in a particularly precious unguentary is a singular discovery. In one sample a trace of blue material was seen, that gave the spectrum of <b>indigotine,</b> a dye extracted in the past from many plants and used for dyeing tissues and in cosmesis. Among black materials carbon is one of the most frequently attested, alongside MnO 2 (pyrolusite) and magnetite. Three samples analyzed exhibited red organic compounds, all fluorescent with normal Raman technique. By appliying a SERS technique it has been possible to record spectra relative to these red dyes, but till now, with a comparison of reference materials, it was only possible to exclude the common red such as madder, purple and kermes. Other comparisons are outstanding. In comparison with other sites, such as Pompeii, Herculaneum and Oplontis, this cosmetic powders showed a wider range of materials...|$|E
