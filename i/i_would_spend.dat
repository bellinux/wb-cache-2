In 1939, {{the family moved to}} a cottage [...] outside the village of Guiting Power in the Gloucestershire Cotswolds. As a child his father taught him how to shoot game; he later said of this experience, [...] "little did I realise <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> a lot of time, many years later , being trained in exactly that type of instinctive shooting".|$|E
2500|$|Sain {{considered}} Atrocious Virgin to {{be among}} his best work, referring to it on the Trance to the Sun Bandcamp website as their [...] "gothic-psychedelia magnum opus". In 2002, he commented on the experience: [...] "In the studio, {{it would take me}} typically 3 weeks to finish a Trance To The Sun song; and in that 3 week period <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> anywhere from 80 to 180 hours. I kind of logged my studio time. To do that kind of studio work by yourself, you have to take careful notes. And on the last Trance To The Sun album there's a song called [...] "Map of the Lost" [...] which set the all time record at 180 hours. [...] "Map of The Lost" [...] {{is one of the greatest}} pieces I've ever come up with. The reason it took so long is because it went through several mutilations before reaching a final stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In particular, {{soon after}} Robert South Barrett, Jr., {{the first of}} their six children, was born in Richmond, Virginia, a young {{unmarried}} woman with her own child begged for help at their door. The Barretts provided the {{young woman with a}} meal and listened as she told of being deserted by a man who had promised marriage. Barrett recognized the similarities between herself and the young woman, and concluded that only luck separated her from the young woman in her home; one of them {{had fallen in love with}} a [...] "good" [...] man and one with a [...] "bad" [...] one. Furthermore, from her own experiences as a slaveholder and with Jim Crow laws, Barrett also realized how spirits could be broken by degradation. Profoundly moved by her new-found bond with this [...] "fallen" [...] woman, she vowed, [...] "By the power of God that rules the Universe, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> my life trying to wipe out some of the inequalities that were meted out to my sisters who were so helpless to help themselves." ...|$|E

5000|$|This {{classification}} is {{the most}} severe level of celebrity worship. Often, it is expressed by statements like “If someone gave me one thousand dollars, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> consider <b>spending</b> it on a sanitary napkin used by my favorite celebrity.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Rob Reiner {{said in a}} 2014 {{interview}} about his on- and off-screen chemistry with O'Connor, [...] "We did over 200 shows {{in front of a}} live audience. So I learned a lot about what audiences like, what they don't like, how stories are structured. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> {{a lot of time in}} the writing room and I actually wrote some scripts. And from Carroll O'Connor I learned a lot about how you perform and how important the script and story are for the actors. So the actor doesn't have to push things. You can let the story and the dialogue support you if it's good. I had great people around me and I took from all the people who were around." [...] He also stated, when he compared Carroll O'Connor's character to his acting mentor's real-life persona: [...] "Carroll O'Connor brought his humanity to the character even though he had these abhorrent views. He's still a feeling, human being. He loved his wife even though he acted the way he did, and he loved his daughter. Those things come out. I don't think anybody's all good or all bad." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{would have}} done more if I could," [...] Chigron said. [...] "Your father's son has the highest claims upon me, and were it to half my fortune <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> it {{to carry out the}} last wishes that Ameres {{expressed}} to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not, dearest, {{but when}} the Lord's time comes we {{must be ready to}} answer to our names. If I am to go now <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> the few hours that remain to me {{listening}} to your sweet voice reading the Master's Word." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{can never}} resurrect the L. A. L. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>spend</b> {{any more money}} on that book. You spoke, a while back, of trying to start it up again as a {{preparation}} to disposing of it, {{but we are not}} in shape to venture that, <b>I</b> think. It <b>would</b> require more borrowing, and we must not do that.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had almost}} made my {{arrangements}} for quitting the neighborhood," [...] said he, after a pause; [...] "nor can I shorten the week longer which I {{had promised to}} spend with my very kind friend, the Warden. Yet your Lordship's kindness offers we a great temptation, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> gladly <b>spend</b> the next ensuing week at Braithwaite Hall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can understand," [...] he said, [...] "that {{you find}} my {{presence}} a little unwelcome. I need scarcely {{say that this}} is not a visit of courtesy. You know very well that willingly <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never <b>spend</b> a moment under the same roof as you. I am here to speak a few plain words, to which you will do well to listen." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> {{long hours}} upon my knees in prayer and meditation. And remembering how others {{in such case}} as mine had known the great boon and blessing of heavenly visions, I prayed and hoped for some such sign of grace, {{confident}} in its power to sustain me thereafter against all possible temptation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly I do," [...] Dr. Ashleigh said vehemently. [...] "Mr. Harmer {{was one of}} {{my oldest}} and my dearest friends; and even were I not so deeply {{interested}} in the discovery of the will as I am, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> every penny I have in the world in seeing his wishes carried out. You are aware {{of the nature of the}} will?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Could he!” {{cried the}} youth. “I am not rich, Mr. Lippet; far from it— I am poor, and I have been {{hoarding}} my salary {{for a purpose}} that lies near my heart; but, be fore that old man should lie one hour in a jail, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> the last cent to prevent it. Besides, he has killed two panthers, and the bounty will discharge the fine many times over.” ...|$|E
60|$|But I stood firm in {{my purpose}} to depart. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>spend</b> {{the night in}} that house. There would be a fire, burglars, I knew not what! Against all kind entreaties I urged the {{absolute}} necessity of my starting away by the very break of day, and I could not disturb a private family by any such proceeding. They saw that I was determined to go, and they allowed me to depart.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, as for that,' {{said the}} Count, 'I {{think there is}} {{something}} great in being ruined for one's friends. If I were as rich as I might have been, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>spend</b> much on myself. My wants are few; a fine house, fine carriages, fine horses, a complete wardrobe, the best opera-box, the first cook, and pocket-money; that is all I require. I have these, and I get on pretty well; but if I had a princely fortune <b>I</b> <b>would</b> make every good fellow I know quite happy.' ...|$|R
50|$|Initially Master was {{favourable}} to Parliament at {{the outbreak}} of the English Civil War, however, following the Royalist invasion of his town, Master signed over contributions to the Royal Army after Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice were quartered in his home, and he became a staunch Royalist.

60|$|Not having, then, {{to travel}} on the {{following}} day, we made up our minds to spend {{an hour or two}} in a place of concealment near the margin of this pond; and I secretly resolved that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> the whole night there with my note-book (for the moon, we knew, would be bright), and make a soft pillow of leaves on which I might drop and go to sleep when my eyes refused any longer to keep open.|$|E
60|$|There {{must have}} been days of {{friendly}} intercourse when it seemed we talked nothings and wandered and meandered among subjects, but always we had our eyes on one another. And afterwards <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> long hours in recalling and analyzing those nothings, questioning their nothingness, making out of things too submerged and impalpable for the rough drags of recollection, promises and indications. I would invent ingenious things to say, things pushing out suddenly from nothingness to extreme significance. I rehearsed a hundred declarations.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{decide in}} a few minutes," [...] he added, when Davies had told him what the cost would be. Turning towards Summers he said: [...] "There may be several more big red firs growing handy beside the river, and I mean to prevent any more {{accidents}} of this kind in future. If your employer will not reimburse me, I will bear the cost myself. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sooner <b>spend</b> my last dollar than allow any of these loafers to coerce me." ...|$|R
5000|$|In his book, Bordeaux: The Wines, The Vineyards, The Winemakers (2009) the {{well-known}} British wine writer, Oz Clarke wrote of {{his status as}} insider: [...] "If I really {{want to find out}} what's going on at the sharp end in Bordeaux, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> probably be <b>spending</b> my time with an American, Jeffrey M.

50|$|Title I - Commodities. CBO {{estimates}} that enacting title <b>I</b> <b>would</b> reduce <b>spending</b> on commodity programs by $14.3 {{billion over the}} 2014-2023 period, $3 billion to $4 billion less than under the House- and Senate- passed bills. The conference agreement, as well as both the House and Senate bills, would end fixed payments and certain other existing forms of price and income support to producers. They would all establish new programs that would require producers to choose between price supports or a guarantee {{of some of their}} expected revenue.|$|R
60|$|I {{had begun}} to {{frequent}} a club founded by Mr. Oldham, and not from natural liking, but from a secret ambition. I wished to become self-possessed, {{to be able to}} play with hostile minds as Hamlet played, to look in the lion's face, as it were, with unquivering eyelash. In Ireland harsh argument which had gone out of fashion in England was still the manner of our conversation, and at this club Unionist and Nationalist could interrupt one another and insult one another without the formal and traditional restraint of public speech. Sometimes they would change the subject & discuss Socialism, or a philosophical question, merely to discover their old passions under a new shape. I spoke easily and I thought well till some one was rude and then I would become silent or exaggerate my opinion to absurdity, or hesitate and grow confused, or be carried away myself by some party passion. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> hours afterwards going over my words and putting the wrong ones right. Discovering that I was only self-possessed with people I knew intimately, I would often go to a strange house where I knew <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> a wretched hour for schooling sake. I did not discover that Hamlet had his self-possession from no schooling but from indifference and passion conquering sweetness, and that less heroic minds can but hope it from old age.|$|E
60|$|It revived my utmost indignation to {{find that}} she was still pursued by this fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told her that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country. By degrees she led me into more {{temperate}} talk, and she told me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,--she didn't say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,--but ever did his duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a gentle heart.|$|E

6000|$|It is {{a little}} {{difficult}} {{to know what to}} do with your hands, even in your pockets, when there is nothing else there. Years ago, when my whole capital would occasionally come down to [...] "what in town the people call a bob," [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> recklessly <b>spend</b> a penny of it, merely for the sake of having the change, all in coppers, to jingle.
