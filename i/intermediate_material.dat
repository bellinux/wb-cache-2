60|$|Everyday {{observation}} shows that, of {{the bodies}} which compose the material world, some are in motion and some are, or appear to be, at rest. Of the bodies in motion, some, like the sun and stars, exhibit a constant movement, regular in amount and direction, for which no external cause appears. Others, as stones and smoke, seem also to move of themselves when external impediments are taken away. But these appear to tend to move in opposite directions: the bodies we call heavy, such as stones, downwards, and the bodies we call light, at least such as smoke and steam, upwards. And, as we further notice that the earth, below our feet, {{is made up of}} heavy matter, while the air, above our heads, is extremely light matter, it is easy to regard this fact as evidence that the lower region is the place to which heavy things tend--their proper place, in short--while the upper region is the proper place of light things; and to generalise the facts observed by saying that bodies, which are free to move, tend towards their proper places. All these seem to be natural motions, dependent on the inherent faculties, or tendencies, of bodies themselves. But there are other motions which are artificial or violent, as when a stone is thrown from the hand, or is knocked by another stone in motion. In such cases as these, for example, when a stone is cast from the hand, the distance travelled by the stone appears to depend partly on its weight and partly upon the exertion of the thrower. So that, the weight of the stone remaining the same, {{it looks as if the}} motive power communicated to it were measured by the distance to which the stone travels--as if, in other words, the power needed to send it a hundred yards was twice as great as that needed to send it fifty yards. These, apparently obvious, conclusions from the everyday appearances of rest and motion fairly represent the state of opinion upon the subject which prevailed among the ancient Greeks, and remained dominant until the age of Galileo. The publication of the 'Principia' of Newton, in 1686-7, marks the epoch at which the progress of mechanical physics had effected a complete revolution of thought on these subjects. By this time, it had been made clear that the old generalisations were either incomplete or totally erroneous; that a body, once set in motion, will continue to move in a straight line for any conceivable time or distance, unless it is interfered with; that any change of motion is proportional to the 'force' which causes it, and takes place in the direction in which that 'force' is exerted; and that, when a body in motion acts as a cause of motion on another, the latter gains as much as the former loses, and vice versâ. It is to be noted, however, that while, in contradistinction to the ancient idea of the inherent tendency to motion of bodies, the absence of any such spontaneous power of motion was accepted as a physical axiom by the moderns, the old conception virtually maintained itself is a new shape. For, in spite of Newton's well-known warning against the 'absurdity' of supposing that one body can act on another at a distance through a vacuum, the ultimate particles of matter were generally assumed to be the seats of perennial causes of motion termed 'attractive and repulsive forces,' in virtue of which, any two such particles, without any external impression of motion, or <b>intermediate</b> <b>material</b> agent, were supposed to tend to approach or remove from one another; and this view of the duality of the causes of motion is very widely held at the present day.|$|E

50|$|Most {{materials}} {{of the type}} affecting radio wave transmission over NLOS links are intermediate: they are neither good insulators nor good conductors. Radio waves incident upon an obstruction comprising a thin <b>intermediate</b> <b>material</b> are partly reflected at both the incident and exit boundaries and partly absorbed, depending on the thickness. If the obstruction is thick enough the radio wave might be completely absorbed. Because of the absorption, these are often called lossy materials, although the degree of loss is usually extremely variable and often very dependent {{on the level of}} moisture present. They are often heterogeneous and comprise a mixture of materials with various degrees of conductor and insulator properties. Such examples are hills, valley sides, mountains (with substantial vegetation) and buildings constructed from stone, brick or concrete but without reinforced steel. The thicker they are the greater the loss. For example, a wall absorbs much less RF power from a normally incident wave than a building constructed from the same material.|$|E

40|$|III-V {{thin film}} solar cells attract large {{interest}} among {{the scientific community}} as a highly efficient solar energy source. High cost of the III-V materials, however, is the fundamental limitation for using these materials as a household energy source. Integrating these materials on low cost and large area Si wafer both for photovoltaic and photonics application is a field of research that draw intense attention of the scientific community. The fundamental challenge to fabricate III-V materials directly on silicon wafers arises from the disparity in polarity, large lattice and thermal mismatch between the III-V semiconductors and Si. In this work, we introduce a method to synthesize polycrystalline InP directly on silicon wafer by using In 2 O 3 or In as <b>intermediate</b> <b>material.</b> The crystal quality and conversion degree of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>material</b> and the final poly-InP were analyzed by Powder X-ray Diffraction. Depending {{on the type of}} the <b>intermediate</b> <b>material</b> and substrate orientation (Si (100) or Si (111)), the crystallite size was found to be varying from 739 to 887 nm. The surface morphology of poly-InP was studied by using Atomic Force Microscopy. The root mean square surface roughness of the InP thin film was found to be varying from 314 to 1944 nm. Structural and optical qualities of intrinsic and sulfur doped InP layers were compared at different growth conditions (growth time, growth temperature, PH 3 source flow), <b>intermediate</b> <b>material</b> type(In 2 O 3 and In) and substrate type (Si (100) and Si (111)). Within the investigated experimental parameter range, the higher PH 3 source flow at longer growth time improved the structural quality of InP layer grown on In 2 O 3 coated on silicon substrate, which also result in good optical quality. Comparison of structural and optical qualities of InP grown from In and indium oxide precoated substrates show that the former gave better quality InP. These achievements will be helpful in the realization of the high efficiency III-V solar cell on silicon substrate as a low cost option...|$|E

The thermal properties of the starches, including onset temperature (T[subscript] o), peak temperature, gelatinization temperature range, and enthalpy ([delta]H) of gelatinization and retrogradation and percentage of retrogradation, were determined by differential scanning calorimetry. A Voland-Stevens texture analyzer {{was used to measure}} gel strength. Double mutants generally had higher T[subscript] o and [delta]H for gelatinization and lower T[subscript] o for retrogradation, and lower gel strength measurements than those of single mutants. Sixteen mutant genotypes along with the normal genotype were selected for characterization of their fine structures and physicochemical properties. Each genotype exhibited different elution patterns of its native and isoamylase-debranched starches by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and showed distinctive morphology revealed by scanning electron microscopy. The amylose-extender (ae), dull- 1 (du 1), and sugary- 1 (su 1) genes were associated with increased amounts of amylose and <b>intermediate</b> <b>materials,</b> whereas the waxy (wx) gene produced starch with essentially 100 % amylopectin. The discrepancy in amylose percentage by using GPC and iodine affinity in some genotypes may have resulted from the presence of a large amount of <b>intermediate</b> <b>materials</b> in those starches. The mutants containing the ae gene had low amounts of branching in the amylopectin; mutants containing the du 1 and/or su 1 genes had a high amount of branching.
