30|$|The zeta {{potential}} measurement helps in predicting emulsion stability by predicting {{the tendency of}} the emulsion to coalesce or flocculate. It characterizes distance between the emulsion droplets by calculating the electric charge {{on the surface of}} droplets. A <b>higher</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the {{zeta potential}} (either negative or positive) is interpreted as meaning there is higher charge on the droplets, which results in greater chances of them repelling each other and avoiding coalescence and flocculation. A lesser charge on the droplets allows them to come closer and coalesce/flocculate (Jha et al. 2015). Figure  4 summarizes the effect on zeta potential of O/W emulsions with increasing surfactant concentration. It was observed that the absolute value of zeta potential increased from 44.3 to 71.2  mV as the surfactant concentration increased from 1 wt% to 3 wt% in the emulsion. These results suggest that with an increase in the surfactant concentration, the charge concentration on emulsion droplets also increased which led to production of a stable emulsion.|$|E
30|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} options are available for governments to employ to try to decrease residential water demand. One option {{is to increase the}} price of water. A previous research study by Abu Qdais and Al Nassay provides an indication of how nationals and non-nationals might respond to changes in domestic water prices in Abu Dhabi in the short term [8]. Based on a short-term study of 90 households, they determined that in Abu Dhabi City, the price elasticity of water (in other words, the percent change in water quantity demanded in response to the percent change in water price) is − 0.072 (standard deviation (SD)[*]=[*] 0.0089). This elasticity is low, which is consistent with previous research showing that residential water demand is comparatively inelastic, for three reasons: (1) there is no close substitute for water in most of its uses, (2) the amount spent on water is a relatively small fraction of the typical household budget, and (3) water is often jointly demanded with some other good or service [18]. Nonetheless, as this study and others have demonstrated, financial incentives can reduce water demand. Furthermore, over the longer term, one would expect to see a <b>higher</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> elasticity - and thus further reductions in water use - in response to a financial incentive.|$|E

Using data over a six-year period (1998 - 2003), mean soundings were gener-ated to operationally distinguish between wet microburst event and non-event days. A composite of summer month mean soundings was generated to illustrate the effects of seasonal progression on the regional thermal and mois-ture vertical profiles.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the data about body condition of cows and assess the relationship between changes of health status of the mammary gland, milk production and quality of cow´s milk. The monitoring {{took place in a}} selected company from October 2015 to September 2016 with the Czech spotted cattle. The body condition scoring was monitored within the herd, with the monthly evaluation of data, during the milking in the morning, together with the production performance control. The data values, received out of production performance control, were used for milk production performance (amount of milked milk, % fat, % protein, % lactose, SCC). Then the data about reproduction of the monitored herd were used, so as the order of lactation, date of the last calving and age. Total of 482 cows were monitored. During evaluation of the condition score, the average level of cows body condition was detected with value of 2, 18. Minimal body condition, during the monitored period, was 1. 25, the maximum was 3. 75. Correlation analysis {{of the relationship between the}} form and amount of the milked milk showed a negative correlation (- 0. 21). Furthermore the quality of milk was monitored. The amount of fat in milk, within the monitored herd, was 4. 16 % and 3. 63 % of protein. The fat was found to be the component, which the cow´s form had the effect on, with value: r = 0. 14. The most affected component by the form was protein (0. 28). A slight influence of pregnancy with Rf value = 0. 06 arose too. Next evaluated indicator of milk quality was somatic cell count (SSC). The influence of the form, on SSC, was moderately significant (- 0. 05). The average somatic cell count, during the monitored period, was 287. 75 thousand per milliliter. The prolificacy within the herd appears to be inconvenient. Within the population of the herd, the herd showed to be better at pregnancy rate after the first insemination (46. 7 %), however after all inseminations it proved to be weaker (44 %). Subsequently the effect of three factors was evaluated: the day of pregnancy, the day of calving and the age in days at form. For dairy cows, at first lactation, there was found one significant influence the age, with the value of the correlation coefficient 0. 23, while the cows at higher lactation showed to be influenced by all three of these factors. The dependence between the pregnancy day and the BCS is expressed as a negative (- 0. 06) but very weak. <b>Higher</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the correlation coefficient was observed between the age, in days, and BCS (- 0. 14).

40|$|Wind turbine {{foundations}} {{are subject}} to large dynamic wind loads. The horizontal wind loads create large shear forces and moments on the foundation, which may result in critical {{issues related to the}} stability and deformation of wind turbine generator (WTG) system. This study reviews and collects information about WTG foundations, soil dynamic properties, and foundation vibration theories for the dynamic analysis of WTG foundations. This study focuses on the measurement of dynamic soil properties of soil from a WTG site. Resonant column tests are used to establish shear modulus reduction and damping curves at small to medium strains. Procedures used in the laboratory testing are also described. The apparatus yielded reasonable and reliable test results that are consistent with available published results and models. Because of the heterogeneity of foundation soil under a large WTG foundation, the state of stress and strain history under WTG foundations are expected to be non-uniform; thus, three soil samples from different locations under one WTG turbine are dynamically characterized. Resonant column tests were conducted under different environmental conditions, and the effects of environmental parameters on soil dynamic properties are reported in this thesis. Resonant column testing allowed for the accurate measurement of shear modulus reduction and absolute shear modulus value of the soil specimens. Thus, with representative site soil, such as an undisturbed soil specimen, the resonant column will yield an accurate estimate of the shear modulus of the foundation soil at the field state of stress and strain history. Test results showed that shear modulus reduction curves of soils from different locations under the WTG foundation are significantly different. Soils from the south part of the WTG foundation showed a higher rate of reduction than soil from the north part of the WTG foundation. At the highest shear strain level, 3 � 10 - 5, recorded during one year of field observation (Yilmaz, 2014), the shear modulus reduction for three tested soils were 14 %, 24 % and 42 %. In addition, the soil from the north part of the foundation had a <b>higher</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> maximum shear modulus, G 0 52 MPa while the shear modulus of soil from south was 42 MPa. The highest absolute shear modulus value of 88 MPa was from soil cuttings from advancement of the borings for the strain gauge placement. Strain history has a significant influence on soil dynamic properties. Three different loading paths were studied. Results indicate that large shear strain history temporarily decreases shear modulus at all strain levels but increases the low strain shear modulus (G 0) in the long term. Comparison of virgin(intact soil specimen) and large strain experienced shear modulus reduction curves inferred that the soil is able to record the largest strain in history. The number of dynamic loading cycles reduced the shear modulus of the soil slightly, which is about 2 MPa, but it has no overall effect on shear modulus reduction curves. An increase in confining pressure resulted in an increase of shear modulus at small to medium shear strain level; however, confining pressure had a very limited effect on normalized shear modulus reduction curves for the tested foundation soils. Linear threshold shear strain tends to decrease with increase in confining pressure and to increase with increase of deviator stresses. These results indicate that state of stress affects the threshold shear strain of the tested specimens. The study of some of the environmental parameters (confining pressure, state of stress, shear strain history etc.) helps us understand how dynamic soil properties change with design conditions and let us develop a more reliable shear modulus estimation. One year of real-time field strain gauge records (from Yilmaz (2014)) shows that the shear strain of foundation soil falls within the range (10 - 6 to 10 - 4) of shear modulus reduction curves that is built by resonant column. Shear modulus reduction curves measured in the lab may be combined with real site information to provide an accurate estimation of foundation response to wind actions or to calibrate vibration equations specifically suitable to the wind turbine foundation system. These results show that there may be large variations in the dynamic properties of soils within a single foundation site and these results may challenge the models used {{in the design of the}} dynamic foundation systems...|$|E

40|$|History {{shows us}} that {{refrigerant}} choice was never easy, with an evolvement from natural refrigerants to synthesized refrigerants, and maybe back to natural ones. Pursuing alternative substance or technology with zero ozone depleting potential (ODP) once was the priority concern of governments and manufacturers and {{was regarded as a}} long-term solution {{and the best way to}} protect the environment since the Montreal Protocol has been enforced to phase out all ozone depleting refrigerants that have been commonly used in air-conditioning. While the consequence of Climate Change issue is better known today, this argument will be challenged because of future sustainability concerns, and to be more precisely, refrigerant selections anticipate the need to mitigate greenhouse effect as well. Manufacturers have commercialized more than 50 new refrigerants (including blends) in the last decade, and they are examining additional candidates. There is no general rule governing the selection of refrigerants. But basically refrigerants are examined according to some classic criteria in thermodynamic properties, technological and economic aspects and safety and environmental factors. Many relevant research and programs are conducted and most of their concentrate on one indicator such as energy efficiency or flammability of refrigerants, or in a given appliance under some specific standards, without careful consideration of regional differences such as local climatic conditions, local regulations and standards and "cultural" criteria associated with professions, applications, customs and user training levels. Unfortunately no current refrigerants are ideal. Furthermore, future discovery of ideal refrigerant is extremely unlikely. Thus, from the perspective of different countries, how to make an informed choice from the existing imperfect candidates remains a tough challenge. In this paper, methodologies were demonstrated to evaluate some typical refrigerants based on their performance in safety issues, environmental protection, and economic efficiency, with thermodynamic property and technology innovation incorporated from a whole country's perspective. Aiming at providing suggestions and recommendations to the national room air conditioning industry associations and also international manufacturers, the differences of local climatic conditions, technical gap, customer's use habit and environmental awareness among countries and regions are taken into consideration. Meanwhile case study of China and Japan utilizing this methodology are analyzed and compared. Additionally weighting methodology and its distance-to-target principle were also introduced briefly, as well as their important application in refrigerant selection. The results of the research showed: >In safety aspect, specific hazards from refrigerant always fall into two categories: toxicity and flammability, and their corresponding indicators TLV-TWA and HOC were chosen. Based on classification standard involving these indicators, the refrigerants currently being widely used in air conditioning industry are all categorized into group A 1, with the properties of non-flammability and low toxicity, except R 717. The HC alternatives, particularly R 290, which attract the attention of air conditioning and refrigeration industry recently, are proven to have higher flammability and accidents occurred due to their high flammability. China and Japan have showed different acceptance on the flammable refrigerants which may lead to the different refrigerant selection in the future. On one side China believes the bright future of R 290 and its risk management, while on the other hand Japan's lowest requirement in flammability is A/B 2 L. Further risk assessment is needed if flammable refrigerants are utilized in the processed of production, transportation, operation, after sales service and disposal. Moreover special training is suggested to be provided to the services suppliers and corresponding requirements are recommended to deliver the after sales services of air conditioners. >In Environmental protection aspect, Ozone depletion and global warming are the main impacts caused by refrigerants. Consequently ODP and TEWI are carefully examined and then integrated into a whole environmental indicator by utilizing weighting methodology. TEWIs in average for a whole country when using different refrigerants vary a lot. In different cases, based on many factors such as total ownership of RAC, level of technology, energy structure, use habit and local climate conditions, the best or worst performers may change. In general, Japan has a smaller TEWI value when using the same refrigerant in the similar air conditioning system, mainly due to the technical gap and favorable local climatic conditions and energy structure. In terms of Environmental indicator, there exist great differences among countries for the same refrigerant. Despite the <b>higher</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> TEWI and ODs emission by a Chinese room air conditioning system, the relative value of environmental impact to a whole country that it causes is still limited due to its much larger territory area and huger population than Japan. This difference may affect the sensitivity of the national industry to environmental sector and may even lead to the final different choice in refrigerants. Basically the second generation refrigerants have a much higher value for Environmental indicators than others due to high ODP while the natural refrigerants perform well in ozone depletion impact, but differ in global warming impact due to efficiency differences. >In economic efficiency aspect, price is the first concern. Basically the more complicated the chemical structure of refrigerant is, the more expensive it is. The availability also influences the selection process. Consequently the natural refrigerants keep a favorable position other than those synthesized refrigerants in HFCs. HFO 1234 yf has a much higher cost, including refrigerant price, production cost, handling cost and patent fees than the ones being used. Additional cost is required for flammable refrigerants when taking safety measures in application and handling. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(サステイナビリティ学); 学位記番号: 修創域第 4530 号; 研究科・専攻: 新領域創成科学研究科環境学研究系サステイナビリティ学教育プログラ...|$|E

The estimated melting temperature for plasmids with σ < – 0. 05 is very significant because these temperatures for early melting are below physiological temperatures...|$|R
30|$|For each species, {{we sought}} the most parsimonious model that {{selected}} {{a subset of}} significant habitat variables from the total available pool. We used Mallows’ Cp criterion to select the most parsimonious model (Mallows 1973) because this criterion prevents multicollinearity among independent variables and guards against overfitting during the regression procedure (Cetin and Erar 2006). We selected the “best” models as those with small Cp values that closely approximated the number of parameters in a given model. We also computed the standardized partial regression coefficient (β) for each model parameter to compare {{the relative importance of}} each habitat characteristic in determining grassland bird density (Zar 1996). The <b>highest</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> β indicated which habitat characteristics had the largest influence on avian habitat selection. We used SPSS 10.0 for all statistical analyses (SPSS 1999) and present Bonferroni corrected 95 % confidence intervals where we made pairwise comparisons (Zar 1996).|$|R
40|$|A {{thorough}} {{characterization of}} many {{samples of the}} filled skutterudite compound PrOs 4 Sb 12 is provided. We find that the double superconducting transition in the specific heat Tc 1 1. 89 K and Tc 2 1. 72 K tends to appear in samples with a large residual resistivity ratio, large specific heat jump at the superconducting transition and with the <b>highest</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the specific heat above Tc 1. However, we present evidence which casts doubt on the intrinsic nature of the double superconducting transition. The ratio of the two specific heat jumps Δ C(Tc 1) /Δ C(Tc 2) shows a wide range <b>of</b> <b>values</b> on crystals from different batches but also within the same batch. This ratio was strongly reduced by polishing a sample down to 120 um. Remarkably, three samples exhibit a single sharp transition of 15 mK in width at Tc 1. 7 K. The normalized specific heat jump (C-Cnormal) /Cnormal at Tc of two of them is higher than 32...|$|R
30|$|Zeta potential, i.e., {{surface charge}} can greatly {{influence}} the particles stability in suspension through the electrostatic repulsion between the particles. It {{is also an}} important factor to determine their interaction in vivo with the cell membrane, which is usually negatively charged. In addition, from the zeta potential measurement, we can roughly know the dominated component on the particles surface. The detection of laser Doppler anemometry showed that zeta potential of docetaxel-loaded PCL/Pluronic F 68 nanoparticles was − 12.5 mV, a great increase compared with that of PCL nanoparticles, with zeta potential around − 48.7 mV. Since Pluronic F 68 is nonionic, this surface charge increase demonstrated the presence of Pluronic F 68 layer on the surface, which shifted the shear plane of the diffusive layer to a larger distance [24]. However, <b>high</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> zeta potential is necessary to ensure stability and avoid aggregation of particles. It thus could be concluded that PCL/Pluronic F 68 nanoparticles were electrically less stable than PCL nanoparticles.|$|R
40|$|Support Vector Machines (SVM) {{are playing}} an {{increasing}} role for detection problems in various engineering domains, notably in statistical signal processing, pattern recognition, image analysis, and communication systems. In this paper, {{we present a}} new method for optimizing Support Vector Machines for classification problems. An implicit reformulation of the optimization problem is proposed. The bias term {{is added to the}} primal problem formulation, which leads to eliminating the equality constraint. In order to deal with large data set problems, we propose a decomposition method, Sequential Maximum Gradient Optimization (SMGO), that relies on the selection of the working set via the search <b>of</b> the <b>highest</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the gradient. Furthermore, considering the quadratic nature of the dual problem, the optimum step-size is analytically determined. Moreover the solution, the gradient and the objective function are recursively calculated. The Gram matrix has not to be stored. SMGO is easy to implement and able to perform on large data sets. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes the {{correlation}} between the electrokinetic potential, dispersibility in solvents, surface energy and oxygen content of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) affected by functionalization. Colloidal systems consisting of CNTs with varying degrees of dispersion are prepared and characterized to evaluate CNT dispersibility and suspension stability in solvents with different polarities. The results show that an <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> zeta potential at about 25 mV is closely related to the micro- and macroscopic dispersion of CNTs, whereas a <b>high</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> 40 mV is regarded as an indication of high quality CNT dispersion with much enhanced suspension stability in solvents. The <b>absolute</b> zeta potential <b>value</b> increases consistently with increasing degree of CNT functionality, the increase being most pronounced in a hydrophilic liquid such as water. A linear correlation is established between the surface energy of a CNT film and the oxygen to carbon ratio of CNT surface. The CNT dispersibility in a liquid is determined not only by their physical states, but also by the hydrophilicity and surface functionality of CNTs, all of which are reflected by zeta potential.
