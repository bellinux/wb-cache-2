5|$|Rowling has {{expanded}} the Harry Potter universe with several short books produced for various charities. In 2001, she released Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (a purported Hogwarts textbook) and Quidditch Through the Ages (a book Harry reads for fun). Proceeds {{from the sale}} of these two books benefited the charity Comic Relief. In 2007, Rowling composed seven handwritten copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a collection of fairy tales that is featured in the final novel, one of which was auctioned {{to raise money for the}} Children's High Level Group, a fund for mentally disabled children <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> <b>countries.</b> The book was published internationally on 4 December 2008. Rowling also wrote an 800-word prequel in 2008 as part of a fundraiser organised by the bookseller Waterstones. All three of these books contain extra information about the wizarding world not included in the original novels.|$|E

40|$|How far has {{the recent}} global wave of tax reform contributed to state {{building}} <b>in</b> <b>poorer</b> <b>countries?</b> Our conclusion mirrors other general globalisation arguments: {{there are good}} things to report, but worrying problems <b>in</b> the <b>poorest</b> and most dependent countries. The reform agenda is least appropriate to those countries {{most in need of}} the state-building to which the taxation process has contributed at in other places and times.

40|$|Public finance {{pressures}} are a central {{consideration in the}} policy debate over how best to stimulate growth in developing countries. The fiscal {{pressures are}} "simple": little tax revenue and high public expenditure needs. According to IMF figures, tax revenue as a fraction of GDP is roughly half as large among developing vs. developed economies. Yet the needs for public expenditures are much higher among developing economies. The existing infrastructure <b>in</b> <b>poorer</b> <b>countries</b> (e. g. roads, telecommunications, and port facilities) is so poor as to seriously limit economic growth, as does the poor education and health of their workers. Raising tax rates in order to generate additional revenue to finance these needed expenditures, however, can induce so much shifting of economic activity into the informal sector as to undercut any revenue gains. Fiscal problems as a result seriously hamper economic growth <b>in</b> <b>poorer</b> <b>countries.</b> Section 1 explores why <b>poorer</b> <b>countries</b> collect so little tax revenue. The low tax revenue <b>in</b> <b>poorer</b> <b>countries</b> reflects a narrow tax base, largely confined to imports, natural resources, and manufacturing. One type of response to this narrow tax base, described in section 2, is to adopt any {{of a range of}} policies that shift more of th...|$|R
25|$|The Preston curve {{indicates}} that individuals born in richer countries, on average, {{can expect to}} live longer than those born <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> <b>countries.</b> However, the link between income and life expectancy flattens out. This means that at low levels of per capita income, further increases in income are associated with large gains in life expectancy, but at high levels of income, increased income has little associated change in life expectancy. In other words, if the relationship is interpreted as being causal, then there are diminishing returns to income in terms of life expectancy.|$|E
25|$|Crop {{insurance}} is purchased by agricultural producers {{to protect themselves}} against either {{the loss of their}} crops due to natural disasters. Two type of insurances are available: (1) claim-based insurances, and (2) index-based insurances. In particular <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> facing food security problems, index-based insurances offer some interesting advantages: 1) indices can be derived from globally available satellite images that correlate well with what is insured; (2) these indices can be delivered at low cost; and (3) the insurance products open up new markets that are not served by claim-based insurances.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{can reach}} the soil when {{polluted}} wastewater, sewage sludge or human excreta are used as fertilizer. Such soil is often characterized by moist and warm conditions. Therefore, the risk of using contaminated wastewater and sludge in agricultural fields is a real problem, especially <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> <b>countries,</b> where this practice is prevalent. Helminth eggs are regarded as the main biological health risk when applying sewage sludge, fecal sludge or fecal matter on agricultural soils. The eggs are the infective stage of the helminthsâ€™ life cycle for causing the disease helminthiasis.|$|E

40|$|There are {{competing}} views of how HIV/AIDS affects saving, {{and to a}} lesser extent, investment. One argument is that saving is reduced because of the disease; the other is that saving is actually increased. We find that saving is negatively impacted by the disease <b>in</b> <b>poorer</b> <b>countries</b> but increased <b>in</b> relatively wealthy countries. These results, however, do not translate through to investment. In fact, the absolute value of the impact the disease has on investment is considerably reduced for countries in all income brackets. We hypothesize that because of the significant transfer of resources from firms headquartered in relatively wealthy nations to subsidiaries and communities <b>in</b> <b>poorer</b> <b>countries</b> much of the negative impact that saving would necessarily have on investment is negated. ...|$|R

25|$|Some {{scholars}} suggest any labour {{by children}} aged 18 {{years or less}} is wrong since this encourages illiteracy, inhumane work and lower investment in human capital. Child labour, claim these activists, also leads to poor labour standards for adults, depresses the wages of adults in developing countries {{as well as the}} developed countries, and dooms the third world economies to low-skill jobs only capable of producing poor quality cheap exports. More children that work <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> <b>countries,</b> the fewer and worse-paid are the jobs for adults in these countries. In other words, there are moral and economic reasons that justify a blanket ban on labour from children aged 18 years or less, everywhere in the world.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Census Bureau view on {{the future}} of {{longevity}} is that life expectancy in the United States will be in the mid-80s by 2050 (up from 77.85 in 2006) and will top out eventually in the low 90s, barring major scientific advances that can change the rate of human aging itself, as opposed to merely treating the effects of aging as is done today. The Census Bureau also predicted that the United States would have 5.3 million people aged over 100 in 2100. The United Nations has also made projections far out into the future, up to 2300, at which point it projects that life expectancies in most developed countries will be between 100 and 106 years and still rising, though more and more slowly than before. These projections also suggest that life expectancies <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> will still be less than those in rich countries in 2300, in some cases by as much as 20 years. The UN itself mentioned that gaps in life expectancy so far in the future may well not exist, especially since the exchange of technology between rich and poor countries and the industrialization and development of poor countries may cause their life expectancies to converge fully with those of rich countries long before that point, similarly to the way life expectancies between rich and poor countries have already been converging over the last 60 years as better medicine, technology, and living conditions became accessible to many people <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> <b>countries.</b> The UN has warned that these projections are uncertain, and cautions that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate such projections.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequently}} cited indicator of gender inequality is the United Nation's Gender Inequality Index, or GII. It was adopted in 2010 because the Gender Development Index did not measure gender inequality directly. It measured female development. The Gender Empowerment Measurement was replaced as well due to its overemphasis of income. As a consequence of this methodological construction, the GEM over estimated gender inequality <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> <b>countries.</b> Consequently, the GII was adopted to address these flaws {{and to be a}} true measure of inequality and not a proxy indicator. Income is not a component of the GII and the three categories are weighed equally to present a balance assessment of gender equality. The GII covers three broad categories of female disadvantage: reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market status.|$|E
