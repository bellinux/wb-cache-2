5|$|Although {{sometimes}} <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{result of}} a single catastrophe, the Bernissart finds instead are now interpreted as recording multiple events. According to this interpretation, at least three occasions of mortality are recorded, and though numerous individuals would have died in a geologically short time span (?10–100 years), this {{does not necessarily mean}} these Iguanodon were herding animals.|$|E
5|$|Solar and lunar eclipses were {{considered}} to be especially dangerous events that could bring catastrophe upon the world. In the Dresden Codex, a solar eclipse is represented by a serpent devouring the k'in ("day") hieroglyph. Eclipses were <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> sun or moon being bitten, and lunar tables were recorded in order that the Maya might be able to predict them, and perform the appropriate ceremonies to ward off disaster.|$|E
5|$|The Dalits {{strongly}} believe in his piety and portray Brahmins as {{the root cause}} of all the misery of the Nayanar. Nandanar fits in the Dalit narrative that proves that their religiosity is on par or superior to the higher castes. They say that Nandanar was 'swallowed by God'. The sashes round Nataraja's waist are <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> legs of the saint, who merged into the god.|$|E

5|$|Ambondro was {{described}} {{on the basis of}} a fragmentary right mandible (lower jaw) with three teeth in it (Figure 1), <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> last premolar (p-last) and the first two molars (m1 and m2). It is in the collection of the University of Antananarivo as specimen UA10602. Relative to other primitive mammals, it is small. Each of the teeth has a prominent cingulum (shelf) on the inner (lingual) side. The p-last has a strong central cusp. There is a cuspule (small cusp) on the back of the tooth and probably another on the inner front corner. This tooth resembles the molars of symmetrodonts, a group of primitive mammals, but the back cusp is smaller than the metaconid of symmetrodonts.|$|E

Having destroyed the male element (Purusha) in the universe, she is left with nothing, but she is still Shakti, the female element with latent energy. Dhumavati's insatiable hunger and thirst is highlighted in many texts, and has been <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> manifestation of her unsatisfied desires.|$|E

5|$|Other sites {{show more}} circumstantial {{evidence}} of mammoth hunting, such as piled bones bearing butcher marks. Some {{of these sites}} are not closely associated with Clovis points. The Lehner Mammoth-Kill Site and the Dent Site, where multiple juvenile and adult mammoths have been found with butcher marks and in association with Clovis points, were once <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> killing of entire herds by Clovis hunters. However, isotope {{studies have shown that}} the accumulations represent individual deaths at different seasons of the year, and therefore not herds killed in single incidents. Many other such assemblages of bones with butcher marks may also represent accumulations over time, and are therefore ambiguous as evidence for large scale hunting.|$|E

Here, Chhinnamasta is <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> severed-headed one as well as the foreheaded-one. The central icon is a pindi, an abstract form of Devi. While householders worship the goddess as a form of the goddess Durga, ascetic sadhus view her as the Tantric severed-headed goddess.|$|E

5|$|A {{story from}} the Shakta Maha-Bhagavata Purana and the Brihaddharma Purana (13th century) narrates the {{creation}} of all Mahavidyas, including Chhinnamasta. The story is as follows: Sati, the daughter of Daksha, is the first wife of the god Shiva. When she and Shiva are not invited to the fire sacrifice organized by her father, she is insulted and insists on attending, despite Shiva's protests. After futile attempts to convince Shiva to grant his consent for her to attend, the enraged Sati assumes a fierce form, transforming into the Mahavidyas, who surround Shiva from the ten cardinal directions. As per the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, Chhinnamasta stands {{to the right of}} Shiva, <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> east or the west; the Brihaddharma Purana describes her as appearing to the rear of Shiva in the west.|$|E
5|$|Ambondro mahabo is a mammal {{from the}} middle Jurassic (about 167 million years ago) of Madagascar. The only species of the genus Ambondro, it is known from a fragmentary lower jaw with three teeth, <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> last premolar and the first two molars. The premolar {{consists}} of a central cusp {{with one or two}} smaller cusps and a cingulum (shelf) on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth. The molars also have such a lingual cingulum. They consist of two groups of cusps: a trigonid of three cusps at the front and a talonid with a main cusp, a smaller cusp, and a crest at the back. Features of the talonid suggest that Ambondro had tribosphenic molars, the basic arrangement of molar features also present in marsupial and placental mammals. It is the oldest known mammal with putatively tribosphenic teeth; {{at the time of its}} discovery it antedated the second oldest example by about 25 million years.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} millennium, the boar was worshipped {{as a symbol}} of virility. The Chalukya dynasty (543–753) was the first dynasty to adopt Varaha in their crest and minted coins with Varaha on it. The Gurjara-Pratihara king Mihira Bhoja (836–885 CE) assumed the title of Adi-varaha and also minted coins {{depicting}} the Varaha image. Varaha was also adopted as a part of royal insignia by the Chola (4th century BCE–1279 CE) and Vijayanagara Empires (1336–1646 CE) of South India. In Karnataka, a zoomorphic image of Varaha is found in a carving on a pillar in Aihole, which is <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Vijayanagara emblem, as it is seen along with signs of a cross marked Sun, a disc and a conch.|$|E
5|$|Interpretations of {{the figures}} varies. The twelve seated deities are taken to be the Olympians, they are one third taller than any other figure on the frieze and are {{arranged}} in two groups of six on diphroi (backless) stools, common forms of ancient furniture, {{with the exception of}} Zeus who is enthroned. Their backs are turned to what must be the culminating event of the procession E31–35; five figures (three children and two adults, and although badly corroded, the two children on the left appear to be girls bearing objects on their heads, while a third, perhaps a boy, assisting an adult who may be the archon basileus, in folding a piece of cloth. This frieze often is <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> presentation of Athena’s peplos, perhaps by the arrhephoroi, but debate exists regarding who the figures represent more than what ritual is represented.|$|E
5|$|The Kandariya Mahadeva {{temple was}} built {{during the reign}} of Vidyadhara (r. c. 1003-1035 CE). At various periods of the reign of this dynasty many famous temples {{dedicated}} to Vishnu, Shiva, Surya, Shakti of the Hindu religion and also for the Thirthankaras of Jain religion were built. Vidhyadhara, also known as Bida in the recordings of the Muslim historian Ibn-al-Athir was a powerful ruler who fought Mahmud of Ghazni in the first offensive launched by the latter in 1019. This battle was not conclusive and Mahmud had to return to Ghazni. Mahmud again waged war against Vidhyadhara in 1022. He attacked the fort of Kalinjar. The siege of the fort was unsuccessful. It was lifted and Mahmud and Vidhyadhara called a truce and parted by exchanging gifts. Vidhyadhara celebrated his success over Mahmud and other rulers by building the Kaṇḍāriyā Mahādeva Temple, dedicated to his family deity Shiva. Epigraphic inscriptions on a pilaster of the mandapa in the temple mentions the name of the builder of the temple as Virimda, which is <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> pseudonym of Vidhyadhara. Its construction is dated to the period from 1025 and 1050 AD.|$|E
