25|$|You {{always told}} us to remain <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> care of our lands. It made our hearts {{glad to hear that}} was your wish... but now, father, we see you drawing back, and we are sorry to see our father doing so without seeing the enemy. We must compare our father's conduct to a fat animal, that carries its tail upon its back, but when affrighted, it drops it between its legs and runs off.|$|E
500|$|The serious losses {{sustained}} in maintaining a static defence during June led to fractures in the German high command. On 1 July, Panzer Group West commander Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg {{had been replaced}} by Heinrich Eberbach, following disagreements with Hitler over how the campaign should be conducted. Gerd von Rundstedt, soon followed, that evening, in a telephone conversation with Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, head of OKW, von Rundstedt said [...] "Make peace, you fools." [...] Taken to task over his endorsement of von Schweppenburg's recommendation for a withdrawal, he replied [...] "If you doubt what we're doing, get up <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> over this shambles yourself". The following morning, informed that perhaps his health was [...] "no longer up to the task", von Rundstedt resigned and was succeeded as OB West by Günther von Kluge. The costly battles in and around Caen and Saint-Lô convinced both Eberbach and von Kluge that their predecessors had been correct. The Germans had suffered heavily, leading Hitler to order Army Group B to temporarily abandon big counter-attacks and go over to the defensive until more reinforcements could arrive to bolster the front.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{turned out}} of my way coming <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> the {{footpath}} that crosses the grounds. Who was the young lady that I saw entering a carriage? His daughter?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you must}} get those deer by all means," [...] he said. [...] "But about the feller that come <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> your things. He {{must have been a}} mean critter an' no mistake!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} sit down <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> a book. At five o'clock come {{down into the}} {{counting}} house. Mr. Medlin will leave at that hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Hi, there, Inez!” he called. “Come down <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> Toodlums to her mother. I’ll bet {{a button}} she’ll be jolly {{glad to see}} that kid again!” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why should I confess what I believe in?" [...] he said, {{a muffled}} drum of mutiny in his voice. [...] "The gentry came <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> our land <b>and</b> <b>took</b> our labor <b>and</b> <b>took</b> our customs. <b>And</b> now, after exploitation, a viler thing, education! They must take our dreams!" ...|$|R
6000|$|LAWTON: 'He {{went out}} without his watch. He {{thought he was}} robbed, but he wasn't. He ran after the {{supposed}} thief, our poor friend Bemis <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> Bemis's watch away, and brought it home for his own.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If that mastiff {{should come}} through the fence, it would go hard with us," [...] was Phil's comment. [...] "I'd rather stay up <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> what comes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I do. I'll stay <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> {{care of my}} runabout. If you'll tell my sister that I'm all right, that is all I want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My good lord," [...] {{answered}} Blount, [...] "Raleigh hath been <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>taken</b> {{that charge}} upon him--your train will glitter like a May morning. Marry, {{the cost is}} another question. One might keep an hospital of old soldiers at the charge of ten modern lackeys." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If only a {{ship would}} stop <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> us away!" [...] sighed Dora. To her {{it seemed like}} an age since they had landed on the seven islands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Little Flora? Not so bad {{but that}} she'll {{presently}} be better. London will set her up. Bly {{had ceased to}} agree with her. Come <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> your mutton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he mused, [...] "she wouldn't face it. The breeze hasn't fallen any, and the sea'll be steeper. Guess you'd better {{leave me}} <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> the Indian trail." ...|$|E
50|$|The shore curved round <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> a more eastern direction; and {{the bank}} of level land, which {{continued}} to run along behind it, approached very near to the water side. Three leagues further on it formed cliffs upon the coast; and a projecting part of them, which I called Point Culver, bore N. 77° E. four leagues: this was the furthest land in sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "If the Orang Blanda come <b>here,</b> Babalatchi, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> Almayer to Batavia {{to punish}} him for {{smuggling}} gunpowder, {{what will he}} do, you think?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And I'll go with you," [...] added Dick. [...] "Tom, {{you stay}} down <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> a look around. If you see {{anything}} of him blow the auto horn three times." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even so, those stores won't last forever," [...] said Dick. [...] "Yes, {{they will}} be punished enough, for there is no telling when another ship will stop <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> them away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'd better camp now, Mister Charles; there's a portage o' {{two miles}} <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> it'll <b>take</b> us till sundown {{to get the}} canoe and things over." ...|$|R
50|$|Kenkichi Oshima's {{triple jump}} win {{completed}} Japan's unbeaten streak in the event.

6000|$|... "Unless {{we choose}} to venture into the valley again flight {{is out of the}} question. We must stay <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> what the Indians care to give us when the storm clears away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{can always}} try,' {{answered}} Ciccu; 'and if times are bad {{we can come}} back <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> up wood-cutting.' So saying {{he picked up his}} bundle of sticks, and his brothers did the same.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's easy enough," [...] {{answered}} the mouse, rubbing its paws briskly. [...] "I'll just call my friend the lion; he lives <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> he'll <b>take</b> you across with pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{says the}} Man from Kansas who [...] "knows" [...] Paris, [...] "I'll get a guide right <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> he'll <b>take</b> us round <b>and</b> {{show us the}} sights." ...|$|R
