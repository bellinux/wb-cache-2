25|$|As the <b>dog</b> <b>days</b> {{of summer}} 1907 ensued, White City {{increased}} its emphases on water activities and its picnic grounds as weekly promotions not involving the mechanical rides appeared regularly in {{editions of the}} Indianapolis Star and the Indianapolis News. As the market begins to contract, White City survived the 1907 season while Wonderland almost succumbed to the competition. Only a reincorporation saved Wonderland for another season (after an infusion of new investments, and {{an expansion of the}} park's facilities, the park in eastern Indianapolis managed to stay in business until it was destroyed by fire in 1911).|$|E
500|$|... "As {{we enter}} the <b>dog</b> <b>days</b> of summer, we get the summer movie season dregs as well," [...] wrote PopMatters editor Bill Gibron, anticipating August 2013. The year's other dump period {{straddles}} summer and fall, and does not lend itself to being as clearly delineated as the winter dump months. In the past it was usually considered to include all of August and September, and in some years still may. But in years with many major summer movies, some may open on {{the first or second}} weekend of August to avoid competing with other such movies, such as Guardians of the Galaxy, the first-ever August release by Marvel Studios, which took in $94 million on the first weekend of that month in 2014. It was the most successful August opening weekend, and it became one of the year's top-grossing films.|$|E
500|$|Central to {{this story}} are Les Invisibles (The Invisible Ones), a group of seven beings worshipped by the natives of Mexico and Haiti prior {{to the arrival of}} Spanish colonists in the 16th century, {{identified}} by some fans as the Loa of the Voodoo religion. The nature of Les Invisibles is left unclear, though it is hinted that they may be extraterrestrials, or beings akin to the Great Old Ones in the works of H. P. Lovecraft. An interpretation of the lyrics of the song [...] "Astronomy" [...] by some fans suggests that the star Sirius is of particular astrological significance to Les Invisibles, with clues identifying it as their place of origin; it is during the so-called <b>Dog</b> <b>Days</b> of August, when Sirius is in conjunction with the Sun that their influence over mankind is at its apex. By subtly influencing the minds of men, the beings are said to be [...] "playing with our history as if it's a game", affecting events in world history over the course of centuries. For the three centuries after European discovery of the New World, this game plays out as the desire for gold is used to transform Spain into the dominant power in Europe, only to be usurped by England in the 17th century and later, through technology, by other nations ("Les Invisibles").|$|E

500|$|The ancient Greeks {{observed}} that the appearance of Sirius heralded the hot and dry summer and feared that it caused plants to wilt, men to weaken, and women to become aroused. Due to its brightness, Sirius would have been noted to twinkle more in the unsettled weather conditions of early summer. To Greek observers, this signified certain emanations which caused its malignant influence. Anyone suffering its effects {{was said to be}} [...] "star-struck" [...] ( [...] , astrobólētos). It was described as [...] "burning" [...] or [...] "flaming" [...] in literature. The season following the star's reappearance {{came to be known as}} the <b>dog</b> <b>days.</b> The inhabitants of the island of Ceos in the Aegean Sea would offer sacrifices to Sirius and Zeus to bring cooling breezes, and would await the reappearance of the star in summer. If it rose clear, it would portend good fortune; if it was misty or faint then it foretold (or emanated) pestilence. Coins retrieved from the island from the 3rd century BC feature dogs or stars with emanating rays, highlighting Sirius' importance. The Romans celebrated the heliacal setting of Sirius around April 25, sacrificing a dog, along with incense, wine, and a sheep, to the goddess Robigo so that the star's emanations would not cause wheat rust on wheat crops that year.|$|E

"Gassendi has well remarked," [...] says Arnauld in his Logic, [...] "that {{nothing could}} be less {{probable}} than {{the notion that the}} dog-star is the cause of the extraordinary heat which prevails in what are called the <b>dog</b> <b>days,</b> because as Sirius {{is on the other side}} of the equator, the effects of the star should be greatest at the places where it is most perpendicular, whereas the <b>dog</b> <b>days</b> here are the winter season there. Whence the inhabitants of those countries have much more reason to believe that the dog-star brings cold than we have to believe that it causes heat."] ...|$|E

60|$|When I {{heard them}} relate such things--and I am quoting their very words, remembered {{all these years}} only too well--laughingly, gloating over such memories, such a loathing and hatred possessed me that ever {{afterwards}} the very sight of these men was enough to produce a sensation of nausea, just as when in the <b>dog</b> <b>days</b> one inadvertently rides too near the putrid carcass of some large beast on the plain.|$|E

60|$|When I {{first met}} Dumps he was scurrying towards me along a sequestered country lane. It {{was in the}} <b>Dog</b> <b>Days.</b> Dust lay thick on the road; the creature's legs were remarkably short though active, and his hair being long he swept up the dust in clouds as he ran. He was yelping, and I {{observed}} that one or two stones appeared to be racing with, or after, him. The voice of an angry man also seemed to chase him, but {{the owner of the}} voice was at the moment concealed by a turn in the lane, which was bordered by high stone-walls.|$|E

I did a deed on account of it which I shall be ashamed of to my dying day. It made such an impression on me that I swore, there and then, that I'd drink nothing stronger than tea for as many years as I was old that day. I have kept my oath; and though, Farfrae, I am sometimes that dry in the <b>dog</b> <b>days</b> that I could drink a quarter-barrel to the pitching, I think o' my oath, and touch no strong drink at all." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{water was}} full of little {{floating}} particles that Teague called wild rice. I thought the lake had begun to work, like eastern lakes during <b>dog</b> <b>days.</b> It did not look propitious for fishing, but Teague reassured us. The outlet of this lake {{was the head of}} White River. We tried the outlet first, but trout were not rising there. Then we began wading and casting along a shallow bar of the lake. Teague had instructed us to cast, then drag the flies slowly {{across the surface of the}} water, in imitation of a swimming fly or bug. I tried this, and several times, when the leader was close to me and my rod far back, I had strikes. With my rod in that position I could not hook the trout. Then I cast my own way, letting the flies sink a little. To my surprise and dismay I had only a few strikes and could not hook the fish.|$|E
