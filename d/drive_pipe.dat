[...] James Townsend, President of the Seneca Oil Company, sent Drake to the site in the spring of 1858. The oil company chose the retired railway man partly because he had free use of the rail. Drake decided to drill in the manner of salt well drillers. He purchased a steam engine in Erie, Pennsylvania, to power the drill. The well was dug on an island on the Oil Creek. It took some time for the drillers to get through the layers of gravel. At 16 feet (5 m) the sides of the hole began to collapse. Those helping him began to despair, but not Drake. It was at this point that he devised the idea of a <b>drive</b> <b>pipe.</b> This cast iron pipe consisted of 10 ft joints. The pipe was driven down into the ground. At 32 feet (10 m) they struck bedrock. The drilling tools were now lowered through the pipe and steam was used to drill through the bedrock. The drilling, however, was slow. Progress was made at the rate of just three feet per day. After initial difficulty locating the necessary parts to build the well, which resulted in his well being nicknamed [...] "Drake's Folly", Drake proved successful.|$|E

40|$|Many {{existing}} deep-well {{water pumping}} {{technologies that are}} affordable to developing world smallholders suffer from reliability issues, low efficiency and/or expensive running costs. The Double-Acting Hydraulic Ram Pump (DAHR) {{has the potential to}} address these problems. An evolution of the classic hydraulic ram pump that converts kinetic energy from free-flowing water sources into a reduced flow at a much higher head, the DAHR contains virtually no moving parts or dynamic seals. The result is a deep-lift technology that can be both highly efficient and extremely reliable. This thesis investigates the potential of the DAHR, taking an initial proof-of-concept rig to a design that is ready for outdoor field trials. The beta prototype design process has been aided considerably by the development of a suite of numerical models. Like the conventional hydraulic ram, the DAHR has clearly defined acceleration and delivery phases either side of an impact event. The fluid motion during acceleration is modelled using a 1 D lumped element approach whereas the delivery phase modelling is based on the shock equations for both compression and rarefaction waves. Unlike the conventional hydraulic ram, the DAHR makes full use of the kinetic energy downstream of the impact. The numerical results facilitate the selection of <b>drive</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter, inlet/delivery valves and the choice of pipe material via the resulting sound speed. A 15 m tall test facility housed within a three storey public stairwell was set up to help simulate pumping from deep underground. The DAHR sitting in a tank at the bottom would lift water {{to the top of the}} stairwell before it was returned under gravity to complete the circuit. The driving power input to create the low pressure, high volume oscillatory flow within the DAHR U-tube is provided by two custom-made pneumatic fluidynes. The data acquired over several weeks of testing with three different plastic <b>drive</b> <b>pipe</b> materials required an automated post-processing routine capable of analysing DAHR performance impact-by-impact. Computed efficiencies of up to 75 percent were achieved while pumping 350 L/h at 32 m head. Experimental observations also showed good agreement with numerical modelling. A single-acting design, capable of fitting down a smaller borehole, was considered as an alternative way forward. A further prototype, with the second <b>drive</b> <b>pipe</b> replaced by a gas spring, was designed, built and tested in the same facility. The prototype proved substantially more difficult to control and estimated efficiency was approximately half that of the DAHR validating the original double-acting approach. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{hydraulic}} ram pump was invented over 200 {{years ago but}} became obsolete with the general availability of mains water. It is used for pumping surface water and is powered by the potential energy of the supply. Ram pumps are particularly appropriate for use in remote regions {{of the developing world}} as their construction is basic and robust and they are inexpensive and easy to install and maintain. A rational design procedure applicable to any ram pump is described in this paper. The method is based on the three non-dimensional relationships that have been found to govern ram pump behaviour. The relationships express beat frequency, quantity delivered and source capacity in terms of the independent variables. By assigning upper and lower bounds to the critical velocity in the <b>drive</b> <b>pipe,</b> it is possible to derive three characteristic pump parameters from which the dependent variables may be determined directly. These parameters all take the same numerical values within a feasible design space. The design method has been confirmed using the results of existing experiments.

Both a combustor length parameter and the bias flow rate (the mean flow through the perforated holes) were varied simultaneously using a multiple-parameter tuning scheme.

30|$|In this section, {{a casing}} design model is {{introduced}} to design casing strings for a gas {{well in the}} longwall mining area for production from the Marcellus shale. The stress/strain data are obtained using numerical modeling of ground. The data used in the completion design are obtained by using a query function, which lists the calculated parameters along a vertical line representing the gas well. The stress/strain data obtained from modeling {{are used in the}} background spreadsheet for casing design and are not accessible by users. Also, the horizontal displacement observed from the FEA model needs to be considered in the casing design modeling. For mining geometries other than the one set forth, background stress and strain data need {{to be added to the}} spreadsheet prior to undertaking casing design. There are five types of casing to be used in gas well completion in the longwall mining areas. This system was included in the base casing/completion design model. The casings include: <b>drive</b> <b>pipe,</b> aquifer casing, coal protection casing, intermediate casing, and production casing. The model is built into a spreadsheet and allows an interactive design by changing the input parameters and shows the resulting casing and well completion design parameters. Figure  7 displays the interface of inputs in this model. In the case considered in this study, the coal seam depth is fixed to 200  m (660 – 670 ft). The depth of groundwater can be varied to between 60 and 120  m (200 – 400 ft). Through the input interface in this model, users are also allowed to input safety factors, which are used to quantify the minimum strength of all casings. Then by selecting the “read safety factors” and corresponding buttons, the user can see the results for various casing sizes. Users are able to click the “start over” button to erase all input data and calculated results, and retype other groups of data as needed. For the selection of casing, four tables of casings with various minimum performance properties were put at the right side of the buttons with the name of casings. After the initial setting and data entry, the model automatically selects proper casing size and grade for the aquifer casing, coal protection casing, intermediate casing, and <b>drive</b> <b>pipe.</b> Then, the numbers of available casings will appear in the “Results” column on the left side of the input data for manual selection of feasible casings for the given geometric and ground conditions. As noted before, if the geometry of the longwall panels, including the depth, width of the panel and size of the pillars change, numerical modeling has to be performed to revise the background data on stresses and strain that should be used in the wellbore completion design program.|$|E

The negative {{skin friction}} induces an additional compressive force on the pile called the dragload as well as, an additional pile movement called the downdrag. Ignoring the effect of negative skin friction in the design of piles leads to structural, and serviceability problems. The dragload depends on various factors such as, pile characteristics (method of installation, material, and surface treatment), soil properties (shear strength and compressibility), pile–soil relative movement, and degree of consolidation. In this paper, an axisymmetric finite element model was used to simulate, and analyze the pile–soil interaction problem of negative skin friction.

Common methods used to establish resistance factors include calibration to assumed factors of safety and reliability analysis using field load test databases. Reliability analyses are the preferred tools for this work but the needed probabilistic information regarding design method uncertainty is difficult to obtain. Furthermore, field load test databases, while relatively attractive for assessing design uncertainty, are not able to discriminate between uncertainties caused by soil variability, test methods, and model design relationships. In contrast to previous efforts, this paper illustrates an approach to uncertainty assessment that seeks to isolate the various sources of uncertainty. Using this approach, reliability analysis is used to develop resistance factors for the design of <b>driven</b> <b>pipe</b> piles in sand.

In this study, the shear-induced particle migration which demonstrated that particles in suspension migrate across the streamlines from a region of a higher shear rate to a region of a lower shear rate was considered as a major possible mechanism that contributes to the formation of the lubrication layer. Leighton et al. (Leighton and Acrivos 1987 a, b) suggested phenomenological models for particle migration in non-homogeneous shear flows that typically result from spatial variation in irreversible interaction frequency and effective viscosity. Phillips et al.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by the preliminary direct numerical simulations in double-diffusive (DD) core-annular flows with slip at the wall which displayed elliptical shaped instability patterns as in a rigid pipe case; however, slip at the pipe wall delays the onset of instability {{for a range of}} parameters and increases the phase speed. This increased our curiosity to have a thorough understanding of the linear stability characteristics of the miscible DD two-fluid flow in a pipe with slip at the pipe wall. The present study, therefore, addresses the linear stability of viscosity-stratified core-annular Poiseuille flow of miscible fluids with matched density in a slippery pipe in the presence of two scalars diffusing at different rates. The physical mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of instabilities in the DD system are explained through an energy budget analysis. The differences and similarities between core-annular flow in a slippery pipe and in a plane channel with velocity slip at the walls are explored. The stability characteristics are significantly affected by the presence of slip. The diffusivity effect is non-monotonic in a DD system. A striking feature of instability is that only a band of wavenumbers is destabilized in the presence of moderate to large inertial effects. Both the longwave and shortwave are stabilized at small Reynolds numbers. Slip exhibits a dual role of stabilizing or destabilizing the flow. The preliminary direct numerical simulations confirm the predictions of the linear stability analysis.
