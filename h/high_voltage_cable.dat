50|$|Up to now, it {{has been}} almost {{impossible}} to foresee the temperature distribution along the cable route, so that the maximum applicable current load was usually set as a compromise between understanding of operation conditions and risk minimization. The availability of industrial distributed temperature sensing (DTS) systems that measure in real time temperatures all along the cable {{is a first step}} in monitoring the transmission system capacity. This monitoring solution is based on using passive optical fibers as temperature sensors, either integrated directly inside a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>cable</b> or mounted externally on the cable insulation. A solution for overhead lines is also available. In this case the optical fiber is integrated into the core of a phase wire of overhead transmission lines (OPPC). The integrated Dynamic Cable Rating (DCR) or also called Real Time Thermal Rating (RTTR) solution enables not only to continuously monitor the temperature of a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>cable</b> circuit in real time, but to safely utilize the existing network capacity to its maximum. Furthermore, it provides the ability to the operator to predict the behavior of the transmission system upon major changes made to its initial operating conditions.|$|E

50|$|All {{these types}} of {{electric}} discharges require <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> electronics and <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>cabling.</b> Those are bulky, expensive, {{and in the case}} of AC power can be very inefficient due to dielectric losses.

A construction based on multiple low-power <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> modules might improve safety aspects.
