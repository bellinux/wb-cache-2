50|$|Amstrad {{launched}} the Amstrad DMP3000 printer, {{which was an}} 80 character dot matrix printer with both IBM and Epson compatibility and boasted NLQ (Near Letter Quality) and could handle both A4 and <b>fanfold</b> <b>paper.</b> It connected to the computer via a parallel port.|$|E
50|$|The 2922-2 Terminal Printer (RPQ 810564) was a repackaged 1403 printer. The printer used a {{print chain}} and {{provided}} a page width of 132 characters using <b>fanfold</b> <b>paper.</b> The controls and indicators for the printer were located on the front panel of the Terminal Control Unit, except for a duplicate start key on {{the rear of the}} printer.|$|E
5000|$|Between C & D (1983-1990) was a Lower East Side {{quarterly}} {{literary magazine}} edited by Joel Rose and Catherine Texier. Though a geographical reference from New York City, Between C & D {{has also been}} suggested to mean [...] "between coke and dope", giving {{an indication of the}} transgressive content and ethos. Its actual tagline was [...] "Sex. Drugs. Danger. Violence. Computers.". The magazine was printed on <b>fanfold</b> computer <b>paper,</b> sold in a plastic bag and featured original artwork on each binding. [...] These limited run editions were collected by New York galleries and libraries and back issues sold on computer disk.|$|R

The {{main control panel}} is just above the desk, the paper tape reader is above it (metallic), and {{the output of the}} Teletype model BRPE paper tape punch above that (vertical slot). A storage tray for eight <b>fanfold</b> <b>paper</b> tapes is attached to the top panel. At the left is the IBM Model B typewriter modified by Soroban, and the Type 30 CRT display is to the far right.|$|E
5000|$|The three biggest {{problems}} with paper tape were: * Reliability. It was common practice to follow each mechanical copying of a tape with a manual hole-by-hole comparison.* Rewinding {{the tape was}} difficult and prone to problems. Great care was needed to avoid tearing the tape. Some systems used <b>fanfold</b> <b>paper</b> tape rather than rolled paper tape. In these systems, no rewinding was necessary nor were any fancy supply reel, takeup reel, or tension arm mechanisms required; the tape merely fed from the supply tank through the reader to the takeup tank, refolding itself back into exactly the same form as when it was fed into the reader.* Low information density. Datasets much larger than a few dozen kilobytes are impractical to handle in paper tape format.|$|E
50|$|Impact {{printers}} create noise {{when the}} pins or typeface strike the ribbon to the paper, and sound-damping enclosures {{may have to}} be used in quiet environments. They can only print lower-resolution graphics, with limited color performance, limited quality, and lower speeds compared to non-impact printers. While they support <b>fanfold</b> <b>paper</b> with tractor holes well, single-sheet paper {{may have to be}} wound in and aligned by hand, which is relatively time-consuming, or a sheet feeder may be utilized which can have a lower paper feed reliability. When printing labels on release paper, they are prone to paper jams when a print wire snags {{the leading edge of the}} label while printing at its very edge. For text-only labels (e.g. mailing labels), a daisy wheel printer or band printer may offer better print quality and a lower risk of damaging the paper.|$|E
50|$|The LA30 was {{followed}} in 1974 by the LA36, which achieved far greater commercial success, becoming {{for a time}} the standard dot matrix computer terminal. The LA36 used the same print head as the LA30 but could print on forms of any width up to 132 columns of mixed-case output on standard green bar <b>fanfold</b> <b>paper.</b> The carriage was moved by a much-more-capable servo drive using a DC electric motor and an optical encoder / tachometer. The paper was moved by a stepper motor. The LA36 was only available with a serial interface but unlike the earlier LA30, no fill characters were required. This was possible because, while the printer never communicated at faster than 30 characters per second, the mechanism was actually capable of printing at 60 characters per second. During the carriage return period, characters were buffered for subsequent printing at full speed during a catch-up period. The two-tone buzz produced by 60 character-per-second catch-up printing followed by 30 character-per-second ordinary printing was a distinctive feature of the LA36 quickly copied by many other manufacturers well into the 1990s. Most efficient dot matrix printers used this buffering technique.|$|E
