5|$|Though {{it might}} seem as if the Bible {{translation}} set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during {{the remainder of the}} century. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 17th century that spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. The spelling debate raged on until the early 19th century, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> latter half of the 19th century that the orthography reached generally acknowledged standards.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> late 18th and {{the early}} 19th century that the first European Americans {{explored}} the remote and hard-to-reach area.

5|$|Substitutes, {{such as the}} wheat-based rice substitute, ptitim, were introduced, and {{versatile}} vegetables such as eggplant were used as alternatives to meat.

5|$|The {{suppression}} of Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt signalled {{the end of}} the power of the tribal nobility of Iraq, which henceforth came under the direct control of the Umayyad regime's staunchly loyal Syrian troops.

5|$|As the 19th century wore on, workhouses {{increasingly}} became refuges for the elderly, infirm {{and sick}} {{rather than the}} able-bodied poor, and in 1929 legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals. Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930, many continued under their new appellation of Public Assistance Institutions {{under the control of}} local authorities. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> National Assistance Act of 1948 that the last vestiges of the Poor Law disappeared, and with them the workhouses.|$|E
