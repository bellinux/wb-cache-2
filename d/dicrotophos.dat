40|$|An organic-inorganic hybrid 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) - {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS) {{was produced}} using sol-gel method {{and used as}} coating on glass encased stir bar. The physico-chemical properties and extraction ability of the APTMS/PDMS hybrid coatings were manipulated by varying the molar ratio of APTMS to PDMS, amount of water and types of catalysts during sol synthesis. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy results showed successful hybridization between PDMS and amino moiety. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy showed a homogenous surface image of the APTMS/PDMS hybrid coating while nitrogen adsorption indicated that the hybrid is a mesoporous material (pore size ~ 2. 9 nm). The ability of the APTMS/PDMS hybrid coatings were investigated for stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) of two selected organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) namely polar <b>dicrotophos</b> and mid-polar malathion. Analysis was performed using HPLC with UV detector. Optimized SBSE parameters using APTMS/PDMS hybrid coating were 300 rpm stirring rate, 15 min extraction time, 1 mL methanol as ultrasonic assisted liquid desorption (UA-LD) solvent and 25 min desorption time. The optimized SBSE parameters using PDMS-coated TWISTER were also similar with the APTMS/PDMS hybrid coating except that the stirring rate used was 600 rpm. The limit of detection (LOD) (S/N= 3) of <b>dicrotophos</b> is 0. 108 mg L- 1 and 0. 158 mg L- 1 for malathion using APTMS/PDMS hybrid coating. LOD (S/N= 3) of malathion is 0. 31 mg L- 1 but <b>dicrotophos</b> was not detected with the PDMS-coated TWISTER. The APTMS/PDMS sol-gel coating developed for SBSE was successfully applied for the determination of OPPs in grape and cucumber samples, and its performance was compared with commercial PDMS TWISTER. The recoveries of <b>dicrotophos</b> and malathion from cucumber and grape samples using APTMS/PDMS hybrid coating was 71 % and 98 %, respectively with RSD 3. 1 %- 3. 6 %. The recoveries of malathion in cucumber and grape using PDMS-coated TWISTER was 91 % and 62 % respectively, with acceptable RSD 7. 46 %.

40|$|Sorbents {{based on}} silica {{are widely used}} in solid phase {{extraction}} (SPE). The most common SPE material is C 18. Recently nanoparticleshave gained interest as sorbent materials for analytical purpose. In this study silica-based nanoparticles with polar and non-polar groups were synthesized using cyanopropyltriethoxysilane (CNPrTEOS) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as precursor {{in the presence of}} ammonia solution as catalyst and ethanol as solvent via sol-gel technology. The sol-gel SiO 2 -NPs-CNPrTEOS was used for the simultaneous extraction of three organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) of different polarity namely <b>dicrotophos,</b> diazinon and chlorpyrifos prior to LC-UV detection at 270 nm. The sorbent produced was characterized using FTIR, FESEM, nitrogen gas adsorption and TGA. The surface area and average pore diameter of the sorbent are 570 m 2 g- 1 and 31 Å (mesoporous), respectively. The average particle size of SiO 2 -NPs-CNPrTEOS is 54 nm. The mesoporous SiO 2 -NPs-CNPrTEOS showed superior extraction capability for the polar <b>dicrotophos</b> and also for the non-polar diazinon and chlorpyrifos compared to commercial cyano SPE. The new SiO 2 -NPs-CNPrTEOS exhibits high potential as a bipolar sorbent for the simultaneous extraction of polar and non-polar OPPs.

40|$|The Air, Pesticides, and Toxics Division of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has {{encouraged}} all states {{to develop a}} plan to manage the use of pesticides to prevent application that would result in unreasonable risks to {{human health and the environment}} from contamination of ground water. In February, 1988, EPA proposed a strategy where by they would regulate certain pesticides by prohibiting their use in areas vulnerable to leaching unless a state develops and implements a management plan acceptable to EPA. However, banning the use of a pesticide in a region is the worst case scenario available to the TWC for managing water quality. The Texas Water Commission (TWC) assessed the State for areas vulnerable to leaching and found the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) to be a highly vulnerable area. This study examines three pesticides (atrazine, <b>dicrotophos,</b> and aldicarb) currently used in the LRGV that were identified by the TWC as potential contaminants of ground water. Alternative methods of controlling pests in this region were identified, and the economic impacts of withdrawing one or all three of these pesticides from the study area were estimated. Regional impacts on gross receipts (sales), variable costs, and net returns were determined. If atrazine use were banned in the LRGV, corn and sorghum sales would decrease by approximately $ 1 million, variable costs to produce corn, sorghum, and sugarcane would increase by almost $ 2 million dollars, leaving farmers in the region with a $ 3 million dollar 1088 in net income per year. If <b>dicrotophos</b> use were prohibited in the LRGV, variable cost to produce cotton would increase by over $ 600, 000 for the region as a whole. Banning aldicarb use in the study area would reduce citrus sales by almost $ 3 million, increase variable costs to produce citrus by over $ 200, 000, and reduce farmer net income by over $ 3 million annually...|$|E
40|$|Stink bugs are {{beginning}} to emerge as important pests of cotton that often require management in the Lower Texas Gulf Coast. As eradication of the boll weevil progresses and producers increasingly adopt transgenic cotton varieties resulting in reduced broad spectrum pesticide use, stink bugs will likely become key cotton pests in this area. The Lower Texas Gulf Coast has a stink bug complex that differs somewhat from {{other areas of the}} Cotton Belt. Euschistus servus and lesser brown stink bugs, including E. quadrator, E. obscurus, E. crassus, and E. ictericus, make up the largest portion of this pest complex, and green/southern green stink bugs play less important roles than in other areas. Using evidence of internal feeding as a sampling criterion detected stink bug infestations more frequently that when using visual or drop cloth sampling methods. The main drawback to using this method is that species composition may still need to be determined when an economic threshold is reached in order to select the most effective control. Euschistus servus and E. quadrator both caused significant reductions in yield and fiber quality in cotton bolls, but E. servus was able to reduce yield and quality in small (1. 8 cm), medium (2. 8 cm), and large (3. 2 cm) bolls, whereas E. quadrator reduced yield in only small bolls and reduced quality in only small and medium bolls. In general, E. servus caused more damage to bolls than E. quadrator and was able to damage a wider range of boll sizes. <b>Dicrotophos</b> was the most effective insecticide for stink bug control. Exposure to pyrethroids caused high mortality in N. viridula similar to that of <b>dicrotophos,</b> but pyrethroid activity was more variable when E. servus were exposed. In general, E. quadrator was more susceptible to insecticide treatments than E. servus, but both had similar mortalities when exposed to organophosphates, pyrethroids, and carbamates. Dynamic evidence of internal feeding thresholds may potentially be the best method for determining the need for stink bug control in cotton, but further research is necessary to refine these thresholds and make them applicable to the Lower Texas Gulf Coast...|$|E

40|$|Ten day old chick {{sympathetic}} ganglia cultured in a microslide assembly {{were treated}} with a selected group of organophosphate pesticides to evaluate their cytotoxicity ranges, and the usefulness of such a model for screening pesticides. Examination by phase contrast and light microscopy for chemically-induced morphological alteration of nerve fibers, glial cells and neurons provided the criteria for quantitation and assessment of the toxic effects. Concentrations that produced half-maximal effects ranged from 1 × 10 - 6 M (severely toxic) for methylparathian, diazinon, paraoxon, mevinphos, diisopropylfluorophosphate, tri-o-tolyl phosphate and its mixed isomers to a 1 × 10 - 3 M (intermediate) for malathion, leptophos, coumaphos, mono- and <b>dicrotophos.</b> Some or no effects were evident at 1 × 102 -M for O'ethyl-O-p-nitrophenyl phenyl phosphonothioate, tri-m-tolylphosphate, chlorpyriphos and triphenyl phosphate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{separate}} hydrophobic and hydrophilic OPPs using micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) with on-column UV detection and the challenge of decreasing the detection limit was met by online preconcentration methods. Successful separation of hydrophobic OPPs (methidathion, diazinon, quinalphos, chlorpyrifos and profenofos) was achieved by NM-MEKCSDS that comprised a separation buffer of 10 mM phosphate-borate (pH 9. 3), 10 mM SDS and 10 % v/v 1 : 1 mixture of methanol-acetonitrile, where sample was prepared in similar buffer matrix and was injected by electrokinetic mode. Using online sample pre-concentration technique called sweeping (sweeping-NM-MEKC-SDS), sensitivity enhancement factors either in terms of peak areas (SEFarea) or in terms of peak heights (SEFheight) were found to be more than 10 for each pesticide. In reverse migration MEKC (RM-MEKC-SDS) with highly acidic separation buffer, only three OPPs viz. methidathion, quinalphos and either diazinon, profenofos or chlorpyrifos were resolved, as possible optimization scheme were unable to resolve the co-elution of diazinon, profenofos and chlorpyrifos.

40|$|The western {{burrowing}} owl, Athene cunicularia hypugaea, is a Federal Species of Concern, whose {{numbers and}} range have been drastically reduced from historic levels in Texas. Burrowing owls roost and forage in agricultural areas, {{and it has}} been hypothesized that exposure to insecticides may be a factor in the decline of their population. Burrowing owls wintering in southern Texas use agricultural culverts in cotton fields as roost sites, which may increase their risk of exposure to agricultural chemicals, either through ingestion of contaminated prey or through dermal exposure to agricultural runoff. Simulation modeling was used to characterize the risks to individual burrowing owls wintering in agricultural landscapes in southern Texas due to effects of exposure to insecticides or other agricultural chemicals. The simulation model was created using Stella? VII software (High Performance Systems, Inc., New Hampshire, USA). The model is broken into four submodels simulating (1) foraging behavior of burrowing owls, (2) chemical applications to crops, (3) chemical transfer and fate in the crop soil and prey items, and (4) chemical exposure in the burrowing owl. This model was used to evaluate (1) which components of the model most affect the endpoints, (2) the relationship between increased concentrations of agricultural chemicals in culverts and subsequent lethal and sublethal effects from dermal exposure to agricultural runoff, and (3) which agricultural chemicals have the greatest potential to cause adverse effects in burrowing owls. Model results suggested (1) the half-lives of agricultural chemicals in birds caused the most variation in the results, and data gaps exist for several important model components (2), exposure to increased concentrations of agricultural chemicals in culverts is unlikely to result in lethal effects, but is likely to lead to sublethal effects in burrowing owls, and (3) the chemicals with the greatest potential to negatively affect burrowing owls wintering in southern Texas are the OP insecticides chlorpyrifos, <b>dicrotophos,</b> and disulfoton, the oxadiazine insecticide indoxacarb, the herbicide trifluralin, and the defoliants tribufos and paraquat. The results of this model demonstrate the usefulness of simulation modeling to guide future research related to the conservation of burrowing owls...|$|E
40|$|Pesticide {{contamination}} {{has been}} a widely publicised topic over the past 30 years {{and will continue to}} be a heated discussion point in the future. Given the level of scrutiny under which the water sector operates (namely for water quality, water availability and pricing), a robust technique is needed for the determination of pesticide residues in source waters that is both cost effective and reliable. This research project is aimed at developing such a technique to help water authorities meet this challenge. The method investigated utilised a flow injection system with tris(2, 2 ’-bipyridyl) ruthenium(III) chemiluminescence detection (FICA) applied to the determination of atrazine, simazine, hexazinone, monocrotophos, and <b>dicrotophos</b> in natural waters. The FICA method presented utilises a chemically oxidized chemiluminescent reagent, which was optimised using a combination of multivariate and univariate optimisation procedures. The optimised experimental conditions were: sample and carrier flow rates of 4. 6 mL min- 1, sample at pH 9 buffered with 50 mM borax, and a reagent concentration of 1 mM tris(2, 2 ’-bipyridyl) ruthenium(III) in 20 mM H 2 SO 4 (pH 1) with a limit of detection of 1. 3 ± 0. 1 µg L- 1 achieved for atrazine in MilliQ water. It was also shown that similar compounds, such as atrazine metabolites and other triazine pesticides, produced a chemiluminescent signal with tris(2, 2 -bipyridyl) ruthenium(III). When the method was applied to natural waters, the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) caused significant interference. This interference was investigated along with various cations and anions at levels commonly found in natural waters. It was observed that Fe 3 + and Fe 2 + (at concentrations above drinking water guidelines) caused interference. Fluorescence spectra were obtained for these samples to investigate the interaction between DOM, the selected pesticides and the interfering cations and anions. It was concluded that a complex formed between the analyte and DOM, and in the presence of interfering cations and anions the formation of the complex was enhanced. The interference from DOM was removed by solid phase extraction (SPE), and by incorporating an in-line SPE extraction column, the rapid detection of pesticide residues that had previously proven to be difficult due to interfering species was realised. A variety of extraction resins were evaluated for use in the in-line SPE housing, with Nexus© resin being the best of the ones tested. The detection limits achieved were 14, 48 and 32 ng L- 1 for atrazine, hexazinone, and simazine, respectively. Lastly, a low-pressure monolithic column was merged with the in-line SPE FICA system in order to create a hybrid FIA system analogous to a low pressure HPLC system. The incorporation of a monolithic column enabled atrazine, simazine and hexazinone to be detected simultaneously with chromatographic differentiation, with method detection limits of 27, 39 and 60 ng L- 1, respectively. The FICA system described in this thesis will be very useful as a quick, sensitive screening method for atrazine, simazine, hexazinone in natural waters. The methods developed during the course of this project should be considered by water utilities for inclusion in their ongoing pesticide monitoring programs...|$|E
