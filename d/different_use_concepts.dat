We {{present a}} method for {{identifying}} potentially interesting and useful concepts in a concept lattice and revising the underlying formal context and the lattice it generates to invent new descriptors and extract their definitions.

A consequence of <b>using</b> the <b>concept</b> lattice to represent the concept space is that both unsupervised and supervised approaches are enabled by <b>using</b> <b>different</b> <b>concept</b> evaluation measures.

40|$|We {{undertook}} a self study {{to examine and}} develop our pedagogical content knowledge for teaching the nature of science. We explored two <b>different</b> <b>uses</b> of <b>concept</b> mapping to assess preservice teachers‟ ideas {{about the nature of}} science (NOS) in an elementary science methods course. The class was divided into two groups. Group 1 was provided with aspects of NOS as starter concepts for their maps, while Group 2 was asked to develop their own concepts related to “science”. We found that being given the NOS aspects constrained Group 1 ‟s ability to expand the connection of the main concept with other related words. On the other hand, Group 2 had difficulty moving beyond brainstorming related concepts. Based on this, we suggest that these two methods for concept mapping can be best <b>used</b> for <b>different</b> assessment purposes and at different points in NOS instruction...|$|R

While detectors can be variable in <b>different</b> ways <b>using</b> this <b>concept,</b> the paper describes an algorithm when the variable parameter {{is the size}} of the detectors in real-valued space. The algorithm is tested using synthetic and realworld datasets, including time series data that are transformed into multipledimensional data during the preprocessing phase. Preliminary results demonstrate that the new approach enhances the negative selection algorithm in efficiency and reliability without significant increase in complexity. ...|$|R

The {{results show that the}} answers to even these most fundamental questions depend on the mobility <b>concept</b> <b>used.</b> The implication is that before social scientists “do a mobility study, ” we need to be very clear about the mobility concept or concepts we wish to study.
