He served in the 40th and 41st Sessions of the West Virginia Legislature and completed his term in 1934. During the 1932 legislative year, the West Virginia Senate was led by the Republican Party majority. The following legislative year in 1933, White served as the floor leader for the West Virginia Senate's Democratic Party members. The West Virginia Senate's majority had shifted to the Democrats in 1933, and in January 1933, White was selected by A. G. Mathews, President of the West Virginia Senate, as chairman of the senate's Judiciary Committee. In this position, White introduced twelve bills in 1933 to correct <b>errors</b> <b>and</b> <b>omissions</b> in existing statutes. Also in the 1933 legislative year, White served as a member on the Finance; Roads and Navigation; Counties, Municipal Corporations; Rules; Medicine and Sanitation; Education; Privileges and Elections; and Redistricting committees. In the same year White was also appointed as a member on two special senate committees.|$|E

40|$|Performing {{a digital}} {{forensic}} investigation requires a formalized process to be followed. It also requires that certain principles are applied, such as preserving of digital evidence and documenting actions. The {{need for a}} harmonized and standardized digital forensic investigation process has been recognized in the digital forensics community and much scientific work has been undertaken to produce digital forensic investigation process models, albeit with many disparities within the different models. The problem is that these existing models do not include any processes dealing explicitly with concurrent digital forensic principles. This leaves room for human <b>error</b> <b>and</b> <b>omissions,</b> {{as there is a}} lack of clear guidelines on the implementation of digital forensic principles. This paper proposes the introduction of concurrent processes into the digital forensic investigation process model. The authors define concurrent processes as the actions which should be conducted in parallel with other processes within the digital forensic investigation process, with the aim to fulfill digital forensic investigation principles. The concept of concurrent processes is a novel contribution that aims to enable more efficient and effective digital forensic investigations, while reducing the risk of human <b>error</b> <b>and</b> <b>omissions</b> which result in digital evidence being contaminated.

He repeats and elaborates upon Feltrinelli's claims that the CIA operatives had photographed a manuscript of the novel and secretly printed {{a small number of}} books in the Russian language. More recently, Anna Sergeyeva-Klyatis wrote that the first Russian edition of Doctor Zhivago, which was a pirated version with numerous typographical <b>errors</b> <b>and</b> <b>omissions,</b> was actually initiated by the Central Association of Postwar Émigrées, in response to a growing demand among Russian émigrés.|$|E
25|$|During the Elizabethan era {{and through}} the mid-seventeenth century, plays and poems were {{commonly}} printed as separate works in quarto format. Eighteen of Shakespeare's 36 plays included in first folio collected edition of 1623, were previously separately printed as quartos, with a single exception that was printed in octavo. For example, Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1, the most popular play of the era, was first published as a quarto in 1598, with a second quarto edition in 1599, followed {{by a number of}} subsequent quarto editions. Bibliographers have extensively studied these different editions, which they refer to by abbreviations such as Q1, Q2, etc. The texts of some of the Shakespeare quartos are highly inaccurate and are full of <b>errors</b> <b>and</b> <b>omissions.</b> Bibliographer Alfred W. Pollard named those editions Bad quartos, and it is speculated that they may have been produced, not from manuscript texts, but from actors who had memorized their lines.|$|E

One building probably being the old Laigh Chapelton Farm and the other, on the right, being the residence built for James McAlister. The photograph (Davis 1991) seems to be of {{the side of the house}} facing onto the road and the Chapel Hill. The 1851 OS shows formal gardens with a boundary wall, paths and a central feature, possibly a pond. The 1897 OS shows one large building with wings and extensions which appear to be porches and possibly a conservatory. By this date the formal gardens are absent, as in the 1911 OS. The ha-ha is not shown in the large scale map of 1897 OS, but appears to be present in the 1858 and the 1911 editions. No footbridge can be made out, however the OS maps have a number of <b>errors</b> <b>and</b> <b>omissions,</b> especially the exact outlines of buildings which are often only 'approximations'.

25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 2 April 2012, Pécsi Újság called into question whether Gyurcsány submitted a diploma thesis. István Geresdi, Dean of the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Pécs told Pécsi Újság that {{they were unable to}} find Gyurcsány's diploma thesis. He further added that Gyurcsány's thesis was the only missing work from that time period. On 3 April Gyurcsány published a page from his course record book that stated that he submitted and defended a college thesis. He also stated {{that he did not know}} where his own copy of his thesis was, but he would make efforts to locate and publish it. After two weeks, on 13 April he announced that he failed to find his copy of the thesis. On 27 April Hír TV, a government-leaning television channel announced that they have found evidence that Szabolcs Rozs, who was Gyurcsány's brother-in-law in 1984, submitted a college thesis at the same college and department as Gyurcsány, with a title identical to Gyurcsány's work, in 1980. Three days later, on 30 April Hír Tv announced that they have located and compared the reviews of both Rozs's and Gyurcsány's work, and found that based on the common <b>errors</b> <b>and</b> <b>omissions,</b> the two texts are likely to be identical, supporting the allegations of plagiarism.|$|E
25|$|The {{explanation}} above discloses another {{difference between}} title insurance and other types: title insurance premiums are not principally calculated {{on the basis}} of actuarial science, as is true in most other types of insurance. Instead of correlating the probability of losses with their projected costs, title insurance seeks to eliminate the source of the losses through the use of the recording system and other underwriting practices. As a result, a relatively small fraction of title insurance premiums are used to pay insured losses. The great majority of the premiums is used to finance the title research on each piece of property and to maintain the title plants used to efficiently do that research. There is significant social utility in this approach as the result conforms with the expectations of most property purchasers and mortgage lenders. Generally, they want the real estate they purchased or lent money on to have the title condition they expected when they entered the transaction, rather than money compensation and litigation over unexpected defects. This {{is not to say that}} title insurers take no actuarial risks. There are several matters that can affect the title to land that are not disclosed by the recording system but that are covered by the policies. Some examples are deeds executed by minors or mentally incompetent persons, forged instruments (in some cases), corporate instruments executed without the proper corporate authority and errors in the public records. However, historically, these problems have not amounted to a high percentage of the losses paid by the insurers. A more significant percentage of losses paid by the insurers are the result of <b>errors</b> <b>and</b> <b>omissions</b> in the title examining process itself.|$|E

Construction industry is a larger project which is complex since it involves variety of parties who {{are related to the}} project. Due to the multidisciplinary of the project participants, conflict becomes unavoidable issue in the construction industries. Internal conflicts that commonly involved the parties that directly participate in the project such as project developers, project consultants, and project contractors. Internal conflict can break the relationship among the participants, affect the work quality and productivity, and may lead to project fail if it is not manage in well. Thus, this research aim to identify the causes and effects that lead to internal conflict among three categories of the respondents, which are Developer, Contractor and Consultant. The survey questionnaire had been used in collecting the data from 134 of the respondents. The literature review in this study highlighted 4 main causes such as Contractual problems, Design/scope related problems, Management problems and Behavioural problems; and 4 main effects which are Time, Cost, Productivity and Quality, and Organization and its reputation related effects. Based on the analysis result from the collected data, the 4 most significant causes are <b>Error</b> <b>and</b> <b>Omission</b> in Project Design, Ambiguities in Contract Documents, <b>Error</b> <b>and</b> <b>Omissions</b> in the Contract Terms and Improper Planning and Scheduling, whereas most significant effects of internal conflict are Delay in Project Duration, Lost of Profitability, and Project Cost Overruns. Besides this, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient Analysis and Spearman Rank Correlation Analysis had been used to test the strength of relationship between causes and effects of internal conflict, and test the degree of agreement between 3 categories of respondents to the causes and effects.
