2500|$|During {{the early}} years of its existence, prior to the opening of the fourth canal, {{navigation}} was only possible to {{the east side of the}} bridge. Electrical power to operate the bridge was supplied via an overhead cable from the west shore. [...] With the opening of the fourth canal, there was navigable water on both sides making an overhead wire impossible. [...] Since the bridge was designed to have the power fed from overhead and not beneath, an underwater cable was run from the shore to the more northerly concrete fender (which protected the ends of the bridge from ships when it swung). [...] A pole was erected on each [...] fender, and a <b>guy</b> <b>wire</b> run between them directly over the bridge. [...] The power cable was suspended from this <b>guy</b> <b>wire</b> to reach the top-hat-shaped device in the middle of the bridge which transferred the power to the rotating bridge. [...] This top-hat, and the two poles on the fenders, are still visible today. [...] This is a relatively unusual method of providing power to a swing bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Operating {{a flight}} from Cologne, Germany to Croydon Airport, United Kingdom via Haren Airport, Brussels, Belgium, the {{aircraft}} departed at 12:20 local time (11:20 GMT), which was 20 minutes later than scheduled. As a result of fog, the aircraft was flying on a route {{to the north of}} its normal route. At 13:15, whilst flying at an altitude of , it crashed into a <b>guy</b> <b>wire</b> of the [...] tall radio mast at Ruysselede, which was illuminated at the time. The top section of the mast was demolished. The aircraft lost a wing and crashed. Four workers at the radio station rushed to the aid of those on board the aircraft, as did twelve villagers from Ruysselede. At least one passenger was seen to have survived the crash. There was an explosion and the wreckage of the aircraft was burnt out. The rescuers all suffered burns.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the day of}} the walk, June 15, 2012, crowds {{estimated}} {{in the tens of thousands}} gathered on the American side of the falls. On the Canadian side, the crowd was estimated at 120,000 people. Due to the location, the wire could not use supports and had to be custom made. As a result, the wire was able to sway significantly in the breeze, making the crossing more difficult than it would have otherwise been. It was the first time in Wallenda's career that he performed without <b>guy</b> <b>wire</b> stabilizers. [...] The wire was two inches (five centimeters) in diameter, significantly wider than the 5/8 of an inch wire Wallenda typically uses, and weighed roughly 8.5 tons (7,700kg). The extra width was necessary to make the cable strong enough to withstand the tension required. [...] Getting it across the Falls was a major technological challenge. [...] On June 12, a helicopter flew a yellow rope across the canyon. The rope was attached to the steel high-wire and a giant winch was used to slowly pull the wire across as the crew slowly increased tension to support the increasing weight. [...] Weighted pendulums were attached every [...] to keep the wire from twisting.|$|E

5000|$|On January 11, 2008, at 12:46 PM {{local time}} (1846 UTC), the tower {{collapse}}d. [...] The {{cause of the}} collapse remains unknown. [...] The crew replaced older <b>guy</b> <b>wires,</b> massive cables that keep the structure in place, and claimed that as they were loosening {{one of the older}} <b>guy</b> <b>wires,</b> the structure suddenly began to shake and then collapsed. No serious injuries took place. The structure broke into three pieces as it came crashing down, which was what it was designed to do.|$|R
50|$|In {{practical}} terms, erecting {{a horizontal}} loop antenna {{on a ship}} caused several problems. The loop was supported by <b>guy</b> <b>wires</b> from a central mast. It was too wide for the ship to pass through Dutch ship canals, so the side sections had to be hinged {{so they could be}} raised to a vertical position until the ship was at sea. The initial design was not strong enough and one of the side sections buckled in strong winds, so the entire loop had to be reinforced and the <b>guy</b> <b>wires</b> strengthened.|$|R
5000|$|June 24, 1968 - A North Central Airlines plane clipped a <b>guy</b> <b>wire</b> on the 2032 ft tower for KELO-TV (Sioux Falls, South Dakota). The {{tower in}} Rowena was in service {{less than a}} year and was {{completely}} destroyed. Luckily, the plane landed safely with no injuries.|$|E

While the tower remained standing and intact (other than the <b>guy</b> <b>wire),</b> the station was forced to temporarily cease its over-the-air signal although broadcasts on cable were not affected. If its tower collapsed, this could have also caused the tower of WALB to topple as both were only 150 feet (45 m) apart.As a result, Raycom (which at that time still operated WFXL while the sale to Barrington awaited FCC approval) acquired auxiliary transmitters and antennas for both WALB and WFXL which were installed at the tower at WALB's studios in Albany.|$|E

5000|$|On Tuesday, March 18, 2008 at 2:30 pm Pacific Standard Time the {{replacement}} tower collapsed while under construction. The tower was about 300 feet tall (the final height {{was to be}} 684 feet) when a <b>guy</b> <b>wire</b> support failed, causing the tower to tip over the opposite direction. There were no major injuries, and only limited collateral damage. The reason for the failure {{is assumed to be}} a combination of factors, including the much higher per unit weight of the new 84" [...] cross-section tower, compared to the 1948 tower which had a 42" [...] cross-section, and the inadequacy of the 1948 pier and <b>guy</b> <b>wire</b> terminations, one of which had previously been modified to a cantilever design to facilitate the passage of vehicles under that termination (and, it was the cantilever termination which catastrophically failed during this erection attempt). All of these structural components were replaced or strengthened in preparation for erection of the third tower, which is identical in design to the (failed) replacement tower.|$|E
5000|$|On July 10, 2008, a truck accidentally {{backed into}} one of the <b>guy</b> <b>wires</b> of the station's nearly-190-foot-tall tower, {{bringing}} the tower down and knocking the station off the air. While the AM broadcast signal was off, WIXE continued streaming online.|$|R
50|$|A {{guyed tower}} {{has a very}} small {{footprint}} and relies on <b>guy</b> <b>wires</b> in tension to support the structure and any unbalanced tension load from the conductors. A guyed tower {{can be made in}} a V shape, which saves weight and cost.|$|R
50|$|The Schwimmhalle {{is unique}} for its roof {{construction}} {{which is a}} lightweight stressed-skin structure. This curved structure bears loads through tension only, not compression. The double curvature in the roof design is what provides support which is further stabilized through pretensioned <b>guy</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cylindrical}} steel mast was regularly {{coated in}} ice {{during the winter}} months, and large icicles formed on the guy wires, placing them under great strain. During winter, ice falling from the guy-wires was common. For this reason, red warning lights on the tower operated when ice was a hazard, and notices were posted on the fence adjacent to Jagger Lane, below the <b>guy</b> <b>wire</b> crossings.|$|E

5000|$|In ground-anchored guys, the {{structure}} which attaches the guy-wire {{to the ground}} is called an anchor. The anchor must be adequate to resist the maximum tensile load of the guy wires; both the dead load of the tension of the wire and the maximum possible live load due to wind. Since the <b>guy</b> <b>wire</b> exerts its force at an angle, the anchor has both vertical and lateral (horizontal) forces on it.

50|$|Pilots {{had complained}} {{for years to}} KFI {{management}} that it needed to put strobe lights on the tower and highly reflective balls on the <b>guy</b> <b>wire.</b> KFI and Clear Channel Communications management responded by saying the tower was in compliance with Federal Communications Commission and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and {{that it did not}} need to make any changes. Until a replacement was successfully erected, the station transmitted from a 200-foot auxiliary tower at a power of 25,000 watts, but provisions had been made to transmit from the disused KRKD (KIIS) 1150 AM site just north of downtown Los Angeles, whenever the RF field towards the tower erection crew would exceed safety limits.|$|E
5000|$|Iwo Jima LORAN-C {{transmitter}} was a LORAN-C transmitter at Iwo Jima, Japan of Grid 9970 at [...] The Iwo Jima LORAN-C transmitter had {{a transmission}} power of 4 megawatts, {{which is more}} than the most powerful broadcasting stations. The Iwo Jima LORAN-C transmitter had a 411.5 metre (1350 ft) tall guyed mast, which was built in 1963. A <b>guy</b> <b>wire</b> insulator eyebolt failed sending the insulator crashing into the tower, knocking it out of plumb. It collapsed in 1964 on repair of the structural damage caused by the insulator. The collapsing tower killed four construction contract workers, three on the tower and one on the ground. The collapse also destroyed the transmitter building.|$|E
50|$|This mast {{was built}} as {{replacement}} of a 190.5 metre tall mast, which collapsed {{in a storm}} on 8 October 1980 {{as the result of}} too low tension on the <b>guy</b> <b>wires.</b> The guywires were adjusted by personnel from the USCG who mixed up pounds and kilograms.|$|R
50|$|The station {{came on the}} air in 1958 as KPOR, 1,000 watts, daytime only, {{licensed}} to Donald R. Nelson, and utilized an aluminum tower and a Collins 20V-1 transmitter. Nelson, and his wife Ann, operated the station for over ten years from a building which formerly contain a bank. With the door welded permanently open, the station used the abandoned bank vault for a news room. KPOR serviced Quincy and the surrounding farming community with a country music format. During program testing prior to officially going on the air, a crop dusting airplane crashed into the tower's <b>guy</b> <b>wires.</b> The tower crashed to the ground and, with some of the <b>guy</b> <b>wires</b> dangling from its wings, the plane made it safely back to its airport at Wenatchee, Washington.|$|R
