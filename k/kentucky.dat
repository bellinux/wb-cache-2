5|$|Although {{some historians}} have {{identified}} Garrard {{as a member}} of the Danville Political Club, a secret debating society that was active in Danville, <b>Kentucky,</b> from 1786 to 1790, his name is not found in the Club's official membership records. Garrard's biographer, H. E. Everman, concludes that these historians may have mistaken Garrard's membership in the <b>Kentucky</b> Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge for membership in the Danville Political Club. The groups had similar aims, were active at about the same time, and had several members in common. Other notable members of the <b>Kentucky</b> Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge included Isaac Shelby, Christopher Greenup, and Thomas Todd, all future <b>Kentucky</b> governors or gubernatorial candidates.|$|E

5|$|Among Beshear's other {{activities}} as lieutenant governor was {{his participation in}} an investigation of <b>Kentucky</b> Utilities' coal-buying practices.

Beshear had clashed with the company over similar issues during his term as attorney general. The company attempted to block Beshear's participation in the investigation, but the <b>Kentucky</b> Public Service Commission rejected the attempt. Due {{to the length of}} the investigation and the number of appeals filed, the matter was not fully adjudicated until 1992, well past the end of Beshear's term. The <b>Kentucky</b> Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of <b>Kentucky</b> Utilities.|$|E
