Strategies that meet a stock conservation criterion under a base case scenario are subjected to a set of robustness trials, including biased and highly variable abundance estimates and poaching.

Strategies that harvest heavily, even when the population is apparently very large, perform badly in the robustness trials. Setting a threshold below which harvesting does not take place, and above which all individuals are harvested, does not provide effective protection against over-harvesting. Strategies that rely on population growth rates rather than estimates of population size are more robust to biased estimates. The strategies that are most robust to uncertainty are simple, involving harvesting a relatively small proportion of the population each year. The simulation modelling approach to exploring harvesting strategies is suggested as a useful tool for the assessment of the performance of competing strategies under uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|The {{numerous}} {{man-made disasters}} and natural catastrophes that menace major communities accentuate {{the need for}} proper planning for emergency evacuation. Transportation networks in cities evolve over long time spans in tandem with population growth and evolution of travel patterns. In emergencies, travel demand and travel patterns drastically change from the usual everyday volumes and patterns. Given that most US and Canadian cities are already congested and operating near capacity during peak periods, network performance can severely deteriorate if drastic changes in Origin-Destination (O-D) demand patterns occur during or after a disaster. Also, loss of capacity due to the disaster and associated incidents can further complicate the matter. Therefore, the primary goal when a disaster or hazardous event occurs is to coordinate, control, and possibly optimize the utilization of the existing transportation network capacity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pediatric advance care {{planning}} {{differs from the}} adult setting in several aspects, including patients' diagnoses, minor age, and questionable capacity to consent. So far, research has largely neglected the professionals' perspective. AIM: We aimed to investigate the attitudes and needs of health care professionals with regard to pediatric advance {{care planning}}. DESIGN: This is a qualitative interview study with experts in pediatric end-of-life care. A qualitative content analysis was performed. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We conducted 17 semi-structured interviews with health care professionals caring for severely ill children/adolescents, from different professions, care settings, and institutions. RESULTS: Perceived problems with pediatric advance care planning relate to professionals' discomfort and uncertainty regarding end-of-life decisions and advance directives. Conflicts may arise between physicians and non-medical care providers because both avoid taking responsibility for treatment limitations according to a minor's advance directive. Nevertheless, pediatric advance care planning is perceived as helpful by providing an action plan for everyone and ensuring that patient/parent wishes are respected. Important requirements for pediatric advance care planning were identified as follows: repeated discussions and shared decision-making with the family, a qualified facilitator who ensures continuity throughout the whole process, multi-professional conferences, as well as professional education on advance care planning. CONCLUSION: Despite a perceived need for pediatric advance care planning, several barriers to its implementation were identified. The results remain to be verified in a larger cohort of health care professionals.

40|$|Antivaccination {{activists have}} existed since variolation was {{introduced}} in Europe in the 18 th century. Today, they continue to attempt to influence the vaccination decisions of parents. Commentators have {{expressed concern about the}} impact of such activists on vaccination rates and disease outbreaks. Some argue that public health advocates should engage in adversarial approaches involving public attempts to discredit or stop an antivaccination group or individual. This article argues that such adversarial advocacy {{may not be the most}} effective way to support vaccine programs. It argues this on the basis of what is known to influence vaccination attitudes and uptake, and the unintended negative consequences that can arise from an adversarial approach. These include drawing attention to such activists and their arguments, and potentially alienating the most important audience – hesitant parents – where the primary goal is to establish trust. The exception is when the antivaccination activists’ actions may cause direct harm, such as encouraging a ‘disease party’ or illegal activities. Generally, however, advocacy should focus on areas where real gains can be made – on policies that directly address determinants of low coverage such as lack of opportunity to vaccinate and lack of acceptance of vaccination. This includes advocacy for accessible and affordable vaccines. In addressing the global problem of vaccine hesitancy, public health has a responsibility to better monitor public attitudes, support health professionals in communication, <b>and</b> <b>develop</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> <b>strategies</b> that engage vaccine-hesitant parents and communities.

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that the wide {{variability}} in type, detail, and reliability of online information motivate expert searchers to develop procedural search knowledge. In contrast to prior research that has focused on finding relevant sources, procedural search knowledge focuses on how to order multiple relevant sources with the goal of retrieving comprehensive information. Because such procedural search knowledge is neither spontaneously inferred from the results of search engines, nor from the categories provided by domain-specific portals, the lack of such knowledge leads most novice searchers to retrieve incomplete information. In domains like healthcare, such incomplete information can lead to dangerous consequences. To address the above problem, a new kind of domain portal called a <b>Strategy</b> Hub was <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>tested.</b> <b>Strategy</b> Hubs provide critical search procedures and associated high-quality links to enable users to find comprehensive and accurate information.

A controlled experiment suggests that this approach can improve the ability of novice searchers in finding comprehensive and accurate information, when compared to general-purpose search engines and domain-specific portals.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} multi-agent constraint systems with preferences, modeled as soft constraint systems in which variables and constraints are distributed among multiple autonomous agents. We assume that each agent can set some preferences over its local data, and {{we consider}} two different criteria for finding optimal global solutions: fuzzy and Pareto optimality. We propose a general graph-based framework {{to describe the}} problem to be solved in its generic form. As a case study, we consider a distributed meeting scheduling problem where each agent has a pre-existing schedule and the agents must decide on a common meeting that satisfies a given optimality condition. For this scenario we consider the topics of solution quality, search efficiency, and privacy loss, where the latter pertains to information about an agent's pre-existing meetings and available time-slots. We also <b>develop</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> <b>strategies</b> that trade efficiency for solution quality and strategies that minimize information exchange, including some {{that do not require}} inter-agent comparisons of utilities.

Setting: Seven health centres in the Tiwi Islands and the Katherine West {{region of the}} Northern Territory. Participants: 137 Aboriginal people with type 2 diabetes. Intervention: Implementation of a multifaceted trial, including transfer of purchasing and planning responsibility to local health boards, the development and dissemination of clinical guidelines supported by electronic registers, recall and reminder systems and associated staff training, and audit and feedback. Main outcome measures: Trends {{in the proportion of}} Aboriginal people receiving services in accordance with clinical guidelines and in the proportion for whom specified levels of blood pressure and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) were achieved; health staff perceptions of barriers to effective service delivery. Results: An initial improvement in overall service levels from 40 % to 49 % was not fully sustained over the 3 -year period. The overall proportion of services delivered varied from 22 % to 64 % between communities and over time. The proportion of participants whose most recent HbA 1 c level was less than 7 % improved from 19 % to 32 %, but there was little change in blood pressure control. Perceived barriers to service delivery included discontinuities in staffing, lack of work-practice support and patients’ acceptance of services.

A soluble form of Flt- 1, a VEGF receptor, is {{potentially}} useful as an antagonist of VEGF, and accumulating evidence suggests the applicability of sFlt- 1 in tumor suppression. In the present study, we have <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>tested</b> <b>strategies</b> targeted specifically to VEGF for the treatment of ascites formation. Methods As an initial strategy, we produced recombinant sFLT- 1 in the baculovirus expression system and used it as a trap to sequester VEGF in the murine ascites carcinoma model. The effect of the treatment on the weight of the animal, cell number, ascites volume and proliferating endothelial cells was studied. The second strategy involved, producing Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells stably transfected with vectors carrying cDNA encoding truncated form of Flt- 1 and using these cells to inhibit ascites tumors in a nude mouse model. Results The sFLT- 1 produced by the baculovirus system showed potent antiangiogenic activity as assessed by rat cornea and tube formation assay. sFLT- 1 treatment resulted in reduced peritoneal angiogenesis with a concomitant decrease in tumor cell number, volume of ascites, amount of free VEGF and the number of invasive tumor cells as assayed by CD 31 staining. EAT cells stably transfected with truncated form of Flt- 1 also effectively reduced the tumor burden in nude mice transplanted with these cells, and demonstrated a reduction in ascites formation and peritoneal angiogenesis. Conclusions The inhibition of peritoneal angiogenesis and tumor growth by sequestering VEGF with either sFlt- 1 gene expression by recombinant EAT cells or by direct sFLT- 1 protein therapy is shown to comprise a potential therapy.

Despite the importance of accurate estimates of the attrition rate (and in particular the voluntary attrition rate) to conduct effective workforce planning, there is a dearth of an agreed definition, information and studies on this topic. We conducted a rapid review of studies published since 2005 on attrition rates of health workers from the workforce in different regions and settings; 1782 studies were identified, of which 51 {{were included in the}} study. In addition, we analysed data from the State of the World's Midwifery (SoWMy) 2014 survey and associated regional survey for the Arab states on the annual voluntary attrition rate for sexual, reproductive, maternal and newborn health workers (mainly midwives, doctors and nurses) in the 79 participating countries. There is a diversity of definitions of attrition and barely any studies distinguish between total and voluntary attrition (i. e. choosing to leave the workforce). Attrition rate estimates were provided for different periods of time, ranging from 3 months to 12 years, using different calculations and data collection systems. Overall, the total annual attrition rate varied between 3 and 44 % while the voluntary annual attrition rate varied between 0. 3 to 28 %. In the SoWMy analysis, 49 countries provided some data on voluntary attrition rates of their SRMNH cadres. The average annual voluntary attrition rate was 6. 8 % across all cadres.

This systematic literature review explored the relationship between the hospitalization rates and the COPD comorbidities, anxiety, and depression. Methods: The Centre for Research Dissemination&# 39;s framework for systematic reviews was followed using search terms relating to COPD, anxiety, depression, and hospital admission. Papers identified were assessed for relevance and quality, using a suitable Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool and Mixed Methods Assessment Tool. Results: Twenty quantitative studies indicated that anxiety and depression led to a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of COPD patients being hospitalized. These comorbidities also led to an increased length of stay and a greater risk of mortality postdischarge. Other significant factors included lower Body-Mass Index, Airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise scores, female gender, lower socioeconomic status, poorer patient perceived quality of life, increased severity of lung function, and less improvement in dyspnea from admission to discharge. It was also highlighted that only 27 %– 33 % of those with depression were being treated for it. Four qualitative studies revealed that patients saw anxiety and depression as a major factor that affected their ability to cope with and self-manage their condition. Implications: Findings from the systematic review have highlighted a need for better recognition and treatment of anxiety and depression amongst individuals with COPD.
