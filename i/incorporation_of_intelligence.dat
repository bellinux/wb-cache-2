Traditionally such intelligence takes either of two forms. The first is a methodical framework that guides actions supported by the design system (usually in a top-down fashion). The second is local, intelligence mechanisms that resolve discrete, relatively well-defined subproblems (often with limited if any user intervention). Local intelligent mechanisms offer the means for adaptability and transformability in architectural design systems, including the localization of global tendencies.

40|$|Cyber-physical systems (CPS) {{are the new}} {{generation}} of engineered systems integrated with computation and physical processes. The integration of computation, communication and control adds new capabilities to the systems being able to interact with physical world. The uncertainty in physical environment makes future CPS to be more reliant on machine learning algorithms which can learn and accumulate knowledge from historical data to support intelligent decision making. Such CPS with the <b>incorporation</b> <b>of</b> <b>intelligence</b> or smartness are termed as intelligent CPS which are safer, more reliable and more efficient. ^ This thesis studies fundamental machine learning algorithms in supervised and unsupervised manners and examines new computing architecture for the development of next generation CPS. Two important applications of CPS, including smart pipeline and smart grid, are also studied in this thesis. Particularly, regarding supervised machine learning algorithms, several generative learning and discriminative learning methods are proposed to improve learning performance. For the generative learning, we build novel classification methods based on exponentially embedded families (EEF), a new probability density function (PDF) estimation method, when some of the sufficient statistics are known. For the discriminative learning, we develop an extended nearest neighbor (ENN) method to predict patterns according to the maximum gain of intra-class coherence. The new method makes a prediction in a âtwo-way communication 2 Ì 2 style: it considers not only who are the nearest neighbors of the test sample, but also who consider the test sample as their nearest neighbors. By exploiting the generalized class-wise statistics from all training data, the proposed ENN is able to learn from the global distribution, therefore improving pattern recognition performance and providing a powerful technique {{for a wide range of}} data analysis applications. Based on the concept of ENN, an anomaly detection method is also developed in an unsupervised manner. ^ CPS usually have high-dimensional data, such as text, video, and other multi-modal sensor data. It is necessary to reduce feature dimensions to facilitate the learning. We propose an optimal feature selection framework which aims to select feature subsets with maximum discrimination capacity. To further address the information loss issue in feature reduction, we develop a novel learning method, termed generalized PDF projection theorem (GPPT), to reconstruct the distribution in high-dimensional raw data space from the low-dimensional feature subspace. ^ To support the distributed computations throughout the CPS, it needs a novel computing architecture to offer high-performance computing over multiple spatial and temporal scales and to support Internet of Things for machine-to-machine communications. We develop a hierarchical distributed Fog computing architecture for the next generation CPS. A prototype of such architecture for smart pipeline monitoring is implemented to verify its feasibility in real world applications. ^ Regarding the applications, we examine false data injection detection in smart grid. False data injection is a type of malicious attack which can threaten the security of energy systems. We examine the observability of false data injection and develop statistical models to estimate underlying system states and detect false data injection attacks under different scenarios to enhance the security of power systems. ...|$|E

In order to reduce the problems related to strong coupling in these processes, the search for the <b>incorporation</b> <b>of</b> artificial <b>intelligence</b> devices has shown an increasing trend in recent years. Due to this complexity and control in multivariable processes, diagnosis and fault monitoring in the processes have become increasingly difficult. Therefore, the application of these devices has achieved satisfactory results regarding the procedures performed with human operators. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a signal separation technique that is based on the use of higher order statistics to estimate each of the unknown sources, through observation of various mixtures generated from these sources. Although there are recent works on using the ICA in industrial processes, few studies have been made in cases involving distillation columns. This paper proposes a control strategy based on the ICA technique, which makes the control loops decoupled and hence the performance easier.

An innovative feature of this cellular model is the <b>incorporation</b> <b>of</b> swarm <b>intelligence</b> to stochastically optimize the transition rules to reduce the simulation uncertainties and improve its locational accuracy in urban modeling. The similarity between the nature of self-organization of particle swarm optimizers and the bottom-up approach of cellular automata makes PSO particularly suitable {{to search for the}} global optimum parameters of CA transition rules. The CA parameters retrieved by the PSO technique are able to express precisely the contributions of various driving forces to urban growth; hence an effective cellular model can be realized for modeling urban dynamics. The PSO based CA model was applied in Fengxian District of Shanghai Municipality, eastern China, to simulate the spatio-temporal process of urban growth from 1992 to 2008 at 30 m spatial resolution.

Studies suggest that physical and psychological health, as well as job satisfaction and organizational commitment, decrease {{as a result of}} elevated levels of occupational stress. Recently researchers have proposed that an intertwined relationship exists between emotional intelligence and occupational stress and that emotional intelligence plays a role in adaptive coping (Austin, Saklofske, & Egan, 2005; Gardner, 2005; Sahar-Khiz, 2010). Â Â This study systematically examined this contention by seeking to determine whether there is a relationship between emotional intelligence and stress management of North Carolina community college presidents. This was accomplished through a quantitative study of these constructs. The constructs were operationalized by means of a combination of scales present in the Occupational Stress Inventory-Revised and the Genos Emotional Intelligence Inventory. Â Â The study sample included 47 North Carolina community college presidents, for an overall response rate of 81 %. The study hypothesis was tested with multiple regression analysis by regressing seven subscales <b>of</b> emotional <b>intelligence</b> on three subscales of occupational stress-coping resources.

30|$|Research on {{big data}} {{analytics}} and context-aware computing {{has been active}} for more than 2 Â decades, resulting {{in the development of}} many concepts, approaches, and systems spanning a large number and variety of application domains. Context-aware computing has been researched extensively by the HCI community from various perspectives, including conceptual (e.g. [19, 20, 30, 31]), theoretical (e.g. [25, 32, 33]), critical (e.g. [12, 34, 35]), and philosophical (e.g. [36]). The notion <b>of</b> <b>intelligence</b> alluded to in pervasive computing, in which context awareness has been given a prominent role, has generated a growing level of criticism over the past decade, questioning its feasibility in terms of the inherent complexity surrounding the modeling of all kinds of situations of life (based on the cognitive, affective, emotional, social, behavioral, conversational, and physical subsets of context), as well as challenging its added value as to transforming the way people live (e.g. [19, 35 â 39]). The whole premise is that it is too difficult to identify and model the specifics of context in real life given their extreme subtlety, subjectivity, and fluidity. In addition, the failure of the original promise <b>of</b> <b>intelligence</b> points to a two-sided problem: the persistent elusiveness of ordinary human reasoning and knowing what people really want and the permissiveness of the definitional looseness <b>of</b> <b>intelligence</b> in terms <b>of</b> what can be expected of the role and scope of artificial reasoning in context-aware interaction paradigms ([38], p. 12). Context awareness research and development continues to grapple with the problem <b>of</b> what the <b>intelligence</b> in context-aware computing can stand for. Nonetheless, the notion <b>of</b> <b>intelligence</b> as enabled by context awareness capabilities has inspired a whole generation of scholars and researchers into a quest for the immense, fascinating opportunities enabled by the <b>incorporation</b> <b>of</b> computer/machine <b>intelligence</b> into our everyday lives, as well as a large body of research into new techniques and methods for enhancing the sensing, analysis, reasoning, inference, and modeling processes. These have been of extreme value to several other applications (industrial, urban, and organizational) than those directed for human users, in which these processes are inapt to handle the complexity of the nature and scope of inferences (context knowledge) generated by computationally constrained reasoning mechanisms and oversimplified models and on the basis of limited, uncertain, incomplete, or imperfect data collected through sensors. However, the issues stemming from these challenges are under scrutiny and investigation by the research community towards alternative directions (e.g. [39]), most notably situated intelligence which entails that the cognitive processes and behavior of a situated system should be the outcome of a close coupling between the system (agent) and the environment (user) (see [40]). This form <b>of</b> <b>intelligence</b> entails âassisting people in better assessing their choices and decisions and thus enhancing their actions and activitiesâ, and the âquest for situated forms <b>of</b> <b>intelligence</b> is seen by several eminent scholars as an invigorating alternative for artificial intelligence research within context-aware computingâ ([19], p. 9).|$|R

Commercial off-the-shelf digital electronics including data acquisition cards (DAQs), complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and microcontrollers have been used to achieve the desired outcome. The most completely integrated architecture achieved during the project used the CPLD along with a microcontroller. The CPLD provides the initial digital demodulation of the raw sensor signal, and then communicates over a parallel communications interface with a microcontroller. The microcontroller analyzes the digital signal from the CPLD, and applies a non-linear correction obtained through extensive data analysis at the various relevant EVA operating pressures. The microcontroller then presents the quantitatively accurate carbon dioxide partial pressure regardless of optical density. This technique could extend the linear dynamic range of typical absorption spectrometers, particularly those whose low end noise equivalent absorbance is below one-part-in- 100, 000. In the EVA application, it allows introduction of a path-length-enhancing architecture whose optical interference effects are well understood and quantified without sacrificing the dynamic range that allows quantitative detection at the higher carbon dioxide partial pressures. The digital components are compact and allow reasonably complete integration with separately developed analog control electronics without sacrificing size, mass, or power draw...|$|R
40|$|In {{operations}} management different ordering policies, such as, economic order quantity, lot for lot and periodic ordering, {{are used in}} various combinations without deeper considerations for the likely consequences on cash flow and profitability. The success of these techniques is analyzed through inventory levels and/or total cost. In this paper, we present results of simulation which uses three different product groups with varying demand characteristics, changing product margins and also considers product quality failures (due to ordering, engineering change or customer requests). Based on our results, we suggest a portfolio approach where lot for lot policy {{may be useful in}} an early phase of the product life-cycle and later it may be an advantage to change over to economic order quantity (EOQ) based ordering. However, demand sustainability and failure rates create instances where orders in larger economical lots may reduce profitability. Therefore, manufacturing may benefit from a portfolio of different purchase order policies and may evaluate the successful balance of policies using cash flow as a parameter. Accuracy of demand forecasting is vital to switching point estimation. Further research on real-world applications of advanced forecasting tools is advocated as well as a framework to develop the portfolio for intelligent purchasing systems. Current tools of {{operations management}} do not offer insight for advanced decision making. One potential method for tracking these signals may be the development of the GARCH technique (proven useful in financial risk management and awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Economics). Improving precision in predictive analytics may help in better execution of the switching point decision making (among other things) for much larger and more complex operations with vast number of decision parameters. The <b>incorporation</b> <b>of</b> ambient <b>intelligence</b> or algorithms from artificial intelligence may help purchasing systems learn how to be autonomous and/or help human operators to decide between portfolio of approaches by evaluating decisionable information extracted from data analytics (acquired from a plethora of business processes). Taken together, these represent potentially interesting future steps. Lappeenranta University of Technology (Finland), Accenture (Finland) and MIT Forum for Supply Chain Innovation [URL]...|$|R
