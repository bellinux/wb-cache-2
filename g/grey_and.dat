On 13 June he lost two of his leading supporters when Dare and Fletcher disputed who should ride one of the best horses provided by local supporters. Fletcher shot and killed Dare and was then put under arrest and sent back to the frigate Helderenberg. The next day, 40 cavalry and 400foot soldiers, under the command of Lord <b>Grey</b> <b>and</b> Wade, moved on to the nearby town of Bridport, where they encountered 1,200 men from the local royalist Dorset militia.

40|$|In the {{literature}} {{there is a}} presumption that a <b>grey</b> set <b>and</b> an interval-valued fuzzy set are equivalent. This presumption ignores the existence of discrete components in a grey number. In this paper new measurements of uncertainties of <b>grey</b> numbers <b>and</b> <b>grey</b> sets, consisting of both absolute and relative uncertainties, are defined to give a comprehensive representation of uncertainties in a <b>grey</b> number <b>and</b> a <b>grey</b> set. Some simple examples are provided to illustrate that the proposed uncertainty measurement can give an effective representation of both absolute and relative uncertainties in a <b>grey</b> number <b>and</b> a <b>grey</b> set. The relationships between <b>grey</b> sets <b>and</b> interval-valued fuzzy sets are also analysed {{from the point of}} view of the proposed uncertainty representation. The analysis demonstrates that <b>grey</b> sets <b>and</b> intervalvalued fuzzy sets provide different but overlapping models for uncertainty representation in sets...|$|R
5|$|After {{breaking}} up with Owen, Cristina continues to excel at surgery and becomes de facto chief of cardio. Although supportive of Meredith's choice to become a mother, Cristina points {{out the fact that}} it has hurt Meredith's career and clinical judgement. This causes a wedge in their friendship. Grey attempts to catch up professionally with a research trial, but the divide widens when Cristina's trial overshadows Grey's and steals Grey's resources. When Dr. Shane Ross, a second-year resident, stands up to Meredith for her, Cristina gives Shane a kiss. Later, she begins sleeping with him, as well as becoming his mentor and passing on the skills learned from Altman. Cristina's project is immensely successful and she is informed that she could be considered for the Harper Avery award from her 3-D printing of a heart conduit. <b>Grey</b> <b>and</b> Yang reconcile when Grey acknowledges that Yang is correct, she has surpassed <b>Grey,</b> <b>and</b> that Grey is jealous of Yang's professional freedom and success, while her own is hampered by her family.|$|E
5|$|Banksia lemanniana, {{commonly}} known as the yellow lantern banksia or Lemann's banksia, is a species of woody shrub of the family Proteaceae native to Western Australia. It generally grows as an open shrub or small tree to five metres (15ft) high with stiff serrated leaves, and unusual hanging inflorescences. Flowering occurs over summer, the greenish buds developing into oval flower spikes before turning <b>grey</b> <b>and</b> developing the characteristic large woody follicles. It occurs within and just east of the Fitzgerald River National Park on the southern coast of the state. Banksia lemanniana is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed.|$|E
