[...] "When there are no safe bets, that's when <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> blood move." [...] He also shared how {{important}} the lyrics to this song are for him when he posted a photograph of Unorthodox Jukeboxs artwork via his Twitter account. [...] "Soon you guys will hear a song I wrote called When I Was Your Man. I've never been this nervous. Can't explain it," [...] he tweeted. Philip Lawrence explained the inspiration of the song: [...] "I think Bruno and I are both huge fans of older music, like Billy Joel and Elton John. We always loved those moments where you can sit at the piano and emote. Those intimate moments when an artist is so naked and vulnerable; you can’t help but be drawn to it. We always wanted to find a stripped down song like that, which is how that song came to be. The subject matter was real life; Bruno had experienced that, so we tried to say it in the best and catchiest way we could." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{also paid}} tribute to the poet Luigi Alamanni, who took refuge in France after a {{conspiracy}} against Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, later Pope Clement VII. She writes about her [...] "pitiful end" [...] (miserando fine) and [...] "now that <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> bitter end near" [...] (or ch’io sento da presso il fine amaro), which leads one to think {{she was aware of}} her imminent murder, or perhaps waiting for the natural course of her sad existence. In the last compositions she finds consolation in Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary, through whom she seems to have finally accepted her painful existence and tried to find peace of mind, apparently reconciling herself to the land she once despised. Her final hope is to see herself [...] "totally freed from the stormy terrestrial cloud, and among the blessed souls" [...] (sgombrata tutta dal terrestre nembo, e fra l’alme beate).|$|E
2500|$|Zaid welcomed Abdullah's {{announcement}} {{in spite of}} the lack of a formal apology, saying: [...] "(One) can say sorry in other ways." [...] George Seah's son told the press that although all his father wanted was an apology, the family would not reject any goodwill payments. Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawanteh's wife said: [...] "Although I thank the prime minister, I feel less than satisfied at his decision (not to make a straightforward apology). This {{is not the end of}} the story for me. (Without an apology) I don't know, people don't know, that my husband was not guilty. I want my husband's name to be cleared. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> husband was innocent. He was an honest judge...Even so, I am thankful that our prime minister cares about us enough (to do this much)." [...] Tan Sri Eusoffe Abdoolcader's granddaughter regretted that acknowledgement had been so late in coming: [...] "I wish he was here. He's the main person affected by all this. It's a different case from the others (Salleh and Wan Suleiman) because he was reinstated. It's been 12 years. It should have been solved earlier." [...] Tun Salleh Abas however welcomed Abdullah's statement, saying: [...] "I feel great. It was something I didn't expect. I suffered so much humiliation ... so much so I ran away from the public and took solace in being a farmer." ...|$|E
