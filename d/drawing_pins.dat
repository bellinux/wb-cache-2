There was a strong representation of new hands, the paying students, youths and young men in black coats and silk hats or tweed suits, the scholar contingent, youngsters of Lewisham's class, raw, shabby, discordant, grotesquely ill-dressed and awe-stricken; one Lewisham noticed with a sailor's peaked cap gold-decorated, and one with mittens and very genteel grey kid gloves; and Grummett the perennial Official of the Books was busy among them.|$|E

50|$|The {{characterization}} of an ellipse as {{the locus of}} points so that sum of the distances to the foci is constant leads to a method of drawing one using two <b>drawing</b> <b>pins,</b> a length of string, and a pencil. In this method, pins are pushed into the paper at two points, which become the ellipse's foci. A string tied at each end to the two pins and {{the tip of a}} pencil pulls the loop taut to form a triangle. The tip of the pencil then traces an ellipse if it is moved while keeping the string taut. Using two pegs and a rope, gardeners use this procedure to outline an elliptical flower bed—thus it is called the gardener's ellipse.|$|E

5000|$|The {{drawing board}} is an {{essential}} tool. Paper will be attached and kept straight and still, so that the drawing {{can be done with}} accuracy. Generally, different kind of assistance rulers are used in drawing. The drawing board is usually mounted to a floor pedestal in which the board turns to a different position, and also its height can be adjustable. Smaller drawing boards are produced for table-top use. In the 18th and 19th centuries, drawing paper was dampened and then its edges glued to the drawing board. After drying the paper would be flat and smooth. The completed drawing was then cut free. Paper could also be secured to the drawing board with <b>drawing</b> <b>pins</b> [...] or even C-clamps. More recent practice is to use self-adhesive tape to secure paper to the board, including the sophisticated use of individualized adhesive dots from a dispensing roll. Some drawing boards are magnetized, allowing paper to be held down by long steel strips. Boards used for overlay drafting or animation may include registration pins or peg bars to ensure alignment of multiple layers of drawing media.|$|E

Methods:The pdf file that is attached shows the line printer output of the data we recorded from Rod Smallwoood's arm on the 27 th November 1981 and the dot matrix image which shows the ulna and radius bones. We made a 'radiotherapy type' mould of the arm and then put <b>drawing</b> <b>pins</b> through the plastic (pin head inwards) as electrodes. There two sets of data. One is recorded from the arm and the other is with saline filling the mould. The pdf file also shows my plot of the XY position of the electrodes. Now the data set on the line printer is a complete data set i. e. Drive 1 / 2 then 1 / 3 then 1 / 4 etc for every combination. I could only find the print out for one of the data sets. However, I found my notebook with the adjacent drive/receive data set and this is page 7 of the pdf file. I have extracted the adjacent drive/receive data sets for both the Uniform(Saline) and Arm data and these are included in the attached Excel file. The are 6 columns of data in the xls file. The first three are for the uniform case and give the two reciprocal data sets and the mean of the two. Columns 4 - 6 are for the arm. I did a quick reconstruction using columns 3 and 6 as ref and data respectively and it looked OK. The first column of data is 104 point as follows. Drive 1 / 2 receive 3 / 4 Drive 1 / 2 receive 4 / 5 etc Drive 1 / 2 receive 16 / 1 Drive 2 / 3 receive 4 / 5 Drive 2 / 3 receive 5 / 6 etc Drive 2 / 3 receive 16 / 1 Drive 4 / 5 receive 6 / 7 Drive 4 / 5 receive 7 / 8 etc Drive 4 / 5 receive 16 / 1 etc etc Drive 14 / 15 receive 16 / 1 The second column is the other reciprocal set.

50|$|A {{thumb tack}} (North American English) or push pin {{is a short}} nail or pin used to fasten items to a wall or board for display and {{intended}} to be inserted by hand, generally without the assistance of tools. A variety of names are {{used to refer to}} different designs intended for various purposes. Thumb tack and push pin are both sometimes compounded (thumbtack or pushpin) or hyphenated (thumb-tack or push-pin). Thumb tacks made of brass, tin or iron may be referred to as brass tacks, brass pins, tin tacks or iron tacks, respectively. These terms are particularly used in the idiomatic expression to come (or get) down to brass (or otherwise) tacks, meaning to consider basic facts of a situation. <b>Drawing</b> <b>pin</b> or drawing-pin refers to thumb tacks used to hold drawings on <b>drawing</b> boards.

40|$|In a fiber {{spinning}} process molten polymer is extruded into a fiber. The resulting fiber known as as-spun fiber is relatively weak and shows a large plastic central zone in its constitutive behavior. As {{a result the}} fiber deforms substantially without {{a significant change in}} load thus making it unsuitable for stress bearing applications. The range of plastic deformation is related to the natural draw ratio. In order to improve the mechanical properties of as spun fibers, {{fiber spinning}} is followed by a fiber draw process. With multi stage draw the as-spun fiber is drawn beyond the plastic region in various drawing zones which produces greater orientation of the polymer chains in the axial direction of the fiber thus enhancing mechanical strength characteristics of the fiber. The multistage draw process consists of several rollers each rotating at a speed greater than the one prior to it. The objective of this work is to develop a first approximation to model fiber draw in the multistage drawing process, with and without a <b>draw</b> <b>pin.</b> As the first step the slippage of fibers on rollers was analysed by including centrifugal acceleration and acceleration due to stretching. The draw in a free span is also modelled. Several representative draw processes were examined. It was found <b>draw</b> <b>pin</b> localizes the <b>draw</b> significantly although the resulting mechanical unloading complicates the analysis. Draw in the free span is impossible for isothermal draw processes, and anisothermal draw induces thermal unloading in the system. A comprehensive analysis of various draw processes will be examined.
