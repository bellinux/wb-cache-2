As in her previous work, {{most of the}} songs were in major keys with the most common being A-flat major and E-flat major. Second, third, fourth and fifth intervals were typical <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> scores with the piano accompaniment creating interest through varied rhythm patterns. In this volume, most of the compositions were Smith's own work, {{though some of the}} pieces were adaptations of German folk songs.|$|E

25|$|With Charlotte in Werther in 1974, Crespin began {{performing}} opera roles {{from the}} mezzo-soprano repertoire {{to adjust to}} the change <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> However the timbre of her voice had not altered much from her earlier singing years and she therefore brought a different sound to the roles from that of the typical mezzo-soprano. Regardless, she was well received in her new choice of repertoire. This period also led to her interest in Offenbach and her sophisticated wit found its place in recordings of Métella, the Grand Duchess of Gérolstein and Périchole, along with Dulcinée (Massenet's Don Quichotte).|$|E

500|$|With its chunky backbeat, gentle {{strings and}} funky guitar motif, 'Secret' is both languid and tense {{at the same}} time. The song has the air of quiet revelation and a {{relaxation}} of spirit. Madonna insisted later that the song wasn't just about love but also about spiritual self-empowerment.

500|$|Miss Calypso was {{a modest}} success. [...] Billboard Magazine's review {{said about the}} album, [...] " [...] calypso addicts will {{question}} the authenticity of this package, Miss Angelou has enough sell <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> to offer dealers a promising set. Selections include such oldies as [...] "Run Joe", [...] "Stone Cold Dead in the Market", and [...] "Calypso Blues", {{all of which are}} handled with finesse. Singer's name value is a rising commodity via her nitery dates, and should increase some {{as a result of this}} wax".|$|E

500|$|Alien {{originally}} was to conclude with {{the destruction of}} the Nostromo while Ripley escapes in the shuttle Narcissus. However, Ridley Scott conceived of a [...] "fourth act" [...] to the film in which the Alien appears on the shuttle and Ripley is forced to confront it. He pitched the idea to 20th Century Fox and negotiated an increase in the budget to film the scene over several extra days. Scott had wanted the Alien to bite off Ripley's head and then make the final log entry <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> but the producers vetoed this idea as they believed the Alien should die {{at the end of the}} film.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{lines of}} [...] "XO" [...] are echo-laden and in {{contrast}} to other songs on Beyoncé, the ballad contains several hooks. Beyoncé starts the song by asking a loved one to kiss her. Some of the ascending chorus lines are call and response; Beyoncé is backed by a sing-along crowd as she sings about how her [...] "darkest nights" [...] are enlightened by the lover's face: [...] "In the darkest night hour / I search through the crowd / Your face is all that I see / I give you everything". The chorus ends with the singer adding, [...] "Baby love me, lights out", with a croak <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Famitsu, Kawada related her experience writing the lyrics for [...] "Joint". Kawada {{said that she was}} challenged in writing lyrics for the song, since her previous single [...] "Get My Way" [...] was different from her previous singles. Kawada would read the source material of every anime before writing lyrics for its theme songs. She named the song [...] "Joint" [...] because of Shana II theme of characters Shana and Yūji Sakai fighting together. [...] In response to comments that the expressions <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> were very varied, Kawada stated that she simply sings with the music in the way that she most enjoys.|$|E

500|$|Pearl's {{voice is}} {{provided}} by American actress Lori Alan in the series and both feature films. During her audition for the role, she was shown an early drawing of Pearl with the other main characters. She noted how Pearl was {{much larger than the}} rest of the cast, and decided to reflect the character's size <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> by making it deep and full in tone. She also aimed to make the voice invoke the sound of whales’ low vocalizations while also sounding [...] "spoiled and lovable". In an interview with AfterBuzz TV, Alan said that she knew Pearl [...] "had to sound somewhat like a child," [...] but at the same time needed [...] "an abnormally large voice".|$|E
500|$|Hindustan Times writer Robin Bansal was {{impressed}} with the song, and called it [...] "eclectic, peppy, and electrifying from the start... The song explodes after a point in its massiveness and stays in the head. The impeccable notes and pitch makes one wonder if it's really Priyanka." [...] He added that the song had a high tempo and pitch, making it more like a track by The Black Eyed Peas. Chopra refuted the claims that her voice was digitally modulated, and said she has a high range <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> and that she always had an accent while speaking English. Perdy Mohindru from The Times of India described the lyrics as simple and beautiful, and complemented Chopra's accent and voice.|$|E
500|$|... "I Miss You" [...] was {{generally}} praised by music critics who complimented its very sparse production {{as well as}} its aurally remarkable 1980s influence. Some of them also described the song as a [...] "haunting" [...] ballad and called it the highlight of the record. Critics also complimented how Beyoncé's vocals keep on alternating from desperate and calm [...] throughout the song, and highlighted the vulnerability <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> Following the release of 4 in early July 2011, [...] "I Miss You" [...] charted at number 184 on the UK Singles Chart and at number 34 on the South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart, based on downloads alone.

500|$|However Lloyd Webber {{was still}} wary about Madonna's singing, so after {{securing}} the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader. Since Evita required the actors to sing their own parts, the training helped in increasing Madonna's {{confidence in the}} songs. Lader noted that the singer [...] "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater— its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had." [...] She taught Madonna how to sing using her diaphragm rather than just her throat, enabling her to project her voice in a more cohesive manner. Madonna was thrilled to find the newly discovered nuances <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> and would go home every night, practicing by telephoning her friends and singing to them.|$|E
500|$|... "Missing You" [...] is an electropop song {{incorporating}} {{elements of}} trance and synthpop. It {{was written by}} Lukas Hilbert and Alexander Kronlund. According to the group [...] "it's about being in a relationship where the passion has gone – so you're missing that spark. It's quite deep, actually, for a pop song." [...] The critics also agreed, calling the lyrics [...] "surprisingly dark". It has also been described as [...] "experimental" [...] and an [...] "updated version" [...] of their previous sound. The production was described as [...] "pretty" [...] but [...] "limp" [...] as the [...] "melody is traded for a random 'miss, missing you' refrain". Some of the group also make use of Auto-Tune on their vocals, mainly Frankie Sandford, whilst Mollie King uses the natural croak <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> and Vanessa White's vocals had a nasal tone. White sings lead vocals on the first chorus, Healy sings lead vocals on the second chorus and Wiseman sings lead vocals on {{the third and final}} chorus.|$|E
500|$|At {{the local}} courthouse, a {{psychiatrist}} explains that Norman murdered Mrs. Bates and her lover ten years prior out of jealousy. Unable {{to bear the}} guilt, he exhumed her corpse and began to treat it {{as if she were}} still alive. In order to preserve that illusion, he recreated his mother in his own mind as an alternate personality, often dressing in her clothes and talking to himself <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> This [...] "Mother" [...] personality is jealous and possessive: whenever Norman feels attracted to a woman, [...] "Mother" [...] kills her. As [...] "Mother", Norman had killed two young girls prior to Marion, as well as Arbogast. The psychiatrist says the [...] "Mother" [...] personality has taken permanent hold of Norman's mind. While Norman sits in a holding cell, [...] "Mother" [...] protests that the murders were Norman's doing and that she [...] "wouldn't even harm a fly."

[...] > Review|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=May 9, 2010|first=Heather|last=Phares}} Phares added, [...] "She is just as accomplished on the EP's ballads". Bill Lamb of About.com disagreed and stated, [...] "the two ballad songs, 'When I Look At You' and 'Obsessed,' feel like throwaways. Miley Cyrus did have a big hit with the highly inspirational 'The Climb,' but the ballads here flush out the distinctiveness <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> and simply feel ordinary." [...] Michael Hann of the English newspaper The Guardian referred to [...] "When I Look at You" [...] {{as one of the}} [...] "inferior ballads" [...] on The Time of Our Lives.

500|$|Director Chris Buck {{believed}} that Menzel's vocals would {{help in the}} portrayal of the character, saying, [...] "Idina {{has a sense of}} vulnerability <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> She plays a very strong character, but someone who lives in fear—so we needed someone who could portray both sides of the character, and Idina was just amazing." [...] Menzel was unaccustomed to working with animated films and being required to portray her character's feelings with her voice alone, though she did not find it particularly challenging. While recording, she was able to [...] "play" [...] with her voice, trying various tones to establish the ranges in Elsa's emotions. For example, Menzel wanted there to be a difference between the ways she sounded when she was being bold and when she was angry. She would also physically restrict her hands from moving as she recorded the film's early scenes in order to project how her character was [...] "so afraid to move and feel anything that it would come out and hurt people".|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Single Ladies", Beyoncé {{emphasizes}} her {{aggressive and}} sensual alter ego Sasha Fierce. She displays much attitude <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> {{as stated by}} Nick Levine of Digital Spy. Echoing Levine's sentiments, Liss wrote that Beyoncé sounds [...] "gleefully sassy". The lyrics reflect post-breakup situations. Accompanied by robotic-like sounds, the opening lines of the song are call and response; Beyoncé chants, [...] "All the single ladies", and background singers echo the line each time. In the first verse, Beyoncé narrates the recent end to a poor relationship after she [...] "cried [...] tears for three good years". She reclaims her right to flirt, have fun, and find a lover who is more devoted than the previous one. Beyoncé goes out to celebrate with her friends in a club where she meets a new love interest. However, her former boyfriend is watching her, and she directs the song to him. She then sings the chorus, which uses minor chords and contains several hooks, [...] "If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it... Oh oh oh".|$|E
