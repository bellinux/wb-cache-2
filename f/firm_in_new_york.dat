Previously, from 1835 through 1839, Bufford owned his own <b>firm</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> under the title Bufford Lithographer. By the end of 1844 through 1851, the Boston company name was changed to J. H. Bufford & Co.

25|$|Some sources {{claim that}} the stained glass was {{designed}} and manufactured by Louis Comfort Tiffany and his <b>firm</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City.

500|$|According to {{architectural}} historian Willis L. Hall, the church's 20 large {{stained glass}} windows [...] "are as much {{a feature of the}} church as the mosaics". [...] The windows, designed by Frederick Stymetz Lamb (1863–1928) and fabricated by J Lamb Studios, his father's <b>firm</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City, took three years to complete, and eight months to install at Stanford. [...] Jane Stanford hired Lamb because she felt he was more interested in [...] "the ecclesiastical rather than commercial aspect of the work". [...] The installation of the windows at Stanford Memorial Church was the largest enterprise of its kind at the time, and the project {{is considered one of the}} best examples of Lamb's work. [...] Stanford chose the life of Christ for the windows' theme, inspired by the religious paintings by European master painters such as Shields and Doré. [...] Her personal touch is shown in one of the nave windows, which is based on a cartoon by Paoletti and depicts Christ welcoming the soul of a child into Heaven before the eyes of its grieving mother, an allusion to the death of Leland Stanford, Jr., the Stanfords' only child and the university's namesake, who died in 1884 of typhoid shortly before his 16th birthday.|$|E

60|$|And when, {{going to}} his {{dressing}} room {{to get ready for}} dinner, he had nearly run into Spike Mullins, Red Spike of shameful memory, his frame of mind had been that of a man to whom a sudden ray of light reveals {{the fact that he is}} on the very brink of a black precipice. Jimmy and Spike had been a <b>firm</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> And here they were, together again, in his house in Shropshire. To say that the thing struck McEachern as sinister is to put the matter baldly. There was once a gentleman who remarked that he smelt a rat and saw it floating in the air. Ex-constable McEachern smelt a regiment of rats, and the air seemed to him positively congested with them.|$|E
60|$|Like most lawyers, {{he had a}} vein of romance, {{and this}} now opened in {{pleasing}} conjectures concerning the girl. He knew just where Lower Merritt was, and so well {{what it was like}} that a vision of its white paint against the dark green curtain of the wooded heights around it filled his sense as agreeably as so much white marble. There was the cottage of some summer people well above the village level, among pines and birches, and overlooking the foamiest rush of the Saco, to which he instantly destined the piano of Phyllis Desmond. He had never known that these people's name was Desmond, and he had certainly never supposed that they had a daughter called Phyllis; but he divined these facts in losing sight of the truck; and he imagined with as logical probability that one of the little girls whom he used to see playing on the hill-slope before the cottage had grown up into the young lady whose name the piano bore. There was quite time enough for this transformation; it was seven years since Gaites had run up into the White Mountains for a month's rest after his last term in the Harvard Law School, and before beginning work {{in the office of the}} law <b>firm</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> where he had got a clerkship, and where he had now a junior partnership. The little girl was then just ten years old, and now, of course, the young lady was seventeen, or would be when the piano reached Lower Merritt, for it was clearly meant to arrive on her birthday; it was a birthday-present and a surprise. He had always liked the way those nice people let their children play about barefoot; it would be in character with them to do a fond, pretty thing like that; and Gaites smiled for pleasure in it, and then rather blushed in relating the brown legs of the little girl, as he remembered seeing them in her races over her father's lawn, to the dignified young lady she had now become.|$|E
