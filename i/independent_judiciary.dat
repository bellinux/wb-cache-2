5|$|Judicial: India has {{a unitary}} three-tier <b>independent</b> <b>judiciary</b> that {{comprises}} the Supreme Court, {{headed by the}} Chief Justice of India, 24 High Courts, {{and a large number}} of trial courts. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre; it has appellate jurisdiction over the High Courts. It has the power both to declare the law and to strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution, as well as to invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Other {{difficulties}} arose {{when the}} Empire's parliament, the General Assembly, opened in 1826. PedroI, {{along with a}} significant percentage of the legislature, argued for an <b>independent</b> <b>judiciary,</b> a popularly elected legislature and a government which would be led by the emperor who held broad executive powers and prerogatives. Others in parliament argued for a similar structure, only with a less influential role for the monarch and the legislative branch being dominant in policy and governance. The struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on the establishment of the governmental and political structure. Unable to deal with the problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, PedroII, on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.|$|E
5|$|The SPC is {{the highest}} court for appeal and review, and it reports to the National Assembly, which {{controls}} the judiciary's budget and confirms the president's nominees to the SPC and SPP. The SPP issues arrest warrants, sometimes retroactively. Below the SPC are district and provincial people's courts, military tribunals, and administrative, economic and labor courts. The people's courts are the courts of first instance. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has military tribunals, which have the same rules as civil courts. Military judges and assessors are selected by the MOD and the SPC, but the SPC has supervisory responsibility. Although the constitution provides for independent judges and lay assessors (who lack administrative training), the United States Department of State maintains that Vietnam lacks an <b>independent</b> <b>judiciary,</b> {{in part because the}} Communist Party selects judges and vets them for political reliability. Moreover, the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party's dominant position. In an effort to increase judicial independence, the government transferred local courts from the Ministry of Justice to the SPC in September 2002. However, the Department of State saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal. Vietnam's judiciary is also hampered by a shortage of lawyers and by rudimentary trial procedures. The death penalty often is imposed in cases of corruption and drug trafficking.|$|E
50|$|Democratic governments {{seem to be}} spreading, though are not yet the {{majority}} (National Geographic claims 13 African nations can be considered truly democratic).

40|$|Following the {{collapse}} of communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, constitutional designers codified rules establishing <b>independent</b> <b>judiciaries.</b> To what degree do these constitutional and statutory guarantees of independence reflect the actual behavior of courts? Our analysis demonstrates that official judicial power does not predict expressions of judicial reviewâ€” overturning legislation {{in whole or in}} part. Rather, exogenous factors, including economic conditions, executive power, identity of the litigants and legal issues, influence the likelihood that courts will nullify laws. Our findings should caution both scholars and institutional designers. Both formal and informal factors create the parameters in which courts operate. Although courts have become more powerful institutions in the post-communist era, they face a diverse set of constraints on independ-ent action. Although <b>independent</b> <b>judiciaries</b> are important actors in democratic consoli-dation, how expressions of judicial independence evolve in transitional societies remains unclear. Ideally, courts review legislation and government decisions under the rubric of constitutionality. That is, the judiciary is able to declare laws and actions unconstitutional and serve as a check against excesses by othe...|$|R

40|$|Economics has firms maximizing {{value and}} people maximizing utility, but firms {{are run by}} people. Agency theory {{concerns}} the mitigation of this internal contradiction in capitalism. Firms need charters, regulations and laws to restrain those entrusted with their governance, just as economies need constitutions and <b>independent</b> <b>judiciaries</b> to restrain those entrusted with government. Agency problems distort capital allocation if corporate insiders are inefficiently selected or incentivized, and this hampers economic growth absent a legal system with appropriate constraints. However, political economy problems and agency problems in corporations may reinforce each other, compromising the quality of both corporate governance and government. ...|$|R

25|$|Upon declaring Gibraltar to be a Crown {{colony in}} 1830, The Crown {{established}} an <b>independent</b> <b>judiciary</b> and a Supreme Court of Justice.

40|$|This article {{challenges}} {{the view of}} many commentators that the capacity of liberal democracies to regulate international migration has been significantly compromised by the growth of international human rights norms and the role of <b>independent</b> <b>judiciaries</b> in enforcing those norms. Focusing on three Australian case studies that deal with deportation, mandatory detention of refugee claimants, and judicial review of migration decisions, the article concludes that international and domestic legal constraints still leave very substantial latitude to liberal democratic States to regulate the size and composition of international immigration flows. With only modest qualifications, migration policy remains 'the last major redoubt of unfettered national sovereignty'. 35 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Because {{courts are}} both conflict-resolving and lawmaking bodies, {{they should be}} both {{independent}} and accountable. This paradox of incidence and accountability cannot be resolved but only addressed by various and shifting pragmatic accommodations between independence and accountability. Prosecutors, trial courts, appeals courts, and constitutional courts are each subject to differing consideration in arriving at such accommodations. Moreover, courts, as courts of law, are not independent but are agents of statutory and constitutional lawmakers. Excessive emphasis on judicial independence creates the danger that authoritarian regimes may achieve a cloak of legitimacy for their laws by having them enforced by <b>independent</b> <b>judiciaries.</b> Globalization and the Law: The Next Twenty Years, Indiana University Maurer School of Law, Bloomington, Indiana, April 5 - 6, 2012...|$|R
25|$|Also, an {{extremely}} <b>independent</b> <b>judiciary</b> would lack judicial accountability, {{which is the}} duty of a public decision-maker to explain and justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or harm. Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure that justice is upheld.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{scrutiny}} {{of the criminal justice}} system occurs when a person on trial is a political opponent of the executive government. The pertinent question here, which is extremely difficult to answer, is whether the judge presiding over that particular case would have arrived at his decision in a different manner if the accused had not been a political opponent. However, the impartiality of the judiciary cannot necessarily be impugned on the ground that the courts have to enforce laws or rules of evidence and procedure that are felt to be unjust, because even the most <b>independent</b> <b>judiciary</b> must comply with laws enacted by the legislature.|$|E

40|$|Democracy {{is often}} fragile, {{especially}} {{in states that}} have recently experienced civil conflict. To protect emerging democracies, many scholars and practitioners recommend political powersharing institutions. Yet there is little empirical research on whether powersharing promotes democratic survival, and some concern that it can limit electoral accountability. To fill this gap, we differentiate between inclusive, dispersive, and constraining powersharing and analyze their effects on democratic survival using a new global dataset. We find sharp distinctions across types of powersharing and political context. Inclusive powersharing, such as ethnic quotas, promotes democratic survival only in post-conflict settings. In contrast, dispersive institutions such as federalism destabilize post-conflict democracies. Only constraining powersharing consistently facilitates democratic survival in societies both with and without recent conflict. Our results suggest that institution-builders and international organizations should prioritize institutions that constrain leaders, including <b>independent</b> <b>judiciaries,</b> civilian control of the armed forces, and constitutional protections of individual and group rights...|$|R
