40|$|Solideal is an {{international}} <b>industrial</b> <b>tire</b> manufacturer. The tires are built in molds and are produced in heaters in large series production runs. Some tires can be cured in {{two different types of}} heaters. Preparing a heater for a specific tire type requires a set up which typically only takes place during the morning shift. Therefore, the company employs to a discrete production policy. The resulting scheduling problem is a capacitated, multi-item lot sizing problem with set up times and multiple non-identical alternative machines. The objective is the minimization of the total costs for set up, backlog and inventory. Management opted for a fast algorithm that could produce various alternative high quality solutions. The problem is solved using a column generation scheme where the master is solved approximately using Lagrange relaxation. During the column generation process, various heuristic integer solutions are created from which the schedulers can then choose one to implement. We present computational results on real life data with up to 30 products and 30 periods. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Loadstar(pvt) Ltd {{is one of}} {{the leading}} <b>industrial</b> <b>tire,</b> wheel and track {{manufacturers}} in Sri Lanka which started as a small company and became the number one solid tire exporter in the world today. This study was carried out to identify the growth of the company as a result of efficient acquisition and assimilation of technology in line with business strategies. Measuring instruments were designed to assess acquisition of technology knowledge in products and processes as well as the growth stage of acquired technologies and its transfer status to Loadstar. In addition, study focused on assessing acquisition of capabilities such as Design Engineering, R&D, Production and Selling and Servicing. Furthermore, balanced scorecard management tool was used to study the behavior of key business parameters such as Turnover growth, Internal growth in product and technologies, Level of customer satisfaction and growth in employment and training. Literature survey shows the analysis of technology based development of a manufacturing company mainly requires proper understanding of technology components. It also indicates that successful acquisition of identified technologies heavily relies on the level of acquiring core capabilities as well as supporting capabilities. Concepts such as "Technology ball" and "Technology based development of a firm" indicate the acquisition of knowledge and level of technology transfer with time respectively. Study revealed that Loadstar has successfully acquired process technology capabilities from its inception and moved on to acquiring R&D capabilities, especially in material development and bias ply pneumatic tire design after 1998. It was also found that Loadstar's capability in Solid tire product development is quite low,' even though it carries the considerable market share compared to pneumatic tires. Further, study revealed that Loadstar lacks Selling and servicing capability which {{is one of the}} core capabilities to add value to the product. Based on analysis and conclusions, it is recommended that Loadstar need to strengthen its R&D in Solid tire products, as well as company should boost its involvement of innovation and development of radical technologies in its all product groups. Further, process technology should be strengthened by improving work facilitation and modification capabilities. In addition, company should focus on acquiring Selling and Servicing capabilities to work closely with customers to add more value to the product...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to clarify the {{influence}} of the clinker SO 3 on the amount of C 3 A. The calculation of the cement phases percentages is based on the research work, Calculation of the Compounds in Portland Cement, published by Bogue in 1929. The usage of high sulphur fuels, <b>industrial</b> wastes, and <b>tires</b> changes completely the working condition of Bogue because the assumed phase compositions may change. The results prove that increasing the amount of SO 3 in the low alkali clinker decreases the percentages of C 3 A due to the high incorporation of alumina in the clinker phases mainly C 2 S and C 3 S. The correlation is linear till the clinker SO 3 reaches the 2 %. Over that the influence of the clinker SO 3 became undetectable.

40|$|The Swedish road {{administration}} {{requested that}} an independent organization facilitate friction tests with {{several types of}} friction measuring devices. These tests were done on the following three surfaces: macro rough and micro smooth ice, macro- and micro smooth ice and macroand micro rough ice. The objective was to evaluate lateral low slip measuring devices against traditional longitudinal high slip devices. This was done by evaluating how they measure road grip, i. e. friction differences between road surfaces and the measuring tire. Tests were performed on Lake Kakel near Arjeplog, northern Sweden on March 18 th, 2008. Weather conditions were stable with ice temperatures between - 4 °C (24. 8 °F) and - 3 °C (26. 6 °F). Tests showed that changes on the ice surfaces were readily detected with {{all four of the}} lateral low slip friction measurement devices and the two longitudinal high slip devices. Friction resolutions were higher with low lateral slip devices compared to high longitudinal slip devices. The tires on the devices were of different types and are the main reason for the difference in friction resolution. One major difference was detected; the lateral low slip method measured higher friction between its regular winter tire and the macro rough, micro smooth surfacecompared to the friction on the macro- and micro rough ice. Longitudinal high slip devices measured higher friction between its <b>industrial</b> friction <b>tire</b> and macro- and micro rough ice. Capacity to measure friction in curves was only displayed by the high longitudinal slip devices.

40|$|Owing to {{its unique}} {{physical}} properties, rubber plays a keyrole in countless <b>industrial</b> applications. <b>Tires,</b> vibration absorbers and shoe soles are only {{but a few}} of the myriad uses of natural and synthetic rubber in an industry which in 2009 had an estimated market value of 2 billion euro. Despite a peculiar internal structure, the macroscopic behavior of filled-rubber is reminiscent of several biological soft tissues. While rubber is internally constituted by flexible long chain molecules that intertwine with each other, a similar role is played, in soft-tissues, by collagen fiber bundles. As a consequence, both classes of materials are able to sustain large strains and exhibit the characteristics of a viscous fluid and an elastic solid. In industry, the requirement to model complex geometrical structures made of materials exhibiting a nonlinear constitutive behavior is a compelling reason to use Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software. The predictive capabilities of these numerical tools strongly rely upon the capabilities of the underlying model to describe the material’s rheological properties. The possibility of simulating accurately the material behavior over the entire working range avoids the use of excessive number of prototypes, thereby reducing the need for expensive and difficult experimental tests; consequently, development costs can be drastically reduced. The theory of viscoelasticity is crucial in describing materials, such as filled rubber, which exhibit time dependent stress-strain behavior. In many engineering applications, such as the estimate of the rolling resistance of tires and hysteretic losses in soft biological tissues, the energy dissipation is a primary feature to be predicted. In addition, in the usual operative range, tires, shock absorbers and other rubber components bear finite dynamic deformations. Therefore, a reliable constitutive equation must be assessed within the theory of nonlinear viscoelasticity. A review of the literature revealed significantly more well-established studies dealing with hyperelastic constitutive models, than those dealing with finite viscoelasticity. Over the years, many hyperelastic models able to describe all the relevant aspects of the quasi-static response have been introduced. Furthermore, the American norms (ASTM D 412, ASTM D 575, ASTM D 945, ASTM D 6147, ASTM D 1456) establish all the experimental techniques to identify the material constitutive parameters. In this context, many authors have recently addressed the problem of finite amplitude wave propagation or focused their interest upon particular boundary value problems. On the other hand, there is a lack of well-established nonlinear viscoelastic models capable of describing all the relevant effects in the material response. Moreover, a standardization similar to that concerning the static norms is yet to be achieved. The usual methodology provides for small harmonic deformations superimposed on a large static displacement. However, such a prescription does not allow the capture of many of the relevant nonlinear phenomena. In the literature, experimental evidence concerning finite dynamic deformations is rarely reported...|$|R
