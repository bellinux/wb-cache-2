2500|$|While the theatre-going {{public may}} {{consider}} the Tony Awards {{to be the}} Oscars of live theatre, critics {{have suggested that the}} Tony Awards are primarily a promotional vehicle for a small number of large production companies and theatre owners in New York City. In a 2014 Playbill article, Robert Simonson wrote that [...] "Who gets to perform on the Tony Awards broadcast, what they get to perform, and for <b>how</b> <b>long,</b> <b>have</b> long been politically charged questions in the Broadway theatre community..." [...] The producers [...] "accept the situation ... because just as much as actually winning a Tony, a performance that lands well with the viewing public can translate into big box-office sales." [...] Producer Robyn Goodman noted that, if the presentation at the ceremony shows well and the show wins a Tony, [...] "you’re going to spike at the box office".|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} {{previous}} incarnations of the Doctor {{was at first}} unclear within the series. In the Fourth Doctor story The Brain of Morbius, the Doctor participates in a mental ‘duel’ with another Time Lord and the machine to which their minds are connected begins to project {{the faces of the}} [...] "losing" [...] contestant’s regenerations in chronologically descending order. As the Doctor is overpowered by Morbius, the images change successively to those of the third, second and first Doctors, then eight further faces appear. It was the intention of producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes that images were even earlier incarnations of the Doctor. However, the narrative does not explicitly confirm that the faces do represent incarnations of the Doctor, even though, as the faces are shown, Morbius cries [...] "How far Doctor? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> you lived?", indicating that they are not incarnations of Morbius, but rather that it is the Doctor's past being shown.|$|E

[...] said, no, Sir, not more than usual—You have and very well employed too, but there are none so deaf as those that w'ont hear, and none so blind as those that w'ont see— made a low bow, Sir, I certainly now understand you, but was afraid my vanity or presumption might have led me to imagine what Your Majesty has said referred to what I have done—You cannot be vain—You have been of use to us all, it is a general opinion, is it not so Lord Stair? who was standing near. It is said Lord Stair;—Your Majesty's adopting it, Sir, will make the opinion general, said —I know it is the general opinion, and I know that there is no Man who calls himself a Gentleman that must not think himself obliged to you, for you have supported the cause of the Gentlemen—You know the tone at Court is a whisper, but The King said all this loud, so as to be heard by every one at Court.|$|E
