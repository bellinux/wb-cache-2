40|$|The {{question}} 2 ̆ 2 When are research risks reasonable {{in relation}} to anticipated benefits? 2 ̆ 2 {{is at the heart}} of disputes in the ethics of clinical research. Institutional review boards are often criticized for inconsistent decision-making, a problem that is compounded by a number of contemporary controversies, including the ethics of research involving placebo controls, developing countries, <b>incapable</b> <b>adults</b> and emergency rooms. If this pressing ethical question is to be addressed in a principled way, then a systematic approach to the ethics of risk in research is required. Component analysis provides such a systematic approach...|$|R

50|$|Oedancala dorsalis, can {{be found}} living on the seed heads of Carex and Cyperus both as nymphs (resemble adults except they usually have reduced wings and are <b>incapable</b> of flight) and <b>adults.</b> The seed heads allow easy camouflage.

It is a wide range, from Quebec and New England, west to the Dakotas and Colorado and south to Florida and Texas. Rare in Florida.|$|R

40|$|Responding to elder {{abuse is}} not for those who favor a simple life. Situations {{involving}} the mistreatment or self-neglect of older adults are complicated, disturbing, and usually frustrating. They cannot be easily packaged and processed. As a result, it widely believed they require interventions that cross systems and disciplines. This is nothing new. Recognition {{of the need for}} intersystem and interdisciplinary relations to detect, prevent, and treat elder abuse predates official discov-ery of the problem in the mid- 1970 s. It is found in the demonstration projects of the mid- 1960 s aimed at establishing a model of protection for impaired older <b>adults</b> <b>incapable</b> of managing their lives and vulnerable especially to neglect and exploitation. This intervention model, called adult protective services, represented th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Psychopaths are {{renowned for}} their immoral behavior. They are ideal {{candidates}} for testing the empirical plausibility of moral theories. Many think {{the source of}} their immorality is their emotional deficits. Psychopaths experience no guilt or remorse, feel no empathy, and appear to be perfectly rational. If this is true, sentimentalism is supported over rationalism. Here, I examine the nature of psychopathic practical reason and argue that it is impaired. The relevance to morality is discussed. I conclude that rationalists can explain the moral deficits of psychopaths as well as sentimentalists. In the process, I identify psychological structures that underpin practical rationality. Psychopathic individuals are perhaps best known for their flagrant disregard for social and moral norms. A number of psychopathologies are connected with violent and amoral behavior—such as schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder—but the profile of the psychopath is unique. Psychopaths are not subject to the profound disturbances of thoughts characteristic of these other conditions, but appear lucid and rational, yet peculiarly <b>incapable</b> of sustaining <b>adult</b> socialize...|$|R
40|$|Research in the {{intensive}} care unit (ICU) is commonly thought to pose 2 ̆ 7 serious risk 2 ̆ 7 to study participants. This perception may be at the root of a variety of impediments to the conduct of clinical trials in the ICU setting. Component analysis offers a promising approach to the ethical analysis of ICU research. Because clinical trials commonly involve a mixture of study interventions, therapeutic and nontherapeutic procedures must be analyzed separately. Therapeutic procedures must meet the requirement of clinical equipoise. Risks associated with nontherapeutic procedures must be minimized consistent with sound scientific design, and be deemed reasonable in relation to the knowledge to be gained. When research involves a vulnerable population, such as <b>adults</b> <b>incapable</b> of providing informed consent, nontherapeutic risks are limited to a minor increase over minimal risk. Understood in this way, the incremental risk posed by participation in ICU research may be minimal. This realization has important implications for review by institutional review boards of such research and for the informed consent process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{work has}} {{identified}} the enzymes {{involved in the}} activation and conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein NED- 8 in Caenorhabditis elegans. A C. elegans conjugating enzyme, UBC- 12, is highly specific {{in its ability to}} utilize NED- 8 as a substrate. Immunostaining shows that NED- 8 is conjugated in vivo to a major target protein with a conjugate size of 90 kDa. While the amount of this conjugate is developmentally regulated with reduced levels in the larval stages, the mRNA encoding C. elegans UBC- 12 is constitutively produced throughout development, as is NED- 8 itself. The importance of the NED- 8 conjugating system in C. elegans was determined by RNA interference (RNAi) assays using double-stranded RNA encoding NED- 8, UBC- 12, or the NED- 8 activating enzyme component ULA- 1. The progeny of both ned- 8 and ubc- 12 RNAi-treated hermaphrodites either arrested during embryonic development or underwent abnormal postembryonic development. The effect on postembryonic development was pleiotropic, the most frequent gross abnormality being vulval eversion during the L 4 stage. Individuals with an everted vulva either burst at the L 4 to adult molt or gave rise to <b>adults</b> <b>incapable</b> of egg laying. Additionally, both ned- 8 and ubc- 12 RNAi induced a striking abnormality in the alae, structures produced by the lateral hypodermal seam cells in the adult nematode. Affected alae were patchy and frequently diverged around a central space. Vulval defects were also produced by RNAi directed at C. elegans ula- 1. This is the first demonstration of a requirement for NED- 8 conjugation in metazoan development...|$|R
40|$|Japanese beetles are a {{relatively}} new pest to Arkansas. During my Ph. D. research I investigated the pathogens and environmental factors influencing Japanese beetle populations in the state. The prevalence of various pathogens and parasitoids attacking Popillia japonica were recorded annually from wild populations. Of specific interest was the microsporidian pathogen Ovavesicula popilliae, which I introduced as a biological control agent in the state. Details {{of the relationship between}} this pathogen and the Japanese beetle were investigated, including dose response, host range, and spore production. Additionally, annual abundance of the beetle in the region was recorded and tracked over the course of 4 years using soil sampling for larvae and pheromone traps for adults. Outdoor and indoor rearing methods were developed, and the density of these populations were recorded and compared to wild populations and temperature data, allowing us to model climate impact on the beetle. Results from these studies showed that, naturally occurring pathogens, such as Stictospora villani, Ovavesicula popilliae and Adelina sp., and parasitoids appeared to have minimal influence on the beetle populations in this region. In the case of O. popilliae, low levels of the pathogen appeared in the area naturally. This pathogen also has a narrow physiological host range outside of the Japanese beetle, primarily in other scarab larvae. O. popilliae also appears to primarily infect Japanese beetle larvae and was <b>incapable</b> of infecting <b>adult</b> beetles. Infected larvae which survived to adulthood remained infected, with the adults capable of producing on average 25 million spores. In comparison, high summer temperatures and lack of rain reduced late summer populations of larvae. In 2010, O. popilliae was released at four locations in Northwest Arkansas. In 2011 it was detected at one of those locations. A second introduction of O. popilliae was made in 2012. The results from this classical biological control effort involving the release of O. popilliae require further monitoring to confirm establishment. This information can be used to help establish long term control of this new pest in the Southern United States. This information will be of use to fruit growers, horticulturalists, turf managers, nursery operators, and homeowners...|$|R
