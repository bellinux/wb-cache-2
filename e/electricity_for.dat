In {{this paper}} bivariate {{modelling}} methodology, solely {{applied to the}} spot price of <b>electricity</b> or demand <b>for</b> <b>electricity</b> in earlier studies, is extended to a bivariate process of spot price of <b>electricity</b> and demand <b>for</b> <b>electricity.</b> The suggested model accommodates common idiosyncrasies observed in deregulated electricity markets such as cyclical trends in price and demand <b>for</b> <b>electricity,</b> occurrence of extreme spikes in prices, and mean-reversion effect seen in settling of prices from extreme values to the mean level over {{a short period of}} time. The paper presents detailed statistical analysis of historical data of daily averages of electricity spot prices and corresponding demand <b>for</b> <b>electricity.</b> The data is obtained from the NSW section of Australian Energy Markets...|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} {{is powered by}} a gas-powered trigeneration energy plant producing <b>electricity</b> <b>for</b> cooling and heating using water from the ship canal. It is more than twice as efficient as conventional grid electricity and helped the development gain BREEAM sustainable community status.

5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without <b>electricity</b> <b>for</b> hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E

5|$|Although many false {{claims of}} its {{discovery}} were {{made over the}} years, the element was first synthesized by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in 1940. Since then, most neptunium has been and still is produced by neutron irradiation of uranium in nuclear reactors. The vast majority is generated as a by-product in conventional nuclear power reactors. While neptunium itself has no commercial uses at present, it {{is used as a}} precursor for the formation of plutonium-238, used in radioisotope thermal generators to provide <b>electricity</b> <b>for</b> spacecraft. Neptunium has also been used in detectors of high-energy neutrons.|$|E
5|$|As more {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} the Pacific Northwest in the 1930s and 1940s, civic leaders advocated a system of hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River. They argued that the dams would improve navigation for barge traffic from interior regions to the ocean; provide a reliable source of irrigation for agricultural production; provide <b>electricity</b> <b>for</b> the World War II defense industry; and alleviate the flooding of downriver cities, as occurred in the 1948 destruction of Vanport City, Oregon.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{power for the}} tram system, the station {{was a source of}} <b>electricity</b> <b>for</b> local homes. The building of a power station brought major environmental improvements to what was a highly polluted area, because electricity represented a much cleaner source of household energy than coal, which was used at the time. Local households gradually switched to the new power source. A partner in the enterprise of the Lemington power station was Sir Matthew White Ridley, who had considerable interests in coal and banking.|$|E

5|$|Before 1907, all {{magnitude}} {{measurements for}} stars were obtained through visual comparison of relative brightness, {{a process that}} was slow and inexact. Later photographic methods would use starlight to make a representation on a photographic plate. Regardless, neither method was adequate for quantitative measurements. The drawback of previous methods of measuring stellar magnitude made the use of <b>electricity</b> <b>for</b> empirically gathering astronomical data revolutionary for the science of astronomy.

5|$|DisCo built {{a station}} at Lemington, {{in the western}} {{outskirts}} of the city, to provide <b>electricity</b> <b>for</b> a tram line which ran through their supply area, from the City Centre to Throckley. The station was sited amid the derelict buildings of the Tyne Iron Company's ironworks. They had opened in 1797 and closed in 1886. The works were largely demolished, {{but some of the}} ironworks' buildings and chimneys still stood unused, and the power station was built amongst them. DisCo opened Lemington Power Station in 1903.|$|E

The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart.

After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E
5|$|Strong winds from Isabel {{extended}} from North Carolina to New England and westward to West Virginia. The winds, combined with previous rainfall which moistened the soil, downed many trees and power lines across its path, leaving about 6million electricity customers without power at some point. Parts of coastal Virginia, {{especially in the}} Hampton Roads and Northeast North Carolina areas, were without <b>electricity</b> <b>for</b> almost a month. Coastal areas suffered from waves and its powerful storm surge, with areas in eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia reporting severe damage from both winds and the storm surge. Throughout its path, Isabel resulted in $3.6billion in damage (2003USD, $ USD) and 51deaths, of which 16 were {{directly related to the}} storm's effects.|$|E
5|$|Teesside Energy from Waste plant (also {{known as}} Teesside WTE power station or Haverton Hill incinerator) is a {{municipal}} waste incinerator and waste-to-energy power station, which provides 29.2 megawatts (MW) of <b>electricity</b> <b>for</b> the National Grid by burning 390,000 tonnes of household and commercial waste a year.

Tariffs should be increased by about two times the current level for nonresidential consumers and almost three times for households in order to reflect long-run production cost. Interestingly, the estimated reference price is still lower than the <b>electricity</b> tariffs <b>for</b> households in most EU countries. In particular, the reference price of 615.7 UAH/MWh equals 0.064 EUR/kWh. In comparison, the lowest <b>electricity</b> tariff <b>for</b> households (at annual consumption 3500 kWh) was in Latvia, 0.068 EUR/kWh, and the highest in Italy, 0.268 EUR/kWh as of July, 2010 (Europe’s Energy Portal [2010]).|$|R

5|$|The Bucknill Committee, {{which had}} been set up to {{investigate}} the loss of major warships, also produced a report. This report said that the lack of backup power sources was a major design failure, which contributed to the loss: Ark Royal depended on <b>electricity</b> <b>for</b> much of her operation, and once the boilers and steam-driven dynamos were knocked out, the loss of power made damage control difficult. The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces, while the uninterrupted boiler room flat was criticised. The design flaws were rectified in the Illustrious- and Implacable-class carriers, under construction at the time.|$|E
