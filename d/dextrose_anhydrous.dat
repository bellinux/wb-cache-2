40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effects of various dextrose, lactose, and whey sources on weanling pig performance. In Exp. 1, a total of 228 pigs (initially 17. 1 lb) were used in a 14 -d experiment. There were six treatments consisting of a control (corn-soybean meal diet) or the control diet with 7. 2 % lactose, 7. 2 % <b>dextrose</b> <b>anhydrous,</b> 7. 2 % dextrose monohydrate, 10 % feed-grade whey, or 10 % food-grade whey. Pigs were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to treatment after being fed SEW and Transition diets for the first seven days post-weaning. Overall, ADG and d 14 weight were improved (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed lactose or food-grade whey when compared to pigs fed feed-grade whey. There were no other differences in ADG or d 14 weights among the treatments. Average daily feed intake was improved (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed lactose, dextrose monohydrate, or food-grade whey when compared to those fed feed-grade whey. Feed efficiency was improved (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed food-grade whey rather than dextrose monohydrate. For the economic analysis, pigs fed the control diet had the lowest (P< 0. 01) cost per pound of gain, followed by pigs fed dextrose monohydrate, <b>dextrose</b> <b>anhydrous,</b> feed-grade whey, lactose, and food-grade whey. Margin-over-feed cost was improved (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed the control diet rather than the diets containing lactose, <b>dextrose</b> <b>anhydrous,</b> or either whey source. In Exp. 2, a total of 352 pigs (initially 17. 1 lb) were used in a 14 -d experiment to evaluate seven commercial whey sources. There were eight treatments consisting of a corn-soybean meal-based control diet and seven diets containing 10 % whey, each of a different whey source. Pigs were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to treatment after being fed SEW and Transition diets {{for the first five}} days post-weaning. Overall, ADG and d 14 weight were improved (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed whey sources A and E when compared to the control and sources B and D. Pigs fed whey sources C, F, and G had intermediate ADG. Average daily feed intake was greater (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed whey source E rather than the control or whey sources B, C, D, and G. Feed efficiency was improved (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed whey source A rather than the control. Pigs fed the remaining whey sources had intermediate F/G. For the economic analysis, pigs fed the control diet had the lowest cost per pound of gain (P< 0. 01). Margin-over-feed cost was improved (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed the control diet rather than the diets containing whey sources B, D, and G. Pigs fed whey source A had intermediate MOF that was also greater (P< 0. 05) than that of pigs fed whey sources B and D. In conclusion, differences in the growth performance of pigs fed various whey (or lactose) and dextrose sources exist. The quality, cost, and relative feeding value of lactose sources should be considered when formulating diets for nursery pigs. In some cases, especially with the current high price of dried whey, feeding a Phase 2 diet containing no added source of lactose may be a more economical option despite the slight reduction in growth performance...|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{the most}} popular types of added sugar are sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup, both {{primarily}} composed of about half glucose and half fructose. Other types of added sugar include: all types of beet and cane sugars, all types of corn syrup (including solids), malt syrup, maple syrup, pancake syrup, fructose sweetener, liquid fructose, fruit juice concentrate, honey, molasses, <b>anhydrous</b> <b>dextrose,</b> and crystal dextrose. The most common types of foods containing added sugars are sweetened beverages, including most soft drinks. In the US, 20% of daily calorie consumption comes from that single source. The World Health Organization recommends that this number should be no higher than 10%. 13% of American population receives over 25% of their calories from added sugars, which often means they are not getting enough of other key nutrients.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{have found that}} increasing circulating glucose availability can increase memory performance in rodents, healthy humans, and individuals with dementia of the Alzheimer's type. In this study, patients with schizophrenia, healthy control subjects, and controls with bipolar affective disorder were tested using double-blind treatment with either 50 g <b>anhydrous</b> <b>dextrose</b> plus 4 mg sodium saccharin (for &quot;taste&quot;) or 23. 7 mg saccharin alone, followed by cognitive testing on a complex battery. At this glucose dose, verbal memory performance on a paragraph recall task was increased during the glucose condition relative to the saccharin condition in the patients with schizophrenia; this effect was not detected hi either the psychiatric or normal controls. The results provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that memory performance can be improved in patients with schizophrenia by increasing circulating glucose availability and suggest the importance of further evaluation of therapeutic manipulations of glucose availability...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Both human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) and {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) bear a great potential in regenerative medicine. In addition to optimized clinical grade culture conditions, efficient clinical grade cryopreservation methods for these cells are needed. Obtaining good survival after thawing has been problematic. METHODS We used a novel, chemically defined effective xeno-free cryopreservation system for cryostorage and banking of hESCs and iPSCs. The earlier established slow freezing protocols have, even after recent improvements, resulted in low viability and thawed cells had a high tendency to differentiate. The medium is a completely serum and animal substance free product containing dimethylsulfoxide, <b>anhydrous</b> <b>dextrose</b> and a polymer as cryoprotectants. The cells were directly frozen at − 70 °C, without a programmed freezer. RESULTS The number of frozen colonies versus the number of surviving colonies differed significantly for both HS 293 (χ 2 = 9. 616 with one degree of freedom and two-tailed P = 0. 0019) and HS 306 (χ 2 = 8. 801 with one degree of freedom and two-tailed P = 0. 0030). After thawing, the cells had a high viability (90 - 96 %) without any impact on proliferation and differentiation, compared with the standard freezing procedure where viability was much lower (49 %). The frozen-thawed hESCs and iPSCs had normal karyotype and maintained properties of pluripotent cells with corresponding morphological characteristics, and expressed pluripotency markers after 10 passages in culture. They formed teratomas containing tissue components of the three germ layers. CONCLUSION The defined freezing-thawing system described here offers an excellent simple option for banking of hESCs and iPSC...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{optimize}} a xeno-free cryopreservation {{protocol for}} primary human hepatocytes. METHODS: The demand for cryopreserved hepatocytes is increasing for both clinical and research purposes. Despite several hepatocyte cryopreservation protocols being available, improvements are urgently needed. We first compared controlled rate freezing to polystyrene box freezing {{and did not}} find any significant change between the groups. Using the polystyrene box freezing, we compared two xeno-free freezing solutions for freezing of primary human hepatocytes: a new medium (STEM-CELLBANKER, CB), which contains dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and <b>anhydrous</b> <b>dextrose,</b> both permeating and non-permeating cryoprotectants, and the frequently used DMSO - University of Wisconsin (DMSO-UW) medium. The viability of the hepatocytes was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion method as well as a calcein-esterase based live-dead assay before and after cryopreservation. The function of the hepatocytes was evaluated before and after cryopreservation by assessing enzymatic activity of 6 major cytochrome P 450 isoforms (CYPs) : CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 C 19, CYP 2 D 6, CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 3 A 7. RESULTS: The new cryoprotectant combination preserved hepatocyte viability significantly better than the standard DMSO-UW protocol (P < 0. 01). There {{was no significant difference in}} viability estimation between both the trypan blue (TB) and the Live-Dead Assay methods. There was a correlation between viability of fresh hepatocytes and the difference in cell viability between CB and DMSO protocols (r 2 = 0. 69) using the TB method. However, due to high within-group variability in the activities of the major CYPs, any statistical between-group differences were precluded. Cryopreservation of human hepatocytes using the cryoprotectant combination was a simple and xeno-free procedure yielding better hepatocyte viability. Thus, it may be a better alternative to the standard DMSO-UW protocol. Estimating CYP activities did not seem to be a relevant way to compare hepatocyte function between different groups due to high normal variability between different liver samples. CONCLUSION: The cryoprotectant combination may be a better alternative to the standard DMSO-UW protocol in primary human hepatocyte cryopreservation...|$|R
