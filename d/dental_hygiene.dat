One fifth of the world's population are adolescents, defined by WHO as the age group 10 to 19 years which is an important target group for the development of dental and oral health. Oral hygiene can be determined through measurement of oral hygiene status. Measurement of oral hygiene status commonly usedare the Oral Hygiene Indeks Simplified (OHI-S) by Green and Vermillion. To prevent the occurrence of caries in the community, then maintaining oral hygiene from an early age is necessary for young children that have the potential to contribute to the welfare of children and families. As for the one that affects the dental health status is the living environment. The research goals of this research is to determine the differences in <b>dental</b> and oral <b>hygiene</b> status in adolescents aged 15 years in urban and rural areas city of Palu. The method used is a pathfinder pilot survey. Type of research used is observational analytic with cross sectional study design. Shows that in rural areas, more male respondents have medium <b>dental</b> and oral <b>hygiene</b> (75 %), while most of the female respondents have low <b>dental</b> and oral <b>hygiene</b> status (62. 5 %). In urban areas, more male respondents have good oral hygiene status (67. 5 %), while most of the female respondents have good oral hygiene status (62. 5 %).

40|$|Objective This {{study was}} done to compare the <b>dental</b> and oral <b>hygiene</b> status of {{children}} with and without congenital heart dis- ease (CHD) by investigating oral microorganisms and <b>dental</b> and oral <b>hygiene</b> indices. Methods A cross-sectional study was done on children aged 2 to 15 years from April 2002 to December 2003 at the Department of Child Health, Haji Adam Malik Hospital, Medan. There were two subject groups, the first consisting of children with CHD and the second of those without. The <b>dental</b> and oral <b>hygiene</b> status was determined by determining caries index and oral hygiene index. Swabs from the subjects’ upper first molars were taken and cul- tured to determine the types of microorganisms present. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test, and t-test. Results There {{was a significant difference}} in mean oral hygiene index between children with (mean 2. 75; SD 1. 85) and without (mean 1. 45; SD 0. 78) CHD (P< 0. 001). Positive bacterial cultures were more frequent in children with CHD than in those without. The proportion of normal anaerobes was significantly higher in chil- dren with CHD (P= 0. 038). Such a significant difference was not found for normal aerobes, pathogenic aerobes, and pathogenic anaerobes. In children with CHD, there was no significant asso- ciation between mean caries index and oral hygiene index with culture results. In those without CHD, a significant association was found between the caries index components of decayed tooth in- dex (P= 0. 003) and DMF-T (P= 0. 022) with culture results. Conclusions Oral-dental hygiene in children with CHD is poor relative to that in children without CHD. Microorganism growth ap- pears more likely in children with CHD than in those withou...|$|R

To reduce the patient exposure {{as much as}} possible it is mandatory {{to reduce the number of}} retakes both in radiology clinics and educational centers. Materials and Methods: 3188 periapical radiographs taken by bisect-angle technique was evaluated in this cross-sectional study to assess the frequent errors necessitating retakes. Views were taken by fourth year dental students using bisect angle method. Errors were tabled according to site and type. Results: The four major errors that were found in the study included incorrect film placement (35. 4 %), cone cutting (18. 2 %), incorrect horizontal angulation (16. 6 %), and incorrect vertical angulation (14. 4 %). The distribution of technical errors by anatomic location was identified. Maxillary molar area was the most occurring site for errors.
