5|$|Following {{the death}} of Louis in 1979, the Horch family sold the Master Building to a real estate investor, Sol Goldman, {{who was then the}} city's largest private landlord. Goldman {{continued}} to operate the building as rental apartments until 1982 when he formed a company, Manhattan Master Apartment Associates, to convert it to a <b>housing</b> <b>co-operative.</b> The conversion was completed in 1988 when that company transferred control to a new organization, Master Apartments, Inc.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{people moved}} out of the {{surrounding}} Manhattan Valley neighborhood. Consequently, the Master Apartments' museum and cultural center closed by 1971, their holdings dispersed elsewhere, although the building's auditorium was still used for cultural events. After Louis's death in 1979, the building was bought by real estate investor Sol Goldman, who converted it to a <b>housing</b> <b>co-operative</b> over the next decade. Further renovations, which were completed in 2005, resulted in many of the one-bedroom studios being combined into two- and three-bedroom units. These renovations attracted more families and made the building more luxurious by both quality-of-life and purchase-price measures. The Master Apartments was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.|$|E

40|$|The {{roles of}} the various governments have been {{the driving force of}} the <b>housing</b> <b>co-operatives</b> in those {{countries}} due to the tremendous support received. The implication is that the <b>housing</b> <b>co-operatives</b> in any country cannot do it alone without the support of government in areas such as having legislation and policies, providing support services and embarking on regular education and training. The need to explore the <b>housing</b> <b>co-operatives</b> in South Africa with a view to determine the successes recorded over the years becomes imperative in order to advance strategies that will ensure virile and sustainable <b>housing</b> <b>co-operatives.</b> Results revealed that a lack of understanding exists as a result of inadequate information among government officials responsible for housing delivery and the public in the application of <b>co-operative</b> <b>housing</b> as a delivery approach. Also, inadequate training of co-operative members in leadership positions lead to a lack of administrative and management capabilities in the processes and operations of <b>housing</b> <b>co-operatives.</b> A pragmatic approach should be adopted so that legislation and policies that are beneficial to the <b>housing</b> <b>co-operatives</b> be enacted...|$|R

In all, efforts were put in by the <b>housing</b> <b>co-operatives</b> in engendering the ideology of co-operatives on one hand and the government on the other hand in providing the necessary subsidy so that the gap in the housing deficit could be bridged since this fitted its policy on housing.   </span...|$|R

40|$|While South Africa has the {{necessary}} legislative and policy frameworks in housing and other sectors {{that could have}} contributed to the development of <b>co-operative</b> <b>housing</b> approach, little is done to promote it.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of people are in need of housing that would improve long-term tenure for them. Private ownership is a well-known incentive for peoples’ participation in housing programmes. The current difficulties in obtaining credit for housing, following the global economic crisis, show that private individual home-ownership is not effective enough in addressing the housing needs of the low and middle income groups. As a result of this, the need to find an option that will solve the housing needs of the people became intense. However, the implementation of the <b>co-operative</b> <b>housing</b> delivery option in South Africa has not been successfully implemented {{as a result of the}} actions or the inactions of the role players. The study sought answer to the causes of the inability to successfully implement the <b>co-operative</b> <b>housing</b> approach through the use of ‘triad model’ that has to do with the ideology of co-operatives, the praxis and the organisational structures of the various <b>housing</b> <b>co-operatives.</b> The study was domiciled in a pragmatic paradigm, using the mixed methods research approach by conducting a three-stage research whereby convergent parallel design was adopted as the methodology. Questionnaires were administered to the chairpersons of the <b>housing</b> <b>co-operatives</b> identified in this stage one of the study. Stage two consisted of conducting interviews with chairpersons of six <b>housing</b> <b>co-operatives</b> using the purposive non-probability sampling method. The final stage was the survey among the members of the <b>housing</b> <b>co-operatives</b> interviewed. It was discovered, inter alia, that the membership of <b>housing</b> <b>co-operatives</b> was not voluntary; policy and legislative documents on social housing were biased against the <b>co-operative</b> <b>housing</b> approach; limited understanding of the co-operative approach exists among officials of government responsible for the implementations and a lack of training to members of the <b>housing</b> <b>co-operatives</b> by agencies of government responsible for propagating the approach was evident. Based on the findings, framework for sustainable <b>housing</b> <b>co-operatives</b> in South Africa was proposed from the strategies identified.

2500|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>housing</b> <b>co-operative</b> {{financing}} methods, market rate and limited equity. [...] With market rate, the share price is allowed to rise {{on the open market}} and shareholders may sell at whatever price the market will bear when they want to move out. [...] In many ways market rate is thus similar financially to owning a condominium, with the difference being that often the co-op may carry a mortgage, resulting in a much higher monthly fee paid to the co-op than would be so in a condominium. [...] The purchase price of a comparable unit in the co-op is typically much lower, however.|$|E

2500|$|In Alberta, {{ownership}} co-ops {{were introduced}} in 1987 with {{the building of a}} twin high-rise tower development in Edmonton (Riverwind Strata Title <b>Housing</b> <b>Co-operative).</b> Subsequently ownership co-ops have been developed and built in other urban centres such as Calgary, Fort Saskatchewan, Canmore and Banff. The individual units within these co-op developments are sub-divided by using the strata title provision of the Land Titles Act, thus creating individual three-dimensional strata lots. This strata sub-division is registered at Land Titles, thus creating [...] "air" [...] lots which have the same properties as more commonly known two-dimensional land lots. In this fashion, co-op members can purchase their individual units and can register a mortgage on title. Like the continuing co-op's, ownership co-op's can be any housing form.
