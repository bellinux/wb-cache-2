40|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of research in marketing has treated commitment as a one or two dimensional construct and largely disregarded temporal effects when investigating the relationship between satisfaction, commitment and customer loyalty. This under-specification of the commitment construct and cross-sectional nature of studies {{has the potential to}} misrepresent these relationships. This research uses a three-component model of commitment (affective, calculative, normative) and situational triggers to examine their impact on customers’ share of wallet (SOW). The data consists of 269 households whose banking relationships were tracked for two years. The results showed that changes in affective, calculative and normative commitment each have a significant positive association with change in share of wallet when one adjusts for the effects of customer characteristics such as age and tenure with company. The baseline level of calculative commitment, and changes in affective commitment provide the best explanations for changes in SOW, and when this <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>commitment</b> is used, contemporaneous changes in satisfaction has no significant incremental value as a predictor for changes in SOW. Finally the analysis reveals a two-segment customer model which demonstrates how managers can be misled if they assume that everyone will react to satisfaction and commitment improvement efforts similarly.

The impact of <b>information</b> sharing <b>on</b> <b>commitment</b> is confirmed with a medium effect size.

However, information sharing plays a much stronger role than training and development or encouraging teamwork. This indicates that coaches should pay significant attention to information sharing.|$|R

The paper begins with brief outlines of how the internet is transforming consumer behaviour and retail operations and of the possible environmental impacts of e-retailing and a short discussion of environmental sustainability. The paper draws its empirical material from the most recent <b>information</b> <b>on</b> environmental sustainability posted on the world’s leading e-retailers’ corporate web sites.

However the authors argue that these commitments can be interpreted as being constructed around the search for operational efficiencies and cost reductions and being driven by business imperatives more than any genuine commitment to environmental sustainability. More critically the authors argue that these commitments are driven more by the search for efficiency gains, that they are couched within existing business models centred on continuing growth and that as such the world’s leading e-retailers are, at best, currently pursuing a ‘weak’ rather than a ‘strong’ model of sustainability...|$|R

The paper draws its empirical material from the most recent <b>information</b> <b>on</b> sustainability posted on the UK's leading data centre operators' corporate web sites. Findings - The findings reveal that all the UK's leading data centre operators provide only limited <b>information</b> <b>on</b> their <b>commitment</b> to sustainability with the dominant focus being on its environmental dimension and with little attention being paid to social and economic issues. More critically the authors argue that these commitments are driven more by the search for efficiency gains, that they are couched within existing business models centred on continuing growth and that as such the UK's leading data centre operators are pursuing a "weak" rather than a "strong" model of sustainability.

For the elements partially addressed [...] personnel stability, training operations tempo, and deployed equipment [...] reporting was incomplete because some services reported information and others did not report.

For example, the Army now requires commanders to report monthly on the readiness impacts of borrowed military manpower and DOD's budget requests include data on training funding. However, DOD has not taken steps to analyze whether this information could be used to meet the related reporting element.

The default status of the credit line is found to be the primary factor driving credit line usage, and this effect increases as the firm approaches default. Another influential factor seems to be an aging effect in which firms reduce their usage as the line ages.

Many aspects of M/M behavior in response to different metabolic challenges still need clarification. Notably, morphological features provide <b>information</b> <b>on</b> the functional <b>commitment</b> of M/M [11 - 13]. The ability to obtain a morphological description that may increase the insight on M/M functional meaning in brain pathology is thus a priority. M/M activation is usually measured, assessing the expression of specific M/M markers (CD 11 b, Iba 1, F 4 / 80) by immunohistochemistry [14]. This approach, however, does not take into consideration morphological changes that could unravel specific M/M functions after brain damage. Actin polymerization, leading to microglia shape transformations, has been demonstrated to be an ATP-dependent process [15, 16]. This is at variance with what happens in macrophages that are better equipped to maintain the functionality in hypoxic/ischemic conditions [17]. Microglia are, therefore, finely tuned by the injured microenvironment that affects their shape while macrophages are characterized by their constant round-shaped morphology regardless of their tissue location.|$|R

This paper differs from others {{by comparing the}} costs of introducing multiple vaccines in a single country and then assessing the financial and economic impact {{at the time and}} implications for the future. The objective of the analysis was to understand the introduction and delivery cost per dose or per child of the three new vaccines in Rwanda to inform domestic and external financial resource mobilization. MethodsStart-up, recurrent, and capital costs from a government perspective were collected in 2012. Since pneumococcal conjugate and HPV vaccines had already been introduced, cost data for those vaccines were collected retrospectively while prospective (projected) costing was done for rotavirus vaccine. ResultsThe financial unit cost per fully immunized child (or girl for HPV vaccine) of delivering 3 doses of each vaccine (without costs related to vaccine procurement) was $ 0. 37 for rotavirus (RotaTeq®) vaccine, $ 0. 54 for pneumococcal (Prevnar®) vaccine in pre-filled syringes, and $ 10. 23 for HPV (Gardasil ®) vaccine. The financial delivery costs of Prevnar® and RotaTeq® were similar since both were delivered using existing health system infrastructure to deliver infant vaccines at health centers. The total financial cost of delivering Gardasil® was higher than those of the two infant vaccines due to greater resource requirements associated with creating a new vaccine delivery system in for a new target population of 12 -year-old girls who have not previously been served by the existing routine infant immunization program. ConclusionThe analysis indicates that service delivery strategies have an important influence on costs of introducing new vaccines and costs per girl reached with HPV vaccine are higher than the other two vaccines because of its delivery strategy. Documented <b>information</b> <b>on</b> financial <b>commitments</b> for new vaccines, particularly from government sources, is a useful input into country policy dialogue on sustainable financing and co-financing of new vaccines, as well as for policy decisions by donors such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance...|$|R
