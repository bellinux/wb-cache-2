5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>position</b> as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E

It felt like the right thing for him." [...] However, in another interview, Knight said of his exit: [...] "My five-year experience proved to me that I could not trust any answer that was given [...]" [...] Knight was [...] "at peace" [...] with his departure, saying: [...] "There just comes a time when it's so clear that moving on is the best decision." [...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know how good he has it.' There are a lot of people who would like to be <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>position.</b> But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work." ...|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the book when Cal discusses his family's history and actions prior to his birth, he speaks in an androgynous voice, with limited omniscience; he acknowledges that he is fabricating some of the details. John Mullan, University College London's professor of English and a contributor to The Guardian, wrote that by permitting Cal to be unrealistically aware of fellow characters' thoughts, Eugenides intentionally contravenes an elementary standard in storytelling fiction. In the novel's closing pages, Cal provides minute details about his father's dying moments and thoughts in a nonsensical car accident even though he is several thousand miles from the scene and only learns of the tragedy from his brother. Cal has the ability to dwell in the minds of others because as a female who has become a male, his identity is not confined by his own body. According to Mullan, this [...] "mobility of identification becomes a narrative principle" [...] and is thoroughly exploited in Middlesex. The novel follows the principle that people are molded by events prior to their birth, and Eugenides explores a character's prenatal life in terms of his or her genes; the narrator is, however, subject to the principle that whatever he does not know is of his imagination. As such, contradictory statements highlight the unreliable nature of Cal's narration. While narrating the story that pre-dates his birth, he remarks, [...] "Of course, a narrator <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>position</b> (prefetal at the time) can't be entirely sure about any of this." [...] However, he later says, [...] "I alone, from the private box of my primordial egg, saw what was going on." [...] Cal's dubious omniscience, doubtful narration, and parodies combine to show that his unreliability is an act of mischief.|$|E

[...] I had fought my way up to the top, felt secure <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>position,</b> and {{believed}} that each manufacturer would accomplish more by being untrammeled.... The name [...] "Webber", with two [...] "bs," [...] "Weber & Co." [...] "Weber Scale," [...] had appeared on a number of bogus pianos, but I did not whine about it or hire a scurilous publication... to tell the world my griefs, as they did.... I found the place where the bogus [...] "Webber" [...] instruments were made, and put a stop to the work. [...] Those of the bogus makers who proved obstinate I handed over to my attorneys... who speedily procured an injunction on the work and recovered judgement.

2500|$|In {{terms of}} musical activity—or lack thereof—Bellini {{pleaded guilty in}} the letter to Florimo in March 1844: [...] "If you reflect {{for a moment that}} a young man <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>position,</b> in London and Paris for the first time, cannot help amusing himself immensely, you will excuse me." [...] However, in January 1834, he had signed a {{contract}} to write a new opera for the Théâtre-Italien which would be presented {{at the end of the}} year. [...] At the same time, he had been invited to write a new opera for the San Carlo in Naples for the 1834–35 Carnival season, but declined given the Paris commitment and stated that it might be possible to do so by May 1835 when he knew who were to be the contracted singers. Florimo immediately began to try to persuade his friend to take up this offer, indicating that Malibran had been engaged for Naples in January 1835.|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} the attacks by Madero and his earlier {{statements}} to the contrary, Díaz ran for re-election. In a show of U.S. support, Díaz and William Howard Taft planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, for 16 October 1909, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president and also {{the first time a}} U.S. president would cross the border into Mexico. At the meeting, Diaz told John Hays Hammond, [...] "Since I am responsible for bringing several billion dollars in foreign investments into my country, I think I should continue <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>position</b> until a competent successor is found." [...] The summit was a great success for Díaz, {{but it could have been}} a major tragedy. On the day of the summit, Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol along the procession route and they disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Díaz and Taft.|$|E
2500|$|Holt {{enlisted in}} the Militia in February 1939, joining a {{part-time}} artillery unit for businessmen and professionals. He was given indefinite leave during his ministerial service. In May 1940, without resigning his seat, Holt {{enlisted in the}} Australian Imperial Force {{with the intent of}} becoming a full-time soldier. He was posted to the 2/4th Field Regiment, holding the rank of gunner. He had been offered a commission as an officer in the Royal Australian Air Force, but declined due to his lack of experience. In a press statement, Holt said [...] "as the youngest member of the House, I could not feel happy <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>position</b> if I were not prepared to make some sacrifice and take an active part". He was sent to Puckapunyal for training, and expected to be posted to North Africa or Palestine. Two of his parliamentary colleagues, William Hutchinson and Keith Wilson, enlisted around the same time, while Thomas White had already done so. In total, nine sitting MPs served in the military at some point in World War II.|$|E
2500|$|The {{document}} {{sent to the}} President of the Republic goes on {{to repeat}} SEAM's commitment {{to the terms of}} the 2004 Interinstitutional Cooperation Agreement with the ultimate goal of maintaining a forest reserve and transferring title to the indigenous inhabitants of the property in observance with the National Constitution and aforementioned laws N° 352/94, N° 904/94, N° 234/93. [...] Continuing, the document states that [...] ".. taking into account that the aforementioned property functions as permanent location of the native Aché community Kuetuvy, and according to the principles of national law 234/93, which endorses article 14 of ILO Convention 169 (this refers to the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 formulated by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, United Nations) stating that [...] "The rights of ownership and possession of the peoples concerned over the lands which they traditionally occupy shall be recognised.", <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>position</b> as Secretary of the Environment I am submitting the background concerning this case to the Presidencia de la República, in order that the corresponding necessary steps be taken by the appropriate entities, in order that we comply with the first clause in the framework of the mentioned International Convention." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kevin Harvick {{dominated}} {{the race to}} score the victory. [...] "Wow. I guess that's {{what it feels like}} to hit a walkoff in extra innings. I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. I could tell that we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we get to go on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had to get to this next round. That little boy has got a lot of things coming in this sport and he used me up like that in a truck at Eldora a couple years ago. From my standpoint, I call it even but I think if he was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>position,</b> he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there were a lot of cars racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. It's a little upsetting he pushed me up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) can't fault him for being aggressive there. I think a lot of drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|E
