5|$|Orthogenesis was the {{hypothesis}} that life has an innate tendency to change, in a unilinear fashion, towards ever-greater perfection. It had a significant following in the 19th century, and <b>its</b> <b>proponents</b> included the Russian biologist Leo S. Berg and the American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn. Orthogenesis was popular among some paleontologists, who believed that the fossil record showed a gradual and constant unidirectional change.|$|E
5|$|The Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) was {{particularly}} vocal about increased African {{representation in the}} Nyasaland Legislative Council, demanding in September 1957 an African majority in the council. Nyasaland's inclusion in the federation was never a goal of <b>its</b> <b>proponents,</b> it was there primarily {{because it was not}} economically viable by itself. Welensky did not understand or appreciate the party's goal of increased African representation or secession when it relied on the federation for its well being.|$|E

5|$|The Illinois Board of State Park Advisers was {{established}} under a 1925 state law. The law, which was amended in 1931, gave {{the director of}} the Illinois Department of Public Works jurisdiction over the state parks. The Public Works position was a result of 1917 reforms by Governor Frank Lowden. The law also mandated a system of state parks, under the Illinois Department of Conservation, later renamed the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Per the 1925 mandate, White Pines Forest became a state park in 1927 after <b>its</b> <b>proponents</b> enlisted the support of the Chicago Tribune and WGN Radio. That year, Governor Len Small moved to purchase White Pines for $63,949.|$|E
5|$|In 1928 China adopted GR as the nation's {{official}} romanization system. GR {{was used}} to indicate pronunciations in dictionaries of the National (Mandarin-based) Language. <b>Its</b> <b>proponents</b> hoped one day to establish it as a writing system for a reformed Chinese script. But despite support from {{a small number of}} trained linguists in China and overseas, GR met with public indifference and even hostility due to its complexity. Another obstacle preventing its widespread adoption was its narrow basis on the Beijing dialect, in a period lacking a strong centralized government to enforce its use. Eventually GR lost ground to Pinyin and other later romanization systems. However, its influence is still evident, as several of the principles introduced by its creators have been used in romanization systems that followed it. Its pattern of tone spelling was retained in the standard spelling of the Chinese province of Shaanxi (shǎnxī, 陝西), which cannot be distinguished from Shanxi (shānxī, 山西) when written in pinyin without diacritics.|$|E
5|$|In World War II, {{the bomber}} mafia's {{theory of the}} primacy of unescorted {{daylight}} strategic bombing was proved wrong. Fleets of heavy bombers {{were not able to}} achieve victory without the cooperation of the Army and Navy, and required the protection of long-range fighters for deep penetration missions. Overall casualties in the war were not minimal, and victory did not come significantly quicker. Precision in bombing was not achieved until long-range fighter escorts became available and air superiority was achieved, as opponents had warned. The strategic bombing concept, however, was {{a major factor in the}} eventual victory and became the first core doctrine of the independent United States Air Force. <b>Its</b> <b>proponents</b> continued to promote the doctrine into the nuclear age, forming the Strategic Air Command to carry out a vision modified to fit the needs of the Cold War and the threat of nuclear warfare. The bomber mafia was gradually replaced in the 1950s and 1960s by advocates of intercontinental ballistic missile warfare.|$|E

5|$|In {{a review}} article, J. David Archibald and David E. Fastovsky {{discussed}} a scenario combining three major postulated causes: volcanism, marine regression, and extraterrestrial impact. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in, and loss of, habitats. Dinosaurs, {{as the largest}} vertebrates, were the first affected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, particulate materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then, an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains, both in the already-stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains. The major difference between this hypothesis and the single-cause hypotheses is that <b>its</b> <b>proponents</b> view the suggested single causes as, either not sufficient in strength to cause the extinctions or, not likely to produce the taxonomic pattern of the extinction. Recent work at Seymour Island, Antarctica showed two separate extinction events near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, with one correlating to Deccan Trap volcanism and one correlated with the Chicxulub impact.|$|E
5|$|Since {{its initial}} {{resolution}} of July 1960, the UN had issued further resolutions {{calling for the}} total withdrawal of Belgian and mercenary forces from Katanga in progressively stronger terms. By 1961, ONUC comprised nearly 20,000 men. Although their mandate prevented them from taking sides, ONUC had a mandate to arrest foreign mercenaries wherever they encountered them. In September 1961, an attempt to detain a group of Katangese mercenaries without violence during Operation Morthor went wrong {{and turned into a}} fire-fight. ONUC's claim to impartiality was undermined in mid-September when a company of Irish UN troops were captured by numerically superior Katangese forces following a six-day siege in Jadotville. Katanga proceeded to hold the Irishmen as prisoners of war, a development that deeply embarrassed the UN mission and <b>its</b> <b>proponents.</b>|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the emergentist {{coalition}} model argue that, as a hybrid, {{this model}} moves towards a more holistic explanation of word learning {{that is not}} captured by models with a singular focus. For instance, constraints theories typically argue that constraints/principles are available to children from the onset of word learning, but do not explain how children develop into expert speakers who are not limited by constraints. Additionally, some argue that domain-general perspectives do not fully {{address the question of}} how children sort through numerous potential referents in order to correctly sort out meaning. Lastly, social pragmatic theories claim that social encounters guide word learning. Although these theories describe how children become more advanced word learners, they seem to tell us little about children's capacities at the start of word learning. According to <b>its</b> <b>proponents,</b> the emergentist coalion model incorporates constraints/principles, but argues for the development and change in these principles over time, while simultaneously taking into consideration social aspects of word learning alongside other cues, such as salience.|$|E

5|$|The book aroused {{international}} interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much {{of the initial}} reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory, but Darwin {{had to be taken}} seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. <b>Its</b> <b>proponents</b> made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant.|$|E

Other scholars disagree with this assertion of direct divinity, particularly the Druze themselves, noting that <b>its</b> <b>proponent</b> was ad-Darazi, who (according to some resources) al-Ḥākim executed for shirk. Letters show that ad-Darazi was trying to gain control of the Muwahhidun movement and this claim was an attempt to gain support from the Caliph, who instead found it heretical.|$|R
