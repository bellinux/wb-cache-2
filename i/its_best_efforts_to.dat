They found the necessity for recourse to the imaginary pawnbroker growing upon them with alarming rapidity; and though the few small articles that they sent out for that purpose never really went beyond kind Mrs. Halliss's kitchen dresser, yet so far as Ernest and Edie were concerned, the effect was {{much the same as}} if they had been really pledged to the licensed broker. The good woman hid them away carefully in the back drawers of the dresser, sending up as much money for the poor little trinkets as she thought it at all credible that any man in his senses could possibly advance--if she had given altogether too much, she thought it probable that even the unsuspicious Le Bretons would detect the kindly deception--at the time remarking to John that 'if ever them pore dear young creechurs was able to redeem 'em again, why, well an' good; an' if not, why, they could just find some excuse to give 'em back to the dear lady after pore Mr. Le Breting was dead an' gone, as he must be, no doubt, afore many months was over.' What wretched stuff that is that some narrow-minded cynics love to talk, after their cheap moralising fashion, about the coldness and cruelty of the world! The world is not cold and cruel; it is brimming over everywhere with kindliness and warmth of heart; and you have only got to put yourself into the proper circumstances in order to call forth at once on every hand, and in all classes, its tenderest and truest sympathies. None but selfish, unsympathetic people themselves ever find it otherwise in the day of trouble. It is not the world that is cold and heartless--it is not the individual members of the world that are cruel and unkind--it is the relentless march of circumstances--the faulty organisation which none of us can control, and for which none of us is personally responsible, that grinds us to powder under its Juggernaut wheels.

40|$|Multimedia {{applications}} {{have been}} the key driving force in converging fixed, mobile and IP networks. A major hurdle in the realisation of this convergence is obtaining Quality of Service from a heterogeneous, best-effort service network. Interactive voice requires strict bounds on delay, jitter and packet losses, for Different Network Traffic Intensity, whereas video adds significant bandwidth requirements to the network, while Internet only makes <b>its</b> <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> deliver a packet. Hence, the end-to-end QoS management of heterogeneous networks supporting multimedia services is of paramount importance. We present an empirical performance study of multimedia applications over 802. 11 networks within metropolitan area networking environments. Specifically, we study the QoS performance of Voice over IP (VoIP) applications over 802. 11 -based networks, while sharing the network resources with HTTP and video applications. Using the OPNET simulator, we simulate several realistic application traffic scenarios, and we investigate the performance of VoIP applications by analyzing QoS parameters, such as delay, jitter, MOS, and packet loss ratio. Subsequently, the performance characteristics data of the network, which we obtain through simulations, are used to build a Markov model of the network performance to extend our analysis and gain further insight into the network performance dynamics...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the most recent}} progress {{and implementation of the}} NILDE (Network Inter-Library Document Exchange) system, which was developed by the National Research Council (CNR) Bologna Research Area Library. NILDE is a web based document delivery (DD) software for libraries and end-users. It allows libraries to manage the entire workflow of DD activities, both borrowing and lending, through the provision of synthetic and analytical statistics, DD performance indicators "fill-rate" and "turn-around time", and support for secure electronic delivery. As new challenges in electronic publishing (such as increases in the price of journals, cross-access and licensing issues) have led libraries {{from all over the world}} to organize in consortia, the rise in NILDE users has allowed the building of a cooperation network to promote resource sharing based on a degree of standard quality of service and fair behaviour, and to establish an efficient communication channel among libraries, consortia and publishers. It has been proved that, in order to accomplish effective resource sharing, libraries should be willing to fulfil document delivery on a reciprocal basis, both requesting and providing documents. In particular, each library should make <b>its</b> <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> expose and update its holdings by actively participating in collective national OPACs or in Italian meta-OPACs. It has been shown how, by adhering to these principles, libraries start up a virtuous cycle within the NILDE network, increasing its own value. As a result, the growth rate of numbers of NILDE libraries has accelerated, showing that the above said resource sharing policy is a real building block for success. In order to guarantee scalability and high performance operations, the overall system architecture has been rethought, ending up in the design of a brand new piece of software. New technologies, referred to as Web 2. 0, have been incorporated into NILDE, making it an even more user-oriented and friendly tool for document delivery and scholar work...|$|R

40|$|One {{striking}} development {{associated with}} the explosion of e-commerce is the increased transparency of sellers' quality history. In this paper we analyze how this affects firms' incentives to invest in quality when the outcome of investment is uncertain. We identify two conflicting effects. On the one hand, reducing the consumer's cost of search for quality exacerbates {{the negative effects of}} past poor performance. This increases incentives to invest, leading to higher quality. On the other hand, the fact that a firm, despite <b>its</b> <b>best</b> <b>efforts,</b> may fail <b>to</b> live up to consumers' more demanding expectations, makes investment less attractive. This discourages investment, leading to lower quality. We show that reducing the search cost leads to higher quality if the initial level of the search cost is sufficiently high but may lead to lower quality if the initial level of the search cost is sufficiently low. search, internet search, quality, risky investment...|$|R
5000|$|Imago therapy {{focuses on}} collaboratively healing {{childhood}} wounds couples share. According to Hendrix and Hunt, {{the human brain}} has a compelling non-negotiable drive to restore feelings of aliveness and wholeness with which people came into the world. It is believed by imago therapists that a person's brain constructs an image of characteristics from their primary caretakers including both their best and worst traits. The brain's unconscious drive is to repair damage done in childhood, needs not met, by finding a partner who can give us what our caretakers failed to provide. [...] This is why traits of a future partner often reflect our parents' traits. Our unconscious drives towards this to seek healing and to resolve unresolved childhood wounds, in order to grow. In this way, wounds received by a person, from their parents, tend to be re-stimulated by new adult partners and potential partners. The re-stimulation triggers old, unresolved emotions. Both people in the relationship {{can learn how to}} heal one another, and appreciate each other for the person they are--and--it takes time. Couples must engage in a specific type of dialogue for Imago therapy to work. The conscious self {{may not be able to}} see and understand clearly the reflection of unresolved parental issues in his or her current marriage partner. Nonetheless, our unconscious connects with this person in <b>its</b> <b>best</b> (unconscious) <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> heal old wounds and allow love into your life again.|$|R
