50|$|In June 2009, Oregon {{established}} a pilot solar volumetric <b>incentive</b> <b>rate</b> and payment program. Under this incentive program, systems {{are paid for}} the kilowatt-hours (kWh) generated over a 15-year period, at a rate set {{at the time a}} system is enrolled in the program. The Oregon Public Utility Commission (PUC) established rates and rules in May 2010. This program was offered by the three investor-owned utilities in Oregon and administered by the utilities. The PUC planned to periodically re-evaluate rates. Program costs were recoverable in utility rates and utility-owned systems were not eligible for the incentive.|$|E
50|$|Systems sized 100 kW or less could {{participate}} {{based on}} net metering. Generating capacity of 20 MW of the aggregate cap {{was reserved for}} the net metering portion, with 12 MW available for residential and 8 MW available for small commercial systems. These residential and small commercial systems were paid {{for the amount of}} electricity generated, up to the amount of electricity consumed. In essence, customers were paid for the amount of utility electric load consumption that is offset by onsite generation. Unlike typical feed-in tariffs, customers can consume the electricity generated on-site and receive a production incentive - or a volumetric incentive payment - for the amount of electricity generated and consumed. To remove a perverse incentive to increase electricity consumption to receive a greater payment, the system had to be appropriately sized to meet average electricity consumption. Rates were determined by the PUC based on annual system cost and annual energy output, differentiated by geographic zones. The cost estimates were based on installation data from Energy Trust of Oregon. The actual rates paid to the customer-generator were the volumetric <b>incentive</b> <b>rate</b> minus the retail rate. The volumetric incentive rates were to be re-evaluated every six months. The rates for the performance-based incentive program ranged from $0.25/kWh to $0.411/kWh.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop an optimal incentive system for multitasking scientists in universities or professors under repeat contracting. With the aid of a principal agent model under repeat contracting, we show that (i) when a second task is assigned to a professor and the two tasks are related, the size of the optimal <b>incentive</b> <b>rate</b> for the first task is reduced in some situations but not others relative to that of a single task, (ii) with an increase in the noise in the technical relationship of the second task or imprecision in output measurement, the optimal <b>incentive</b> <b>rate</b> for that task is reduced and for the first task may be reduced or increased, (iii) with greater efficiency of the professor in producing the second output, as reflected in ability relative to cost of effort, the optimal <b>incentive</b> <b>rate</b> for the first task generally decreases, (iv) if the output of the professor 2 ̆ 7 s two tasks are negatively correlated then the optimal <b>incentive</b> <b>rate</b> on the first task declines as the size of this correlation increases. The size of the guarantee is always reduced as the professor 2 ̆ 7 s ability for a task increases, but is increased as his cost of effort, noisiness of the technology or measurement of output, or correlation between the two outputs increases. It is also possible that, as a professor undertakes several difficult-to-measure tasks, the <b>incentive</b> <b>rate</b> will be reduced to the point that an optimal compensation system will involve only a guaranteed salary, which is a very weak incentive for effort.

40|$|Classical agency models assume strict {{opportunistic}} {{behavior of}} all actors and neglect intrinsic motivation. In a multi-task LEN setting, we consider an agent who bears ethical costs {{if he does}} not meet a given effort-standard set by the principal. We determine optimal linear incentive contracts and derive comparative static results for varying degrees of ethical behavior. Intuition suggests that more ethical behavior results in higher effort, reduces the necessity for offering extrinsic incentives, and results in higher returns to the principal. However, these predictions hold, in general, only if the agent is very ethical. Our results show that the relation between work ethic, effort, and <b>incentive</b> <b>rates</b> is non-monotonic, i. e., intrinsic motivation may substitute for, or complement, extrinsic rewards. For example, we identify conditions under which <b>incentive</b> <b>rates</b> increase with an agent’s work ethic.

30|$|First, let us {{assume that}} only the {{accounting}} measures are available (no P_ 2), but that late reporting does not restrict the availability for contracting. In our two-period setting, this would imply y_ 2 ^L {{could be used for}} contracting once it is reported in period three. To be consistent, under limited commitment an <b>incentive</b> <b>rate</b> on y_ 2 ^L would be chosen sequentially optimal at t = 2. With full commitment, obviously the late system dominates the early one as more precise contracting information can be used to control both efforts. No trade-off is present any more. With limited commitment, however, it will be impossible to motivate any effort at all. To see that, note that a_ 2 has already been performed in period two. As the agent is risk averse it is optimal for the principal to put zero weight on a performance measure y_ 2 ^L at t = 2 if it is not completely noiseless. With respect to the first-period effort the same rationale applies. Recall that the <b>incentive</b> <b>rate</b> on y_ 1 ^L was chosen to optimally hedge compensation risk related to the use of P_ 2. In the absence of such a measure it is ex post optimal to set s = 0 such that no effort is motivated at all. To sum up, late reporting dominates early reporting with full commitment, and early reporting dominates late reporting with limited commitment. This result, again, holds if the timing of reporting is irrelevant for contractability and no performance measures besides accounting measures can be used. We found both assumptions not very convincing and thus decided against them.|$|E
