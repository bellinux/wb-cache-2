40|$|Constitutive {{activation}} of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -signaling axis is frequently observed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Especially the overexpression of the fetal growth factor IGF-II, IGF-Ireceptor (IGF-IR), and cytoplasmic downstream effectors such as insulin-receptor substrates (IRS) contribute to proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and invasive behavior. This review focuses on the relevant alterations in this signaling pathway and independent in vivo models that support the central role IGF-II signaling during <b>HCC</b> <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>progression.</b> Since this pathway has become the center of interest as a target for potential anti-cancer therapy in many types of malignancies, various experimental strategies have been developed, including neutralizing antibodies and selective receptor kinase inhibitors, {{with respect to the}} specific and efficient reduction of oncogenic IGF-II/IGF-IR-signaling...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{the fifth}} most prevalent cancer {{and is one of}} the leading causes of cancer-related death. The risk factors for HCC include cirrhosis, chronic viral hepatitis, heavy alcohol intake and metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance is a common denominator of all of these conditions and is tethered to hyperinsulinaemia. Here, we give an overview of the recent advances linking hyperinsulinaemia to <b>HCC</b> <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>progression.</b> In particular, we summarise the underlying causes of hyperinsulinaemia in the setting of chronic liver diseases.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Understanding the {{molecular}} pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) {{is essential to}} identify therapeutic targets. A hepatitis B virus (HBV) related double transgenic murine model was developed. METHODS: Liver specific expression of HBV X protein (HBx) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS 1) was achieved and transgenic mice were followed from birth to age 21 months. Liver and tumor tissue were assessed for histologic changes as well as activation of signal transduction pathways by qRT-PCR and multiplex ELISA protein assays. RESULTS: Overexpression of HBx and IRS 1 stimulates liver cell proliferation in the double transgenic mice. Only the male mice developed HCC starting at age 15 - 18 months. The IN/IGF 1 /IRS 1 /MAPK/ERK and IN/IGF 1 /IRS 1 /PI 3 K/AKT/GSK 3 ß cascades were activated early (6 - 9 months) in the liver followed by WNT/ß-catenin and Notch signaling. Aspartate ß-hydroxylase (ASPH) was found to link these upstream growth factor signaling pathways to downstream Notch activation in tumor tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained overexpression of HBx and IRS 1 led to constitutive activation of a tripartite growth factor signal transduction cascade in the liver and was necessary and sufficient to promote <b>HCC</b> <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>progression...</b>|$|E

This study aims to evaluate immunohistochemical expression of the AMACR in neoplastic and nonneoplastic liver lesions, and assess its value in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 51 HCC (14 well, 22 moderately and 15 poorly differentiated), 9 hepatocellular adenoma (HCA), 48 cirrhotic nodules (CN) and 16 normal liver tissues (NLT) were immunostained for AMACR. Results Expression of AMACR is significantly enhanced in HCC tissue compared with non-HCC tissue. High expression of AMACR was found in 82 % of HCC including 86 % of well-differentiated HCC. In contrast, only 11 % of HCA, 13 % of CN and 6 % of NLT showed high expression for AMACR. Clinicopathological evaluation showed a significant correlation between AMACR expression and venous invasion and capsular invasion by HCC. Conclusion Our results suggest that AMACR staining may serve as a useful marker for the differential diagnosis of well-differentiated HCC from HCA.

40|$|Despite the {{increasingly}} {{important role of}} Hippo-Yap in hepatocellular carcinoma (<b>HCC)</b> <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>progression,</b> little insight {{is available at the}} time regarding the specifics interaction of Yap and cancer cells migration. Here, we identified the mechanism by which tumor-intrinsic Yap deletion resulted in HCC migratory inhibition. Yap was greatly upregulated in HCC and its expression promoted the cells migration. Functional studies found that knockdown of Yap induced JNK phosphorylation which closely bound to the Bnip 3 promoter and contributed to Bnip 3 expression. Higher Bnip 3 employed excessive mitophagy leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP shortage. The insufficient ATP inactivated SERCA and consequently triggered intracellular calcium overload. As the consequence of calcium oscillation, Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II (CaMKII) was signaled and subsequently inhibited cofilin activity via phosphorylated modification. The phosphorylated cofilin failed to manipulate F-actin polymerization and lamellipodium formation, resulting into the impairment of lamellipodium-based migration. Collectively, our results identified Hippo-Yap as the tumor promoter in hepatocellular carcinoma that mediated via activation of cofilin/F-actin/lamellipodium axis by limiting JNK-Bnip 3 -SERCA-CaMKII pathways, with potential application to HCC therapy involving cancer metastasis.

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{the fifth}} most common cancer worldwide, accounting for an estimated 600, 000 deaths annually. Aberrant methylation, consisting of DNA hypomethylation and/or promoter gene CpG hypermethylation, is implicated {{in the development of}} a variety of solid tumors, including HCC. We analyzed the global levels of DNA methylation as well as the methylation status of 105 putative tumor suppressor genes and found that the extent of genome-wide hypomethylation and CpG hypermethylation correlates with biological features and clinical outcome of HCC patients. We identified activation of Ras and downstream Ras effectors (ERK, AKT, and RAL) due to epigenetic silencing of inhibitors of the Ras pathway in all HCC. Further, selective inactivation of SPRY 1 and - 2, DAB 2, and SOCS 4 and - 5 genes and inhibitors of angiogenesis (BNIP 3, BNIP 3 L, IGFBP 3, and EGLN 2) was associated with poor prognosis. Importantly, several epigenetically silenced putative tumor suppressor genes found in HCC were also inactivated in the nontumorous liver.

40|$|The {{onset of}} {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma (HCC) {{is related to}} the development of non-neoplastic liver disease, such as viral infections and cirrhosis.

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{the third}} leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Due to {{the high incidence of}} post-operative recurrence after current treatments, the identification of new and more effective drugs is required. In previous years, new targetable genes/pathways involved in HCC pathogenesis have been discovered through the help of high-throughput sequencing technologies. Mutations in TP 53 and β-catenin genes are the most frequent aberrations in HCC. However, approaches able to reverse the effect of these mutations might be unpredictable. In fact, if the reactivation of proteins, such as p 53 in tumours, holds great promise as anticancer therapy, there are studies arguing that chronic activation of these types of molecules may be deleterious. Thus, recently the efforts on potential targets have focused on actionable mutations, such as those occurring in the gene encoding for focal adhesion kinase (FAK). This tyrosine kinase, localized to cellular focal contacts, is over-expressed in a variety of human tumours, including HCC. Moreover, several lines of evidence demonstrated that FAK depletion or inhibition impair in vitro and in vivo HCC growth and metastasis.

In this study, we hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HULC and MALAT 1 may contribute to HCC risk. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study and genotyped two SNPs, rs 7763881 in HULC and rs 619586 in MALAT 1, in 1300 HBV positive HCC patients, 1344 HBV persistent carriers and 1344 subjects with HBV natural clearance to test the associations between the two SNPs and susceptibility to HCC and HBV chronic infection. RESULTS: The variant genotypes of rs 7763881 were significantly associated with decreased HCC risk in a dominant genetic model [AC/CC vs. AA: adjusted odds ration (OR)  =  0. 81, 95 % confidence intervals (CIs)  =  0. 68 - 0. 97, P  =  0. 022].

Understanding of the molecular mechanism of <b>HCC</b> <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>progression</b> is imperative for developing novel, effective, and targeted therapies for this lethal disease. In this article, we document that the cellular transcription factor Late SV 40 Factor (LSF) {{plays an important role}} in HCC pathogenesis. LSF protein was significantly overexpressed in human HCC cells compared to normal hepatocytes. In 109 HCC patients, LSF protein was overexpressed in > 90 % cases, compared to normal liver, and LSF expression level showed significant correlation with the stages and grades of the disease. Forced overexpression of LSF in less aggressive HCC cells resulted in highly aggressive, angiogenic, and multiorgan metastatic tumors in nude mice. Conversely, inhibition of LSF significantly abrogated growth and metastasis of highly aggressive HCC cells in nude mice. Microarray studies revealed that as a transcription factor, LSF modulated specific genes regulating invasion, angiogenesis, chemoresistance, and senescence. The expression of osteopontin (OPN), a gene regulating every step in tumor progression and metastasis, was robustly up-regulated by LSF. It was documented that LSF transcriptionally up-regulates OPN, and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that OPN {{plays an important role in}} mediating the oncogenic functions of LSF.

We investigated the correlation between GI and DNA methylation, and influence of methionine metabolism deregulation on these parameters and hepatocarcinogenesis in c-Myc and c-Myc/Tgf-α transgenic mice and human HCCs. S -adenosyl-L-methionine/ S -adenosylhomocysteine ratio and liver-specific methionine adenosyltransferase (MatI/III) progressively decreased in dysplastic and neoplastic liver lesions developed in c-Myc transgenic mice and in human HCC with better (HCCB) and poorer (HCCP) prognosis (based on patient's survival length). Deregulation of these parameters resulted in a rise of global DNA hypomethylation both in c-Myc and human liver lesions, positively correlated with GI levels in mice and humans, and inversely correlated with the length of survival of HCC patients. No changes in MATI/III and DNA methylation occurred in c-Myc/Tgf-α lesions and in a small human HCC subgroup with intermediate prognosis, where a proliferative activity {{similar to that of}} c-Myc HCC and HCCB was associated with low apoptosis. Upregulation of genes involved in polyamine synthesis, methionine salvage and downregulation of polyamine negative regulator OAZ 1, was highest in c-Myc/Tgf-α HCCs and HCCP.

HepG 2 cells were treated with GABA at serial concentrations (0, 1, 10, 20, 40 and 60 &#x 3 BC;mol/L), and their proliferating abilities were analyzed with the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay, cell cycle analysis and tumor implanted in nude mice. Small interfering RNA was used for knocking down the endogenous GABRQ in HepG 2. Proliferating abilities of these cells treated with or without GABA were analyzed. RESULTS: We identified the overexpression of GABRQ in HCC cell lines {{and half of the}} tested HCC tissues. Knockdown of endogenous GABRQ expression in HepG 2 attenuated HCC cell growth, suggesting its role in HCC cell viability. We studied the effect of GABA in the proliferation of GABRQ-positive cell lines in vitro and in vivo, and found that GABA increased HCC growth in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, the addition of GABA into the cell culture medium promoted the proliferation of GABRQ-expressing HepG 2 cells, but not GABRQ-knockdown HepG 2 cells, which means that GABA stimulates HepG 2 cell growth through GABRQ.

The role of BMPs in liver damage responses including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development has only begun to be addressed and strong evidence supports the concept of a pro-tumorigenic role of BMP signaling in HCC cells. BMP- 9 (also termed Growth and Differentiation Factor (GDF) - 2) represents the most recently discovered member of the BMP family. We have previously demonstrated that in HCC patient samples BMP- 9 expression was positively associated with the tumor seize (“T stage”) and that it enhanced cell migration and induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC cells in vitro. In another study we recently found that BMP- 9 promotes growth in HCC cells, but not in non-transformed hepatocytes. Published as well as unpublished results obtained with primary hepatocytes support the concept of a dual function of BMP- 9 in the liver: while in primary, non-malignant cells BMP- 9 stabilizes the epithelial phenotype and inhibits proliferation, in HCC cells it induces cell growth and the acquisition of a migratory phenotype. In this review article we summarize current knowledge about BMPs in liver diseases, with special focus on the role of BMP- 9 in <b>HCC</b> <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>progression,</b> that may provide new clues for a better understanding of the contribution of BMP-signaling to chronic liver diseases...|$|E

They have been identified in various tumor types, demonstrating that different sets of miRNAs are usually deregulated in different cancers. To identify the miRNA signatures specific for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) -associated Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), miRNA expression profiling of 32 HCC post-HCV infected, 74 HCV-positive and 12 control individuals was carried out using whole genome expression profiling. Differential expression of two individual miRNAs between control and high risk HCV patients was detected and found to possibly target genes related to <b>HCC</b> <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>progression.</b> The sensitivity and specificity of miR- 618 for detecting HCC among HCV-positive individuals was found to be 64 % and 68 %, respectively.

These predictive values are greatly improved compared to the traditional &# 945;-feto protein (AFP) level-based detection method. The proposed HCC miRNA signatures may therefore be of great value for the early diagnosis of HCC, before the onset of disease in HCV-positive patients.

Epidemiology data show that men have a much higher incidence of HCC than women, suggesting that estrogens and its receptors may inhibit <b>HCC</b> <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>progression.</b> Whether estrogens antagonize oncogenic action of leptin is uncertain. To investigate potential inhibitory effects of estrogens on leptin-induced HCC development, HCC cell line HepG 2 cells were treated with leptin in combination with 17 β-estradiol (E 2), estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) selective agonist PPT, ER-β selective agonist DPN, or G protein-coupled ER (GPER) selective agonist G- 1. Cell number, proliferation, and apoptosis were determined, and leptin- and estrogen-related intracellular signaling pathways were analyzed. HepG 2 cells expressed {{a low level of}} ER-β mRNA, and leptin treatment increased ER-β expression. E 2 suppressed leptin-induced HepG 2 cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally E 2 reversed leptin-induced STAT 3 and leptin-suppressed SOCS 3, which was mainly achieved by activation of ER-β. E 2 also enhanced ERK via activating ER-α and GPER and activated p 38 /MAPK via activating ER-β. To conclude, E 2 and its receptors antagonize the oncogenic actions of leptin in HepG 2 cells by inhibiting cell proliferation and stimulating cell apoptosis, which was associated with reversing leptin-induced changes in SOCS 3 /STAT 3 and increasing p 38 /MAPK by activating ER-β, and increasing ERK by activating ER-α and GPER.

Microarray analysis was performed, and it has been evaluated the gene expression profiles of liver lesions developed in PIK 3 CA-E 545 K mice in order to identify PI 3 KCA gene targets and signal transduction pathways involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (<b>HCC)</b> <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>progression.</b> Results: Overexpression of PIK 3 CA-E 545 K resulted in the development of multiple liver tumors in 129 /Sv-C 57 BL/ 6 mice after 6 months of latency. cDNA microarray technology showed the overexpression of a group of genes involved in lipid metabolism, cell proliferation and survival in the lesions of PIK 3 CA-E 545 mice when compared with control mice. Conclusions: The present results indicate that oncogenic forms of PIK 3 CA are sufficient to induce malignant tansformation of the mouse liver. We have also identified a number of PIK 3 CA targets, whose investigation might be helpful both for a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HCC and the development of new therapeutic strategies against this deadly disease. </br...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the expression pattern of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and indicate {{the relationship among}} gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor α 3 subunit (GABRA 3) and HCC. METHODS: HCC cell line Chang, HepG 2, normal liver cell line L- 02 and 8 samples of HCC tissues and paired non-cancerous tissues were analyzed with semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{for the expression of}} GABAA receptors. HepG 2 cells were treated with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at serial concentrations (0, 1, 10, 20, 40 and 60 μmol/L), and their proliferating abilities were analyzed with the 3 -(4, 5 -methylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, cell doubling time test, colon formation assay, cell cycle analysis and tumor planted in nude mice. Small interfering RNA was used for knocking down the endogenous GABRA 3 in HepG 2. Proliferating abilities of these cells treated with or without GABA were analyzed. RESULTS: We identified the overexpression of GABRA 3 in HCC cells. Knockdown of endogenous GABRA 3 expression in HepG 2 attenuated HCC cell growth, suggesting its role in HCC cell viability. We determined the in vitro and in vivo effect of GABA in the proliferation of GABRA 3 -positive cell lines, and found that GABA increased HCC growth in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, the addition of GABA into the cell culture medium promoted the proliferation of GABRA 3 -expressing HepG 2 cells, but not GABRA 3 -knockdown HepG 2 cells. This means that GABA stimulates HepG 2 cell growth through GABRA 3. CONCLUSION: GABA and GABRA 3 play important roles in <b>HCC</b> <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>progression</b> and can be a promising molecular target for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for HCC...|$|E
