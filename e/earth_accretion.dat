40|$|The {{concept of}} Late Veneer has been {{introduced}} by the geochemical community to explain the abundance of highly siderophile elements in the Earth's mantle and their chondritic proportions relative to each other. However, in the complex scenario of <b>Earth</b> <b>accretion,</b> involving both planetesimal bombardment and giant impacts from chondritic and differentiated projectiles, it is not obvious what the "Late Veneer" actually corresponds to. In fact, the process of differentiation of the Earth was probably intermittent and there was presumably no well-defined transition between an earlier phase where all metal sunk into the core and a later phase in which the core was a closed entity separated from the mantle.

Here we show that lead partitioning into liquid iron depends strongly on carbon content and that, given a content of approximately 0. 2 % carbon, experimental and isotopic data both provide evidence of strong partitioning of lead into the core throughout the <b>Earth's</b> <b>accretion.</b> Earlier conclusions that lead is weakly partitioned into iron arose from the use of carbon-saturated (about 5 % C) iron alloys.

50|$|The {{process by}} which cratons were formed from early rock is called cratonization. The first large cratonic landmasses formed during the Archean eon.

This resulted in rapid formation of oceanic crust at ridges and hot spots, and rapid recycling of oceanic crust at subduction zones. There are at least three hypotheses of how cratons have been formed: 1) surface crust was thickened by a rising plume of deep molten material, 2) successive subducting plates of oceanic lithosphere became lodged beneath a proto-craton in an under-plating process, 3) accretion from island arcs or continental fragments rafting together to thicken into a craton.|$|R

First, volatiles were driven out of the interior of the earth during the course of <b>earth</b> <b>accretion</b> or very shortly thereafter. This early degassing was a consequence of rapid accretion, which gave the young earth a hot and rapidly convecting interior. Second, the early earth lacked extensive, stable continental platforms on which carbon could be stored in the form of carbonate minerals for geologically significant periods of time. In the absence of continental platforms on the early earth, the earth's carbon must have been either in the atmosphere or ocean or in the form of shortlived sedimentary deposits on ephemeral sea floor...|$|E
40|$|If {{the earth}} were molten during its later stages of {{accretion}} {{as indicated by}} the present understanding of planetary accretion process, the differentiation that {{led to the formation of}} the core and mantle must have occurred at high temperatures in the range of 3000 - 5000 K because of the effect of pressure on the temperature of melting in the interior of the earth. This calls into question the use of low-temperature laboratory measurements of partition coefficients of trace elements to make inferences about <b>earth</b> <b>accretion</b> and differentiation. The low temperature partition coefficients cannot be directly applied to high temperature fractionations because partition coefficients refer to an equilibrium specific to a temperature for a given reaction, and must change in some proportion to exp 1 /RT.

Polished surfaces of the rock and planetary dust-forming silicate mineral olivine ((Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4) show significant surface reorganization textures upon rapid heating resulting in surface features up to 40 nm in height observed after annealing at 1200 °C.

The stratigraphic sequence of the Biblioteca Magliabechiana was investigated by integrating geomorphological, chronological, and archaeological information with micromorphological and soil analytical data. This combination of approaches resulted in the identification of an early phase of Dark Earth formation (7 th century A.

Where data are available, these lavas also have high ^(3) He/^(4) He.

40|$|Water is {{essential}} for life. This is a trivial fact but has profound implications since the forming {{of life on the}} early Earth required water. The sources of water and the related amount of delivery depend not only on the conditions on the early Earth itself but also on the evolutionary history of the solar system. Thus we ask where and when water formed in the solar nebula—the precursor of the solar system. In this paper we explore the chemical mechanics for water formation and its expected abundance. This is achieved by studying the parental cloud core of the solar nebula and its gravitational collapse. We have identified two different sources of water for the region of <b>Earth’s</b> <b>accretion.</b> The first being the sublimation of the icy mantles of dust grains formed in the parental cloud. The second source is located in the inner region of the collapsing cloud core - the so-called hot corino with a temperature of several hundred Kelvin.

30|$|Based on orbital {{calculations}} of Keplerian planetesimals incident {{on a planet}} with various initial orbital elements, we develop a numerical model which describes the accretional and dynamical evolution of planet-satellite systems in a swarm of planetesimals on heliocentric orbits with given spatial and velocity distributions. In the plane of orbital radius of the satellite vs. satellite/planet mass ratio, a satellite with some initial value moves quickly toward the balanced orbital radius, where accretion drag compensates with tidal repulsion, and then grows toward the equilibrium mass ratio. Using the model, we propose two types of co-accretion scenarios for {{the origin of the}} Moon, both of which satisfy the most fundamental dynamical constraints: the large angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system and the large Moon/Earth mass ratio. In the first scenario the Moon starts from a small embryo and grows in a swarm of planetesimals with low velocity dispersion and nonuniform spatial distribution, so that large spin angular momentum is supplied to the planet. Such a situation would be realized when the Earth grows up rapidly before dissipation of the solar nebula. Second one considers co-accretion after a giant impact during <b>Earth</b> <b>accretion,</b> which produces enough angular momentum as large as that of the present Earth-Moon system as well as a lunar-sized satellite. In this case, solar nebula would have already dissipated and random velocities of incident planetesimals are rather high, so that the Earth grows slowly.

40|$|The {{origin of}} water and the related {{significance}} for the early Earth depend on the conditions in the different stages of the solar nebula and the later solar system. With our model we simulate the chemical and hydrodynamic processes of the solar nebula. For that purpose we explicitly consider {{the evolution of the}} parental cloud core, its gravitational collapse, and the resulting turbulent disk. As a consequence of the low temperature (8 K) {{in the center of the}} cloud core thick ice layers are formed on the dust grains. The collapse is simulated using a new semi-analytic multi-zone solution of the hydrodynamic equations which is valid for spherical symmetry. Initially, the density distribution of the inner zone represents a central clump from which the proto-sun and later the T Tauri Sun form. The two outer zones evolve into a disk and a thin but spatially extended envelope. The disk stage is described by a stationary model and considers a weakly coupled gas and dust phase. We have identified two different sources of water for the region of Earth’s accretion. The first source is located in the inner region of the collapsing cloud core where the temperature could reach about 500 K. There, water was produced efficiently by gas phase reactions between neutral molecules. The second source is related to icy mantles of dust grains formed in the cloud core and disk stage. In the course of disk evolution cooling caused an enrichment of the dust phase with water ice beyond the snowline which moved inwards, i. e. into the <b>Earth</b> <b>accretion</b> zone.

40|$|The isotopic {{compositions}} {{of terrestrial}} hydrogen and nitrogen are clearly {{different from those}} of the nebular gas from which the solar system formed, and also differ from most of cometary values. Terrestrial N and H isotopic compositions are in the range of values characterizing primitive meteorites, which suggests that water, nitrogen, and other volatile elements on Earth originated from a cosmochemical reservoir that also sourced the parent bodies of primitive meteorites. Remnants of the proto-solar nebula (PSN) are still present in the mantle, presumably signing the sequestration of PSN gas at an early stage of planetary growth. The contribution of cometary volatiles appears limited to a few percents at most of the total volatile inventory of the Earth. The isotope signatures of H, N, Ne and Ar can be explained by mixing between two end-members of solar and chondritic compositions, respectively, and do not require isotopic fractionation during hydrodynamic escape of an early atmosphere. The terrestrial inventory of 40 Ar (produced by the decay of 40 K throughout the Earth's history) suggests that a significant fraction of radiogenic argon may be still trapped in the silicate Earth. By normalizing other volatile element abundances to this isotope, it is proposed that the Earth is not as volatile-poor as previously thought. Our planet may indeed contain up to ~ 3000 ppm water (preferred range : 1000 - 3000 ppm), and up to ~ 500 ppm C, both largely sequestrated in the solid Earth. This volatile content is equivalent to a ~ 2 (+/- 1) % contribution of carbonaceous chondrite (CI-CM) material to a dry proto-Earth, which is higher than the contribution of chondritic material advocated to account for the platinum group element budget of the mantle.

We assess the sensitivity of impact outcome to collision conditions, in particular how the mass, angular momentum, composition and origin (target vs. impactor) of the material placed into circumterrestrial orbit vary with impact angle, speed, impactor-to-target mass ratio, and initial thermal state of the colliding objects. The most favorable conditions for producing a sufficiently massive and iron-depleted protolunar disk involve collisions with an impact angle near 45 degrees and an impactor velocity at infinity < 4 km/sec. For a total mass and angular momentum near to that of the current Earth-Moon system, such impacts typically place about a lunar mass of material into orbits exterior to the Roche limit, with the orbiting material composed of 10 to 30 % vapor by mass. In all cases, {{the vast majority of the}} orbiting material originates from the impactor, consistent with previous findings. By mapping the end fate (escaping, orbiting, or in the planet) of each particle and the peak temperature it experiences durin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHigh 3 He/ 4 He ratios in some basalts have {{generally}} been interpreted as originating in an incompletely degassed lower-mantle source 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This helium source may have been isolated at the core-mantle boundary region since <b>Earth's</b> <b>accretion</b> 4, 5, 6. Alternatively, it may have taken part in whole-mantle convection and crust production {{over the age of}} the Earth 7, 8, 9; if so, it is now either a primitive refugium at the core-mantle boundary 8 or is distributed throughout the lower mantle 7, 9. Here we constrain the problem using lavas from Baffin Island, West Greenland, the Ontong Java Plateau, Isla Gorgona and Fernandina (Galapagos). Olivine phenocryst compositions show that these lavas originated from a peridotite source that was about 20 per cent higher in nickel content than in the modern mid-ocean-ridge basalt source. Where data are available, these lavas also have high 3 He/ 4 He. We propose that a less-degassed nickel-rich source formed by core-mantle interaction during the crystallization of a melt-rich layer or basal magma ocean 5, 6, and that this source continues to be sampled by mantle plumes. The spatial distribution of this source may be constrained by nickel partitioning experiments at the pressures of the core-mantle boundary...|$|R
