In cultivated and built up areas, smaller flocks form where food is provided for livestock or birds. In such places, it associates with other seed-eating birds, such as the house sparrow, the Cape weaver, and weavers of the genus Euplectes. Birds from urban areas form large flocks seasonally and fly out to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning at night to roost.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: CEOs {{and their}} {{management}} teams {{decide how much}} a firm will <b>spend</b> on <b>IT.</b> Though managers make <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> decisions {{with the intent of}} generating value, such benefits are risky and not guaranteed (Dewan et al. 2007). While CEOs may perceive that <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> could translate into competitive advantage and increase productivity, they also realize that IT expense will reduce current net income and contain non-diversifiable risks. Our results suggest that boards of directors consider <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> an important contribution to the firm’s investment opportunity set and consequently provide incentives for CEOs to invest in IT. First, we find that IT expenses are associated with higher ratios of equity compensation, which suggests that boards of directors understand the uncertainty and risk profile of some <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> and therefore tie CEO compensation to future outcomes by placing greater weight on equity compensation. Second, we find that IT expenses are unrelated to CEO cash compensation, which suggests that BODs shield CEO cash compensation from the income-decreasing effects of <b>IT</b> <b>spending.</b> Third, we find that firms with both higher <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> and higher ratios of equity to total CEO compensation have higher market values. We conclude that the synergistic relationshi...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} years, IT {{governance}} {{has become a}} key focus area for IT stakeholders around the world, especially in companies with high <b>IT</b> <b>spend.</b> <b>IT</b> governance is about making choices about the <b>IT</b> <b>spend.</b> <b>It</b> uses a set of management practices by which business and IT management together determine the level of IT investment, decide where to invest IT resources, track IT performance, and establish the strategies and principles on which IT is managed. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the status of IT governance in the Top 20 <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> companies in South Africa. This descriptive study examines how IT governance is being implemented through number of IT governance practices and assesses the maturity levels of IT governance in the Top 20 <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> companies.

5|$|About {{the size}} of a rabbit, the tammar is among the {{smallest}} of the wallabies in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, <b>it</b> <b>spends</b> nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E

Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} the {{business}} value of information technology (IT) relate {{the market value of}} firms to <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> or <b>IT</b> capital using a linear specification of the relation between the business value of IT and IT investment. A linear specification implicitly assumes that returns to IT investments do not diminish as the level of <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> or capital increases, inconsistent with economic theory. In the study described here, we specify a model that has the property of diminishing returns to investments in IT. Using data on <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> from InformationWeek surveys, we provide support for an empirical specification that incorporates diminishing returns to <b>IT</b> <b>spending.</b> Companies cannot obtain sustainable competitive advantage through investments in IT alone because IT can be easily imitated (Clemons and Row 1991). This suggests that the business value of IT increases with a firmís investment in IT and decreases with investment by its industry peers. On the other hand, investment in new IT by many firms in an industry could lead to positive externalities that benefit the industry as a whole. For example, investments in systems that enable firms to interact more effectively with suppliers and customers may encourage greater investment in IT throughout the supply chain.

40|$|In {{their quest}} to {{evaluate}} the impact of (IT) on business productivity, researchers have looked at many IT-performance relations but have not looked directly at how <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> affects future firm performance. While some argue that {{the full impact of}} <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> is not realized until subsequent periods because it takes time for organizations to assimilate and take advantage of new IT capabilities, little evidence has been produced about the association between <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> and earnings in future periods.

5|$|The {{bog turtle}} is {{primarily}} diurnal, active {{during the day}} and sleeping at night. It wakes in the early morning, basks until fully warm, then begins its search for food. It is a seclusive species, making it challenging to observe in its natural habitat. During colder days, the bog turtle will spend much of its time in dense underbrush, underwater, or buried in mud. Such behavior is indicative of the bog turtle's ability to survive without oxygen. On warmer days, the bog turtle's activities include scavenging, mating (during early spring), and basking in sunlight, the last of which <b>it</b> <b>spends</b> {{a great deal of the}} day doing. However, the bog turtle usually takes shelter from the sun during the hottest part of the day. Occasionally, during times of extreme heat, the turtle will either estivate, or become subterranean, sometimes occupying networks of tunnels filled with water. At night, the bog turtle buries itself in soft tunnels.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog has been {{detected}} {{in a wide}} range of habitats. It is generally associated with coastal swamps, wetlands, marshes, dams, ditches, small rivers, woodlands, and forests, but populations have also been found at former industrial sites (for instance, the Brickpit). It has even been found in human vessels such as bathtubs. The requirements of its habitat have been difficult to determine, for it has been found {{in a wide range}} of water bodies except fast-flowing streams. It is most typically found in short-lived freshwater ponds that are still, shallow, unshaded, and unpolluted, and it tends to avoid waters that contain predatory fish, whether native or introduced. However, it is most often found in areas that have been affected by human habitation. The frog prefers water bodies that support emergent vegetation, such as reeds and bullrushes, for basking, and winter habitats consist of available shelters around the breeding site, which can be vegetation, rocks, rubbish, or human debris and discarded building materials. Grassy habitats are usually close at hand to provide suitable terrestrial feeding grounds. It prefers waterways with a substrate of sand, rock, or clay, and can tolerate a wide range of water turbidities, pH and oxygen levels, and temperatures, although these can hamper physical growth. Although its legs provide much grip, the frog does not choose to climb trees or live up them to any significant extent. <b>It</b> <b>spends</b> most of its time within 10cm of the ground and rarely ventures more than a metre above the ground. The green and golden bell frog also has the ability to sit still for several minutes.|$|E
40|$|Although {{recent studies}} have found a {{positive}} relationship between spending on information technology and firm productivity, the magnitude of this relationship has not been as dramatic as one would expect given the anecdotal evidence. Data collected by the Bureau of the Census is analyzed to investigate the relationship between plant-level productivity and <b>spending</b> on <b>IT.</b> This relationship is investigated by separating the manufacturing plants in the sample along two dimensions, total factor productivity and <b>IT</b> <b>spending.</b> Analysis along these dimensions reveals that there are significant differences between the highest and lowest productivity plants. The highest productivity plants tend to <b>spend</b> less on <b>IT</b> while the lowest productivity plants tend to <b>spend</b> more on <b>IT.</b> Although there is support for the idea that lower productivity plants are <b>spending</b> more on <b>IT</b> to compensate for their productivity shortcomings, the results indicate {{that this is not the}} only difference. The robustness of this finding is strengthened by investigating changes in productivity and <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> over time.

40|$|The way {{in which}} {{information}} technology (IT) impacts firm productivity is an enduring question in organizational research and practice. Rather than adopting the common explanation that <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> improves organizational performance, we hypothesize that <b>IT</b> <b>spending</b> determines the amount of IT assets, such as IT hardware, IT personnel, IT systems, and IT outsourcing, that can be acquired. These IT assets, in turn, affect productivity. The context of our study is the healthcare industry.

Analysis of panel data on acute-care centers provides support for our hypotheses.
