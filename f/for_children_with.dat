5|$|In 2011, Lim {{noted that}} the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all {{children}} {{have the opportunity to}} receive an education. However, she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> special needs were cumbersome. Furthermore, education <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> special needs was not subject to the same subsidies that students in mainstream schools had. She thus brought to the House's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E

5|$|AAC {{systems for}} this {{population}} generally begin with communication boards and/or object or picture exchanges such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals with autism, provides communication to those {{with little or no}} functional speech, and has some limited positive impact on social interaction and challenging behaviours. A study that compared the use of a speech generating device to a picture exchange system found that both were reasonable options <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> autism, as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.|$|E

5|$|LGBT {{themes in}} comics are a {{relatively}} new concept, as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) themes and characters were historically omitted intentionally from the content of comic books and their comic strip predecessors, due to either censorship or the perception that comics were <b>for</b> <b>children.</b> <b>With</b> any mention of homosexuality in mainstream United States comics forbidden by the Comics Code Authority (CCA) until 1989, earlier attempts at exploring these issues in the US {{took the form of}} subtle hints or subtext regarding a character's sexual orientation. LGBT themes were tackled earlier in underground comix from the early 1970s onward. Independently published one-off comic books and series, often produced by gay creators and featuring autobiographical storylines, tackled political issues of interest to LGBT readers.|$|E

5|$|Póvoa de Varzim has public, denominational and {{independent}} {{schools in the}} city and outskirts. Public education in the municipality is provided by five school districts: Flávio Gonçalves, Cego do Maio, Aver-o-Mar, Campo Aberto, and Rates. These school districts arrange kindergartens and schools to the 9th grade of different locations of the municipality and are headed by Escolas de Educação Básica do 2.° e 3.°Ciclo (6th to the 9th grade schools) that give the name to each district. Private schools are primarily run by Catholic parishes or groups, the most notable of which is the Colégio do Sagrado Coração de Jesus.

5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. <b>For</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E
