Lewis shows that {{apart from the}} settling to {{a lower level of}} stable population, further declines were caused by over-harvesting in two of the three English trading posts (Albany and York). The data from the third trading post are also very interesting in that the post did not come under French pressure and was therefore shielded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> over-exploitation of stocks which resulted at the other trading posts. At Fort Churchill, the stocks of beaver adjusted to the maximum sustained yield level. The data from Churchill further reinforce the case of over-exploitation of stocks caused by the French-English competition.|$|E
25|$|Violence in Portuguese schools {{became an}} {{educational}} {{issue for the}} first time during the 1990s, mainly through the persistence of parental associations and teacher claims. However, it must be said that {{this was not the first}} time that violence appeared in Portuguese schools as a significant situation. After the 25 de Abril revolution of 1974 the occurrence of violent situations reached the highest point. This was a politically socialized and framed violence, quite different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> violence we can find today. That one had political programs, this one is quite anomic. Its origin is very diverse, from poverty to psychological problems. Theft, random or systematic physical aggression, bullying, destruction of school or teachers properties are realities which become current in many schools.|$|E

They made extensive confidential plans for the admission of their first black students. A faculty guardian and tutor was secretly appointed for each {{to help with the}} transition. The campus police department was instructed to prevent or quickly stop any incident against the two black students.

The legislation did not pass. In 1841, he was elected in the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician.|$|E

She considered that Schaffer's previous experience directing short comic videos for Saturday Night Live was partially responsible for individual comic moments broken up by transitions where [...] "things tend to fall apart". Screencrushs Matt Singer was positive, calling the film funny and praising the improvisational feel of the scenes and [...] "ingenious" [...] set-pieces, but was critical of the promotion of Costco and Costco products throughout. Boxoffices James Rocchi offered a positive stance, stating that the [...] "plot moves, the supporting cast is lively and the action stays small-scale and intimate, never overwhelming the laughs"; {{he felt that the}} profanity and vulgarity never became [...] "stale". Rocchi, however, commented that the film was forgettable and [...] "disposable".|$|E

500|$|His career {{boosted by}} his sudden {{international}} fame, Kurosawa, now {{reunited with his}} original film studio, Toho (which {{would go on to}} produce his next 11 films), set to work on his next project, Ikiru. The movie stars Takashi Shimura as a cancer-ridden Tokyo bureaucrat, Watanabe, on a final quest for meaning before his death. For the screenplay, Kurosawa brought in Hashimoto as well as writer Hideo Oguni, who would go on to co-write 12 Kurosawa films. Despite the work's grim subject matter, the screenwriters took a satirical approach, which some have compared to the work of Brecht, to both the bureaucratic world of its hero and the U.S. cultural colonization of Japan. (American pop songs figure prominently in the film.) Because of this strategy, the filmmakers are usually credited with saving the picture <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> sentimentality common to dramas about characters with terminal illnesses. Ikiru opened in October 1952 to rave reviews—it won Kurosawa his second Kinema Junpo [...] "Best Film" [...] award—and enormous box office success. It remains the most acclaimed of all the artist's films set in the modern era.|$|E

He has the power of absorbing and redirecting kinetic and radiated energy. Producer Lauren Shuler Donner said Bacon was considered for Shaw for being an actor who could convey a villain [...] "with different shades, that's not always clear that he's the bad guy". Vaughn added that Bacon [...] "had that bravado that Shaw needed", while stating that the actor was his top choice along with Colin Firth. Bacon accepted the role as he was a fan of Vaughn's Kick-Ass, and liked both the character of Shaw and the script, which he described as [...] "a fresh look at the franchise, but also the comic book movies in general". The actor considered that Shaw was a sociopath to whom [...] "the morality of the world did not apply", with producer Simon Kinberg adding that Bacon portrayed him as [...] "somebody, who in his mind, is the hero of the movie". Bacon also said that, [...] "aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> evil side, I portrayed him as kind of a Hugh Hefner type". Vaughn discarded Shaw's look from the comics as he felt he would [...] "look like an Austin Powers villain".|$|E
500|$|Procter's {{popularity}} continued {{after her}} death; {{the first volume}} of Legends and Lyrics went through 19 editions by 1881, and the second through 14 editions by the same year. Many of her poems were made into hymns or otherwise set to music. [...] Among these was [...] "The Lost Chord", which Arthur Sullivan set to music in 1877; this song was the most commercially successful of the 1870s and 1880s in both Britain and the United States. Her work was also published in the United States and translated into German. By 1938, Procter's reputation had fallen so far that a textbook could mention her poems only to pronounce them [...] "stupid, trivial and not worthy of the subject". Critics such as Cheri Larsen Hoeckley, Kathleen Hickok, and Natalie Joy Woodall argue that the demise of Procter's reputation is due at least in part to the way Charles Dickens characterized her as a [...] "model middle-class domestic angel" [...] and a [...] "fragile and modest saint" [...] rather than as an [...] "active feminist and strong poet." [...] Emma Mason argues that although Dickens's portrayal of Procter [...] "extinguished modern interest" [...] in her, it also [...] "has helped rescue Procter <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> endless conjecture about her private life that has confused studies of women like Letitia Landon." ...|$|E

Commenting on why he chose this script, Lynch said that [...] "that's what I {{fell in love with}} next", and displayed his admiration for Straight, describing him as [...] "like James Dean, except he's old".

[...] A schism was becoming more apparent among the officials, and subsequently Vorilhon dismissed all of them. [...] Their positions were replaced by an inner circle of seven people whose mission was to inform the public of the Raëlian messages and to raise funds for building an embassy for extraterrestrials.

Mr. Carpenter is an extremely resourceful director whose ability to construct films entirely out of action and movement suggests that he may one day be a director to rank with Don Siegel." [...] Jeffrey Wells of Films In Review wrote, [...] "Skillfully paced and edited, Assault was rich with Hawksian dialogue and humor, especially in the clever caricature of the classic 'Hawks woman' by Laurie Zimmer." [...] Tom Allen and Andrew Sarris of the Village Voice described the film as [...] "one of the most stylishly kinetic independent films of the 1970s." [...] Alan Jones of Starburst wrote, [...] "Bravura remake of Rio Bravo." [...] Dave Golder of SFX magazine hailed the film as, [...] "A superb, bloody thriller about a siege in an abandoned L.A. cop station." [...] In his book The Horror Films of the 1970s, John Kenneth Muir gave the film three and a half stars, calling it [...] "a lean, mean exciting horror motion picture... a movie of ingenuity, cunning and thrills." [...] Mick Martin & Marsha Porter of the Video Movie Guide gave the film four and a half stars out of five, writing, [...] "…John Carpenter's riveting movie about a nearly deserted L.A. police station that finds itself under siege by a youth gang. It's a modern day version of Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo, with exceptional performances by the entire cast." [...] In 2003, Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly described Assault as [...] "a tight, tense thriller … Carpenter's eerie score and Douglas Knapp's stylish cinematography give this low-budget shoot-out all the weight of an urban Rio Bravo." [...] Leonard Maltin also gave the film three and a half stars out of four: [...] "A nearly deserted L.A. police station finds itself under a state of siege by a youth gang in this riveting thriller, a modern-day paraphrase of Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo. Writer/director Carpenter also did the eerie music score for this knockout." ...|$|E
