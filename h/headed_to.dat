Having thought for two months prior {{that they would not}} compete in the Giro, most of Astana's riders had planned to take a break during the Tour of Italy, and Contador was actually vacationing on a beach when Bruyneel called him to tell him the team was <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> the Giro.|$|E
5|$|Between 1847 and 1870, the {{population}} of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000.

Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, began regular service from San Francisco to Panama, where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships <b>headed</b> <b>to</b> the East Coast. One ill-fated journey, that of the S.S.
