25|$|The out-sized {{political}} {{personality of}} Johnson, of course, was the dominating presence at lunch. <b>From</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch</b> Helms {{marveled at the}} learned way President Johnson employed the primary contradictions in his personality to direct those around him, and forcefully manage the atmosphere of discourse.|$|E
25|$|After {{one term}} as mayor, Clark {{narrowly}} defeated incumbent Republican Senator James H. Duff in the 1956 Senate election. Clark {{earned a reputation}} as a strong supporter of civil rights and worked to appoint liberal committee members <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch</b> on the Democratic Steering Committee. Clark narrowly won re-election in 1962 but was defeated in 1968 by Congressman Richard Schweiker. His defeat is generally credited to his support of gun control and opposition to the Vietnam War. After leaving office, Clark became a professor at Temple University.|$|E
2500|$|... : The Birdman {{is one of}} Tetsuo's elite psychic shocktroops. He wears a {{blindfold}} and {{is frequently}} standing atop ruined buildings and rafters, observing and reporting on the goings-on within the Empire's turf, and essentially acting as a security system. It is implied that his psychic powers allow him to sense sights and sounds from a great distance, further embodied by the all-seeing eye drawn on his forehead. Birdman dies when Yamada knocks him <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch,</b> causing him to fall to his death.|$|E
60|$|He became {{faint and}} felt {{for a minute}} that he must fall <b>from</b> <b>his</b> lofty <b>perch.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll ask Uncle Dan'l to {{take him}} home with us," [...] said Toby as he slipped down <b>from</b> <b>his</b> high <b>perch</b> and started towards the tent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Any {{political}} news from below, Bill?" [...] he asked, {{as the latter}} slowly descended <b>from</b> <b>his</b> lofty <b>perch,</b> without, however, any perceptible coming down of mien or manner.|$|R
2500|$|Second, Sibelius's [...] "deeply idiosyncratic" [...] idiom was too [...] "personal" [...] {{to serve}} {{adequately}} as a [...] "foundation" [...] {{upon which to}} build a school of musical thought. That Madetoja's own musical style shows the mark of Sibelius {{is a testament to}} the longer duration and greater depth of his instruction under Sibelius; Kuula, who only briefly studied with Sibelius, shows no such influence. Finally, Sibelius—prone to periods of self-doubt and ever-concerned with his standing in artistic circles—was mistrustful of the next generation of composers, fearing one might displace him <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch.</b> ("Youth has a right to make its voice heard. One sees oneself as a father figure to them all", Sibelius confided to his diary. [...] " [...] they don't give a damn about you. Perhaps with reason.") ...|$|E
60|$|That was {{the signal}} for Duane to drop down <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch,</b> yet despite his care {{he made a}} noise.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not stop}} {{to say goodbye to}} his brother. Descending <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch,</b> he hurried to the stage door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha! ha! ha! ha!" [...] cried Otter again <b>from</b> <b>his</b> airy <b>perch.</b> [...] "Treachery! treachery! And what if {{the slaves}} are loosed? And {{what if the}} gates be barred?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{the old man}} {{slipped down}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> uncomfortable <b>perch,</b> stopped {{at the door to}} warn Jim and Dody that they must not stray far away, and {{disappeared}} behind the ruins of the tavern.|$|R
60|$|Dave {{had come}} down <b>from</b> <b>his</b> high <b>perch</b> in a hurry, and {{in a very short}} time was ready to leave the spot. Merwell gave a deep sigh, for he did not relish confronting his former schoolmates.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{they were}} gone, Jerry came down <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch,</b> and off they started once more for the island.|$|E
60|$|Buck Mulligan {{frowned at}} the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch</b> and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Shall I {{ring for}} ye?' said the cabman, who had descended <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch,</b> and was {{slapping}} his chest, {{for the night}} was bitter.|$|E
60|$|Then she sat the egg gently {{upon the}} top of the stone wall, where there was a little hollow; and Humpty was delighted, for <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{elevated}} <b>perch</b> he could see much better than the Princess herself.|$|R
50|$|Hal Gurnee's Network Time Killers: Introduced {{during the}} summer of 1988 (after Late Night had {{returned}} from a lengthy hiatus due to a Writers Guild strike), the feature included Hal Gurnee introducing bizarre time-killing features <b>from</b> <b>his</b> director's <b>perch</b> in the control room.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan of the Apes {{watched them}} for a while <b>from</b> <b>his</b> lofty <b>perch</b> in the great tree. There was much in their {{demeanor}} which he could not understand, for of superstition he was ignorant, and of fear of any kind he had but a vague conception.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is, sir," [...] {{said the}} first clerk, {{descending}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch</b> {{with an air of}} good-will, and requesting the visitor's name and business.|$|E
60|$|I routed him {{promptly}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch,</b> {{stuck his}} hat on, put his instrument in his pocket, {{and set off}} with him for Edinburgh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ain't, neither!" [...] howled another lad <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch.</b> [...] "Mad dogs won't drink; {{and this}} one is lapping out of a tub of water." ...|$|E
60|$|So Tarzan fitted a {{poisoned}} arrow to his bow {{and drew}} a bead upon the rat-faced sailor, but the foliage was so thick that he soon saw the arrow would be deflected by the leaves or some small branch, and instead he launched a heavy spear <b>from</b> <b>his</b> lofty <b>perch.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Williamson {{was hired}} by Prime Minister Stephen Harper to become {{director}} of communications in the PMO and oversaw government-wide communications <b>from</b> <b>his</b> PMO <b>perch.</b> He stepped down in 2010 in order to prepare his campaign after deciding to run for elected office, and was succeeded as director of communications by Dimitri Soudas.|$|R
6000|$|At Lawton he had parted <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{friend and}} gone on alone, having laid {{in a store}} of {{gingerbread}} from a baker's cart, and paused to eat, drink, and rest by a wayside brook. A few miles further he passed a party of girls playing lawn tennis, and as he slowly rolled along regarding them <b>from</b> <b>his</b> lofty <b>perch,</b> one suddenly exclaimed:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'That settles Cheeko!' Mr. Crow cried <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch</b> on the tree. 'He'll {{stay where}} he is till Tommy gets ready to take him out.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall I {{ring for}} ye?" [...] said the cabman, who had descended <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch,</b> and was {{slapping}} his chest, {{for the night}} was bitter.|$|E
60|$|A shot {{rang out}} in the evening air. Hyacinth stooped down <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch</b> and {{put his finger on}} the bolt. The sow pressed furiously against the door.|$|E
60|$|Here the man struck {{upon the}} panels {{of the door}} with the butt of his spear, and when it opened in {{response}} to his signal he passed in with his lions. Beyond the open door Tarzan, <b>from</b> <b>his</b> distant <b>perch,</b> caught but a fleeting glimpse of life within the city, just enough to indicate that there were other human creatures who abode there, and then the door closed.|$|R
60|$|Having {{made this}} {{somewhat}} bold prediction, Maggot collected all his energies, and sprang <b>from</b> <b>his</b> narrow <b>perch</b> into the air, with {{arms and hands}} wildly extended. His effort was well and bravely made, but his position had been too constrained, and his foothold too insecure, to admit of a good jump. He missed the rope, and, with a loud cry, shot like an arrow into the boiling flood below.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, certainly," [...] said Mr. News, and {{accordingly}} James {{was summoned}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> elevated <b>perch,</b> {{where he was}} once more going through his notes and the heads of his opening speech, although he already knew his brief--which, to do it justice, had been prepared with extraordinary care and elaboration--almost by heart, and next moment, {{for the first time}} in his life, found himself in consultation with an Attorney and a Solicitor-General.|$|R
60|$|Frank, who was {{as quick}} as the hounds, almost rode them down in his eagerness. While Jones descended <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch,</b> I led the two horses down the forest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Either the man {{was drunk}} or criminally malicious," [...] he said that afternoon, <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch</b> on the bed, when Brissenden had arrived and dropped limply into the one chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{all ready}} aloft," [...] said he. [...] "I'll go {{up with you}} if I may." [...] He sprang down <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>perch</b> and joined {{the others in the}} lift.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen, distant as {{the murderer}} was <b>from</b> <b>his</b> doomed victim, {{he did not}} wholly escape injury. This {{fragment}} of wood which I now exhibit to you struck him. It drew blood. Wherever he is, he bears the telltale mark. I picked it up where he stood when he fired the fatal train." [...] He {{looked out over the}} house <b>from</b> <b>his</b> high <b>perch,</b> and <b>his</b> countenance began to darken; he slowly raised his hand, and pointed-- ...|$|R
60|$|But {{when the}} pony team was driven {{up to the}} door, and Toby {{decorated}} the bridles of the little horses with some of Aunt Olive's roses, Mr. Stubbs's brother came down <b>from</b> <b>his</b> high <b>perch,</b> and picked some of the flowers for himself, putting them over his ears to imitate the ponies; then he gravely seated himself in the carriage, and Toby had no difficulty in fastening the cord to his collar again.|$|R
60|$|He {{glanced back}} and saw her rise, snatch the rose from the knight's hand, throw it down and stamp upon it. Then he saw and heard no more for he was through the gate and running down the square. At its end, as he turned into some street, he was {{surprised}} to hear a gruff voice calling to him to stop. On looking up he saw that it came <b>from</b> <b>his</b> enemy, the hansom-cab man, who was apparently keeping a lookout on the square <b>from</b> <b>his</b> lofty <b>perch.</b>|$|R
