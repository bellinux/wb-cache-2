There remained the possibility, because the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 landing sites were closely associated with the Imbrium basin, that different geologic processes were prevalent in areas of the lunar highlands far from Mare Imbrium. Several members of the scientific community remarked that the central lunar highlands resembled regions on Earth that were created by volcanic processes and hypothesized the same might be true on the Moon. They had hoped that scientific output from the Apollo 16 mission would provide an answer.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{recognized}} {{two classes of}} geological feature on Oberon: craters and chasmata ('canyons'—deep, elongated, steep-sided depressions which would probably be described as rift valleys or escarpments if on Earth). Oberon's surface is the most heavily cratered of all the Uranian moons, with a crater density approaching saturation—when the formation of new craters is balanced by destruction of old ones. This high number of craters indicates that Oberon has the most ancient surface among Uranus's moons. The crater diameters range up to 206 kilometers for the largest known crater, Hamlet. Many large craters are surrounded by bright impact ejecta (rays) consisting of relatively fresh ice. The largest craters, Hamlet, Othello and Macbeth, have floors made of a very dark material deposited after their formation. A peak with a height of about 11km was observed in some Voyager images near the south-eastern limb of Oberon, {{which may be the}} central peak of a large <b>impact</b> <b>basin</b> with a diameter of about 375km. Oberon's surface is intersected by a system of canyons, which, however, are less widespread than those found on Titania. The canyons' sides are probably scarps produced by normal faults which can be either old or fresh: the latter transect the bright deposits of some large craters, indicating that they formed later. The most prominent Oberonian canyon is Mommur Chasma.|$|E
25|$|The largest impacts {{produced}} melt {{sheets of}} molten rock that covered {{portions of the}} surface that could be as thick as a kilometer. Examples of such impact melt {{can be seen in}} the northeastern part of the Mare Orientale <b>impact</b> <b>basin.</b>|$|E

Very few QCDs have closely coincident magnetization anomalies, and only the oldest of the very large <b>impact</b> <b>basins</b> have strong magnetic anomalies within their main rings. Crustal thickness data show a large number of Circular Thinned Areas (CTAs).

A problem region is the small number of large (D greater than 500) <b>impact</b> <b>basins</b> seen in the relatively well preserved cratered terrain of the south polar region. This region was mapped in detail, searching for evidence of ancient, highly degraded <b>impact</b> <b>basins</b> for two reasons: To determine whether the apparent absence of large <b>impact</b> <b>basins</b> is due to incomplete mapping and recognition or a fundamental characteristic of the Martian crust related to the origin of the Martian crustal dichotomy, and whether ancient <b>impact</b> <b>basins</b> exert some control on the distribution of volcanic and polar deposits in the Southern Hemisphere and on the topography on which these deposits lie.

It was discovered by MESSENGER during its second flyby of Mercury on October 6, 2008. The crater is 3.9 billion years old, and was created during the period of Late Heavy Bombardment. The density and size distribution of impact craters along Rembrandt's rim indicate that it is one of the youngest impact basins on Mercury.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{the lunar}} samples seems to imply that a {{significant}} percentage {{of the lunar}} impact basins formed within {{a very short period of}} time between about 4 and 3.85 Ga ago. This hypothesis is referred to as the lunar cataclysm or late heavy bombardment. However, it is now recognized that ejecta from the Imbrium <b>impact</b> <b>basin</b> (one of the youngest large impact basins on the Moon) should be found at all of the Apollo landing sites. It is thus possible that ages for some impact basins (in particular Mare Nectaris) could have been mistakenly assigned the same age as Imbrium.|$|E
25|$|The Nectarian period {{encompasses}} {{all events}} that occurred between {{the formation of the}} Nectaris and Imbrium impact basins. 12 multi-ring impact basins are recognized in the Nectarian period, including the Serenitatis and Crisium basins. One of the scientific objectives of the Apollo 16 mission was to date material excavated by the Nectaris <b>impact</b> <b>basin.</b> Nevertheless, the age of the Nectaris basin is somewhat contentious, with the most frequently cited numbers being 3.92 Ga, and less frequently 3.85 Ga.

50|$|Gravity and {{topography}} {{data show}} that crustal thickness on Mars is resolved into two major peaks, with modal thicknesses of 32 km and 58 km in {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres, respectively.

25|$|A {{large portion}} of maria erupted within, or flowed into, the low-lying impact basins on the lunar nearside. However, it is {{unlikely}} that a causal relationship exists between the impact event and mare volcanism because the impact basins are much older (by about 500 million years) than the mare fill. Furthermore, Oceanus Procellarum, which is the largest expanse of mare volcanism on the Moon, does not correspond to any known <b>impact</b> <b>basin.</b> It is commonly suggested that the reason the mare only erupted on the nearside is that the nearside crust is thinner than the farside. Although variations in the crustal thickness might act to modulate the amount of magma that ultimately reaches the surface, this hypothesis does not explain why the farside South Pole-Aitken basin, whose crust is thinner than Oceanus Procellarum, was only modestly filled by volcanic products.|$|E
25|$|The northwest-trending {{component}} of the postulated global grid of fractures is markedly absent in the Borealis region. Northeast-trending scarps and troughs are conspicuous, however, across intercrater plains material and in crater fill (smooth plains material) between the 155° and 185° meridians, and from crater Van Dijck northward to crater Purcell and beyond. The scarps tend to be straight in intercrater plains material, but become notably lobate in crater fill (for example, within Saikaku). This set of northeast-trending scarps and troughs, and another set of north-trending scarps and troughs within and north of crater Van Dijck, probably follow zones of structural weakness in the mercurian crust. Ancient fractures that were reactivated by later impacts may have first provided the conduits for crater fill (smooth plains material) and later been propagated upward through the fill. That these ridges, scarps, and troughs are parts of a global grid of fractures cannot be stated conclusively because of their proximity to the terminator {{and the lack of}} photographic coverage beyond the 190° meridian. Some scarps probably were formed by normal faulting of the smooth plains material that covers some crater floors, as in the Kuiper quadrangle (Scott and others, 1980). We cannot, however, determine whether most lineaments are internal or are parts of a faulted and lineated facies associated with a nearby but unphotographed <b>impact</b> <b>basin.</b> Melosh (1977) predicted that normal east-trending faults would form in high Mercurian latitudes as a result of slight crustal shortening. His predicted faults may be represented by a generally east-northeast-trending scarp and a lineament that cut across intermediate plains material and the crater Jókai between the 125° and 155° meridians. The north pole is too close to the terminator to detect {{the presence or absence of}} a “polygonal arrangement without preferred orientation,” as predicted by Melosh and Dzurisin (1978, p. 233).|$|E
500|$|After the {{formation}} of the planets, all were subjected to the so-called [...] "Late Heavy Bombardment". About 60% of the surface of Mars shows a record of impacts from that era, whereas much of the remaining surface is probably underlain by immense impact basins caused by those events. There is evidence of an enormous <b>impact</b> <b>basin</b> in the northern hemisphere of Mars, spanning , or roughly four {{times the size of the}} Moon's South Pole – Aitken basin, the largest <b>impact</b> <b>basin</b> yet discovered. This theory suggests that Mars was struck by a Pluto-sized body about four billion years ago. The event, thought to be the cause of the Martian hemispheric dichotomy, created the smooth Borealis basin that covers 40% of the planet.|$|E
50|$|The {{multiple}} impact {{hypothesis is}} supported by correlation of segments of the dichotomy with the rims of several large <b>impact</b> <b>basins.</b> But there are {{large parts of the}} Borealis Basin outside the rims of those <b>impact</b> <b>basins.</b> If the Martian lowlands were formed by the multiple basins then their inner ejecta and rims should stand above upland elevations. The rims and ejecta blankets of the lowland impact craters are still much below the upland areas. There are also areas in the lowlands that are outside any of the <b>impact</b> <b>basins,</b> these areas must be overlain by multiple ejecta blankets and should stand at elevations similar to the original planetary surface. That clearly is not the case either. One approach explaining the absence of ejecta blankets infers that no ejecta was ever present. Absence of ejecta could be caused by a large impactor scattering the ejecta into outer space. Another approach proposed the formation of the dichotomy by cooling at depth and crustal loading by later volcanism. The multiple-impact hypothesis is also statistically unfavorable, it is unlikely that multiple <b>impacts</b> <b>basins</b> occur and overlap primarily in the northern hemisphere.|$|R

The volcanic plains and volcanic edifices on Mars which show a complex distribution are the interiors of the most obvious old basins are largely buried by wind blown deposits.

500|$|Empirical {{observations}} {{suggest that}} the lower limit will {{vary according to the}} composition and thermal history of the object. For a body made of rigid silicates, such as the stony asteroids, the transition to hydrostatic equilibrium should occur at a diameter of approximately 600km and a mass of 3.4kg. For a body made of less rigid water ice, the limit should be about 320km and 1019kg. In the asteroid belt, Ceres is the only body that clearly surpasses the silicaceous limit (though it is actually a rocky–icy body), and its shape is an equilibrium spheroid. 2 Pallas and 4 Vesta are rocky and are just below the limit. Pallas, at 525–560km and 1.85–2.4kg, is [...] "nearly round" [...] but still somewhat irregular. Vesta, at 530km and 2.6kg, deviates from an ellipsoid shape primarily due to a large <b>impact</b> <b>basin</b> at its pole.|$|E

The largest confirmed of these is the Hellas <b>impact</b> <b>basin,</b> a light albedo feature clearly visible from Earth. Due to the smaller mass of Mars, the probability of an object colliding with the planet is about half that of Earth.

Mars {{is more likely to be}} struck by short-period comets, i.e., those that lie within the orbit of Jupiter.

500|$|Scientists have {{recognized}} three classes of geological feature on Titania: craters, chasmata (canyons) and rupes (scarps). The surface of Titania is less heavily cratered than {{the surfaces of}} either Oberon or Umbriel, which means that it is much younger.

Some craters (for instance, Ursula and Jessica) are surrounded by bright impact ejecta (rays) consisting of relatively fresh ice. All large craters on Titania have flat floors and central peaks. The only exception is Ursula, which has a pit in the center.

500|$|A {{mountain}} range measuring [...] long, [...] wide and [...] high was also discovered by Cassini in 2006.

Prior to Cassini, scientists assumed that most of the topography on Titan would be impact structures, yet these findings reveal that similar to Earth, the mountains were formed through geological processes. In December 2010, the Cassini mission team announced the most compelling possible cryovolcano yet found. Named Sotra Patera, it is one in a chain of at least three mountains, each between 1000 and 1500m in height, several of which are topped by large craters. The ground around their bases appears to be overlaid by frozen lava flows.|$|E

Several promising candidates, including a large pre-Hellas basin in the Malea Planum region and an older but comparably sized basin overlapping South Polar, were previously described.

40|$|The {{globally}} extensive smooth {{plains of}} Mercury {{are believed to}} be mostly volcanic in origin. Wide-spread effusive volcanism on Mercury is thought to have ended by ~ 3. 5 Ga due to secular cooling of the planet’s interior, and contraction of its lithosphere. As the planet cools and contracts, melt should be produced at a slower rate and in smaller volumes, so it will stall deeper and its escape routes will close. 3. 5 Ga corresponds roughly with the end of Mercury’s Calorian system. Smooth plains younger than this have been reported, but are restricted to the interiors of <b>impact</b> <b>basins,</b> such as Rachmaninoff. If widespread effusive volcanism on Mercury ceased in response to cooling and contraction during the Calorian, then Mansurian <b>impact</b> <b>basins</b> are good places to search for late-stage effusive volcanism. Effusive volcanism should be favoured in <b>impact</b> <b>basins,</b> because they remove overburden, promote uplift, temporarily reset the preexisting stress regime, propagate fractures and deposit heat. If cooling and contraction were the main factors that controlled the decline of widespread volcanism on Mercury, then post-impact volcanism should similarly become less voluminous throughout the Mansurian. Smaller basins should have less post-impact volcanism because they produce shallower pathways for melt. Post-impact volcanism should also become less common throughout the Mansurian as Mercury continues to cool. Considering these expectations, we are conducting a global survey of Mansurian <b>impact</b> <b>basins</b> to study how effusive volcanism on Mercury waned as a con-sequence of global cooling and contraction...|$|R
