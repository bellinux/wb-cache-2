50|$|<b>Etamsylate</b> limits {{capillary}} bleeding {{through its}} action on hyaluronic acid and initial studies showed {{a reduction in}} intraventricular haemorrhage. <b>Etamsylate</b> may also {{have an effect on}} the microcirculation, encouraging platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction and therefore haemostasis. It also inhibits the effects of the prostaglandin mediated vasodilatation and increased capillary permeability, thereby reducing oedema secondary to capillary leakage. It is also possible that <b>etamsylate</b> would reduce reperfusion haemorrhage in ischaemic areas of the brain, preventing secondary damage.|$|E

5000|$|The precise {{mechanism}} of action of <b>etamsylate</b> is unknown. It {{has been shown to}} reduce bleeding time and blood loss from wounds. This appears to relate to increased platelet aggregation mediated by a thromboxane A2 or prostaglandin F2a dependent mechanism. It has also been associated with decreased concentrations of 6-oxoprostaglandin F1a, a stable metabolite of prostacyclin. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator, and may be implicated in reperfusion; it is also a disaggregator of platelets. Whereas prostaglandins themselves may have a role in regulating cerebral blood flow, <b>etamsylate</b> appears to have no effect on cerebral blood flow. <b>Etamsylate</b> was also thought to stabilise capillaries, reinforcing capillary membranes by polymerising hyaluronic acid.|$|E
50|$|By {{inhibiting}} {{the effects}} of prostaglandins, <b>etamsylate</b> may exert an effect by closing the patent ductusand thereby increasing cerebral blood flow.|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: In this {{retrospective}} study we aimed {{to compare the}} effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) vs <b>etamsylate,</b> two hemostatic agents, on hematuria duration in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients with persistent gross hematuria. Methods: This is a {{retrospective study}} of 40 patients with ADPKD and macroscopic hematuria. 20 patients receiving TXA and snake venom blood clotting enzyme injection were compared with 20 matched patients receiving <b>etamsylate</b> and snake venom blood clotting enzyme injection. The primary outcome was hematuria duration and the secondary outcomes were blood transfusion requirements and adverse events. Results: The hematuria duration was shorter in the TXA group compared with the <b>etamsylate</b> group (4 [3 - 5] d vs 7 [6 - 10] d, P&#x 3 c; 0. 001). The volume of blood transfusion tended to be less in the TXA group than in the <b>etamsylate</b> group (300 ± 115 ml vs 486 ± 195 ml, P= 0. 12), {{and the number of}} patients needing a blood transfusion also tended to be lower [20 % (4 / 20) vs 35 % (7 / 20), P= 0. 29]. TXA and <b>etamsylate</b> were equally well tolerated and no serious adverse events were observed in both groups. Conclusions: Our study indicates that TXA treatment was more effective than <b>etamsylate</b> in stopping bleeding in ADPKD patients with persistent gross hematuria...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA new {{and simple}} HPLC assay method was {{developed}} and validated for the determination of <b>etamsylate</b> in human plasma. After protein precipitation with 6 % perchloric acid, satisfactory separation was achieved on a HyPURITY C 18 column (250 mm× 4. 6 mm, 5 μm) using a mobile phase comprising 20 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate- 2 hydrate (pH was adjusted to 3. 5 by phosphoric acid) and acetonitrile {{at a ratio of}} 95 : 5 v/v. The elution was isocratic at ambient temperature with a flow rate of 0. 75 ml/min. Allopurinol was used as internal standard. The calibration curve was linear over the range from 0. 25 to 20 μg/ml (r 2 = 0. 999). The limit of quantification for <b>etamsylate</b> in plasma was 0. 25 μg/ml. The within day coefficient of variance (%CV) ranged from 3. 9 % to 10. 2 %, whereas the between-day %CV ranged from 3. 1 % to 8. 7 %. The assay method has been successfully used to estimate the pharmacokinetics of <b>etamsylate</b> after oral administration of a 500 mg tablet under fasting conditions to 24 healthy Egyptian human male volunteers. Various pharmacokinetic parameters including AUC 0 –t, AUC 0 –∞, Cmax, Tmax, t 1 / 2, MRT, Cl/F, and Vd/F were determined from plasma concentration–time profile of <b>etamsylate...</b>|$|E

40|$|AIM—To {{assess the}} role of etamsylate* in {{reducing}} the risk of haemorrhagic brain damage and its consequences.  DESIGN—Follow up of babies recruited into a randomised controlled trial.  METHODS—A total of 334 infants born before 33 weeks gestation in France and Greece were randomly allocated within the first four hours of birth either to receive <b>etamsylate</b> or to act as controls. The principal outcomes in the trial were death or impairment and/or disability at the age of 2 years.  RESULTS—Fifty nine children were lost to follow up. A total of 115 (34 %) either died or had some impairment or disability, and 88 (26 %) either died or had severe impairment or disability at 2 years of age. These outcomes did not differ significantly between the two randomised groups: relative risks and 95 % confidence intervals 1. 14 (0. 78 to 1. 4) and 1. 17 (0. 82 to 1. 68) respectively. The findings were similar for all the prespecified subgroup analyses stratified by key prognostic factors at trial entry: country of birth, gestational age < or ⩾ 29 weeks, inborn or outborn, age < or ⩾ 1 hour, and with or without cerebral scan abnormality.  CONCLUSION—These findings do not support the use of <b>etamsylate.</b> Other strategies need to be evaluated for the prevention of mortality and morbidity in these vulnerable infants. ...|$|E
40|$|One titrimetric and two {{spectrophotometric}} methods {{which are}} simple, selective, sensitive, accurate, precise and economical for {{the determination of}} <b>etamsylate</b> (ETM) In bulk drug and In tablets employing permanganate as the oxidimetric reagent are described. In titrimetry, ETM is titrated directly with permanganate in sulphuric acid medium. A direct spectrophotometry (method A) involves treating the aqueous solution of the drug with permanganate in alkaline medium and measuring the bluish green product at 6 10 nm. In indirect spectrophotometry (method 8), the drug solution was treated with a fixed concentration of permanganate in H(2) SO(4) medium, and after a specified time the unreacted permanganate was measured at 545 nm. The molar combining ratio in titrimetry and the optimum assay conditions were studied. Titrimetry is applicable over 1 - 10 mg range and the calculations {{are based on a}} 1 : 4 (ETM:KMnO(4)) molar ratio. In spectrophotometry, Beer's law is obeyed over 0. 5 - 5. 0 and 1. 5 - - 15 mu g ml(- 1) for method A and B, respectively. The molar absorptivity values are calculated to be 2. 79 x 10 (4) and 4. 17 x 10 (4) / mol(- 1) cm(- 1) for method A and B, respectively and the corresponding sandell sensitivity values are 0 0094 and 0. 0063 mu g cm(- 2). The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) are also reported for spectrophotometric methods. The applicability of the developed methods was demonstrated by the determination of <b>etamsylate</b> in pure drug as well as in commercial dosage forms...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} two simple and selective spectrophotometric methods for the rapid determination of <b>etamsylate</b> (ETM) in bulk and in capsule formulations. The methods {{are based on}} the oxidation of ETM with ferric chloride in neutral medium and subsequent chelation of the resulting iron(II) with 1, 10 -phenanthroline (Phen) (method A) and with 2, 2 ’-bipyridyl (Bipy) (method B). The resulting red colored chromogens are measured at 510 and 520 nm, in method A and B, respectively. In both methods, the absorbance is found to increase linearly with increasing ETM concentration. Beer’s law is obeyed over the ranges 0. 5 - 10 and 0. 8 - 16 µg/ml for method A and B, respectively. The calculated molar absorptivity values are 2. 17 x 104 and 1. 65 x 104 l mol- 1 cm- 1 for method A and B, respectively, and the corresponding sandell sensitivities are 0. 012 and 0. 016 µg/cm 2.

40|$|Two {{simple and}} {{selective}} spectrophotometric methods were {{proposed for the}} assay of <b>etamsylate</b> (ETM) in bulk and dosage forms. The first method (method A) {{is based on the}} reaction of ETM with ferric chloride in DMF medium to form a colored species with a Î»max at 655 nm. The second method (method B) is based on the oxidative coupling reaction involving ETM, 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH) and ferric chloride in the presence of sodium acetate which yielded a bright pink colored chromogen with Î»max at 520 nm. The amt. of chromogen formed corresponds to the amt. of ETM and the measured absorbance is found to increase linearly with the concn. of ETM, which is corroborated by the correlation coeff. of 0. 999 in both the methods. Under optimum conditions, Beer's law is obeyed over the ranges 4. 0 - 140 and 1. 5 - 30 Î¼g mL- 1 for method A and method B resp. The calcd. molar absorptivity values are 1. 68 Ã— 103 and 7. 83 Ã— 103 L moL- 1 cm- 1 for method A and method B, resp. and the corresponding sandell sensitivities are 0. 156 and 0. 033 Î¼g cm- 2. The proposed methods were applied to the anal. of tablet forms of ETM and the results tallied well with the label claim. No interference was obsd. from concomitant substances normally added to tablets. The results were statistically compared with those of a literature method by applying the Student's t-test and F-test. The accuracy and validity of the methods were further ascertained by performing recovery studies via spike method. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
