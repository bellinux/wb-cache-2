5|$|Although {{mechanisation}} of the British cavalry {{was well}} advanced by 1939, {{there was still}} a 1st Cavalry Division that served in the Syria–Lebanon Campaign during the Second World War. Eventually all the cavalry regiments were mechanised and became part of the Household Cavalry and the Royal Armoured Corps. There is still one regiment that retains their horses, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, which together with the Household Cavalry Regiment was formed from the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals, which was <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> amalgamation of the Royal Horse Guards (Blues) and the 1st (Royal) Dragoons.|$|E
5|$|Kennywood Entertainment, <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> {{operator}} of a family-owned park, had acquired other family-owned and operated parks after its purchase of Idlewild in 1983. Kennywood's owners rejected offers by larger companies {{to purchase the}} group, such as one in 1997 by Premier Parks, the company that acquired the Six Flags franchise a year later. Kennywood refused the Premier offer and others on grounds that the new owners would make too many changes to the existing parks. However, on December 11, 2007, Kennywood Entertainment {{announced that it would}} sell its parks to the Madrid-based amusement company, Parques Reunidos. The fourth- and fifth-generation family ownership of Kennywood ensured that with the transaction all of the company's parks would experience few changes and that day-to-day park operations would remain local.|$|E

5|$|On November 3, 1835, Texas {{declared}} <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> independent state, and {{a provisional}} government was formed with Henry Smith of Brazoria elected provisional governor. Austin requested to be relieved of his {{command of the}} army, and Sam Houston was named army chief. Edward Burleson was chosen as temporary commander of the troops in San Antonio. Bowie appeared before the council at some point and spoke for an hour, asking for a commission. The council refused Bowie's request, likely because of lingering animosity over his land dealings.|$|E
5|$|On September1, 1982, {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} County Route51 (CR51) from CR110 north to US11 in Winthrop was transferred from St. Lawrence County {{to the state of}} New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. Also transferred to the state as part of the swap was CR110 <b>itself,</b> <b>an</b> east–west highway extending from Stockholm Center to Coteys Corner. The segment of CR51 given to New York became a southward extension of NY420, which now began at NY11C (former CR110) and briefly overlapped US11 in Winthrop. The alignments of US11 and NY11C between Stockholm Center and Coteys Corner were flipped on June13, 1992.|$|E
5|$|Parrish, {{upset with}} the {{ineffectiveness}} of the association, proposed forming a players' union, that would be independent of the NFLPA, {{with the assistance of}} the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). The IBT pushed for the NFLPA to join the trucking union. In early November 1967, Parrish, with support from former Cleveland Browns player Jim Brown, began distributing union cards to form a Teamsters affiliate known as the American Federation of Pro Athletes. The NFLPA rejected the overture at its meeting in Hollywood, Florida, during the first week of January 1968 and declared <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> independent union. Although Parrish's proposal was defeated, Miller left his position as counsel to the union. He was later replaced by two Chicago labor lawyers, Dan Schulman and Bernie Baum.|$|E

5|$|Six {{months after}} the NFLPA {{declared}} <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> independent union, many players were dissatisfied {{with the lack of}} compensation teams provided and voted to strike on July 3, 1968 after official discussions with the owners stalled. The owners countered by declaring a lockout. By July 14, 1968, the brief work stoppage came to an end. Although a CBA resulted, many players felt that the agreement did not net them as many benefits as they had hoped. The owners agreed to contribute about $1.5 million to the pension fund with minimum salaries of $9,000 for rookies, $10,000 for veterans and $50 per exhibition game; there was at yet no neutral arbitration for disputes.|$|E
5|$|Some active subwoofers use a servo {{feedback}} mechanism {{based on}} cone movement which modifies the signal {{sent to the}} voice coil. The servo feedback signal is derived from {{a comparison of the}} input signal to the amplifier versus the actual motion of the cone. The usual source of the feedback signal is a few turns of voice coil attached to the cone or a microchip-based accelerometer placed on the cone <b>itself.</b> <b>An</b> advantage of a well-implemented servo subwoofer design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible. The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Ranko brought {{together}} two popular fictional {{creatures of the}} 1930s; the giant ape King Kong, who had been introduced in the film King Kong (1933), and the Loch Ness Monster, a cryptid who was to have lived in Loch Ness. Gaston Leroux's character of Balaoo the gorilla, who had appeared in a 1911 book and a 1913 film, might also have been an influence on Ranko. The plot and themes of the story were also influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 film The 39 Steps, <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> adaptation of John Buchan's 1915 adventure novel.|$|E

5|$|The long-time {{informal}} {{emblem of}} the Tortoise Club (1st Summer VIII and 1st Torpid crews), was formalized in a grant to the College by Letters Patent dated 20 April 2009 of Garter, Clarenceux and Norroy and Ulster King of Arms. The Badge is blazoned A Tortoise displayed the shell circular Azure charged with two concentric annulets Argent. The grant is formulated to provide the College, the Boat Club, and the Oriel Society (Oriel's Alumni society) use of the badge in relation to Tortoise Club alumni activities; the Tortoise Club is not <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> incorporated entity and does not bear Arms in its own right; therefore {{it could not be}} granted such a heraldic Badge directly.|$|E
5|$|While RAD {{is likely}} to occur {{following}} neglectful and abusive childcare, {{there should be no}} automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. Experiences of abuse are associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in which the child prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds to that person in an unpredictable and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment disorganization is a risk factor but not in <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> attachment disorder. Further although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring <b>itself.</b> <b>An</b> important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E

5|$|Just to {{the south}} of the castle is the {{restored}} 18th-century castle watermill. In 2010 the castle received 128,242 visitors. Dunster Castle has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument. The castle has required continuing maintenance work, in particular to its roof, <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> important historical feature. Efforts have been made to gradually redecorate the castle in a period style, using reproductions of original wallpapers and materials. The National Trust installed solar panels behind the battlements on the roof in 2008 to provide electricity and make the premises more environmentally friendly. This {{was the first time the}} National Trust have taken this approach to a Grade I listed building, and it is expected to save 1,714kg (3,778lb) of carbon a year. In 2015, the National Trust announced plans to make the 19th-century reservoir open to the public.|$|E

5|$|Skyscrapers {{continued}} to spread both across the U.S. and internationally. New York and Chicago remained {{the center of}} skyscraper development, but most major cities in the U.S. had built skyscrapers by 1929, frequently {{as a result of}} competition between rival cities for status and investment. Cincinnati built the Cincinnati Towers in 1914, followed by the Carew Tower Complex in 1930. In Detroit, the General Motors Building opened in 1920 and the Fisher Building in 1928. Cleveland acquired the Union Trust Building in 1923 and the Terminal Tower in 1929; the latter, built by the Van Sweringen brothers, was, for a short period, the second tallest building in the world. Seattle had built Smith Tower in 1914, and the Los Angeles local government granted <b>itself</b> <b>an</b> exemption from city planning restrictions in order to build the Los Angeles City Hall in 1928. In 1928, the Industrial Trust Tower was built in Providence.|$|E

5|$|Old Trafford {{celebrated its}} 100th anniversary on 19 February 2010. In {{recognition}} of the occasion, Manchester United's official website ran a feature in which a memorable moment from the stadium's history was highlighted {{on each of the}} 100 {{days leading up to the}} anniversary. From these 100 moments, the top 10 were chosen by a panel including club statistician Cliff Butler, journalist David Meek, and former players Pat Crerand and Wilf McGuinness. At Old Trafford <b>itself,</b> <b>an</b> art competition was run for pupils from three local schools to create their own depictions of the stadium in the past, present and future. Winning paintings were put on permanent display on the concourse of the Old Trafford family stand, and the winners were presented with awards by artist Harold Riley on 22 February. An exhibition about the stadium at the club museum was opened by former goalkeeper Jack Crompton and chief executive David Gill on 19 February. The exhibition highlighted the history of the stadium and features memorabilia from its past, including a programme from the inaugural match and a 1:220 scale model hand-built by model artist Peter Oldfield-Edwards. Finally, at Manchester United's home match against Fulham on 14 March, fans at the game received a replica copy of the programme from the first Old Trafford match, and half-time saw relatives of the players who took part in the first game – as well as those of the club chairman John Henry Davies and stadium architect Archibald Leitch – taking part in the burial of a time capsule of Manchester United memorabilia near the centre tunnel. Only relatives of winger Billy Meredith, wing-half Dick Duckworth and club secretary Ernest Mangnall could not be found.|$|E
