5|$|From 1927, {{the first}} pure through-passenger trains started {{operating}} in the summer, towards Sweden {{in the morning and}} back during the <b>evening.</b> <b>From</b> 1933 it operated all year. Through the 1920s and 1930s, many shorter distances received extra trains, and passenger and freight trains were gradually separated into separate trains. The traffic through Trondheim–Hell increased; commuter trains terminated at several different stations. From 1930, multiple units were also put into use on the line.|$|E
5|$|Swift's Blue Line runs at a headway of 12 {{minutes from}} 6:00a.m. to 7:00pm on weekdays, {{its highest level}} of service with five buses per hour per direction. Weekday service begins with a headway of 20 minutes from 5:00a.m. to 6:00am, and ends with the same {{frequency}} during the <b>evening</b> <b>from</b> 7:00p.m. to 10:00pm. During Saturdays, buses run every 20 minutes from 6:00a.m. to 10:00pm. Sunday service, which was suspended from 2010 until 2015, runs from 7:00a.m. to 8:20pm every 20 minutes. The Blue Line initially ran at a 10-minute headway, and had evening service end at midnight, until a major system-wide service reduction in February 2012 reduced its weekday headway to the current 12 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The 6S {{units were}} {{intended}} to be introduced into service in June 1957. On 5April a fire at Cannon Street signal box disabled all signalling equipment there. As a result, locomotive-hauled trains were banned from the station. A temporary signal box was commissioned on 5May and the 6S units were introduced on peak services the next day. Two units coupled together formed the 06:58 and 07:26 Hastings–Cannon Street services in the morning, and the 17:18 and 18:03 Cannon Street–Hastings services in the <b>evening.</b> <b>From</b> 17June the 6S and 6L units were working services throughout the day. The 6B units entered service between May and August 1958.|$|E

5|$|The German {{invasion}} of France through the Netherlands and Belgium began on 10 May 1940. Army Group A fought {{its way through}} southern Belgium and north-eastern France. German forces pushed the French Army and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to the Meuse river on 12 May, crossing it that <b>evening.</b> <b>From</b> there, the German forces rapidly advanced to the English Channel {{over the course of}} the next week. BEF units, including detached companies of the Royal Norfolks and Royal Scots, were ordered to try to slow the German advance in northern France to buy time to evacuate troops at Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|When {{the order}} to {{withdraw}} from the field came later that <b>evening</b> <b>from</b> General McDowell, the 11th New York served as a rearguard. It was during this retreat that the regiment saw its heaviest casualties. Although accounts of the battle differ, most sources list 177 men lost at Bull Run, with 35 men killed, 74 wounded, and another 68 missing and presumed captured. Those that were taken prisoner were initially confined in Richmond. In September, they were transferred to Castle Pinckney, South Carolina, where they remained until they were paroled the following May.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's South Branch line to Romney in the 1880s, a {{passenger}} train conducted three trips daily (morning, noon, and <b>evening)</b> <b>from</b> the Romney Depot at Valley to Green Spring on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's main line. During the 1930s, passenger ridership on the South Branch line began to decline, and passenger service was finally discontinued shortly thereafter. A special passenger train carried students of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, arriving at Romney Depot in Valley in the fall, and departing in the spring to take the students home. The last special train to transport the students of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind departed Romney Depot in the spring of 1941. Freight operations from Romney Depot later ceased, and the station was closed and demolished soon after.|$|E

5|$|The {{influence}} of US pop forms has been strong {{since the end}} of World War II. Lavish Broadway-show numbers, big bands, rock and roll, and hip hop continue to be popular. Latin music, especially Brazilian bossa nova, is also popular, and the Puerto Rican genre of reggaeton is rapidly becoming a mainstream form of dance music. It is now not uncommon for modern Italian pop artists such as Laura Pausini, Eros Ramazzotti, Zucchero or Andrea Bocelli to release new songs in English or Spanish in addition to, or instead of, Italian. Thus, musical revues, which are standard fare on current Italian television, can easily go, in a single <b>evening,</b> <b>from</b> a big-band number with dancers to an Elvis impersonator to a current pop singer doing a rendition of a Puccini aria.|$|E
