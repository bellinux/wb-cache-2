The implementation of gender mainstreaming over the last ten years enables identification of the key factors required if horizontal European policies are to succeed. The experience of gender mainstreaming shows in particular that, in order to develop its full potential, the new <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Clause</b> will require firm commitment on the part of all European actors involved in the fields of employment, social protection, the fight against social exclusion, education and training and human health.

Women rights violations persist. In recent years, there has been an increasing number of <b>social</b> <b>clauses</b> in trade regimes to address poor working conditions in developing countries. Generalized Systems of Preferences (GSPs) are the prominent among unilateral mechanisms. This paper analyzes the <b>social</b> <b>clauses</b> contained in the EU and US GSPs with a view to the question whether they are adequate means of tackling poor working conditions and advancing the cause of women.

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>social</b> capital had different associations with dental status of elderly Japanese. In this cross-sectional study, self-administered questionnaires were mailed to elderly individuals living in 25 Japanese communities in 2003. Data from 5560 respondents (49. 9 %, 72. 9 Â Â±Â  6. 0 years) included information on social capital, numbers of remaining teeth, health behaviors, physical and mental health, and socioeconomic status. Vertical social capital was defined as participating in groups which encouraged hierarchical relations and <b>horizontal</b> <b>social</b> capital as participating in groups of equals. A multilevel logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between social capital and number of remaining teeth (= 20 teeth). The prevalence of people with 19 or less teeth was 70. 7 %. Univariate analysis showed significant beneficial associations between individual <b>horizontal</b> <b>social</b> capital and number of remaining teeth.

40|$|International labour {{standards}} can be promoted in different fora and in various ways. The {{aim of this}} report is to survey in wich international fora the need of international {{labour standards}} has been discussed and wich results the debate has yielded {{in the form of}} proposed or adopted conventions and other legal acts. First of all we find international labour standards in from of conventions and recommendations from the ILO. The ILO has been quite successful in working out internationally accepted labour standards, but there are no effective sanctions connected to the standards. This {{is one of the reasons}} that the possibility of including <b>social</b> <b>clauses</b> in trade agreements are discussed. By a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> the parties promise to comply with certain labour standards or run the risk of beeing confronted with trade barriers.  Social clauses has been discussed in connection with the ITO, GATT, WTO, but so far no <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> has been included in the agreements. On the other hand we find <b>social</b> <b>clauses</b> in NAFTA and in different bilateral trade agreements and unilateral trade agreements. A different approach to promote labour standards is through consumer or trade union boycotts, voluntary codes of conducts or through systems of labelling. In the review of proposed or adopted legal acts we mainly raise questions on how the international labour standards are adopted (for instance uni-, bi- or multilateral), on wich labour standards do the legal acts cover, how is the observance of the acts organized (review, supervision etc.) and wich santions do the acts provide...|$|R
40|$|Competition between {{countries}} has rapidly {{increased in the}} current context of economic globalization. Both indirect competition (through trade) and direct competition (through illegal immigration) can breed social dumping, exerting downward pressure on labor conditions in developed countries. In this paper we show {{the need for a}} <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in order to prevent firms from illegally obtaining a comparative advantage. The adoption of a <b>social</b> <b>clause,</b> based on agreed labour rights by all signatories to ILO Conventions and on the compliance by multinationals, would eliminate social dumping. Linking labor standards and trade at the multilateral level has received a lot of criticism. Some claim that this is just another strategy to masquerade the protectionist ambitions of developed countries. We believe that it should be adopted at the multilateral level in order to favor an ethical behavior in both trade and investment. This is particularly crucial for less developed countries that have inserted themselves in the international economy. A balanced analysis of the arguments in favor and against the adoption of a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> reveals that there is a patent need for an international harmonization of workers' rights regardless of the instruments. ...|$|R
40|$|Trade and labour standards: Child labour. This report, {{commissioned}} by Save the Children, Norway, discusses the main economic arguments {{for and against}} the incorporation of a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in World Trade Organization (WTO). Part one presents a historical review of how the question has been addressed in ILO and WTO, and {{the positions of the}} main actors involved are stated. ILO is generally disinclined to imposing trade sanctions against countries not fulfilling their obligations in terms of ILO regulations, and the ILO Convention 138 on Minimum Age is not included in ILO's core labour standards. The second part of the report analyses the main arguments in favour of including a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in WTO. It is argued that international coordination of labour standards, in contrast to their harmonisation, may improve welfare in developing countries. However, trade sanctions against countries violating the rules will probably not be credible since such sanctions would most likely damage the target group as well as the legitimacy of WTO. Without the credible enforcement of the rules, a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> would most likely be merely symbolic. The report argues that it would probably be more efficient to strengthen ILO...|$|R
40|$|The Authors are {{grateful}} to Heinz Hauser and participants of a doctoral workshop at the World Trade Institute The integration of core labour standards into the WTO has been demanded mostly on either humanitarian or fair trade grounds. While both reasons can be justified theoretically, the case for integration remains unclear. Whereas the humanitarian integration of core labour standards {{is a question of}} means, the fair trade reasoning is a question of empirical relevance. This paper contributes to both questions by estimating the effects of a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in a standard computable general equilibrium model of world trade (GTAP). Our finding is that developed countries have little incentive for protectionist misuse of a <b>social</b> <b>clause,</b> since humanitarian trade sanctions hardly reduce their import pressure. Furthermore, even a drastic reduction of child labour in developing countries only has a marginal effect on north-south trade flows. Therefore, calls for a better enforcement of labour standards in the south to correct vertical distribution effects of world trade in the north are not supported by our findings. However, in light of possible trade liberalization-enhancing effects and only a limited danger of protectionist misuse, a multilateral humanitarian <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> could be a...|$|R

40|$|An {{agreement}} on {{the inclusion of a}} <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in the World Trade Organization‟s (WTO) multilateral trade agreements largely depends on reassuring objecting member states that such inclusion will contribute to an improved recognition of core labour standards in trade, without altering the competitive advantage of one trading partner over another. Reassurance must be given to the effect that incorporating a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in the WTO legal framework would not be used as a trade restricting mechanism which might have direct, negative effects on the development of countries worldwide. Such an argument may not be won easily from a legal and economic perspective. There is an omnipresent conflict at the international level between the basic values underlying multilateral trade agreements and principles governing the protection of core labour standards. On the one hand, supporting the stance of free trade is the fundamental force of profit maximization while on the other hand, and in direct opposition to this market driven value system, are human rights-based calls for recognising core labour standards in employment matters related to trade. Increased international trade is a powerful tool for tackling poverty and social misery worldwide. It could thus be important to adopt a legal framework in the multilateral trade system to harness potential opportunities a trade-labour linkage could provide. In that case, the legal questions of whether or not there should be a tradeoff between the right to trade and compliance with core labour standards and whether a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in the WTO would achieve this purpose had to be addressed. However, without a compatible underpinning legal framework of universally accepted trade-labour standards, incorporating a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in the WTO would be a misplaced legal objective which is unachievable as it could lead to a conflict between the WTO and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and at most could create a legal fiction whose results may not be positively measurable. Setting two international legal norms at conflict with each other is systematically studied as a conflict in which the values of the global market economy are in a supposed confrontation with those protecting core labour standards as human rights. Therefore, this study undertook a contemporary legal analysis of the possibilities and challenges of incorporating a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in the WTO for purposes of entrenching the protection of core labour standards. It put forward arguments and tentative proposals for a trade-labour linkage legal framework which could dispel calls for excluding a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in the WTO...|$|R

The analysis suggests that the ILO’s shift to ‘promotional principles’ and the formal acceptance of voluntary self-regulation from the late- 1990 s has not significantly improved the situation for workers, but was a pragmatic response driven in part by US policy and the increasing marginalization of the ILO within the global system of economic governance.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which international trade law can serve as a means to enforce workers' rights in developing countries, considered from a human rights point of view. The first chapter {{examines the}} protection of the most important workers rights under international law. The basic problem in this protection is that workers' rights are limited in their enforcement. Therefore, international trade measures could be used to enforce these rights. A first way to use international trade law for the enforcement of workers' rights is by unilaterally imposing a set of workers' rights in the trade relations between two countries. This is the topic of the second chapter. These measures are used in both the United States and the European Community. Unilateral trade measures can be distinguished as non-reciprocal trade aid programs and reciprocal trade relations, the former being much less controversial that the latter from an international law point view. In the third chapter, multilateral trade measures, the second way to use international trade measures, are discussed. This discussion focuses on the <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade context and similar regimes. This study will demonstrate the position that a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> is to be favoured, but only as an additional way to enforce workers' rights, and only if changes to the existing procedures are made. The thesis concludes by calling for a social dimension in international trade regulation, but warns that a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in a multilateral trade agreement should be approached with realism and prudence...|$|R
