Wearing a lace-edged {{petticoat}} and bed-jacket, she looked particularly pale in the bright firelight. Her jacket had slipped from one shoulder which showed pink through the locks of <b>her</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
500|$|Keable {{remained}} in Tahiti, his health worsening. He suffered weight loss, diabetes, {{high blood pressure}} and fever, all stemming from a kidney illness. Nonetheless, he completed the novel Numerous Treasure, which he had begun before Buck's death; the bittersweet tale of a Polynesian woman who shared her name with a cocktail and a brand of cigarettes was a commercial success, and has been considered a valuable portrait of early-century Tahitian life. His health and spirits rallied in the years after Buck's death: he completed a travel book, Tahiti, Isle of Dreams, and a book tour of the United States and Europe. On returning to Tahiti he struck up a relationship with a mixed-race islander named Ina, and made many new friends including the writers Alec Waugh (elder brother of Evelyn), who had been inspired to visit Tahiti by Numerous Treasure, Zane Grey, and James Norman Hall. Waugh described the Keable of this period [...] "reclined among cushions, clad only in a pareo, while his Tahitian princess, bare-shouldered and bare-footed, <b>her</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> falling to her waist and a white flower behind her ear, glided negligently about the house" [...] – and yet noted that, on suggesting a cup of tea, Keable's voice still took on [...] "the parsonical intonation with which fifteen years earlier he had summoned the parish children to a Sunday school treat." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 10, 2013, two {{snippets of}} the song leaked online. Gaga urged fans to [...] "please take these down as much as possible" [...] and {{provided}} {{instructions on how to}} report information regarding the unauthorized distribution of her song to her label's parent company, Universal Music Group. In response, fans reported websites seen distributing or linking to the snippets of the single, with nearly 2,500 individuals sending a singular link to Universal's takedown page. However, despite such efforts, a leak was eminent. So Gaga released the song a week early onto various radio stations across America. The single was made available in most countries just before midnight (EST) on the iTunes Store, coupled with a pre-order of Artpop. Following day, Gaga was seen in goth costume with clown-like face paint similar to the [...] "Applause" [...] artwork, at various promotional events. The Huffington Post compared the style-shift to Marilyn Manson, saying: [...] "With <b>her</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> slicked back, a face full of white powder and her black blazer and shirt combo, Gaga could have easily been mistaken for Manson if it wasn't for her towering heels." [...] Gaga also premiered a short clip of [...] "Applause" [...] that quoted harsh journalism that attacked her credibility as an artist. In the video, Gaga was seen sitting naked in a white room and wearing a transparent visor. The sound of an audience booing and jeering was heard in the background. Direct quotations from critics and detractors appeared {{at the bottom of the}} video, which included: [...] "Lady Gaga is over"and [...] "Do not buy Lady Gaga's new single 'Applause'". The clip was construed as an attempt at reverse psychology.|$|E

2500|$|Later in his career, Smith {{wrote that}} he always {{believed}} himself {{to be the first}} person to get the name [...] "Black Dahlia" [...] into print, though he admitted he didn't come up with the nickname. [...] Smith had picked up a tip that Elizabeth Short had frequented a Long Beach drugstore. [...] Upon calling and speaking to the pharmacist, Smith was told that the kids around the soda fountain called her the Black Dahlia, on account of <b>her</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and in reference to a then current movie The Blue Dahlia. [...] In his book, Jack Smith's L.A., he described the discovery of the nickname as [...] "a rewrite man's dream" [...] and said he [...] "couldn't wait to get it into type." ...|$|E
