5|$|On a computer, if {{the result}} of an {{addition}} is too large to store, an arithmetic overflow occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a fairly common cause of program errors. Such overflow bugs may be hard to discover and diagnose because they may manifest themselves only for very large <b>input</b> <b>data</b> sets, which {{are less likely to be}} used in validation tests. One especially notable such error was the Y2K bug, where overflow errors due to using a 2-digit format for years caused significant computer problems in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The BTO {{analysis}} {{was able to}} determine {{the distance between the}} satellite and aircraft with a relatively high degree of accuracy, while the BFO {{analysis was}} able to estimate the heading and speed of the aircraft, but is sensitive to small changes in <b>input</b> <b>data.</b> To determine the final location of Flight 370, the BTO and BFO analyses were considered in combination with aircraft performance limitations, such as altitude, airspeed, and wind. The BFO analysis was able to isolate the Doppler shift between the aircraft and determine the relative motion of the aircraft to the satellite, which is reduced by the limited range of speeds at which the aircraft can fly and thus a limited set of speed/direction combinations exist that correlate with the calculated Doppler shifts.|$|E
