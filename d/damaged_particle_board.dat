30|$|Rice hull is a {{by-product}} of the rice polishing process and consists of 30 – 40 % carbon and 20 – 30 % silica (SiO 2). Annual global rice production is 620 million tons, of which 77 % is cultivated in Asia and 7.3 million tons are produced in Korea. It is generally recognized that the rice hull comprises 16 – 18 % of the total rice weight. Reuse of rice hull is uncommon for several reasons including its coarse appearance, low apparent density, low nutritive content, strong decay resistance, and high ash content. The use of rice hull fiber as a raw material in wood-based boards could contribute to lower utilization of raw wood material and help to reduce environmental <b>damage.</b> However, <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> comprising only rice hull {{have been shown to}} posses 1 / 3 the strength of wood-based <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> due to its porous structure and low bonding strength. Despite many difficulties associated with using rice hull in construction materials, many researchers have attempted various methods for developing rice hull-based <b>particle</b> <b>board.</b> Prior research has examined various manufacturing conditions in an attempt to optimize the manufacturing process and to improve the mechanical properties of rice hull-based boards [2, 4, 7, 8, 10].|$|R

The preliminary test was done to know the density of teak and sengon wood. This study used teak and sengon wood particles with 10 % by weight of particle urea formaldehyde adhesive UA- 147. This study was arranged in the completely randomised design with factorial experiment. The factors in this experiment were compaction ratio and wood species, while the parameters which observed were density, water content, water absorption, thickness swelling, internal bonding, hardness, MOE, and MOR. The research result showed that the higher compaction ratio, the higher density, internal bonding, hardness, MOR and MOE of both species <b>particle</b> <b>board,</b> the higher thickness swelling, and the lower water absorption of sengon <b>particle</b> <b>board.</b> The highest average density of the teak <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> was 0, 80 g/cm 3 (J 1 K 3) and 0, 67 g/cm 3 for sengon (J 2 K 6).
