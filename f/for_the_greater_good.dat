5|$|Introduced as Billie Jenkins's long-lost sister, she {{secretly}} collaborates {{with the}} demonic council {{known as the}} Triad with their plans to destroy the Charmed Ones. She eventually convinces Billie that the Charmed Ones are corrupt, and use their power to fulfill their own personal desires, rather than help <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> <b>good.</b> Billie kills Christy in self-defense after being unable to convince her to understand the Halliwell sisters were good, and to return home with her. Throughout season eight, Christy is {{shown to be a}} powerful witch with a mastery of her powers of telepathy and pyrokinesis. She is also called the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her connection with Billie, who is prophesied to be the Ultimate Power. Christy is referenced in canonical Charmed material such as comic books and novels.|$|E

Weed was an influential editor, and Fillmore tended to cooperate with him <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> <b>good</b> of the Whig Party.

5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> <b>good.</b> He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.|$|E

Davis left the show {{at the end of the}} fourth season, and was replaced by Peter Bryant. A few months later, Lloyd left the show and Bryant was promoted to producer.

25|$|Mercurial, clever, {{and always}} {{a few steps}} ahead of his enemies, at times {{he could be a}} calculating schemer who would not only {{manipulate}} people <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> <b>good</b> but act like a bumbling fool to have others underestimate his true abilities. Sometimes this appears simply as a joke, such as in The Tomb of the Cybermen, where he finishes the archaeologists' calculations behind their backs, but at other times, it seems much darker. In The Evil of the Daleks he coldly manipulates Jamie into trying to rescue Victoria (thus setting in motion the Human Factor tests) and is unsympathetic when Edward Waterfield tries to apologise for his collaboration with the Daleks. Despite the bluster and tendency to panic when events got out of control, the Second Doctor always acted heroically and morally in his desire to help the oppressed.|$|E

In season eight, Chloe discovers that she also has super-intelligence – being able to solve complex algorithms faster than LuthorCorp's most powerful supercomputer.

500|$|Just {{like his}} comic book counterpart, Smallvilles Clark Kent was a {{symbolic}} representation of Jesus Christ.

[...] Echoing Owen, Judge Byun identified the same symbolism: [...] "Superman is, in a way, the secular pop culture stand-in for Jesus Christ, a messiah figure for our generation. The series makes this theme explicit in its pilot episode, in which Clark is symbolically 'crucified' in a cornfield. That striking bit of symbolism becomes the central preoccupation of the series; Clark is the savior who sacrifices all <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> <b>good</b> of humanity, and Smallville shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that role." ...|$|E

Banerjea argues during the film, the moral boundary between legality and criminality gradually erodes. Film scholar Wimal Dissanayake agrees that the film brought [...] "a new stage in the evolving dialectic between violence and social order" [...] to Indian cinema. Film scholar M. Madhava Prasad states that Jai and Veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society. Prasad says that, through the elements of revenge included in the plot {{and the application of}} Jai and Veeru's criminality <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> <b>good,</b> the narrative reflects reactionary politics, and the audience is compelled to accept feudal order. Banerjea explains that though Jai and Veeru are mercenaries, they are humanised by their emotional needs. Such dualism makes them vulnerable, in contrast to the pure evil of Gabbar Singh.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Tim Minear and [...] Vince Gilligan, and {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. Minear's original idea for the episode involved a convicted criminal {{who happened to be}} an atheist. While in prison, he would have heard the voice of God, commanding him to kill a truly evil man, and then he would have suddenly found himself mystically transferred out of the prison. Although the police would be after him, only Mulder would believe he was working <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> <b>good.</b> Minear noted that [...] "I pitched it and I was going to do it, eventually, until we found ourselves at a point in the year where we needed a script really fast." [...] Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Minear that the [...] "convicted atheist" [...] should actually be Robert Modell from the third season episode [...] "Pusher".

500|$|In {{his book}} Playing War: Military Video Games After 9/11, Matthew Payne {{analyzed}} three controversial levels from the Call of Duty series, including [...] "No Russian".

Payne also commented that while [...] "No Russian" [...] could be seen as a realistic depiction of war when compared to contemporary representations, it could only be viewed {{in the context of the}} story, and thus removes any potential of having the player reexamine the precepts of modern warfare. Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, Robert Rath of Zam.com replayed [...] "No Russian" [...] and examined how the level mirrored real life terrorist attacks.
