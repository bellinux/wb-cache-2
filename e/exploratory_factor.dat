40|$|AbstractThis study {{sought to}} screen the {{psychological}} profile among Heart Failure (HF) patients in Malaysia. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was administered to 211 HF patients. Later, qualitative interviews were used to gain an in-depth understanding of the prior findings. The study demonstrated that depression (6 %) and anxiety (9 %) are rare in the Malaysia HF populations. These results were explained through <b>exploratory</b> <b>factors</b> such as family support, positive thinking, and spiritual belief {{that emerged from the}} qualitative interviews. Prevalence of anxiety and depression among HF patients in Malaysia is lower compared to the Western population due to some motivating factors...|$|R
30|$|Testing the {{inventory}} with 216 Iranian EFL teachers {{indicated that there}} were high Cronbach’s alpha reliability indices for the three main perspectives and their dimensions. This implies that {{the inventory}} enjoyed appropriate internal consistency. The results of <b>exploratory</b> <b>factors</b> analysis {{indicated that there was}} no construct irrelevant factor and all the indicators were loaded in the related teacher competence and perspective dimension. Four separate structural equation models (SEM) were tested in order to probe the trait structure of the inventory. The first three SEM models targeted the three perspectives individually, while the last model explored the structure of the total data. The results indicated that all items had significant contributions to their respective dimensions.|$|R

The sample comprised of 118 individuals of 12 bat species (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Myotis mystacinus, M. alcathoe, M. brandtii, M. oxygnathus, M. myotis, Hypsugo savii, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. nathusii, Plecotus auritus, P. austriacus and Nyctalus noctula) collected from 15 sites throughout Serbia. Six digenean species were identified: Lecithodendrium linstowi, Plagiorchis sp., Prosthodendrium longiforme, P. chilostomum, P. parvouterus and Mesotretes peregrinus.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel {{concept is}} {{proposed}} where exploration, which {{is essential in}} reinforcement learning, {{is considered to be}} one aspect of the motions generated by the learner’s internal dynamics and is expected to develop through learning towards more purposeful higher dynamic functions such as “thinking”. To realize such a concept, a chaotic neural network is introduced for generating motions with <b>exploratory</b> <b>factors</b> that are derived from the internal chaotic dynamics without adding external random noises. Effective exploration is expected based on the dynamics called “chaotic itinerancy”, which is also expected to be the key to learning higher dynamic functions more easily that require both stable and transitive dynamics. This paper also proposes a reinforcement learning method without any external random noise, using the temporal difference (TD) error of the state value and the contribution trace of each input to the output increase in each neuron. It was confirmed in a simple learning task that by using a chaotic neural network, an agent could explore in accordance with the internal chaotic dynamics and could learn goal-directed behaviors. The proposed framework seems promising to explain the emergence of higher intelligence in real lives and also to develop human-like intelligence though there are many remaining problems to be solved.
