25|$|It is {{believed}} that FHM mutations lead to migraine susceptibility by lowering the threshold for cortical-spreading-depression generation. The FHM1 and FHM3 mutations occur in ion channels expressed in neurons. These mutations may lead to both the hyper and hypoexcitable neurons that might underlie cortical-spreading-depression. It is even less clear how the mutations seen in FHM2 patients might lead to FHM symptoms as the gene mutated in FHM2 is expressed primarily in astrocytes. One proposal states that the depolarization of astrocytes caused by <b>haploinsufficiency</b> <b>of</b> the ATP1A2 /-ATPase causes increased release of compounds such as adenosine from astrocytes. These compounds then interact with neighboring neurons, altering their excitability and leading to cortical-spreading-depression and migraine.|$|E

However, the inheritance pattern of PRPF31 mutations is atypical of dominant inheritance, showing the phenomenon of partial penetrance, whereby a dominant mutations appear to [...] "skip" [...] generations.

40|$|Haploinsufficiency {{is defined}} as a {{dominant}} phenotype in diploid organisms that are heterozygous for a loss-of-function allele. Despite its relevance to human disease, neither the extent <b>of</b> <b>haploinsufficiency</b> nor its precise molecular mechanisms are well understood. We used the complete set of Saccharomyces cerevisiae heterozygous deletion strains to survey the genome for haploinsufficiency via fitness profiling in rich (YPD) and minimal media to identify all genes that confer a haploinsufficient growth defect.

This mouse model of 4 NQO carcinogenesis demonstrated that despite the same tumor frequency, XPA−/−p 53 +/− mice reached 100 % SCC incidence at 25 weeks compared with 50 weeks for XPA−/−p 53 +/+ littermates. XPA−/−p 53 −/− mice succumbed to spontaneous thymic lymphomas before the development of tongue tumors (before 13 weeks of age). SCC originated in XPA−/−p 53 +/− mice maintained the p 53 +/− genotype and the retained wild-type p 53 allele appeared to be structurally intact. Only one of 20 XPA−/−p 53 +/+ SCC showed a missense mutation of p 53.

50|$|TCOF1 {{is found}} on the 5th {{chromosome}} in the 5q32 region. It codes for a relatively simple nucleolar protein called treacle, that {{is thought to be}} involved in ribosome assembly. Mutations in TCOF1 lead to <b>haploinsufficiency</b> <b>of</b> the treacle protein. Haploinsufficiency occurs when a diploid organism has only one functional copy of a gene, because the other copy is inactivated by a mutation.

50|$|This gene encodes {{a member}} of the muscle segment {{homeobox}} gene family. The encoded protein functions as a transcriptional repressor during embryogenesis through interactions with components of the core transcription complex and other homeoproteins. It may also have roles in limb-pattern formation, craniofacial development, in particular, odontogenesis, and tumor growth inhibition. There is also strong evidence from sequencing studies of candidate genes involved in clefting that mutations in the MSX1 gene may be associated in the pathogenesis of cleft lip and palate. Mutations in this gene, which was once known as homeobox 7, have also been associated with Witkop syndrome, Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, and autosomal dominant hypodontia. <b>Haploinsufficiency</b> <b>of</b> MSX1 protein affects the development of all teeth, preferentially third molars and second premolars.

We ameliorated the L-LTP deficit in two ways: (1) by enhancing the expression of CREB-dependent genes, and (2) by inhibiting histone deacetyltransferase activity (HDAC), the molecular counterpart of the histone acetylation function of CBP. Inhibition of HDAC also reversed the memory defect observed in fear conditioning. These findings suggest {{that some of the}} cognitive and physiological deficits observed on RTS are not simply due to the reduction of CBP during development but may also result from the continued requirement throughout life for both the CREB co-activation and the histone acetylation function of CBP...|$|R
40|$|The p 53 tumor {{suppressor}} {{protein is}} a sequence-specific transcriptional activator of target genes. Exposure of cells to DNA damage results in accumulation of biochemically active p 53, with consequent activation of p 53 -responsive promoters. In order {{to study how}} the transcriptional activity of the p 53 protein is regulated in vivo, a transgenic mouse strain was generated. These mice harbor the p 53 -dependent promoter of the mdm 2 gene, fused to a lacZ reporter gene. Induction of lacZ activity by DNA damage (ionizing radiation) was monitored in embryos of different p 53 genotypes. The transgenic promoter was substantially activated in vivo following irradiation; activation required functional p 53. The activation pattern became more restricted with increasing embryo age, {{as well as with}} the state of differentiation of a given tissue. Generally, maximal p 53 activation occurred in rapidly proliferating, relatively less differentiated cells. A striking extent <b>of</b> <b>haploinsufficiency</b> was revealed-induction <b>of</b> promoter activity was far less efficient in mice carrying only one wild-type p 53 allele. This suggests that normal levels of cellular p 53 are limiting, and any further reduction already compromises the p 53 response significantly. Thus, the activation potential of p 53 is tightly controlled in vivo, both spatially and temporally, and an important element in this control is the presence of limiting basal levels of activatable p 53...|$|R

40|$|Haploinsufficiency, wherein {{a single}} {{functional}} {{copy of a}} gene is insufficient to maintain normal function, is {{a major cause of}} dominant disease. Human disease studies have identified several hundred haploinsufficient (HI) genes. We have compiled a map of 1, 079 haplosufficient (HS) genes by systematic identification of genes unambiguously and repeatedly compromised by copy number variation among 8, 458 apparently healthy individuals and contrasted the genomic, evolutionary, functional, and network properties between these HS genes and known HI genes. We found that HI genes are typically longer and have more conserved coding sequences and promoters than HS genes. HI genes exhibit higher levels of expression during early development and greater tissue specificity. Moreover, within a probabilistic human functional interaction network HI genes have more interaction partners and greater network proximity to other known HI genes. We built a predictive model {{on the basis of these}} differences and annotated 12, 443 genes with their predicted probability of being haploinsufficient. We validated these predictions <b>of</b> <b>haploinsufficiency</b> by demonstrating that genes with a high predicted probability <b>of</b> exhibiting <b>haploinsufficiency</b> are enriched among genes implicated in human dominant diseases and among genes causing abnormal phenotypes in heterozygous knockout mice.

Neuronal specific down-regulation of DmLETM 1 results in impairment of locomotor behavior in the fly and reduced synaptic neurotransmitter release.
