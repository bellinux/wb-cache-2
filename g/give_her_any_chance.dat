60|$|Roswell Gardiner {{stood on}} his own quarter-deck, anxiously {{watching}} the drift of the other schooner, as she drew near in her laboured way, struggling ahead through billows that were almost as white as the breakers that menaced them with destruction to leeward. The anchored vessel, though drifting, had so slow a movement that it served to mark the steady and rapid set of its consort towards its certain fate. At first, it seemed to Gardiner that Daggett would pass just ahead of him, and he trembled for his cables, which occasionally appeared above water, stretched like bars of iron, for the distance of thirty or forty fathoms. But, the leeward set of the vessel under way was too fast to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of bringing this new danger on her consort. When a cable's length distant, the Sea Lion, of the Vineyard, did seem {{as if she might}} weather her consort; but, ere that short space was passed over, it was found that she fell off so fast, by means of her drift, as to carry her fairly clear of her stern. The two masters, holding with one hand to some permanent object by which to steady themselves, and each pressing his tarpaulin firmly down on his head with the other, had a minute's conversation when the schooners were nearest together.|$|E
60|$|But Elinor {{would not}} <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> {{encouragement}} {{to hope that}} she SHOULD tell her sister. Lucy continued.|$|R
6000|$|... "I would," [...] said Mrs. Easterfield, but her {{expression}} {{did not indicate}} that she expected Olive's announcement to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> pleasure.|$|R
60|$|I began married life, {{and carried}} it on without <b>giving</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> {{conception}} {{of the state of}} my finances. She had an allowance from the first.|$|R
6000|$|... "This tallies {{with what}} Alice hinted," [...] said Everard; [...] "but {{how could she}} know it? didst thou <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> hint of such a thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so, mother?" [...] he said, enraptured with the notion. [...] "I've done my best--or my worst--not to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> {{reason to be}} so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She had {{not much}} {{in life to}} <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> very special courage for it, or any great {{confidence}} in mankind. That's very true. But this seems an exaggeration." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{that touch}} {{of her old}} self, Winton smiled. She should do everything, pay for everything, bring a whole street of {{children}} down, if it would <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> comfort! ...|$|R
500|$|She {{could not}} {{understand}} why Hitler, if he felt so strongly, had not <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> indication of his attachment, saying, [...] "Hitler would hardly have suffered from too much shyness".|$|R
50|$|In 1995, she {{participated in}} the Russian {{legislative}} election {{at the head of}} the Juna Davitashvili Bloc. Her 0.47% of votes were not enough to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> seat in the State Duma.|$|R
5000|$|Debbie is {{a little}} girl starved for {{attention}} because her parents are always fighting; her mother yells at her constantly, and her father is too lazy to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> quality time. Debbie <b>gives</b> <b>her</b> parents an invitation she received that says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{is all the}} cat's fault,' replied Udea. 'She put out my fire so that I {{could not}} cook. All about a bean! I ate one and forgot to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{means that}} you won't <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> more, even though you may have some for yourselves? You are even bigger brutes than I took you to be," [...] {{concluded}} the elder Rover boy bitterly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{noticed that}} you didn't <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> {{invitation}} to call when she invited you," [...] went on Dave, after a pause, {{during which they}} left {{the vicinity of the}} shore and swept out into Mirror Lake.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, really. If he <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> he lost it all; the {{old lady}} said so. Now what do you think?" [...] asked Aunt Kipp, who found it {{impossible}} to pardon Polly,--perhaps because she was young, and pretty, and much beloved.|$|R
25|$|Count Ayakura is {{strongly}} tempted to punish Tadeshina, {{but she knows}} too much about his secret resentment of the upstart Matsugaes, and he cannot afford to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> encouragement to reveal itin particular, the instruction he <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> (in 1905) that Satoko should lose <b>her</b> virginity before <b>any</b> bridegroom chosen by the Marquis should touch her.|$|R
50|$|The singer {{stated that}} she was told that Kuwaiti {{officials}} had ordered for <b>her</b> ban without <b>giving</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> justifications. Hijazi noted that she will not let the matter be until {{she is able to}} find out the real reasons behind her ban.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{mother is}} angry with me," [...] said Louise, misconstruing the {{connexion}} of the parties. [...] "I will not remain to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> offence. If {{there is a}} stable or a cowhouse, an empty stall will be bed enough for Charlot and me." ...|$|R
60|$|Fitzpiers {{feared that}} she might not be coming to him even now, and hastily quitting the room, he ran down the path to meet her. The nature of her errand he could not divine, but he was {{prepared}} to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> amount of encouragement.|$|R
6000|$|After {{wandering}} on {{for some}} time, she was alarmed by the apparition of a tall man, armed, who suddenly appeared in the pathway at a short distance before her. She {{had no doubt that}} this was another robber. It was too late for her to attempt to fly from him. He was too near to allow <b>her</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of escape. In this extremity, she conceived the idea of throwing herself upon his generosity as her last and only hope. So she advanced boldly toward him, leading the little prince by the hand, and said to him, presenting the prince, ...|$|R
50|$|Betty has second {{thoughts}} {{and tries to}} make up with her husband, but he refuses {{to go home with}} her. Out of anger, she destroys his new kite. Aghast, Herbert angrily refuses to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> further financial support and is put in prison as a result.|$|R
60|$|Alice {{said nothing}} for a few moments, but he thought she grasped the {{significance}} of his hint {{that he was willing}} to spoil the plans of Carmen's friends. He did not know if this <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> satisfaction, but did not expect her to show her feelings.|$|R
6000|$|... "I never <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> {{other cause}} of dislike, my lord," [...] replied Varney. [...] "But {{she knew that}} my counsels went {{directly}} to diminish her influence with your lordship; and that I was, and have been, ever ready to peril my life against your enemies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O no, Peony!" [...] {{answered}} Violet, with grave wisdom. [...] "That {{will not}} do at all. Warm milk will not be wholesome for our little snow-sister. Little snow-people, like her, eat nothing but icicles. No, no, Peony; we must not <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> thing warm to drink!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I {{should talk}} this way." [...] Her friend was {{apparently}} not prepared with an assent, and she quickly enough pursued: [...] "If he HAD <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> {{it would come}} out somehow in her expenditure. She has tremendous liberty and is very secretive, but still it would come out." ...|$|R
6000|$|She answered: [...] "Be {{careful what}} {{you say to that}} woman. I don't want <b>her</b> here by <b>any</b> <b>chance.</b> The young ones were quite bad enough." ...|$|R
50|$|On 5 June 2001, Dela Cruz sued {{and asked}} for damages, {{claiming}} that after recording one album BMG never <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> proposal for a second one and that despite the lapse of the option period, the firm refused to release her {{on the ground that}} she still had to record one album.|$|R

5000|$|Stefanie {{was interviewed}} and Hitler's alleged {{love for her}} dramatised in a 1973 Austro-German {{television}} film called A Young Man From the Innviertel.She could not understand why Hitler, if he felt so strongly, had not <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> indication of his attachment, saying, [...] "Hitler would hardly have suffered from too much shyness".|$|R
60|$|Charnock was frank. He knew Sadie {{understood}} him, perhaps {{better than}} he understood himself, and if his narrative <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> pleasure, he thought she deserved it. Moreover, when he wanted he talked rather well, making his meaning clear without saying too much. When he finished {{she gave him a}} level glance.|$|R
5000|$|Romijn {{was asked}} by Elle {{magazine}} in April 2002 whether making Femme Fatale had <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> new ideas about her sexuality.

6000|$|... "In {{the marital}} duel Meg is winning. The woman {{generally}} does; {{she has the}} children on her side. I can't <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> of the real part of me, the vital part that she wants—I can't, {{any more than you}} could give kisses to a stranger. And I feel that I'm losing—and don't care." ...|$|R
50|$|In March 2005, Tobing {{terminated}} her {{contract with}} BMG Indonesia which, in September 2004, released her Idol album Terima Kasih. At her press conference, Tobing and her lawyer {{stated that the}} reason she had long been treated unfairly, BMG Indonesia had never informed her about the selling of the album and did not <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> royalties.|$|R
60|$|We {{each had}} our posts. Corny {{was to do}} the crowning, and I {{was to make the}} speech. Rectus had his place by the flag, which he was to haul up at the proper moment. Mrs. Chipperton {{undertook}} to stand by the old lady,--that is, the queen,--and <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>any</b> support she might happen to need during the ceremony.|$|R
