Pilot-scale heat transfer tests were performed to determine the relationship between flue <b>gas</b> <b>moisture</b> concentration, heat exchanger design and operating conditions, and water vapor condensation rate. The tests also determined {{the extent to which}} the condensation processes for water and acid vapors in flue gas can be made to occur separately in different heat transfer sections.

Sulfuric acid vapor condensed in both the high temperature and low temperature regions of the heat transfer apparatus, while hydrochloric and nitric acid vapors condensed with the water vapor in the low temperature region. Measurements made of flue gas mercury concentrations upstream and downstream of the heat exchangers showed a significant reduction in flue gas mercury concentration within the heat exchangers. A theoretical heat and mass transfer model was developed for predicting rates of heat transfer and water vapor condensation and comparisons were made with pilot scale measurements.

40|$|AbstractThe mineral carbonation, {{a process}} of {{converting}} CO 2 into stable minerals (mineralization), has been studied extensively to capture and store CO 2. However, most of the mineral carbonation studies have been largely investigated at lab scale. Preliminary and pilot scale studies for accelerated mineral carbonation (AMC) were conducted {{at one of the}} largest coal-fired power plants (2120  MW) in the USA by reacting flue gas with fly ash particles in a fluidized bed reactor. In the preliminary experiments, flue gas CO 2 and SO 2 concentrations decreased from 13. 0 to 9. 6 % and from 107. 8 to 15. 1  ppmv, respectively during the first 2  min. of reaction. The flue gas treatment increased mercury (Hg) concentration in fly ash (0. 1 to 0. 22  mg/kg) suggesting that fly ash particles also mineralized flue gas Hg. From these results, we designed and developed pilot scale process skid consisting — a moisture reducing drum (MRD) (0. 9 mΦ× 1. 8 m), a heater/humidifier (0. 9 mΦ× 1. 8 m), and a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) (0. 9 – 1. 2 mΦ× 3. 7 m) to capture and mineralize flue gas CO 2. Flue gas was withdrawn from the stack and was fed to the MRD at about 0. 094  m 3 /s. The MRD and the heater/humidifier pretreat flue gas before it enters the FBR. The MRD captures droplets of water entrained in the flue gas to protect the blower placed between the MRD and the heater/humidifier. The heater/humidifier enables control of flue <b>gas</b> <b>moisture</b> and temperature. Approximately 100 – 300  kg of fresh fly ash was collected from the electrostatic precipitator through ash hopper and placed in the fluidized-bed reactor. The fly ash particles were fluidized by flow of flue gas through a distributor plate in the FBR. The pilot scale studies were conducted at a controlled pressure (115. 1  kPa) by controlling the flue <b>gas</b> <b>moisture</b> content. The flue gas was continuously monitored to measure flue gas CO 2, SO 2 and NOx concentrations by an industrial grade gas analyzer, while the fresh and spent fly ashes were analyzed for calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), sulfur (S), and mercury (Hg) content. The pilot scale study results suggest that an appreciable amount of flue gas CO 2 and significant amounts of SO 2 and Hg can be directly captured (without separation) and mineralized by the fly ash particles...|$|E

When the Knudsen number (λ/r ratio, λ: molecular mean free path, r: pore radius) {{of a single}} gas was larger than unity, Knudsen flow became the dominant gas transportation process.

40|$|Multiple CO 2 {{capture and}} storage (CCS) {{processes}} {{are required to}} address anthropogenic CO 2 problems. However, a method which can directly capture and mineralize CO 2 at a point source, under actual field conditions, has advantages and could help offset the cost associated with the conventional CCS technologies. The mineral carbonation (MC), a process of converting CO 2 into stable minerals (mineralization), has been studied extensively to store CO 2. However, most of the MC studies have been largely investigated at laboratory scale. Objectives of this research were to develop a pilot scale AMC (accelerated mineral carbonation) process and test the effects of flue <b>gas</b> <b>moisture</b> content on carbonation of fly ash particles. A pilot scale AMC process consisting of a moisture reducing drum (MRD), a heater/humidifier, and a fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) was developed and tested by reacting flue gas with fly ash particles {{at one of the}} largest coal-fired power plants (2120 MW) in the USA. The experiments were conducted over a period of 2 hr at ~ 300 SCFM flow-rates, at a controlled pressure (115. 1 kPa), and under different flue <b>gas</b> <b>moisture</b> contents (2 - 16 %). The flue gas CO 2 and SO 2 concentrations were monitored before and during the experiments by an industrial grade gas analyzer. Fly ash samples were collected from the reactor sample port from 0 - 120 minutes and analyzed for total inorganic carbon (C), sulfur (S), and mercury (Hg). From C, S, and Hg concentrations, %calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), %sulfate (SO 42 -), and %mercury carbonate (HgCO 3) were calculated, respectively. Results suggested significant mineralization of flue gas CO 2, SO 2, and Hg within 10 - 15 minutes of reaction. Among different moisture conditions, ~ 16 % showed highest conversion of flue gas CO 2 and SO 2 to %CaCO 3 and %SO 42 - in fly ash samples. For example, an increase of almost 4 % in CaCO 3 content of fly ash was observed. Overall, the AMC process is cost-effective with minimum carbon footprint and can be retrofitted to coal fired power plants (existing and/or new) as a post-combustion unit to minimize flue gas CO 2, SO 2, and Hg emissions into the atmosphere. Used in conjunction with capture and geologic sequestration, the AMC process has the potential to reduce overall cost associated with CO 2 separation/compression/transportation/pore space/brine water treatment. It could also help protect sensitive amines and carbon filters used in flue gas CO 2 capture and separation process and extend their life...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic heat {{regenerated}} Temperature Swing Adsorption (MTSA) {{technology is}} being developed for thermal, carbon dioxide (CO 2) and humidity control for a Portable Life Support Subsystem (PLSS). Metabolically-produced CO 2 present in the ventilation gas of a PLSS is collected using a CO 2 -selective adsorbent via temperature swing adsorption. The temperature swing is initiated through cooling to well below metabolic temperatures. Cooling is achieved with a sublimation heat exchanger using water or liquid carbon dioxide (L CO 2) expanded below sublimation temperature when exposed to low pressure or vacuum. Subsequent super heated vapor, as well as additional coolant, is used to further cool the astronaut. The temperature swing on the adsorbent is then completed by warming the adsorbent with a separate condensing ice heat exchanger (CIHX) using metabolic heat from moist ventilation gas. The condensed humidity in the ventilation gas is recycled at the habitat. The water condensation from the ventilation gas represents {{a significant source of}} potential energy for the warming of the adsorbent bed as it represents as much as half of the energy potential in the moist ventilation gas.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) in insects is highly controversial. Adaptive hypotheses which have obtained experimental support include a water savings mechanism for living in dry environments (hygric hypothesis), {{a reduction in}} oxidative damage due to a high-performance oxygen delivery system (oxidative damage hypothesis), {{and the need for}} steep intratracheal partial pressure gradients to exchange gases under the hypercapnic and/or hypoxic conditions potentially encountered in subterranean environments (chthonic hypothesis). However, few experimental studies have simultaneously assessed multiple competing hypotheses within a strong inference framework. Here, we present such a study at the species level for a diapausing moth pupa, Samia cynthia. Switching gas conditions from controlled normoxic, normocapnic and intermediate humidity to either high or low oxygen, high or low moisture, elevated carbon dioxide, or some combination of these, revealed that DGE was abandoned under all conditions except high oxygen, and high or low <b>gas</b> <b>moisture</b> levels. Thus, support is found for the oxidative damage hypothesis when scored as maintenance of DGE. Modulation of DGE under either dry or hyperoxic conditions suggested strong support for the oxidative damage hypothesis and some limited support for the hygric hypothesis.

Further investigation is required using a strong-inference, experimental approach across a range of species from different habitats to determine how widespread the support for the oxidative damage hypothesis might be.

40|$|There are {{approximately}} 36, 000 glycol dehydration {{systems in the}} natural gas production sector emitting an estimated 15 Bcf of methane per year into the atmosphere. Most dehydration systems use triethylene glycol (TEG) as the absorbent fluid to remove water from natural gas. As TEG absorbs water, it also absorbs methane, other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). As TEG is regenerated through heating in a reboiler, absorbed methane, VOCs, and HAPs are vented to the atmosphere with the water, wasting gas and money. The amount of methane absorbed and vented is directly proportional to the TEG circulation rate. Many wells produce gas far below the original design capacity but continue to circulate TEG at rates {{two or three times}} higher than necessary, resulting in little improvement in <b>gas</b> <b>moisture</b> quality but much higher methane emissions and fuel use. Reducing circulation rates reduces methane emissions at negligible cost.

Economic analyses show flash tank separators installed on dehydration units payback costs in 4 to 11 months. Technology Background Many producers use triethylene glycol (TEG) in dehydrators to remove water from the natural gas stream and to meet pipeline quality standards.

40|$|Linear Alkyl benzene Sulfonic Acid (LAS) is {{the main}} {{ingredient}} of many commercial formulations for industrial and domestic synthetic detergents. The current industrial LAS production method includes sulfonation of linear alkylbenzene (LAB) with sulfur trioxide in tubular falling film reactors. In such reactors a diluted gaseous stream of SO 3 and dry air, feed gas, is contacted with liquid LAB while both reactants flow co-currently downward. The reaction is highly exothermic and product quality is primarily dependent on heat removal efficiency from the reactors, and also contact time. This research project investigates a new route {{for the production of}} LAS. This new method employs SO 2 oxidation over activated carbon at 25 oC to SO 3, followed by the extraction of the adsorbed SO 3 from the activated carbon by supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO 2). The condensed phase CO 2 -SO 3 mixture after expansion is contacted with LAB where sulfonation of this substrate occurs to yield LAS. The new route should offer lower operating temperatures and lower feed gas SO 3 concentrations in the sulfonation reaction to minimize loss of LAB to side-reactions and reduce LAS contamination (that appears as unacceptable product discoloration). The laboratory set up was designed, assembled and in total 25 experiments were carried out. Over the course of experiments a number of remedial actions were taken to improve set up functionality and reaction yield. The problems needed to be tackled included feed <b>gas</b> <b>moisture</b> removal, SO 2 /SO 3 adsorption/desorption efficiency, homogeneous mixing of reactants and reducing the SCCO 2 /SO 3 flow rate through LAB columns.

A NASA Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase 1 contract was performed to investigate condensing and icing as applied to MTSA to enable higher fidelity modeling and assess the impact of geometry variables on CIHX performance for future CIHX design optimization. Specifically, a design tool was created using analytical relations to explore the complex, interdependent design space of a condensing ice heat exchanger. Numerous variables were identified as having nontrivial contributions to performance such as hydraulic diameter, heat exchanger effectiveness, ventilation gas mass flow rate and surface roughness. Using this tool, four test articles were designed and manufactured to map to a full MTSA subassembly (the adsorbent bed, the sublimation heat exchanger for cooling and the condensing ice heat exchanger for warming). The design mapping considered impacts due to CIHX geometry as well as subassembly impacts such as thermal mass and thermal resistance through the adsorbent bed.

40|$|The Wurster bed {{process is}} {{frequently}} used for film coating. In the Wurster bed, particles circulate in {{the equipment and}} are sprayed with a liquid which forms a coating when dry. The procedure is repeated until the desired characteristics of the coating layer are obtained. The complex process involves zones of both high and low particle concentrations, as well as high and low velocities. To {{gain a better understanding}} of the mechanisms controlling the quality of the coating and how optimisation and scale-up of the process can be improved, both experimental and theoretical studies were made. To study the coating formation and investigate how the coating is affected by the spray and drying velocities, a new device for coating a single levitated particle under controlled conditions was designed and tested. The particle was levitated and droplets were sprayed from below, as in the Wurster process. Coating with a solution of HydroxyPropylCellulose (HPC) and a latex dispersion was investigated in the single particle coating device, and the influence of operating conditions was studied. Temperature, gas humidity and droplet frequency can be varied and are well defined. The experimental results show that both increased <b>gas</b> <b>moisture</b> content and increased droplet frequency give a smoother coating. The solvent in the coating liquid and the temperature also influenced the coating structure. A ring pattern was observed when the particle was coated with the dispersion. A model was developed to study the mechanism influencing the coating structure at the single particle level. Knowledge of the particle movement in the bed is needed in order to couple the single particle coating to the particle and gas dynamics in the process equipment. To study the particle movement, a laboratory Wurster bed of plexiglass, to allow optical access to the flow, was constructed. A technique was developed to track the particle in the laboratory scale bed. A small amount of particles are marked with fluorescence and the marked particles are tracked with a high-speed video camera. With this technique, particles can be followed in the zones with low particle concentration and near the walls; with image analysis, particle trajectories and velocities can be calculated. The technique can be used for the characterization of differences in process dynamics due to variation in operating conditions. The distribution of the maximum height of the particle trajectories was studied for selected parameters of particle loading, jet air velocity and position of the Wurster tube. A model of the Wurster bed coater, which combines the particle and gas dynamics with the wetting and drying, was developed. The model can be used to predict the influence of the operating conditions and geometric dimensions of the equipment. To simulate particle and gas motion, the Eulerian-Eulerian approach was used. The simulation indicates where the drying takes place in the equipment and how different process conditions influence the drying. The influence of spray rate, temperature and moisture content in the fluidised air was investigated. Results show that most of the drying takes place in the Wurster tube under typical operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{project has}} {{developed}} a nanoporous membrane based water vapor separation technology {{that can be used}} for recovering energy and water from low-temperature industrial waste gas streams with high moisture contents. This kind of exhaust stream is widely present in many industrial processes including the forest products and paper industry, food industry, chemical industry, cement industry, metal industry, and petroleum industry. The technology can recover not only the sensible heat but also high-purity water along with its considerable latent heat. Waste heats from such streams are considered very difficult to recover by conventional technology because of poor heat transfer performance of heat-exchanger type equipment at low temperature and moisture-related corrosion issues. During the one-year Concept Definition stage of the project, the goal was to prove the concept and technology in the laboratory and identify any issues that need to be addressed in future development of this technology. In this project, computational modeling and simulation have been conducted to investigate the performance of a nanoporous material based technology, transport membrane condenser (TMC), for waste heat and water recovery from low grade industrial flue gases. A series of theoretical and computational analyses have provided insight and support in advanced TMC design and experiments. Experimental study revealed condensation and convection through the porous membrane bundle was greatly improved over an impermeable tube bundle, because of the membrane capillary condensation mechanism and the continuous evacuation of the condensate film or droplets through the membrane pores. Convection Nusselt number in flue gas side for the porous membrane tube bundle is 50 % to 80 % higher than those for the impermeable stainless steel tube bundle. The condensation rates for the porous membrane tube bundle also increase 60 % to 80 %. Parametric study for the porous membrane tube bundle heat transfer performance was also done, which shows this heat transfer enhancement approach works well in a wide parameters range for typical flue gas conditions. Better understanding of condensing heat transfer mechanism for porous membrane heat transfer surfaces, shows higher condensation and heat transfer rates than non-permeable tubes, due to existence of the porous membrane walls. Laboratory testing has documented increased TMC performance with increased exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>moisture</b> content levels, which has exponentially increased potential markets for the product. The TMC technology can uniquely enhance waste heat recovery in tandem with water vapor recovery for many other industrial processes such as drying, wet and dry scrubber exhaust gases, dewatering, and water chilling. A new metallic substrate membrane tube development and molded TMC part fabrication method, provides an economical way to expand this technology for scaled up applications with less than 3 year payback expectation. A detailed market study shows a broad application area for this advanced waste heat and water recovery technology. A commercialization partner has been lined up to expand this technology to this big market. This research work led to new findings on the TMC working mechanism to improve its performance, better scale up design approaches, and economical part fabrication methods. Field evaluation work needs to be done to verify the TMC real world performance, and get acceptance from the industry, and pave the way for our commercial partner to put it into a much larger waste heat and waste water recovery market. This project is addressing the priority areas specified for DOE Industrial Technologies Program's (ITP's) : Energy Intensive Processes (EIP) Portfolio - Waste Heat Minimization and Recovery platform...|$|E

The soil's ability to retain water is strongly related to particle size; water molecules hold more tightly to the fine particles of a clay soil than to coarser particles of a sandy soil, so clays generally retain more water. Conversely, sands provide easier passage or transmission of water through the profile. Clay type, organic content, and soil structure also influence soil water retention.|$|R
