Ito and Suzuki felt that the portrayals of the Law and Chaos Heroes were <b>imbalanced,</b> with the Chaos Hero being too emotional and the Law Hero being unsympathetic.

Niino felt that the game's pacing and flow needed to be addressed, as after naming the characters, the player immediately is prompted to divide their status points.|$|E
5|$|Relatively common {{where it}} occurs, kitefin sharks are usually solitary in nature but may form small groups. It {{is a slow}} swimmer with a large liver filled with squalene, a lipid less dense than water, {{allowing}} it to maintain neutral buoyancy and hover above the bottom with little effort. Studies {{off the coast of}} North Africa and in the Gulf of Genoa have found males outnumbering females by 2:1 and 5:1 respectively; this <b>imbalanced</b> sex ratio has not been observed off South Africa and may reflect sampling bias. The kitefin shark is preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks, as well as by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). Parasite data on this species is limited; an examination of two sharks caught off Ireland found three nematodes in the stomach lumen. One could be identified as Anisakis simplex L3, while another may have been a larval Raphidascaris.|$|E
5|$|Usually males, {{mainly in}} {{polygynous}} species, have shorter lifespans than females. This {{can be attributed}} to several reasons: early dispersal of young males, aggressive male-male fights, vulnerability to predation (particularly when males are less agile, as in kudu), and malnutrition (being large in size, the male body has high nutritional requirements which may not be satisfied). Richard Despard Estes suggested that females mimic male secondary sexual characteristics like horns to protect their male offspring from dominant males. This feature seems to have been strongly selected to prevent male mortality and <b>imbalanced</b> sex ratios due to attacks by aggressive males and forced dispersal of young males during adolescence.|$|E

5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. <b>Imbalanced</b> diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.|$|E

40|$|Uneven load {{allocations}} {{and random}} load behaviors {{are two major}} causes for three-phase power <b>imbalance.</b> The former mainly cause systematic <b>imbalance,</b> which can be addressed by low-cost phase swapping; the latter contribute to random <b>imbalance,</b> which requires relatively costly demand-side managements. To reveal the maximum potential of phase swapping and the minimum need for demand-side managements, this paper first proposes a novel a priori judgment to classify any set of three-phase power series into one of four scenarios, depending on {{whether there is a}} definite maximum phase, a definite minimum phase, or both. Then, this paper proposes a new method to decompose three-phase power series into a systematic <b>imbalance</b> component and a random <b>imbalance</b> component as the closed-form solutions of quadratic optimization models that minimize random <b>imbalance.</b> A degree of power <b>imbalance</b> is calculated based on the systematic <b>imbalance</b> component to guide phase swapping. Case studies demonstrate that 72. 8 % of 782 low voltage substations have systematic <b>imbalance</b> components.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} use of {{simulations}} to investigate wind turbine mass and aerodynamic <b>imbalances.</b> Faults caused by mass and aerodynamic <b>imbalances</b> constitute {{a significant portion of}} all faults in wind turbine. The aerodynamic <b>imbalances</b> effects such as deviations between the three blades pitch angle are often underrated and misunderstood. In practice, for many wind energy converters the blade adjustment is found to be sub-optimal. The dynamics of a model wind turbine was simulated in three different scenarios that are normal operating conditions, blade <b>imbalance,</b> and aerodynamic <b>imbalance.</b> Blade element momentum method was used {{to determine the effects of}} blade deviations. The blade <b>imbalance</b> was simulated by scaling the mass density of one blade, which creates an uneven distribution of mass with respect to the rotor. The results showed that an aerodynamic <b>imbalance</b> fault varies with rotor speed and wind velocity. They also reveal the extent of energy loss and additional loads. These conclude that, unlike mass <b>imbalance,</b> aerodynamic <b>imbalance</b> can’t be eliminated by counterweights. The balancing of the rotor requires a method to determine its <b>imbalances.</b> This paper proposes also a methodical system for the reconstruction of two types of <b>imbalances</b> that are, mass and aerodynamic <b>imbalances</b> from pitch angle deviation. The methodical system with simple finite element will be based on the inversion of the (nonlinear) operator equation that links the <b>imbalance</b> distribution of the rotor to its vibrations during operation of the wind turbine.
