They are especially useful for allowing people to grasp complex data structures. An interactive <b>data</b> <b>map</b> adds the functionality of people and systems being able {{to interact with the}} data through the use of the <b>data</b> <b>map.</b> This interaction may include navigation through parts of data structures or physically manipulating the underlying data. In this study the feasibility of utilising an interactive <b>data</b> <b>map</b> implemented for {{the purpose of}} energy management in industries, such as gold mining and cement manufacturing, is taken under consideration. The interactive <b>data</b> <b>map</b> forms part of a complete energy management system that entails automated data capturing, control systems data aggregation, automated reporting and online interactive data presentation. A software component, which is developed for the purpose of illustrating the use of such a <b>data</b> <b>map,</b> will serve as the main line of discussion. Various requirements from the current state of a airs are identi ed in the literature study. These are utilised as the basis of the speci cations against which the interactive <b>data</b> <b>map,</b> as an e cient software tool for control, communication and policy compliance, is validated and veri ed.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is twofold: On one hand we discuss an {{abstract}} approach to symmetrized Fredholm perturbation determinants and an associated trace formula for a pair of operators of positive-type, extending a classical trace formula. On the other hand, we continue a recent systematic study of boundary <b>data</b> <b>maps,</b> that is, 2 × 2 matrix-valued Dirichlet-to-Neumann and more generally, Robin-to-Robin maps, associated with one-dimensional Schrödinger operators on a compact interval [0, R] with separated boundary conditions at 0 and R. One of the principal new results in this paper reduces an appropriately symmetrized (Fredholm) perturbation determinant to the 2 × 2 determinant of the underlying boundary <b>data</b> <b>map.</b> In addition, as a concrete application of the abstract approach {{in the first part of}} this paper, we establish the trace formula for resolvent differences of self-adjoint Schrödinger operators corresponding to different (separated) boundary conditions in terms of boundary <b>data</b> <b>maps...</b>|$|R
