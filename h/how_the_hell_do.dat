Julicher responded by saying [...] "we haven't paid so <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> we own shares?"

However the Supporters' Club voted in favour of another EGM to remove the Miller-led board, as the contract with Blue Sky was revealed, confirming Julicher's words that the company were only ever planning to invest £500,000 in synthetic training pitches. In the December home game against Aldershot Town, 80% of Vale fans in attendance took part in the 'red card' protest against the board.
