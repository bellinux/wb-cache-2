40|$|A column {{method was}} {{developed}} to conveniently and reliably determine the soil organic partition coefficients (K-oc) of three insecticides (methiocarb, azinphos-methyl, fenthion), four fungicides (triadimenol, <b>fuberidazole,</b> tebuconazole, pencycuron), and one herbicide (atrazine), in which real soil acted as a stationary phase and the water solution of pesticide as an eluent. The processes of sorption equilibrium were directly shown through a breakthrough curve(BTC). The log K-oc values are 1. 69, 1. 95, 2. 25, 2. 55, 2. 69, 2. 67, 3. 10, and 3. 33 for atrazine, triadimenol, methiocarb, <b>fuberidazole,</b> azinphos-methyl, tebuconazole, fenthion and pencycuron, respectively...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} separation and determination of four benzimidazole fungicides (i. e., carbendazim, <b>fuberidazole,</b> thiophanate-methyl and thiophanate) in high salinity samples {{was developed by}} using salting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction (SALLE) via water-miscible acetonitrile as the extractant coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography. Box-Behnken design and response surface were employed to assist the optimization of SALLE conditions, including volume of salting-out solvent, the pH of sample solution and salting-out solvent as variable factors. The optimal salting-out parameters were obtained as follows: 2 mL of acetonitrile was added to 2 mL of sample solution with pH= 4 and then 2 mL salting-out solvent containing 5 mol L- 1 sodium chloride at a pH of 7 {{was added to the}} solution for extraction. This procedure afforded a convenient and cost-saving operation with good cleanup ability for the benzimidazole fungicides, such as good linear relationships (R> 0. 996) between peak area and concentration from 2. 5 ng mL(- 1) to 500 ng mL(- 1), low limits of detection between 0. 14 ng mL(- 1) and 0. 38 ng mL(- 1) and the intra-day precisions of retention time below 1. 0 %. The method recoveries obtained at fortified three concentrations for three seawater samples ranged from 60. 4 % to 99. 1 %. The simple, rapid and eco-benign SALLE based method proved potentially applicable for trace benzimidazole fungicides analysis in high salinity samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
