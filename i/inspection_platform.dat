40|$|Routine health {{surveillance}} of forestry plantations in Australia typically involves inspections from the air, roadside and ground to detect, identifY and map health {{problems caused by}} pests and diseases. An often-cited objective of routine {{health surveillance}} is the early detection of new incursions of exotic pests and diseases. To be effective, this requires the incursion be detected when damage is often cryptic either because of low incidence or low severity.

We measured the efficiency of aerial, roadside and ground inspections to detect nine different types of damage symptom ranging from very obvious (mortality and dead tops) to very cryptic (stern cankers and stern borers), each occurring at a range ofincidences among five 3 -year-old Eucalyptus globulus Labill. plantations.

40|$|Internal {{inspection}} of pipelines {{is an important}} tool for ensuring safe and reliable delivery of fossil energy products. Current inspection systems that are propelled through the pipeline by the product flow cannot be used to inspect all pipelines because of the various physical barriers they encounter. Recent development efforts include {{a new generation of}} powered <b>inspection</b> <b>platforms</b> that crawl slowly inside a pipeline and are able to maneuver past the physical barriers that can limit inspection. At Battelle, innovative electromagnetic sensors are being designed and tested for these new pipeline crawlers. The various sensor types can be used to assess a wide range of pipeline anomalies including corrosion, mechanical damage, and cracks. The Applied Energy Systems Group at Battelle is concluding the first year of work on a projected three-year development effort. In this first year, two innovative electromagnetic inspection technologies were designed and tested. Both were based on moving high-strength permanent magnets to generate inspection energy. One system involved translating permanent magnets towards the pipe. A pulse of electric current would be induced in the pipe to oppose the magnetization according to Lenz's Law. The decay of this pulse would indicate the presence of defects in the pipe wall. This inspection method is similar to pulsed eddy current inspection methods, with the fundamental difference being {{the manner in which the}} current is generated. Details of this development effort were reported in the first semiannual report on this project. This second semiannual report focuses on the development of a second inspection methodology, based on rotating permanent magnets. During this period, a rotating permanent magnet exciter was designed and built. The exciter unit produces strong eddy currents in the pipe wall. The tests have shown that at distances of a pipe diameter or more, the currents flow circumferentially, and that these circumferential currents are deflected by pipeline defects such as corrosion and axially aligned cracks. Simple sensors are used to detect the change in current densities in the pipe wall...|$|R

One of the <b>inspection</b> <b>platforms</b> used to scan for defects {{in and around the}} welds in the reactor vessel is called the T-crawler. The T-crawler operates under water in a radioactive environment by stepping on the vessel (reactor tank) inner wall using suction cups. The environment is harsh and many traditional positioning sensors are not suitable for implementation. This thesis investigates the possibility to use a gyroscope and a pressure sensor to create an alternative and independent positioning system. Together with the current positioning sensors the new sensors will be fused in a Kalman filter. The Kalman filter together with the alternative positioning system will be evaluated using simulated sensors in Matlab. The thesis shows that a positioning system with a pressure sensor and a gyroscope is suitable for implementation on the Tcrawler, but the thesis also establishes that further testing is needed to fully evaluate the performance of the alternative positioning during a safety inspection. Acknowledgements Thanks to the people at WesDyne for the help and information during the thesis, especially Lars Skoglund my supervisor, David Seery for information about the Tcrawler and David Stenman for information about radiation and proofreading the report.

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2016 Applications for small unmanned aerial vehicles have exploded {{over the past}} decade. Small size, maneuverability, low cost, and versatility enable utilization for applications not readily accessible by traditional manned aircraft, such as bridge inspections. However, the challenges associated with conducting inspections in a safe, cost efficient manner currently exceed the benefits of using an unmanned aircraft for inspection. The development of a multirotor-based inspection aircraft capable of maintaining flight for over eight hours is presented. Flight results from a bridge inspection conducted {{in collaboration with the}} Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) and Shafer, Kline, & Warren (SKW) bridge inspection crews are also discussed. Feedback and recommendations for <b>inspection</b> <b>platform</b> improvement from MoDOT and SKW inspectors was collected. Inspectors and flight crew identified challenges with camera exposure, dual pilotinspector remote control, and aircraft stability. As a result, a new <b>inspection</b> <b>platform</b> was developed allowing for wireless dual remote control and manual control of camera exposure. Finally, and most importantly, a new metric for quantifying UAS handling and pilot workload in GPS denied environments is introduced through rigorous flight testing and the use of a modified Cooper-Harper rating scale. Inspection of the bridge substructure prevented GPS lock and increased pilot workload. To mimic the effects of flying around a bridge flight testing is conducted at the UMKC parking garage where GPS lock is denied. The aircraft and inspection solutions discussed herein have demonstrated success for acquiring meaningful inspection data while conducting safe flight operations.

40|$|Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a {{procedure}} {{used to determine}} the location of a mobile vehicle in an unknown environment, while constructing a map of the unknown environment at the same time. Mobile platforms, which make use of SLAM algorithms, have industrial applications in autonomous maintenance, such as the inspection of flaws and defects in oil pipelines and storage tanks. A typical SLAM consists of four main components, namely, experimental setup (data gathering), vehicle pose estimation, feature extraction, and filtering. Feature extraction is the process of realizing significant features from the unknown environment such as corners, edges, walls, and interior features. In this work, an original feature extraction algorithm specific to distance measurements obtained through SONAR sensor data is presented. This algorithm has been constructed by combining the SONAR Salient Feature Extraction Algorithm and the Triangulation Hough Based Fusion with point-in-polygon detection. The reconstructed maps obtained through simulations and experimental data with the fusion algorithm are compared to the maps obtained with existing feature extraction algorithms. Based on the results obtained, it is suggested that the proposed algorithm can be employed as an option for data obtained from SONAR sensors in environment, where other forms of sensing are not viable. The algorithm fusion for feature extraction requires the vehicle pose estimation as an input, which is obtained from a vehicle pose estimation model. For the vehicle pose estimation, the author uses sensor integration to estimate the pose of the mobile vehicle. Different combinations of these sensors are studied (e. g., encoder, gyroscope, or encoder and gyroscope). The different sensor fusion techniques for the pose estimation are experimentally studied and compared. The vehicle pose estimation model, which produces the least amount of error, is used to generate inputs for the feature extraction algorithm fusion. In the experimental studies, two different environmental configurations are used, one without interior features and another one with two interior features. Numerical and experimental findings are discussed. Finally, the SLAM algorithm is implemented along with the algorithms for feature extraction and vehicle pose estimation. Three different cases are experimentally studied, with the floor of the environment intentionally altered to induce slipping. Results obtained for implementations with and without SLAM are compared and discussed. The present work represents a step towards the realization of autonomous <b>inspection</b> <b>platforms</b> for performing concurrent localization and mapping in harsh environments...|$|R
