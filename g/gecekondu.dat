50|$|Etimesgut {{began as}} a housing project of 50 homes ordered by Atatürk in 1924 to {{accommodate}} Turkish refugees from Bulgaria. From the 1950s, as poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city much illegal housing <b>gecekondu</b> was thrown up in this district. Some {{of this has been}} replaced by public housing projects such as Elvankent, Eryaman and Güzelkent and also military and civil service accommodation. However much <b>gecekondu</b> remains, inhabited by working-class people from cities such as Erzurum, many of whom commute to jobs in the city of Ankara.The Islamic terrorist organisation Hizbullah had a number of hidden cells here in the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|At present, some <b>gecekondu</b> {{areas are}} being {{gradually}} demolished {{and replaced by}} modern mass-housing compounds developed by the government's Housing Development Administration (TOKİ). Gecekondular are present both in small Turkish towns and in large cities such as Izmir, Ankara and Istanbul.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gecekondu</b> {{phenomenon}} is directly {{linked with the}} problems of unemployment and poverty in the rural areas of Turkey, especially in the east of the country. In many instances entire villages have migrated to the outskirts of the large industrialized cities in order to seek a better standard of living.|$|E
50|$|From the 1950s onwards {{people from}} Anatolia began to migrate to Istanbul {{in search of}} work. In most cases they {{illegally}} built themselves squats on unclaimed or government-owned land (see <b>gecekondu).</b> Some of these people settled in parts of Şişli in the 1950s and 1960s, especially in the northern sections of the district, around Mecidiyeköy.|$|E

50|$|Altındağ was the {{location}} {{of one of the}} first <b>gecekondu</b> developments in Turkey, when in the 1950s and 1960s people illegally built small, one-bedroom houses on small plots of land; then in the 1970s and 1980s these plots of land were made legal through amnesty legislation, and eventually sold to developers who replaced these shacks with larger, multi-story apartment buildings.|$|E
5000|$|In common usage, {{it refers}} to the low cost {{apartment}} buildings or houses that were constructed {{in a very short time}} by people migrating from rural areas to the outskirts of the large cities. Robert Neuwirth writes in his book Shadow Cities that these squatters are exploiting a legal loophole which states that if one starts building after dusk and moves into a completed house before dawn the next day without having been noticed by the authorities, then the next day the authorities are not permitted to tear the building down but instead must begin a legal proceeding in court (and thus it is more likely one can stay). Such buildings may be constructed without going through the necessary procedures required for construction, such as acquiring building permits, and can be very densely populated. Neuwirth states that [...] "half the residents of Istanbul - perhaps six million people - dwell in <b>gecekondu</b> homes". Despite connotations of urban poverty and overcrowding, almost all <b>gecekondu</b> neighbourhoods are supplied with running water and electricity.|$|E
50|$|Located {{just outside}} the city centre, (beyond the {{district}} of Ulus {{as far as the}} large Altınpark), this hillside has long been home to the workers in the city of Ankara but Altındağ remains one of the poorer quarters of the capital. The hillside is covered with illegally built <b>gecekondu</b> housing, home to low-income families. Among the housing there are some municipal buildings, public housing, state housing for civil servants and lots of small workshops doing car repairs and other light mechanical work.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} of Küçükçekmece is growing fast {{and it is}} acquiring schools, supermarkets, shopping centres and other facilities. However, {{in most parts of}} Küçükçekmece this is very much a poor, working-class neighbourhood, with much crime in dirty streets where men gather in badly lit cafes to play cards, drink tea and smoke cheap cigarettes. Most of the housing is illegally built <b>gecekondu.</b> Most of the people are recent migrants from Anatolia, increasingly from the troubled south-east. Traditionally there has been much left-wing sympathy, but recently it seems changing to the central right-wing.|$|E
50|$|In the Developing World, {{the major}} problem facing both economies and governments lies in owner-built settlements, favelas, villas miserias, <b>gecekondu,</b> or slums by any other name. Here the debate is more {{difficult}} to access, because for a long time, the problems and solutions found in informal settlements have been either ignored or misinterpreted by mainstream planners. Solutions to this exponentially growing problem are not obvious. Planetizen has commendably brought attention to this other side of urbanism, so often ignored by the urban planning schools. For example, it sponsored a discussion on the Bombay slum Dharavi, which brought the topic of slum clearance versus upgrading to world-wide attention.|$|E
50|$|When Ankara {{became the}} capital of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, it was {{designated}} as a planned city for 500,000 future inhabitants. During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the city grew in a planned and orderly pace. However, from the 1950s onward, the city grew much faster than envisioned, because unemployment and poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city in order to seek a better standard of living. As a result, many illegal houses called <b>gecekondu</b> were built around the city, causing the unplanned and uncontrolled urban landscape of Ankara, as not enough planned housing could be built fast enough. Although precariously built, {{the vast majority of them}} have electricity, running water and modern household amenities.|$|E

The fringes of the city however have seen uncontrolled expansion.|$|E
50|$|The {{character}} of Zeytinburnu changed {{when a large}} wave of immigrants from Anatolia came and settled there from 1950 on. Zeytinburnu is an important lesson for city planning in Turkey, because {{it was one of}} the first <b>Gecekondu</b> districts. In other words, most of the buildings were built illegally, without infrastructure, and without any aesthetical concern. In the 1960s legislation was passed to prevent this type of building but by then this type of development had become unstoppable. At first these were little brick-built single storey cottages. From the 1970s onwards the little houses were replaced by multi-storey concrete apartment blocks built in rows with no space in between. In most cases the ground floor was used as a small textile workshop, and thus Zeytinburnu became a bustling industrial area with a large residential population living above the workshops. All this was still illegal and unplanned and still lacked the infrastructure and the aesthetics. After a heavy rain the streets would run with dirty water for days.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the conquest}} of Constantinople, a {{predominantly}} Christian population settled in the neighborhood around the building. Despite that in 1506, under the reign of Sultan Bayezid II, a pious foundation endowed by Kasım Bey bin Abdullah (possibly at that time Sekbanbaşı, that is, chief (Agha) of the Janissaries), had a small mosque erected on {{the ruins of the}} building. To the mosque were endowed several shops and plots of land nearby, among them also the still existent Byzantine cistern named Ipek Bodrum (Silk Basement, so named because in Ottoman times the ample room was used as silk throwing workshop). The small mosque was heavily damaged by the 1894 Istanbul earthquake and by the Salmatomruk fire on 2 July 1919, so that afterwards only the perimeter walls and the base of the minaret were still standing. [...] Subsequently, abandoned {{from the middle of the}} 20th century, the edifice was used as a shanty (<b>Gecekondu),</b> but in the 1970s it was fully restored and is now open for worship.|$|E

But the district has been urbanized within the last decades. Most of the housing in Bağcılar was illegally built <b>Gecekondu</b> but has now been replaced by rows of cramped apartment buildings, also built with minimal regulation. It {{is a classic example of}} failed urban planning, perhaps exemplified by the fact that Bağcılar was not created as a district in its own right until 1992, by which time the original inhabitants had all left and building in the area was completely out of control. Bağcılar is now populated by recent immigrants from Anatolia, mostly young families, mostly poor, with many children. These people are struggling to survive in narrow streets of the most basic, undecorated buildings. There is little infrastructure to support the huge population, no parks, cinemas, and very few cultural or social amenities of any kind. Except one high profile white elephant: there are few trees in Bağcılar, but there is an Olympic Sports Complex. Also Bağcılar has been in the news recently as families in the area are failing to send girls to school.|$|E

5000|$|After the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, in {{sixteenth century}} the chapel {{became part of}} the large land estate bought by the hospodar of Moldavia to host his envoys in Istanbul, and named {{accordingly}} Boğdan Sarayi ("Moldavian Palace"). In this respect, its usage as private chapel of a patrician house represents a rarity in the Ottoman city. At the beginning of the eighteenth century the complex - a coveted property because the high border wall protected it by fires - was leased by the Sultan as residence for several foreign envoys, among them the Swedish ambassadors to the Ottoman Porte P. Strasburg and C. Rolomb, who sojourned in Istanbul in 1634 and 1657/58 respectively. In June 1760 the Phanariote John Callimaches endowed it to the Russian monastery of St. Pantaleon on Mount Athos. The complex burned down in the fire of 1784, and afterward the land was only used as a market garden. [...] The possession of the church by the Athos monastery was confirmed again by relatives of Callimaches in January 1795 and August 1814, but the Russian monks showed little interest in the church's restoration, possibly because of the state of war between the Russian Empire and the Sublime Porte. In the nineteenth century the edifice steadily decayed and after the 1894 Istanbul earthquake fell into ruin. In 1918 a German archaeologist pursued clandestine excavations and found in the crypt three unnamed tombs. In {{the second half of the}} 20th century the remains of the building were enclosed in a shanty (<b>Gecekondu),</b> and today—lying inside a tire shop—they are hardly accessible. As of 2012 the parts above ground have almost disappeared, and only the crypt still exists.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{experiences}} of rural migrant women in an apartment district and a squatter (<b>gecekondu)</b> settlement in Ankara, Turkey. It demonstrates the significant role the housing environment plays {{in the lives of}} women, both by defining who they are and by shaping their daily lives through encouraging some behavior and discouraging others. <b>Gecekondu</b> housing is potentially a source of negative identity for those migrant women whose reference group is the modern established urbanites, whereas those migrant women who take the <b>gecekondu</b> community as their reference group tend to preserve a positive image of themselves. On the other hand, apartment housing enhances a feeling of achievement in its residents of village origin. Furthermore, <b>gecekondu</b> housing encourages intimate social relations and thereby social control, whereas apartment housing demands some formality in neighborly relations and provides privacy. As social agents, women use their environment actively, attempting to foster certain images of themselves, and communicating those images to others as well as to themselves. This is particularly apparent in the case of modern <b>gecekondu</b> women who, by their outward appearances and demeanor, challenge the negative image attributed to <b>gecekondu</b> residents by the larger society...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} changes in <b>gecekondu</b> (slum house) communities through exploring {{the lives of}} three generations of rural migrants in Turkey. It suggests that the dynamic relation between their strategies and development policies in Turkey has had a large impact on the urban landscape, urban reforms, welfare policies and urban social movements. I followed qualitative research methodology, and was extensively influenced by feminist theory. Participant observation, in-depth interviews and focus group methods were used flexibly to reflect the richness of <b>gecekondu</b> lives. The data includes 83 interviews, one focus group and my observations in Ege neighbourhood in Ankara. First-generation rural migrants largely relied on kin and family networks and established <b>gecekondu</b> communities which provided them with shelter against the insecurities of urban life and their exclusion from the mainstream. The mutual trust within <b>gecekondu</b> communities {{was a result of}} their solidarity and collective struggle to obtain title deeds and infrastructure services. The liberalization of the Turkish economy immediately after the coup d’état in 1980 brought in <b>Gecekondu</b> Amnesties which legalized the gecekondus built before 1985 and fragmented labour market, resulting in a fragmentation among them in terms of <b>gecekondu</b> ownership, types of jobs and the scope of their resources. Since their interests were no longer the same in the face of development policies, their solidarity decreased and collective strategies were replaced by individual tactics. The dissolving of the sense of community was most visible in the area of urban transformation projects, which were based on legal ownership of houses and social assistance, and created new tensions in the 2000 s. The younger generation of <b>gecekondu</b> dwellers integrated into city life predominantly through education and employment opportunities in the city. They felt far more a part of the urban economy and considered community ties to be a constraint upon their integration. This study shows that this broke <b>gecekondu</b> people’s ties, which were the basis of their existence. ...|$|E

On the other hand, apartment housing is perceived by its rural migrant residents as a means of becoming closer to established urban society, and hence as a means of granting them higher status.
