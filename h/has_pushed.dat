Factors other than actual and authorized sentences may be relevant to seriousness, but so far the Court <b>has</b> <b>pushed</b> back against expanding the jury right.|$|E
5|$|The K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj conquered Zaculeu in the Postclassic. Traditionally {{that has}} been {{calculated}} as during the 15th century AD based on ethnohistoric accounts. Radiocarbon dating <b>has</b> <b>pushed</b> back the calculations of the K'iche' conquests by three centuries, and researchers now say their conquest of the Mam kingdoms may have taken place {{as early as the}} 12th century. The city was dominated by the K'iche' until the Spanish Conquest of the early 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Néstor Kirchner became {{president}} in May 2003. In the mid-2000s, export of unprocessed soybeans and of soybean oil and meal generated more than 20% of Argentina's export revenue, triple the joint {{share of the}} traditional exports, beef and wheat. Export taxes comprised 8% to 11% of the Kirchner government's total tax receipts, around two-thirds of which came from soy exports. Taxes on imports and exports increased government spending from 14% to 25% of GDP. However, the import and export taxes have discouraged foreign investment, while high spending <b>has</b> <b>pushed</b> inflation over 20%.|$|E

The country <b>has</b> <b>pushed</b> {{for the construction}} of more railway lines to connect Berlin to east China to reduce shipping time. It proposed major high-speed railway lines going towards Europe via Russia and Kazakhstan and another through the Middle East via Tajikistan, a potential future member for the union.

5|$|There {{are only}} two exposed {{contacts}} of Siletzia with the older (pre-Cenozoic) North American basement. One is near Roseburg, Oregon, where it is thrust against formations of the Klamath Mountains (discussed below), the other is along the Leech River Fault on {{the southern end of}} Vancouver Island, where it <b>has</b> <b>pushed</b> the pre-Cenozoic Pacific Rim formation beneath the Wrangellia Terrane). Everywhere else the contact between Siletzia {{and the rest of the}} continent is concealed under younger deposits, especially the Cascade Range volcanics. The contact around the Olympic Mountains is actually the bottom contact with the underlying oceanic sediments, tilted up by the uplift of the Olympics and exposed by erosion of about 10 to 12km of overlying deposits.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to diversify the economy and make it less {{dependent}} on export goods, the government <b>has</b> <b>pushed</b> to increase tourism to Malaysia. As a result, tourism has become Malaysia's third largest source of foreign exchange, although it is threatened by {{the negative effects of}} the growing industrial economy, with large amounts of air and water pollution along with deforestation affecting tourism. The tourism sector came under some pressure in 2014 when the national carrier Malaysia Airlines had one of its planes disappear in March, while another was brought down by a missile over Ukraine in July, resulting in the loss of a total 537 passengers and crew. The state of the airline, which had been unprofitable for 3 years, prompted the government in August 2014 to nationalise the airline by buying up the 30 per cent it did not already own. Between 2013 and 2014, Malaysia has been listed {{as one of the best}} places to retire to in the world, with the country in third position on the Global Retirement Index. This in part was the result of the Malaysia My Second Home programme to allow foreigners to live in the country on a long-stay visa for up to 10 years. In 2016, Malaysia ranked the fifth position on The World's Best Retirement Havens while getting in the first place as the best place in Asia to retire. Warm climate with British colonial background made foreigners easy to interact with the locals.|$|E
