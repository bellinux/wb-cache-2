5|$|Mrs. Puff is SpongeBob's {{paranoid}} driving {{teacher and}} the owner of the town boating school, which is similar to a driver's education facility. She would like nothing more than to pass SpongeBob, as he is her most dedicated and hard-working student, but he routinely panics when he tries to drive a boat and fails every driving test he takes. His failures often result in crashes that lead to mass destruction and endanger Mrs. Puff. While she tries her best to be friendly and patient with her students, Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob's unintentional recklessness <b>exasperating.</b> She is the long-standing love interest and girlfriend of Mr. Krabs.|$|E
5|$|The {{refusal of}} the United States {{government}} to take promised military action {{in the face of}} North Vietnamese violations of the cease-fire is also examined as a key to the defeat. Adherents to this claim believed that South Vietnam could have been saved by another U.S. bombing campaign. The conflict between the executive and legislative branches of the American government, already severe before the onset of the Operation Linebacker II in 1972, was only more <b>exasperating</b> during 1975, when a new campaign would probably only have provoked even more Congressional outrage.|$|E
25|$|During Laurel's {{tenure as}} President, hunger {{was the main}} worry. Prices of {{essential}} commodities rose to unprecedented heights. The government exerted every effort to increase production and bring consumers' goods under control. However, Japanese rapacity had the better of it all. On the other hand, guerrilla activities and Japanese retaliatory measures brought the peace and order situation to a difficult point. Resorting to district-zoning and domiciliary searches, coupled with arbitrary arrests, the Japanese made the mission of Laurel's administration incalculably <b>exasperating</b> and perilous.|$|E

25|$|After {{completing}} college, VanDerveer {{took a year}} off, with a plan {{to return}} to law school. When she ran out of money she returned home. When her parents realized she was doing little beyond playing chess and sleeping, they urged her to help with her sister Marie's basketball team. Her sister was five years younger, and by the time Marie reached high school, the school had basketball teams for girls. The experience was <b>exasperating</b> in some ways, as the girls did not take it seriously, but VanDerveer realized coaching was something she loved.|$|E
25|$|Aman {{had gotten}} {{wind of the}} Egyptian {{decision}} to mobilize soon after it was taken, yet political fears of <b>exasperating</b> the already tense situation along the border delayed much needed reconnaissance flights. Only on February 23, after an American tip-off, did an Israeli Air Force (IAF) Sud-Ouest Vautour photograph the Suez Canal zone to bring back news that the 4th Armored Division had in fact left its garrison. A second flight over the Sinai a day later revealed {{the full extent of}} the Egyptian deployment. Egyptian forces had deployed both close to the border and in depth, and Israel's forces in the Negev, consisting of between 20 and 30 tanks, were now facing 500 Egyptian tanks and SU-100 tank destroyers.|$|E
25|$|The Fort Thompson {{line that}} had been set up by General Hill {{extended}} only from the river to the railroad. They ended on the right in a brickyard that would figure prominently in the fighting. Because the land farther to the right was fairly firm and would allow his position to be flanked, General Branch decided to extend the line beyond the railroad and end it in a swamp. This just about doubled the length of the defensive line. He made a major blunder in laying out the line, however. In haste to complete the extension and faced with an <b>exasperating</b> shortage of labor, he decided to use a small creek as a natural part of the line. This creek intersected the railroad at a point some 150 yards (135 meters) up from the brickyard. The line of breastworks therefore had a dogleg in its center.|$|E

500|$|Crawford {{was often}} {{irritable}} and some colleagues found him <b>exasperating</b> to work with. He {{was known for}} his lack of patience, and when angry or frustrated was known to fling his hat to the floor in a gesture of rage. His biographer Kitty Hauser noted that [...] "apparently trifling events left an indelible mark on him", for he would remember a perceived slight for decades. Bowden expressed the view that while Crawford [...] "had a quick temper, which he strove to control... he was essentially a friendly man", adding that he could be [...] "clubbable, hospitable and kind".|$|E

500|$|The first Hungarian chronicles {{were written}} in the late 11th or early [...] but their texts were {{preserved}} in manuscripts compiled in the 13th to 15th centuries. Most extant chronicles show that the earliest works contained no information {{on the history of}} the Hungarians before their conversion to Christianity in the 11th century. The only exception is the Gesta Hungarorum, which is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle, whose principal subject is the Magyars' pagan past. However, the reliability of this work, which was written by a former royal notary now known as Anonymus, is suspect. In his monograph of medieval Hungarian historians, Carlile Aylmer Macartney describes it as [...] "the most famous, the most obscure, the most <b>exasperating</b> and most misleading of all the early Hungarian texts".|$|E
500|$|Potter was at Hill Top in July 1906 {{during the}} {{development}} of Miss Moppet, and the kitten she borrowed as a model from a mason from Windermere was a difficult subject. [...] "n <b>exasperating</b> model," [...] Potter wrote, [...] "I have borrowed a Kitten and I am rather glad of the opportunity of working at the drawings. It is very young and pretty and a most fearful pickle." [...] Biographer Linda Lear explains that [...] "pickle" [...] was a word Potter used to describe [...] "free-thinking exuberant people, like her cousin Caroline, or mischievous kittens and small children." [...] Potter used the same drawings of the kitten {{as a model for}} her next book, The Tale of Tom Kitten, which she dedicated in 1907 [...] "to all Pickles—especially those that get upon my garden wall". Miss Moppet is one of Tom Kitten's sisters, and appears as a character in both books featuring him: The Tale of Tom Kitten and The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or The Roly-Poly Pudding (1908).|$|E
500|$|The {{structure}} of the book drew mixed reactions, with Toronto Star's Kim Hughs describing it as [...] "the novel's most defining feature and its most <b>exasperating</b> conceit". She believed that Pari {{was meant to be}} the protagonist of the story but that the shifting focus on the numerous other personalities left her [...] "barely [...] through the clutter". The Independent's Arifa Akbar stated, [...] "The changing points of view and leaps in time can confuse and confine, leaving characters clearly defined but lacking depth. Decades gallop by and {{it is as if the}} story of these interconnected, cross -generational lives will simply go on echoing the original crime of Abdullah and Pari's separation." [...] Michiko Kakutani from The New York Times thought the novella-like storytelling was handled well and wrote, [...] "Khaled Hosseini's new novel, And the Mountains Echoed, may have the most awkward title in his body of work, but it's his most assured and emotionally gripping story yet, more fluent and ambitious than The Kite Runner (2003), more narratively complex than A Thousand Splendid Suns (2007)." [...] Kamal agreed, saying that the structure was [...] "exquisitely crafted". Scoop Empires Sherine El Banhawy added that the focus on multiple characters allowed to readers to gain a better understanding of the diversities of Afghan culture.|$|E

500|$|In mid-2013, a {{relatively}} unknown artist Boots, signed a publishing deal with Jay-Z's Roc Nation. In {{an interview for}} Pitchfork after the album's release, Boots was coy when answering questions about how Beyoncé discovered his demo or of his work previous to the project, only confirming his signing. In June 2013, they met in person {{for the first time}} and Boots presented Beyoncé with material he felt would resonate with her. However, Beyoncé was more interested in his experimental material, and he reluctantly played her his song [...] "Haunted" [...] on his cellphone. She refused to ignore its potential. At a later meeting, he played her a stream of consciousness rap called [...] "Ghost", which he wrote after an <b>exasperating</b> meeting with a potential record label. Boots began by composing a melody that reminded him of a hypnotic state, then layering guitar arpeggios to resemble the work of English electronic musician Aphex Twin. Subsequently, [...] "Ghost" [...] became the first half of [...] "Haunted"; he later described Beyoncé as the [...] "only visionary in the room" [...] for her ability to find potential in scraps of songs. Following these sessions, Boots would go on to work on eighty percent of Beyoncé.|$|E
500|$|A {{representative}} of UNICEF {{estimated that the}} magnitude of the flooding was the worst in 600years, attributing the scope to climate change. The areas effected [...] primarily Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah governorates [...] are usually dry and unsuited for such flooding. This resulted in the second worst natural disaster on record in Yemen, following deadly floods in 1996. Overall, the floods killed around 180people in Yemen, with many corpses carried away by the deluge. Illegal alterations in canal and drainage systems caused the floods to impact many houses and buildings, and the governor of Hadhramaut credited the invasive Prosopis juliflora weed as <b>exasperating</b> floods after blocking waterways. Throughout the country, the floods destroyed 2,826houses and damaged another 3,679, leaving about 25,000people homeless; many of these houses were made of mud, washed away by the floodwaters. The displaced utilized temporary shelters in mosques and schools, or stayed with family and friends. Damage to housing, hospitals, and education was estimated at $200million. The UNESCO World Heritage Site at Shibam [...] dating back to the 3rd century and housing tall mud buildings from the 17th century [...] was surrounded by floodwaters, causing some of the dwellings to collapse. Businesses and other infrastructure projects were also destroyed.|$|E
500|$|Following her New Haven trip, Mary was {{recovering}} from a bout of pneumonia when in June 1658 two Quaker activists, Christopher Holder and John Copeland came to Boston. [...] They had already been evicted {{from other parts of}} the colony, and were <b>exasperating</b> the magistrates. [...] Being joined by John Rous from Barbadoes, the three men were sentenced to having their right ears cut off, and the sentence was carried out in July. [...] As biographer Plimpton wrote, the men [...] "were so stalwart while their ears were removed" [...] that additional punishment in the form of whippings were carried out for the next nine weeks. [...] Word of this cruelty reached Dyer while she was visiting Richard and Katherine Scott in Providence. [...] Richard Scott was considered to be the first Quaker in Providence. [...] The Scotts had two daughters, Mary, the older, who was engaged to Christopher Holder, and Patience, the younger, aged 11. [...] Mrs. Scott and her two daughters, along with Mary Dyer and her friend Hope Clifton, were all compelled to go to Boston to visit with Holder and the other men in jail. The four women and child were all imprisoned. Three other people who had also come to visit Holder and were then imprisoned were Nicholas Davis from Plymouth, the London merchant William Robinson and a Yorkshire farmer named Marmaduke Stephenson, the latter two on a Quaker mission from England.|$|E

500|$|Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek {{believed}} the episode was [...] "well-schooled" [...] in the horror genre, [...] "with plenty of freaking out and jumping at shadows. Arnold and Price's elegant music {{came to the}} fore wonderfully in the largely wordless scenes of Watson and Henry's fearful hallucinations." [...] Mellor was also appreciative of McGuigan's [...] "stylish hand" [...] as director, particularly highlighting the [...] "mind palace" [...] sequence, as well as Tovey's performance as Henry Knight and for [...] "once again" [...] seeing Watson's role for being [...] "more than just sigh exasperatedly at his flatmate and apologise to others on Sherlock's behalf." [...] In summary, the reviewer stated [...] "I can only echo Sherlock's own closing words to Henry: [...] "This case, thank you, it's been brilliant"." [...] Chris Tilly of IGN rated the episode a [...] "good" [...] 7 out of 10, but stated that although the it was [...] "full of mystery and intrigue," [...] the central story [...] "wasn't strong enough to fill the 90-minute run-time, running out of steam at the mid-way point and padded out with irrelevant and at times <b>exasperating</b> efforts to throw the audience off the scent." [...] Tilly praised Cumberbatch's performance as a mentally broke down Holmes, and Freeman for being [...] "let off the leash this week, with Watson investigating solo on a couple of occasions," [...] and also thought Tovey was a [...] "fine addition to the ensemble." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1792 Sophia and {{her sister}} Mary were being {{included}} in more family activities, and at age fourteen, Sophia debuted at court on her father's birthday, 4 June 1792. According to biographer Christopher Hibbert, in her young adulthood Sophia was a [...] "delightful though moody girl, pretty, delicate and passionate." [...] As within her childhood, Sophia was devoted to her father, though she occasionally found him <b>exasperating.</b> She wrote that [...] "the dear King is all kindness to me, and I cannot say how grateful I feel for it." [...] Prior to 1788, King George had told his daughters {{that he would take}} them to Hanover and find them suitable husbands despite misgivings he had, which stemmed from his sisters' own unhappy marriages. He remarked, [...] "I cannot deny that I have never wished to see any of them marry: I am happy in their company, and do not in the least want a separation." [...] However, the King suffered his first bout of madness that year, when Sophia was aged eleven. Sophia remarked of her father's behaviour, [...] "He is all affection and kindness to me, but sometimes an over kindness, if you can understand that, which greatly alarms me." [...] Further lapses into insanity occurred in 1801 and 1804, thus forestalling talk of marriage for his daughters. The question of matrimony was rarely raised; Queen Charlotte feared the subject, something which had always discomforted the King, would push him back into insanity. Furthermore, the queen, strained from her husband's illness, wanted the princesses to remain close to her.|$|E
500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was disappointed, {{arguing that}} [...] "All the story's power {{is allowed to}} leak away by the deliberative {{heaviness}} with which Rivette pads through his 150-minute narrative, with its <b>exasperating</b> lack of dramatic emphasis." [...] Philip French noted similarities to Hitchcock's Vertigo and Jean Cocteau's Orphée, but called it [...] "surprisingly flat and unmagical". The New York Times also found it [...] "dry and overdetermined," [...] and Time Out complained that it [...] "never supplies the frissons expected of a ghost story or the emotional draw of a good love story." [...] Film 4 compared it to The Sixth Sense and The Others, but said that [...] "its glacially slow pace will frustrate {{all but the most}} patient". (Rivette said when promoting the film that [...] "I like The Sixth Sense because the final twist doesn't challenge everything that went before it. You can see it again, which I did, and it's a second film that's just as logical as the first one. But the end of The Others made the rest of it meaningless.") [...] "An intellectual exercise in metaphysical romance - Ghost for art-house audiences" [...] was Empire wry take. The Digital Fix argued that Rivette's direction resulted in a product that [...] "if never exactly dull and certainly the work of a master, is ultimately an empty film that has nothing to offer but its own cleverness". Keith Uhlich of Slant Magazine found it was [...] "a lesser Rivette offering — a watchable, ultimately unfulfilling ghost story".|$|E
