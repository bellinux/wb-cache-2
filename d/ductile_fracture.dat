40|$|The {{literature}} is reviewed regarding {{the influence of}} hydrogen on dual-phase (DP), transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP), and twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steels. Hydrogen influences DP steels by decreasing ductility while strengths are largely unaffected. TRIP steels may be susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) {{as indicated by the}} loss of ductility and some brittle fracture features. The literature on the influence of hydrogen on TWIP steels was inconsistent. Some researchers found no significant influence of hydrogen on TWIP steel properties and fully <b>ductile</b> <b>fractures,</b> whereas others found a significant loss of ductility and strength due to hydrogen and some brittle features.

50|$|At higher temperatures, {{the yield}} {{strength}} decreases, {{and leads to}} the formation of the plastic zone. Cleavage is likely to initiate at the elastic-plastic zone boundary, and then link back to the main crack tip. This is usually a mixture of cleavages of grains, and <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> of grains known as fibrous linkages. The percentage of fibrous linkages increase as temperature increases until the linkup is entirely fibrous linkages. In this state, even though yield strength is lower, the presence of <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> and a higher crack tip radius of curvature results in a higher toughness.|$|E
50|$|Fracture {{toughness}} is {{a quantitative}} {{way of expressing}} a material's resistance to brittle fracture when a crack is present.

30|$|We, thus, {{interpret}} {{that the}} discrepancy between the variations in the stressing rate estimated from shear wave splitting and from coda Q reflects the difference of the variation in stressing rate between the brittle upper crust and the ductile part below the brittle-ductile transition zone in the crust. From this point of view, we prefer the weak zone model (Iio et al., 2002) as the cause of the NKTZ. The weak zone model explains the high strain rate in terms of deformations in a weak zone with lower viscosity in the lower crust beneath the NKTZ. The high deformation rate inferred from the high stressing rate from coda Q possibly suggests that a weak zone is formed by <b>ductile</b> <b>fractures</b> as argued by Jin and Aki (2005).|$|R

The results of the studies have been complemented with the prediction of the occurrence of <b>ductile</b> <b>fractures</b> during forging.

40|$|The {{deformation}} and fracture behaviour in notched {{tension of}} nylon- 6 /polybutadiene blends is studied {{as a function}} of strain rate and temperature. The sensitivity of the fracture behaviour to strain rate and temperature decreases with increasing rubber content. Unmodified nylon- 6 can show ductile behaviour below Tg, when the strain rate is sufficiently low. No discontinuous change in fracture energy is observed when passing the Tg of the matrix in the case where the fracture type is already <b>ductile.</b> The <b>fracture</b> energy appeared to decrease with increasing rubber content (tested in tension as well as tested with the Izod impact test) when the <b>fracture</b> type was <b>ductile.</b> In the case of <b>ductile</b> behaviour, <b>fracture</b> is preceded by massive yielding of the entire cross-section of the specimen...|$|R
50|$|Another {{failure mode}} {{that may occur}} without any tearing is <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> after plastic {{deformation}} (ductility). This may occur {{as a result of}} bending or shear deformation (inplane or through the thickness). The failure mechanism may be due to void nucleation and expansion on a microscopic level. Microcracks and subsequent macrocracks may appear when deformation of the material between the voids has exceeded the limit. Extensive research has focused in recent years on understanding and modeling <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture.</b> The approach has been to identify ductile forming limits using various small-scale tests that show different strain ratios or stress triaxialities. An effective measure of this type of forming limit is the minimum radius in roll-forming applications (half the sheet thickness for materials with good and three times the sheet thickness for materials with low formability).|$|E
5000|$|In <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture,</b> {{extensive}} {{plastic deformation}} (necking) takes place before fracture. The terms rupture or ductile rupture describe the ultimate failure of ductile materials loaded in tension.

50|$|Professor Needleman's main {{research}} interests {{are in the}} computational modeling of deformation and fracture processes in structural materials, in particular metals.

Ongoing research projects involve studies of <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> and ductile-brittle transitions; crack growth in heterogeneous microstructures with particular emphasis {{on the role of}} interfaces; nonlocal and discrete dislocation plasticity; fatigue crack growth; and fast fracture in brittle solids.|$|E
30|$|From {{integrated}} analysis, {{the normal}} {{direction of the}} fracture surface is in conformity with the drawing direction of the alloy without Y, indicating that brittle fractures appear. When the Y content is 0.1 %, the fine grain begins to be strengthened so that the comprehensive mechanical properties increase and the alloy tends to be cracked through <b>ductile</b> <b>fractures.</b> With the increase of Y, small quantities of Y get dissolved in matrix merely because of its unique properties such as large radius, high activation energy in diffusion and the limited solubility of solid solution, however most Y aggregates on GBs that stop Cu from diffusing and dissolving to (α-Al) phase. Therefore, with the dispersion strengthening of Cu interior of the matrix, the strength of matrix and boundaries is weakened.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} well known that <b>ductile</b> <b>fractures</b> of steels are {{accelerated}} by triaxial stresses. The characteristics of ductile crack initiation in steels are evaluated quantitatively using two-parameter criterion based on equivalent plastic strain and stress triaxiality. It has been demonstrated by authors using round-bar specimens with circumferential notch in single tension that the critical strain to initiate ductile crack from specimen center depends considerably on stress triaxiality, but surface cracking of notch root is in accordance with constant strain condition. This study fundamentally clarifies the effect of strength mismatch, which can elevate plastic constraint due to heterogeneous plastic straining under static loading, on critical conditions for ductile cracking from the pre-notch root. In order to evaluate the stress/strain state in the pre-notch root of specimens, a thermal elastic-plastic finite element (FE) analysis has been carried out...|$|R
50|$|Some {{types of}} {{mechanical}} failure mechanisms are: excessive deflection, buckling, <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture,</b> brittle fracture, impact, creep, relaxation, thermal shock, wear, corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, and {{various types of}} fatigue. Each produces {{a different type of}} fracture surface, and other indicators near the fracture surface(s). The way the product is loaded, and the loading history are also important factors which determine the outcome. Of critical importance is design geometry because stress concentrations can magnify the applied load locally to very high levels, and from which cracks usually grow.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanically speaking, ceramic {{materials}} are brittle, hard, strong in compression and weak in shearing and tension. Brittle materials may exhibit significant tensile strength by supporting a static load. Toughness indicates how much energy a material can absorb before mechanical failure, while fracture toughness (denoted KIc [...] ) describes {{the ability of}} a material with inherent microstructural flaws to resist fracture via crack growth and propagation. If a material has a large value of fracture toughness, the basic principles of fracture mechanics suggest that it will most likely undergo <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture.</b> Brittle fracture is very characteristic of most ceramic and glass-{{ceramic materials}} which typically exhibit low (and inconsistent) values of KIc.|$|E
50|$|Crack {{initiation}} and propagation accompany fracture. The manner {{by which}} the crack propagates through the material gives great insight into the mode of fracture. In ductile materials (<b>ductile</b> <b>fracture),</b> the crack moves slowly and {{is accompanied by a}} large amount of plastic deformation around the crack tip. The crack will usually not extend unless an increased stress is applied. On the other hand, in dealing with brittle fracture, cracks spread very rapidly with little or no plastic deformation. The cracks that propagate in a brittle material will continue to grow and increase in magnitude once they are initiated. In a part made of a ductile material, the crack may progress to a section of the part where stresses a slighly lower and stop due to the blunting effect of plastic deformations at the crack tip. Another important mannerism of crack propagation {{is the way in which}} the advancing crack travels through the material. A crack that passes through the grains within the material is undergoing transgranular fracture. However, a crack that propagates along the grain boundaries is termed an intergranular fracture.|$|E
30|$|According to {{the results}} above, the micro-structure of the as-cast Al–Cu–Mn alloy is {{relatively}} loose bits of aperture formed on fracture sections during the casting and cooling process which relates to {{the properties of the}} studied alloy. A large number of small and shallow dimples indicate the tendency of <b>ductile</b> <b>fractures</b> of as-cast alloy. However, the smooth and large particles on the cross section are incoherently arranged and lamellar compounds and the particle gaps emerged at the junction of large particles. Al–Cu–Mn alloy presents brittle fractures in those weak positions under additional tensile stress due to the poor degree of inter-granular connections. Meanwhile, gaps between large particles are also equivalent to micro-crack sources. Once stress is generated, micro-cracks will converge to grow and connect the main cracks which are blocked at GBs and consequently the as-cast alloy shows brittle fractures.|$|R

Consequent model calculations of deformation twinning in a cylindrical impact (Taylor) test result are compared with results reported in the original Taylor test experiments. For copper polycrystals, dislocation drag and grain size effects incorporated within a dislocation mechanics based constitutive model analysis show agreement with results reported recently from expanding ring test experiments. The different (bcc) α-iron and (fcc) copper equations are shown to fit α-iron and copper tensile impact results reported in a pioneering study by von Karman and Duwez.

During his post-doctoral days at Caltech, he worked with Rosakis on elastic-plastic solids with regard to crack initiation and growth and their studies on three-dimensional effects on elastic-plastic crack tip fields demonstrated the dominance of the effect at a distance of half the specimen thickness from the crack front. He has also worked on the deformation and fracture behaviour of bulk metallic glasses and is credited with the development of a method for quantifying the micro-mechanics of mixed mode <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> involving microvoid coalescence and shear band.

50|$|Generally, {{materials}} display {{either a}} flat R curve or a rising R curve. For a flat R curve, material resistance is constant {{with respect to}} crack extension. When the resistance curve is flat, it exhibits a critical value of energy release rate Gc. A material with a rising R curve, however, cannot be uniquely characterized with a single toughness value. A flawed structure fails when the driving force curve is tangent to the R curve, but this point of tangency depends on {{the shape of the}} driving force curve, which depends on the configuration of the structure. Materials with rising R curves are generally characterized by the value of G at the beginning of crack growth, but the precise moment of initiation is unclear. The R curve for an ideally brittle material is flat because the surface energy is a fixed property. Nonlinear behavior, like <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture,</b> can result in a rising R curve as the plastic zone at crack tip increases in size with extension. Falling R curves occur when a metal fails by cleavage. Cleavage propagation is unstable and very high strain rates are found near the crack tip. This suppresses plastic deformation.|$|E
5000|$|Earthquakes {{occur as}} a {{consequence}} of gradual stress increases in a region, and once it reaches the maximum stress that the rocks can withstand a rupture generates and the resulting earthquake motion is related to a drop in the shear stress of the system. Earthquakes generate seismic waves when the rupture in the system occurs, the seismic waves consist of different types of waves that are capable of moving through the Earth like ripples over water. The causes that lead to slow earthquakes have only been theoretically investigated, by the formation of longitudinal shear cracks that were analysed using mathematical models. The different distributions of initial stress, sliding frictional stress, and specific fracture energy are all taken into account. If the initial stress minus the sliding frictional stress (with respect to the initial crack) is low, and the specific fracture energy or the strength of the crustal material (relative to the amount of stress) is high then slow earthquakes will occur regularly.In other words, slow earthquakes are caused by a variety of stick-slip and creep processes intermediated between asperity-controlled brittle and <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture.</b> [...] Asperities are tiny bumps and protrusions along the faces of fractures. They are best documented from intermediate crustal levels of certain subduction zones (especially those that dip shallowly — SW Japan, Cascadia, Chile), but appear to occur on other types of faults as well, notably strike-slip plate boundaries such as the San Andreas fault and [...] "mega-landslide" [...] normal faults on the flanks of volcanos.|$|E

The proposed technique has provided a quantitative interpretation for such phenomena. It is clarified that a conventional measurement significantly overestimates the CTOD level. The transition behavior in CTOD has been revealed over a certain distance across an interface between the two phases, suggesting the existence of scaling effects that influence the microstructure/fracture relationship.
