5000|$|Braid's Account of Self-HypnotismIt is {{commonly}} said that seeing is believing, but feeling {{is the very}} truth. I shall, therefore, give the result of my experience of hypnotism in my own person. In the middle of September, 1844, I suffered from a most severe attack of rheumatism, implicating {{the left side of}} the neck and chest, and the left arm. At first the pain was moderately severe, and I took some medicine to remove it; but, instead of this, it became more and more violent, and had tormented me for three days, and was so excruciating, that it entirely deprived me of sleep for three nights successively, and on the last of the three nights I could not remain in any one posture for five minutes, from the severity of the pain. On the forenoon of the next day, whilst visiting my patients, every jolt of the carriage I could only compare to several sharp instruments being thrust through my shoulder, neck, and chest. A full inspiration was attended with stabbing pain, such as is experienced in pleurisy. When I returned home for dinner I could neither turn my <b>head,</b> <b>lift</b> my arm, nor draw a breath, without suffering extreme pain. In this condition I resolved to try the effects of hypnotism. I requested two friends, who were present, and who both understood the system, to watch the effects, and arouse me when I had passed sufficiently into the condition; and, with their assurance that they would give strict attention to their charge, I sat down and hypnotised myself, extending the extremities. At the expiration of nine minutes they aroused me, and, to my agreeable surprise, I was quite free from pain, being able to move in any way with perfect ease. I say agreeably surprised, on this account; I had seen like results with many patients; but it is one thing to hear of pain, and another to feel it. My suffering was so exquisite that I could not imagine anyone else ever suffered so intensely as myself on that occasion; and, therefore, I merely expected a mitigation, so that I was truly agreeably surprised to find myself quite free from pain. I continued quite easy all the afternoon, slept comfortably all night, and the following morning felt a little stiffness, but no pain. A week thereafter I had a slight return, which I removed by hypnotising myself once more; and I have remained quite free from rheumatism ever since, now nearly six years.|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{sniffing}} {{position is}} often considered optimal for direct laryngoscopy. Another concept of airway configuration involving a laryngeal vestibule axis and two curves {{has also been}} suggested. We investigated whether this theory can be supported mathematically and if it supports the sniffing position as being optimal for direct laryngoscopy. Methods. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed in 42 normal adult volunteers. The airway passage was divided into two curves - primary (oro-pharyngeal curve) and secondary (pharyngo-glotto-tracheal curve). Airway configuration was evaluated in the neutral, extension, <b>head</b> <b>lift,</b> and sniffing positions. The airway passage, point of inflection (where the two curves meet), its tangent, and the line of sight were plotted on each scan. Results. The point of inflection lay within the laryngeal vestibule in all positions. The <b>head</b> <b>lift</b> and sniffing positions caused the tangent {{to the point of}} inflection to approximate the horizontal plane. The sniffing, extension, and <b>head</b> <b>lift</b> positions caused a reduction in the area between the line of sight and the airway curve compared with the neutral position. Conclusions. A two-curve theory is proposed as a basis for explaining airway configuration. The changes in these curves with head and neck positioning support the sniffing position as optimal for direct laryngoscopy. Application of this new concept to other forms of laryngoscopy should be investigated. © 2010 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Journal of Anaesthesia.

Pancuronium 0. 1 mg kg" 1 or pipecuronium 0. 07 mg kg- 1 was given after induction of anaesthesia and neuromuscular block was adjusted to 75 % twitch depression {{at the time}} of antagonism. The following regimens were used: edrophonium 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg kg" 1, neostigmine 0. 04 mg kg" 1, pyridostigmine 0. 3 mg kg" 1 and edrophonium 0. 25 mg kg" 1 with pyri-dostigmine 0. 15 mg kg" 1. Antagonism was evalu-ated also by the <b>head</b> <b>lift</b> test. There was no difference between the reversibility of neuromuscu-lar block produced by pancuronium or pipe-curonium. Edrophonium produced a significantly faster antagonism than neostigmine or pyrido-stigmine but onset of action was not significantly faster than that of edrophonium with pyrido-stigmine. All regimens produced 100 % (or near 100 %) antagonism of twitch response within 15 min.

During recovery from neuromuscular block, we measured tidal volume, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEVJ negative inspiratory pressure (NIP), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), mid-expiratory flow rate (MEFR) and 5 -s <b>head</b> <b>lift.</b> The assessments were started when the train-of-four (TOF) ratio reached 0. 5 + 0. 001 and repeated at each 0. 1 + 0. 001 increase up to a ratio of 1. 0. All volunteers showed ptosis and diplopia after the first dose and difficulty in swallowing with subsequent doses. They also experienced a pleasant, relaxing sedative sensation. All could sustain <b>head</b> <b>lift</b> for 5 s at a TOF ratio of 0. 5 and higher, except for one subject who could not lift his head only at a ratio of 0. 5.

40|$|Objective: Our primary {{objective}} {{in this study}} is to compare the effects of the applications of desflurane and remifentanyl anaesthesia, along with lumbar epidural analgesia combined with desflurane on postoperative recovery in the cases who undergoing lower abdominal surgery. Methods: This study performed 240 patients who undergoing elective lower abdominal surgery. Patients were divided into two random groups as Group DR (desflurane + remifentanyl n= 120) and Group DL (desflurane +Lumbar Epidural Analgesia n= 120). The general anaesthesia in Group DR was performed through the use of desflurane and remifentanyl. Group DL was administered a general anaesthesia through a pre-operative epidural catheter insertion and an application of desflurane. Extubation, eye opening, <b>head</b> <b>lift</b> for 5 seconds, and the surgical durations of the patients as well as the postoperative side-effects were recorded. Modified Aldrete Scoring System was used to assess the recovery of the patients from anaesthesia. Results: According to the inter group comparison results between Group DR and Group DL, the duration of extubation, eye opening, <b>head</b> <b>lift</b> for 5 seconds and the average amount of elapsed time until the modified Aldrete Scoring reached 10 were found statistically and significantly shorter in Group DL than Group DR(respectively p= 0. 002, p< 0. 001, p< 0. 001, p< 0. 001). The duration of the first analgesic need was statistically and significantly longer in Group DL compared to Group DR (p< 0. 001). The postoperative patient satisfaction in Group DL was statistically and significantly higher than that in Group DR (p= 0. 010). Conclusion: The Epidural analgesia included in the general anaesthesia in lower abdominal surgery is considered by us to be the beneficial and efficient method of analgesia which leads to an earlier recovery of the patients without affecting the intraoperative hemodynamic stability and which boosts the patient satisfaction by providing a more efficient analgesia during the postoperative period...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Post-stroke motor {{recovery}} {{consists of}} both true recovery and compensatory movements. Although compensatory movements are learned more quickly early after stroke, {{the role of}} compensatory move-ment patterns in functional recovery is controversial. We investigated the role of compensatory movement patterns in the long-term functional motor recovery after stroke. [Subjects and Methods] Male Wistar rats were subjected to photothrombotic infarction to induce motor and sensorimotor cortex lesions. The rats were given task-specific training. Behavior tests and analyses of compensatory movement patterns (<b>head</b> <b>lift,</b> limb withdrawal impairment, phantom grasps, and pellet chasing) during the single-pellet reaching test were performed 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days post stroke. [Results] Successful retrieval during the single-pellet reaching test was significantly correlated with compensatory movement patterns in stroke groups. Motor cortex stroke showed significant correlation in limb withdrawal impairment and pellet chasing. But, sensorimotor cortex stroke was significant correlation in pellet chasing. [Conclusion] The data suggest that compensatory movements after stroke are correlated with spontaneous recovery. Since some compensatory movement patterns are detrimental to functional recovery, the correct timing of training and control of compensatory movement patterns might be important...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} the energy efficiency fluctuation behavior of an industrial centrifugal pump with a six-blade impeller, a full-scale three-dimensional (3 D) an unsteady state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was used. Five operational points with different flow fluxes were numerically investigated by using the Navier–Stokes code with shear-stress transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model. The predicted performance curves agreed well with the test data. A sine function was fitted to the transient calculation results and {{the results show that}} the efficiency fluctuates mainly on the blade passing frequency, while the fluctuation level varies with flow rate. Furthermore, high efficiency is not necessarily associated with low fluctuation level. The efficiency fluctuation level is high at part-load points, and becomes relatively low when flow rate exceeds the design value. The effect of change in torque is greater than that of the <b>head</b> <b>lift</b> with respect to fluctuations of efficiency. Based upon the analysis of velocity vector distribution of different impeller phase positions, a hypothesis which considers both the effect of pump’s structural shape and flow fluxes was proposed to explain the above behavior by analyzing the impeller–tongue interaction.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Topical local {{anaesthesia}} of the airway of anaesthetised children has many potential benefits. In our institution, lignocaine is topically instilled {{into the back}} of the mouth with the expectation that it will come into contact with the larynx. The volume and method of application varies between clinicians. There is no published evidence to support the plausibility of this technique. Aim: To determine whether this technique of instillation results in the local anaesthetic coming into contact with key laryngeal structures and whether this is influenced by volume or additional physical manoeuvres. Methods/Materials: Sixty three healthy anaesthetised children between six months and 16 years old had lignocaine stained with methylene blue poured {{into the back of}} their mouths. The volume and subsequent physical manoeuvre were determined by randomisation. A blinded observer assessed staining of the vocal cords, epiglottis, vallecula and piriform fossae by direct laryngoscopy. Airway complications were recorded. Results: Fifty three of the 63 children had complete staining of all four areas. Four children had one area unstained and all others had at least partial staining of all four structures. Nine children coughed following induction of anaesthesia. Coughing was more likely in children with incomplete staining (p= 0. 03), low volume lignocaine (p= 0. 003) and following a <b>head</b> <b>lift</b> (p= 0. 02). Conclusion: Oral administration of lignocaine without use of a laryngoscope frequently results in widespread coverage of key laryngeal structures and may reduce the risk of coughing...|$|E
40|$|The autoradiographic 14 C- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose {{method was}} used to {{determine}} local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) during propofol anesthesia and recovery in 52 regions of the rat brain. Control rats intravenously received 5 ml. kg- 1. h- 1 of the egg-oil-glycerol emulsion that constitutes the vehicle for propofol. Anesthetized animals received an iv bolus of propofol (20 mg/kg) followed by continuous infusion of the anesthetic at 12. 5, 25, or 50 mg. kg- 1. h- 1 for 1 h prior to injection of 14 C- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose and for the following 45 min. In addition, a fifth group of animals were studied immediately after awakening from a 20 mg/kg bolus of propofol as indicated by the first reappearance of <b>head</b> <b>lift.</b> All rats were spontaneously breathing room air throughout the experimental procedure. The general pattern of the cerebral metabolic response to propofol anesthesia was a dose-related, widespread depression of LCGU. At the three infusion rates of propofol tested, overall mean LCGU was reduced by 33 %, 49 %, and 55 %, respectively, and significant decreases were observed in 60 %, 85 %, and 90 % of the regions assayed. These effects were rapidly reversible, since in the recovery group, LCGU returned to near control values in the majority of the brain areas. Although all of the anatomofunctional systems (sensorimotor, extrapyramidal, limbic, and reticular) were involved, forebrain structures showed a greater sensitivity to the depressant action of propofol than did hindbrain regions.
