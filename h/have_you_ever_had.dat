But that's not saying much because Jay was running this race on one foot. In other words, Kanye didn't win, Jay lost". Digital Spy gave a mixed review of the song. [...] "Boasting three of the biggest stars from the worlds of hip-hop and R, 'Run This Town' {{was never going to be}} a flop, but neither is it a roaring success. Kanye's slick rapping ("Reebok baby, you need to try some new things, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> shoes without shoestrings?") and Rihanna's [...] "hey-hey" [...] chorus hook make Jay-Z seem surplus to requirements, which surely can't have been the aim. The chaotic military march beats are impressive – and hats off to Jigga for snubbing Auto-Tune – but this track still doesn't seem fitting of an artist considered a groundbreaking rap legend.|$|E

60|$|<b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> a {{difference}} with a dear friend? How his letters, {{written in the}} period of love and confidence, sicken and rebuke you! What a dreary mourning it is to dwell upon those vehement protests of dead affection! What lying epitaphs they make over the corpse of love! What dark, cruel comments upon Life and Vanities! Most of us have got or written drawers full of them. They are closet-skeletons which we keep and shun. Osborne trembled long before the letter from his dead son.|$|E

"Eccellenza, with a {{thousand}} welcomes," [...] Benedetta continued, as she placed the flask on the table, after having carefully removed the cotton and the oil with her own plump hand; this being one {{of half a dozen}} flasks of really sound, well-flavored, Tuscan liquor, that she kept for especial occasions; as she well might, the cost being only a paul, or ten cents for near half a gallon; [...] "Eccellenza, a million times welcome.

5000|$|Lyn {{was first}} scouted by an agency {{because of her}} voice and from there, she first made her debut under her real name, Lee Se-jin, and {{released}} an album. [...] The album sold poorly and was barely known. Lyn then took some time off to train vocally. She made a comeback in 2002 under the name Lyn with her supposedly first album <b>Have</b> <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Have</b> A Broken Heart?.

The album was very successful, surpassing her previous album with her popular single, [...] "사랑했잖아" [...] (Used To Love). Due to its popularity, the song was eventually covered on another successful singer Lee Seung-gi's album, released in late 2006. Lyn released her third album, The Pride of the Morning, on March 7, 2007, and sold 15,358 copies in that month, placing second in the Music Industry Association of Korea's monthly chart. [...] Again, it was a success and was once again reclaim her title {{as one of the best}} R&B female singer. Overall her album sold 25,171 copies.
