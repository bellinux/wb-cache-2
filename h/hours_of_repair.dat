40|$|Abstract Background Little {{is known}} about the {{cellular}} effects of exposure to mixed beams of high and low linear energy transfer radiation. So far, the effects of combined exposures have mainly been assessed with clonogenic survival or cytogenetic methods, and the results are contradictory. The gamma-H 2 AX assay has up to now not been applied in this context, and it is a promising tool for investigating the early cellular response to mixed beam irradiation. Purpose To determine the dose response and repair kinetics of gamma-H 2 AX ionizing radiation-induced foci in VH 10 human fibroblasts exposed to mixed beams of 241 Am alpha particles and X-rays. Results VH 10 human fibroblasts were irradiated with each radiation type individually or both in combination at 37 °C. Foci were scored for repair kinetics 0. 5, 1, 3 and 24 h after irradiation (one dose per irradiation type), and for dose response at the 1 h time point. The dose response effect of mixed beam was additive, and the relative biological effectiveness for alpha particles (as compared to X-rays) was of 0. 76 ± 0. 52 for the total number of foci, and 2. 54 ± 1. 11 for large foci. The repair kinetics for total number of foci in cells exposed to mixed beam irradiation was intermediate to that of cells exposed to alpha particles and X-rays. However, for mixed beam-irradiated cells the frequency and area of large foci were initially lower than predicted and increased during the first 3 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> (while the predicted number and area did not). Conclusions The repair kinetics of large foci after mixed beam exposure was significantly different from predicted based on the effect of the single dose components. The formation of large foci was delayed and they did not reach their maximum area until 1 h after irradiation. We hypothesize that the presence of low X-ray-induced damage engages the DNA repair machinery leading to a delayed DNA damage response to the more complex DNA damage induced by alpha particles. </p...|$|E

40|$|Tissue injury initiates a {{temporally}} ordered {{sequence of}} local cellular and metabolic responses presumably necessary for successful repair. Previous investigations demonstrated that metabolic evidence for {{nitric oxide synthase}} (NOS) activity is detectable in wounds only during the initial 48 to 72 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the <b>repair</b> process. Present results identify the cell types contributing inducible NOS (iNOS) to experimental wounds in rats. iNOS antigen was expressed in most macrophages present in wounds 6 to 24 hours after injury, and these cells exhibited NAPDH diaphorase and NOS activity. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes contained little iNOS antigen and no NADPH diaphorase activity and were minimally able to convert l-arginine to l-citrulline. The frequency of iNOS-positive macrophages declined on days 3 and 5 after wounding. By day 10, most macrophages in the wound were negative for iNOS. These cells, however, acquired iNOS antigen and activity in culture. Wound fluids, but not normal rat serum, suppressed the induction of iNOS during culture. Findings indicate that the expression of iNOS in healing wounds is restricted to macrophages present during the early phases <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> and that components of wound fluid suppress the induction of iNOS in macrophages in late wounds.

40|$|ObjectiveBlunt {{traumatic}} thoracic aortic disruption {{results in}} pre-hospital death in 80 % to 90 % of patients. Because {{of the significant}} surgical morbidity and mortality associated with open operative repair, endovascular stent-graft repair has been investigated. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of thoracic aortic disruptions treated with commercially available proximal aortic extension cuffs. MethodsNine patients with multiple system trauma (age range, 16 - 42 years) were seen after motor vehicle accidents between January 1, 2003, and April 1, 2004. Chest x-ray findings warranted thoracic computed tomography scans, which revealed disruptions of the thoracic aorta. Aortograms delineated the extent of the aortic injuries and identified a “landing zone” (neck length range, 1. 5 - 2. 0 cm) distal to the subclavian artery but proximal to the tear. The repairs were performed with AneuRx (n= 8) and Excluder (n = 1) proximal aortic extension cuffs. A left femoral artery approach was used in 6 patients, a suprainguinal retroperitoneal approach with an iliac conduit in 2 patients, and direct tunnel in 1 patient. An Amplatz super-stiff wire was placed in the right axillary artery to enable easy tracking of the endografts, and left brachial artery access was used for arch arteriography. ResultsIn each patient the stent-graft cuff was deployed adjacent to the left subclavian artery, with successful exclusion of traumatic disruptions verified at intraoperative arteriography and on computed tomographic scans obtained within 48 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> initial <b>repair.</b> One patient required a second cuff for exclusion of a type I endoleak at the distal attachment site 1 month after the initial endograft repair. There were no procedure-related deaths; 1 patient, however, died of other injuries. ConclusionsStent-graft <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> traumatic thoracic aortic disruptions is technically feasible. Placement of a stiff wire in the right axillary artery and percutaneous left brachial artery access for arteriography are useful adjuncts during endograft deployment. Endovascular stent grafts may enable definitive repair or serve as a bridge until the patient is stable enough to undergo an operation, if necessary. This technique warrants further investigation...|$|R
