40|$|Audio and vibrotactile output are the {{standard}} mechanisms mobile devices use to attract their owner's attention. Yet in busy and noisy environments, {{or when the}} user is physically active, these channels sometimes fail. Recent work has explored the use of physical shape-change as an additional method for conveying notifications when the device is in-hand or viewable. However, {{we do not yet}} understand the effectiveness of physical shape-change as a method <b>for</b> <b>communicating</b> in-pocket <b>notifications.</b> This paper presents three robustly implemented, mobile-device sized shape-changing devices, and two user studies to evaluate their effectiveness at conveying notifications. The studies reveal that (1) different types and configurations of shape-change convey different levels of urgency and; (2) fast pulsing shape-changing notifications are missed less often and recognised more quickly than {{the standard}} slower vibration pulse rates of a mobile device...|$|R

We establish guidelines for design tradeoffs based on significant differences in display facilitation of information monitoring, awareness, and introduction of distraction. These findings result from an experiment in which subjects browsed through information pages searching for answers to questions while simultaneously monitoring information in the load monitor. This research is critical in developing a framework for secondary display evaluation that should guide the design and use of visual notification systems requiring a division of user attention...|$|R

(Market sounding is a way of “assessing the reaction of the market to a proposed requirement and procurement approach, in order to bring supplier perspectives to public sector procurements at an early stage”. This exercise involved the publication of a Prior Information Notice in the Official Journal of the European Union and the engagement of intermediaries, such as the BERR funded Knowledge Transfer Networks, trade bodies and similar, to <b>communicate</b> <b>notification</b> of the call to the potential supply chain.|$|R
