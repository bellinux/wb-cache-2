25|$|The {{invasion}} was {{preceded by}} weeks of intense resistance activity. Coordinated with the massive bombardments of the Transportation Plan {{and supported by the}} SOE and the OSS, partisans systematically sabotaged railway lines, destroyed bridges, cut German supply lines, and provided general intelligence to the allied forces. The constant harassment took its toll on the German troops. Large remote areas were no-go zones for them and <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> for the maquisards, so-called after the maquis shrubland that provided ideal terrain for guerrilla warfare. For instance, a large number of German units were required to clear the maquis du Vercors, which they eventually succeeded with, but this and numerous other actions behind German lines contributed to a much faster advance following the Provence landings than the Allied leadership had anticipated.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the {{government}} had been diversifying their economic plans. Served by high oil prices, the country’s non-oil and gas GDP has outstripped that attributable to the energy sector. Non-oil and gas GDP now constitutes 64% of the UAE’s total GDP. This trend is reflected in Abu Dhabi with substantial new investment in industry, real estate, tourism and retail. As Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer of the UAE, it has reaped the most benefits from this trend. It has taken on an active diversification and liberalisation programme to reduce the UAE’s reliance on the hydrocarbon sector. This {{is evident in the}} emphasis on industrial diversification with the completion of <b>free</b> <b>zones,</b> Industrial City of Abu Dhabi, twofour54 Abu Dhabi media free zone and the construction of another, ICAD II, in the pipeline. There has also been a drive to promote the tourism and real estate sectors with the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority and the Tourism and Development Investment Company undertaking several large-scale development projects. These projects will be served by an improved transport infrastructure with a new port, an expanded airport and a proposed rail link between Abu Dhabi and Dubai all in the development stages.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{opinion polls}} taken before the 1984 election, 30 per cent of New Zealanders {{supported}} visits by US warships {{with a clear}} majority of 58 per cent opposed, [...] and over 66 per cent of the population lived in locally declared nuclear <b>free</b> <b>zones.</b> [...] Following {{the victory of the}} New Zealand Labour Party in elections in 1984, Prime Minister David Lange barred nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ships from using New Zealand ports or entering New Zealand waters. [...] Reasons given were the dangers of nuclear weapons, continued nuclear testing in the South Pacific, and opposition to US President Ronald Reagan's policy of aggressively confronting the Soviet Union. Given that the United States Navy refused to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons aboard ships, these laws essentially refused access to New Zealand ports for all United States Navy ships. In February 1985, a port-visit request by the United States for the USS Buchanan was refused by the New Zealand government on the basis that the Buchanan was capable of launching nuclear depth bombs. [...] An opinion poll commissioned by the 1986 Defence Committee of Enquiry confirmed that 92 per cent now opposed nuclear weapons in New Zealand and 69 per cent opposed warship visits; 92 per cent wanted New Zealand to promote nuclear disarmament through the UN, while 88 per cent supported the promotion of nuclear <b>free</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{end of the}} Corsican Guard, {{triggered}} by an incident that occurred in Rome on August20, 1662, gives an insight into {{the evolution of the}} geopolitical situation in Europe and on the growing French influence in Italy. Toward the middle of the 17th century, the presence in Rome of numerous diplomatic missions of the European states ended up creating a paradoxical situation in which the major powersthrough over-extension of the concept of extraterritoriality, the so-called [...] "liberty of quarters"had in some cases provided their embassies with real military garrisons (whose soldiers were free to bear weapons throughout the city), leading to the transformation of entire areas of the city center into <b>free</b> <b>zones,</b> where criminals and killers could find refuge, untouchable by the law.|$|E
2500|$|Under the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987 {{territorial}} sea and land of New Zealand became nuclear <b>free</b> <b>zones.</b> [...] The Act prohibits [...] "entry into the internal waters of New Zealand 12 n. mi. (22.2 km/13-13/16 st. mi.) radius by any ship whose propulsion is wholly or partly dependent on nuclear power" [...] and bans the dumping of radioactive waste {{into the sea}} within the nuclear-free zone, as well as prohibiting any New Zealand citizen or resident [...] "to manufacture, acquire, possess, or have any control over any nuclear explosive device." [...] Similar provisions were made for biological weapons. After this Act {{was passed by the}} Labour government of David Lange, the United States government suspended its ANZUS obligations to New Zealand. Following consultations with Australia and after negotiations with New Zealand broke down, the United States reiterated that it was suspending its treaty obligations until United States Navy ships were re-admitted to New Zealand ports, citing that New Zealand was [...] "a friend, but not an ally". The crisis made front-page headlines for weeks in many American newspapers, while many leading American senators were quoted as expressing a deep sense of betrayal. However, David Lange did not withdraw New Zealand from ANZUS, although his government's policy led to the US's decision to suspend its treaty obligations to New Zealand. The legislation was a milestone in New Zealand's development as a nation and seen as an important act of sovereignty, self-determination and cultural identity. Further, many were driven by a sense of responsibility to support peace and the rights of all humans, not just in New Zealand, but worldwide.|$|E
