25|$|A myotonic goat, {{otherwise}} known as the fainting goat, is a <b>domestic</b> <b>goat</b> that freezes for roughly 3 seconds when it feels panic. Though painless, this generally results in the animal collapsing on its side. The characteristic {{is caused by a}} hereditary genetic disorder called myotonia congenita. When startled, younger goats will stiffen and fall over. Older goats learn to spread their legs or lean against something when startled, and often they continue to run about in an awkward, stiff-legged shuffle.|$|E
25|$|Two {{introduced}} mammals {{are established}} on the islands. The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) {{was introduced to}} Rat Island around 1900, and the house mouse (Mus musculus) was introduced onto North Island in the 1970s, presumably with food. In 1995 the house mouse was reported as also present on Rat Island for many years before 1987, but a recent report {{makes no mention of}} this. In addition, three introduced mammals were previously established in the Houtman Abrolhos, but have since been eradicated. The black rat (Rattus rattus) was established on Pigeon and Rat Islands, but has been eradicated by poisoning. The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) has been introduced at various times onto Leo Island, Middle Island, Morley Island, Pelsaert Island and Wooded Island. In the case of Pelsaert Island, {{it is not clear whether}} it ever established; in all other cases, established populations have been eradicated by poisoning.

2500|$|Certain {{authors have}} {{postulated}} that the markhor is the ancestor of some breeds of <b>domestic</b> <b>goat.</b> The Angora goat has been regarded {{by some as}} a direct descendant of the Central Asian markhor. Charles Darwin postulated that modern goats arose from crossbreeding markhor with wild goats. Evidence for markhors crossbreeding with domestic goats has been found. One study suggested that 35.7% of captive markhors in the analysis (ranging from three different zoos) had mitochondrial DNA from domestic goats. Other authors have put forth the possibility of markhor being the ancestor of some Egyptian goat breeds, due to their similar horns, though the lack of an anterior keel on the horns of the markhor belies any close relationship. The Changthangi <b>domestic</b> <b>goat</b> of Ladakh and Tibet may derive from the markhor. The Girgentana goat of Sicily is thought to have been bred from markhor, as is the Bilberry goat of Ireland.

There are also pedigree classes at shows for entire goats. [...] There are separate pedigree lineages in Europe, Africa, (where they are sometimes called the African Pygmy) and the United States. And this is because there were only a few hundred pygmy goats imported from Africa around 60 years ago.|$|E

Markhor are sexually dimorphic, with males having longer hair on the chin, throat, chest and shanks. Females are redder in colour, with shorter hair, a short black beard, and are maneless. Both sexes have tightly curled, corkscrew-like horns, which close together at the head, but spread upwards toward the tips. The horns of males can grow up to [...] long, and up to [...] in females.

40|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>goats</b> {{are raised}} for meat, milk and hair production, in herds for {{rangeland}} weed control, and as pack animals. <b>Domestic</b> sheep, <b>goats</b> and wild bighorn sheep are all susceptible to a multifactorial pneumonia. We sampled 43 herd goats from 7 herds and 48 pack goats from 11 herds for viral and bacterial serology, parasitology, and Pasteurellaceae microbiology. The goats {{in this study}} were in generally good health, although most goats did harbor various pathogens and parasites including several bacteria, specifically Pasteurellaceae, which have been associated with pneumonia in free-ranging bighorn sheep. It is not known if <b>domestic</b> <b>goats</b> can transmit the Pasteurellaceae or other pathogens found in this study readily to wild bighorn sheep.

40|$|Bronchopneumonia is a {{population}} limiting disease of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) {{that has been}} associated with contact with domestic Caprinae. The disease is polymicrobial but is initiated by Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, which is commonly carried by both domestic sheep (O. aries) and goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). However, while previous bighorn sheep comingling studies with domestic sheep have resulted in nearly 100 % pneumonia mortality, only sporadic occurrence of fatal pneumonia was reported from previous comingling studies with <b>domestic</b> <b>goats.</b> Here, we evaluated the ability of <b>domestic</b> <b>goats</b> of defined M. ovipneumoniae carriage status to induce pneumonia in comingled bighorn sheep. In experiment 1, three bighorn sheep naïve to M. ovipneumoniae developed non-fatal respiratory disease (coughing, nasal discharge) following comingling with three naturally M. ovipneumoniae-colonized <b>domestic</b> <b>goats.</b> Gross and histological lesions of pneumonia, limited to small areas on the ventral and lateral edges of the anterior and middle lung lobes, were observed at necropsies conducted {{at the end of the}} experiment. A control group of three bighorn sheep from the same source housed in isolation during experiment 1 remained free of observed respiratory disease. In experiment 2, three bighorn sheep remained free of observed respiratory disease while comingled with three M. ovipneumoniae-free <b>domestic</b> <b>goats.</b> In experiment 3, introduction of a domestic goat-origin strain of M. ovipneumoniae to the same comingled goats and bighorn sheep used in experiment 2 resulted in clinical signs of respiratory disease (coughing, nasal discharge) in both host species.

6000|$|From {{the recent}} {{researches}} of M. Brandt, most naturalists {{now believe that}} all our goats are descended from the Capra aegagrus of the mountains of Asia, possibly mingled with the allied Indian species C. falconeri of India. (3/97. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Generale' tome 3 page 87. Mr. Blyth 'Land and Water' 1867 page 37 has arrived at a similar conclusion, but he thinks that certain Eastern races may perhaps be in part descended from the Asiatic markhor.) In Switzerland, during the neolithic period, the <b>domestic</b> <b>goat</b> was commoner than the sheep; and this very ancient race differed in no respect from that now common in Switzerland. (3/98. Rutimeyer 'Pfahlbauten' s. 127.) At the present time, the many races found in several {{parts of the world}} differ greatly from each other; nevertheless, as far as they have been tried (3/99. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 1 page 402.) they are all quite fertile when crossed. So numerous are the breeds, that Mr. G. Clark (3/100. 'Annals and Mag. of Nat History' 2nd series volume 2 1848 page 363.) has described eight distinct kinds imported into the one island of Mauritius. The ears of one kind were enormously developed, being, as measured by Mr. Clark, no less than 19 inches in length and 4 3/4 inches in breadth. As with cattle, the mammae of those breeds which are regularly milked become greatly developed; and, as Mr. Clark remarks, [...] "it is not rare to see their teats touching the ground." [...] The following cases are worth notice as presenting unusual points of variation. According to Godron (3/101. 'De l'Espece' tome 1 page 406. Mr. Clark also refers to differences {{in the shape of the}} mammae. Godron states that in the Nubian race the scrotum is divided into two lobes; and Mr. Clark gives a ludicrous proof of this fact, for he saw in the Mauritius a male goat of the Muscat breed purchased at a high price for a female in full milk. These differences in the scrotum are probably not due to descent from distinct species: for Mr. Clark states that this part varies much in form.), the mammae differ greatly in shape in different breeds, being elongated in the common goat, hemispherical in the Angora race, and bilobed and divergent in the goats of Syria and Nubia. According to this same author, the males of certain breeds have lost their usual offensive odour. In one of the Indian breeds the males and females have horns of widely-different shapes (3/102. Mr. Clark 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 2nd series volume 2 1848 page 361.); and in some breeds the females are destitute of horns. (3/103. Desmarest 'Encyclop. Method. Mammalogie' page 480.) M. Ramu of Nancy informs me that many of the goats there bear on the upper part of the throat a pair of hairy appendages, 70 mm. in length and about 10 mm. in diameter, which in external appearance resemble those above described on the jaws of pigs. The presence of inter-digital pits or glands on all four feet has been thought to characterise the genus Ovis, and their absence to be characteristic of the genus Capra; but Mr. Hodgson has found that they exist in the front feet of the majority of Himalayan goats. (3/104. 'Journal of Asiatic Soc. of Bengal' volume 16 1847 pages 1020, 1025.) Mr. Hodgson measured the intestines in two goats of the Dugu race, and he found that the proportional length of the great and small intestines differed considerably. In one of these goats the caecum was thirteen inches, and in the other no less than thirty-six inches in length! ...|$|E
