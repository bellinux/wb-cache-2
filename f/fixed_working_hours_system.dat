40|$|L'auteur présente les horaires flexibles, leurs avantages pour l'employeur et pour l'employé, leurs modalités d'application et les réactions de différentes parties à cette forme d'aménagement du temps de travail. For {{the last}} five years rigid working {{schedules}} have increasingly been under attack and many new experiences have been tried in many European countries, particularly in Germany and Switzeriand. The essence of these experiences has been to adapt working schedules to each worker through a flexible <b>hour</b> <b>system.</b> The basic principle of such a system is the free and individual choice of entry and exit time within certain limits. The flexible <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> <b>system</b> generally distinguishes three separate components to a working day : a core time when all employees must be at their job and two flexible time periods, at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the working day. Such a system has advantages for both the employer and the employee. As for the employer, such a system facilitates time Computing, encourages a decrease of short term absenteism and turnover, a reduction of internal traffic, a decrease of accidents on the way to work, a reduction of overtime, greater hiring advantages, and a longer service to the consumer. Moreover management workers may work in a more peaceful atmosphere, the social climate is ameliorated and internal conflicts are reduced. As for the employees, a reduction of transportation time has been noted, family and personal needs are given a better chance to be satisfied, and a change of attitude towards work was underlined. There is no best way to design and install such a system. There are many variations to it and adaptation is surely favorized under such a system. Experience, however, teaches some ground rules. First such a system much be progressively introduced. Experimentation is greatly encouraged. Second, it takes time for the system to give good results. Third, trial and error is often the best method. Fourth, rules must be established to avoid misunderstandings. Fifth, pragmatism is the golden rule. Sixth, a clear distinction must be made between exceeding hours and overtime. Seventh, a lot of information is necessary before and during the introduction of the <b>system.</b> Flexible <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> practically require a form of control. This control, however, should itself be as flexible and as discreet as possible. Self control is to be aimed at. Such a control can be made by a time card, posted or not, by a punch clock, by special individual meter or by computer. To the same extent that flexible <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> <b>system</b> is well accepted by employees, to the same extent does it find obstruction at the middle management level. That the system is applied to middle management is perceived as a move to put them on the same level as blue collar workers. But the basic reluctance of white collars comes from the revised notion of authority required by a flexible <b>hour</b> <b>system.</b> If one group needs particular attention when flexible hours are introduced, it is middle management. Eventhough early reluctance of unions has been greatly dissipated, they still feel that such a system decreases the possibility of human contacts and that the greater responsibility left to the workers is subtle moral constraint. Up to now, flexible hours have been very successful. This is not to say that they are a panacea nor that they will settle all personnel problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the nature of Dutch approach to achieving Work Life Balance (WLB) and to draw policy implications for Japan. It is argued that flexibility of <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and flexibility offered at one's working place are essential elements of WLB. In this respect, the Netherlands has attained relatively advanced policies and practices. For instance, workers in the Netherlands enjoy a strong degree of flexibility in terms of <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> a <b>system</b> that strives to bring actual <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> close to desired <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> Furthermore, the country is currently seeking to increase flexibility for workers in the choice of their place of work through the promotion of telework. First, this paper first positions the Netherlands in a cross-country comparison with other advanced countries—Japan, France, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States —that have adopted different approaches to the labour market and related public policies. Second, the paper presents a theoretical discussion on the flexibility of <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> Third, it focuses on three important aspects of WLB in the Netherlands, namely, part-time work, family-friendly policies, and telework.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{aspects of a}} {{particular}} framework for modeling labor supply {{and the application of}} this approach in practical policy simulation experiments. This modeling framework differs from the standard models of labor supply in that the notion of job choice is fundamental. Specifically, the worker is assumed to have preferences over a latent worker-specific choice set of jobs from which he or she chooses his or her preferred job. A job is characterized with <b>fixed</b> (jobspecific) <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and other non-pecuniary attributes. As a result, observed hours of work are interpreted as the job-specific (fixed) hours of work that is associated with the chosen job. We then show that our framework is practical with respect to applications in empirical analysis and simulation experiments, and is able to produce satisfactory out-of-sample predictions by estimating the model on Norwegian microdata from 1997 and predicting the corresponding microdata from 2003.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to gain a deeper {{understanding}} of how the Chinese prioritize between work and family and how the culture can affect it. Nowadays, availability and work-life balance are often mentioned in a Western context, in this thesis we want to bring it into a Chinese context instead. China has  the largest population in the world but there is not so much previous research in this field. Thus, it was of interest to us to do our research on the work-life balance and availability in China. Chinese culture is strong and plays an important role for the Chinese in their daily lives. In Chinese culture, family relations are important also {{it is not just the}} relationship with the core of the family that is important, but also with the parents or parents- in- law. In this thesis we will show how the Chinese strike a balance between work and family and how they prioritize these two spheres. Other questions that will be dealt with are whether or not the employees of private organizations prioritize differently to the employees of public organizations. We have used a qualitative method and have interviewed ten people from both public and private organizations to gain a deeper understanding. We interviewed both men and women with administrative job. Another criterion was that the respondents had to have a child. We used this criterion since we wanted {{a deeper understanding of}} how they prioritize when they have a child and are still active in working life. The respondents all had fairly much the same conditions when it came to their duties and family situations, but their opinions regarding their work-life balance were different depending on which organization they belonged to. In the analysis and results chapter, you as a reader will notice different factors affecting the respondents priorities between work and family, for an example their living situations, finances and ages of their children. Availability is often connected with the opportunity to have flexible <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> or <b>working</b> from home since it can help you to be available for family and work at the same time. One distinct difference that we noticed is that the respondents from different organizations had different opinions regarding this opportunity.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to study infant feeding practices used by working mothers in Nairobi. Mothers attending clinics at two hospitals, one a private hospital serving higher socioeconomic groups and the other a public hospital represented the low socioeconomic groups, were interviewed. A structured interview was held with 444 mothers (200 from the low socioeconomic group and 244 from the high socioeconomic group) between January 5 th and February 11 th 2000. All mothers with infants aged 16 - 48 weeks who were willing to participate were interviewed. The prevalence of breastfeeding at the time of the study was found to be 94. 1 %. The low socioeconomic group exhibited a higher prevalence of breastfeeding (99 %) with a 10 % difference between the low and high socioeconomic groups. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding was 13. 3 % at three months. Early introduction of other feeding methods was high, with 46. 4 % of the mothers introducing other feeding methods before one month. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors that were associated with exclusive breastfeeding using two separate models for exclusive breastfeeding at one month and two months. The mode of work (<b>fixed</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> as opposed to shift work) was associated with exclusive breastfeeding for at least month (OR= 0. 45) and two months (OR= 0. 39). Insufficient milk and return to work were the main reasons cited for cessation of exclusive breastfeeding. Multiple linear regression was used to find out whether growth rates differed between feeding methods and types of foods for complementary feeding. Bottle-feeding had a significant negative association (- 0. 240, p= 0. 018) with baby weight and a downward trend was evident in baby Z-score for age exhibiting a risk of growth faltering in all infants. The results of this study indicate that the prevalence of breastfeeding in Nairobi Kenya has remained considerably high. Working mothers are still committed to breastfeeding despite the long <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> of separation (mean 46. 23 hours).

40|$|Why do {{taxi drivers}} work when they work? Unlike those {{in many other}} occupations, taxi drivers do not have <b>fixed</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> This raises the {{question}} of what influences their working time. Based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative research conducted in Warsaw between November 2012 and June 2013, this dissertation argues that the working time of Warsaw taxi drivers is anchored in four “temporal structures”: earning time, waiting time, political time and domestic time. First, taxi drivers’ working time is dependent on the demand for their service, which structures their earning time. I argue that, since taxi drivers are coordinating agencies, their earning time is dependent on multiple superior coordination agencies that make up the multi-layered temporal architecture of Warsaw. Such agencies include the religious calendar and the state calendar. Second, taxi drivers’ working time is shaped by a temporal structure of waiting time. I trace the origin of this structure, showing how waiting time is linked to the emergence of capitalism in Poland in 1989. However, while the introduction of capitalism created the structural conditions for waiting time, I argue that waiting time is reproduced every day as taxi drivers have to cope with the uncertainty of demand for their service. Third, taxi drivers’ working time is anchored in political time since they try collectively to improve their working conditions through voice. I distinguish between different forms of voice, showing how and why the political actions of taxi drivers have been largely unsuccessful. Finally, taxi drivers work when they work because of a temporal structure of domestic time. Taxi drivers’ working time is shaped by the temporal order of their family life, which is often in conflict with the rhythm of the market. I describe how the gendered nature of domestic time, characterized by an unequal division of household labour, enables male taxi drivers to work long hours. By providing an explanation for taxi drivers’ working time, which highlights the temporal dimension of social life, this dissertation shows the need for economic sociology to study the impact of time on economic practices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Traditional labor supply {{analysis}} {{is based on}} the assumption that workers only have preferences over consumption and hours of work, and are able to choose consumption and hours freely within the budget constraint. Recently, various discrete choice versions of the traditional approach (with discrete hours) have become popular, but the basic assumption above is still maintained. Neither of these two approaches allows for agents’preferences over qualitative job-specific or choice restrictions facing the agents in the labor market in terms of restricted choice sets of job opportunities.

In the estimation of the model we take into account that the number of options available might vary across work/care combinations, and that some mothers are rationed in the market for care at day care centers. The model is employed to simulate the female labor supply effects of the Norwegian home care allowance reform. female labor supply; child care; discrete choice; microsimulation...|$|R
40|$|Teleworking is an {{alternative}} way to organize work that integrates two sources of competitive advantage: a company's Human Resources and the new Information and Telecommunication Technologies. There is no agreement in literature about teleworking definition and its different meanings. Sometimes, terms such as telecommuting, remote working, and home working are used to explain its different eanings. Teleworking occurs when employees perform all or {{a substantial part of}} their work physically separated from the location of their employer, using IT for operation and communication (Baruch, 2001). Davenport and Pearlson (1998) introduce teleworking as {{an alternative}} mode of work, enabled by technological improvements and increase in use of information technology (IT) on the one hand, and on the other hand, by an unconventional managerial approach, which takes it that work is what you do, not a place where you go. Three main types of teleworking are usually found in operation: home-based telework, satellite offices, and mobile working. Home-based teleworking refers to employees who work at home on a regular basis, though not necessarily every day. A person can be considered as a teleworker if her telecommunications link to the office is as simple as a telephone; however, teleworkers often use other communications media such as electronic mail and personal computer links to office servers. Self- employed workers and workers who have no connection to a central workplace are not considered as teleworkers. In satellite offices, employees work both outside the home and away from the normal workplace in a location convenient to the employees and/or customers to reduce commuting time. Other category of teleworkers is the mobile workers. The mobile workers are frequently on the road, using ommunications technology to work from home, from a car, from a plane, or from a hotel - communicating with the office as necessary from each location. Salespersons and investment bankers are examples of mobile teleworkers. The development of teleworking started in the 1970 s. Teleworking is commonly used in many industries such as IT, telecommunication, insurance, construction and manufacturing. In Sri Lanka, teleworking is still an emerging concept compared to most of the other countries. Software industry is an emerging industry in Sri Lanka and there are many multinational companies operating in Sri Lanka. These companies are experiencing different types of work patterns such as flexible <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> shift <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and occasional teleworking. Sri Lankan IT industry has developed upto a considerable level to compete with many industry giants compared to other industries in Sri Lanka. It is in a good position to employ new practices in order to enhance the performance. In the Sri Lankan context, software industry {{may be one of the}} possible industries in which teleworking can be implemented due to its nature and information and communication technology capabilities of employees. But still, no major research has been conducted to investigate the adoption feasibility of teleworking in Sri Lankan software industry. The objective of this research is to examine the viability of teleworking in software industry in Sri Lanka. Many factors related to the software industry are well understood by the employees of the industry. Thus, this study attempts to investigate the perception of employees on teleworking...|$|R
