40|$|Academic {{libraries}} are, {{because of}} the age demographics of the librarian workforce, facing an organizational dilemma. Stated most simply the dilemma is: Academic libraries need to exploit new technologies using new service strategies to be effective. They will need to do so with a librarian labor force that consists {{of a large number}} of baby boomers many of whom will remain in the workforce for at least another decade. At the same time millennium librarians, who will replace the baby boomers, need to be attracted and provided an environment that will allow them to develop and grow, and that will productively use their skills and expertise. It will be important that both groups be productive and make contributions, but creating an organization with a structure and culture to do both will be difficult because in many cases aspirations and needs of the two groups will differ and be at cross purposes. These two imperatives, keeping baby boomer librarians productive and providing millennium librarians opportunities to grow and develop can be accomplished simultaneously, but not without creatively thinking about the libraries organizational structure and attention to its culture.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to look at this {{apparent}} increase in demand for fire protection services in the theoretical framework of derived demand. The theory of derived demand tells us that the demand for labor in a certain field is determined by the demand for the goods or services produced by that labor (Freeman, 1972). More specifically, we should expect to see a shift to the right of the demand curve for fire fighters from the increased demand for fire protection services since September Eleventh. This should lead to greater employment levels and higher wages in the labor market for fire fighters. Section II gives the background of the increased demand for fire protection services since September Eleventh. Section III will follow by presenting the theory of derived demand. This will set up the hypothesis that employment numbers and wages for fire fighters should have increased after September Eleventh from the increased demand for fire protection services. Section IV <b>will</b> <b>layout</b> <b>the</b> model and data that will be used to test this hypothesis and Section V will examine the results obtained by testing our model so that we can draw conclusions and policy implications from them.

40|$|Abenomics is a {{term that}} encapsulates the current fiscal, monetary, and {{structural}} policies that the Central Bank of Japan and the Japanese Government are jointly pursuing {{in an effort to}} reinvigorate the economy under the tenure of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. This research paper is dual-focused. First, it <b>will</b> <b>layout</b> <b>the</b> policies that Japan is undertaking in pursuit of these measures. Towards that end, it will delve into the specific methodologies that the Central Bank of Japan and the Japanese Government are pursuing to stimulate the economy. The paper will explain the specific measures that are being pursued, and explain the dramatic implications of such pursuits. We will then opine on both the results and the broader implications going forward from an economic point of view. After the financial implications are explained, we will shift to the ethical implications of such policy measures. Evaluating Abenomics under Normative, Utilitarian, and Rights-based Approaches will lead to varying conclusions as to the ethicality of such pursuits. The findings on both of these fronts will be evaluated, and the implications going further will be assessed. Given the relatively new implementation of Abenomics, there has not been extensive research done on the economic significance of the policy, although there has been some that is still in its working-paper stages. With respect to the ethical implications, there have not been any substantive academic papers published. This research attempts to explore what has, up to now, been unchartered territory. The central research question that this paper intends to answer is to what extent Abenomics can impact substantive economic change and to what extent are the measures being pursued ethical...|$|R
40|$|The {{exploration}} of deep space presents {{a variety of}} significant control challenges. Long communication delays coupled with challenging new science objectives require high levels of system autonomy and increasingly demanding pointing and control capabilities. Historically, missions based {{on the use of}} a large single spacecraft have been successful and popular {{since the early days of}} NASA. However, these large spacecraft missions are currently being displaced by more frequent and more focused missions based on the use of smaller and less expensive spacecraft designs. This trend drives the need to design smart software and good algorithms which together with the miniaturization of control components will improve performance while replacing the heavier and more expensive hardware used in the past. NASA's future space exploration will also include mission types that have never been attempted before, posing significant challenges to the underlying control system. This includes controlled landing on small bodies (e. g., asteroids and comets), sample return missions (where samples are brought back from other planets), robotic {{exploration of}} planetary surfaces (e. g., intelligent rovers), high precision formation flying, and deep space optical interferometry, While the control of planetary spacecraft for traditional flyby and orbiter missions are based on well-understood methodologies, control approaches for many future missions will be fundamentally different. This paradigm shift will require completely new control system development approaches, system architectures, and much greater levels of system autonomy to meet expected performance in the presence of significant environmental disturbances, and plant uncertainties. This paper will trace the motivation for these changes and <b>will</b> <b>layout</b> <b>the</b> approach taken to meet the new challenges.
