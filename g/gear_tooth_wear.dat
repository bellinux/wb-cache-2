40|$|As one of {{the most}} common gear failure modes, tooth wear can produce {{nonlinear}} modulation sidebands in the vibration frequency spectrum. However, limited research has been reported in monitoring the gear wear based on vibration due to the lack of tools which can effectively extract the small sidebands. In order to accurately monitor gear wear progression in a timely fashion, this paper presents a gear wear condition monitoring approach based on vibration signal analysis using the modulation signal bispectrum-based sideband estimator (MSB-SE) method. The vibration signals are collected using a run-to-failure test of gearbox under an accelerated test process. MSB analysis was performed on the vibration signals to extract the sideband information. Using a combination of the peak value of MSB-SE and the coherence of MSB-SE, the overall information of gear transmission system can be obtained. Based on the amplitude of MSB-SE peaks, a dimensionless indicator is proposed to assess the effects of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>wear.</b> The results demonstrated that the proposed indicator can be used to accurately and reliably monitor <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> and evaluate the wear severity...|$|E
40|$|A {{coal-fired}} power plant operating in the western United States was experiencing short gearbox life in its coal pulverizing operation. The AGMA 6 EP (ISO 320) gear oil recommended by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) failed to provide adequate lubrication and protection based on oil analysis results and gearbox inspection after one year of operation. This was confirmed by excessive wear metals and lower viscosity in the used oil reports. Further analysis of the used extreme pressure (EP) gear oil indicated excessive buildup of particulate contaminants in the lubricant and depletion of the EP additive package.

40|$|Abstract—Recently, {{the issue}} of machine {{condition}} monitoring and fault diagnosis {{as a part of}} maintenance system became global due to the potential advantages to be gained from reduced maintenance costs, improved productivity and increased machine availability. The aim of this work is to investigate the effectiveness of a new fault diagnosis method based on power spectral density (PSD) of vibration signals in combination with decision trees and fuzzy inference system (FIS). To this end, a series of studies was conducted on an external gear hydraulic pump.

The purpose {{of this research is}} to use artificial neural network (ANN) computational modelling to correlate spur gear data from acoustic emissions, lubricant temperature, and specific film thickness (). The approach is using an algorithm to monitor the oil film thickness and to detect which lubrication regime the gearbox is running either hydrodynamic, elastohydrodynamic, or boundary. This monitoring can aid identification of fault development. Feed-forward and recurrent Elman neural network algorithms were used to develop ANN models, which are subjected to training, testing, and validation process. The Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation algorithm was applied to reduce errors. Log-sigmoid and Purelin were identified as suitable transfer functions for hidden and output nodes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for quantifying the wear or damage of gear teeth in a transmission system. The procedure developed {{in this study}} can be applied {{as a part of}} either an onboard machine health-monitoring system or a health diagnostic system used during regular maintenance. As the developed methodology is based on analysis of gearbox vibration under normal operating conditions, no shutdown or special modification of operating parameters is required during the diagnostic process. The process of quantifying the wear or damage of gear teeth requires a set of measured vibration data and a model of the gear mesh dynamics. An optimization problem is formulated to determine the profile of a time-varying mesh stiffness parameter for which the model output approximates the measured data. The resulting stiffness profile is then related to the level of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> or damage.

A gear tooth fault model is developed to simulate the effects of pitting and wear on the vibration signal under normal operating conditions. The model uses changes in the gear mesh stiffness to simulate the effects of gear tooth faults. The overall dynamics of the gear transmission system is evaluated by coupling the dynamics of each individual gear-rotor system through gear mesh forces generated between each gear-rotor system and the bearing forces generated between the rotor and the gearbox structure. The predicted results were compared with experimental results obtained from a spiral bevel gear fatigue test rig at NASA Lewis Research Center. The Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) was used to give a comprehensive comparison of the predicted and experimental results. The WVD method applied to the experimental results were also compared to other fault detection techniques to verify the WVD's ability to detect the pitting damage, and to determine its relative performance.

40|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>tooth</b> surface <b>wear</b> is {{a common}} failure mode. It occurs over {{relatively}} long periods of service nonetheless, it degrades operating efficiency and leads to other major failures such as excessive tooth removal and catastrophic breakage. To develop accurate wear detection and diagnosis approaches at the early phase of the wear, this paper examines the gear dynamic responses from both experimental and numerical studies with increasing extents of <b>wear</b> on <b>tooth</b> contact surfaces. An experimental test facility comprising of a back-to-back two-stage helical gearbox arrangement was used in a run-to-failure test, in which variable sinusoidal and step increment loads along with variable speeds were applied and gear wear was allowed to progress naturally. A comprehensive dynamic model was also developed to study the influence of surface wear on gear dynamic response, with the inclusion of time-varying stiffness and tooth friction based on elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) principles. The model consists of an 18 degree of freedom (DOF) vibration system, which includes {{the effects of the}} supporting bearings, driving motor and loading system. It also couples the transverse and torsional motions resulting from time-varying friction forces, time varying mesh stiffness and the excitation of different wear severities. Vibration signatures due to <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> severity and frictional excitations were acquired for the parameter determination and the validation of the model with the experimental results. The experimental test and numerical model results show clearly correlated behaviour, over different gear sizes and geometries. The spectral peaks at the meshing frequency components along with their sidebands were used to examine the response patterns due to wear. The paper concludes that the mesh vibration amplitudes of the second and third harmonics as well as the sideband components increase considerably with the extent of wear and hence these can be used as effective features for fault detection and diagnosis...|$|R

A questionnaire was administered to assess awareness and habits related to <b>tooth</b> <b>wear,</b> and <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> measured clinically. The {{data were analyzed using}} SPSS version 13 and statistical level of significance was p < 0. 05. RESULTS Overall 39. 1 % of subjects were aware on <b>tooth</b> <b>wear.</b> Awareness on causes and outcome was 39. 5 % and 26. 4 % respectively. Risk habits to <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> most frequently reported include unilateral chewing, chewing bones, and use of citrus fruits respectively. More females reported risk habits than males. Thirty percent of respondents using horizontal movement to brush their teeth and few (7. 6 %) reported using excessive force during brushing. The prevalence of <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> was 41. 8 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{to develop}} a <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> index capable of objectively {{classifying}} and quantifying the progression of <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> using accurate 3 D scanning data of <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> in patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: a 3 D <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> scanning protocol, aimed at in-vivo monitoring of <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> progression, was developed and assessed using a calibrated reference model. The methodology involved taking polyether impressions of the dentition, pouring impressions in Type IV stone and scanning the resultant casts using a 3 D contact-scanner. Thereafter, eleven <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> patients were recruited (n= 130 teeth) with participants’ dentitions scanned initially and after twelve months. The resultant 3 D scan data, demonstrating depth, surface area and distribution of <b>tooth</b> <b>wear,</b> were analysed and employed to formulate a novel 3 D <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> index. RESULTS: all study-participants demonstrated ≥ 140 µm of <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> {{over a period of}} twelve months. All participants had one or more teeth with ≥ 260 µm <b>tooth</b> <b>wear.</b> However, the wear affected surface area was ≤ 4 % in the majority of scanned teeth (n= 104 / 130). Based on clinical data, the proposed 3 D scanning index classifies <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> according to depth (Grade 1 : 140 – 260 µm, Grade 2 : 260 – 380 µm and Grade 3 : 380 - > 500 µm), surface area (Class A: 0 - 4 %, Class B: 4 - 8 % and Class C: ≥ 8 %), and distribution (Localised tooth wear: affecting ≤ 30 % of teeth with Grade 1 or more wear-depth. Generalised tooth wear: affecting > 30 % of teeth with Grade 1 or more wear-depth). CONCLUSION: the proposed <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> index offers an objective means to clinically assess and monitor <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> progression in patients using quantitative 3 D scan data acquired through a standardised, calibrated and repeatable scanning protocol...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a general}} {{perception}} {{that the problem of}} <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> is increasing due to elements of the modern diet and due to increased retention of dentition into older age. <b>Tooth</b> <b>wear</b> encompasses erosion, abrasion and attrition of dental tissues – these often co-exist – yet in general, erosion is of more significance to the young and attrition is of more significance to the older population. Diet plays {{a significant role in the}} aetiology of <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> and likewise advanced <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> in older age may impose dietary restrictions with consequences for dietary intake and nutritional status. There is a need to increase the awareness of the disease of <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> and the associated nutritional problems. At present, the aetiology of <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> is poorly understood – especially with respect to the role of diet. Clearer information on how best to measure and monitor the incidence and prevalence is needed in order to obtain longitudinal data on trends in <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> and to monitor the factors that contribute to this condition. These issues will be addressed in the following presentations: 1) What is <b>tooth</b> <b>wear?</b> Aetiology, measurement and monitoring, 2) The role of diet in the aetiology of dental erosion, 3) Groups at increased risk of tooth wear: Eating disorders, ‘dieters 2 ̆ 7 sportsmen and those with impairments, 4) <b>Tooth</b> <b>wear</b> in older adults: nutritional implications. In summary this symposium seeks to: 1) increase awareness of the disease of <b>tooth</b> <b>wear,</b> and its associated nutritional problems 2) increase understanding of the aetiology of <b>tooth</b> <b>wear,</b> especially the dietary role, 3) provide information on how to measure and monitor <b>tooth</b> <b>wear,</b> 4) highlight future research requirements in the area of <b>tooth</b> <b>wear</b> and diet...|$|R

The main reason of the dehiscence spalling in the <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> was the presentation of fissuary. The fissuraing expanded and developed under the alternating stress to the <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> surface layer spalling.
