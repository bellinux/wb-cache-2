50|$|Although it is {{impossible}} to see or make 4-dimensional objects, it is possible to map them into lower dimensions to get some impressions of them. An analogy for converting the 4-D 24-cell into its 3-D sculpture is cartographic projection, where the surface of the 3-D Earth (or a globe) is reduced to a flat 2-D plane (a portable map). This is done either with light 'casting a shadow' from the globe onto the map or with some mathematical transformation. Many different types of map projection exist: the familiar rectangular Mercator (used for navigation), the circular <b>gnomonic</b> (first <b>projection</b> invented), and several others. All of them have limitations in that they show some features in a distorted manner—'you can't flatten an orange peel without damaging it'—but they are useful visual aids and convenient references.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to develop and {{validate}} a computerized model for an energy? efficient fenestration system that can easily be incorporated into the architectural design process. This model is for the thermal analysis of a shaded fenestration system and considers selected effects of the solar shades. Several simulation programs have been developed for the thermal analysis of a shaded window system. However, none of the previous programs has incorporated a validated simulation model into a visually effective display such as a sunpath diagram. The proposed methodology concentrates on the development of various new graphical aids tor effectively displaying a shaded design and develops a thermal model for calculating the heat transfer through an unshaded window at any orientation. A computerized simulation model, called the Shaded Fenestration Design (SFD) model, was developed that is capable of calculating the amount of solar radiation for a clear day as well as calculating the heat transfer through window glazing. The SFD model also provides new computerized displays of the sunpath diagrams that include the equidistant, orthographic, stereographic, <b>gnomonic,</b> and cylindrical <b>projections,</b> as well as the accompanying shading mask protractors. The program simulates clear sky solar radiation for locations in the U. S. using the methods developed by the ASHRAE Handbook, Duffie and Beckman, and Kreider and Rabl. An anisotrophic sky model was applied for the calculation of solar radiation on a tilted surface and the transmitted solar radiation through the single-glazed window. A highly insulated experimental test box was constructed to measure the total heat gain through the window glazing as well as the amount of solar radiation on the vertical surface. A finite difference model was then developed to provide a comparative validation. The results from the proposed solar simulation model were also compared against the simulated results from the DOE- 2 program. The portions of the work that represent new contributions include: l) computerization of the four projection methods (i. e. ? orthographic. stereographic. <b>gnomonic.</b> and cylindrical <b>projections)</b> for the sunpath diagram and the shading mask protractor, 2) display of the hourly intensity of solar data onto the path of the sun for horizontal and vertical orientations at varying off-south azimuths, 3) use of a moveable viewpoint for the sunpath diagram, and 4) development of experimental test sets of the measured heat gain for various shading configurations...|$|R

50|$|An orthographic {{projection}} map is a map projection of cartography.

5000|$|In spherical geometry, {{projection}} of a sphere upon a plane {{was used by}} Ptolemy (~150) in his Planisphaerium. The method is called stereographic projection and uses a plane tangent to a sphere and a pole C diametrically opposite the point of tangency. Any point P on the sphere besides C determines a line CP intersecting the plane at the projected point for P. The correspondence makes the sphere a one-point compactification for the plane when a point at infinity is included to correspond to C, which otherwise has no projection on the plane. A common instance is the complex plane where the compactification corresponds to the Riemann sphere. Alternatively, a hemisphere is frequently projected onto a plane using the <b>gnomonic</b> <b>projection.</b>|$|E

A proponent of Mechanism, his Discours de la Connaissance des Bestes (Paris, 1672) combatted Descartes's views on animals, but did so so weakly that many looked on it as a covert defence rather than a refutation, an impression which Pardies himself afterwards endeavoured to destroy. His Elémens de Géométrie (Paris, 1671) was translated into Latin and English. He left in manuscript a work entitled Art de la Guerre and a celestial atlas comprising six charts, published after his death (Paris, 1673-74). His collected mathematical and physical works were published in French (The Hague, 1691) and in Latin (Amsterdam, 1694). He {{was a member of the}} academy of anatomist Pierre Michon Bourdelot.In 1674, Pardies published the star atlas Globi coelestis in tabulas planas redacti descriptio in Paris. The atlas was partially based on the work of another French Jesuit scientist Thomas Gouye. The atlas was engraved by G. Vallet and dedicated to Johan Friedrich, Duke of Braunschweig-Luneburg. The constellation figures are drawn from Uranometria, but they were carefully reworked and adapted to a broader view of the sky. In 1693, a newer edition was published and in 1700 another edition appeared. They include new information, such as the paths of comets observed since 1674. The atlas uses <b>gnomonic</b> <b>projection</b> so that the plates make up a cube of the universe. The atlas served as a model for the star charts of William Rutter Dawes published in 1844.|$|E
