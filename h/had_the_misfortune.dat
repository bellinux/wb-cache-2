5|$|At {{the end of}} the English Civil War Lady Drake {{was joined}} at her Devon home, Ash House in the parish of Musbury, by her fourth {{daughter}} Elizabeth Drake and her husband Winston Churchill (1620–1688), a Royalist cavalry captain. Unlike his mother-in-law who had supported the Parliamentary cause, Winston <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>misfortune</b> of fighting on the losing side of the war – for which he, like so many other Cavaliers, was forced to compound; in his case £446 18s. Although Winston had paid off the fine by 1651, it had impoverished him. From this episode may derive the Churchill family motto: Fiel Pero Desdichado ("Faithful but Unfortunate").|$|E
5|$|Meade {{had his own}} detractors as well. Similar to the {{situation}} with Lee, Meade suffered partisan attacks about his performance at Gettysburg, but he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>misfortune</b> of experiencing them in person. Supporters of his predecessor, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, lambasted Meade before the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, where Radical Republicans suspected that Meade was a Copperhead and {{tried in vain to}} relieve him from command. Daniel E. Sickles and Daniel Butterfield accused Meade of planning to retreat from Gettysburg during the battle. Most politicians, including Lincoln, criticized Meade for what they considered to be his half-hearted pursuit of Lee after the battle. A number of Meade's most competent subordinates—Winfield S. Hancock, John Gibbon, Gouverneur K. Warren, and Henry J. Hunt, all heroes of the battle—defended Meade in print, but Meade was embittered by the overall experience.|$|E
5|$|The 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment was {{the second}} American {{airborne}} unit to land after the 507th, {{under the command of}} Colonel James Coutts. En route to the drop zone, the transport aircraft carrying the 513th <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>misfortune</b> to pass through a belt of German antiaircraft weapons, losing 22 of the C-46 transport aircraft and damaging a further 38. Just as the 507th had, the 513th also suffered from pilot error due to the ground haze, and as such the regiment actually missed its designated drop zone, DZX, and was dropped on one of the landing zones designated for the British 6th Airlanding Brigade. Despite this inaccuracy the paratroopers swiftly rallied and aided the British glider-borne troops who were landing simultaneously, eliminating several German artillery batteries that were covering the area. Once the German troops in the area had been eliminated, a combined force of American and British airborne troops stormed Hamminkeln and secured the town. By 2pm, Colonel Coutts reported to Divisional Headquarters that the 513th Parachute Infantry had secured all of its objectives, having knocked out two tanks and two complete regiments of artillery during their assault. During its attempts to secure its objectives, the regiment also gained a third Medal of Honor for the 17th Airborne Division when Private First Class Stuart Stryker posthumously received the award after leading a charge against a German machine-gun nest, creating a distraction to allow the rest of his platoon to capture the fortified position in which the machine-gun was situated.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} Test, England batted first on a pitch dead after recent rain to reach 172.

It was a game decided by the toss and the rain: and ended with an English victory at 1.52pm (before lunch) on the second day.|$|E

During a playoff series, Luque wanted McDuffie to start on two days' rest, but McDuffie refused saying his arm was sore. Once the enraged manager returned {{to the locker room}} from his adjacent office waving a loaded pistol and pointed it at the pitcher, McDuffie quickly changed his mind, went out and fired a two-hitter game.|$|E

25|$|He {{played in}} four matches for Lancashire in 1874. Moving to Yorkshire {{he played for}} his adopted county from 1878 to 1882 without much success.

In 1879, he took 119 wickets for the Gentlemen of Yorkshire but, in his first-class cricket only two wickets at 71.50 each. In fifteen first-class matches in all, he scored 172 runs at 7.27, and took eight catches.|$|E
25|$|Viola players {{began the}} 1970s decade with Scudetto sewed on their breast, but the period was not {{especially}} fruitful for the team. After a fifth-place finish in 1971, they finished in mid-table almost every year, even flirting with relegation in 1972 and 1978. The Viola did win the Anglo-Italian League Cup in 1974 {{and won the}} Coppa Italia again in 1975. The team consisted of young talents like Vincenzo Guerini and Moreno Roggi, who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>misfortune</b> to suffer bad injuries, and above all Giancarlo Antognoni, who would later become an idol to Fiorentina's fans. The young {{average age of the}} players led to the team being called Fiorentina Ye-Ye.|$|E
25|$|Lowe's first outing {{was at the}} First Battle of Bull Run, with General Irvin McDowell and the Army of Northeastern Virginia.

They returned to Fort Corcoran to report his position. Eventually his wife Leontine, disguised as an old hag, came to his rescue with a buckboard and canvas covers and was able to extract him and his equipment safely.|$|E
