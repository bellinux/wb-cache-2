40|$|Garlic is a semi-perishable {{vegetable}} spice {{and nearly}} 30 % {{of the crop}} is wasted due to respiration and microbiological spoilage during storage. Through garlic is produced abundantly and consumed as such, little efforts have so far been made to produce dehydrated garlic and garlic powder. The proper drying techniques {{are the most important}} aspect of fruits and vegetables preservation. The use of solar dryer helps not only to reduce losses and improves the quality of product but also helps in conserving the convectional energy sources. A greenhouse type solar dryer was used the experiments were conducted to develop dehydrated <b>garlic</b> <b>slices</b> so as to enhance the availability of <b>garlic</b> <b>slices</b> during off season. In the present study, fresh <b>garlic</b> <b>slices</b> were pretreated in two ways (i) KMS treated samples (ii) NaCl treated samples (ratio of water 1 : 4 w/w) and untreated <b>garlic</b> <b>slices</b> were also dried as control samples.

Physico-chemical analysis i. e. moisture content, moisture ratio, drying rate, ascorbic acid, acidity, total sugar, reducing sugar, colour, and pungency were evaluated during the experiment. Experiments were also conducted to study the effect of drying conditions on sensory quality and rehydration characteristics.

40|$|AbstractMoxibustion therapy chiefly {{utilizes}} {{heat generated}} by the combustion of moxa. Therefore, understanding the thermal properties of moxibustion is essential when studying the mechanisms involved in moxibustion therapy. Therefore, we measured temperatures of direct and indirect moxibustion. For indirect moxibustion, moxibustion on garlic was used. To {{determine the influence of}} the environment on moxibustion, we applied airflow of 0. 0 - 0. 8 m/s. An increase in the airflow caused a concomitant increase in the maximum temperature of direct moxibustion, from 160 to 300 °C and the time duration was reduced by half. However, the maximum temperature of indirect moxibustion demonstrated the opposite effect, with the temperature decreasing from 45 to 40 °C. This is attributed to the upstream airflow, which indicates the importance of the air inside moxa. For indirect moxibustion using <b>garlic</b> <b>slices</b> of different thicknesses, we found the optimum condition for the buffer layer of a garlic slice. The maximum number of consecutive moxibustions using one garlic slice was three. These results are consistent with traditional methods. This observation illustrates that the importance of <b>garlic</b> <b>slices</b> in modulating the combustion heat and proper thermal stimulus to the patient...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Moxibustion {{has been}} a part of {{acupuncture}} practice for thousands of years. Traditionally, it includes direct moxibustion, in which moxa sticks are burned at acupuncture points on the skin, and indirect moxibustion, in which monkshood cakes or ginger or <b>garlic</b> <b>slices</b> are used to insulate the skin from burning moxa cones. Recently randomised clinical trials and clinical observations suggest that moxibustion can enhance physiological and immune functions, but there has been little investigation of the scientific basis of these traditional techniques. The present study compared the infrared radiation caused by these techniques to that of non-specific controls and to that of the human body surface at an acupuncture point. Methods: A highly sensitive, infrared-spectrum detection device was used to compare the spectra of traditional moxibustion materials (n = 4 /group) with those of control materials (n = 4 /group) and to the spectrum at the surface of an acupuncture point LI 4 (Hegu) in healthy volunteers (n = 7). Results: (1) The infrared radiation intensity produced by a traditional moxa stick was 43300. 41 mV, with a peak on the infrared spectrum of 3. 5 μm, while the respective radiation intensities of two controls, a smokeless moxa stick and a 555 cigarette, were 31. 15 mV and 37. 03 mV with peaks of 7 μm and 3. 5 μm. (2) The infrared radiation intensities of the three traditional media of indirect moxibustion, monkshood cake, ginger slices and <b>garlic</b> <b>slices,</b> were 520. 27 mV, 594. 79 mV and 681. 87 mV, respectively, all with peaks around 7. 5 μm and similar spectra. In contrast, the infrared radiation intensities of slices of cucumber and carrot, used as control media for indirect moxibustion, were 274. 47 mV and 50. 53 mV, respectively, substantially different from those of the traditional media. (3) Infrared radiation at LI 4 (Hegu) was 20. 40 mV, and peaked on the infrared spectrum at about 7. 5 μm. The experiment showed that the thermal action of the traditional moxa stick was more potent than that of indirect moxibustion and its radiation peak was different from that at the acupuncture point on the human body. In contrast, the thermal action of traditional indirect moxibustion was modest and its radiation peak matched that at the acupuncture point. Conclusion: Direct moxibustion with a traditional moxa stick may produce its potent therapeutic effects by thermal action, while traditional indirect moxibustion may act by producing modest thermal action and a sympathetic vibration at the skin surface. Non-traditional thermal materials and media may not be suitable substitutes for traditional materials. The data provide a scientific, biophysical rationale for traditional moxibustion. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
