And we all held up {{pictures}} in the writer's room. We wrote one scene and I offered it to him {{so that was a}} happy accident. And then Brooke Smith just auditioned [...] and that was a happy accident. I do think it came together in a weird tribute to many things but that was all by accident." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know but}} they might,' he replied, wiping the {{moisture}} from his white face. 'People say such things. How <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> now?' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> for a companion? [...] No, no, don't think it. [...] He doesn't {{know he is}} alone; [...] Isolation is his birthright, [...] This atom.|$|E
60|$|When {{this was}} <b>done</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> inquiringly at Nat. The other nodded.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Howel complied, {{and when}} <b>he</b> had <b>done,</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> expectingly at the lady.|$|R
6000|$|Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> so {{into her}} eyes? Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> {{not speak to}} her? Could it be that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> for her {{to make the first}} sign? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't stand {{much more}} of this," [...] {{exploded}} Flambeau. [...] "Who is this fellow? What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> like? What is the usual get-up of a mentally invisible man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But where shall I find God?" [...] insisted Tarzan. [...] "You {{are very}} old; {{if there is}} a God you must have seen Him. What <b>does</b> <b>He</b> <b>look</b> like? Where does He live?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no good talking," [...] said Rachel; [...] "but {{when they}} say that he's afraid to show himself in Baslehurst, I don't believe them. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> like a man afraid to show himself?" ...|$|E
60|$|And perplexed enough <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> at {{the sight}} of his {{prostrate}} file of patients, plunged, apparently, in such unaccountable slumbers.|$|R
5000|$|Charles Lamb in the Essays of Elia says of Thomas Coventry that [...] "nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> or walk worth a moidore less." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Er--Will--held Duncan pretty tight--didn't you? He's a {{hard one}} to fool, too. Never {{suspected}} a mite, <b>did</b> <b>he?</b> <b>Look</b> out for your watch!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Cuss him!' Dick said to me, and I {{could see}} his hold on his rifle tighten, 'what <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> at Queen May like that for? You mark my words, Abe, trouble will come of this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All night I waited!" [...] he cried. [...] "I {{could not}} sit still. I could {{scarcely}} breathe. Tell {{me what he}} is like, Julia? Tell me what he looks like? Is he strong? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> strong enough for the work?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Zopyr. [...] What[!] {{you know}} it too? [...] Then I may laugh;--oh, what relief is this! [...] How <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look,</b> the courtiers {{gathering}} round? [...] Does he hang down his head, & his ears too? [...] Oh, I shall die! (laughs.) ...|$|E
60|$|Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> so melancholy? {{the ladies}} asked {{of one another}} when they withdrew. In after days they remembered his pale face.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, you {{interest}} me indescribably. <b>Do</b> you suppose <b>he</b> {{was in our}} rank of life? I mean, of course, <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> like a gentleman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so {{like a man}} and {{so unlike}} a woman. What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> say? What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> How <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look?</b> What <b>did</b> you say? What did you do? How did you look?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Does he {{remind you}} of {{the figure of the}} man you saw come out of the mews?" [...] Lord Fawn paused. [...] "We can't make him move about here as we did in Mr. Wickerby's room; but remembering that as you must do, <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> like the man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, I fancy that Major Oakshott is {{a bitter}} Puritan {{in his own}} house; but no {{discipline}} could be too harsh for such a boy as that, according to all that I hear," [...] said her ladyship, [...] "nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> as if much were amiss with him so far as may be judged of features so strange and writhen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{how does}} he say it? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> you in the face? A boy of that kind may lie. Boys do--and girls also. When people say they don't, they know nothing about it; but if it's worth one's while {{to look at them}} one can {{generally}} tell when they're lying. I'm not a bit afraid of a boy when he is lying,--but only of one who can lie as though he didn't lie." ...|$|E
60|$|When he had {{finished}} reading, Chauvelin quietly folded the paper up again, and then only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> at {{the man and the}} woman before him.|$|R
6000|$|I:3:9 [...] SOL. [...] Thus <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look,</b> thus speak, [...] When to {{my heart}} he clung, and I to him [...] Breathed my first love--and last.|$|R
6000|$|As {{this was}} {{precisely}} what Beetle had <b>done</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> hurt but forgiving. 'We will attend to this later,' said King. 'Go on, Winton, and retrieve yourself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really!" [...] she said. [...] "You've {{done all}} those things!" [...] And she {{scrutinized}} Alvina's face. [...] "You've had some effect on him, that's evident," [...] she said. Then she shuddered, and dabbed her nose with her handkerchief. [...] "Oh, the flesh is a beastly thing!" [...] she cried. [...] "To {{make a man}} howl outside there like that, because you're here. And to make me howl because I've got a child inside me. It's unbearable! What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> like, really?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{told him}} the whole truth; the case against us--the facts as we knew them. Then I added, slowly, 'This is Mr. Harold Tillington, whom they accuse of forgery. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> like a forger? I want to marry him before he is tried. It {{is the only way}} by which I can prove my {{implicit}} trust in him. As soon as we are married, he will give himself up at once to the police--if you wish it, before your eyes. But married we must be. Can't you manage it somehow?' ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Snagsby screws a watchful glance on Jo as he {{is brought}} into the little drawing-room by Guster. He looks at Mr. Snagsby the moment he comes in. Aha! Why <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> at Mr. Snagsby? Mr. Snagsby looks at him. Why should he do that, but that Mrs. Snagsby sees it all? Why else should that look pass between them, why else should Mr. Snagsby be {{confused}} and cough a signal cough behind his hand? It is as clear as crystal that Mr. Snagsby is that boy's father.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He married! The Lord so 's, {{what shall}} we hear next? <b>Do</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> married now? His are not the abashed eyes and lips of a married man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' said Elizabeth, {{her eyes}} beaming with pleasure; 'I {{am sure that}} was very kind of you. And how <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look,</b> poor little fellow, and what <b>did</b> <b>he</b> say, and was not he delighted to see you?' ...|$|R
50|$|Tsebelis {{then looks}} at how various veto players resolve certain {{situation}} (changing the number of policy dimensions, veto players and status quo points). In so <b>doing</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> at situations with many solutions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ma nun me lasciar'--!" [...] she murmured, {{repeating the}} music. [...] "That means--Don't leave me! Don't leave me! But why? Why shouldn't one human being go away from another? What does it mean? That awful noise! Isn't love {{the most horrible}} thing! I think it's horrible. It just does one in, and turns one {{into a sort of}} howling animal. I'm howling with one sort of pain, he's howling with another. Two hellish animals howling through the night! I'm not myself, he's not himself. Oh, I think it's horrible. What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> like, Nurse? Is he beautiful? Is he a great hefty brute?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I bowed low to his Majesty, {{and stepped}} out into the hall. Apparently my obeisance did not come up to Egyptian {{standards}} of courtesy, for a suppressed titter broke audibly from the ranks of bronze-skinned waiting-women. But the king graciously smiled at my attempt, and turning to the nearest nobleman, observed in a voice of great sweetness and self-contained majesty: [...] "This stranger, Ombos, is certainly a very curious person. His appearance does not at all resemble that of an Ethiopian or other savage, nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> like the pale-faced sailors who come to us from the Achaian land beyond the sea. His features, to be sure, are not very different from theirs; but his extraordinary and singularly inartistic dress shows him to belong to some other barbaric race." ...|$|E
6000|$|Such is the {{relation}} of Biology to those sciences which deal with objects having fewer properties than itself. But as the student, in reaching Biology, looks back upon sciences of a less complex and therefore more perfect nature; so, on the other hand, <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> forward to other more complex and less perfect branches of knowledge. Biology deals only with living beings as isolated things--treats only {{of the life of}} the individual: but there is a higher division of science still, which considers living beings as aggregates--which deals with {{the relation}} of living beings one to another--the science which observes men--whose experiments are made by nations one upon another, in battle-fields--whose general propositions are embodied in history, morality, and religion--whose deductions lead to our happiness or our misery,--and whose verifications so often come too late, and serve only ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was just}} time to {{complete}} this discreet arrangement, before the stranger reached the lodge. He {{took off his hat}} to Miss Garth politely, as she turned round. What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> like, on the face of him? <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> like a clergyman in difficulties.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I am so happy, and so thankful. My sweet bairn! Where did {{you find}} him? How did you rescue him? I felt sure you would do it. How <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> when <b>he</b> saw you? and--" ...|$|R
60|$|Taken aback, Tyler {{hesitated for}} a second, whilst Crispin waited with hand outstretched. Vainly <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>look</b> round for sign or word of help or counsel. None was afforded him by his fellow-revellers, who one and all hung back in silence.|$|R
