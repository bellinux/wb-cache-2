40|$|Current {{regulations}} for diesel exhaust emissions cannot {{be met by}} engine improvements alone, {{and for this reason}} the diesel particulate filter (DPF) is a widely used aftertreatment component for the control of diesel particulate matter (PM). The DPF functions by trapping PM and destroying it by oxidation. The oxidation of the solid portion of PM, or soot, is a complex and non-linear process which can occur either with or without catalysts. In addition, lubrication-derived, incombustible ash accumulates in the DPF and over time accounts for a majority of the trapped mass in the DPF on average. As soot and ash accumulate in the DPF, the pressure drop over the filter increases, which negatively affects the fuel economy. Improved understanding of the fundamental properties of soot and ash leads to more efficient aftertreatment components. The work in this thesis consisted of two related focus areas, including <b>diesel</b> soot <b>oxidation</b> and the effects of ash accumulation on the DPF. An experimental method was developed to study the kinetics of the non-catalytic oxidation of carbon by O 2, while a theoretical model was constructed to describe the relationship between carbon microsctructure and reactivity.

Several automobile and related {{companies such as}} Delphi, Ford, Chrysler, and Toyota have also put extensive research into development of NOx sensors. Many academic and government labs are pushing to develop the sensors as well. The term NOx represents several forms of nitrogen oxides such as NO (nitric oxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and N2O (nitrous oxide aka laughing gas). In a gasoline engine NO {{is the most common}} form of NOx being around 93% while NO2 is around 5% and the rest is N2O. There are other forms of NOx such as N2O4 (the dimer of NO2), which only exists at lower temperatures, and N2O5, for example. However, owing to much higher combustion temperatures due to high cylinder compression and turbo or supercharging, diesel engines produce much higher engine-out NOx emissions than spark-ignition gasoline engines do.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{understanding}} of <b>diesel</b> soot <b>oxidation,</b> an experimental rig was designed and set up, in which the soot oxidation conditions, such as temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and CO 2 partial pressure, could be varied independently of each other. The oxidizing gas flow in the oxidizer was under laminar condition. This test rig comprised a naturally-aspirated single cylinder engine which acted as the soot generator, and a separate premixed oxidation burner system in which soot extracted from the engine was oxidized under controlled conditions. Diesel soot was extracted from the engine exhaust pipe and from the engine pre-combustion chamber, and the soot-laden gas was then conveyed to the burner where it was oxidized. The burner was positioned vertically {{and it had a}} flat flame whose thickness was only a few millimetres. The hot gases from the flame flew upwards through a quartz transparent tube which acted as the soot oxidation duct. The soot-laden gas from the engine was premixed with the feedgas (itself a premixed mixture of methane, air, oxygen, and nitrogen) to the burner. The soot particles passed vertically through the flame front and continued burning in the post-flame gas flowing through the quartz tube oxidation duct. The oxygen concentration and temperature of the post-flame soot oxidation gas were controllable by adjusting the flowrate and composition of the burner feedgas. Diesel soot particles were sampled at different heights along the centreline of the quartz tube above the burner. Profiles of oxygen concentration, temperature, and soot particle velocity in the oxidation zone were thus measured. Morphology and size distributions of the sampled diesel soot particles were analyzed by means of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and a computer software called ImagePro Plus. Subsequently, the specific surface oxidation rates of the soot particles were worked out based on soot particle size distributions. The TEM micrographs obtained in this study showed that the diesel soot agglomerates existed in forms of clusters and chains, each containing between a small number and thousands of individual, mostly spherical tiny particles. Of order 97 % of the individual spherical particles (spherules) had a size range from 10 to 80 nm. Occasionally, individual spherules of about 150 nm in diameter could be observed. The diesel soot particles sampled from the pre-chamber of the engine had different size distributions from those sampled from the exhaust of the engine, indicating that the soot underwent an oxidation process in the combustion chamber. Soot oxidation experiments were performed in the burner post-flame gas under oxygen partial pressures ranging from 0. 010 to 0. 050 atm and temperatures from 1520 to 1820 K. The test results showed that the oxidation rates of the diesel soot extracted from the diesel engine were generally lower than those predicted by the well-known Nagle and Strickland-Constable formula; however, the measured oxidation rates were higher than the predictions made with another well-known formula - the Lee formula. The soot extracted from the engine pre-chamber appeared not to oxidize as fast as the soot extracted from the exhaust of the engine. CO 2 gas injection to the post-flame oxidation gas at constant oxygen partial pressure and oxidation temperature seemed to have accelerated the <b>diesel</b> soot <b>oxidation</b> rate. Based on the experimental results of this study and the results of other researchers, modifications to the Nagle and Strickland-Constable formula and to the Lee formula were accomplished.

This work reports a systematic characterization and catalytic evaluation of MnOx nanoparticle-dispersed CeO 2 nanocubes for two important industrial applications, namely, <b>diesel</b> soot <b>oxidation</b> and continuous-flow benzylamine oxidation. The X-ray diffraction and Raman studies reveal an unusual lattice expansion in CeO 2 after the addition of MnOx. This interesting observation is due to conversion of smaller sized Ce 4 + (0. 097 nm) to larger sized Ce 3 + (0. 114 nm) in cerium oxide led by {{the strong interaction between}} MnOx and CeO 2 at their interface. Another striking observation noticed from transmission electron microscopy, high angle annular darkfield scanning transmission electron microscopy, and electron energy loss spectroscopy studies is that the MnOx species are well-dispersed along the edges of the CeO 2 nanocubes. This remarkable decoration leads to an enhanced reducible nature of the cerium oxide at the MnOx/CeO 2 interface.

40|$|Operation of a Diesel {{engine in}} HCCI {{combustion}} mode is typically restricted to moderate engine loads. For practical applications, an engine switching from HCCI to conventional Diesel combustion mode at higher loads {{appears to be}} the most plausible solution. In this light, modeling applicable to both combustion modes is favourable. The performance of Diesel engines is affected by chemical kinetics of fuel oxidation through correct prediction of auto-ignition, especially at complicated injection scenarios such as those for HCCI. Thus, the modeling exploits the advantage of the detailed chemistry approach which incorporates a generalized partially stirred reactor, (PaSR), model coupled with a surrogate <b>diesel</b> fuel <b>oxidation</b> mechanism as a substitute of real hydrocarbon fuel. The surrogate Diesel fuel is assumed to be a 70 / 30 % mixture of n-heptane and toluene, consisting of 68 species participating in 279 reactions. PaSR assumes that chemical processes proceed in two successive steps: the reaction act follows after the micro-mixing simulated on a sub-grid scale. Consistently evaluated time scales for micro-mixing and limiting reaction rates gives a combustion model in a "well-closed" form incorporated into the KIVA- 3 V code. The results of the model were verified by experimental results obtained from a direct injection Diesel engine operated in conventional and HCCI combustion mode. The engine is a single cylinder version of a passenger car type common rail engine with a displacement of 480 cc. Split injection was used for conventional Diesel operation. For HCCI operation, fuel was injected in multiple steps during the compression stroke creating a homogeneous mixture avoiding spray interaction with the cylinder liner and piston.

A systematic physicochemical characterization was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brumauer-Emmett-teller method (BET) surface area, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman, and H 2 -temperature programmed reduction (TPR) techniques. The soot oxidation efficiency of the catalysts was investigated using a thermogravimetric method. The XRD results suggested the formation of nanocrystalline single phase CeO 2 -Sm 2 O 3 and CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 solid solutions. The Sm- and La-doped CeO 2 materials exhibited smaller crystallite size and higher BET surface area compared with the pure CeO 2. Owing to {{the difference in the}} oxidation states of the dopants (Sm 3 + and La 3 +) and the Ce 4 +, a number of oxygen vacancies were generated in CeO 2 -Sm 2 O 3 and CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 samples. The H 2 -TPR studies evidenced the improved reducible nature of the CeO 2 -Sm 2 O 3 and CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 samples compared with the CeO 2. It was found that the addition of Sm and La to the CeO 2 outstandingly enhanced its catalytic efficiency for the <b>oxidation</b> of <b>diesel</b> soot. The observed 50 % soot conversion temperatures for the CeO 2 -Sm 2 O 3, CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 and CeO 2 were ∼ 790, 843 and 864 K (loose contact), respectively, and similar activity order was also found under the tight contact condition. The high soot oxidation efficacy of the CeO 2 -Sm 2 O 3 sample was attributed to numerous catalytically favourable properties, like smaller crystallite size, larger surface area, abundant oxygen vacancies, and superior reducible nature...|$|R
40|$|Modelling {{internal}} combustion engines (I. C. E.) {{can be made}} following different Approaches, {{depending on the type}} of problem to be simulated. A diesel combustion model has been developed and implemented in a full cycle simulation of a combustion model accounts for transient fuel spray evolution, fuel-air mixing, ignition, combustion and soot pollutant formation. The models of turbulent combustion of diffusion flame, apply to diffusion flames, which one meets in industry, typically in the diesel engines Particulate emission represents one of the most deleterious pollutants generated during <b>diesel</b> combustion engines <b>oxidation</b> in {{internal combustion}} engines. A phenomenological numerical Stringent standards on particulate emission along with specific emphasis on size of emitted particulates have resulted in increased interest in fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of soot particulate formation and oxidation in internal combustion model which can predict the particle size distribution of the soot emitted will be very useful in explaining the above observed results and will also be of use to develop better particulate control techniques. A diesel engine chosen for simulation is a version of the Caterpillar 3406. We are interested in employing a standard finite-volume CFD (computational fluid dynamics) code, KIVA 3 V-RELEASE 2.
