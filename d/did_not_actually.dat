5|$|According to Njal's Saga, Óspak was on {{the wing}} {{opposite}} King Sigtrygg Silkbeard. Óspak went through the entire battle on this wing, and was sorely wounded and lost both his sons before Sigtrygg fled. However, that Óspak engaged Sigtrygg contradicts the historical opinion that Sigtrygg <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> {{take part in the}} battle but was instead holding the garrison in reserve in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s, Creangă {{had become}} afflicted with epilepsy, {{suffering}} accelerated and debilitating episodes. He was also severely overweight, weighing some 120 kilograms (over 250pounds), with {{a height of}} 1.85 meters (6feet), and being teasingly nicknamed Burduhănosul ("Tubby") by his friends (although, according to testimonies by his son and daughter-in-law, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> look his size).|$|E

5|$|Despite American {{hunger for}} land, the {{leadership}} in the Minnesota Territory <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> want to remove the Sioux from the territory. Federal subsidies to the tribes were heavily siphoned by the U.S. settlements and removal of the tribes from the territory would have meant loss of this income.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Oscar Arias, President of Costa Rica, {{contacted}} Louisville mayor Jerry Abramson {{to inquire}} about buying the bridge to dismantle it and reassemble in Costa Rica, as he believed it would be cheaper to import the bridge than build a new one. At the time the city <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> own the bridge, and the plan never went through.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other matters}} were also raised, {{relating}} to particular {{parts of the}} evidence (specifically, relating to the witness testimony of Yahya Goba, one of the Buffalo Six), but these matters had little bearing on the final outcome of the case, and were dealt with only briefly by the court. The central argument raised was that, with regard to all the circumstances, Thomas <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> have a practical choice whether to speak or not.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 2007, SvalSat was {{expanded}} with 12 antennas. Five {{are used for}} Galileo, while the remaining are used for a large array of customers. In 2007 and 2008, both Terra and Landsat 7 were hacked twice. The hackers were able to achieve all steps {{which would have been}} necessary to take control over the satellites, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> take control. The operation commanded the satellites via SvalSat, which it was able to hack via the Internet connection.|$|E
5|$|Thatched or tiled roofs were {{supported}} by wooden pillars, since the addition of brick, rammed earth, or mud walls of these halls <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> support the roof. Stone and plaster were also used for domestic architecture. Tiled eaves projecting outward were built to distance falling rainwater from the walls; they {{were supported}} by dougong brackets that were sometimes elaborately decorated. Molded designs usually decorated the ends of roof tiles, as seen in artistic models of buildings and in surviving tile pieces.|$|E
5|$|The Screaming Skulls opening {{disclaimer}} that a free burial {{would be}} provided to anybody who died of fright while watching the film {{was inspired by a}} gimmick that had been used by William Castle in his film Macabre (1958), in which he offered every viewer who bought a ticket life insurance in case they died watching the film. Unlike Castle, Nicol <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> contact an insurance company.|$|E

5|$|The court {{eventually}} {{declared that}} they could not issue a writ, because the Habeas Corpus Act 1862 prevented them from issuing a writ to any colony possessing a court which could also issue a writ. Since Ireland possessed such a court, the English Divisional Court could not act. Hastings attempted to argue that the writ could be issued against the Home Secretary but this also failed, since the Home Secretary <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> possess O'Brien.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plans for}} the Centre were {{that it would have}} a concert hall, however the final design of phase 1 did not include one. Space had been left, though, for a concert hall to be built in the future when phase 1 of the Centre was opened in 2004, and construction on phase 2 was then due to begin early in 2005. However, construction of phase 2 <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> begin until April 2007. Phase 2 was designed to fit into the Centre's curved slate frontage, with an upper part constructed from timber.|$|E
5|$|Cannan {{commanded}} the 2/15th Infantry from 1 October 1918 to 30 June 1920, although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> take up command until 14 December 1919. On 1 July 1920, {{he became a}} substantive colonel and honorary brigadier general on assuming command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade. He then {{commanded the}} 11th Mixed Brigade from 1 May 1921 to 30 April 1925, when he {{was transferred to the}} unattached list. Cannan was also aide de camp to the Governor General from 1 April 1920 to 21 March 1923 and honorary colonel of the 47th Infantry Battalion from 19 June 1930.|$|E

5|$|Carleton ordered {{most of the}} British army to sail upriver toward Sorel on June 9, {{but they}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> leave until he joined them on June 13. A {{detachment}} of 1200 men under Fraser marched up the northern shore toward Berthier and Montreal. The British fleet arrived at Sorel late on the 14th; the Americans had left there just that morning. Elements of the British army entered Montreal on June 17, and also arrived at Fort Saint-Jean {{in time to see}} the last Americans (the very last one reported to be Benedict Arnold) push away from its burning remnants.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of the}} Cold War, NATO's watch {{against the}} Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> lead to direct {{military}} action. On 1July 1968, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons opened for signature: NATO argued that its nuclear sharing arrangements did not breach the treaty as US forces controlled the weapons until {{a decision was made}} to go to war, at which point the treaty would no longer be controlling. Few states knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements at that time, and they were not challenged. In May 1978, NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance, to maintain security and pursue détente. This was supposed to mean matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the Warsaw Pact's offensive capabilities without spurring a further arms race.|$|E
5|$|He {{retained}} command until September 1938, when he {{was appointed}} to the Admiralty as Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff, although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> take up this post until December 1939. He accepted this shore job with reluctance since he loathed administration, but the Board of Admiralty's high regard of him was evident. For six months during an illness of Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse, the then First Sea Lord, he deputised for Backhouse on the Committee of Imperial Defence and on the Admiralty Board. In 1939 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), becoming known as Sir Andrew Cunningham.|$|E

5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v. Churchill, {{in which it}} had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for her comments about a supervisor to a colleague, despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of those comments. The Court found that the hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing her. In that case, the Court had said explicitly that disciplining employees for things they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> do did not {{rise to the level}} of a constitutional violation.|$|E
5|$|Numerous notable and {{prominent}} {{people of the}} era, who held tickets for the westbound passage or were guests of those who held tickets, did not sail. Others were waiting in New York to board for the passage back to Plymouth, England, on the second leg of Titanics maiden voyage. Many unused tickets that survived, whether they were for the westbound passage or the return eastbound passage, have become quite valuable as Titanic-related artifacts. Among those who held tickets for a passage, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> sail, include: Theodore Dreiser, Henry Clay Frick, Milton S. Hershey, Guglielmo Marconi, John Pierpont Morgan, Edgar Selwyn, and Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt (who died in {{the sinking of the}} RMS Lusitania).|$|E
5|$|Some {{participants}} {{tried to}} track Russian down {{to have their}} questions answered. One contestant, Louise Miles, discovered that Russian's production company, NRP, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>actually</b> exist and that {{the woman who had}} been answering their phone calls was really Russian's mother, Margaret. Another participant, Daniel Pope, managed to track Russian down to an address in Richmond upon Thames and convinced him to be interviewed by Christmas TV and apologise on camera. As Russian had not actually taken money from his victims, he had not committed a crime, and a civil case was not pursued {{due to a lack of}} funds.|$|E
