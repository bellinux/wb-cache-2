30|$|The {{access to}} credit variable, an <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> constraint, is {{positive}} and significantly different from zero, suggesting that liquidity-constrained farmers {{are less likely to}} participate. This confirms the significance of {{access to credit}} in participation decision process. Access to credit for various inputs enables farmers to easily participate in dairy hub unlike in cases where it is a constraint. Therefore, increased access to institutional support services such as extension, credit, and input supply should be a major part of efforts aimed at promoting dairy hub participation, as pointed out by Khonje et al. (2015 a, b). Land holding has a significant positive effect on the likelihood of dairy hub participation. Larger farms are at a certain advantage, which may be due to fixed transaction costs in dairy hub channel such as transportation costs and information search costs (Rao and Qaim 2011).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the importance of}} financial constraints for firm investment expenditures {{by looking at the}} relationship between investment expenditures and proceeds from voluntary asset sales in financially healthy US manufacturing companies. Specifically, we examine whether asset sales have a greater influence on investment expenditures for firms that are likely to be financially constrained. Asset sales may provide a cleaner <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> than cash flow since it appears not to be positively correlated with future investment opportunities. The cross-sectional differences in firm investment expenditures are examined using an endogenous switching regression model with unknown sample separation, which does not require an a priori classification of firms or knowledge of their financial constraints. We find that after controlling for investment opportunities and cash generated from operations, cash obtained from asset sales is a significant determinant of corporate investment. Moreover, the sensitivity of investment to proceeds from asset sales is significantly stronger for firms that are likely to be associated with characteristics associated with financial constraints. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I explain two "puzzles" {{which have}} been {{observed}} in firm level data. (1) Firms which display a high sensitivity of investment to cash flow (commonly believed to be an <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> constraints) usually have large unutilized lines of credit which, presumably, {{could be used to}} overcome the shortage of funds. (2) Firms which are perceived to be extremely liquidity constrained actually show very little sensitivity of investment to cash flow. I use a dynamic model of firm investment with liquidity constraints and non convex costs of adjustment of capital which can explain these facts. The fixed cost of adjustment in the presence of liquidity constraints implies that firms need to have a certain threshold level of financial resources before they can afford to invest and incur these costs. Below this level, investment will not be sensitive to increases in cash flow. Once they cross this threshold, firms' investment will be positively correlated with their financial resources until they reach their desired level of capital stock. However, even if investment is sensitive to cash flow, firms always borrow below their credit limit to guard against future bankruptcy or binding liquidity constraints. I show therefore, that a firm which displays investment cash-flow sensitivity is certainly liquidity constrained. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{research}} {{issues related}} to asymmetric information on capital markets. It is realistic to assume that all market participants do not have available all the information. The Serbian capital market is characterized by high informational asymmetry between investors. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} consider asymmetric information on the capital market, and estimate its impact on the expected asset returns. Thus, in this paper we described {{issues related to}} asymmetric information on the Serbian capital market. Public reporting in Serbia doesn’t have any serious rules, and insider information is widely used. It was happened that people respond on rumours with large investments. The paper presents the probability of informed trading (PIT measure), which would be a useful <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> for emerging and frontier markets. Therefore, the main goal {{of this paper is to}} examine impact of asymmetric information on efficiency of capital markets. More precisely, it considers market equilibrium with investors who have asymmetrical information. For this reason, the paper presents empirical model in order to examine the impact of asymmetric information on the assets pricing. Generally, capital markets are not perfect. In particular, emerging and frontier markets are not perfect, specifically (for example, the Serbian capital market). However, there is information asymmetry through which borrowers (securities issuers) know more about the risks than the lenders to (securities purchasers). Thus, market participants may be reluctant to trade with these assets, whose characteristics and behaviour under varying economic conditions are not well known.

The main contribution of the paper is twofold.

Second, I move one step further with respect to previous studies on consumption behaviour by taking explicitly expected liquidity constraints into account. I eventually found the precautionary motive for savings to be stronger for those households who face binding constraints, or expect constraints to be binding in the future. Indeed, a complementarity relation exists between precautionary savings and liquidity constraints...|$|R
