We {{define a}} {{category}} containing <b>the</b> discrete quantum <b>groups</b> (<b>and</b> hence <b>the</b> discrete <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> duals of compact <b>groups)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> compact quantum <b>groups</b> (<b>and</b> hence <b>the</b> compact <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> duals of discrete groups). The dual {{of an object}} can be defined within <b>the</b> same category <b>and</b> we have a biduality theorem. This theory extends the duality between compact quantum <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> discrete quantum <b>groups</b> (<b>and</b> hence <b>the</b> one between compact abelian <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> discrete abelian <b>groups).</b> <b>The</b> objects in our category are multiplier Hopf algebras, with invertible antipode, ad-mitting invariant functionals (integrals), satisfying some extra condition (to {{take care of the}} non-abelianness of the underlying algebras). If we start with a multiplier Hopf ∗-algebra with positive invariant functionals, then also the dual is a multiplier Hopf ∗-algebra with positive invariant functionals. This makes it possible to formulate this duality also within the framework of C∗-algebras. 1. Introduction. Let (A,...|$|R

Even at this early time, both the STAC <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959, Hawker approached Lockheed, and after the creation of British Aircraft Corporation in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with Boeing, General Dynamics, Douglas Aircraft and Sud Aviation.|$|E
