5|$|Although Cooper {{voted in}} favor of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, he opposed {{escalating}} U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia. He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale. On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations. Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling <b>for</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to brief the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Frank {{meets with}} Congressman Donald Blythe (Reed Birney), a {{committed}} progressive liberal {{who has long}} pushed for education reform, with whom the Walker administration wants {{to work on a}} bill. Frank dismisses his proposal as too ambitious and asks him to rewrite it. Frank secretly passes a copy of Blythe’s proposal to Zoe. He then meets with Senator Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) and suggests that she ought to consider seeking the nomination <b>for</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State. He also privately confronts Congressman Russo about his arrest and checkered history of substance abuse and soliciting prostitutes, and demands Russo’s loyalty in exchange for making the incident disappear.|$|E
5|$|President James Monroe's {{first choice}} <b>for</b> <b>Secretary</b> of War was Henry Clay, who {{declined}} the office. When Johnson also declined to serve, the post ultimately went to John C. Calhoun. The {{result was that}} Johnson became chair of the Committee on Expenditures where he wielded considerable influence over defense policy in the Department of War during the Fifteenth Congress. In 1817, Congress investigated General Andrew Jackson's execution of two British subjects during the First Seminole War. Johnson chaired the inquiry committee. The majority of the committee favored a negative report and a censure for Jackson. Johnson, a Jackson supporter, drafted a counter report that was more favorable to Jackson and opposed the censure. The ensuing debate pitted Johnson against fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay. Johnson's report prevailed, and Jackson was spared censure. This disagreement between Johnson and Clay, however, {{marked the beginning of}} a political separation between the two that lasted for the duration of their careers.|$|E
5|$|Several {{political}} changes preceded {{the passage of}} the settlement act. First, Senator Edmund Muskie (D-ME)who previously seemed supportive of a settlement, but was gaining national prominence on the issue of fiscal responsibility prior to the 1980 Democratic primarygave up his seat as Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to accept President Carter's nomination <b>for</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State. Second, Governor Brennan's choice to replace Muskie (and thus inherit his predecessor's committee assignments) was George Mitchell (D-ME)who had supported the land claim as U.S. Attorney and possessed legal gravitas due to his tenure as a District Judge. Another factor affecting the final push for the settlement was the fear that, if Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election, he would veto any settlement favorable toward the tribes.|$|E

5|$|Washington, {{alarmed by}} what {{appeared}} to be an armed insurrection in Western Pennsylvania, asked his cabinet for written opinions {{about how to deal with}} the crisis. The cabinet recommended the use of force, except <b>for</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State Randolph who urged reconciliation.

When the final report of the commissioners recommended the use of the military to enforce the laws, the president invoked the Militia Law of 1792 to summon the militias of Pennsylvania, Virginia and several other states. The governors sent the troops and Washington took command as Commander-in-Chief, marching into the rebellious districts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some historians}} have belittled Grant's cabinet as being mediocre, {{according}} to biographers Jean Edward Smith and Ron Chernow, it had distinguished members, including former congressmen, senators, governors, and judges. Without senatorial consultation, Grant's unconventional cabinet choices sparked both criticism and approval. In {{his effort to}} create national harmony, he purposely avoided choosing Republican Party leaders, selecting several non-politicians. Grant chose two close friends for important posts: Elihu B. Washburne <b>for</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State and John A. Rawlins as Secretary of War; Washburne was soon appointed minister to France and replaced by conservative New York statesman Hamilton Fish. Rawlins died in office after serving only a few months, replaced by William W. Belknap of Iowa. For Treasury, he appointed wealthy New York merchant Alexander T. Stewart, who was found ineligible and replaced by Representative George S. Boutwell, a Massachusetts Radical Republican. Grant appointed Philadelphia businessman Adolph E. Borie Secretary of Navy, who soon resigned, {{and was replaced by}} a relative unknown, George M. Robeson. Grant's nomination of James Longstreet, a former Confederate general, to the position of Surveyor of customs of the port of New Orleans, was met with general amazement, and was largely seen as a genuine effort to unite the North and South. Other cabinet appointments—Jacob D. Cox (Interior), John Creswell (Postmaster General), and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar (Attorney General)—were well received.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November, the Armistice with Germany {{that ended}} World War I went into effect. The {{terms of the}} Armistice {{required}} Germany to intern {{the bulk of the}} High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow, {{under the supervision of the}} Grand Fleet. Arkansas and the other American warships participated in the internment; a combined fleet of 370 British, American, and French warships met the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea on 21 November, and escorted it into Scapa Flow. On 1 December, Battleship Division 9 was detached from the Grand Fleet, after which Arkansas departed the Firth of Forth for the Isle of Portland. She then went to sea to meet the ocean liner , which was carrying President Wilson to Europe. Arkansas and the other American naval forces in Europe escorted the ship into Brest, France, on 13 December.
