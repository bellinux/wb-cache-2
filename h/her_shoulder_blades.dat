25|$|Sheena {{was born}} with an esophageal atresia in which the {{esophagus}} narrows as it approaches the stomach. Treatment of this involved several operations, {{at least one of}} which required her right shoulder blade to be cut open. These surgeries left Sheena with large scars on <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades,</b> said {{to give the impression that}} an angel's wings had been removed.|$|E
25|$|On April 30 {{during a}} quarterfinal match with Magdalena Maleeva in Hamburg in which Seles was leading, Günter Parche, an obsessed fan of Steffi Graf, {{ran from the}} middle of the crowd to the edge of the court during a break between games and stabbed Seles with a boning knife between <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades,</b> to a depth of 1.5cm (0.59inches). She was quickly rushed to a hospital. Although her {{physical}} injuries took only a few weeks to heal, she did not return to competitive tennis for more than two years. Initially, there was speculation that the attack might have been politically motivated because Seles was from Yugoslavia. She was known to have received death threats in relation to the ongoing conflict in her native Yugoslavia. However, German authorities were quick to rule this out, describing her attacker as confused and possibly mentally disturbed.|$|E

5000|$|Cynthia Frances Maas, 35, {{last seen}} September 10, 2010. Her {{body was found}} in a Prince George park the {{following}} month.

5000|$|According to an {{interview}} with the CSI division in Salt Lake City, the sum total of Lori's remains were, two teeth, and a piece of bone the size of a quarter, which is believed to have come from <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade.</b> Searchers actually found the carpet that Mark admitted to rolling her body into, before placing it in the dumpster.|$|R
5|$|During {{the third}} {{hour after the}} shooting, an autopsy was {{performed}} due to overwhelming media interest. It revealed that the bullet had entered Selena's upper right back, near <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade,</b> passed through <b>her</b> chest cavity, severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest. Doctors {{said that if the}} bullet had been only one millimeter higher or lower, the wound would have been less severe.|$|R
2500|$|Art is an {{approximately}} 9-foot tall (274.32cm) {{statue of}} a young female figure wearing a floor-length tunic underneath an intricately tied outer garment, which is pinned at her proper left shoulder with a fibula. The outer garment is belted at the sculpture's upper and lower waist and is approximately two inches shorter than the tunic. The skirts of both the tunic and outer garment fall towards {{the floor in a}} multitude of folds. It is crossed diagonally over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades</b> and loosely gathered on her proper right chest, exposing her neck and breastbone. The statue's hair is parted in the middle and pulled back from her face into a twisted bun, and a crown of laurel leaves is nestled atop her head. Her gaze is directed forwards and her features are idealized, like the other female figures of the sculpture group with the exception of Justice. In her proper left hand, she carries a round palette held down at her side, and in her proper right hand, a paintbrush held in front of her at waist height. She stands with her weight on both feet, with her proper right foot extended slightly forward of her proper left. There are several dots of an unknown black substance on the marble base underneath her feet, in front of her proper left foot. There is no discernible foundry mark or signature, but the statue is identified by the black label attached to the cement pedestal underneath her feet, which reads [...] "ART" [...] in gold lettering.|$|E
60|$|Between incumbencies of Finn maids {{from the}} North Woods, Germans from the prairies, {{occasional}} Swedes and Norwegians and Icelanders, Carol did her own work--and endured Aunt Bessie's skittering in {{to tell her}} how to dampen a broom for fluffy dust, how to sugar doughnuts, how to stuff a goose. Carol was deft, and won shy praise from Kennicott, but as <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades</b> began to sting, she wondered how many millions of women had lied to themselves during the death-rimmed years through which they had pretended to enjoy the puerile methods persisting in housework.|$|E
60|$|I sat on in {{the garden}} till the last thin ray of {{sunlight}} was gone. Then, in dread that my enemy might be looking down from {{the windows of the}} house, I slipped and shuffled from bush to bush in the dusk, and so at last made my way into the house, and climbed the dark polished staircase. As, stealthily, I passed a bedroom door ajar, my look pierced through the crevice. It was a long, stretching, shallow room, {{and at the end of}} it, in the crystal quiet, stood Fanny, her arms laid on the chimney-piece, <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades</b> sticking out of her muslin gown, her face hidden in her hands.|$|E

5000|$|Dennis won her {{heat of the}} 200-metre breaststroke, {{setting an}} Olympic record. She {{narrowly}} escaped disqualification when a protest was lodged against her [...] "inappropriate" [...] costume {{on the grounds that}} it exposed too much of <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade.</b> Dennis changed <b>her</b> swimming style after the heats on the advice of American swimmer Buster Crabbe, who recommended she swim three strokes underwater after her starting dive before surfacing. Using her new technique, she touched in first place at every turn to claim the gold medal, 0.1 of a second faster than Japan's Hideko Maehata, improving on her previous Olympic record.|$|R

Cardiologist Louis Elkins continued the treatment and performed surgery based on the emergency room physician's decision. After 50 minutes of surgery, she was pronounced dead from blood loss and cardiac arrest at 1:05 p.m. (CST). An autopsy was performed due to overwhelming media interest. It revealed that the bullet had entered Selena's upper right back, near <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade,</b> passed through <b>her</b> chest cavity, severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest.

60|$|For {{the first}} time since she had been ten--and in a state of naughtiness {{immediately}} following a pronounced state of grace induced by the pulpit oratory of the new rector of St. Chrysostom's--she permitted herself the luxury of not stopping to brush her teeth before she went to bed. Her sleep was drugged--it was not sleep, but an aching exhaustion of the body which did not prevent her mind from revisualizing the road, going stupidly over the muddy stretches and sharp corners, then becoming conscious of that bed, the lump under <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades,</b> the slope to westward, and the creak that rose every time she tossed. For at least fifteen minutes she lay awake for hours.|$|E
6000|$|Let us be plain. The Angel of {{this story}} is the Angel of Art, not the Angel that one must be irreverent to touch--neither the Angel of {{religious}} feeling nor the Angel of popular belief. The last we all know. She is alone among the angelic hosts in being distinctly feminine: she wears a robe of immaculate, unmitigated white with sleeves, is fair, with long golden tresses, and has eyes of the blue of Heaven. Just a pure woman she is, pure maiden or pure matron, in her robe de nuit, and with wings attached to <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades.</b> Her callings are domestic and sympathetic, she watches over a cradle or assists a sister soul heavenward. Often she bears a palm leaf, but one {{would not be surprised}} if one met her carrying a warming-pan softly to some poor chilly sinner. She it was who came down in a bevy to Marguerite in prison, in the amended last scene in Faust at the Lyceum, and the interesting and improving little children that are to die young, have visions of such angels in the novels of Mrs Henry Wood. This white womanliness with her indescribable charm of lavender-like holiness, her aroma of clean, methodical lives, is, it would seem after all, a purely Teutonic invention. Latin thought knows her not; the old masters have none of her. She is of a piece with that gentle innocent ladylike school of art whereof the greatest triumph is [...] "a lump in one's throat," [...] and where wit and passion, scorn and pomp, have no place. The white angel was made in Germany, in the land of blonde women and the domestic sentiments. She comes to us cool and worshipful, pure and tranquil, as silently soothing as the breadth and calmness of the starlit sky, which also is so unspeakably dear to the Teutonic soul.... We do her reverence. And to the angels of the Hebrews, those spirits of power and mystery, to Raphael, Zadkiel, and Michael, of whom only Watts has caught the shadow, of whom only Blake has seen the splendour, to them too, do we do reverence.|$|E

Cardiologist Louis Elkins continued the treatment and performed surgery based on the emergency room physician's decision. Doctors were able to establish an [...] "erratic heartbeat" [...] long enough to transfer her to the trauma room. After 50 minutes of surgery, she was pronounced dead from blood loss and cardiac arrest at 1:05p.m. (CST). An autopsy was performed on the same day due to overwhelming media interest. It revealed that the bullet had entered Selena's upper right back, near <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade,</b> passed through <b>her</b> chest cavity, severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest. Doctors said that if the bullet had been only one millimeter higher or lower, the wound would have been less severe.|$|R
50|$|About 8:00 a.m. on July 3, Wade was {{kneading}} dough {{for bread}} when a Minié ball traveled {{through the kitchen}} door and the parlor door of her sister's house and hit her.

While it is uncertain which side fired the fatal shot, some authors have attributed it to an unknown Confederate sharpshooter.|$|R
5000|$|Given her {{physical}} assets, she, {{along with her}} designer friend Givenchy, created a dress to fit {{her role in the}} film of a waif. A well chosen black silk dress with appropriate accessories hit the bull's eye to bring her effervescent personality to the fore; the dark oversized sunglasses completed the ensemble of the little black dress (LBD) which was called [...] "the definitive LBD". The dress, which outlined <b>her</b> lean <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades,</b> thus became the Hepburn style.|$|R

Owlish Brewster (Bud Cort), living hidden and alone under the Houston Astrodome, dreams of creating wings that will help him fly like a bird. His only assistance comes from Louise (Sally Kellerman), a beautiful woman who wants to help. Wearing only a trench coat, Louise has unexplained scars on <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades,</b> suggestive of a fallen angel. She warns him against having sexual intercourse, as this could kill his instinct to fly.|$|E

The man's left hand holds the lady's right hand, palm to palm in an upper-hand clasp, with fingers and thumbs closed around partner's hand. The man's right hand must rest on the lady's back, loosely cupped with fingers and thumb together (not spread apart). The man's hand connects to her back on <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade.</b> His wrist should make contact with her underarm at the junction of her arm and body.

5000|$|In {{a storage}} {{room at the}} back of the gallery, the demon stands staring into space, then turns when Angel comes in behind her. She orders him to leave but at that moment, wind and {{lightning}} and thunder spring from nowhere. A swirling portal forms, the shrieking coming from it seeming to draw rapidly closer. A naked humanoid girl drops out of the portal and hits the floor hard. As Angel pulls over a tarp to cover her, he gets a brief but clear glimpse of the girl's smooth forehead and of the raised ridges running along her upper spine. At that moment, Tae and his all-male team break into the room armed with kama weapons. The female demon and Angel battle furiously, but Tae abducts the newly arrived girl and drives away with her. Looking helplessly after the speeding vehicle, Angel asks the female demon what will happen to the girl and learns that she will be [...] "unmade." [...] The male demons take the frightened girl to their base where, without further ado, they use a special clamping tool to cut out the raised ridges extending down from the girl's nape to between <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades.</b> Gone breathless with fear, the girl screams in agony at the first cut.|$|E
