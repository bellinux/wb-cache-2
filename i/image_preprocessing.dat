40|$|Climate {{change is}} a factor that largely {{contributes}} to the increase of forest areas affected by natural damages. Therefore, the development of methodologies for forest monitoring and rapid assessment of affected areas is required. Space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery with high resolution is now available for large-scale forest mapping and forest monitoring applications. However, a correct interpretation of SAR images requires an adequate preprocessing of the data consisting of orthorectification and radiometric calibration. The resolution {{and quality of the}} digital elevation model (DEM) used as reference is crucial for this purpose. Therefore, the primary aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the influence of the DEM quality used in the preprocessing of the SAR data on the mapping accuracy of forest types. In order to examine TerraSAR-X images to map forest dominated by deciduous and coniferous trees, High Resolution SpotLight images were acquired for two study sites in southern Germany. The SAR <b>images</b> were <b>preprocessed</b> with a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM (resolution approximately 90  m), an airborne laser scanning (ALS) digital terrain model (DTM) (5  m resolution), and an ALS digital surface model (DSM) (5  m resolution). The orthorectification of the SAR images using high resolution ALS DEMs was found to be important for the reduction of errors in pixel location and to increase the classification accuracy of forest types. SAR <b>images</b> <b>preprocessed</b> with ALS DTMs resulted in the highest classification accuracies, with kappa coefficients of 0. 49 and 0. 41, respectively. SAR <b>images</b> <b>preprocessed</b> with ALS DTMs resulted in greater accuracy than those preprocessed with ALS DSMs in most cases. The classification accuracy of forest types using SAR <b>images</b> <b>preprocessed</b> with the SRTM DEM was fair, with kappa coefficients of 0. 23 and 0. 32, respectively. Analysis of the radar backscatter indicated that sample plots dominated by coniferous trees tended to have lower scattering coefficients than plots dominated by deciduous trees. Leaf-off images were only slightly better suited for the classification than leaf-on images. The combination of leaf-off and leaf-on improved the classification accuracy considerably since the backscatter changed between seasons, especially in deciduous-dominated forest...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Image {{segmentation}} {{is crucial}} to object-oriented remote sensing imagery analysis. In this paper, a newly modified texture segmentation algorithm is proposed using spectral, shape and intensity features. This algorithm is a robust technique {{that can be applied}} directly to the color images. The <b>image</b> is <b>preprocessed</b> using Adaptive Switching Median Filter, which removes the impulse noises and keeping the fine details of the image intact in the most efficient manner. Also, the <b>preprocessed</b> <b>image</b> is smoothened using morphological operators, which reduces the false detection of abnormal cells. Then, the <b>preprocessed</b> <b>image</b> is transformed into HSV (Hue, Saturation and value) color space representation in order to analyze and establish a color contrast gradient. The multiscale morphological gradient in the intensity channel of the <b>preprocessed</b> <b>image</b> is obtained and multiplied with the color contrast gradient. The shape feature is extracted from the <b>preprocessed</b> <b>image</b> based on the descriptors such as compactness, convexness, rectangularity and eccentricity, moment invariants. Based on these spectral, shape and intensity features, markers are extracted for this image and given as input to the watershed algorithm which uses a Hill-Climbing approach to identify and label the neighborhood pixels. This algorithm may reduce the computational complexity by avoiding the process of computing lower-complete image.
