5|$|Tall {{and slender}} forms of Mycena polygramma {{somewhat}} resemble M.pullata or M.praelonga. The former species is distinguished by <b>its</b> <b>color,</b> {{and the latter}} by its relationship to M.alcalina and its habitat on sphagnum.|$|E
5|$|A raw 3D {{model of}} Jacob's wolf {{was the basis}} for {{creating}} the others. A muscle system, which gave the appearance of muscles firing and flexing, contributed to this model. From there, the initial fur layout went to painters who were responsible for <b>its</b> <b>color</b> and groom. They also added characteristics, such as wet hair clumping together, and applied it to the fur. They refined this look before passing it off to the lighting and technical directors.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} pet species, {{a variety of}} colors, coat types, and other {{features}} that do {{not appear in the}} wild have either been developed, or have appeared spontaneously. Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by <b>its</b> <b>color,</b> coat, marking, and non-standard body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a drop of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses <b>its</b> <b>color</b> and becomes a pale blue.|$|E
5|$|Its {{brightest}} star, Alpha Andromedae, is {{a binary}} star that {{has also been}} counted {{as a part of}} Pegasus, while Gamma Andromedae is a colorful binary and a popular target for amateur astronomers. Only marginally dimmer than Alpha, Beta Andromedae is a red giant, <b>its</b> <b>color</b> visible to the naked eye. The constellation's most obvious deep-sky object is the naked-eye Andromeda Galaxy (M31, also called the Great Galaxy of Andromeda), the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and one of the brightest Messier objects. Several fainter galaxies, including M31's companions M110 and M32, as well as the more distant NGC 891, lie within Andromeda. The Blue Snowball Nebula, a planetary nebula, is visible in a telescope as a blue circular object.|$|E
5|$|The asci are 400–500 by 12–14µm, cylindrical, and operculate. The ascospores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical with rounded ends, uniseriate, hyaline, {{and measure}} 26–40 by 10–12µm. They contain two large oil drops at either end; the oil drops are useful taxonomic characters {{that may be}} used to help distinguish S.dudleyi from some other Sarcoscypha species. The spores are covered with a sheath of mucilage, which typically causes the eight spores of the ascus to be ejected together. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphal end cells in the hymenium) are slender, slightly enlarged above, and contain numerous red granules. The granules contain carotenoid pigments such as plectaniaxanthine or beta carotene, and give the fruit body <b>its</b> <b>color.</b>|$|E

25|$|Prasiolite, {{an olive}} colored material, is {{produced}} by heat treatment; natural prasiolite has also been observed in Lower Silesia in Poland. Although citrine occurs naturally, the majority {{is the result of}} heat-treated amethyst. Carnelian is widely heat-treated to deepen <b>its</b> <b>color.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{solution}} of phenol red {{is used as}} a pH indicator, often in cell culture. <b>Its</b> <b>color</b> exhibits a gradual transition from yellow (λmax = 443nm) to red (λmax = 570nm) over the pH range 6.8 to 8.2. Above pH 8.2, phenol red turns a bright pink (fuchsia) color.|$|E

25|$|The walnut orb-weaver spider is {{very wide}} and flattened, with a {{leathery}} skin. <b>Its</b> <b>color</b> ranges from red brown and grey brown to black with a dark, yellowish to yellow-greenish leaf-like fleckled marking on its opisthosoma, where small dents are visible. These are the onsets of muscles that flatten the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|When a CFL is dimmed, <b>its</b> <b>color</b> {{temperature}} (warmth) stays the same. This is {{counter to}} most other light sources (such {{as the sun}} or incandescents) where color gets redder as the light source gets dimmer. The Kruithof curve from 1934 described an empirical relationship between intensity and color temperature of visually pleasing light sources.|$|E
25|$|Amber is fossilized tree resin, {{which has}} been {{appreciated}} for <b>its</b> <b>color</b> and natural beauty since Neolithic times.

25|$|Jaggery: a {{solidified}} molasses, {{known as}} gur or gud or gul in India, is traditionally produced by evaporating juice {{to make a}} thick sludge, and then cooling and molding it in buckets. Modern production partially freeze dries the juice to reduce caramelization and lighten <b>its</b> <b>color.</b> It is used as sweetener in cooking traditional entrees, sweets and desserts.|$|E
25|$|Low {{levels of}} {{catalase}} {{may play a}} role in the graying process of human hair. Hydrogen peroxide is naturally produced by the body and broken down by catalase. If catalase levels decline, hydrogen peroxide cannot be broken down so well. The hydrogen peroxide interferes with the production of melanin, the pigment that gives hair <b>its</b> <b>color.</b>|$|E
25|$|A coffee {{percolator}} {{is a type}} of pot used to brew coffee. In {{the case}} of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee <b>its</b> <b>color,</b> taste, and aroma. In 1806, Benjamin Thompson Rumford invented the percolating coffee pot with a metal sieve to strain away the grounds.|$|E

25|$|While rivals CBS and the DuMont Television Network {{also had}} plans to begin {{offering}} color television broadcasts, RCA convinced the FCC to approve <b>its</b> <b>color</b> system in December 1953.

25|$|Cut {{also affects}} {{the color of}} a diamond. This is {{especially}} important when considering fancy colored diamonds, where the slightest shift in color could vastly affect the price of the diamond. Most fancy colored diamonds are not cut in to round brilliants, because whereas the round brilliant is prized for its ability to reflect white light, the most important characteristic in a fancy colored diamond is <b>its</b> <b>color,</b> not its ability to reflect white light.|$|E
