40|$|Purpose of the Study: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if there is a significant difference between a mother 2 ̆ 7 s awareness of the self-concept of a learning <b>disabled</b> <b>child</b> and her awareness of the self-concept of a normal sibling. The study surveyed twenty-three mothers, their learning <b>disabled,</b> and normal <b>children.</b> Findings: The Piers-Harris Children 2 ̆ 7 s Self-Concept Scale, 1969 edition, was used to obtain the data. The results of this study showed that there is a significant difference between a mother 2 ̆ 7 s awareness of the self- concept of a learning <b>disabled</b> <b>child</b> and her awareness of the self-concept of a normal sibling. Conclusion: This study showed that mothers are more aware of their normal child 2 ̆ 7 s self-concept than they are aware of their learning <b>disabled</b> <b>child</b> 2 ̆ 7 s self-concept. Implications: On the basis of the foregoing findings and conclusions, the following implications were drawn: (1) The results of this study indicated that a mother is more aware of her normal child 2 ̆ 7 s self-concept than of her learning <b>disabled</b> <b>child</b> 2 ̆ 7 s self-concept. This implies that a mother should be informed or the importance of how attitude and parent-child interactions affect the perception of a learning <b>disabled</b> <b>child</b> 2 ̆ 7 s self-concept. (2) Basic in the life of a learning <b>disabled</b> <b>child</b> are maternal reactions. These reactions may negatively affect a child 2 ̆ 7 s self-concept and distort a mother 2 ̆ 7 s perception of her child 2 ̆ 7 s self-concept causing faulty relationships between mother and the child. The results of this study indicated that a mother is less aware of the learning <b>disabled</b> <b>child</b> 2 ̆ 7 s self-concept. This implies that educational counseling is needed in order to assist a mother in her dealings with the learning <b>disabled</b> <b>child.</b> Recommendations: The summary, findings, conclusions, and implications gave bases for the following recommendations: (1) In order to inform the mothers about the importance of their role in self-concept development and the importance that attitudes play in maternal perception of the self-concept, it is recommended that programs, workshops, and conferences should be designed and implemented by local schools systems and communities. (2) Because of the various maternal reactions toward the learning <b>disabled</b> <b>child</b> and the mother 2 ̆ 7 s distorted perceptions of the learning <b>disabled</b> <b>child</b> 2 ̆ 7 s self-concept, it is further recommended that parent counseling services should be made available by local and state agencies in the areas of learning disabilities. (3) It is also recommended that more research is needed in the area of maternal perception in order to provide a wider data base of knowledge. Perhaps the same type of study should be conducted utilizing a larger sample, another geographic area, a group of fathers and/or both parents...|$|R
