5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, a {{campaign}} to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who {{was concerned about the}} image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for solicitation. One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> all right was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.|$|E

Clark sustained a bloody nose but was not seriously hurt.|$|E

500|$|Many of Kogălniceanu's {{efforts were}} {{centered}} on bringing about {{an end to}} the peasant question, but, as he admitted, his boyar electorate threatened to recall <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to pursue this path any further. Consequently, he signed his name to the more moderate proposal of Dimitrie Rallet, which prevented boyars from instituting new corvées, while leaving other matters to be discussed by a future permanent Assembly. This project was instantly rejected by a solid majority of the Assembly, which in Kogălniceanu's view, {{led to the creation of}} two poles, [...] "national liberal" [...] and conservative, replacing the unionist-separatist divide and causing political conflicts inside the former unionist majority (thus forming the National Liberal and Conservative parties).|$|E
500|$|After the band's {{previous}} album Rocket to Russia saw poor album sales, drummer Tommy Ramone {{left his}} performing position to {{focus primarily on}} producing for the band. After Tommy suggested they {{search for a new}} drummer, they began looking in New York City based clubs. While at CBGB, Ramones bassist Dee Dee Ramone approached Marc Bell (Marky Ramone) – who had previously been the drummer in Richard Hell and the Voidoids – asking <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> interested in joining the Ramones. A month after this encounter, Bell was invited by Danny Fields and Monte Melnick to audition for the band. Around twenty others auditioned to be the drummer, with Tommy overseeing the final choice. Bell played [...] "I Don't Care" [...] and [...] "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker" [...] and each member agreed to allow him into the band.|$|E

500|$|Goaltender Jacques Plante {{had been}} wearing a mask during {{practices}} for some time, but did not wear it during games due to the objections of Blake and Selke who held the traditional view that players should not wear facial protection. That changed on [...] November 1, 1959, after he was struck in the face early in a game at Madison Square Garden. As teams did not dress backup goaltenders during this time, the game was delayed 20 minutes while doctors frantically stitched Plante up. When Blake asked <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> ready to return to play, Plante refused {{to return to the}} ice unless he was allowed to wear a mask. Blake was livid, but agreed only if Plante removed the mask when his face was healed. Wearing the mask, Plante led the Canadiens on an 18-game unbeaten streak. He finally removed the mask at Blake's urging and promptly lost the next game. Defeated, Blake relented. Plante's mask became a permanent fixture as he led the Canadiens to their fifth consecutive Stanley Cup. Other goalies followed Plante's lead soon after.|$|E
500|$|Douglas {{worked with}} a speech {{instructor}} on breath control {{in order to become}} better acclimatized to the fast rhythm of the film's dialogue. Early on in the shoot, Stone tested Douglas by enhancing his [...] "repressed anger", according to the actor. At one point, Stone came into Douglas' trailer and asked <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing drugs because [...] "you look like you haven't acted before". This shocked Douglas, who did more research and worked on his lines again and again, pushing himself harder than he had before. All of this hard work culminated with the [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech. Stone planned to use a Fortune magazine cover in exchange for promotional advertisements, but Forbes magazine made a similar offer. Stone stuck with Fortune, which upset Forbes publisher Malcolm Forbes, who turned down a later request to use his private yacht. Stone switched from 12- to 14-hour shooting days {{in the last few weeks}} in order to finish principal photography before an impending Directors Guild of America strike and finished five days ahead of schedule. Sheen remembered that Stone was always looking at the script and at his watch.|$|E
500|$|Troy Middleton was {{the fifth}} of nine {{children}} and grew {{up at the end}} of the 19th century on a 400-acre plantation in southeastern Copiah County. [...] The plantation was virtually a self-contained community, and he had a variety of chores to do depending on the season, with sausage-stuffing being one of his favorites. The local Lick Creek and Strong River had plentiful fish that he would catch, and he loved to hunt, particularly with his 12-gauge shotgun. [...] While his family was Episcopal by heritage, they worshiped at the Bethel Baptist Church, a few miles west of Georgetown, the only church reachable on a Sunday morning. [...] His education was conducted at the small Bethel schoolhouse, near the Bethel Church, but in the summertime he was tutored by his oldest sister Emily, who came home from Blue Mountain College to share her knowledge of different subjects with her family. [...] Having exhausted all the educational opportunities available at home, Middleton's father asked <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> interested in a college education. Finding this an attractive proposition, in the summer of 1904, at the age of fourteen, Middleton made the 172-mile train trip to Starkville, where he would begin his studies at Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (Mississippi A), later to become Mississippi State University.|$|E

500|$|Sinatra did {{not serve}} in the {{military}} during World War II. On December 11, 1943, he was officially classified 4-F ("Registrant not acceptable for military service") by his draft board because of a perforated eardrum. However, army files reported that Sinatra was [...] "not acceptable material from a psychiatric viewpoint", but his emotional instability was hidden to avoid [...] "undue unpleasantness for both the selectee and the induction service". Briefly, there were rumors reported by columnist Walter Winchell that Sinatra paid $40,000 to avoid the service, but the FBI found this to be without merit. Toward the end of the war, Sinatra entertained the troops during several successful overseas USO tours with comedian Phil Silvers. During one trip to Rome he met the Pope, who asked <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an operatic tenor. [...] Sinatra worked frequently with the popular Andrews Sisters in radio the 1940s, and many USO shows were broadcast to troops via the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS). In 1944 Sinatra released [...] "I Couldn't Sleep a Wink Last Night" [...] as a single and recorded his own version of Crosby's [...] "White Christmas", and the following year he released [...] "I Dream of You (More Than You Dream I Do)", [...] "Saturday Night (Is the Loneliest Night of the Week)", [...] "Dream" [...] and [...] "Nancy (with the Laughing Face)" [...] as singles.|$|E
500|$|The Florida Territorial Council {{passed laws}} forbidding interracial {{marriage}} {{and the right of}} free blacks or mixed race descendants to inherit property. To avoid difficulties with the new government in what he termed its [...] "spirit of intolerant prejudice", Kingsley sent his wives, children, and a few slaves to Haiti, by that time free black republic. [...] His two daughters had already each married white planters and remained in Florida. He sold the plantation to his nephew, Kingsley Beatty Gibbs in 1839, and transferred some of the slaves to his plantation in San Jose, now a neighborhood in Jacksonville. Kingsley started a plantation in Haiti that was worked by former Fort George Island slaves, who had become indentured servants; slavery was not allowed in Haiti. [...] They were to earn their freedom in nine years. In 1842 Kingsley gave an interview to the abolitionist Lydia Child. When she asked <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> aware that his occupation as a slave trader might be perceived as being akin to piracy, he responded [...] "Yes; and I am glad of it. They will look upon a slaveholder just so, by and by. Slave trading was a very respectable business when I was young. The first merchants in England and America were engaged in it. Some people hide things which they think other people don’t like. I never conceal anything." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the next}} match, Macartney scored 345 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in 232 minutes, with 47 fours and four sixes. Macartney had an inauspicious {{start to the}} day, coming to the crease after the {{dismissal}} of Warren Bardsley with only one run scored. He attacked immediately and was dropped in the slips when on nine runs. The missed chance further emboldened Macartney, who had a philosophy that being dropped was a signal {{that it was his}} day to shine. He proceeded to exhibit his full repertoire of strokes. After reaching his double century in only 150 minutes, Macartney signalled to the pavilion. When Nottinghamshire captain Arthur Carr asked <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> seeking a drink, Macartney said that he wanted a heavier bat and indicated {{that he was going to}} attack. Macartney kept his promise, adding his next 100 runs in only 48 minutes to reach 300 in 198 minutes. At the time, it was the fastest triple century in first-class cricket in terms of minutes. It still stands as the highest innings by an Australian in England, and at the time was the most runs scored by any batsman in one day. During the innings, Macartney partnered Nip Pellew in a partnership of 291. Australia went on to score 675 and won by an innings and 517 runs, in only two days, the largest winning margin achieved by Australia in a first-class match. The cricket writer Sumner Reid described Macartney's innings as: ...|$|E

500|$|Peter Buck's {{style of}} playing guitar has {{been singled out}} {{by many as the}} most {{distinctive}} aspect of R.E.M.'s music. During the 1980s, Buck's [...] "economical, arpeggiated, poetic" [...] style reminded British music journalists of 1960s American folk rock band The Byrds. Buck has stated [...] " [...] Roger McGuinn was a big influence on me as a guitar player", but said it was Byrds-influenced bands, including Big Star and The Soft Boys, that inspired him more. Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of Johnny Marr of alternative rock contemporaries The Smiths. While Buck professed being a fan of the group, he admitted he initially criticized the band simply because he was tired of fans asking <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> influenced by Marr, whose band had in fact made their debut after R.E.M. Buck generally eschews guitar solos; he explained in 2002, [...] "I know that when guitarists rip into this hot solo, people go nuts, but I don't write songs that suit that, and I am not interested in that. I can do it if I have to, but I don't like it." [...] Mike Mills' melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by Paul McCartney of The Beatles and Chris Squire of Yes; Mills has said, [...] "I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways [...] [...] [...] I never wanted to play the traditional locked into the kick drum, root note bass work." [...] Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said [...] "made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality." ...|$|E
