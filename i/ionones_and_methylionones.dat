40|$|International audiencebeta-Carotene is, when cleaved, an {{important}} source of flavor and aroma compounds in fruits and flowers. Among these aroma compounds, the main degradation products are beta-ionone, 5, 6 -epoxy-beta-ionone, and dihydroactinidiolide (DHA), which are associated by flavorists and perfumers with fruity, floral, and woody notes. These three species can be produced by degradation of beta-carotene through an attack by enzyme-generated free radicals and a cleavage at the C 9 -C 10 bond. This study investigated the influence of cis/trans isomerism at the C 9 -C 10 bond on the production of beta-carotene degradation compounds, first with a predictive approach and then experimentally with different isomer mixtures. beta-Carotene solutions containing high ratios of 9 -cis-isomers produced more DHA, suggesting a different pathway than for the transformation of all-trans-beta-carotene to <b>ionone</b> <b>and</b> DHA. These results are important in the search for financially viable processes to produce natural carotene-derived aroma compounds...|$|R

40|$|Rhodopsin is the {{photosensitive}} protein of the rod photoreceptor in the vertebrate retina and is {{a paradigm}} for the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Natural rhodopsin contains an 11 -cis-retinylidene chromophore. We have prepared the 9 -cis analogue isorhodopsin in a natural membrane environment using uniformly (13) C-enriched 9 -cis retinal. Subsequently, we have determined the complete (1) H and (13) C assignments with ultra-high field solid-state magic angle spinning NMR. The 9 -cis substrate conforms to the opsin binding pocket in isorhodopsin in a manner {{very similar to that}} of the 11 -cis form in rhodopsin, but the NMR data reveal an improper fit of the 9 -cis chromophore in this binding site. We introduce the term "induced misfit" to describe this event. Downfield proton NMR ligation shifts (Deltasigma(lig) (H) > 1 ppm) are observed for the 16, 17, 19 -H and nearby protons of the <b>ionone</b> ring <b>and</b> for the 9 -methyl protons.

The Deltasigma(lig) (C) pattern of the polyene chain confirms the positive charge delocalization in the polyene associated with the protonation of the Schiff base nitrogen. In line with the misalignment of the ionone ring, an additional and anomalous perturbation of the (13) C response is detected in the region of the 9 -cis bond. This provides evidence for strain in the isomerization region of the polyene and supports the hypothesis that perturbation of the conjugation around the cis bond induced by the protein environment assists the selective photoisomerization...|$|R
30|$|Terpenoids are {{the largest}} class of natural {{products}} in the plant kingdom. Their structural unit is isoprene, and the general formula is (C 5 H 8)n. Terpenoids have potential medicinal value and are widely used in the medicine, for example, paclitaxel, β-elemene, beta <b>ionone</b> <b>and</b> geraniol are used as anticancer drugs (Eisenreich et al. 1998; Hua and Cai 2006; Duncan et al. 2004). The precursors of terpenoids are five carbon compounds which are isoprene phosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), these two kinds of precursors were synthesized from a mevalonate (MVA) pathway (Chappell 1995) and a 2 -C-methyl-d-erythritol- 4 -phosphate (MEP) pathway (Lange et al. 1998) respectively. Compartmentalization of MVA pathway enzymes has been extensively studied in mammalian (Kovacs et al. 2002; Hogenboom et al. 2004; Wanders and Waterham 2006). In plants, there only exists fragmented experimental data regarding the localization of the MVA pathway enzymes (Sapir-Mir et al. 2008). Rodríguez-Concepción and Boronat (2015) pointed out that future efforts to address the regulation of isoprenoid metabolism must also {{take into account the}} spatial distribution of the biosynthetic pathways as well as the targeting and subcellular location of the enzyme isoforms involved, the intracellular transport of metabolic intermediates, and the different storage structures for end products (Rodríguez-Concepción and Boronat 2015). The acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AACT), or named acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (ACAT) is a kind of enzyme that catalyzes hydrolysis and condensation. In the MVA pathway, AACT is the initial enzyme to catalyze two acetyl CoA to produce acetyl acetyl CoA and is essential for terpenoid backbone biosynthesis. Soto et al. (2011) found that acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase is a regulatory enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis involved in abiotic stress adaptation (Soto et al. 2011). Jin et al. (2012) considered that the AACT 2 -derived acetoacetyl-CoA pool generates isoprenoids which are required for normal growth and development, and these cannot be generated from other compensatory isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways (Jin et al. 2012). Therefore, AACT is highly significant for basic researches on the cytochemistry of terpenoid synthesis and the mechanisms underlying major metabolic processes. Furthermore, the localization of AACT in plants has been also in controversy.|$|R

40|$|The Arabidopsis {{carotenoid}} cleavage dioxygenase 4 (AtCCD 4) is {{a negative}} regulator of the carotenoid content of seeds and has recently been suggested {{as a candidate for}} the generation of retrograde signals that are thought to derive from the cleavage of poly-cis-configured carotene desaturation intermediates. In this work, we investigated the activity of AtCCD 4 in vitro and used dynamic modeling to determine its substrate preference. Our results document strict regional specificity for cleavage at the C 9 –C 10 double bond in carotenoids and apocarotenoids, with preference for carotenoid substrates and an obstructing effect on hydroxyl functions, and demonstrate the specificity for all-trans-configured carotenes and xanthophylls. AtCCD 4 cleaved substrates with at least one <b>ionone</b> ring <b>and</b> did not convert acyclic carotene desaturation intermediates, independent of their isomeric states. These results do not support a direct involvement of AtCCD 4 in generating the supposed regulatory metabolites. In contrast, the strigolactone biosynthetic enzyme AtCCD 7 converted 9 -cis-configured acyclic carotenes, such as 9 -cis-ζ-carotene, 9 '-cis-neurosporene, and 9 -cis-lycopene, yielding 9 -cis-configured products and indicating that AtCCD 7, rather than AtCCD 4, is the candidate for forming acyclic retrograde signals...|$|R
40|$|Osmanthus fragrans Lour. {{is one of}} the top 10 {{traditional}} ornamental {{flowers in}} China famous for its unique fragrance. Preliminary study proved that the terpenoids including <b>ionone,</b> linalool, <b>and</b> ocimene and their derivatives are the dominant aroma-active compounds that contribute greatly to the scent bouquet. Pollination observation implies the emission of aromatic terpenoids may follow a circadian rhythm. In this study, we investigated the variation of volatile terpenoids and its potential regulators. The results showed that both volatile and non-volatile terpenoids presented circadian oscillation with high emission or accumulation during the day and low emission or accumulation during the night. The volatile terpenoids always increased to reach their maximum values at 12 : 00 h, while free and glycosylated compounds continued increasing throughout the day. The depletion of non-volatile pool might provide the substrates for volatile emission at 0 : 00 – 6 : 00, suggesting the sequestration of non-volatile compounds acted like a buffer regulating emission of terpenoids. Further detection of MEP pathway genes demonstrated that their expressions increased significantly in parallel with the evident increase of both volatile and non-volatile terpenoids during the day, indicating that the gene expressions were also closely associated with terpenoid formation. Thus, the expression of MEP pathway genes and internal sequestration both played crucial roles in modulating circadian rhythm of terpenoid emission in O. fragrans...|$|R

40|$|Rhodopsin is {{a member}} of the {{superfamily}} of G-protein-coupled receptors. This seven alpha-helix transmembrane protein is the visual pigment of the vertebrate rod photoreceptor cells that mediate dim light vision. In the active binding site of this protein the ligand or chromophore, 11 -cis-retinal, is covalently bound via a protonated Schiff base to lysine residue 296. Here we present the complete (1) H and (13) C assignments of the 11 -cis-retinylidene chromophore in its ligand-binding site determined with ultra high field magic angle spinning NMR. Native bovine opsin was regenerated with 99 % enriched uniformly (13) C-labeled 11 -cis-retinal. From the labeled pigment, (13) C carbon chemical shifts could be obtained by using two-dimensional radio frequency-driven dipolar recoupling in a solid-state magic angle spinning homonuclear correlation experiment. The (1) H chemical shifts were assigned by two-dimensional heteronuclear ((1) H-(13) C) dipolar correlation spectroscopy with phase-modulated Lee-Goldburg homonuclear (1) H decoupling applied during the t(1) period. The data indicate nonbonding interactions between the protons of the methyl groups of the retinylidene <b>ionone</b> ring <b>and</b> the protein. These nonbonding interactions are attributed to nearby aromatic acid residues Phe- 208, Phe- 212, and Trp- 265 that are in close contact with, respectively, H- 16 /H- 17 and H- 18.

40|$|Rod {{vision is}} {{initiated}} when 11 -cis-retinal, bound within rhodopsin, absorbs a photon and isomerizes to all-trans-retinal (ATR). This triggers an enzyme cascade that lowers cGMP, thereby closing cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels. ATR then dissociates from rhodopsin, with bright light releasing millimolar levels of ATR. We have recently shown that ATR {{is a potent}} closed-state inhibitor of the rod CNG channel, and that it requires access to the cytosolic face of the channel (McCabe, S. L., D. M. Pelosi, M. Tetreault, A. Miri, W. Nguitragool, P. Kovithvathanaphong, R. Mahajan, and A. L. Zimmerman. 2004. J. Gen. Physiol. 123 : 521 – 531). However, {{the details of the}} interaction between the channel and ATR have not been resolved. Here, we explore the nature of this interaction by taking advantage of specific retinoids and retinoid analogues, namely, β-ionone, all-trans-C 15 aldehyde, all-trans-C 17 aldehyde, all-trans-C 22 aldehyde, all-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinoic acid, and all-trans-retinylidene-n-butylamine. These retinoids differ in polyene chain length, chemical functionality, and charge. Results obtained from patch clamp and NMR studies have allowed us to better define the characteristics of the site of retinoid–channel interaction. We propose that the cytoplasmic face of the channel contains a retinoid binding site. This binding site likely contains a hydrophobic region that allows the <b>ionone</b> ring <b>and</b> polyene tail to sit in an optimal position to promote interaction of the terminal functional group with residues ∼ 15 Å away from the ionone ring. Based on our functional data with retinoids possessing either a positive or a negative charge, we speculate that these amino acid residues may be polar and/or aromatic...|$|R
