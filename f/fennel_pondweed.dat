40|$|Many birds feed on {{submerged}} macrophytes {{during a}} temporally discrete period every year, for instance during migratory stopover {{or at the}} wintering grounds. Hence, seasonal herbivory is a common feature {{of the life cycle}} in many aquatic macrophytes. We are interested in the effect of Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) feeding on the tubers of <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus) in the Netherlands every autumn. For that purpose, we developed a sequential macrophyte population model, including seasons of tuber production, herbivory and winter mortality as distinct and unambiguously defined events. The model is characterised and parameterised with both field and laboratory data. Tuber consumption inevitably decreases the density of ramets sprouting next spring, but it may actually increase the density of tubers produced in the following autumn. Hence, we can only understand the effect of grazing on the <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> population by recognising the seasonal structure of density-dependence. The mean density of <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> and the yield taken by swans are dependent on the foraging threshold below which no grazing takes place.

40|$|In clonal plants, {{vegetative}} parts may outcompete {{seeds in}} the absence of disturbance, limiting the build-up of genotypic diversity through repeated seedling recruitment (RSR). Herbivory may provide disturbance and trigger establishment of strong colonizers (seeds) at the expense of strong competitors (clonal propagules). In the clonal aquatic <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus), two distinct herbivore guilds may modify the dynamics of propagation. In winter, Bewick's swans may deplete patches of tubers, promoting seedling establishment in spring. In summer, seed consumption by waterfowl can reduce the density of viable seeds but grazing may also reduce tuber production and hence facilitate seedling establishment. This study is among the first to experimentally test herbivore impact on plant genotypic diversity. We assess the separate and combined effects of both herbivore guilds on genotypic diversity and structure of <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> beds. Using microsatellites, we genotyped P. pectinatus from an exclosure experiment and assessed the contribution of herbivory, dispersal, and sexual reproduction to the population genetic structure. Despite the predominance of clonal propagation in P. pectinatus, we found considerable genotypic diversity. Within the experimental blocks, kinship among genets decreased with geographic distance, clearly identifying a role for RSR in the maintenance of genotypic diversity within the <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> beds. However, over a period of 5 years, none of the herbivory treatments affected genotypic diversity. Hence, sexual reproduction on a local scale is important in this putatively clonal plant and possibly sufficient to ensure a relatively high genotypic diversity even {{in the absence of}} herbivores.

40|$|The role {{of aquatic}} macrophytes in {{stimulating}} biodiversity and maintaining clear waters is currently undisputed. The management of (eutrophic) shallow waters is therefore often directed at (re-) establishing macrophyte domination. In contrast, {{the role of}} water birds has long been considered of minor importance for the functioning of fresh water ecosystems. Indeed, in terms of biomass and production, water birds constitute only a minor part of these systems. However, water birds may graze heavily on water plants under certain circumstances, and the question arises whether herbivorous water birds have an important indirect effect on shallow fresh water systems. Mainly illustrated with the interaction between Bewick’s Swans and <b>Fennel</b> <b>Pondweed,</b> we present data on the role that water plants may play {{in the life of}} water birds and how water birds may impact water plants’ fitness in terms of survival, production, dispersal and competitive ability. It appears that water plants may be crucial for water birds during periods of high-energy requirements, such as migration. Despite the plants’ costs associated with water bird grazing, the interaction between water birds and water plants varies in nature from an apparent predator–prey relationship to a mutually beneficial interaction depending on the context and the perspective. For the case of the Bewick’s Swan–Fennel Pondweed interaction, regular bird grazing is sustainable and may actually favour the plant’s dispersal. Thus, Bewick’s Swans themselves may in fact {{play a crucial role in}} establishing and maintaining the <b>Fennel</b> <b>Pondweed</b> rich staging sites between the swans’ wintering and breeding grounds, which are vital for the swans’ successful migration. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Deep burial in the {{sediment}} of tubers of <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus) has been {{explained in terms}} of avoidance by escape against consumption by Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) in autumn. We therefore expected changes in foraging pressure to ultimately result in a change in the tuber distribution across sediment depth. A trade-off underlies this idea: deep tubers are less accessible to swans but must be larger to meet the higher energy demands of sprouting in spring. To test this prediction, we compared tuber burial depth over a gradient of foraging pressure both across space and across time. Tuber samples were obtained after aboveground plant senescence but before arrival of Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s swans. First, we compared the current tuber bank depth profile in a shallow lake with high foraging pressure, the Lauwersmeer, with that in two wetlands with moderate and low foraging pressure. Second, we compared the current tuber burial in the Lauwersmeer with that in the early 1980 s when exploitation by swans had just started there. In accordance with our hypothesis, we found significantly deeper burial of tubers under high consumption risk compared to low consumption risk, both when comparing sites and comparing time periods. Since tubers in effect only survive to the next spring, the observed differences in burial depth among sites and over time cannot be a direct result of tuber losses due to consumption by swans. Rather, these observations suggest adaptive responses in tuber burial related to foraging pressure from Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s swans in the recent past. We thus propose that <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> exhibits flexible avoidance by escape, of a kind rarely described for plants, where both phenotypic plasticity and genotype sorting may contribute to the observed differences in tuber burial. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Organisms usually {{benefit from}} {{heterogeneous}} conditions, but, by doing so, {{may reduce the}} degree of heterogeneity. The question therefore arises how heterogeneity is maintained. We investigated within-year spatiotemporal patterns in a monospecific stand of a submerged plant (<b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed,</b> Potamogeton pectinatus), with the novelty that we distinguished between different forms of heterogeneity: spatial variance (the frequency distribution of densities) and spatial pattern (the spatial distribution of densities). We repeatedly measured plant biomass that was affected by swan predation, winter mortality, and summer regrowth. Spatial variance was enhanced mostly by swan foraging, {{despite the fact that}} swans appear to exploit patches to the same threshold level. Spatial pattern, which had vanished after swan foraging, reestablished due to spatial pattern in winter mortality and was further enhanced by plant regrowth. We found that variance and pattern each have their own temporal dynamics and are maintained by different biological processes. We therefore advocate that it is pivotal to distinguish between variance and pattern in the study of spatial heterogeneity. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the effect of summer bird herbivory on the belowground tuber formation of <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus L.). Cumulative grazing pressure of four waterfowl species (mute swans, mallards, gadwalls and coots) in the summer was calculated based on timing of grazing and body mass of the grazers. The resulting grazing pressures were significantly negatively correlated with mean autumn tuber biomass {{in three of the}} four years of study. Moreover, summer grazing pressures explained more of the variance in tuber densities than water depth, sediment particle size distribution or any interactions of these variables did in the same three years. We propose that herbivory early in the summer has the most substantial impact on the clonal reproduction of macrophytes. Herbivores with a high consumption rate and early congregation for moulting may be the key waterfowl species in diminishing propagule biomass. Hence, they may present pre-emptive, time-staggered competition to consumers of the belowground biomass in autumn, such as migratory swans and diving ducks. ...|$|E
40|$|Measuring {{the food}} left in {{experimental}} trays when study organisms cease feeding on them [so-called giving-up densities (GUDs) ] is an accepted technique for assessing predation risk and disturbance. However, in natural settings, accessibility and energetic harvest costs may vary spatially, and GUDs may be confounded. In this study, we assessed whether at a heterogeneous site, non-experimental GUDs could reveal {{the effect of}} disturbance. We measured initial and GUDs of tubers of <b>Fennel</b> <b>Pondweed</b> Potamogeton pectinatus, which form here the exclusive food source of Bewick's Swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii during their migratory stopover. We calculated giving-up net energy intake rates (GUNs) by correcting for biomass accessibility and foraging costs. The study area was a shallow lake consisting of nine creeks, three of which were {{open to the public}} (i. e. disturbed). GUDs in creeks open or closed to the public were not significantly different. In contrast, GUNs were generally higher in creeks open to the public, after correcting for initial net energy intake rate. The results suggest that natural GUDs may not reflect the effects of disturbance in heterogeneous habitats. When environmental differences are large within a site, GUNs may be a useful alternative as a behavioural indicator. ...|$|E
40|$|Current {{models of}} bird {{migration}} consider the optimal decision making of individuals {{irrespective of the}} behaviour of conspecifics. We observed the foraging behaviour of Bewick's Swans Cygnus columbianus during their stop-over in the Dvina Bay in the White Sea in spring 1995 and 1996. Here the swans could only feed on their main food, tubers of <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> Potamogeton pectinatus. during low tide. In {{the course of the}} staging period, the swans tended to forage at progressively lower water levels, indicating that they depleted their main food and exploited increasingly deeper parts of the tuber-bank. This reduced the swans' main foraging period from 6. 0 h/tide on 20 May to 3. 3 h/tide on 28 May 1996. We calculated that this must have greatly decreased the rate of refuelling during the staging period. In accordance with this, swans arriving early stayed shorter than those arriving late. It seems of paramount importance to the swans to arrive as early as possible at the stop-over site. We conclude that when food depletion occurs, a game theoretical approach is needed to improve our understanding of the birds' adaptive behaviour during their migration.

Microbial processes catalyzing nutrient recycling and CH 4 production are controlled by sediment physico-chemistry, which is in turn affected by plant activity and the foraging behaviour of herbivores. We performed field and laboratory experiments to evaluate the direct effect of herbivores on soil microbial activity and their indirect effects as the consequence of reduced macrophyte density, using migratory Bewick’s swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii Yarrell) feeding on <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) tubers as a model system. A controlled foraging experiment using field enclosures indicated that swan bioturbation decreases CH 4 production, through a decrease in the activity of methanogenic Archaea and an increased rate of CH 4 oxidation in the bioturbated sediment. We also found a positive correlation between tuber density (a surrogate of plant density during the previous growth season) and CH 4 production activity. A laboratory experiment showed that sediment sterilization enhances pondweed growth, probably due to elimination of the negative effects of microbial activity on plant growth. In summary, the bioturbation caused by swan grazing modulates CH 4 cycling by means of both direct and indirect (i. e. plant-mediated) effects with potential consequences for CH 4 emission from wetland systems. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} in which high-density food patches are found {{is determined by}} the way foragers move between patches. In this study we explore the effect of social interactions on the foraging path, in particular the distance moved between patches. We studied Bewick¿s Swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii that foraged on belowground tubers of <b>Fennel</b> <b>Pondweed</b> Potamogeton pectinatus. We accurately mapped the foraging path of individual swans and determined the distances between visited patches. 24 % of inter-patch movements are associated with social interactions. When a swan retreats from a patch because it is chased away by another swan, it moves a significantly larger distance to a patch than if the movement is not associated with a social interaction. Such longer movements are thought to reduce the rate at which high-density patches are encountered, and thus the energy gain rate a swan can achieve. We observed a strong social hierarchy in which families are dominant over pairs and singletons, and pairs are dominant over singletons, which represents a producer¿scrounger model. Singletons were most frequently observed to retreat from patches and are consequently thought to achieve the lowest gain rates, and also as a result exhibit the slowest speed of movement between patches. However singletons might partly compensate for more frequent retreats from patches by moving larger distances to arrive at the front edge of a flock where they encounter unexploited resources...|$|E
40|$|One way {{to express}} {{the value of a}} natural habitat is its {{capacity}} to harbour a particular target species. In the case of migratory birds, the cumulative number of birds that can be accommodated at a site for a given period of time (‘bird-days’) became an accepted currency for this carrying capacity. However, there is no general consensus on the factors determining the number of bird-days. By focusing on Bewick’s swans (Cygnus bewickii) foraging on tubers of <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus) in the Lauwersmeer, the Netherlands, this thesis investigates which factors are relevant in shaping the number of migratory waterbirds using a stopover site. First of all, the results revealed that, in a heterogeneous environment, predictions about consumer numbers cannot rely exclusively on the amount of available food: accessibility, harvest rates and foraging costs should be included. These factors can be combined together in a single measure, the locally achievable net energy intake rate, which proved to be a good proxy for explaining the distribution of animals. This currency also provided evidence that swans exploit human-disturbed parts to a lower extent. On the other hand, the resulting lower swan densities at these parts offer first-winter swans the possibility to compensate for their lower feeding efficiency: they follow a risk-prone behaviour and select these disturbed, but largely unexploited foraging patches. The use of bird-days as a currency assumes that the effects of interference competition on individual intake rates is negligible. Previous work had shown that the effect of interference competition was largely dependent on how food is distributed in the environment. Experiments with ducks revealed that in a spatially autocorrelated, slightly clumped food distribution, resembling the natural situation, differences in intake rate between group or solitary foragers, or between dominants and subordinates are small. In addition, Bewick’s swans avoid forming high competitor densities in the field, thereby minimize the effects of interference competition. Hence, the mean population intake rate at observed competitor densities is only slightly lower than achieved in the absence of interference. Therefore, bird-days may be an appropriate unit for expressing the carrying capacity of the Lauwersmeer for Bewick’s swans. The available tuber density is also shaped by interspecific competition (i. e., with other species). Based on field observations, it was hypothesized that pochards (Aythya ferina) kleptoparasitize Bewick’s swans. However, a controlled experiment revealed that pochards only glean food items that float away from the swans and are not stealing. Hence, swans and diving ducks form a commensalistic relationship, with none suffering from the other species. In contrast, summer herbivores, such as mute swans (Cygnus olor), which consume aboveground vegetation of <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed,</b> indirectly reduce the tuber stock available for Bewick’s swans in the autumn. In order to predict patterns in complex ecological environments certain simplifications are inevitable.

40|$|Interference can {{be defined}} as the {{reduction}} of intake rate caused by the presence of congeneric individuals. However, surrounding congeneric individuals may also accelerate food depletion. Therefore, it is difficult to quantify interference (contest) and exploitative (scramble) competition separately, particularly in the field. In an individual-based model, where food was immediately replenished in patches after a foraging bout, we isolated the effect of interference competition. In this way, we investigated how interference shapes the intake rates of flocking Bewick’s swans, Cygnus bewickii, consuming tubers of <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed,</b> Potamogeton pectinatus. The model predicted that intake rate declines with increasing swan density, and that the rate of decline is greater in subordinate birds than in dominant birds. Subordinate birds suffered a large reduction in intake rate at high densities because they spent {{a large proportion of the}} time avoiding more dominant individuals. A major decline in intake rate of subordinates occurred close to the maximum swan densities observed in the field. We expected subordinates to leave high-density flocks and look for another foraging location: interference competition seemed to regulate the maximum swan flock density in the field. Hence, the mean population intake rate at realized densities was only slightly lower than in the absence of interference. As interference occurred mainly as avoidance behaviour, which is difficult to observe in the field, it might commonly remain cryptic for the observer. Our results may explain other field studies where interference competition seemed to be of lesser importance. ...|$|E
40|$|Deeper {{burial of}} bulbs and tubers has been {{suggested}} as an escape against below-ground herbivory by vertebrates, but experimental evidence is lacking. As deep propagule burial can incur high costs of emergence after dormancy, burial depth may represent a trade-off between sprouting survival and herbivore avoidance. We tested whether burial depth of subterraneous tubers is a flexible trait in <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus), facing tuber predation by Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) in shallow lakes in winter. In a four-year experiment involving eight exclosures, winter herbivory by swans and all vertebrate summer herbivory were excluded in a full-factorial design; we hence controlled for aboveground vertebrate herbivory in summer, possibly influencing tuber depth. Tuber depth was measured each September before swan arrival and each March before tuber sprouting. In accordance with our hypothesis, tuber depth in September decreased after excluding Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s swans in comparison to control plots. The summer exclosure showed an increase in tuber biomass {{and the number of}} shallow tubers, but not a significant effect on the mean burial depth of tuber mass. Our results suggest that a clonal plant like P. pectinatus can tune the tuber burial depth to predation pressure, either by phenotypic plasticity or genotype sorting, hence exhibiting flexible avoidance by escape. We suggest that a flexible propagule burial depth can be an effective herbivore avoidance strategy, which might be more widespread among tuber forming plant species than previously thought. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Learning {{animals are}} {{predicted}} {{to use a}} flexible patch-leaving threshold (PLT) while foraging in a depletable environment under exploitative competition. This prediction was tested in flock-feeding Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) depleting hidden tubers of <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus) in a two-dimensional, continuous environment. The swans' patch residence time was measured by combining recordings of the foraging behaviour and movement paths. The tuber biomass density was measured {{before and after the}} period of exploitation, using the presumable foraging window of the swans as the scale of measurement. Swan foraging was simulated in order to predict the effects of flexible and fixed PLTs, respectively, on the patch residence time and the spatial heterogeneity of the tuber biomass density. Flexible PLTs were predicted to lead to short and decreasing patch residence times and a decrease in the coefficient of variation in tuber biomass densities, whereas the reverse was generally the case for fixed PLTs. Observed patch residence times did not decrease with time and were intermediate between those predicted for swans with flexible and fixed PLTs. Furthermore, an increase of the coefficient of variation in the tuber biomass density was observed. Given the observed giving-up biomass densities the most likely model was one with swans with a fixed rather than a flexible PLT. These results point at factors that may affect the spacing behaviour or constrain the use of a flexible PLT in swans. ...|$|E
40|$|The daily metabolizable energy {{intake of}} an animal is {{potentially}} limited by either the available feeding time or by its capacity to process energy. Animals are generally considered not to be time-limited but rather to be energy-processing-limited.

We argue that such changes in feeding time are in theory also expected when no constraints are operating. Thus, {{a study of the}} constraints on energy intakes of free-living animals should be performed during demanding phases of the year. As an example, we collected data on time and energy budgets of Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) refuelling during migration on <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus) tubers in two years differing two-fold in tuber biomass density. As predicted by time limitation, the feeding time (defined as the time with the head submerged) did not change in response to a change in food biomass density, both within and between years (averaging 12. 2 h d − 1). Contrary to energy-processing limitation, and again in line with time limitation, the daily metabolizable energy intake varied, being greater in the year with high than in the year with low food densities. We conclude that more studies are needed of animals operating under demanding conditions before it can be assessed whether free-living animals are generally energy-processing- or time-limited. <br /...|$|E

Two and five complete tracks were recorded in spring and autunm, respectively, showing that the White Sea was visited for c. 2 weeks in spring, but by-passed (or visited {{for a few days}} at the most) in autumn. Skipping of the White Sea in autumn was predicted by a dynamic programming model which was based on calculated gain rates during stopover in the Pechora Delta and the White Sea. This prediction was not sensitive to plausible variations in gain rates. Relative to the Pechora Delta the White Sea is a poor site because a large tidal amplitude precludes foraging on the beds of the submerged macrophyte <b>Fennel</b> <b>Pondweed</b> Potamogeton pectinatus during high tide. The dynamic programming model predicted a fast autunm migration. However, the phenology of autunm arrival dates of Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s Swans on the wintering grounds revealed that only in three out of ten years a significant number of birds was able to reach the wintering grounds without refuelling.

40|$|Many {{migratory birds}} use {{a chain of}} {{stopover}} sites to fuel their migration. Under time-minimizing migration, fuelling time and giving-up density at stopovers are predicted to depend on fuelling conditions. Fluctuations in food accessibility likely lead to changes in fuelling conditions, which should in turn be reflected in fuelling time and giving-up density. During their migration, Bewick’s Swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii refuel on belowground tubers of <b>Fennel</b> <b>Pondweed</b> Potamogeton pectinatus in shallow lakes. We studied giving-up density and stop-over use (expressed in bird-days) of Bewick's Swans at an autumn stopover site (Lauwersmeer, The Netherlands) during 1995 – 2008, as dependent on local environmental conditions. High water levels were hypothesized to restrict access to tuber stocks. High water levels at the stopover site were predicted to lead to higher giving-up densities and less bird-days spent at the stopover. Annual variation in giving-up densities and number of bird-days was strongly associated with year-to-year differences in initial tuber biomass density and number of days with high water levels. As predicted, giving-up density increased and bird-days decreased {{with the number of}} days with high water level. We conclude that, in line with time-minimizing migration, changes in fuelling conditions may lead to underuse of a stopover site. Underuse of stopovers by migratory birds has been reported before but only in the sense that more food was left at stopover sites than at wintering sites. In contrast, in our case, dealing with a given stopover site, more food is left behind in some years than in other years. ...|$|E

We studied a population of P. pectinatus in which genotypes producing large tubers predominate at the sandy shore and those producing small tubers at the clay-rich shore. Clonal lines originating from different shores were grown on a sandy and a clay-rich substrate in a common-garden. Plants from all clonal lines were grown from tubers of a comparable size range, but the various clones from within each shore differed in the average size of tubers they are genetically determined to produce. The performance of all clones was much lower on sandy substrate than on clay-rich substrate, indicating that the former is a stressful (nutrient-poor) environment. The reaction norms of morphological traits varied significantly among clones, revealing genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity. However, these differences were not related to our correlates of fitness (total tuber biomass, tuber size and tuber number).

However, in the field there are likely to be factors modulating the functional response. In this study previously published results of experiments on captive Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s swans were used to obtain functional responses of swans digging for tubers of <b>Fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> on different foraging substrates: sandy and clayey sediment, and in shallow and deep water. In a field study, four 250 × 250 m sections belonging to different types (sandy–shallow, clayey–shallow, sandy–deep and clayey–deep) were delineated. Here tubers were sampled with sediment corers in three years, both before and after swan exploitation in autumn, and swans were observed and mapped from a hide in two of these years. Giving-up tuber biomass densities varied among sections. Substitution of these giving-up densities in the derived patch-type-specific functional responses yielded the quitting net energy intake rates in the four sections. As expected from the marginal value theorem, the quitting net energy intake rates did not vary among sections. Moreover, the observed foraging pressure (total foraging time per area) per patch type was in quantitative agreement with the integrated functional responses.

At the population level I show that the degree of compensation to herbivory by the clonal pondweed Potamogeton pectinatus strongly depends on the timing of herbivory. Herbivory on aboveground biomass in summer reduces plant biomass and tuber production severely whereas predation on tubers in winter by Bewick 's swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii is largely compensated for. Despite this high tolerance to winter herbivory, <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> may exhibit a flexible avoidance strategy towards tuber predation by burying tubers deeper in the sediment in the presence of swans. Since deeper burial in the sediment is costly, pondweed trades competitive strength for safety from herbivores. I present support for this idea from field studies and an exclosure experiment. The extent to which species can adjust to changes in herbivore pressure is constrained by the limits of phenotypic plasticity and microevolution. Therefore, at the community level, trade-offs may allow coexistence of different strategies thus stimulating functional diversity when herbivory is heterogeneous in space and time. In addition, herbivory may influence interspecific competition itself possibly leading to drastic changes within aquatic plant communities. This may especially be the case when species are ecosystem engineers. This may be the case in the competition between charophytes (macroalgae) and pondweeds which is shown from mesocosm studies...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} the patch use behaviour of Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) feeding on below ground tubers of <b>fennel</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus). We compared the swans' attack rates, foraging costs and giving-up densities (GUDs) in natural and experimental food patches that differed in water depth. Unlike most studies that attribute habitat-specific differences in GUDs to predation risk, food quality or foraging substrate, we quantified {{the relative importance}} of energetic costs and accessibility. Accessibility is defined as {{the extent to which the}} animal's morphology restricts its harvest of all food items within a food patch. Patch use behaviours were measured at shallow (ca 0. 4 m) and deep (ca 0. 6 m) water depths on sandy sediments. In a laboratory foraging experiment, when harvesting food patches, the swan's attack rate (m 3 s 1) did not differ between depths. In deep water the energetic costs of surfacing, feeding and trampling were 1. 13 to 1. 21 times higher than in shallow water with a tendency to spend relatively more time trampling, the most expensive activity. Taking time allocation as measured in the field into account, foraging in deep water was 1. 26 times as expensive as in shallow water. In the lake the GUD in shallow water was on average 12. 9 g m 2. If differences in energetic costs were the only factor determining differences in GUDs, then the deep water GUD should be 14. 2 g m 2. Instead, the mean GUD in deep water was 20. 2 g m 2, and therefore energetic costs explain just 18 % of the difference in GUDs. At deep sites, 24 % of tuber biomass was estimated to be out of reach, and we calculated a maximum accessible foraging depth of 0. 86 m. This is close to the published 0. 84 m based on body measurements. A laboratory experiment with food offered at a depth of 0. 89 m confirmed that it was just out of reach. The agreement between calculated and observed maximum accessible foraging depths suggests that accessibility largely explains the remaining difference in GUDs with depth, and it confirms the existence of partial prey refuges in this system. ...|$|E
