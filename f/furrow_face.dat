60|$|The sailors departed, {{and with}} {{something}} of a grim smile on his <b>furrowed</b> <b>face</b> {{the owner of the}} Peacock dropped into a seat near the companionway door. He had just started to speak again when there was a noise outside and Arnold Baxter appeared.|$|R
60|$|The shoes evidently {{refused to}} respond any {{further to the}} old man's efforts at {{polishing}} them. He contemplated them now, with a whimsical look of regret on his <b>furrowed</b> <b>face,</b> then set them {{down on the floor}} and slipped his stockinged feet into them.|$|R
25|$|Using modern 3-D technology, {{a facial}} {{reconstruction}} {{has been created}} for the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy. It shows Ötzi looking old for his 45 years, with deep-set brown eyes, a beard, a <b>furrowed</b> <b>face,</b> and sunken cheeks. He is depicted looking tired and ungroomed.|$|R
60|$|Old Jolyon's <b>furrowed</b> <b>face</b> was {{reddening}} patchily, as old men's faces redden in the sun. He {{took one}} of Jolly's hands in his own; the boy climbed on to his knee; and little Holly, mesmerized by this sight, crept up to them; {{the sound of the}} dog Balthasar's scratching arose rhythmically.|$|R
60|$|Wyllard {{stood looking}} at them {{for a moment or}} two with a <b>furrowed</b> <b>face</b> and a hand that the frost had split tightly clenched. It was evident that they could haul the hampering load no further, and he was troubled by an almost insupportable weariness. Then he made a little unwilling sign of concurrence.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he turned}} and saw, as he had partly expected, a {{quartermaster}} standing {{just inside the door}} above him, and with a word or two to his second he crawled back up the ladder and went with the man to the room beneath the bridge. The young skipper who stood there with a <b>furrowed</b> <b>face</b> regarded him grimly.|$|R
60|$|When {{he reached}} the end of the <b>furrows</b> his <b>face</b> was grim, but he {{steadily}} continued his plowing.|$|R
60|$|So far the {{questions}} and answers had followed on one another in quick succession. Sir Thomas Ryder, with his clever lean head held somewhat on one side, appeared to be reciting a well-learned lesson, so even and placid was {{the tone of his}} voice and so indifferent the expression of his <b>furrowed</b> <b>face.</b> One leg was crossed over the other and his tapering hands, white and wrinkled like his face, toyed with a large ivory paper knife hardly whiter in colour than they.|$|R
60|$|The {{meeting with}} his new daughter-in-law {{took place in the}} dining-room. James was seated by the fire when she was brought in. He placed, his hands on the arms of the chair and slowly raised himself. Stooping and immaculate in his frock-coat, thin as a line in Euclid, he {{received}} Annette's hand in his; and the anxious eyes of his <b>furrowed</b> <b>face,</b> which had lost its colour now, doubted above her. A little warmth came into them and into his cheeks, refracted from her bloom.|$|R
60|$|The calculating {{patron of}} the Winkelried had patiently watched the {{progress}} of the foregoing scene with great inward satisfaction, but now that the strangers seemed to be assured of support powerful as that of Melchior de Willading, he was disposed to turn it to account without farther delay. The old men were still standing with their hands grasping each other, after another warm and still closer embrace, and with tears rolling down the <b>furrowed</b> <b>face</b> of each, when Baptiste advanced to put in his raven-like remonstrance.|$|R
60|$|But {{the most}} {{characteristic}} {{figure in the}} whole picture was that of an aged woman, who sat quietly rocking to and fro in a great chair {{by the side of}} a large round table covered with books. There was a quiet beauty in that placid face--that silvery hair brushed neatly under the snowy border of the cap. Every line in that <b>furrowed</b> <b>face</b> told some tale of sorrow long assuaged, and passions hushed to rest, as on the calm ocean shore the golden-furrowed sand shows traces of storms and fluctuations long past.|$|R
60|$|He {{glanced at}} the little group of daintily attired, soft-handed {{men and women on}} board the launch, to whom the stress of {{physical}} labor was an unknown thing, and then looked back towards the coal-grimed toilers on the lighter. As yet they worked on stubbornly, with tense <b>furrowed</b> <b>faces,</b> under a scorching sun, taxing to the uttermost every muscle in their bodies, but {{it seemed to him that}} the lighter was no further from the reef. He flung an arm up, and hailed them, for he had acquired a working acquaintance with several Latin languages on the fever coast.|$|R
60|$|They {{went down}} to the first of the timber, and, {{spreading}} their blankets in a cranny of the rocks, built a great fire soon after darkness fell. Weston, who made the fire, filled the blackened kettle with water from the creek, and Grenfell, who crouched beside the snapping branches, also left him to prepare the supper. They had been on their feet since sunrise, and it was evident that he was very weary. He recovered a little when he had eaten, but he leaned back against the wet rock with a <b>furrowed</b> <b>face</b> when Weston took out his pipe.|$|R
50|$|Wrighton {{worked as}} a {{photographer}} {{only a few years}} with his 8 × 10 inches camera in the years 1986 to 1988 in his hometown and the closer environment. In these years, three series of photographs were made: one-time portraits, showing portraits of the inhabitants and the workers of Binghamton with their <b>furrowed</b> <b>faces</b> and worn-out clothing. In the second series Dinosaurs and Dreamboats, he portrayed the classic American streetcrosses of the 1950s in front of the urban architecture of this time in Binghamton. The third collection of photographs of St. George and the Dragon shows the motifs found in Binghamton and its surroundings, such as churches, pubs or apartments.|$|R
60|$|No one {{replied to}} his jocularity. Gaston Isbel's eyes narrowed to a slit in his <b>furrowed</b> <b>face</b> {{and he kept}} them {{fastened}} upon Greaves's store. Blue, likewise, had a somber cast of countenance, not, perhaps, any darker nor grimmer than those of his comrades, but more representative of intense preoccupation of mind. The look of him thrilled Jean, who could sense its deadliness, yet could not grasp any more. Altogether, {{the manner of the}} villagers and the watchful pacing to and fro of the Jorth followers and the silent, boding front of Isbel and his men summed up for Jean the menace of the moment that must very soon change to a terrible reality.|$|R
60|$|He {{broke off}} with a vague gesture, and sat looking at the others vacantly with his lean <b>face</b> <b>furrowed.</b>|$|R
60|$|Brott was pale, {{and deep}} new lines were <b>furrowed</b> on his <b>face.</b> Nevertheless he smiled faintly as he bowed over Lucille's fingers.|$|R

60|$|Some days elapsed, and it {{appeared}} she was not likely to take much of a fancy to anybody in the house. She was not exactly naughty or wilful: she was far from disobedient; but an object less conducive to comfort--to tranquillity even--than she presented, it was scarcely possible to have before one's eyes. She moped: no grown person could have performed that uncheering business better; no <b>furrowed</b> <b>face</b> of adult exile, longing for Europe at Europe's antipodes, ever bore more legibly the signs of home sickness than did her infant visage. She seemed growing old and unearthly. I, Lucy Snowe, plead guiltless of that curse, an overheated and discursive imagination; but whenever, opening a room-door, I found her seated in a corner alone, {{her head in her}} pigmy hand, that room seemed to me not inhabited, but haunted.|$|R
60|$|He stood quite {{still for}} several moments with a hand clenched at his side and his <b>face</b> <b>furrowed,</b> and when he spoke again it was hoarsely.|$|R
5000|$|Monet {{painted a}} {{portrait}} of the chef Paul Antoine Graff wearing his white chef's hat and jacket. In {{the lower part of the}} painting, the figure fades into the light grey background, resulting in an oval shaped composition. Monsieur Paul has turned his head towards his right shoulder and looks into the direction of the left edge of the painting. His dark eyes do not focus on anything specific, and he appears to look just ahead of himself into the emptiness. His scrubby grey and black full beard is part of his appearance and nearly covers the protruding chin and the mouth with closed lips. The <b>furrowed</b> <b>face</b> was painted by Monet with strong strokes of his paintbrush, and the nose was emphasised by a more pronounced shade of the same colours. The art critic Melissa MacQuillan sees in his face his pride and the firmness of his character.|$|R
40|$|Incisive {{portrait}} of a balding deeply <b>furrowed</b> <b>face,</b> a self-{{portrait of}} the artist. Dated and initialed in ink and inscribed with a question mark. Born in Bruenn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czechoslovakia) in 1900, Norbert Troller served as a soldier in World War I, spending time as a prisoner-of-war in Italy. After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice. He died in 1984. digitizedDigital imag...|$|R
5000|$|Palaeoraphe {{has been}} placed in the Corypheae {{subtribe}} Livistoninae, which has twelve modern genera found in both the old world and the new world. [...] Of the three modern genera the Palaeoraphe flower is similar in character Brahea, Acoelorraphe and Colpothrinax, with the structure being closest in structure to that of Brahea. [...] Both genera having distinct sepals, petals with <b>furrows</b> <b>facing</b> the axis of the flower, and similarly shaped and sized anthers. [...] However the two genera can be told apart by the stigmas, which are united for their entire length in Brahea, and by the more relaxed positioning of the anthers in Palaeoraphe. [...] The flower of P. dominicana is a calyx of three broad sepals with irregular to fringed apices. [...] The three petals are joined at their bases and of the six stamins, those paired with petals are relxed into depressions on the petal surface, while the remaining three stamins are partially erect.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Haply,' he said, {{turning his}} <b>furrowed</b> <b>face</b> slowly about, {{that he might}} as it were {{individually}} address the whole audience, those both near and distant; 'haply, when this question has been tak'n up and discoosed, there'll {{be a threat to}} turn out if I'm let to work among yo. I hope I shall die ere ever such a time cooms, and I shall work solitary among yo unless it cooms - truly, I mun do 't, my friends; not to brave yo, but to live.

60|$|The <b>furrows</b> in his <b>face</b> deepened, {{the latent}} humor died {{out of his}} eyes. He turned to the summer-house window, and took up a pipe and tobacco pouch, left on the ledge.|$|R
6000|$|The {{mean and}} sordid aspect of Fowler Street {{emphasized}} {{and seemed to}} typify my despair, the pungent coal smoke stifled my lungs even as it stifled my spirit. Ugly factories, which {{were little more than}} sweatshops, wore an empty, menacing, [...] "Sunday" [...] look, and the faint November sunlight glistened on dirty pavements where children were making a semblance of play. Monotonous rows of red houses succeeded one another, some pushed forward, others thrust back behind little plots of stamped earth. Into one of these I turned. It seemed a little cleaner, better kept, less sordid than the others. I pulled the bell, and presently the door was opened by a woman whose arms were bare to the elbow. She wore a blue-checked calico apron that came to her throat, but the apron was clean, and her firm though <b>furrowed</b> <b>face</b> gave evidences of recent housewifely exertions. Her eyes had the strange look of the cheerfulness that is intimately acquainted with sorrow. She did not seem surprised at seeing me.|$|R
6000|$|It {{is evident}} that Maupassant looked upon his mankind in another spirit than those writers who make haste to {{submerge}} the difficulties of our holding-place in the universe under a flood of false and sentimental assumptions. Maupassant was a true and dutiful lover of our earth. He says himself {{in one of his}} descriptive passages: [...] "Nous autres que seduit la terre [...] ." [...] It was true. The earth had for him a compelling charm. He looks upon her august and <b>furrowed</b> <b>face</b> with the fierce insight of real passion. His is the power of detecting the one immutable quality that matters in the changing aspects of nature and under the ever-shifting surface of life. To say that he could not embrace in his glance all its magnificence and all its misery is only {{to say that he was}} human. He lays claim to nothing that his matchless vision has not made his own. This creative artist has the true imagination; he never condescends to invent anything; he sets up no empty pretences. And he stoops to no littleness in his art--least of all to the miserable vanity of a catching phrase.|$|R

50|$|The Belchen, {{with its}} <b>furrowed,</b> {{unbroken}} rock <b>faces,</b> rises 1,000 metres {{out of the}} Münstertal valley. Its north face is thus the area of highest relief energy in the German Central Uplands. Even towards the south the mountain drops steeply, its schrofen slopes descending 800 metres into the valley bowl of the Little Wiese near Neuenweg.|$|R
50|$|This bat is 2.75 to 3.75 in {{long and}} weighs less than 2 oz (same for male and female). The {{name of this}} species comes from the <b>furrow</b> down its <b>face.</b> The <b>furrow</b> is {{partially}} covered by its nose-leaf. It has a reddish brown to gray fur {{on the back and}} upper areas. The torso is pale grey.|$|R
50|$|PDP has {{a number}} of visible symptoms. Most {{important}} clinical features are: pachydermia (thickening and wrinkling of the skin), <b>furrowing</b> of the <b>face</b> and scalp, periostosis (swelling of periarticular tissue and shaggy periosteal new bone formation of long bones) and digital clubbing (enlargement of fingertips). Other features include excessive sweating, arthralgia and gastrointestinal abnormalities. An overview of all symptoms is provided in table 2.|$|R
60|$|If {{you would}} know {{the age of the}} earth, look upon the sea in a storm. The grayness of the whole immense surface, the wind <b>furrows</b> upon the <b>faces</b> of the waves, the great masses of foam, tossed about and waving, like matted white locks, give to the sea in a gale an {{appearance}} of hoary age, lustreless, dull, without gleams, {{as though it had been}} created before light itself.|$|R
60|$|The {{figure was}} slender and almost wizened, the thin {{shoulders}} round with an habitual stoop, the lean shanks were {{encased in a}} pair of much-darned, coarse black stockings. It was the figure of an old man, with a gentle, clear-cut <b>face</b> <b>furrowed</b> by a forest of wrinkles, and surmounted by scanty white locks above a smooth forehead which looked yellow and polished like an ancient piece of ivory.|$|R
6000|$|Amelia {{found him}} up very {{early the next}} morning, more eager, more hectic, and more shaky than ever. [...] "I didn't sleep much, Emmy, my dear," [...] he said. [...] "I was {{thinking}} of my poor Bessy. I wish she was alive, to ride in Jos's carriage once again. She kept her own and became it very well." [...] And his eyes filled with tears, which trickled down his <b>furrowed</b> old <b>face.</b> Amelia wiped them away, and smilingly kissed him, and tied the old man's neckcloth in a smart bow, and put his brooch into his best shirt frill, in which, in his Sunday suit of mourning, he sat from six {{o'clock in the morning}} awaiting the arrival of his son.|$|R
60|$|He {{rose and}} stood beneath the great carved mantelpiece. Over his head, hewn {{out of the}} solid oak, black with age and {{coloured}} with that deep richness which is to-day as a lost art, were blazoned the arms of one of Europe's noblest families. He, Nicholas of Reist, its sole male representative, stood deep in thought, his dark young <b>face</b> <b>furrowed</b> with anxiety. The moment was critical. It {{was one of a}} lifetime.|$|R
