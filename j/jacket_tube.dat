[...] Yellow Jackets are {{a type of}} adapter that allows the existing power tubes in a guitar amplifier to be replaced with EL84 power tubes without rebiasing the amplifier. In 1994, Guitar World Magazine conducted a test in which Yellow Jackets were installed in a 100-watt Marshall Plexi Reissue. The resulting tones were “similar to those of a Vox AC30” although the amplifier was not as loud {{as it had been}} before the modification. There are several sets of Yellow <b>Jacket</b> <b>tube</b> converters, their designations relate to the type of amplifier they are converting.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe ITER TF <b>jacket</b> <b>tube</b> {{is made of}} a {{modified}} 316 LN stainless steel and we demonstrate a detailed analysis after tensile tests at 300, 77 and 4. 2 K for the full size tubes. The tensile test results at 4. 2 K satisfy the ITER IO requirements. In contrast to fractured tubes after 300 and 77  K tests, the 4. 2 K tested tubes show obvious structural deformation. Two different kinds of fractured tubes for 4. 2 K tests are comparatively discussed regarding VSM, XRD and TEM data. The maximum phase deformation occurs at fracture and a gradual transformation of γ into α’ state occurs parallel the longitudinal direction...|$|E

A total of 420 rods and 10 thermocouple fuel rods containing plutonium- 1. 25 wt% aluminum fuel slugs were made. In addition, 120 blanket rods and 5 thermocouple A {{description is}} given of the developrnent and manufacture of Core IV for the Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I). A total of 420 rods and 10 thermocouple fuel rods containing plutonium- 1. 25 wt% aluminum fuel slugs were made. In addition, 120 blanket rods and 5 thermocouple rods were assembled with depleted uranium slugs. Both the fissile and fertile slugs were NaK bonded in Zircaloy- 2 jacket tubes. The fuel alloy was made by induction melting plutonium and aluminum. The centrifugal casting technique developed for EBR-I, Core-II was tried without success with this alloy. The gas pressure injection casting method developed for the EBR-II fuel cycle was used to cast the Core-IV rods. These were parted into rough slugs which were roll-sized and coined to final shape. After coining, the slugs were heat-treated and inspected. A loading technique was developed to protect {{the outside of the}} <b>jacket</b> <b>tube</b> and the weld zone from plutonium contamination. A connector fitting, with an integral tube for NaK filling, was welded {{to the top of the}} <b>jacket</b> <b>tube.</b> A measured quantity of NaK was injected through the fill opening by a hypodermic needle and syringe. The filling tube was then welded closed by the capacitor-discharge technique. The rods were then heat treated, leak detected, eddy-current bond inspected, x-rayed for NaK level, and gaged. All rods were surveyed for alpha contamination of the external surfaces and were shipped in approved birdcages to the reactor site. (auth...|$|E

Holey fibers have been made conventionally by stacking of capillaries. We have used a novel extrusion method to produce microstructured performs and we have successfully fabricated the first microstructured single-mode non-silica glass fiber. Good dimensional control and surface finished of preforms can be achieved through the optimization of the extrusion parameters such as temperature, pressure, shear strain rate and die design. Hence die swell and "melt fracture" are avoided. The microstructure holey fiber is fabricated by canning of the extruded microstructured perform.

30|$|The {{confinement}} {{provided by}} transverse reinforcement, external <b>jacket,</b> steel <b>tube</b> and UPVC tube is of a passive type. The confining pressure is developed {{only after the}} surrounding member undergoes hoop elongation (Poisson’s effect in concrete). The mechanics of confinement is therefore dependent mainly on two factors, one the tendency of concrete to dilate and second the radial stiffness of the confining member to restrain the dilation. Therefore, two conditions which are strain compatibility between the concrete core and the UPVC tube as well as equilibrium of forces in the free-body diagram for any sector of the confined section must always be satisfied.|$|R

50|$|The Mark 4, {{also known}} as the M1895 gun, was of an entirely new design {{intended}} to arm auxiliaries. It consisted of a <b>tube,</b> <b>jacket,</b> hoop, locking hoop, and faceplate with the Mod 1 being a Mod 0 but with a conical nickel-steel liner. The Mark 5 was almost the same as the Mark 4 just without the faceplate, with the Mod 1 also being a Mod 0 with a conical nickel-steel liner.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 10, gun No. 365-A, was {{order in}} 1915 {{but does not}} appear to have been {{completed}} until after WW I. The initial drawings were for a 4-inch/50 caliber anti-aircraft gun dated January and February 1915. It was designed with a vertically sliding breech block on a built-up gun with a <b>tube,</b> <b>jacket,</b> chase hoop and locking ring, all constructed of nickel steel, but it does not appear that the Mark 10 was put into service.|$|R
50|$|The {{built-up}} gun {{is constructed}} of liner, <b>tube,</b> <b>jacket,</b> three hoops, two locking rings, tube and liner locking ring, yoke ring and screw box liner. Some components were autofretted. Typical of United States naval weapons {{built in the}} 1940s, the bore was chromium-plated for longer barrel life. It uses a Welin breech block that opens downwards and is hydraulically operated. The screw box liner and breech plug are segmented with stepped screw threads arranged in fifteen sectors of 24 degrees each.|$|R
50|$|The first Mark 4, gun No. 133, was {{completed}} July 1896. Production numbers were Nos. 133-196, 260-263, and 423-426.

It was originally threaded to be mounted in the Mark 5 gun mount. Mod 0 was very similar to the Mark 3 Mod 2 but with the breech ring lengthened , the trunnion hoop removed and the barrel threaded.|$|R
5000|$|The Navy's Policy Board {{call for}} a variety of large caliber weapons in 1890, with ranges {{all the way up to}} 16 in, led to the {{development}} of the 12 in/35 caliber gun. The Mark 1, gun Nos. 1-8, was constructed of gun steel, having a <b>tube,</b> <b>jacket,</b> ten hoops and a locking ring. The Mod 0, the original design, had the inner hoop starting [...] from the breech and running out to the muzzle, with the Mod 1 being hooped from breech to muzzle.|$|R
50|$|Mark 1, Nos. 1 and 2, were 31 calibers {{and two of}} {{the first}} steel tube guns that were built entirely in the United States. They were trunnioned guns, no liners and that fired bag ammunition. After the Spanish-American War was over they were {{modified}} to Mod 1 in 1901. A liner was inserted in the breech end and the trunnions were cut off. The Mod 1 consisted of <b>tube,</b> <b>jacket,</b> and 9 hoops. After these changes the gun was able to use the same ammunition as the later Mark 2 5-inch gun.|$|R
2500|$|The Mark 3 was {{the last}} 10-inch gun built for the U.S. Navy, with a <b>tube,</b> <b>jacket,</b> locking ring and screw box liner {{manufactured}} from nickel steel.

They also had a flatter trajectory, which led to more accurate firing and aided in centralized fire control. In 1908, the armor-piercing shells were fitted with a ballistic cap lengthened to 7crh. This improved their penetration ability at longer ranges.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 1, gun No. 1, was {{constructed}} of <b>tube,</b> <b>jacket,</b> 16 hoops, an elevating band and intefral trunnions with a screwed on muzzle bell. The Mark 2 also trunnioned with the Mark 2 Mod 1 only having 10 hoops, jacket, and chamber liner and the Mod 2 the same {{but with a}} full length liner. All Mark 1 and Mark 2 guns were constructed to a length of 30 calibers. In 1895 all Mark 2s were ordered to be converted to rapid-fire, fixed ammunition. This was done in 1898-1902 with gun No. 2 being delivered in November 1898 for use in Atlanta.|$|R
