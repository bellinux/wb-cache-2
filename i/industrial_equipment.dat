5|$|The {{implementation}} of the immense task of reconstructing the country was accompanied by the struggle {{of the new government}} to acquire centralized authority, further complicated by the mistrust a considerable part of society held for the new regime and by disputes over Poland's postwar borders, which were not firmly established until mid-1945. In 1947 Soviet pressure caused the Polish government to reject the American-sponsored Marshall Plan, and to join the Soviet Union-dominated Comecon in 1949. The Soviet forces present engaged in plunder of the former eastern territories of Germany which were being transferred to Poland, stripping it of valuable <b>industrial</b> <b>equipment,</b> infrastructure and factories and sending them to the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|The diving {{environment}} {{is limited by}} accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving {{is done in the}} shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled <b>industrial</b> <b>equipment.</b> The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team.|$|E

Therefore, {{it has been a}} great challenge for practicing engineers to ensure temporal correctness and reliability of interaction behaviors among <b>industrial</b> <b>equipments.</b> Nowadays, pi-calculus, a process algebra and NuSMV, a symbolic model checker, have been widely applied to address this posed challenge respectively. However, they are always used separately. Because different formal methods focus on different aspects of systems, only one single method is still difficult to cope very well with the posed challenge. Therefore in this paper, an integrated framework of formal methods, which combines it-calculus with NuSMV, is constructed. pi-Calculus can definitely specify equipment interaction, and NuSMV can automate verification process. Especially counterexamples fed back by NuSMV can help practicing engineers to trace temporal violations. Furthermore, a cooperative traffic lights control strategy is illuminated to show how the framework works. (c) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
