5000|$|A <b>hybrid</b> <b>coil</b> (or bridge transformer, or {{sometimes}} hybrid) is a transformer that has three windings, {{and which is}} designed to be configured as a circuit having four ports that are conjugate in pairs.|$|E

50|$|A {{bridge tap}} has no <b>hybrid</b> <b>coil</b> or other {{impedance}} matching components, just a “T” (or branch) in the cable. Thus the bridge presents an impedance mismatch. The unused {{branch of the}} T is usually left with no device connected to its end, thus has no electrical termination. Both the tap and its unterminated branch cause unwanted signal reflections, also called echoes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fundamental}} principle {{is that of}} impedance matching. The incoming signal is applied to both the telephone line and a [...] "balancing network" [...] {{that is designed to}} have the same impedance as the line. The outgoing signal is derived by subtracting the two, thus canceling the incoming signal from the outgoing signal. Early hybrids were made with transformers configured as <b>hybrid</b> <b>coils</b> that had an extra winding that could be connected out of phase. The name hybrid comes from these special mixed-winding transformers.|$|R
5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of electronic amplifiers, mechanically coupled carbon microphones were used as amplifiers in telephone repeaters. After {{the turn of the}} century it was found that negative resistance mercury lamps could amplify, and they were used. [...] The invention of audion tube repeaters around 1916 made transcontinental telephony practical. In the 1930s vacuum tube repeaters using <b>hybrid</b> <b>coils</b> became commonplace, allowing the use of thinner wires. In the 1950s negative impedance gain devices were more popular, and a transistorized version called the E6 repeater was the final major type used in the Bell System before the low cost of digital transmission made all voiceband repeaters obsolete. Frequency frogging repeaters were commonplace in frequency-division multiplexing systems from the middle to late 20th century...|$|R
50|$|In {{a hybrid}} set, <b>hybrid</b> <b>coil,</b> or {{resistance}} hybrid, balancing network is a circuit used to match, i.e., to balance, {{the impedance of}} a uniform transmission line, (e.g., a twisted metallic pair, coaxial cable, etc.) over a selected range of frequencies. A balancing network is required to ensure isolation between the two ports of the four-wire side of the hybrid.|$|E
50|$|A {{full-duplex}} (FDX) system, {{or sometimes}} called double-duplex, allows communication in both directions, and, unlike half-duplex, allows {{this to happen}} simultaneously. Land-line telephone networks are full-duplex, since they allow both callers to speak and be heard at the same time, with the transition from four to two wires being achieved by a <b>hybrid</b> <b>coil</b> in a telephone hybrid. Modern cell phones are also full-duplex.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{microphone}} and speaker, additional circuitry is incorporated to prevent the incoming speaker signal and the outgoing microphone signal from interfering with each other. This is accomplished through a <b>hybrid</b> <b>coil</b> (A3). The incoming audio signal passes through a resistor (A8) and the primary winding of the coil (A3) which passes it to the speaker (A1). Since the current path A8 - A3 has a far lower impedance than the microphone (A2), {{virtually all of the}} incoming signal passes through it and bypasses the microphone.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary use}} of a {{voiceband}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>coil</b> is to convert between 2-wire and 4-wire operation in sequential sections of a communications circuit, for example in a four-wire terminating set. Such conversion was necessary when repeaters were introduced in a 2-wire circuit, a frequent practice at early 20th century telephony. Without hybrids, the output of one amplifier feeds directly into the input of the other, resulting in a howling situation (upper diagram). By using hybrids, the outputs and inputs are isolated, resulting in correct 2-wire repeater operation. Late in the century, this practice became rare but hybrids continued in use in line cards.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, a {{two-wire}} circuit {{is characterized by}} supporting transmission in two directions simultaneously, as opposed to four-wire circuits, which have separate pairs for transmit and receive. In either case they are twisted pairs. Telephone lines are almost all two wire, while trunks and switching are almost entirely four wire. To communicate in both directions in the same wire pair, conversion between four-wire and two-wire is necessary, both at the telephone and at the central office. A <b>hybrid</b> <b>coil</b> accomplishes the conversion for both. At the central office, {{it is part of}} a four-wire terminating set, more often as part of a line card.|$|E
50|$|A major {{expense of}} {{wire-line}} telephone service is the outside wire plant. Telephones transmit both the incoming and outgoing speech signals on {{a single pair of}} wires. A twisted pair line rejects electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk better than a single wire or an untwisted pair. The strong outgoing speech signal from the microphone (transmitter) does not overpower the weaker incoming speaker (receiver) signal with sidetone because a <b>hybrid</b> <b>coil</b> (A3) and other components compensate the imbalance. The junction box (B) arrests lightning (B2) and adjusts the line's resistance (B1) to maximize the signal power for the line length. Telephones have similar adjustments for inside line lengths (A8). The line voltages are negative compared to earth, to reduce galvanic corrosion. Negative voltage attracts positive metal ions toward the wires.|$|E
40|$|Goal: This study aims at a {{systematic}} assessment of five computational models of a birdcage coil for {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) with respect to accuracy and computational cost. Methods: The models were implemented using the same geometrical model and numerical algorithm, but different driving methods (i. e., coil “defeaturing”). The defeatured models were labeled as: specific (S 2), generic (G 32, G 16), and hybrid (H 16, H 16 fr-forced). The accuracy of the models was evaluated using the “symmetric mean absolute percentage error” (“SMAPE”), by comparison with measurements in terms of frequency response, as well as electric (||E⃗||) and magnetic (||B⃗||) field magnitude. Results: All the models computed the ||B⃗|| within 35 % of the measurements, only the S 2, G 32, and H 16 were able to accurately model the ||E⃗|| inside the phantom with a maximum SMAPE of 16 %. Outside the phantom, only the S 2 showed a SMAPE lower than 11 %. Conclusions: Results showed that assessing the accuracy of ||B⃗|| based only on comparison along the central longitudinal line of the coil can be misleading. Generic or <b>hybrid</b> <b>coils</b> - when properly modeling the currents along the rings/rungs - were sufficient to accurately reproduce the fields inside a phantom while a specific model was needed to accurately model ||E⃗|| {{in the space between}} coil and phantom. Significance: Computational modeling of birdcage body coils is extensively used in the evaluation of radiofrequency-induced heating during MRI. Experimental validation of numerical models is needed to determine if a model is an accurate representation of a physical coil...|$|R

50|$|Sidetone in 19th century {{telephones}} varied {{until the}} carbon transmitter was used, which produced a distinct sidetone that discouraged speaking loudly enough, and occasionally so loud as {{to cause the}} instrument to produce uncontrolled oscillations, resulting in howling audio effects. Sidetone is disabled when phones of any kind are running in speakerphone mode, due to perpetual and almost immediate feedback. Anti-sidetone circuitry incorporating {{the principle of the}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>coil</b> brought sidetone under control in the early 20th century, leaving enough feedback signal to assure the user that the phone is really working, and allowing the use of a unitized telephone handset. In cellular technologies, one of the many benefits of sidetone-enabled phones is that a user knows a call has been dropped or ended if he or she no longer hears sidetone.|$|E
50|$|Telephone systems {{also use}} matched {{impedances}} to minimise echo on long-distance lines. This {{is related to}} transmission-line theory. Matching also enables the telephone <b>hybrid</b> <b>coil</b> (2- to 4-wire conversion) to operate correctly. As the signals are sent and received on the same two-wire circuit to the central office (or exchange), cancellation is necessary at the telephone earpiece so excessive sidetone is not heard. All devices used in telephone signal paths are generally dependent on matched cable, source and load impedances. In the local loop, the impedance chosen is 600 ohms (nominal). Terminating networks are installed at the exchange to offer the best match to their subscriber lines. Each country has its own standard for these networks, but they are all designed to approximate about 600 ohms over the voice frequency band.|$|E
5000|$|Telephone hybrids {{are used}} in {{telephone}} exchanges to convert the 4-wire appearance to the 2-wire last mile connection to the subscriber's telephone. A different kind of hybrid is used in telephone handsets to convert the four wires of the transmitter (earpiece) and receiver (microphhone) to the 2-wire line connection. This kind of hybrid is more commonly called an induction coil due to its derivation from high-voltage induction coils. It does not produce a high voltage, but like the high-voltage variety, it is a step-up transformer in order to impedance match the low-impedance carbon button transmitter to the higher impedance parts of the system. The simple induction coil later evolved into a form of hybrid as a sidetone reduction measure, or volume of microphone output that was fed back to the earpiece. Without this, the phone user's own voice would be louder in the earpiece than the other party's. [...] Today, the transformer version of the hybrid {{has been replaced by}} resistor networks and compact IC versions, which use integrated circuit electronics to do the job of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|E

40|$|Josephson {{parametric}} converters (JPCs) are superconducting devices {{capable of}} performing nondegenerate, three-wave mixing {{in the microwave}} domain without losses. One drawback limiting their use in scalable quantum architectures is the large footprint of the auxiliary circuit needed for their operation, in particular, the use of off-chip, bulky, broadband <b>hybrids</b> and magnetic <b>coils.</b> Here, we realize a JPC which {{eliminates the need for}} these bulky components. The pump drive and flux bias are applied in the new device through an on-chip, lossless, three-port power divider and on-chip flux line, respectively. We show that the new design considerably simplifies the circuit and reduces the footprint of the device while maintaining a comparable performance to state-of-the-art JPCs. Furthermore, we exploit the tunable bandwidth property of the JPC and the added capability of applying alternating currents to the flux line in order to switch the resonance frequencies of the device, hence demonstrating time-multiplexed amplification of microwave tones that are separated by more than the dynamical bandwidth of the amplifier. Such a measurement technique can potentially serve to perform time-multiplexed, high-fidelity readout of superconducting qubits...|$|R

Now incorporated into many locomotive robot designs, such compliance control can enable disturbance rejection and improved transition between changing ground conditions.

40|$|The {{radiofrequency}} field homogeneity {{and quality}} factor (Q) {{of a number}} of high-pass resonator designs are compared theoretically and experimentally for small-bore coils. It was found that for high-pass resonators with the number of distributed capacitors greater than eight, a significant and unacceptable decrease in Q resulted. A number of schemes are proposed and investigated to improve the homogeneity of eight-capacitor high-pass resonators, thus balancing Q and homogeneity. These designs include variation in rung width, interrung feeding, a new <b>hybrid</b> <b>coil</b> design, and the use of internal guard rings. Eleven high-pass resonators were modeled and built to test the designs. The current density in each conductor was calculated using a novel numerical technique based on the inverse finite Hilbert transform which implicitly includes the effects of RF eddy currents.
