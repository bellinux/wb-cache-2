40|$|Abstract: Furnaces {{are most}} {{commonly}} used for melting of materials. <b>Induction</b> <b>furnaces</b> are more beneficial as no fuel is required. It is a problem to find life of <b>Induction</b> Melting <b>Furnace</b> wall under thermal fatigue. The <b>induction</b> melting <b>furnace</b> wall is made of alumina ramming mass which is one kind of refractory material. The failure occurs due to cyclic thermal stresses. Temperature distribution and thermal stress distribution fields of the <b>induction</b> melting <b>furnace</b> refractory wall were calculated by using ANSYS finite element analysis software based on the physical description of its failure under thermal fatigue conditions. The thermal fatigue life of the refractory wall is required to be found out by means of thermal stresses created inside the refractory wall of <b>induction</b> melting <b>furnace</b> from modified S – log N Curve...|$|R
50|$|Several {{specialised}} furnaces {{are used}} to heat the metal. Furnaces are refractory-lined vessels that contain the material to be melted and provide the energy to melt it. Modern furnace types include electric arc <b>furnaces</b> (EAF), <b>induction</b> <b>furnaces,</b> cupolas, reverberatory, and crucible furnaces. Furnace choice {{is dependent on the}} alloy system quantities produced. For ferrous materials EAFs, cupolas, and <b>induction</b> <b>furnaces</b> are commonly used. Reverberatory and crucible furnaces are common for producing aluminium, bronze, and brass castings.|$|R

The use of gas cupola’s duplex process – <b>induction</b> crucible <b>furnace</b> – has been proved the effective direction of scientific and technical advance in the foundry industry. Gas cupolas and <b>induction</b> <b>furnaces</b> are used for cast iron smelting at the Penza Compressor Plant where in the 1960 s the author developed and introduced gas cupolas {{for the first time}} in the world. In the article, the author represents the findings of the investigation on thermodynamics of crucible reduction of silicon, which is pivotal when choosing the technological mode for cast iron smelting in <b>induction</b> <b>furnaces.</b> The author proposes a new reaction crucible diagram with due account of both partial pressure and activity of the components involved into the process. For the first time ever, the electrochemical mechanism of a crucible reaction has been studied and the correctness of the proposed diagram has been confirmed...|$|R

5000|$|Rowan {{originally}} {{worked for}} Ajax Electrothermic Corporation of Trenton, New Jersey. He suggested {{improvements to the}} furnaces made by Ajax - shorter power leads and heavier copper bus bar - but the company did not implement his suggestions. Rowan left Ajax and decided {{to start his own}} company, Inductotherm Corp. Mr. Rowan designed and built his first <b>induction</b> <b>furnace</b> in his home's garage in 1953 {{with the help of his}} wife. Expanding from this first <b>induction</b> <b>furnace</b> Rowan created Inductotherm Industries Inc. which has since grown to include 80 subsidiaries throughout North America, South America, Europe, India, Asia and Australia. Today, there are more than 27,000 Inductotherm induction melting installations worldwide and they account for more than half of the melting systems in the world today.|$|E
50|$|The smelter {{includes}} an <b>induction</b> <b>furnace</b> for {{the manufacture of}} ingots and metal ferrules. The metals are melted in the furnace at 1600 °C.

50|$|Vacuum {{induction}} melting uses currents {{within a}} vacuum to melt metal. VIM involves placing a core-less <b>induction</b> <b>furnace</b> into a vacuum chamber. The heat used {{to start the}} melting process comes from an induced current called an eddy current.

5000|$|The {{advantage}} of the <b>induction</b> <b>furnace</b> is a clean, energy-efficient and well-controllable melting process compared to most other means of metal melting. Most modern foundries use this type of furnace, and now also more iron foundries are replacing cupolas with induction furnaces to melt cast iron, as the former emit lots of dust and other pollutants.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach is the}} tilt-pour furnace whereby an <b>induction</b> <b>furnace</b> is tilted to pour the melt into a conical tundish that in turn delivers the molten metal to the melt delivery nozzle.

50|$|Early {{last century}} the {{principles}} were explored {{as a means}} to melt steel, and the motor generator was developed to provide the power required for the <b>induction</b> <b>furnace.</b> After general acceptance of the methodology for melting steel, engineers began to explore other possibilities for the utilisation of the process. It was already understood that the depth of current penetration in steel was a function of its magnetic permeability, resistivity and the frequency of the applied field.

5000|$|Until recently, {{pig iron}} was {{typically}} poured {{directly out of}} {{the bottom of the}} blast furnace through a [...] into a ladle car for transfer to the steel mill in mostly liquid form; in this state, the pig iron was referred to as hot metal.
