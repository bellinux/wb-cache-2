40|$|In {{the mining}} of perlite deposits, {{controlling}} {{the generation of}} fine particles and the concentration of metals is of outstanding importance to meet the environmental and market requirements. Particle size and chemical purity are conventionally manipulated during the processing of the ore to achieve high product specifications. However, the current practices do not consider a proactive approach that focuses in the <b>in-pit</b> characterisation of the ore that would minimise the environmental impact and optimise the mining process since its early stages. This paper presents a method for the <b>in-pit</b> detection of the perlite ore variability that {{is related to the}} generation of fine particles and the elevated concentration of metals. Particle size and chemical purity showed to be dependent on the mineralogical variations of the ore, specifically opal and montmorillonite.

Such index provided insight into the correlation between mineralogy, fine particles and concentration of metals. Consequently, the index could be used not only for mineralogical determination but also as a predictor of the presence of the main impurities in the perlite ore. These results can be implemented in perlite mining to reduce the generation of waste and can influence the production of high-quality perlite products. Resource Engineerin...|$|E

Today´s predominant means of material transport in hard-rock surface mines are conventional mining trucks however despite rationalisation efforts material transportation cost increased significantly {{over the last}} decades and currently reach up to 60 % of overall mining. Thus, considerations and efforts to reduce overall mining costs, promise highest success when focusing {{on the development of}} more economic material transport methods. Semi-mobile <b>in-pit</b> crusher and conveyor (SMIPCC) systems represent a viable, safer and less fossil fuel dependent alternative however its viability is still highly argued as inadequate methods for the long term projection of system capacity leads to high uncertainty and consequently higher risk. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to develop a structured method for the determination of <b>In-pit</b> crusher and conveyor SMIPCC system that incorporates the random behaviour of system elements and their interaction. The method is based on a structured time usage model specific to SMIPCC system supported by a stochastic simulation. The developed method is used in a case study based on a hypothetical mine environment to analyse the system behaviour with regards to time usage model component, system capacity, and cost as a function of truck quantity and stockpile capacity. Furthermore, a comparison between a conventional truck & shovel system and SMIPCC system is provided. Results show that the capacity of a SMIPCC system reaches an optimum in terms of cost per tonne, which is 24 % (22 cents per tonne) lower than a truck and shovel system. In addition, the developed method is found to be effective in providing a significantly higher level of information, which can be used in the mining industry to accurately project the economic viability of implementing a SMIPCC system...|$|E

The Nchanga Open Pit NOP mine started in 1955 situated {{to the west}} of NUG and partially overlying it. Open pit water control safety operations in the Nchanga-Chingola area have successfully enabled the safe extraction of millions of tonnes of copper ore annually over the past 60 years from NUG mining as well as the NOP. At the start Nchanga mining license surface already had NUG and many watershed divides with the Nchanga and Chingola streams being the main streams feeding into Zambias second largest river Kafue river and 42 of the year was characterised by heavy rains ranging between 800 mm to 1300 mm per annum. In this paper the presence of very significant amounts of seasonal rain and subsurface water in the mining area was identified as both a curse and a blessing. An excess in seasonal rain and subsurface water would disrupt both open pit and underground mining operations. In order for NOP to be operated successfully stable and free from flooding coping water management tactics were adopted from 1955 to 2015 including 1. Underground mine pump chamber pumping system 2.

40|$|In coal mining, {{spontaneous}} combustion {{can occur in}} many areas such as stockpiles, underground workings, waste dumps, coal faces, <b>in-pit</b> ramps and backfill areas. Spontaneous combustion {{has been defined as}} an oxidation reaction, which occurs without an external heat source.

These fires pose a serious risk to the safety of workers in the coal mines. This phenomenon also has an environmental impact, which can affect {{the quality of life for}} future generations. Extensive research work has been done and recorded about spontaneous combustion in coal stockpiles, dumps and coal faces, but very limited work has been conducted on raw coal storage bunkers. This study investigated the occurrence of spontaneous combustion in coal storage bunkers, and established that there is no single document available that addresses the problem adequately. Therefore, a need was identified to create a guideline with decision analyser steps to be able to arrive quickly at a possible solution to the problem. This work does not address spontaneous combustion in underground workings, waste dumps, stockpiles, coal faces, <b>in-pit</b> ramps and backfill areas. It was found that important factors affecting the possibility of SC occurring were the type of coal being supplied to the bunker, the mining practice with regard to the standing time of the loose cubic metres of coal on the mining benches, and the impact of the physical factors around the bunker. The information obtained could be of great significance when designing or trying to solve spontaneous combustion problems in raw coal storage bunkers. The guideline and decision analyser steps can be applied early in the phase of the project in order to minimise or eliminate similar mistakes made in the industry over the years.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} impact of various haulage systems on the desired {{production}} objectives, energy costs, and fuel emissions. The transportation of ore and waste to the dumps could be either done by conventional trucks or by a truck trolley system. The economic analysis for stage S 3 shows that the truck trolley system can increase the CPV by 9. 0 % from - 173. 9 M€ to - 158. 2 M€. In stage N 7 the CPV can be increased with 14. 8 % from - 332. 0 M€ to - 282. 9 M€. The sensitivity analysis shows that the results are mostly dependent on the diesel price, followed by the capital expenditures, maintenance costs, and the electricity price. The dependency {{of the availability of}} the trolley trucks is non-linear, but it is not likely that the availability will be lower than the current case. The transportation of ore from crusher K 315 should be done by a conveying system. Although the designs are not optimal yet, a big difference can be seen between conveying systems and a truck trolley system. The truck trolley system {{is by far the most}} expensive with a CPV of - 186. 8 M€, while the CPV for a conveyor tunnel is - 74. 8 M€ and the CPV of an <b>in-pit</b> conveyor is even better with - 67. 8 M€. The results are most dependent on the maintenance costs, followed by the capital costs, availability of the system, and the electricity price. The truck trolley system allows a CO 2 reduction of 28 % in stage S 3, and 36 % in stage N 7. A total of 1. 59 Mt of CO 2 can be saved. These results are really promising, especially because of the world’s need to reduce CO 2 emissions. The costs can be significantly reduced by using a truck trolley system for the transportation of ore and waste to the dumps.

40|$|The Athabasca Basin in {{northern}} Saskatchewan, Canada {{is a major}} source of uranium (U) and an important economic driver for the province and country. The Athabasca Basin U deposits contain elevated concentrations of As, Se, Mo, Ni, and 226 Ra (elements of concern; EOCs). The Key Lake U mill uses a stepwise Ca(OH) 2 neutralization process (pH 4. 0, 6. 5, 9. 5, and 10. 5) to precipitate EOCs from raffinate (acidic, metal-rich wastewater) prior to releasing the effluent to the environment. The neutralization process precipitates a complex mixture of secondary minerals concentrated with EOCs that are deposited to an <b>in-pit</b> tailings management facility (TMF) at pH ≈ 10. 1. Extensive studies show adsorption to ferrihydrite is a primary control on aqueous EOC concentrations. Recent studies suggest poorly characterized Al and Mg precipitates could also influence EOC concentrations. The objectives of this thesis were to characterize the Al and Mg secondary mineralogy in the Key Lake neutralization process and quantify controls exerted by these minerals on EOC concentrations. Additionally, a review of all geochemical literature pertaining to <b>in-pit</b> TMFs in the Athabasca Basin was conducted to synthesize the collective science. Laboratory and mill samples were used for the study. The Al and Mg secondary minerals identified were amorphous AlOHSO 4 (a hydrobasaluminite-like phase, existing below neutral pH), amorphous Al(OH) 3, MgAl-hydrotalcite, and Al-substituted ferrihydrite. In the absence of ferrihydrite, Al and Mg mineral phases sequestered As, Se, Mo, and Ni. Batch adsorption experiments showed MgAl-hydrotalcite adsorbs As, Se, and Mo to the same order of magnitude as ferrihydrite. Arsenic and Ni XAS experiments showed Al and Mg minerals sequester As and Ni in concert with ferrihydrite. Arsenic(V) formed bidentate-binuclear complexes on the surface of ferrihydrite and amorphous Al(OH) 3. Hydrotalcite adsorbed As(V) on the mineral surface and/or within the mineral interlayer through bidentate complexation. Nickel was adsorbed to amorphous Al(OH) 3 through edge-sharing bidentate-mononuclear complexes and precipitated as a Ni-Al layered double hydroxide at pH 10. 5.

40|$|A {{strategic}} mine planning model {{determines the}} best order of extraction and destination of material over the mine-life, {{in a way}} that maximizes the net present value of the produced minerals. In case of oil sands open-pit mining, further processing of the extracted oil sands generates massive volumes of slurry containing water, sands, clay and fine material known as tailings. Since the tailings volume significantly influences the mine production and site reclamation, it is reasonable to consider tailings management within the frameworks of long-term mine planning. One of the current practices in Alberta oil sands industry is to process the tailings slurry and make composite tailings (CT), through adding coagulant aids to the mature fine tailings (MFT), to accelerate its dewatering and make it ready for reclamation. To save space and also to avoid higher reclamation costs, the processed tailings is deposited in <b>in-pit</b> tailings containments constructed by internal dykes using mine waste material. In this research, an integrated mine planning framework is proposed, implemented and verified using mixed-integer linear programming technique, to optimize the production schedule with respect to min...|$|E
