40|$|As a {{guide in}} the design of mini-arrays used to exploit the Linsley effect in the study of air showers, it is useful to {{calculate}} the expected rates. The results can aid in the choice of detectors and their placement or in predicting the utility of existing detector systems. Furthermore, the potential of the method can be appraised for the study of large showers. Specifically, we treat the case of a mini-array of dimensions small enough compared to the <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>axes</b> of showers of interest {{so that it can be}} considered a point detector. The input information is taken from the many previous studies of air showers by other groups. The calculations will give: (1) the expected integral rate, F(sigma, rho), for disk thickness, sigma, or rise time, t sub 1 / 2, with local particle density, rho, as a parameter; (2) the effective detection area A(N) with sigma (min) and rho (min) and rho (min) as parameters; (3) the expected rate of collection of data F sub L (N) versus shower size, N...|$|E

For each user, the iris code of different samples is calculated, and by comparing these iris codes, the probability of changing each bit is determined.

40|$|Directional Drilling (DD) {{technology}} {{can be used in}} deep glacier boreholes to obtain additional ice cores from any depth and create supplemental boreholes for geophysical research on glacier ice properties under natural conditions. Experimental directional drilling was done using an antifreeze thermal electrical drill (ATED) in a PICO test well. A special device called a whipstock was used for the deflection of the ATED in previously-drilled borehole. The test demonstrated that a whipstock deployed in the main borehole permits directional drilling to obtain extra ice core. The experimental whipstock was placed 25 cm above the bottom of the 4. 5 m deep borehole. The ATED was inclined in previously-prepared cavity to an angle of up to 3 °. When the second borehole reached a depth of about 6 m from the whipstock it had no inclination. The <b>distance</b> between <b>axes</b> <b>of</b> the main and secondary boreholes was about 0. 3 m.

40|$|There is {{historical}} {{evidence for the}} belief among Aboriginal communities of pre-colonial south-eastern Australia that the sky was in imminent danger of collapsing, and all of humanity perishing in an epic flood, unless stone axes were bestowed upon a powerful deity that dwelt in the Australian Alps. Previously, I have argued that this ‘falling sky’ story provides insight into the elaborate symbolism associated with stone axes in Aboriginal societies of the southeast, particularly with regards to cosmological dimensions <b>of</b> the vast <b>axe</b> trading network centred on the renowned Mount William quarry. Recently, however, Peter Hiscock (2013) has proposed that this entire incident is more parsimoniously interpreted {{as a response to}} the disruptions created by British colonisation, and hence, this notion of an impending apocalypse has no bearing on our understanding <b>of</b> the long <b>distance</b> exchange <b>of</b> stone <b>axes</b> in the pre-contact history of this region. Here, I provide a more detailed analysis of the falling sky story and its wider context in historically known Aboriginal societies of the southeast. I reject the argument proposed by Hiscock (2013) that the beliefs underpinning it contain Christian motifs. Aboriginal oral traditions from throughout the southeast refer to deity-induced floods that destroyed an ‘antediluvian’ world of humans and marked the beginning of a new cultural epoch. While these flood myths superficially resemble biblical notions of a world-ending deluge, I argue that they are probably oral histories of post-glacial sea-level rises, and thus, distinctly ancient. The falling sky story, I conclude, offers hints at the extent to which religious knowledge and symbolic belief were integrated with economic dimensions <b>of</b> the stone <b>axe</b> exchange system in south-eastern Australia.
