40|$|The building’s energy {{performance}} {{is the result}} not only of material and component performances, {{but also of the}} way the components are interconnected. Concerning windows, their {{energy performance}}, which is usually evaluated by using the glass and frame heat transfer coefficients and the linear heat transfer coefficients of the glazing spacer, depends also on the <b>frame</b> <b>installation.</b> In this paper the entity of thermal losses due to the <b>frame</b> <b>installation</b> has been evaluated in terms of linear thermal transmittance calculated in accordance with the standard EN ISO 10211 : 2007 using THERM 5. 2. The analysis of thermal bridges between a wooden frame window installed into two different kinds of external clay block walls has been carried out. The linear thermal transmittances have been calculated for three cases regarding the position (external, internal, and intermediate) and three concerning the insulation of the hole perimeter (non insulated, insulated and with insulation over fixed frame). The impact of the window installation on thermal losses has been estimated and its dependence on different sizes has been evaluated. A new graphical representation has been suggested. The frame position and the configuration of the window hole insulation result to have a relevant impact on the overall thermal performance of the considered window...|$|E

This setup includes control of the entire apparatus from the rotating <b>frame,</b> <b>installation</b> of a new EMCCD camera that allows for imaging of nanoscale tracer particles, and {{the development and implementation}} of a new isolation cell, which permits investigation into new phenomena such as differential rotation in helium-II. We have observed the vortex lattice dynamics in the (r, &phi) plane (i. e. transverse to the vortices) and present here the first real-time visualization of Tkachenko waves in helium-II from this cross section. Additionally, we present evidence of differential rotation with distinct Stewartson layer boundaries, possible Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, and the formation and propagation of superfluid collective vortex eddies. We show that the angular velocity is a function of radius and may be driven by the geometry of the isolation cell. We also document the observation and analysis of gravity-capillary surface waves that demonstrate an interaction between the liquid helium free surface and the bulk of the fluid...|$|E
40|$|For {{each new}} project, supply chain {{participants}} (SCPs) {{must decide whether}} to adopt a ‘tried and true ’ past work structure or an alternative that involves designing and building perhaps using an unfamiliar approach. Significant risks but also rewards {{may be associated with}} using different work structures. Conservative SCPs therefore favor work structures that involve no change or only incremental change, as opposed to radical change. Often, a project’s tight budget and schedule induce SCPs to use only the ‘tried and true ’ because the corresponding processes and outcomes are predictable. In addition, directions given to SCPs instruct them to design and build projects in a certain way, so it is difficult to consider building projects any differently, especially if the current method works. If one SCP sees an opportunity for improvement with an alternative work structure, others remain to be convinced that it is an opportunity before they will help obtain approvals and manage implementation. This paper describes such a case. It presents ways to characterize and compare work structure alternatives. SCPs might use similar comparisons to guide their selection of work structures on future projects.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a solar photovoltaic silicon panel is inversely proportional to its operating temperature. Therefore the overheating risk must be avoided {{in order to improve}} the cells electric efficiency. The temperature increase in a solar cell also gives rise to thermal stresses within the module. In this work the authors propose an experimental and numerical investigation of photovoltaic collectors temperature and efficiency dependence on main design parameters (thickness of the aluminum <b>frame),</b> <b>installation</b> technique (distance between photovoltaic panel and supporting panel, tilt angle of the module), and environmental operating conditions, with particular reference to the wind velocity. Experimental investigations have been conducted on a two photovoltaic modules assembly composed by silicon panels. Numerical simulations have been performed employing a two-dimensional finite element numerical model, validated against experiments carried out by the authors. The validated numerical tool has been applied to evaluate photovoltaic collector performance dependence on panel geometrical parameters, installation procedure and operating conditions. The main objective of the present paper is to provide installation and operating indications in order to maximize efficiency. From the conducted investigations it has been evidenced that an optimal distance of the panel from the support can be found, corresponding to which the efficiency is maximized...|$|E
40|$|Work {{structuring}} means {{developing a}} project's process design {{while trying to}} align engineering design, supply chain, resource allocation, and assembly efforts. The goal of work structuring is to make work flow more reliable and quick while delivering value to the customer. Current work structuring practices are driven by contracts, the history of trades, and the traditions of craft. As a result, they rarely consider alternatives for making the construction process more efficient. To illustrate current practice and the opportunities provided by work structuring, this case study discusses the installation of metal door frames at a prison project. Because the project is a correctional facility, the door <b>frame</b> <b>installation</b> process involves a special grouting procedure which makes the installation process less routine. Those involved recognized {{the difficulty of the}} situation but better solutions were impeded by normal practice. This case study thus provided the opportunity to illustrate how one may come up with alternative ways to perform the work without being constrained by contractual agreements and trade boundaries. By doing so, we illustrate what work structuring means. Local and global fixes for the system comprising walls and doors are explored. In addition, we discuss the importance of dimensional tolerances in construction and how these affect the handoff of work chunks from one production unit to the next...|$|E
40|$|Building {{information}} modelling {{has proven to}} be an effective tool for both engineering and construction management. It can be used from early conceptual design to detailed design and for creating construction phase models. It is also a practical tool for managing communication and other data between Designers, Constructor, Fabricators and Contractors. This Master’s thesis is a company specific case study and written for localizing potential in more BIM based project management. Main objective of the research is to formulate a sketch of a suitable BIM based installation logistics and project management system focusing on packing management system and packing order. The research has been delimited to pertain steel frame elements of power plant engine hall. In order to achieve the main objective, installation logistics and other construction management related properties of the chosen softwares Tekla Structures and Tekla BIMsight are examined. Main interests of the constructor company concerning construction management and especially installation logistics are also localized. Furthermore, quality standards for modelling and packing process are defined to achieve the main objective. As a result, findings of the research and suggested tools are evaluated based on the needs of the constructor. Tekla Stuctures can be used for conceptual design, for generating drawings and report, and for erection scheduling. In addition, it {{has turned out to be}} practical software for managing frame element delivery and data needed for site management. Organizer found in Tekla Structures especially is a handy tool for managing information needed for coordination of a site and frame element delivery. Tekla BIMsight is software for project collaboration and can be used for combining the models of different project stakeholders and for frame element unloading and installation management. Tekla BIMsight is a practical tool for making assembly plans and progress reports of site installation works. It can also be used for the supervision of installation works, for frame element unloading and grouping, and for on-site collaboration between structural and MEP works. Use of note files compatible to Tekla Structures and Tekla BIMsight enables BIM based communication between Structural Designers, Project Engineers and Site Supervisors throughout the project. The best way to ensure a practical frame element packing order is to attach an installation sequence number pointing out the required packing order for each steel assembly and to publish these numbers in an assembly list. It is also practical to divide an engine hall for modules and phases if needed using the Organizer tool in Tekla Structures, and to utilize this division for managing frame element delivery. Still, for developing installation logistics further, it is recommendable to seek better <b>frame</b> <b>installation</b> management through more integrated BIM based communication protocols...|$|E

2500|$|As the Navy's own shipyards {{lacked the}} {{capability}} to build ironclads at this time, Robeson approached four private shipyards—Harlan & Hollingsworth, William Cramp & Sons, John Roach & Sons and the Continental Iron Works, and offered them his [...] "repair" [...] contracts for Amphitrite, Terror, Miantonomoh and Puritan respectively. A fifth contract, for Monadnock, was accepted by a New York entrepreneur, Phineas Burgess. Continental Iron Works was the only firm to decline Robeson's offer, and consequently John Roach & Sons accepted the contracts to build both Puritan and Miantonomoh. However, Continental Iron Works would still participate in construction of the monitors through its supply of prefabricated ship parts to Burgess.

Fuels considered included diesel oil, natural gas, methanol and coal. These fuel feedstocks were considered not only on the cost and efficiency of the fuel conversion process, but also on complexity and integration of the fuel processor on system operation and thermal energy availability. After a review of fuel processor technology, catalytic steam reformer technology was selected based on the ease of integration and the economics of hydrogen production. The phosphoric acid fuel cell was selected for application at the GDSCC due to its commercial readiness for near term application.

40|$|In recent years, the {{photovoltaic}} {{market has}} grown significantly as module prices {{have continued to}} come down. Continued growth of the field requires higher efficiency modules at lower manufacturing costs. In particular, higher efficiencies reduce the area needed for a given power output, thus reducing the downstream balance of systems costs that scale with area such as mounting <b>frames,</b> <b>installation,</b> and soft costs. Cells and modules made from III-V materials have the highest demonstrated efficiencies to date but are not yet at the cost level of other thin film technologies, which has limited their large-scale deployment. There {{is a need for}} new materials growth, processing and fabrication techniques to address this major shortcoming of III-V semiconductors. Chapters 2 and 3 explore growth of InP on non-epitaxial Mo substrates by MOCVD and CSS, respectively. The results from these studies demonstrate that InP optoelectronic quality is maintained even by growth on non-epitaxial metal substrates. Structural characterization by SEM and XRD show stoichiometric InP can be grown in complete thin films on Mo. Photoluminescence measurements show peak energies and widths to be similar to those of reference wafers of similar doping concentrations. In chapter 4 the TF-VLS growth technique is introduced and cells fabricated from InP produced by this technique are characterized. The TF-VLS method results in lateral grain sizes of > 500 µm and exhibits superior optoelectronic quality. First generation devices using a n-TiO 2 window layer along with p-type TF-VLS grown InP have reached ~ 12. 1 % power conversion efficiency under 1 sun illumination with VOC of 692 mV, JSC of 26. 9 mA/cm 2, and FF of 65 %. The cells are fabricated using all non-epitaxial processing. Optical measurements show the InP in these cells have the potential to support a higher VOC of ~ 795 mV, which can be achieved by improved device design. Chapter 5 describes a cost analysis of a manufacturing process using an InP cell as the active layer in a monolithically integrated module. Importantly, TF-VLS growth avoids the hobbles of traditional growth: the epitaxial wafer substrate, low utilization efficiency of expensive metalorganic precursors, and high capital depreciation costs due to low throughput. Production costs are projected to be $ 0. 76 /W(DC) for the benchmark case of 12 % efficient modules and would decrease to $ 0. 40 /W(DC) for the long-term potential case of 24 % efficient modules...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{performance}} of a window depends on its thermal transmittance, the glazing solar transmittance, and the air leakage due to the <b>frame</b> and <b>installation</b> airtightness. In new installations air leakage represents a quite small term which is almost independent {{from the window and}} in particular from the glazing system selection. The contributions of the two other terms to the building thermal balance are not independent to each other: the most effective thermal insulating glazing, as triple glazings, are generally characterized by low solar transmittance reducing solar gains. The thermal energy balance of the building is then affected not only in summer but also in winter, potentially increasing heating energy need. This work evaluates the impact of different kinds of glazing systems (two double and two triple glazings), window size (from 16 % to 41 % of window to floor area ratio), orientation of the main windowed façade and internal gains on winter and summer energy need and peak loads of a well insulated residential building. The climatic data of four localities of central and southern Europe have been considered: Paris, Milan, Nice and Rome.
