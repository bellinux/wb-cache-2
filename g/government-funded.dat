5|$|Contemporary art is {{featured}} in both <b>government-funded</b> art spaces and private commercial galleries. The <b>government-funded</b> institutions include the Jehangir Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Modern Art. Built in 1833, the Asiatic Society of Bombay {{is one of}} the oldest public libraries in the city. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (formerly The Prince of Wales Museum) is a renowned museum in South Mumbai which houses rare ancient exhibits of Indian history.|$|E

The choristers include fourteen boys and fourteen girls, who are educated at Bristol Cathedral Choir School, the first <b>government-funded</b> choir academy in England. Choral evensong is sung daily during term.|$|E
5|$|Although NASA was {{supporting}} {{his work with}} grants of up to $500,000 per year, O'Neill became frustrated by the bureaucracy and politics inherent in <b>government-funded</b> research. He thought that small privately funded groups could develop space technology faster than government agencies. In 1977, O'Neill and his wife Tasha founded the Space Studies Institute, a non-profit organization, at Princeton University. SSI received initial funding of almost $100,000 from private donors, and in early 1978 began to support basic research into technologies needed for space manufacturing and settlement.|$|E
5|$|By 1965 pirate radio had a British {{audience}} of 10 to 15 million, and by 1966 sold almost £2million worth of advertising {{a year to}} customers including the <b>government-funded</b> Egg Marketing Board. Radio Caroline's audience was one third {{the size of the}} Light Programme in the parts of the country where it could be received, but the Light Programme's audience did not decrease, indicating that pirate radio appealed to an audience that the BBC did not serve.|$|E
5|$|Neuner {{has lived}} in the Bavarian village of Wallgau since birth. At the age of 16, she joined the German Customs Administration to {{become a member of the}} <b>government-funded</b> Customs-Ski-Team. Since winning three world {{championship}} gold medals in 2007, Neuner is one of her home country's most popular female athletes. She was named German Sportswoman of the Year in 2007, 2011 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{stated that}} it wished to run up to four multichannels at {{different}} times of the day or alternatively offer an HDTV service. It claimed that up to $100 million would be needed to prepare for these services, half of which would need to be <b>government-funded.</b> Other interested parties, such as internet service provider OzEmail argued for the provision of spectrum for interactive services, while Telstra, shareholder in the subscription television provider Foxtel, supported ASTRA's argument for a competitive bidding process for digital spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Blissymbols {{were first}} used in Canada in 1971 to provide {{communication}} to those {{not able to}} use traditional orthography; their use quickly spread to other countries. With improved technology, keyboard communication devices developed in Denmark, the Netherlands and the US increased in portability; the typed messages were displayed on a screen or strip of paper. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, communication devices were being commercially produced, and a few, such as the HandiVoice, had voice output. Countries such as Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom initiated <b>government-funded</b> services for those with severe communication impairments, including developing centres of clinical and research expertise.|$|E
5|$|Coolsma left Cianjur in 1869 {{and went}} to Bogor, also a majority-Sundanese city. He found little success in preaching to the European {{citizens}} of the city or converting the Sundanese. On 31 May 1869, he opened a school at his home, which provided a free education in both secular and religious studies. The first class had ten students, a total which grew quickly; at its peak, the school had 111 students. After a <b>government-funded</b> school was opened in 1872, most of the Sundanese students moved there to avoid the Christian teachings. The remaining students were mostly ethnic Chinese, few of whom converted.|$|E
5|$|Hives further {{recommended}} that a factory be built near Glasgow {{to take advantage}} of the abundant local work force and the supply of steel and forgings from Scottish manufacturers. In September 1939, the Air Ministry allocated ₤4,500,000 for a new Shadow factory. This <b>government-funded</b> and -operated factory was built at Hillington starting in June 1939 with workers moving into the premises in October, one month after the outbreak of war. The factory was fully occupied by September 1940. A housing crisis also occurred at Glasgow where Hives again asked the Air Ministry to step in.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s statues were erected for the {{two leaders}} of the Dacian kingdom, Burebista and Decebalus. These came {{as part of a}} gradual process of {{disassociation}} of Socialist Romania from the Soviet Union. The statues depict the kings as freedom fighters, and nationwide celebrations were held for the anniversaries of ancient battles. Additionally two <b>government-funded</b> film productions were created as part of this same process. Both of the films focus on the history of Dacia in the first and second century AD and the exploits of Decebalus, while Burebista is almost ignored.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba's largest {{employers}} are government and <b>government-funded</b> institutions, including crown corporations and services like hospitals and universities. Major private-sector {{employers are}} The Great-West Life Assurance Company, Cargill Ltd., and James Richardson and Sons Ltd. Manitoba also has large manufacturing and tourism sectors. Churchill's Arctic wildlife {{is a major}} tourist attraction; the town is a world capital for polar bear and beluga whale watchers. Manitoba is the only province with an Arctic deep-water seaport which is located in Churchill, which links to the shortest shipping route between North America, Europe and Asia.|$|E
5|$|Shopping malls in Johor Bahru include Johor Bahru City Square, Holiday Plaza, Komtar JBCC, KSL City, Plaza Pelangi, Sutera Mall, Plaza Kotaraya and Danga City Mall. New malls {{continue}} to be constructed in the city. The Mawar Handicrafts Centre, a <b>government-funded</b> exhibition and sales centre, is located along the Sungai Chat road and sells various batik and songket clothes. Opposite this is the Johor Area Rehabilitation Organisation (JARO) Handicrafts Centre which sells items such as hand-made cane furniture, soft toys and rattan baskets made by the physically disabled.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{were glad}} {{to be free from}} the {{distraction}} of reporters. The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods. After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights made a decision to begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane. This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor <b>government-funded</b> (unlike other experimenters such as Ader, Maxim, Langley and Alberto Santos-Dumont). The Wright brothers did not have the luxury of being able to give away their invention; it was to be their livelihood. Thus, their secrecy intensified, encouraged by advice from their patent attorney, Henry Toulmin, not to reveal details of their machine.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1948, {{the pair}} left {{to work on}} a <b>government-funded</b> {{groundnut}} food scheme in East Africa. There was some difficulty in getting permission for Judy to travel, and it was feared that she and Williams would be split up. This issue was promoted in the Evening Standard, and after the involvement of William Lever, 2nd Viscount Leverhulme, permission was given for Judy to travel with Williams. She had a third and final litter of puppies during her time in Africa. After two years there, Judy was discovered to have a mammary tumour; an operation removed the growth, but a tetanus infection soon set in, and she was euthanized on 17 February 1950 at the age of nearly 14. She was buried in her RAF jacket, with her campaign medals, the Pacific Star, the 1939–1945 Star, and the Defence Medal. Frank spent two months building a granite and marble memorial in her memory, which included a plaque that told of her life story.|$|E
5|$|The Boulonnais {{is still}} bred in small numbers, with the American Boulonnais Horse Association {{estimating}} {{a population of}} fewer than 1,000 animals remaining in Europe. Many studs are <b>government-funded,</b> to prevent the breed from dying out. The majority of the breed, 95 percent, {{are located in the}} Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Normandy regions and 75 percent in just the Pas-de-Calais department of Nord-Pas-de-Calais alone. Although most Boulonnais are in France, a few are exported. In 1999, fifteen foals were exported to Brazil and one stallion to Argentina. On average, a little over a dozen horses a year are exported, mainly to Brazil and Belgium for breeding and to Germany for forestry work. A few horses live in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Luxembourg, as well as in North America. Since 2006, twenty horses, including two registry-approved breeding stallions, have been exported from France to Denmark to create a stud farm in that country.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest of}} those {{research}} institutes {{is a nonprofit}} research organization {{referred to as the}} Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). GTRI provides sponsored research in a variety of technical specialties including radar, electro-optics, and materials engineering. Around forty percent (by award value) of Georgia Tech's research, especially <b>government-funded</b> classified work, is conducted through this counterpart organization. GTRI employs over 1,700 people and had $305 million in revenue in fiscal year 2014. The other institutes include: the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering & Bioscience, the Georgia Tech Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology, the Georgia Tech Strategic Energy Institute, the Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems, the Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute, the Institute of Paper Science and Technology, Institute for Materials and the Institute for People and Technology.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, {{under the}} urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the {{spending}} of $8 million to study the collection and {{to begin the process}} of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of $66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. Aside from providing concise histories of the equipment, the report also made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the now <b>government-funded</b> collection. Historical significance to the United States was a criterion of the recommendations. Many of the pieces of equipment that did not meet the report's recommendations were sold or traded for pieces that had historical significance to the DL grounds on which the site is located.|$|E
