As with many fighting games, many of the new characters were heavily styled after already existing characters from the franchise. For example, new character Maxi has a fighting style and move set influenced by Soul Edge's Li Long (the only of the original starting characters not to return). In fact, Soulcalibur only added one original playing style, belonging to Ivy.

Consequently, Namco has been working since Soulcalibur to gradually separate the individual styles of the characters in order to make each one unique.|$|E
