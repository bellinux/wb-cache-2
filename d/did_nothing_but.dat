25|$|In his journals, Alexander Polovtsov, State Secretary during Alexander III's reign, left an unsympathetic {{portrayal}} of Grand Duchess Olga. Although he admitted she was clever, he described {{her as an}} acid-tongued, quarrelsome, idle woman, who <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> sit in her palace {{on the bank of}} the Neva river and gaze through the window onto the walking people and speak nasty things about them. Just a sharp-tongued high-society lady without any other hobbies but gossiping and caring about privileges for her children.|$|E

[...] He {{is known to have}} written a variety of music for the Busseto Philharmonic society, including vocal music, band music and chamber works, (and including an alternative overture to Rossini's Barber of Seville) [...] but few of these works survive. (He may have given instructions before his death to destroy his early works).|$|E

2500|$|Deploying Foucault's {{argument}} {{from the first}} volume of The History of Sexuality, Butler claims that any attempt at censorship, legal or otherwise, necessarily propagates the very language it seeks to forbid. As Foucault argues, for example, the strict sexual mores of 19th century Western Europe <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> amplify the discourse of sexuality they sought to control. Extending this argument using Derrida and Lacan, Butler claims that censorship is primitive to language, and that the linguistic I is a mere effect of an originary censorship. In this way, Butler questions the possibility of any genuinely oppositional discourse; [...] "If speech depends upon censorship, then the principle that one might seek to oppose is at once the formative principle of oppositional speech".|$|E
2500|$|His sculptures {{have never}} {{inspired}} the admiration given those of Michelangelo, especially the colossal (5.05 m) marble group of Hercules and Cacus (completed in 1534) in the Piazza della Signoria, Florence, and Adam and Eve in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, which both stand {{within sight of}} some of Michelangelo's masterworks. Vasari said of him [...] "He <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> make bozzetti and finished little", and modern commentators have remarked on the vitality of Bandinelli's terracotta models contrasted with the finished marbles: [...] "all the freshness of his first approach to a subject {{was lost in the}} laborious execution in marble... A brilliant draughtsman and excellent small-scale sculptor, he had a morbid fascination for colossi which he was ill-equipped to execute. His failure as a sculptor on a grand scale was accentuated by his desire to imitate Michelangelo." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rav Ashi deduced from [...] {{that as long}} as {{a person}} has the {{obligation}} to bury a body, {{it is as if the}} corpse lay before the person. [...] says: [...] "And Abraham rose up from before his dead," [...] indicating that he departed from the presence of Sarah's body. And then [...] says: [...] "that I may bury my dead out of my sight," [...] showing that Abraham still spoke as if Sarah's corpse were lying before him. (And this status affects a person's obligation to perform other commandments.). Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1997[...] Similarly, Rabbi Johanan taught that we learn from the words, [...] "And Abraham rose up from before his dead and spoke," [...] in [...] that one whose dead lies before him is exempt from reciting the Shema (as the verse implies that until Sarah's burial, Abraham <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> make arrangements for it)..|$|E

2500|$|Bede {{tells us}} that Owin was working outside the oratory at Lichfield. Inside, Chad studied alone because the other monks were at worship in the church. Suddenly Owin {{heard the sound of}} joyful singing, coming from heaven, at first to the south-east, but {{gradually}} coming closer until it filled the roof of the oratory itself. Then there was silence for half an hour, followed by the same singing going back the way it had come. Owin at first <b>did</b> <b>nothing,</b> <b>but</b> about an hour later Chad called him in and told him to fetch the seven brothers from the church. Chad gave his final address to the brothers, urging them to keep the monastic discipline they had learnt. Only after this did he tell them that he knew his own death was near, speaking of death as [...] "that friendly guest who is used to visiting the brethren". He asked them to pray, then blessed and dismissed them. The brothers left, sad and downcast.|$|E
2500|$|Because of its {{themes of}} fornication, drug addiction, prostitution, violence, and murder, Porgy and Bess {{proved to be}} {{difficult}} to cast. Many black actors felt the story <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> perpetuate negative stereotypes. Harry Belafonte thought the role of Porgy was demeaning and declined it. So many performers refused to participate in the project that Goldwyn actually considered Jackie Robinson, Sugar Ray Robinson and singer Clyde McPhatter for major roles. [...] Only Las Vegas entertainer Sammy Davis, Jr. expressed interest in appearing in the film, and arranged to audition for a role during a party at Judy Garland's home. Ira Gershwin's wife Lee was present and, horrified by Davis' vulgarity, implored Goldwyn, [...] "Swear on your life you'll never use him." [...] The producer, who sneeringly called Davis [...] "that monkey," [...] assured her he would not cast him and offered the role of Sportin' Life to Cab Calloway instead. When Calloway declined, Davis had Frank Sinatra and some of his associates pressure Goldwyn, who finally announced to Davis, [...] "The part is yours. Now will you get all these guys off my back?" ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the final}} {{preparations}} in 1834 for the staging of Puritani {{and up to}} its delay into 1835, Bellini had concluded an agreement with Naples to present three operas there—including the re-writing of parts of the music for Malibran—beginning in the following January. All that went by the wayside when the revised score failed to arrive on time, and performances were abandoned and the contract scrapped. Thus, during March, Bellini <b>did</b> <b>nothing,</b> <b>but</b> did attend the final performance of Puritani on 31st. On 1 April, he wrote a very lengthy letter to Ferlito laying out {{the entire history of}} his life in Paris to date, as well as reviving the old jealousies about Donizetti and Rossini's so-called [...] "enmity" [...] toward him. [...] He ended by mentioning that [...] "my future plans are to be able to arrange a contract with the French Grand Opéra and remain in Paris, making it my home for the present. [...] Additionally, he discusses the prospect of marriage to a young woman who [...] "is not rich, but she has an uncle and aunt who are: if they will give her 200,000 francs, I'll marry her", but remarks that he is in no hurry.|$|E
