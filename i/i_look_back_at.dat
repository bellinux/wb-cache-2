5|$|Those {{lyrics are}} crazy. I {{listen to that}} like, 'What was she doing?' Pharrell's just so creative, I {{remember}} back then, and he's always kind of been the same. He's always so positive and so sure and he never wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not like anything else?' <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> that whole record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' You only get {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|E
500|$|Working in {{this fashion}} profoundly {{influenced}} everyone involved with the show. Series star Kyle Chandler said: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> my life, I'm going to say, 'Wow, [...] Peter Berg really changed my life.'" [...] Executive producer and head writer Jason Katims echoed this sentiment, saying: [...] "When I first came on [...] set, I thought, it’s interesting – this is what I imagined filmmaking would be, before I saw what filmmaking was." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Feynman {{likewise}} held {{a favorable}} {{view of the}} house and of his tenure as Telluride House Faculty Fellow. In an interview he described the House as [...] "a group of boys that have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness or whatever it is, to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains". He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that [...] "it’s there that I did the fundamental work" [...] for which he won the Nobel Prize. In a correspondence with a fellow Telluride associate congratulating him on the Nobel Prize, Feynman said, [...] "It was at Telluride that I did do all that stuff for which I got the prize, so <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> those days with nostalgia." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the {{platform}} {{when we had}} left it far behind, and saw the tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and gazing after us.|$|R
6000|$|Every time <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the poor, humbled little chap, {{my heart}} tingled with pity and remorse. [...] "We were too rough," [...] I said. [...] "We {{must be more}} gentle." ...|$|R
500|$|The album also {{received}} a number of accolades including a BRIT Award nomination for Best Female Artist and two Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Album and Best Female Rock Performance for the album's third single, [...] "This Is Love". However, most notably, Harvey was nominated for, and won, the 2001 Mercury Music Prize. The awards ceremony was held {{on the same day}} as the 11 September attacks on the United States and Harvey was on tour in Washington, D.C., one of the affected cities, when she won the prize. Reflecting on the win in 2011, she said: [...] "quite naturally <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> that and only remember the events that were taking place across the world and to win the prize on that day — it didn't have much importance {{in the grand scheme of}} things", noting [...] "it was a very surreal day". The same year, Harvey also topped a readers' poll conducted by Q Magazine of the 100 Greatest Women in Rock Music.|$|E
500|$|The British POWs {{provided}} the Americans with necessary advice regarding the camp life and shared rations and clothing {{sent by the}} British Red Cross. The British, {{who were in the}} process of digging an escape tunnel, requested help from the Americans. Juskalian would later describe the operation: [...] "I volunteered, although I have had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut me up in a wood bin for a prank. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it, I wonder how I did it. Some nights when I think about it, I break out in a cold sweat. Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E
500|$|Like her 2000 studio album, Music, Madonna {{enlisted the}} help of French DJ and {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Always interested in adapting herself and her music to the contemporary compositions, Madonna was inspired by the new Massive Attack and Lemon Jelly albums. [...] "We set out to put the two worlds of acoustic and electronic music together," [...] said Madonna. [...] "It is another step on, but I've never wanted to repeat myself. I don't ever want to repeat myself or make the same record twice." [...] American Life became Madonna's final studio album with Maverick Records, and marked the end of an eleven-year recording history with the label. In an interview with VH1 titled Madonna Speaks, the singer discussed her 20 years in the music industry, and revealed her motivations behind American Life, about [...] "material things" [...] being unimportant. [...] "I have lots of 'material' things and I've had lots of beliefs about things and what's important, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the 20 years behind me and I realized that {{a lot of things that}} I'd valued weren't important", she concluded. Discussing her thoughts on the conception of the album, she told Q magazine that through her 20 years of being in the entertainment industry, she would have a correct opinion on fame and fortune and its perils, which would be the base of the album.|$|E
6000|$|... "So, <b>I</b> just <b>looked</b> at him--coolly, you know, {{and looked}} <b>at</b> her. Then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him again--taking my time, you know. 'I don't think that that's a fair {{question}} to put to me,' says I." ...|$|R
60|$|She said nothing. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{her from}} the door. Her eyes were fixed upon me, a little distended, full of mute questioning. I only shook my head. So I left her and passed out into the night.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stewart {{ran after}} us {{for more than}} a mile, and I could not [...] help {{laughing}} as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> last and saw him on a hill, [...] holding his hand to his side, and nearly burst with running.|$|R
2500|$|Jason Gibson, {{the founder}} of Corbin Fisher, who uses the same name as an alias, {{previously}} held jobs including police officer and human resources manager. With a prior interest in pornography, Fisher began to film men during his weekends off from these jobs. In January 2004, he started the website CorbinFisher.com, and the business grew quickly since then. AmateurCollegeMen.com was also started in 2004. In a 2006 interview, he told Adult Video News, [...] "It was a steep learning curve. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> some of my earliest work and cringe. Filming sex and getting the right shots while retaining some semblance of naturalness and spontaneity is {{not as easy as}} it sounds." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a {{successful}} audition {{in the spring}} of 1937, Scourby was cast in a small part in a recording of Antony and Cleopatra. During the following summer he was, again, the player king in a production of Hamlet in Dennis, Massachusetts that featured Eva Le Gallienne. When he returned to audition for the American Foundation for the Blind later in the year he was told that the company of actors was [...] "filled" [...] but that he might record a novel if he wished. [...] "That was the beginning of it," [...] he recalled years later, adding, [...] "The recordings for the blind are perhaps my greatest achievement. Most of the things <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> in the theater were either insignificant parts in great plays or good parts in terrible plays. So it really doesn't amount to anything. Whereas I have recorded some great books. The greatest one being the Bible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Webb {{also stated}} that Deschanel's {{character}}, Summer, {{is based on a}} stock character type; [...] "Yes, Summer is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase." [...] Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. [...] "I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken. But when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> me in my heartbroken phase, it's pretty hilarious, because it felt so much more extreme than it really was. One of the things I love about 500 Days of Summer is that it doesn't make light of what we go through in romances, but it is honest about it and shows it for what it is, which is often profoundly funny".|$|E
60|$|Stewart {{ran after}} us, a childish thing to do, {{for more than}} a mile; and I could not help laughing, as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> last and saw him on a hill, holding his hand to his side, and nearly burst with running.|$|R
60|$|How? Where? <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{the last}} page of writing. But my {{attention}} wandered strangely; I confused one paragraph with another; the longer I read, the less I was able to grasp the meaning, not of sentences merely, but even of the simplest words.|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> the stile <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> his {{receding}} figure. His bearing {{had changed}} remarkably, he seemed limp, shrunken. The contrast {{with his former}} gesticulating, zuzzoing self took me in some absurd way as pathetic. I watched him out of sight. Then wishing very heartily I had kept to my own business, I returned to my bungalow and my play.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] George answered. [...] "It isn't {{altogether}} a novelty. I once {{spent three}} years in manual labor; and now when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> them, I believe I was happy then." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{look and}} see it there, shrinking, shrinking, [...] <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it amid the rain For the very last time; for my sand is sinking, [...] And I shall {{traverse}} old love's domain [...] Never again.|$|E
60|$|Still {{clinging}} to the past--that past which I represented to her, in my way, as Miss Halcombe did in hers! It troubled me sorely to see her looking back, {{at the beginning of}} her career, just as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the end of mine.|$|E
60|$|Estella took {{no notice}} {{of either of}} us, but led us the way that I knew so well. I {{followed}} next to her, and Joe came last. When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on {{the tips of his}} toes.|$|R
60|$|She {{kissed me}} {{two or three}} times--good, hearty smacks! did I not say {{she was still a}} child?--and stood waving her hand to me as I rode away. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the end of the avenue and saw her {{standing}} there, short-skirted and hatless, fronting the lowering sun with those fearless eyes of hers. So <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> my last on the child Betty.|$|R
60|$|With {{that answer}} he retraced his steps. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the cottage {{and saw the}} clerk coming out, with the lantern lighted once more. I took the old man's arm to help him on the more quickly. We hastened along the lane, and passed {{the person who had}} accosted me. As well as I could see {{by the light of the}} lantern, he was a servant out of livery.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mad is {{the right}} word! <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> my own infatuation--and I can't account for it; I can't {{understand}} myself. What was there in you," [...] she asked, with an outbreak of contemptuous surprise, [...] "to attract such a woman as I am?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{those words}} {{by the light}} of later events; and I {{pronounce}} them, as you will soon pronounce them, to be the words of an essentially rash man, whose hasty judgment never stopped to consider what surprises time and chance together might have in store for him.|$|E
60|$|I wonder, when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it, {{at my own}} obstinacy. I am almost {{ashamed to}} relate that I made Mr. Playmore no reply. He waited, still looking at me. I felt irritated by that fixed look. I arose, and stood before him with {{my eyes on the}} floor.|$|E
60|$|And {{they were}} sincere, these two women. They were drunk with {{conviction}} of {{the superiority of}} their class and of themselves. They had a sanction, in their own class-ethic, for every act they performed. As I drove away from Mrs. Pertonwaithe's great house, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it, and <b>I</b> remembered Ernest's expression that they were bound to the machine, but that they were so bound that they sat on top of it.|$|R
60|$|She {{left the}} room for the second time. For the second time my uncle looked at me in blank perplexity--and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him in the same {{condition}} of mind. The sound of the luncheon bell was equally a relief to both of us. Not a word more was spoken {{on the subject of}} the new groom. His references were verified; and he entered the General's service in three days' time.|$|R

60|$|I {{believe if}} I {{made an effort}} I could disinter some dozens of such memories, more and more faded until the {{marginal}} ones would be featureless and all but altogether effaced. As <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it now I am struck by an absurd image; {{it is as if}} a fish nibbled at this bait and then at that.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was settled,--before Friday. Indeed, as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it all now, I {{can hardly}} tell {{when it was}} not settled. It is impossible, and has been impossible, that I should do otherwise. I still hold my place, Madame Goesler, but I have {{declared}} that I shall give it up before the debate comes on." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{may be that}} {{affection for}} me caused him to overrate the {{progress}} that I made and the aptitude I showed; {{it may even be}} that what he said was no more than the good-natured flattery of one who loved me and would have me take pleasure in myself. And yet when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the lad I was, I incline to think that he spoke no more than sober truth.|$|E
60|$|I {{opened the}} door and entered. The room was dimly lit by a lamp, placed on the table near the window. Upon the bed, covered by a sheet, his waxen-like face alone visible, was the body of the man who had been my guest. Beyond, with the {{connecting}} door wide open, was the anteroom where the nurse had been sleeping. Except for the ticking of a clock, there was no sound to be heard; there was no sign anywhere of any disturbance or disorder. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the nurse for an explanation.|$|R
