5|$|Dogs {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research, testing, and educationâ€”particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the <b>Humane</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.|$|E

His doctoral dissertation at Louis Pasteur University in Strasbourg focused on [...] "ethology and ecology of the Beech Marten." [...] In the late 1960s and 1970s, he fought {{for the preservation of}} wildlife and natural areas across Franch, such as reintroducing beavers in Alsace and arguing against road construction or industrial sites in and around Vanoise National Park. He became regional president and then secretary general of the Alsace Federation within the Regional Association for the Protection of Nature (which was the regional branch of the French Federation <b>of</b> <b>Humane</b> <b>Societies</b> <b>of</b> Nature and Environment, now called France Nature Environment).|$|R

5|$|In March 2006, Mills and McCartney {{travelled}} to Canada {{to bring}} attention to the country's annual seal hunt. Sponsored by the <b>Humane</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> the United States, they complained that the hunt was inhumane, and called on the Canadian government {{to put an end}} to it. Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live. Mills and McCartney protested against seals being clubbed to death, pierced with boat hooks and sometimes skinned alive. Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them on Larry King Live, the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to publicise the use of restrictive farrowing crates, which are used for sows who are suckling piglets. A video of the investigation was made available on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in circuses {{has also been}} controversial; the <b>Humane</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> the United States has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called bull hooks or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant. Despite this, he denied {{that any of these}} practices harm elephants. Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. Ralph Helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions. Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring elephants in May 2016.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, PETA {{went before}} Burger King's board of {{directors}} during its parent company's annual corporate meeting to request that poultry suppliers switched to a more-humane method of slaughter called controlled atmosphere killing (CAK). Instead of using its previous tactic of stating that the procedure is more humane, {{the group claimed that}} CAK was economically more feasible as it reduces the chances of injury to workers in poultry factories and it produces better products by preventing injury to the animal. Responding to the proposal in March 2007, Burger King announced it would make further changes to its animal-welfare policies. The new policies favor suppliers of chickens that utilize CAK rather than electric shock to knock birds unconscious before slaughter, and require its pork and poultry suppliers to upgrade the living conditions of pigs and chickens. Under the agreement, 2% of BK's North American egg suppliers are to use cage-free-produced eggs and 10% of pork suppliers are to use crate-free pigs for its pork products. PETA and the <b>Humane</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> the United States were quoted as saying that Burger Kingâ€™s initiatives put it ahead of its competitors in terms of animal rights and welfare and that they were hopeful that the new initiatives would trigger reform throughout the fast food industry as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Declawing {{is widely}} practiced but {{ethically}} controversial within the American veterinary community. Some American and Canadian veterinarians endorse the procedure, while some have criticized {{and refused to}} perform it. Two animal protection organizations in the US, the <b>Humane</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, discourage the procedure. The <b>Humane</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> the United States has supported legislation banning or restricting declawing.|$|E

5000|$|Richard D.

Whitehead left the Wisconsin <b>Humane</b> <b>Society</b> in 1906 and formed the short-lived Badger State <b>Humane</b> <b>Society.</b> Upon his retirement, he erected the R. D.
