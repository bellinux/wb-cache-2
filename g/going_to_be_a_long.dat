500|$|On October 30, 2006, {{before a}} crowd of about 100 people on the Naval Base San Diego waterfront, Hunter {{announced}} {{the formation of an}} exploratory committee to begin raising campaign funds and organizing supporters for the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nomination. He reasoned, [...] "his is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> road, it's a challenging road, there's going to be some rough and tumble, but I think it's {{the right thing to do}} for our country." [...] He did not seek advice from party leaders before making the decision. The New York Times described the move as a [...] "surprise." [...] Mesa College Political Science professor Carl Luna speculated that Hunter's run was an attempt to find [...] "something to do" [...] in preparation for his loss of the Armed Services Committee chairmanship with Democrats heavily favored to reclaim the House. Political analysts saw little chance for the campaign's success. Claremont McKenna College government professor Jack Pitney argued that due to low name recognition and [...] "no following within the party", Hunter [...] "faces extremely long odds".|$|E

Cook described her role as [...] "a very strong girl, very determined because her mother died a year earlier, {{right in front of}} her eyes, so she had to grow up quick." [...] Ellis described her role as [...] "a girl who can have some fun cause they're going on a trip and they're gonna have a good time, yet someone who can stand up to Clear, to come and challenge Clear on a race, and to bother with Clear." [...] Cook added that [...] "it's rare to find one strong female lead in a horror film, not to mention two [...]” Ellis and Perry were amazed by her sensitivity and vulnerability in her performance, and she was hired instantly. [...] " [...] were at the beginning of what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> successful career for her," [...] Perry cited. Michael Landes, who appeared in the TV series , was cast as Thomas Burke. Landes defined him as [...] "a real nice, decent guy who comes across this huge car accident [...] who is very intrigued to begin with" [...] and as [...] "the guy who bumps into the girl and he goes nuts as her protector." [...] Ellis pointed out that he [...] "just wanted to find someone who's young and who can relate to these kids. It wasn't an older guy, but still strong enough and yet sensitive. [...] brought this really good balance to his part." [...] Landes was cast a day after his audition, which caused flight schedule problems on his departure two days after and cancellation of his appointments.|$|E

2500|$|Carnahan’s first {{campaign}} for political office was in 1990, when he unsuccessfully ran for Congress in the 8th Congressional District against Republican U.S. Representative Bill Emerson, losing by 14 points, 57% to 43%. [...] Prior to challenging Emerson, {{by his own}} telling the then-32-year-old Carnahan had already [...] "been active in government and politics {{for most of my}} adult life." [...] Carnahan was active in several of his late father’s political campaigns, including successful bids for state treasurer (1980) and lieutenant governor (1988), and an unsuccessful race for governor (1984). [...] In January 1980, Carnahan slept for five days on the floor outside the Secretary of State’s Office in the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City, to ensure that his father’s name would be first on the ballot for Missouri State Treasurer when filing opened on January 8. [...] Said Carnahan, [...] "A lot of people get football tickets this way. [...] It’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> five days, so I guess we’ll get some sleeping bags and a TV in here."

He's not medically cleared, Mack has to go in and sort of change the medical records so that Jonas can keep on [...] We had a whole thing planned, it was going to be good." [...] Jonas would eventually leave the army due to his injuries coupled with combat stress and reunite with Molly. Mack would take over the team but at the end of the series would also leave for a training post after Tiffy becomes pregnant with their third child. Bob would be badly injured in a parachuting accident and join the CIA as their Unit liaison. Ryan would take a demotion to regain control of The Unit whilst Bridget Sullivan would be killed on a mission halfway through the season. Charles Grey would take over as team leader with Sam McBride as his deputy training replacements for the personnel they have lost.|$|E
