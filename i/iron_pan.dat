It is traditionally served up in a cast <b>iron</b> <b>pan</b> with bread to mop up the sauce. Some variations of the dish are cooked with liberal use of ingredients such as eggplant, chili peppers, hot paprika, spinach, feta cheese or safed cheese.|$|E

5000|$|Induction {{compatible}} cookware for an induction cooking surface can {{nearly always}} {{be used on}} other stoves. Some cookware or packaging is marked with symbols to indicate compatibility with induction, gas, or electric heat. Induction cooking surfaces work well with any pans with a high ferrous metal content at the base. Cast <b>iron</b> <b>pans</b> and any black metal or <b>iron</b> <b>pans</b> will work on an induction cooking surface. Stainless steel pans will work on an induction cooking surface if {{the base of the}} pan is a magnetic grade of stainless steel. If a magnet sticks well to the sole of the pan, it will work on an induction cooking surface. An [...] "all-metal" [...] cooker will work with non-ferrous cookware, but available models are limited.|$|R

60|$|We {{lay there}} (for the banks hid us), drank again and again, bathed our chests, let our wrists {{trail in the}} running water till they ached with the chill; and at last, being wonderfully renewed, we got out the meal-bag and made drammach in the <b>iron</b> <b>pan.</b> This, though it is but cold water mingled with oatmeal, yet makes a good enough dish for a hungry man; and {{where there are no}} means of making fire, or (as in our case) good reason for not making one, it is the chief {{stand-by}} of those who have taken to the heather.|$|E
60|$|In {{preparing}} the skins and skeletons of these animals, I was much {{troubled by the}} Dyak dogs, which, being always kept {{in a state of}} semi-starvation, are ravenous for animal food. I had a great <b>iron</b> <b>pan,</b> in which I boiled the bones to make skeletons, and at night I covered this over with boards, and put heavy stones upon it; but the dogs managed to remove these and carried away the greater part of one of my specimens. On another occasion they gnawed away {{a good deal of the}} upper leather of my strong boots, and even ate a piece of my mosquito-curtain, where some lamp-oil had been spilt over it some weeks before.|$|E
6000|$|Pan-hunting (used at salt-licks).--"Pan-hunting is {{a method}} of hunting deer at night. An <b>iron</b> <b>pan</b> {{attached}} to a long stick, serving as a handle, is carried in the left hand over the left shoulder; near where the hand grasps the handle, in a small projecting stick, forming a fork on which to rest the rifle, when firing. The pan is filled with burning pine-knots, which, being saturated with turpentine, shed a brilliant and constant light all around; shining {{into the eyes of}} any deer that may come in that direction, and making them look like two balls of fire. The effect is most curious to those unaccumstomed to it. The distance between the eyes of the deer as he approaches, appears gradually to increase, reminding one of the lamps of a travelling carriage." [...] (Palliser.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of modern gas stoves and microwave ovens {{has led to}} the adoption of new cooking techniques, mainly increasing the popularity of frying (meat, fish, vegetables). The modernization of kitchenware has deprived cauldrons, cast <b>iron</b> <b>pans,</b> and many wooden utensils of their traditional role. The average family now uses a wide range of aluminum and enameled cookware.|$|R

They gave us each a sword and pistols, though I professed my inability to use the former; and with these, and some ammunition, a bag of oatmeal, an <b>iron</b> <b>pan,</b> and a bottle of right French brandy, we were ready for the heather. Money, indeed, was lacking. I had about two guineas left; Alan's belt having been despatched by another hand, that trusty messenger had no more than seventeen-pence to his whole fortune; and as for James, it appears he had brought himself so low with journeys to Edinburgh and legal expenses on behalf of the tenants, that he could only scrape together three-and-five-pence-halfpenny, the most of it in coppers.|$|E

25|$|Cast iron {{cookware}} is slow to heat, {{but once}} at temperature provides even heating. Cast iron can also withstand very high temperatures, making cast <b>iron</b> <b>pans</b> ideal for searing. Being a reactive material, cast iron can have chemical reactions with high acid {{foods such as}} wine or tomatoes. In addition, some foods (such as spinach) cooked on bare cast iron will turn black.|$|R
50|$|By the 19th {{century the}} open-pan salt process had reached its zenith in Britain. Two {{principal}} regions of production existed, Worcestershire and Cheshire. Brine shafts were sunk {{to the level}} of the brine stream that flowed over the natural rock salt or halite.

6000|$|As we have said, {{just before}} Gertie's arrival Sam Natly chanced to be {{attempting}} to dine. The telegraph needles pointed to [...] "Line clear" [...] {{on both sides}} of him. Dinner consisted of a sort of Irish stew cooked in a little square <b>iron</b> <b>pan</b> that fitted into the small stove. Being a placid, good-humoured man, not easily thrown off his balance either mentally or physically, Sam smiled slightly to himself as he put the first bit of meat into his mouth. He thought of his wife, wished that she was there to assist in the eating of it and shut his lips on the savoury morsel. A piece of potato was arrested by the sharp telegraph bell--one beat--of warning. The potato followed the meat as he was in the act of rising. Sam touched his telegraphic bell in reply to his signal-friend on the right, and [...] "Train on line" [...] was marked by a telegraphic needle pointing to these words. As the train was yet a great way off, at least as to distance, he sat down again and disposed of bit number two. Number three followed, and he had made some approach to engulfing number four when a shrill whistle struck his ear. Up he sprang, glanced at the time-piece, wiped his mouth, and went to the levers. He touched his bell--a single note of warning to his signal-friend on the left and received a reply, one beat, meaning [...] "Ready." [...] The train appeared, came up like a rocket and went past like a thunderbolt. When Sam saw its red tail-light, and thus knew that all the train was there,--that none of the tail carriages or trucks had broken loose and been left behind,--he gave a mighty pull to one of the levers, which turned up the arms of his distant signal, and thus blocked the line to all other trains. The needle was now [...] "pegged down" [...] or fixed at [...] "Train on line," [...] so that there could be no mistake about it, and no trusting to memory. Having accomplished this, he went to a large book which lay open on a desk in a corner, glanced at the time-piece, recorded the passage of the train--a passenger one, and once more sat down to dinner.|$|E
