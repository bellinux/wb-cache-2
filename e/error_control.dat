25|$|The {{transport}} layer establishes basic data channels that applications use for task-specific data exchange. The layer establishes process-to-process connectivity, meaning it provides end-to-end {{services that are}} independent {{of the structure of}} user data and the logistics of exchanging information for any particular specific purpose. Its responsibility includes end-to-end message transfer independent of the underlying network, along with <b>error</b> <b>control,</b> segmentation, flow control, congestion control, and application addressing (port numbers). End-to-end message transmission or connecting applications at the {{transport layer}} can be categorized as either connection-oriented, implemented in TCP, or connectionless, implemented in UDP.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In <b>error</b> <b>controlled</b> packet reception, {{a packet}} is {{received}} only if its error probability {{can be kept}} below a predetermined level. <b>Error</b> probability <b>control</b> is achieved by posing a minimum {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) threshold with corresponding packet internal coding scheme, which upper-bounds the packet data rate. We first consider packet transmission over a single-user wireless fading channel with additive Gaussian noise. We derive the optimal SNR threshold that maximizes the communication throughput. We show under a set of generous conditions that the optimal SNR threshold in the low-SNR regime is proportional to the transmit power; the ratio depends neither on the packet internal coding scheme nor on the pre-determined error probability level. The result is then extended to packet multicasting where common information is transmitted to a group of receivers over fading channels. Index Terms — <b>Error</b> <b>controlled</b> reception, multicast, rate control, SNR threshold. I...|$|R

2500|$|During {{this time}} Tsien wrote Engineering Cybernetics which was {{published}} by McGraw Hill in 1954. The book deals with the practice of stabilizing servomechanisms. In its 18 chapters it considers non-interacting controls of many-variable systems, control design by perturbation theory, and von Neumann’s theory of <b>error</b> <b>control</b> (chapter 18). Ezra Krendel reviewed the book, stating that it is [...] "difficult to overstate the value of Tsien's book to those interested in the overall theory of complex control systems." [...] Evidently Tsien’s approach is primarily practical, as Kendel notes that for servomechanisms the [...] "usual linear design criterion of stability is inadequate and other criteria arising from the physics of the problem must be used." ...|$|E
2500|$|Colloquial {{usage of}} the term 'PSK31' in amateur radio usually implies {{the use of the}} most {{commonly}} used variant of PSK31: binary phase shift keying (BPSK). [...] BPSK uses no <b>error</b> <b>control,</b> but an allied mode, QPSK31 quadrature phase shift keying, uses four phases instead of two, to provide a degree of forward error correction. [...] It is simple to switch from BPSK to QPSK if difficulties arise during a contact. [...] When QPSK is used; after encoding into varicode, the binary signal is further transformed into a quaternary set of phase shifts. [...] A sliding window of five bits is used to select one of the four possible phase shifts, providing a means of error correction by spreading each bit of data across adjacent bits. [...] Successful decoding of an input bit requires a large number of phase shift sequences to be received, causing a 20-bit, 640-millisecond latency (delay) in the output of the decoder.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{describe}} {{the implementation of a}} numerical Hankel-Laplace inverter for computing thermoelastic laser generated ultrasound waves in isotropic solids. It was found in this work that numerical <b>error</b> <b>controls</b> that were generally adequate, for common laser pulse parameters and material properties, were not given in the literature. The authors also found that there were no numerical values available in the literature [1, 2], which researchers could use for comparison while developing their own computer codes. In this work, a numerical Hankel inverter is described for computing laser generated ultrasound waves. Empirically developed <b>error</b> <b>controls,</b> for both the Hankel and Laplace inverters, are also described, and the difficulties in implementing these inverters are discussed. Numerical values of waveforms are given at the end, which future researchers may use as benchmarks for developing their own computer programs.

40|$|Observable {{operator}} models (OOMs) are a {{class of}} models for stochastic pro-cesses which properly subsumes the class that can be modelled by finite-dimensional hidden Markov models (HMMs). One of the main advantages of OOMs over HMMs is that they admit asymptotically correct learning algorithms. A series of learning algorithms has been developed, with increasing computational and statis-tical efficiency, whose recent culmination was the <b>error</b> <b>controlling</b> (EC) algorithm developed by the first author. The EC algorithm is an iterative, asymptotically correct algorithm which yields (and minimizes) an assured upper bound on the modelling error. The runtime is faster {{by at least one}} order of magnitude than EM-based HMM learning algorithms, and yields significantly more accurate models than the latter. Here we present yet a significant improvement of the EC algo-rithm, the constructive <b>error</b> <b>controlling</b> (CEC) algorithm. CEC inherits from EC the main idea of minimizing an upper bound on the modelling error, but is con-structive where EC needs iterations. As a consequence, we obtain further gains in learning speed without loss in modelling accuracy...|$|R

Taking the  system and the disturbances compensator in series, a new augmented system is obtained.
