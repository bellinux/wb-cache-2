He had been waiting for her to find him.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} with the Brewers, the team was {{struggling}} and not likely to make a playoff run. When talks on a contract extension broke down, the team traded Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on July 27 in exchange for top infield prospect Jean Segura and pitchers Ariel Peña and Johnny Hellweg. Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin remarked {{that it was one}} of the tougher decisions <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> because he was very fond of Greinke.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his release}} from the {{hospital}} and as a prisoner of war—the exact date is unknown—Schnaufer took over the family wine business. He had never planned to run the family winery as his ambition had always been to pursue an officer's career in the Luftwaffe. However, {{in the immediate aftermath}} of World War II the business had virtually ceased to exist and Schnaufer was given the task of rebuilding it from scratch. He had to re-establish business links to suppliers and customers and to consolidate them. Then <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> new contacts in order to facilitate expansion and growth of the business. Lastly, he had to create an infrastructure which supported the growth of the business.|$|E

5|$|With Germany {{suffering}} major defeat on all fronts, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and {{his ring}} of conspirators decided to eliminate Hitler and the Nazi leadership, {{establish a new}} government and save the country from total destruction. On 20 July 1944, during a military conference at the Wolf's Lair, Stauffenberg planted a briefcase bomb underneath Hitler's conference table and then quickly left, claiming <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an important telephone call. Shortly after, the bomb exploded, fatally wounding three officers and the stenographer, who died shorty thereafter. Hitler survived with only minor injuries, as did everyone else who was shielded from the blast by the conference table leg.|$|E
5|$|A second {{hindrance}} to Sicilian architects' fully achieving {{their potential}} earlier was that frequently {{they were only}} rebuilding a damaged structure, {{and as a consequence}} having to match their designs to what had been before, or remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade's completion in 1760, but the compromises <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> in deference to the existing structure are obvious. While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in Ragusa, here in Modica the building is heavier, and lacks his usual lightness of touch and freedom of design.|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, Hamence earned {{selection}} for the match against Northamptonshire, batting at No. 4 and scoring 34; he partnered acting captain Hassett in {{a stand of}} 104 for the third wicket. He took 1/11 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings. In the second match before the Second Test, which was against Yorkshire, Hamence made 48 and six not out, and took a total of 1/17 as the game ended in a draw. He batted slowly and cautiously; Bradman gave him few opportunities, so <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the most of them. The first innings 48 was a determined performance on a sticky wicket that helped Australia to 249; Bradman felt that Hamence's grit was a notable factor in Australia managing to pass 200. Harvey made 49 and 56 while Brown made 19 and 113 as an opener. This was enough for Brown to retain his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team. Australia {{went on to a}} crushing win by 409 runs but Brown made only 24 and 32.|$|E

5|$|In 1905, a {{gold medal}} {{competition}} {{was sponsored by the}} Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters to investigate a method for measuring the surface tension of liquids that had been proposed by Lord Rayleigh in 1879. This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his own glassware, creating test tubes with the required elliptical cross-sections. He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the viscosity of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the Royal Society in London for publication in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|Edward Dalyngrigge was {{a younger}} son and thus {{deprived}} of his father's estates through {{the practice of}} primogeniture, hence <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his own fortunes. By 1378, he owned the manor of Bodiam by marrying into a land-owning family. From 1379 to 1388, Dalyngrigge was a Knight of the Shire for Sussex {{and one of the}} most influential people in the county. By the time he applied to the king for a licence to crenellate (build a castle), the Hundred Years' War had been fought between England and France for nearly 50years. Edward III of England (reigned 1327–1377) pressed his claim for the French throne and secured the territories of Aquitaine and Calais. Dalyngrigge was one of many Englishmen who travelled to France to seek their fortune as members of Free Companies– groups of mercenaries who fought for the highest bidder. He left for France in 1367 and journeyed with Lionel, Duke of Clarence and son of Edward III. After fighting under the Earl of Arundel, Dalyngrigge joined the company of Sir Robert Knolles, a notorious commander who was reputed to have made 100,000gold crowns as a mercenary from pillage and plunder. It was as a member of the Free Companies that Dalyngrigge raised the money to build Bodiam Castle; he returned to England in 1377.|$|E
5|$|Janáček {{originally}} intended to study piano and organ but eventually devoted himself to composition. He wrote his first vocal compositions while choirmaster of the Svatopluk Artisan's Association (1873–76). In 1874 he enrolled at the Prague organ school, under František Skuherský and František Blažek. His student days in Prague were impoverished; with no piano in his room, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> do with a keyboard drawn on his tabletop. His criticism of Skuherský's performance of the Gregorian mass {{was published in the}} March 1875 edition of the journal Cecilie and led to his expulsion from the school – but Skuherský relented, and on 24 July 1875 Janáček graduated with the best results in his class. On his return to Brno he earned a living as a music teacher, and conducted various amateur choirs. From 1876 he taught music at Brno's Teachers Institute. Among his pupils there was Zdenka Schulzová, daughter of Emilian Schulz, the Institute director. She was later to be Janáček's wife. In 1876 he also became a piano student of Amálie Wickenhauserová-Nerudová, with whom he co-organized chamber concertos and performed in concerts over the next two years. In February 1876, he was voted choirmaster of the Beseda brněnská Philharmonic Society. Apart from an interruption from 1879 to 1881, he remained its choirmaster and conductor until 1888.|$|E
