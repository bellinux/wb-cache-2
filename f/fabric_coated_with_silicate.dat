30|$|Mahltig et al. {{proposed}} {{the application of}} three different modified silica sols containing silver components onto polyamide fabrics, showing a lasting antimicrobial effect against E. coli even after 40 washing cycles [65]. The different sols (sol A, sol B, and sol C, respectively) were applied onto polyamide fabrics using a pad-dry-cure process. In {{order to determine the}} antimicrobial effect of the sol-gel coatings, the number of colony forming units was evaluated as the samples are prepared as well the number of washing cycles are increased up to 40 washes. It was observed that after coating preparation, the antimicrobial effect related to both sols A and B was lower in comparison with sol C. The main reason of this different behavior is related to the chemical composition of the sols. Although both sols A and B presented the same silver source (silver nitrate, AgNO 3), the sol C presented a different one (commercial colloidal silver). In addition, both sols B and C consisted of a quaternary ammonium compound such as hexadecyltrimethylammonium-p-toluenesulfonate (HTAT) used as a dispersing/stabilizing agent which is also well-known because of its antimicrobial activity. Due to this, sols B and C showed better results due to the presence of HTAT in their chemical composition in comparison with sol A. However, a drastic change in their antimicrobial effect was observed after 40 washing cycles because the polyamide <b>fabrics</b> <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> sol C lost all their antimicrobial activity. This important difference could be associated with the silver source in sol C (commercial colloidal silver) which was not so tightly fixed to the fabric surface. SEM images of the coatings showed particles of bigger size (micrometer range) with a flake shape for polyamide <b>fabrics</b> <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> sol C whereas particles of smaller size (below 100  nm) with a spherical shape were observed for <b>fabrics</b> <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> sols A and B. Due to this, the particles of bigger size are easily abraded under conditions of repeated washing cycles as it happens for sol C. When sol A with sol B was compared, smaller and more regular distribution of the in situ synthesized nanoparticles onto polyamide fabrics were observed for sol B, due to the use of a surfactant such as HTAT, and it is the reason of their higher durability under the conditions of repeated washing cycles with a better antimicrobial efficiency after 40  cycles.|$|R

30|$|Composite or {{laminated}} fabrics offer two advantages. First, they {{eliminate the}} labor involved in sequential upholstering of fabric layers, and second, they prevent exposure of underlying cushioning materials by ‘crack-opening’. When the multi-layered barrier fabric {{is exposed to}} flames, the heat is taken away by the outer coating or layer of the composite fabric, leaving the underlying substrate to which the coating or outer layer is laminated intact and preventing the involvement of underlying cushioning materials in the fire. For example, when a glass fiber <b>fabric</b> <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> polyvinyl chloride is exposed to flames, the polymer does not shrink away from the underlying glass fiber fabric.
