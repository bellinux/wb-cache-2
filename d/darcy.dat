5|$|A {{couple of}} months later, the Gardiners take Elizabeth {{on a trip to}} the Peak District; their visit also {{includes}} Darcy's estate, Pemberley; Elizabeth agrees to go with them, believing that he is away travelling. Elizabeth is stunned by its wealth and beauty, and hears nothing but good things about <b>Darcy</b> from his housekeeper. There, she accidentally runs into <b>Darcy,</b> who has arrived home early. He invites her and the Gardiners to meet his sister. His manners have softened considerably, and Georgiana takes an instant liking to Elizabeth. When Elizabeth learns that her immature and flirtatious youngest sister Lydia has run away with Wickham, she tearfully blurts out the news to <b>Darcy</b> and the Gardiners before returning home. Her family expects social ruin for having a disgraced daughter, but over a week later they are relieved to hear that Mr. Gardiner had discovered the pair in London and that they had married. Lydia later slips to Elizabeth that <b>Darcy</b> was the one who found them and paid for the marriage.|$|E
5|$|After the Holland fight, Dyer {{made several}} {{attempts}} at a rematch with <b>Darcy,</b> reportedly {{to the exclusion}} of other fights, in the belief that the encounter would draw a big crowd and a large purse. The postponed fight with Delmen was again mooted, but this too never occurred. In the meantime Dyer continued to busy himself with charity work, setting up a boxing fund for injured soldiers in Sydney, and continued to tour the vaudeville circuit in New South Wales. Dyer's persistence eventually paid off, and an encounter with <b>Darcy</b> was arranged for 9 October at Rushcutters Bay Stadium, with the Middleweight Championship title at stake. The fight was a one-sided affair, with Dyer outclassed throughout. Although <b>Darcy</b> was warned for a low blow in the fourth round, Dyer was never in the fight and his corner threw in the towel after one minute of the sixth round.|$|E
50|$|One {{application}} of <b>Darcy's</b> law is to analyze water flow through an aquifer; <b>Darcy's</b> law {{along with the}} equation of conservation of mass are equivalent to the groundwater flow equation, {{one of the basic}} relationships of hydrogeology.|$|R
30|$|Various authors give {{different}} limiting {{values for}} <b>Darcy’s</b> laminar flow, between {{a range of}} Re from 3 to 10 (Polubarinova-Kochina 1962). However, Muskat (1946) discussed that <b>Darcy’s</b> law {{can be applied to}} reservoirs flow problems whose conditions yield Reynolds number smaller that unity.|$|R
50|$|The trilogy {{of novels}} explores <b>Darcy's</b> {{perspective}} on the events of Pride and Prejudice - in particular focusing on his developing relationship with and feelings for Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the earlier novel. However, the novels also explore <b>Darcy's</b> character, life and interests within {{the social and political}} world of his time, and introduce in prominent roles characters who only briefly appeared in the earlier work or were not present at all, thus expanding on <b>Darcy's</b> life and character.|$|R
5|$|Growth of {{the textile}} {{industry}} was assisted by {{the availability of}} coal in the area. By 1896 John Fletcher had coal mines at Ladyshore in Little Lever; The Earl of Bradford had a coal mine at Great Lever; the <b>Darcy</b> Lever Coal Company had mines at <b>Darcy</b> Lever and there were coal mines at Tonge, Breightmet, Deane and Doffcocker. Some of these pits were close to the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal providing the owners with markets in Bolton and Manchester. Coal mining declined in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Bennet {{gives his}} consent after Elizabeth assures him {{of her love}} for <b>Darcy.</b> In the U.S. release of the film, an {{additional}} last scene shows the newlyweds outside of Pemberley, happy together.|$|E
5|$|The serial expands on Austen's metaphorical use of landscapes, {{reinforcing}} {{beauty and}} authenticity. Elizabeth takes {{every opportunity to}} enjoy nature and to escape exposure to Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine. The most symbolic use of nature in the novel is Elizabeth and the Gardiners' visit to Pemberley in Derbyshire, where Elizabeth becomes conscious of her love for <b>Darcy.</b> The story makes nature integral {{in the form of}} Old England. Elizabeth's appreciation of the beauties of Derbyshire elevates <b>Darcy</b> in her and her relatives' opinion. Darcy's gaze through the window works as a movie screen, projecting Elizabeth's actions for him and the viewer. His participation in the English landscape is his redemption.|$|E

5|$|Actress Jennifer Ehle {{was chosen}} out {{of half a}} dozen serious {{candidates}} to play Elizabeth, the second Bennet daughter, the brightest girl, and her father's favourite. At the time in her mid-20s, Ehle had first read Pride and Prejudice at the age of 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule. Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted Colin Firth, a relatively unknown British actor in his mid-30s at the time, to play the wealthy and aloof Mr. <b>Darcy.</b> Birtwistle had worked with him on the mid-1980s comedy film Dutch Girls, but he repeatedly turned down her offer as he neither felt attracted to Austen's feminine perspective nor believed himself to be right for the role. Birtwistle's persistent coaxing and his deeper looks into the <b>Darcy</b> character finally convinced him to accept the role. Firth and Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which only received media attention after the couple's separation.|$|E

He rejected this under {{the grounds that it}} was too short, and decided to part ways with the franchise. This upset many fans, who blamed Nolan's departure on Hašek's alleged attempt to rid him.|$|E

5|$|Pride and Prejudice is a six-episode 1995 British {{television}} drama, {{adapted by}} Andrew Davies from Jane Austen's 1813 {{novel of the}} same name. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth starred as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. <b>Darcy.</b> Produced by Sue Birtwistle and directed by Simon Langton, the serial was a BBC production with additional funding from the American A Network. BBC1 originally broadcast the 55-minute episodes from 24 September to 29 October 1995. The A Network aired the series in double episodes on three consecutive nights beginning 14 January 1996. There are six episodes in the series.|$|E
5|$|Reginald Walter <b>Darcy</b> Weaver (18 July 187612 November 1945) was an Australian {{conservative}} parliamentarian {{who served}} in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for 28 years. Serving from 1917 in the backbenches, he entered the cabinet of Thomas Bavin in 1929 as Secretary for Mines and Minister for Forests until he returned to opposition in 1930. Following the success of the United Australia Party in the 1932 election, Weaver returned as the Secretary for Public Works and Minister for Health in the Stevens ministry.|$|E
5|$|Selwood's year, {{during which}} he {{averaged}} more than 25disposals, 4marks, and 4tackles per game, was also rewarded with a top five finish in the Carji Greeves Medal (Geelong's Best and Fairest). He finished the season ranked within the top ten in the league for possessions (613), disposals per game (25.5), and handpasses (327). His total of 63free kicks earned during the season was also the highest recorded since the AFL began in 1990, breaking the previous record of 54 set by Luke <b>Darcy</b> five years earlier.|$|E
50|$|Morris Muskat et al. {{developed}} the governing equations for multiphase flow (one vector equation for each fluid phase) in porous media as a generalisation of <b>Darcy's</b> equation (or <b>Darcy's</b> law) for water flow in porous media. The porous media are usually sedimentary rocks such as clastic rocks (mostly sandstone) or carbonate rocks.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} modifications to <b>Darcy's</b> equation wherein the drag coefficient {{is a function}} of pressure, which is a realistic model for technological applications like enhanced oil recovery and geological carbon sequestration. We first outline the approximations behind <b>Darcy's</b> equation and the modifications that we propose to <b>Darcy's</b> equation, and derive the governing equations through a systematic approach using mixture theory. We then propose a stabilized mixed finite element formulation for the modified <b>Darcy's</b> equation. To solve the resulting nonlinear equations we present a solution procedure based on the consistent Newton-Raphson method. We solve representative test problems to illustrate the performance of the proposed stabilized formulation. One of the objectives of this paper is also to show that the dependence of viscosity on the pressure can have a significant effect both on the qualitative and quantitative nature of the solution...|$|R

5|$|The Duke {{occupied}} {{the post of}} Lord Warden until 1765, save for two periods when it was filled by James Butler, the Duke of Ormonde and John Sidney, the Earl of Leicester. He carried out extensive work to make the castle more habitable, building extensions towards the north bastion and constructing a small house in the south bastion for the soldiers. Under the subsequent Lord Wardens, the politicians Robert <b>Darcy,</b> the Earl of Holderness, and Francis North, the Earl of Guildford, the castle continued to house artillery but it became increasingly less military in character.|$|E
5|$|The {{first person}} to climb the {{mountain}} was Thomas Gerdine, along {{with a group of}} United States Geological Survey scientists, Sam Strom, A. H. Dubor, and <b>Darcy</b> Bard, in 1897. The volcano is also available to skiers. To reach the mountain itself, it takes 5 miles of walking along the White Chuck River Trail (Forest Service Trail No. 643) and up the Sitkum Glacier. The trail is reached via Forest Service Road No. 23. Mainly, the slopes consist of black diamonds for both the ascent and descent.|$|E
