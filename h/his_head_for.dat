Not wanting to start a shootout {{in front of the}} three attackers' wives and children, everyone waits until they have left. A moonlit gun battle ensues, with both sides suffering injuries.

25|$|The {{psychiatrist}} {{claims that}} Dahlgren considered Harok family {{a source of}} his stress, while he was indifferent to other persons including the girlfriend {{of one of the}} victims, a mail carrier, and a house cleaner who all made contact with Dahlgren either prior to or in between the killings. The psychiatrist was the first witness who was asked additional questions by Dahlgren; Dahlgren claimed he had been hearing voices in <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> two years every ten or fifteen seconds. Following this expert testimony, the defense attorney announced that the defense would order another expert witness testimony, while the judge adjourned the hearing until June 19.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} a major {{character}} in the original season of the animated television series Super Friends (1973). In this series, Aquaman was shown to display superstrength—hefting a bulldozer blade over <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>for</b> example, and using it to help stop a tidal wave. He also had encyclopedic knowledge of oceanography and oceanology, {{in addition to his}} more familiar water-breathing power and aquatic telepathy. However, this series has been blamed for making Aquaman unpopular, and even laughable, by reinforcing a weak image of the character. In the first two seasons of Super Friends, he was voiced by Norman Alden, {{and for the rest of}} the series he was voiced by Bill Callaway.|$|E

25|$|Film {{critics have}} cited Curly {{as the most}} popular member of the team. His childlike mannerisms and natural comedic charm (he had no {{previous}} acting experience) made him a hit with audiences, particularly children and women (the latter usually finding the trio's humor juvenile and uncouth). The fact that Curly had to shave <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> the act led him to feel unappealing to women. To mask his insecurities, he ate and drank to excess and caroused whenever the Stooges made personal appearances, which was approximately seven months of each year. His weight ballooned in the 1940s, and his blood pressure became dangerously high. Curly's wild lifestyle and constant drinking eventually {{caught up with him}} in 1945, and his performances suffered.|$|E

25|$|According to Hindu legend, there lived a demon (asura) Tharukasuran, who conquered Prithvi (earth) and Svarga (heaven). Indra, {{the leader}} of {{celestial}} deities and other gods suffered {{at the hands of}} Tharukasuran and sought the help of the creator-god Brahma, who asked them to worship Shiva in Thiruverumbur. In order to deceive Tharukasuran, the devas transformed into ants and reached the temple. Since the surface of the lingam (aniconic form of Shiva) was slippery, the ants found it difficult to climb up and worship. Shiva transformed himself into an ant hill and slid his head, which enabled the ants to climb and worship. Hence the name Erumbeeswarar is derived from Erumbu meaning ant and Easwaran referring to Shiva. This is one of the three places where Shiva slid <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> his worshippers, the other two being the temples at Virinjipuram and Thiruppanandal. The temple is also referred as Rathinakoodam, Thirverumbipuram, Erumbeesam, Brahmapuram, Laskhmipuram, Madhuvanam, Rathnakoodapuram, Manikoodapuram and Kumarapuram in various religious literature. The temple is locally called as Kailash (the abode of Shiva) of South India.|$|E

500|$|Ede Teller {{was born}} on January 15, 1908, in Budapest, Hungary (then part of Austria-Hungary), into a Jewish family. His parents were Ilona (born Deutsch), a pianist, and Max Teller, an attorney. He later became an agnostic. [...] "Religion {{was not an issue}} in my family", he later wrote, [...] "indeed, it was never discussed. My only {{religious}} training came because the Minta required that all students take classes in their respective religions. My family celebrated one holiday, the Day of Atonement, when we all fasted. Yet my father said prayers for his parents on Saturdays and on all the Jewish holidays. The idea of God that I absorbed was that it would be wonderful if He existed: We needed Him desperately but had not seen Him in many thousands of years." [...] Like Einstein and Feynman, Teller was a late talker. He developed the ability to speak later than most children but became very interested in numbers, and would calculate large numbers in <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> fun.|$|E
