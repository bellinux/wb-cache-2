5|$|Females lay {{from ten}} to three hundred eggs at a time, {{depending}} on species, <b>fertilising</b> {{them with the}} stored sperm as they do so. Many species deposit the eggs on moist soil or organic detritus, but some construct nests lined with dried faeces, and may protect the eggs within silk cocoons. In most species, the female abandons the eggs after they are laid, but some species in the orders Platydesmida and Stemmiulida provide parental care for eggs and young.|$|E
5|$|Reclamation methods varied {{somewhat}} {{during the}} 19th century, but three basic operations featured; constructing drains at appropriate intervals; building {{a system of}} roads to allow access to the land so that materials such as clay, lime or marl could be dumped on it, to give it body; and <b>fertilising</b> the land by adding manure, often {{in the form of}} the euphemistically named night soil, collected from neighbouring towns.|$|E
5|$|Males {{that have}} been unable to court a female {{successfully}} may try to achieve reproductive success in other ways. In sunfish species, like the bluegill, larger, older males known as parental males, which have successfully courted a female, construct nests for the eggs they fertilise. Smaller satellite males mimic female behaviour and coloration to access a nest and fertilise the eggs. Other males, known as sneaker males, lurk nearby and then quickly dash to the nest, <b>fertilising</b> on the run. These males are smaller than satellite males. Sneaker males also exist in Oncorhynchus salmon, where small males that were unable to establish a position near a female dash in while the large dominant male is spawning with the female.|$|E

60|$|The most {{remarkable}} {{point in this}} table is the small average number of seeds from the short-styled flowers when illegitimately <b>fertilised,</b> and the unusually large average number of seeds yielded by the illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> long- styled flowers, relatively in both cases to {{the product of the}} legitimately <b>fertilised</b> flowers. (1/18. H. Muller says 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 352, that the long-styled flowers, when illegitimately <b>fertilised,</b> yield as many seeds as when legitimately fertilised; but by adding up the number of seeds from all the capsules produced by the two methods of fertilisation, as given by him, I arrive at the results shown in Table 1.13. The average number in the long-styled capsules, when legitimately <b>fertilised,</b> is 91.4, and when illegitimately <b>fertilised,</b> 77.5; or as 100 to 85. H. Muller agrees with me that this is the proper manner of viewing the case.) The two legitimate unions compared with the two illegitimate together yield seeds in the ratio of 100 to 61.|$|R
60|$|Flowers legitimately <b>fertilised</b> set seeds under {{conditions}} which cause the almost complete failure of illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> flowers. Thus {{in the spring}} of 1862 forty flowers were <b>fertilised</b> {{at the same time in}} both ways. The plants were accidentally exposed in the greenhouse to too hot a sun, and a large number of umbels perished. Some, however, remained in moderately good health, and on these there were twelve flowers which had been <b>fertilised</b> legitimately, and eleven which had been <b>fertilised</b> illegitimately. The twelve legitimate unions yielded seven fine capsules, containing on an average each 57.3 good seeds; whilst the eleven illegitimate unions yielded only two capsules, of which one contained 39 seeds, but so poor, that I do not suppose one would have germinated, and the other contained 17 fairly good seeds.|$|R

Some Romans kept live, harmless snakes as household pets, and credited them with similarly beneficial functions.|$|E

60|$|We have {{hitherto}} treated of {{the fertility}} {{of the flowers}} of heterostyled plants, when legitimately and illegitimately <b>fertilised.</b> The present chapter will be devoted {{to the character of}} their offspring or seedlings. Those raised from legitimately <b>fertilised</b> seeds will be here called LEGITIMATE SEEDLINGS or PLANTS, and those from illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> seeds, ILLEGITIMATE SEEDLINGS or PLANTS. They differ chiefly in their degree of fertility, and in their powers of growth or vigour. I will begin with trimorphic plants, and I must remind the reader that each of the three forms can be <b>fertilised</b> in six different ways; so that all three together can be <b>fertilised</b> in eighteen different ways. For instance, a long-styled form can be <b>fertilised</b> legitimately by the longest stamens of the mid-styled and short-styled forms, and illegitimately by its own- form and mid-length and shortest stamens, also by the mid-length stamens of the mid-styled and by the shortest stamens of the short-styled form; so that the long-styled can be <b>fertilised</b> legitimately in two ways and illegitimately in four ways. The same holds good with respect to the mid-styled and short-styled forms. Therefore with trimorphic species six of the eighteen unions yield legitimate offspring, and twelve yield illegitimate offspring.|$|R

25|$|When {{the male}} has {{identified}} a suitable location, he deposits the spermatophore and then guides the female over it. This allows the spermatophore to enter her genital opercula, which triggers {{release of the}} sperm, thus <b>fertilising</b> the female. The mating process can take from 1 to 25+ hours and depends {{on the ability of}} the male to find a suitable place to deposit his spermatophore. If mating continues too long, the female may lose interest, ending the process.|$|E

25|$|Organic sources, namely urine, {{bone ash}} and (in the latter 19th century) guano, were {{historically}} of importance but had only limited commercial success. As urine contains phosphorus, it has <b>fertilising</b> qualities {{which are still}} harnessed today in some countries, including Sweden, using methods for reuse of excreta. To this end, urine {{can be used as}} a fertiliser in its pure form or part of being mixed with water in the form of sewage or sewage sludge.|$|E
60|$|Thirty long-styled flowers <b>fertilised</b> illegitimately {{by their}} own-form {{two sets of}} stamens yielded only eight very poor capsules; but long-styled flowers <b>fertilised</b> by bees with pollen from their own stamens {{produced}} numerous capsules containing on an average 21.5 seeds.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to assess}} the {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} (GHGs) from one kilogram of live weight cattle production from annual pastures, nitrogen (N) <b>fertilised</b> perennial pastures and non-N <b>fertilised</b> perennial pastures in Western Australia for different farming practices. Using streamlined life cycle assessment (SLCA) methodology, it was estimated that approximately 14. 30 kg, 12. 09 kg and 11. 0 kg of CO 2 -e of GHG emissions will be emitted from the production of one kilogram of live weight cattle from annual, non-N <b>fertilised</b> and N <b>fertilised</b> perennial pastures respectively. Enteric emissions account for a significant portion of GHG emissions (85 % from annual pasture and around 95 % from perennial pastures). Live weight yields from annual pasture emit more GHG emissions than do N <b>fertilised</b> and non-N <b>fertilised</b> perennial pastures. Although the inclusion of liming produces additional GHG emissions, the increase in productivity associated with these activities can actually offset GHG emissions when considered on a per kilogram basis. life cycle assessment; greenhouse gases; GHG emissions; pastures; live weight; streamlined LCA; Australia; cattle production; nitrogen fertilisation; farming practices; CO 2; carbon dioxide; carbon emissions; productivity...|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} factor dominating the river history in Bengal is the large proportion of silt carried by its rivers. It is the silt which has created the land and made it habitable by building it up through the centuries. It is silt which is <b>fertilising</b> the land, but the silt, {{which has been the}} most beneficial gift of nature, has also produced most of the river problems now confronting the people of Bengal. Silt deposited in the old river channel beds has forced them to change course, creating problems for abandoned areas while assisting in developing new areas.|$|E
500|$|Hippeastrum bulbs can {{be induced}} to rebloom yearly by {{mimicking}} {{the conditions in}} its natural environment (cool dry winters). When foliage starts to yellow, dormancy can be induced by withholding water and placing the plant in a cool [...] dark place for six to ten weeks or until buds start to show. Even when plants are thriving outdoors in temperate climates, dormancy can be induced by withholding watering and <b>fertilising</b> in the northern hemisphere autumn, and bringing indoors to a cool environment prior to the first frost. Leaves will usually wither during this period and a flower stem begin to emerge after eight to ten weeks.|$|E
60|$|We see in Tables 2/14 to 2/18 {{the number}} of {{capsules}} and of seeds produced, by crossing both forms of the oxlip in a legitimate and illegitimate manner with one another, and with the two forms of the primrose and cowslip. I may premise that the pollen {{of two of the}} short-styled oxlips consisted of nothing but minute aborted whitish cells; but in the third short-styled plant about one- fifth of the grains appeared in a sound condition. Hence {{it is not surprising that}} neither the short-styled nor the long-styled oxlip produced a single seed when <b>fertilised</b> with this pollen. Nor did the pure cowslips or primroses when illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> with it; but when thus legitimately <b>fertilised</b> they yielded a few good seeds. The female organs of the short-styled oxlips, though greatly deteriorated in power, were in a rather better condition than the male organs; for though the short-styled oxlips yielded no seed when <b>fertilised</b> by the long-styled oxlips, and hardly any when illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> by pure cowslips or primroses, yet when legitimately <b>fertilised</b> by these latter species, especially by the long-styled primrose, they yielded a moderate supply of good seed.|$|R
60|$|Under these circumstances, {{it seemed}} {{advisable}} to ascertain {{what would be}} the effect of legitimately crossing long-styled plants of the fourth illegitimate generation with pollen taken from non-related short-styled plants, growing under different conditions. Accordingly several flowers on plants of the fourth illegitimate generation (i.e., great-great-grandchildren of plants which had been legitimately <b>fertilised),</b> growing vigorously in pots in the greenhouse, were legitimately <b>fertilised</b> with pollen from an almost wild short-styled cowslip, and these flowers yielded some fine capsules. Thirty other flowers on the same illegitimate plants were <b>fertilised</b> with their own pollen, and these yielded seventeen capsules, containing on an average thirty-two seeds. This is a high degree of fertility; higher, I believe, than that which generally obtains with illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> long-styled plants growing out of doors, and higher than that of the previous illegitimate generations, although their flowers were <b>fertilised</b> with pollen taken from a distinct plant of the same form.|$|R
5|$|In <b>fertilised</b> queens, {{the ovaries}} only become active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina {{where there is}} a chamber called the spermatheca, in which the sperm from the mating is stored. Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be <b>fertilised.</b> Unfertilised eggs become haploid males; <b>fertilised</b> eggs grow into diploid females and queens. The hormones that stimulate the {{development}} of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant.|$|R
500|$|In the introduction, Darwin {{explained}} his aim of meeting complaints that detailed {{support for his}} theory was lacking in On the Origin of Species.

[...] He gave due credit to previous authors who had described the agency of insects in <b>fertilising</b> orchids, and all who had helped him.|$|E
500|$|The western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} visitor to the flowers. A territorial species, the territories are smaller when they contain more Adenanthos obovatus bushes. Their long curved bills fit the tube-like flowers exactly, so that the pollen-presenter brushes against the spinebill's head while it is probing for nectar. The birds then carry pollen from plant to plant, <b>fertilising</b> other plants. A field study marking the pollen with fluorescent dye found that pollen could be deposited on flowers of plants up to [...] away from the original flower visited. The New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) [...] and brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta) have also been recorded with pollen from A. obovatus. The silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) drinks nectar from the flowers, but punctures the tube with its short bill. Larger honeyeaters in one field study tended to avoid A. obovatus, possibly seeking sources of more abundant nectar elsewhere. These species are too heavy for the fine branches and their bills are too large for the tubes.|$|E
500|$|Pollinated {{primarily}} by honeyeaters, the inflorescences appear from September to December. Prominent flowers, a red or pink colour, a straight style and a tubular perianth are features thought to promote pollination by birds. The structure of B.cuneatas flower, with the style end {{functioning as a}} pollen presenter, suggests that autogamous self-fertilisation must be common. This is countered, however, by protandry: pollen is released well before the pistil becomes receptive; usually {{by the time the}} pistil becomes receptive most of the pollen has either been transferred, or has lost its viability. This strategy is effective against individual flowers <b>fertilising</b> themselves, but does nothing to prevent geitonogamy: fertilisation of flowers by different flowers on the same plant. Because of the way flowers are clustered together in heads, this must be quite common, although whether it results in successful fruit set is another matter: isozyme studies have observed [...] "intense selection against homozygotes", a fairly common outbreeding strategy in plants that set lots of seed.|$|E

Historian Emery Battis, citing expert opinion, suggests that she may not have been pregnant at all during that time, but displaying acute symptoms of menopause. The following April after reuniting with her husband, she became pregnant, only to miscarry the hydatidiform mole. A woman could have suffered severe menopausal symptoms who had undergone a continuous cycle of pregnancies, deliveries, and lactations for 25years, with the burdens of raising a large family and subjected to the extreme stress of her trials.|$|E
2500|$|Considered {{the master}} shaper of the world, god {{of wisdom and}} of all magic, Enki was {{characterized}} as {{the lord of the}} Abzu (Apsu in Akkadian), the freshwater sea or groundwater located within the earth.

His grandson Enki, chosen to represent the younger gods, puts a spell on Abzu [...] "casting him into a deep sleep", thereby confining him deep underground. Enki subsequently sets up his home [...] "in the depths of the Abzu." [...] Enki thus takes on all of the functions of the Abzu, including his <b>fertilising</b> powers as lord of the waters and lord of semen.|$|E
2500|$|FOR over 20 {{years the}} work of cross-fertilising crop plants, with the object of {{producing}} New and Improved Breeds, has been carried on at Newton-le-Willows in Lancashire. It has there {{for the first time}} been demonstrated to Scientific Botanists as well as to Agriculturists that all the corn crops (cereals) and nearly all the other common crops of the farm are self <b>fertilising.</b> In other words, each individual plant provides the pollen which is required in the process of producing seed, to fertilise the female organs of its own flowers.

6000|$|It is {{impossible}} {{to look at the}} above table and doubt that the legitimate unions between the two forms of the above nine species of Primula are much more fertile than the illegitimate unions; although in the latter case pollen was always taken from a distinct plant of the same form. There is, however, no close correspondence in the two rows of figures, which give, according to the two standards, the difference of fertility between the legitimate and illegitimate unions. Thus all the flowers of P. Sinensis which were illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> by Hildebrand produced capsules; but these contained only 42 per cent of the number of seeds yielded by the legitimately <b>fertilised</b> capsules. So again, 95 per cent of the illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> flowers of P. Sikkimensis produced capsules; but these contained only 31 per cent of the number of seeds in the legitimate capsules. On the other hand, with P. elatior only 27 per cent of the illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> flowers yielded capsules; but these contained nearly 75 per cent of the legitimate number of seeds. It appears that the setting of the flowers, that is, the production of capsules whether good or bad, is not so much influenced by legitimate and illegitimate fertilisation as is the number of seeds which the capsules contain. For, as may be seen at the bottom of Table 1.12, 88.4 per cent of the illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> flowers yielded capsules; but these contained only 61.8 per cent of seeds, in comparison, in each case, with the legitimately <b>fertilised</b> flowers and capsules of the same species. There is another point which deserves notice, namely, the relative degree of infertility in the several species of the long-styled and short-styled flowers, when both are illegitimately <b>fertilised.</b> The data may be found in the earlier tables, and in those given by Mr. Scott in the Paper already referred to. If we call the number of seeds per capsule produced by the illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> long-styled flowers 100, the seeds from the illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> short- styled flowers will be represented by the following numbers (Table 1.a.):-- ...|$|R
