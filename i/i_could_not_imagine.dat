2500|$|A memo declassified in 2012 {{indicates}} that {{some in the}} Bush State Department believed that the methods were illegal under domestic and international law, and constituted war crimes. Secretary of State Colin Powell strongly opposed the invalidation of the Geneva Conventions, and U.S. Navy general counsel Alberto Mora campaigned internally against {{what he saw as}} the [...] "catastrophically poor legal reasoning" [...] of the memo. Philip D. Zelikow, former State Department adviser to Condoleezza Rice, in 2009 testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee studying the matter, [...] "It seemed to me that the OLC interpretation of U.S. Constitutional Law in this area was strained and indefensible. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> any federal court in America agreeing that the entire CIA program could be conducted and it would not violate the American Constitution." [...] Zelikow also alleged that Bush administration officials attempted to destroy his memos alleging fault in Bybee's reasoning.|$|E

60|$|I was {{surprised}} at this remark, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> why he should not believe me. However, I made no reply.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the reader may be aware that I thought John Stumpy's secrets important. Such was a fact. Try as hard as I was able, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> but <b>imagine</b> that they {{concerned}} {{my father and his}} alleged downfall.|$|R
6000|$|... "I? Why? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> but <b>imagine</b> {{that you}} must love her. Is there {{anything}} wrong in speaking of such things? Is it contrary to the American custom? I ask pardon from my heart if I have done anything amiss." ...|$|R
5000|$|Because I {{work in a}} lot of media, people can't get {{to grips}} with my work. The point is that oneself as an artist remains consistent. My object is to end up with {{something}} that I haven't seen before, to get an image which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>imagined</b> ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> {{what had}} brought him to this place at such an hour of the night. Yet I {{answered}} at once.|$|E
60|$|I {{repeated}} that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> {{why they}} had all changed towards me, or what wrong they thought I had done them.|$|E
60|$|I {{shook my}} head. Every symptom of fatal relapse. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> what card Hilda held in reserve. But I stood there, waiting.|$|E
6000|$|... "When we {{were married}} {{everyone}} felt that your position was very high. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>imagined</b> then that {{you would want to}} sell our furniture, and take a house in Bride Street, where the rooms are like cages. If we are to live in that way let us at least leave Middlemarch." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> yet <b>imagine</b> what {{he aimed}} at, {{and told him}} I granted all he had said, and thanked {{him that he would}} so far concern himself for us: and begged he would explain the {{particulars}} of what he had observed, that like Joshua, to take his own parable, I might put away the accursed thing from us.|$|R
5000|$|... “I {{had always}} thought that among my endless number of {{relatives}} I had the only queer story to tell. No matter about the one in ten statistic for {{lesbians and gay men}} (homosexuals make up at least 10 percent of the population), <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> even <b>imagine</b> there was another lesbiana in our family until the day of my grandmother’s funeral.” ...|$|R

60|$|The stranger's broad, unruffled brow, his clear, searching gaze, firm-set yet {{sensitive}} mouth, and clean-cut, resolute expression, all {{combined to}} form the most imposing and noble presence which I had ever known. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>imagined</b> that such imperturbable calm {{and at the same}} time such a consciousness of latent strength could have been expressed by any human face.|$|R
60|$|And so for {{ten minutes}} he plied me with questions, which showed me clearly that the Emperor had read him aright, {{and that he was}} determined, come what might, to be upon the side which won. We were still talking when Constant entered hurriedly, with a look of anxiety and perplexity which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>imagined</b> upon so smooth and imperturbable a face.|$|R
60|$|This story {{gave me a}} {{peculiar}} shock. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>imagined</b> that that charming and apparently light-hearted young woman at the Holly Sprig had ever been crushed down by such a sorrow as this. But I did not ask any more questions. The young girl by my side probably knew no more than she had already told me. Besides, I {{did not want to}} hear any more.|$|R
6000|$|I was {{wondering}} whether I could discreetly make Captain Butler an offer for it, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> that he set any store {{on such an}} article, when, as though he read my thoughts, he said: ...|$|E
60|$|What {{the outcome}} of the {{discovery}} would be <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine.</b> I was at the man's mercy, and I was inclined to think that, our interview of the morning would not tend to soften his feelings toward me.|$|E

"Whatever you say {{is always}} right," [...] cried Harriet, [...] "and {{therefore}} I suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>imagined</b> it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton, who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about him. He is so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses--'To Miss ------.'

40|$|Antibiotic resistance—the tip of {{the iceberg}} Access to {{effective}} antibiotics is essential in all health systems. The following quote from Charles Fletcher, a Research Fellow who in 1941 helped Howard Florey conduct the first clinical trials of penicillin, predicted the revolution of medicine brought about by penicillin and other antibiotics: “It is difficult to convey the excitement of actu-ally witnessing the amazing power of penicillin over infections for which there had previously been no effective treatment. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> then <b>imagine</b> the transformationofmedicine and sur-gery that penicillin would produce.
