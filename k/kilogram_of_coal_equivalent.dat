50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} (BOS) uses 25-35% recycled steel to {{make new}} steel. BOS steel usually contains lower concentrations of residual elements such as copper, nickel and molybdenum and is therefore more malleable than electric arc furnace (EAF) steel and {{is often used to}} make automotive fenders, tin cans, industrial drums or any product with a large degree of cold working. EAF steelmaking uses almost 100% recycled steel. This steel contains greater concentrations of residual elements that cannot be removed through the application of oxygen and lime.

The steam pressure was constantly monitored and maintained at 160 psi by a fireman or an engineer who was responsible for manually releasing steam as needed. This steam would travel from the boiler to the engines via the bulkhead, a large pipe attached to the ceiling of the bilge. Sicamous had two engines, each with a low- and high-pressure cylinder.
