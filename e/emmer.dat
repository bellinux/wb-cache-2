5|$|Agriculture was {{independently}} {{developed on}} the island of New Guinea. In Greece from c. 11,000 BC lentils, vetch, pistachios, and almonds were cultivated, while wild oats and wild barley appear in quantity from c. 7,000 BC alongside einkorn wheat, barley, sheep, goats and pigs, while <b>emmer</b> was used on Cyprus between 9,100 and 8,600 BC.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} after 9,500 BC that the eight {{so-called}} founder crops of agriculture appear: first <b>emmer</b> and einkorn wheat, then hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax. These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) sites in the Levant, although wheat {{was the first to}} be grown and harvested on a significant scale. At around the same time (9400 BC), parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated.|$|E

5|$|The Republicans won {{control of}} both houses of the {{legislature}} {{for the first time}} in decades, while Dayton narrowly defeated Republican candidate Tom <b>Emmer</b> with 44% of the vote. Many of the newly elected Republican legislators were affiliated with the Tea Party movement and had more anti-government positions than the Republican establishment. Both Dayton and Republican legislators claimed a popular mandate for their positions.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of the Ancient Greek diet was bread, and this was accompanied by goat's cheese, olives, figs, fish, and occasionally meat. The vegetables grown included onions, garlic, cabbages, melons, and lentils. In Ancient Rome, a thick porridge was made of <b>emmer</b> wheat or beans, accompanied by green vegetables but little meat, and fish was not esteemed. The Romans grew broad beans, peas, onions and turnips and ate the leaves of beets rather than their roots.|$|E
5|$|Wheat was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent, in {{and near}} the Levant some 10,000 years ago. Its {{ancestors}} include wild <b>emmer</b> wheat; this was hybridised, harvested and sown to create domestic strains with larger grains, in ears that shatter less readily than wild forms. It had been spread across the Mediterranean region as far as Spain by 5,000 BC.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota's United States {{senators}} are Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Democrat Al Franken. The {{outcome of the}} 2008 U.S. Senate election in Minnesota was contested until June 30 the next year; when the Minnesota Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} Franken, Republican Norm Coleman conceded defeat, and the vacant seat was filled by Franken. The state has eight congressional districts; they are represented by Tim Walz (1st district; DFL), Jason Lewis (2nd; R), Erik Paulsen (3rd; R), Betty McCollum (4th; DFL), Keith Ellison (5th; DFL), Tom <b>Emmer</b> (6th; R), Collin Peterson (7th; DFL), and Rick Nolan (8th; DFL).|$|E
5|$|As Reading has grown, its suburbs have spread: to {{the west}} between the two rivers into {{the foothills of the}} Berkshire Downs as far as Calcot, Tilehurst and Purley; to the south and {{south-east}} {{on the south side of}} the Kennet as far as Whitley Wood, Lower Earley and Woodley; and to the north of the Thames into the Chiltern Hills as far as Caversham Heights, <b>Emmer</b> Green and Caversham Park Village. Outside the central area, the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers remain largely unimproved floodplain. Apart from the M4 curving to the south there is only one road across the Kennet floodplain. All other routes between the three built-up areas are in the central area, which is a cause of road congestion there.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{rice and}} millet were domesticated by 8,000 BC, {{followed}} by mung, soy and azuki beans. In the Sahel region of Africa, local rice and sorghum were domesticated by 5,000 BC. Kola nut and coffee were domesticated in Africa. In New Guinea, ancient Papuan peoples began practicing agriculture around 7,000 BC, domesticating sugarcane and taro. In the Indus Valley from the eighth millennium BC onwards at Mehrgarh, 2-row and 6-row barley were cultivated, along with einkorn, <b>emmer,</b> and durum wheats, and dates. In the earliest levels of Merhgarh, wild game such as gazelle, swamp deer, blackbuck, chital, wild ass, wild goat, wild sheep, boar, and nilgai were all hunted for food. These are successively replaced by domesticated sheep, goats, and humped zebu cattle {{by the fifth}} millennium BC, indicating the gradual transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{cultivated}} <b>emmer</b> and barley, {{and several}} other cereal grains, {{all of which were}} used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer. Flax plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus growing {{on the banks of the}} Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.|$|E
5|$|The major cereal crops of {{the ancient}} Mediterranean region were wheat, <b>emmer,</b> and barley, while common {{vegetables}} included peas, beans, fava, and olives, dairy products came mostly from sheep and goats, and meat, which was consumed on rare occasion for most people, usually consisted of pork, beef, and lamb. Agriculture in ancient Greece was hindered by the topography of mainland Greece that only allowed for roughly 10% of the land to be cultivated properly, necessitating the specialized exportation of oil and wine and importation of grains from Thrace (centered {{in what is now}} Bulgaria) and the Greek colonies of southern Russia. During the Hellenistic period, the Ptolemaic Empire controlled Egypt, Cyprus, Phoenicia, and Cyrenaica, major grain-producing regions that mainland Greeks depended on for subsistence, while the Ptolemaic grain market also {{played a critical role in}} the rise of the Roman Republic. In the Seleucid Empire, Mesopotamia was a crucial area for the production of wheat, while nomadic animal husbandry was also practiced in other parts.|$|E
25|$|Most {{tetraploid}} wheats (e.g. <b>emmer</b> and durum wheat) {{are derived}} from wild <b>emmer,</b> T. dicoccoides. Wild <b>emmer</b> is itself {{the result of a}} hybridization between two diploid wild grasses, T. urartu and a wild goatgrass such as Aegilops searsii or Ae. speltoides. The unknown grass has never been identified among now surviving wild grasses, but the closest living relative is Aegilops speltoides. The hybridization that formed wild <b>emmer</b> (AABB) occurred in the wild, long before domestication, and was driven by natural selection.|$|E

25|$|<b>Emmer</b> wheat (triticum dicoccum) was {{initially}} {{the most widespread}} variety of wheat, as it grew well in the warm climate and was resistant to fungal rot. It was high yielding, with large grains and relatively high amounts of gluten, and bread made from <b>emmer</b> wheat flour was thus fairly light in texture. However, <b>emmer</b> required time-consuming pounding or roasting to remove its husk, and during the Iron Age, durum wheat (triticum durum), a descendent of <b>emmer,</b> gradually replaced <b>emmer</b> and became the favored grain for making fine flour. Durum grew well in the rich soil of the larger valleys of the central and northern areas of the country, where rainfall exceeded 225 millimeters per year, was higher yielding than <b>emmer,</b> and its grains released more easily from the chaff. It could therefore {{be separated from the}} husk without roasting or pounding first, thus reducing the work required for threshing, and also leaving most of the grains whole, which was better for longer storage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} on November 2, 2010, Dayton led his Republican opponent, Tom <b>Emmer,</b> {{at the close of}} balloting by just under 9,000 votes. The margin of victory was small enough to trigger an automatic recount under state law. Analysts generally thought it unlikely that Dayton's lead would be overturned. During the hand recount of ballots, <b>Emmer</b> failed to find enough questionable ballots to overturn Dayton's lead. <b>Emmer</b> conceded the election on December 8, 2010.|$|E
25|$|Strong {{similarities}} in morphology and genetics show that wild <b>emmer</b> (Triticum dicoccoides Koern.) is the wild ancestor and a crop wild relative of domesticated <b>emmer.</b> Because wild and domesticated <b>emmer</b> are interfertile with other tetraploid wheats, some taxonomists consider all tetraploid wheats {{to belong to}} one species, T. turgidum. Under this scheme, the two forms are recognized at subspecies level, thus T. turgidum subsp. dicoccoides and T. turgidum subsp. dicoccum. Either naming system is equally valid; the latter lays more emphasis on genetic similarities.|$|E

25|$|Wild {{species of}} barley and <b>emmer</b> wheat were domesticated and {{cultivated}} in the Jordan River Valley {{as early as}} the 9th millennium BCE. Archaeologists have found the carbonized seeds of two kinds of primitive wheat, einkorn and <b>emmer,</b> and two-rowed barley, in the earliest levels of digs at Jericho, one of the first cities in the world.|$|E

25|$|Emmer's main use is {{as a human}} food, {{though it}} is also used for animal feed. Ethnographic {{evidence}} from Turkey and other emmer-growing areas suggests that <b>emmer</b> makes good bread (judged by the taste and texture standards of traditional bread), and this is supported by evidence of its widespread consumption as bread in ancient Egypt. <b>Emmer</b> bread {{is available in the}} Netherlands and Switzerland.|$|E
