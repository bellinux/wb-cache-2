60|$|Monsieur Pouilly at {{once took}} the floor. He was a thin, dark {{man with a}} beautifully trimmed black beard, {{flashing}} black eyes, and thoughtful, delicate features. He was attired in the frock coat and dark trousers of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>usage,</b> and he appeared to somewhat resent the brown tweed suit and soft collar {{of the man who}} was receiving him.|$|E
50|$|Palazhchenko {{also wrote}} the Moi Nesistematichesky Slovar or My Unsystematic Dictionary which was {{published}} in Russia by R. Valent publications in May 2002. The 300-page Russian-English dictionary provides information, insight and cultural observation on the linguistic twists and turns that lie between the English and Russian languages; and was a sequel to Palazhchenko’s other work: the English-Russian dictionary published in 1999. The 1999 English-Russian dictionary dealt with trends in the political, <b>diplomatic</b> and journalistic <b>usage</b> in the English language.|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the current public diplomacy, especially in case of the USA in relationship towards Cuba. The aim of the thesis is to analyze the changes of USA-Cuban bilateral relations that have started to develop after restoring the <b>diplomatic</b> relations including <b>usage</b> of means of public diplomacy. The work {{is divided into three}} chapters. The first chapter provides basic characteristics of current public diplomacy, its dimensions, threats and its practice done by large states. The second chapter is dedicated to american public diplomacy, its development in the twentieth and twenty-first century and its tools that are used nowadays. The last chapter deals with public diplomacy in specific case of USA and Cuba and shortly decsribes history of their bilateral relations, from the interruption to their reestablishment. The thesis also focuses on changes that are connected to the reestablishment, involving specifically usage of tools of public diplomacy...|$|R

50|$|As sixteen Commonwealth members, {{known as}} the Commonwealth realms, share the same monarch as head of state (currently Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II), {{diplomatic}} relations between these countries are traditionally at a governmental level. In <b>diplomatic</b> <b>usage,</b> a high commissioner is considered equivalent in rank and role to an ambassador.|$|E
50|$|In <b>diplomatic</b> <b>usage,</b> {{protecting}} power {{refers to}} a relationship that is initiated when a sovereign state does not have diplomatic representation in another country. A country may, in lieu of sending its own diplomatic representative to the receiving state, appoint a third state to be its protecting power. The third state is responsible for looking after the sending state's diplomatic property {{and the interests of}} its citizens in the hosting state.|$|E
50|$|Most {{countries}} worldwide {{have some}} form of internal rank, roughly parallel to the diplomatic ranks, which are used in their foreign service or civil service in general. The correspondence is not exact, however, for various reasons, including the fact that according to <b>diplomatic</b> <b>usage,</b> all Ambassadors are of equal rank, but clearly Ambassadors of more senior rank are sent to more important postings. Some countries may make specific links or comparisons to military ranks.|$|E
50|$|Because {{members of}} the Commonwealth of Nations have or had a common head of state, they do not {{exchange}} ambassadors, but instead have High Commissioners, who represent the government, rather than the head of state. The diplomat representing the Holy See is titled a nuncio. In <b>diplomatic</b> <b>usage,</b> both the high commissioner and nuncio are considered equivalent in rank and role to an ambassador. Resident Coordinators within the United Nations system are accredited to the Head of State and have the same rank as ambassador.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>{{diplomatic}}</b> <b>usage,</b> head {{of mission}} (HOM) or chief of mission (COM) from the French [...] "chef de mission diplomatique" [...] (CMD) {{is the head of}} a diplomatic representation, such as an ambassador, high commissioner, nuncio, chargé d'affaires, permanent representative, and to a consul-general or consul. Depending on the context, it may also refer to the heads of certain international organizations' representative offices. Certain other titles or usages that would qualify as a {{head of mission}} or equivalent also exist. While they are primarily referred to by the other titles mentioned above, it is common for the diplomatic corps of several countries to use deputy head of mission or deputy chief of mission (DCM) as the primary title for the second in command of a diplomatic mission.|$|E
50|$|Although Latin is an extinct {{language}} {{with very few}} contemporary fluent speakers, it remains in use in many ways. In particular, Latin has survived through Ecclesiastical Latin, the traditional language of the Roman Catholic Church {{and one of the}} official languages of the Vatican City. Although distinct from both Classical and Vulgar Latin in a number of ways, Ecclesiastical Latin was more stable than typical Medieval Latin. More Classical sensibilities eventually re-emerged in the Renaissance with Humanist Latin. Due to both the prevalence of Christianity and the enduring influence of the Roman civilization, Latin became western Europe's lingua franca, a language used to cross international borders, such as for academic and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>usage.</b> A deep knowledge of classical Latin was a standard part of the educational curriculum in many western countries until well into the 20th century, and is still taught in many schools today. Although it was eventually supplanted in this respect by French in the 19th century and English in the 20th, Latin continues to see heavy use in religious, legal, and scientific terminology, and in academia in general.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{during this}} period there {{seems to have been}} a shift in how the word [...] "Hellene" [...] was used in Byzantine parlance. Up to this point, [...] "Hellene" [...] had borne a {{negative}} connotation and was in particular associated with the remnants of paganism. In this period, however, both the terms [...] "Graikoi" [...] and [...] "Hellenes" [...] appear to enter into the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>usage</b> of the empire as a form of religious and ethnic self-identification, spurred by a desire to differentiate the empire and its citizens from the Latins. Patriarch Germanus II of Constantinople in particular exemplifies this new vision of ethnic and religious identity. His letters equate good birth with the purity of his Hellenistic ancestry, placing more value in his Hellenistic linguistic and ethnic background than in any association with Constantinople, and showing his contempt for the Latins who prided themselves on possessing the city. There is a debate among scholars regarding the exact timing of the shift in meaning of the word Hellene. Roderick Beaton, considering the evidence of the usage of the term [...] "Hellenes" [...] in the 12th century, sees the re-evaluation of the term as occurring before the loss of Constantinople in 1204. In addition, unlike Vacalopoulos, Beaton sees not the birth of Greek nationalism, but rather an embryonic “ethnic” awareness, primarily based around language.|$|E
