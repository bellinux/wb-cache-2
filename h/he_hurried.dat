5|$|The {{final stage}} of Prus's journey took him to Paris, where he was {{prevented}} by his agoraphobia from crossing the Seine River to visit the city's southern Left Bank. He was nevertheless pleased to find that his descriptions of Paris in The Doll {{had been on the}} mark (he had based them mainly on French-language publications). From Paris <b>he</b> <b>hurried</b> home to recuperate at Nałęczów from his journey, the last that he would make abroad.|$|E
5|$|In March 1825, {{after the}} Peloponnese had been invaded by Egyptian forces, he was {{appointed}} politarch (head of public order) of Kyparissia and {{took part in the}} defence of Neokastro. After the fortress fell on 11 May 1825, <b>he</b> <b>hurried</b> to Myloi, near Nafplio, arriving with one hundred men on 10 June. He ordered the construction of makeshift fortifications, as well as the gathering of provisions. More chieftains soon arrived in Myloi and Ibrahim Pasha, the commander of the Egyptian forces, was unable to take the position, despite numerical superiority and the launching of fierce attacks on 12 and 14 June. Makriyannis was injured during the battle and was carried to Nafplio.|$|E

25|$|The {{new state}} {{constitution}} was revised, and in 1779, Rutledge was elected governor. Rutledge sent troops under General Benjamin Lincoln into Georgia to harass the British. The new British {{commander in the}} south, General Jacques Prevost, responded by marching on Charleston with 2,500 troops. When Rutledge heard about this threat, <b>he</b> <b>hurried</b> to Charleston and worked furiously to build up defenses. In spite of Rutledge’s efforts, when General Prevost arrived outside Charleston, the British force had been greatly increased {{by the addition of}} Loyalists, and the Americans were vastly outnumbered.|$|E
25|$|When Loki, the mischief-maker, {{heard of}} this, {{he made a}} magical spear from this plant (in some later versions, an arrow). <b>He</b> <b>hurried</b> {{to the place where}} the gods were indulging in their new pastime of hurling objects at Baldr, which would bounce off without harming him. Loki gave the spear to Baldr's brother, the blind god Höðr, who then {{inadvertently}} killed his brother with it (other versions suggest that Loki guided the arrow himself). For this act, Odin and the giantess Rindr gave birth to Váli who grew to adulthood within a day and slew Höðr.|$|E
25|$|Ström {{headed off}} towards Åby to inform {{them of the}} {{accident}} and met Mr. Andersson, a track walker. From a nearby house, Andersson called Åby and notified them of the accident. Track walker Eriksson arrived from his house east of the accident site. His wife had lowered the boom barrier at the railway crossing and was standing {{and waiting for the}} train when she thought it sounded as if the train had stopped, so Eriksson quickly went {{to the site of the}} derailment. Once he saw that the telegraph poles were aslant, he knew that something serious had occurred.

25|$|Stephen Báthory, {{who succeeded}} Zápolya in 1571, {{protected}} {{the interests of}} György Bocskai's orphaned children. At Báthory's request, FerdinandI's successor, Maximilian, restored to them their father's former estates in Zemplén County. The teenager Stephen Bocskai may have already moved to Maximilian's courtit is known that a son of Krisztina Sulyok was reportedly living in Vienna in 1571but {{it is certain that}} he was living in the royal court when his elder brother, Jeromos, died in 1572, because <b>he</b> <b>hurried</b> back to Kismarja from Vienna to console his mother. Initially, he served as a page in the royal court. He received a salary from 1574. He again came back to Kismarja in the summer of 1575 to see his ailing mother and to administer his estates. About a year later, he returned to Vienna where he was made a steward.|$|E
25|$|At 3:30pm two umpires {{emerged from}} the players' race leading from the {{dressing}} rooms. The crowd roared its approval. It seemed {{there was going to}} be more play. The cordon of policemen, reinforced after the spectator intrusions of the first day, respectfully made way to allow the umpires to pass. But wait! Surely Tom Brooks does not have a beard. Robin Bailhache, slight in build though he is, is slightly more substantial than the youthful beanpole figure making his way to the centre. It took Bill Watkins, the groundsman at the M.C.G. to detect the impersonation. <b>He</b> <b>hurried</b> from his post by the covers in the centre of the ground to intercept the impostors and turn them back from whence they came. In tribute to a skilful piece of improvised humour, police sergeant Brian Watkins allowed them to make good their escape, instead of conducting them to the local lock-up.|$|E
25|$|At about 14:00, the Nawab's army ceased the cannonade {{and began}} turning back north to their entrenchments, leaving St. Frais and his {{artillery}} without support. Seeing the Nawab's forces retiring, Major Kilpatrick, {{who had been}} left {{in charge of the}} British force while Clive was resting in the hunting lodge, recognised the opportunity to cannonade the retiring enemy if St. Frais' position could be captured. Sending an officer to Clive to explain his actions, he took two companies of the 39th Regiment and two field pieces and advanced towards St. Frais' position. When Clive received the message, <b>he</b> <b>hurried</b> to the detachment and reprimanded Kilpatrick for his actions without orders and commanded to bring {{up the rest of the}} army from the grove. Clive himself then led the army against St. Frais' position which was taken at 15:00 when the French artillery retreated to the redoubt of the entrenchment, setting up for further action.|$|E

25|$|Hoyos did {{not look}} any closer, but rushed to the station and took a special train to Vienna. <b>He</b> <b>hurried</b> to the Emperor's Adjutant General, Count Paar, and {{requested}} him to break the appalling news to the Emperor. The stifling protocol that characterized every movement in the Hofburg swung ponderously into action; Paar remonstrated that only the Empress could break such catastrophic news to the Emperor. Baron Nopcsa, Controller of the Empress's Household, was sent for, and he in turn sent for Countess Ida Ferenczy, Empress Elisabeth's favorite Hungarian lady-in-waiting, to determine how Her Majesty should be informed. Elisabeth was at her Greek lesson, and was impatient at the interruption. White to the lips, Ferenczy announced that Baron Nopcsa had urgent news. Elisabeth replied that he must wait and come back later. The countess insisted {{that he must be}} received immediately, finally being forced to add that there was grave news about the Crown Prince. This account comes from Ferenczy herself and Archduchess Marie Valerie, to whom Elisabeth dictated her memory of the incident, in addition to the description in her diary.|$|E
25|$|On July 2, 1863, during Gettysburg, Roebling {{was one of}} {{the initial}} {{officers}} on Little Round Top. Observing signs of Confederate troops approaching, <b>he</b> <b>hurried</b> down the hill to report to Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, for whom Roebling was aide-de-camp. General Warren and Roebling then descended the hill to find troops to secure this important tactical position. Roebling assisted in hoisting artillery up the hill, while Warren sent two of his aides, one of whom was Lt. Ranald S. Mackenzie, searching for infantry support. The two aides were able to secure a brigade from the Union V Corps. This brigade was commanded by Col. Strong Vincent whose brigade immediately occupied the hill and defended the left flank of the Army of the Potomac against repeated Confederate attacks. As Vincent's brigade began moving into position, Warren and Roebling had left the hill and Roebling was able to send the 140th New York Volunteers to the hill, not knowing that Vincent's brigade was already engaging advancing Confederate troops. However, the 140th New York provided much needed reinforcements.|$|E
25|$|When news began leaking {{that the}} three men were to be {{executed}} and a country-wide curfew would be imposed at 11:00 PM, Paglin was at a movie. After being called out and told the news, <b>he</b> <b>hurried</b> to Begin's safe house, where he was meeting with members of his high command, where doubts were being raised over the feasibility of hanging the sergeants with the British and Haganah on high alert. Paglin, {{who had not been}} allowed to venture into British-controlled areas by the high command for the previous six months, asked to take personal charge of the operation. He was convinced that the sergeants could be hanged inside the plant, and the bodies could be moved to an orange grove and hung there, since attempting to move the two alive would be too great a risk. Since the hangings were meant as a 'lesson for all to see', Irgun wanted the bodies hung up in public. That was so clear that the mayor of Tel Aviv, Yisrael Rokah, feared Irgun would hang them in the city's main square, while in Netanya it was feared that they would be hanged on local lamp posts. Begin approved Paglin's plan. Paglin then slipped {{out of the house and}} drove to Netanya in his car, where he collected four Irgun men; Benjamin Kaplan, Yoel Kimchi, Avraham Rubin, and Yosef Meller. They arrived at the diamond plant in the afternoon.|$|E

25|$|Villeneuve and {{his second}} in command, Rear-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley, hurried to ready the Toulon-based fleet for departure. Nelson had been spotted near Barcelona and Villeneuve hoped that by sailing due south from Toulon and passing east of the Balearic Islands, he might avoid the patrolling British. In reality Nelson was {{preparing}} a trap, and having {{allowed himself to be}} observed off the Spanish coast, had withdrawn to a position south of Sardinia, hoping that in attempting to avoid the supposed location of the British fleet, Villeneuve would sail straight into them. Villeneuve put to sea on 30 March, observed by the British frigates Active and , and as Nelson hoped, set course to sail between the Balearic Islands and Sardinia. The frigates lost sight of the French fleet on 1 April, the same day that Villeneuve came across a Spanish merchant, and learnt that Nelson had been sighted off Sardinia. Realising that he was sailing into an ambush, Villeneuve turned west, passing {{to the west of the}} Balearics. With no visual contact with the French, Nelson was left in the dark as to their intentions. Villeneuve pressed on to Cartegena, but did not dare wait for the Spanish ships there after they declined to join him until orders from Madrid arrived. Instead <b>he</b> <b>hurried</b> on, passing through the Strait of Gibraltar on 8 April, observed by the British squadron under Sir John Orde. From Cádiz Villeneuve collected the French 74-gun Aigle and set off across the Atlantic to the West Indies, followed by six Spanish ships of the line and a frigate under Federico Gravina.|$|E
500|$|Shelby was {{surveying}} {{lands in}} Kentucky in 1780 {{when he heard}} of the colonists' defeat at Charleston. <b>He</b> <b>hurried</b> to North Carolina, where he found a request for aid from General Charles McDowell to defend the borders of North Carolina from the British. Shelby assembled three hundred militiamen and joined McDowell at Cherokee Ford in South Carolina. On the morning of July 31, 1780, he surrounded the British stronghold at Thickety Fort on the Pacolet River with 600 men. He immediately demanded a surrender, but the British refused. Shelby brought his men within musket range and again demanded surrender. Though the fort likely would have withstood the attack, the British commander lost his nerve and capitulated. Without firing a shot, Shelby's men captured 94 prisoners.|$|E
500|$|The {{expedition}} that Borchgrevink joined was organised by Henryk Bull, a Norwegian {{businessman and}} entrepreneur who, like Borchgrevink, {{had settled in}} Australia in the late 1880s. Bull planned to make a sealing and whaling voyage into Antarctic waters; after failing to interest Melbourne's learned societies in a cost-sharing venture of a commercial–scientific nature, he returned to Norway to organise his expedition there. He met Svend Foyn, the 84-year-old [...] "father of modern whaling" [...] and inventor of the harpoon gun. With Foyn's help he acquired the whaler Kap Nor ("North Cape"), which he renamed Antarctic. Bull hired an experienced whaling captain, Leonard Kristensen, and with a crew and a small scientific team left Norway in September 1893. [...] When Borchgrevink learned that Antarctic was due to visit Melbourne in September 1894, <b>he</b> <b>hurried</b> there {{hoping to find a}} vacancy. He was fortunate; William Speirs Bruce, later an Antarctic expedition leader in his own right, had intended to join Bull's expedition as a natural scientist but could not reach the ship before it left Norway. This created an opening for Borchgrevink, who met Bull in Melbourne and persuaded him to take him on as a deck-hand and part-time scientist.|$|E

500|$|When Washington {{learned that}} Howe's fleet was sailing north in Chesapeake Bay, <b>he</b> <b>hurried</b> his army south of Philadelphia {{to defend the}} city against Howe's threat. [...] General Howe turned Washington's flank at the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, and marched unopposed into Philadelphia on September 26 after some further maneuvers. [...] Washington's failure to defend the capital brought on a storm of {{criticism}} from Congress, which fled the city for York, and from other army officers. [...] In part to silence his critics, Washington planned an elaborate assault on an exposed British base in Germantown. [...] The October 4 Battle of Germantown failed {{in part due to}} the complexity of the assault, and the inexperience of the militia forces employed in it. Over 400 of Washington's men were captured, including Colonel George Mathews and the entire 9th Virginia Regiment. It did not help that Adam Stephen, leading one of the branches of the attack, was drunk, and broke from the agreed-upon plan of attack. [...] He was court martialed and cashiered from the army. [...] Historian Robert Leckie observes that the battle was a near thing, and that a small number of changes might have resulted in a decisive victory for Washington.|$|E

[...] According to his confession, the meeting {{took place at the}} home of Tresham's brother-in-law, Lord Stourton, in Clerkenwell. [...] Tresham claimed to have questioned Catesby on the morality of the plot, asking if it was spiritually [...] "damnable". [...] Catesby replied that it was not, at which point Tresham highlighted the danger that all Catholics would face should the plot succeed. [...] Catesby replied, [...] "The necessity of the Catholics" [...] was such that [...] "it must needs be done". [...] He wanted two things from Tresham: £2,000, and the use of Rushton Hall; Catesby received neither. [...] Tresham had no money to spare, his father's debts having reduced his inheritance, although he paid a small sum to Thomas Wintour, on the understanding that the latter was to travel to the Low Countries. [...] Following the meeting, <b>he</b> <b>hurried</b> back to Rushton Hall and closed his household, taking care to hide family papers (not discovered until 1838).
