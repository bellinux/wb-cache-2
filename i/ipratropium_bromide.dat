40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{evaluated}} the pharmacological profile of the muscarinic antagonist glycopyrrolate in guinea-pig and human airways {{in comparison with the}} commonly used antagonist <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> Glycopyrrolate and <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> inhibited EFS-induced contraction of guinea-pig trachea and human airways in a concentration-dependent manner. Glycopyrrolate was more potent than <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> The onset of action (time to attainment of 50 % of maximum response) of glycopyrrolate was similar to that obtained with <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> in both preparations. In guinea-pig trachea, the offset of action (time taken for response to return to 50 % recovery after wash out of the test antagonist) for glycopyrrolate (t 1 / 2 [offset]= 26. 4 ± 0. 5 [*]min) was less than that obtained with <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (81. 2 ± 3. 7 [*]min). In human airways, however, the duration of action of glycopyrrolate (t 1 / 2 [offset]> 96 [*]min) was significantly more prolonged compared to <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (t 1 / 2 [offset]= 59. 2 ± 17. 8 [*]min). In competition studies, glycopyrrolate and <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> bind human peripheral lung and human airway smooth muscle (HASM) muscarinic receptors with affinities in the nanomolar range (Ki values 0. 5 – 3. 6 [*]nM). Similar to <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> glycopyrrolate showed no selectivity in its binding to the M 1 –M 3 receptors. Kinetics studies, however, showed that glycopyrrolate dissociates slowly from HASM muscarinic receptors (60 % protection against [3 H]-NMS binding at 30 [*]nM) compared to <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> These results suggest that glycopyrrolate bind human and guinea-pig airway muscarinic receptors with high affinity.

40|$|Purpose: We {{present a}} case {{report of a}} 44 -year old female patient with {{complicated}} pneumonia who developed anisocoria after treatment with inhaled <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> Discontinuation of <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> treatment led to complete resolution of anisocoria. Observation: A 44 -year old female patient {{was admitted to the}} Department of Pulmonology due to high body temperature (40. 0  °C), coughing and general weakness. After a general examination and tests the patient was diagnosed with right-sided pneumonia. Since spirometry test showed signs of bronchial obstruction, pulmonologist indicated inhalation therapy with <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> Soon after <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> therapy was initiated, the patient noticed enlarged left pupil and stated that some aerosol reached her left eye during the inhalation therapy. After consulting neurology and monitoring neurological signs, <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> treatment was discontinued. Twenty-four hours after discontinuing the <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> treatment anisocoria was completely resolved. Conclusions and importance: Presence of anisocoria may be a concerning neurological sign. If there are no other neurological or ophthalmological signs and symptoms and a recent <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> inhalation treatment exists in the patient's history, we should consider iatrogenic side-effect of drugs as a possible reason of anisocoria and possibly spare the patient extensive and invasive diagnostic procedures that can also raise costs of treatment significantly.

40|$|SummaryA new {{anticholinergic}} aerosol containing 0. 5 mg <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> {{dissolved in}} 1 mL of solution has been produced {{with the purpose}} of decreasing nebulization time for patients compared to the traditional formulation which is twice as voluminal (0. 5 mg/ 2 mL, Boehringer-Ingelheim, France). The aim {{of this study was to}} compare aerosol characteristics (inhaled mass, particle size distribution and nebulization time) of these two formulations of <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> nebulized alone and with terbutaline (5 mg/ 2 mL, Astra Zeneca, Sweden), to determine whether the new formulation was equivalent to the old one. Four different jet nebulizers were used: PariLC+®, Atomisor NL 9 M®, Sidestream® and Mistyneb®. Statistical analysis of the results showed that for all types of nebulizer, the inhaled mass of <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> 0. 5 mg/ 1 mL was significantly lower than the inhaled mass of <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> 0. 5 mg/ 2 mL, and that there was no statistical difference between the inhaled mass of <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> 0. 5 mg/ 1 mL+terbutaline 5 mg/ 2 mL and the inhaled mass of <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> 0. 5 mg/ 2 mL+terbutaline 5 mg/ 2 mL. The study also showed that the new formulation of <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (0. 5 mg/ 1 mL) mixed with terbutaline allowed a 26 % decrease in nebulization time compared to the old formulation (0. 5 mg/ 2 mL) mixed with terbutaline without changing aerosol characteristics (inhaled mass and particle size distribution). This leads to the conclusion that a 2 mL minimum volume is required for nebulization, and that nebulization of <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> 0. 5 mg/ 1 mL alone must be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Background Indonesian {{guidelines}} for childhood asthma recom- mend giving <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> {{when there are}} no improvement after 2 times salbutamol nebulization. The efficacy and safety of early nebulization of <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> combined with salbutamol as first line in moderate asthma exacerbation in children are still unknown. Objective To compare efficacy and safety between nebulized salbutamol-ipratropium bromide and salbutamol alone in children with moderate asthma exacerbation. Methods Fifty-two children (2 - 6 years) with acute asthma (clinical score 5 - 10) were enrolled into a randomized single blind controlled trial comparing 2 groups of 2. 5 mg nebulized salbutamol (group 1) and 2. 5 mg salbutamol combined with 0. 5 mg <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (group 2). Nebulization was given until clinical score decreased 0. 05). There were no toxic effects attributable to <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> and the side effects were not different between these two groups.

40|$|The {{paradoxical}} bronchoconstriction {{observed with}} commercially available isotonic <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> nebuliser solution (Atrovent) {{in patients with}} asthma results from an adverse reaction to the preservatives, benzalkonium chloride and ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA). The airway response to inhaled Atrovent and preservative free <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> nebuliser solutions has been examined in a double blind study. On separate occasions 30 asthmatic subjects inhaled 2 ml of the solutions and airway calibre was {{measured in terms of}} FEV 1 for 45 minutes. Atrovent nebuliser solution provoked a greater than 20 % fall in FEV 1 in five of the 30 subjects, whereas this did not occur after preservative free <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> Inhalation of the preservative free solution resulted in more rapid and greater overall bronchodilatation than Atrovent, with mean maximum increases in FEV 1 of 29. 2 % and 18. 5 % respectively. It is concluded that the risk of paradoxical bronchoconstriction with <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> is considerably reduced by removal of benzalkonium chloride and EDTA and that preservative free <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> is a more potent bronchodilator than the currently available Atrovent solution...|$|E
40|$|The bronchodilating {{responses}} to 400 micrograms salbutamol and 80 micrograms <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> were studied in 188 {{patients with chronic}} bronchitis (n = 113) or asthma (n = 75) and mild to moderate airflow obstruction (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) above 50 % but below 2 SD of predicted value) in a crossover study on {{two days a week}} apart. Both the patients with asthma and the patients with chronic bronchitis varied considerably in their {{responses to}} the salbutamol and the <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> The mean increase in FEV 1 in the subjects with asthma was higher after salbutamol (0. 371 or 18 % of the prebronchodilator value) than after <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (0. 26 1 or 13 %). In chronic bronchitis {{there was no difference between}} the increase in FEV 1 after salbutamol (0. 161 or 7 %) and after <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (0. 191 or 8 %). When patients were categorised into those with a better response to salbutamol 400 micrograms and those with a better response to <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> 80 micrograms, patients with chronic bronchitis responded better in general to <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> whereas asthmatic patients responded better to salbutamol. The response pattern was also related to allergy and age, allergic patients and patients under 60 being more likely to respond better to salbutamol 400 micrograms than non-allergic patients and older patients, who benefited more from <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> 80 micrograms. The response pattern was not related to sex, smoking habits, lung function, bronchial reactivity, respiratory symptoms, or number of exacerbations during the preceding year...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> {{was given}} to {{patients}} admitted to hospital with acute asthma. A cumulative-dose-response technique in six patients showed that 500 micrograms given by nebuliser produced a maximal increase in peak expiratory flow rate. This dose of <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> was included in a regimen {{in which it was}} given either two hours before or two hours after nebulised salbutamol to 22 patients. <b>Ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> given on admission was as effective as nebulised salbutamol. The two drugs in sequence produced greater bronchodilatation than either used alone, and the mean peak expiratory flow rate rose by 96 % in four hours. Thus giving <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> in addition to salbutamol in severe asthma enhances the bronchodilator effect. Further studies are needed to determine whether the same effect may be obtained by giving two maximal doses of salbutamol two hours apart...|$|E

40|$|In {{thirteen}} {{patients with}} extrinsic asthma {{the effects of}} placebo, sodium cromoglycate, <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> and <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> plus sodium cromoglycate were studied in a random double-blind fashion to assess their inhibitory action in exercise-induced asthma (EIA). Exercise testing consisted of steady state running on an inclined treadmill for up to eight minutes. In eight of the 13 patients studied the baseline ratio of expiratory flow at 50 % vital capacity (VC) breathing helium-oxygen (V 50 He) to V 50 air was over 1. 20 and they were called responders; the remaining five patients were called non-responders. There was a significantly lower baseline maximum mid-expiratory flow rate (MMEF) in non-responders (P less than 0. 02) as compared to responders but no difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) or forced vital capacity (FVC). Sodium cromoglycate (P less than 0. 02), <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (P less than 0. 01), and <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> plus spdium cromoglycate (P less than 0. 01) all significantly inhibited the percentage fall in FEV 1 after exercise in the responders. <b>Ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> had no preventive action on non-responders, unlike sodium cromoglycate (P less than 0. 05) and <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> plus sodium cromoglycate (P less than 0. 02).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although the bronchodilating {{effect of}} inhaled anticholinergics has been {{established}} in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), their effects on exercise capacity are still controversial. Previous studies have suggested that the standard dosage hardly affects exercise tolerance, whereas higher doses might elicit an improvement. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the dose of <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> aerosol that improves exercise performance using progressive cycle ergometry in patients with stable COPD. METHODS: Twenty men with stable COPD of mean (SD) age 69. 2 (4. 6) years and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 1. 00 (0. 37) 1 were studied in a randomised double blind manner. Each patient received <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> in doses of 240 micrograms, 160 micrograms, 80 micrograms, 40 micrograms, and placebo from a metered dose inhaler (MDI) with an InspirEase spacer on five separate days. Spirometric parameters were assessed before and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after each inhalation, and pulse rate and blood pressure were also measured immediately before each spirometric measurement. Symptom limited progressive (20 watts/min) cycle ergometer exercise tests were performed 90 minutes after each inhalation. RESULTS: <b>Ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> in doses of 160 micrograms and 240 micrograms produced a greater increase in FEV 1 than 40 micrograms or 80 micrograms <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> at all time points. Doses of 160 micrograms and 240 micrograms <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> also produced greater increases in maximal work load and maximal oxygen consumption than placebo, whereas 40 micrograms and 80 micrograms <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> did not. There was a weak correlation between the change in FEV 1 and the change in maximal work load (r = 0. 45). No differences were found in pulse rate or blood pressure between the treatment and placebo groups, and no side effects were noted throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: A dose of at least four times the standard dose of <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> from an MDI with a spacer device was necessary to improve maximal cycle exercise capacity in patients with stable COPD. Although the data from cycle ergometry cannot be directly applied to exercise performed during day to day activities, it is conceivable that the recommended doses of <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> do not elicit the optimal clinical benefits...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{inhalation}} of <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> was evaluated in 20 patients with bronchial asthma.

Since PEFR is a measure of large airway function and cholinergic mechanisms are primarily involved for airflow obstruction at large airways, improvement in PEFR by <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> highlights its role as a useful bronchodilator in patients in whom vagal reflexes are responsible for the provocation of bronchoconstriction...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Patients {{admitted}} {{with acute}} exacerbation of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) are often prescribed <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> {{in combination with}} a beta 2 agonist such as salbutamol.

Combination therapy with the two drugs was compared with salbutamol alone in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD during a hospital admission. METHODS [...] Seventy patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD were randomly allocated to receive either nebulised salbutamol 5 mg and <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> 500 micrograms, or nebulised salbutamol 5 mg alone (all four times a day) on admission. All other treatment was prescribed at the discretion of the attending physician. Length of stay in hospital and spirometric values on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and discharge were assessed. Patients completed a subjective symptom score each day. RESULTS [...] There was no {{difference between the two groups}} in the mean (SD) length of stay (salbutamol 10. 5 (4. 7) days, salbutamol + <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> 11. 8 (4. 4) days; 95 % CI - 1. 02 to 3. 62). There was no difference in spirometric values on days 1, 3, 7, 14, or discharge between the two groups. The subjective improvement was similar with both treatments. CONCLUSIONS [...] The routine addition of nebulised <b>ipratropium</b> <b>bromide</b> to salbutamol appears to be of no benefit in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD...|$|E
