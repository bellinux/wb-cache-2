5|$|A high {{pressure}} system over the central United States drifted east {{and added a}} westward component to Gordon's southward motion, pulling the storm southwest towards Florida. The persistent shear and a continued lack of deep convection eventually reduced the storm's winds to below tropical storm force, and on the morning on November 20 Gordon became a tropical depression. The {{high pressure}} system over the continent continued pulling the depression towards the west until <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>its</b> final landfall near Cape Canaveral that night with winds of 30 mph (45 km/h). Between its three Floridian landfalls, Hurricane Gordon dumped 5–10 in (13–25 cm) of rain on Florida, with a station at Cooperstown recording 16.1 in (40.9 cm). The storm moved northward across Florida, northeastward across Georgia, and finally merged with a frontal system over South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Around 06:00UTC, Bopha passed 100km (65mi) {{south of}} Babeldaob island in Palau while at its initial peak. Shortly {{thereafter}} <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>its</b> closest approach the nation, tracking roughly 55km (35mi) south of Angaur island. After clearing Palau, Bopha ultimately intensified further {{before making a}} devastating landfall on Mindanao in the Philippines. The JTWC estimated its peak intensity at 280km/h (175mph), a Category5 on the SSHWS. The storm resulted in up to 1,901fatalities {{in the country and}} tremendous infrastructural damage. Land interaction substantially weakened the system by the time it emerged over the Sulu Sea. Turning north, Bopha briefly weakened to a tropical storm on December6 before undergoing another period of rapid intensification. After reaching its tertiary peak on December7, hostile wind shear caused dramatic weakening. In a 24‑hour span, the typhoon's central pressure rose by 55mbar (hPa; 1.62inHg) while its winds fell from 170km/h (105mph) to 75km/h (45mph). Bopha soon degraded to a tropical depression and dissipated off the northwestern coast of Luzon early on December9.|$|E
