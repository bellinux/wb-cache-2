50|$|The International Tribunal on the Crimes Against Women {{was planned}} as an event for IWY {{but was not}} held until 4 to 8 March 1976 in Brussels, Belgium.

40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s an <b>international</b> <b>feminist</b> <b>network,</b> Gender at Work, {{wrote about the}} ‘deep structure’ of organisations through which gender discriminatory norms and power {{relations}} are reproduced. In this article, the authors reflect on the evolution since the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995 of Gender at Work's theory and practice on approaches to shift deep structure. The Gender at Work Analytical Framework, used by dozens of organisations worldwide to assess, strategise and evaluate the process of organisational change, is described. Using a case study on the Dalit Women's Livelihood Accountability Initiative in Uttar Pradesh, India, the article demonstrates the adaptation of the Analytical Framework for working directly with community?level programmes, highlighting its strength at bringing into focus the deeply entrenched social norms and deep structures that exclude women from claiming their rights. The article concludes with reflections on what Gender at Work has learned since Beijing about working to challenge deep structures in organisations, programmes and systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} a socio-historic {{case study of}} the <b>Feminist</b> <b>International</b> <b>Network</b> of Resistance to Reproductive and Genetic Engineering (FINRRAGE) in order to {{consider}} {{the ways in which}} activists create and develop knowledge in movements around complex emergent technologies. Using documentary and interview data, and an analytic framework drawn from Eyerman and Jamison's cognitive praxis paradigm, the paper outlines certain conditions under which activists may be able to create both social and social scientific knowledge in support of their claims. The paradigm itself is also interrogated, and suggestions made for extending and refining the framework through incorporation of theories of knowledge drawn from science and technology studies...|$|R
40|$|Family {{planning}} {{has been}} a major preoccupation of development agencies in South Asia for several decades now. However, the way family planning programs have been implemented and are still being aggressively promoted in different parts of South Asia causes problems for, rather than furthering, women's reproductive rights and women's health. The priorities of development agencies reflect Western obsessions with limiting population rather than the actual needs of local women. These issues have been taken up and promoted by local groups such as UBINIO in Bangladesh, as well as by <b>international</b> <b>feminist</b> organizations such as FINRRAGE (<b>Feminist</b> <b>International</b> <b>Network</b> of Resistance to Reproductive and Genetic Engineering), allied to the growing international concern with medical abuse of women's bodies. There are however problems with the strategies of these movements. While their opposition to the forms of contraception which are currently being promoted is entirely justified, they have little to offer in their place. Their mostly educated, middle-class memberships tend to have little empathy with, or understanding of, the situation of village women. In examining the problematic relationships between urban feminist groups in developing countries, Western feminist organizations, and the rural populations whom they seek to aid, this paper hopes to contribute towards a feminist politics more attuned to the reality of rural women in South Asia and similar contexts...|$|R
40|$|As {{surrogacy}} services expand globally, {{more and}} more nations are moving to ban the practice. Calls for its abolition couched in feminist terms returned to prominence in international public life in 2012. The resurgence follows a lapse since {{the heyday of the}} <b>Feminist</b> <b>International</b> <b>Network</b> of Resistance to Reproductive and Genetic Engineering (FINRRAGE) in the 1980 s. In their moral opposition to prostitution (conflated with slavery) and cyborg human embodiment (which critics term “medical abuse”), the agendas of such feminisms and Christian conservatism overlap. This raises the question, what is the enemy against which childbearing is to be defended? This article analyzes the Euro-American and Australian anglophone feminist-abolitionist stance toward surrogacy, contextualizing it in relation to sex-worker-exclusionary antitrafficking, on the one hand, and transphobic imaginaries, on the other. These truncated abolitionisms, I argue, perform opposition to commodification rather than capitalism and encrypt profoundly antifeminist ideas under the guise of fighting patriarchy. Where reproductive assistance is concerned, justice is ultimately hindered rather than advanced by such technophobic body politics...|$|R

40|$|While {{literature}} {{examining the}} significance of age and generation in transnational social movements continues to grow, few studies focus specifically on young women and their involvement with global feminism. Making the empirical observation that “young women‟s ” transnational <b>feminist</b> <b>networks</b> have emerged and gained more visibility in the last decade, this dissertation investigates their existence, asking why young women identifying {{as part of a}} “transnational feminist class ” form youth-only networks rather than joining – or maintaining membership within – existing and established networks. Data was collected from five young women‟s transnational <b>feminist</b> <b>networks</b> using qualitative methods, including semi-structured interview, participant observation and triangulated digital writing analysis. Analysis of this data yielded several findings. First, young women are likely to form “youth-only ” <b>feminist</b> <b>networks</b> in three circumstances: 1) when they feel under- and misrepresented within the discursive and political forums of global feminism; 2) when they feel the education they need to further their goals and establish their identities as activists is inadequate; and 3) when they find generation gaps create perceived irreconcilable “differences ” of tactical and organizational preferenc...|$|R
