Fans vote by either handing a voting form to the club or by <b>e-mailing</b> the club. As a mark of respect, the trophy is named the Billy Fenton Memorial Trophy, after player Billy Fenton, who died suddenly in 1973. The award is presented before the final home match of the season by Fenton's widow, Margot Fenton. However, the presentation of the award took place at an awards night in 2011, while the following year it was presented after the final home game of the season. From 2014 to 2015, an awards night was held at York Racecourse to present the award. In 2016, the award was presented before the final home match of the season.|$|E

40|$|The {{explosive}} {{increase in}} the use of <b>e-mails</b> has produced a large amount of information, and caused a problem in that many spam or regular <b>e-mails</b> with the same or similar contents are duplicated over and over day-to-day.

40|$|Two {{server-side}} <b>e-mail</b> service {{strategies that}} utilize a layer- 3 <b>e-mail</b> classification technique are presented. Based on layer- 3 classification scores, {{the class of}} an <b>e-mail</b> can be estimated with minimal processing during normal reassembly on <b>e-mail</b> servers with a high accuracy. Non-spam <b>e-mails</b> are queued in a fast queue, whereas spam <b>e-mails</b> are queued in a slower queue. The non-spam queue is served with higher service capacity than the spam one. Two <b>e-mail</b> service strategies are analyzed using a priority queue model. The first service strategy assigns fixed service capacities to both queues. The second service strategy serves the spam queue based on the occupancies of both queues. We model these two strategies using discrete-time Markov chain analysis. The behavior and performance of the proposed service strategies are analyzed under different <b>e-mail</b> traffic loads. Our models show that non-spam <b>e-mails</b> can be delivered under small delay, {{as compared to the}} current strategy that uses a single queue approach. The proposed strategies exhibit delay and loss probability orders of magnitude smaller than the ones for the single queue approach, even under heavy <b>e-mail</b> loading and high spam to non-spam prior. Servicing <b>e-mails</b> by predicting an <b>e-mail's</b> class has two-fold advantages. First speeding up non-spam <b>e-mail</b> services and delivery at the expense of longer spam queuing delay, and second protecting <b>e-mail</b> servers in the events of spam attacks and high <b>e-mail</b> traffic...|$|R

We show that this deviation is caused by the unsocial behavior of unsolicited <b>e-mail</b> traffic. We also analyze how various structural properties of <b>e-mail</b> networks change over time and reveal the structural properties that are indicative of the unsocial behavior of spam traffic. Finally, we show that our findings can be used to identify spam traffic in regular <b>e-mail</b> traffic without inspecting the <b>e-mail</b> contents...|$|R

[...] Hurd said that [...] "requel", a portmanteau of [...] "reboot" [...] and [...] "sequel", was a [...] "perfect" [...] description for the film. Norton explained his decision to ignore Lee's origin story: [...] "I don't even like the phrase 'origin story', and I don't think in great literature and great films that explaining the roots of the story doesn't mean it comes in the beginning." [...] "Audiences know this story," [...] he added, [...] " [...] deal with it artfully." [...] He wanted to [...] "have revelations even in the third act about what set this whole thing in motion". The new origin story references Ultimate Marvel's take on the Hulk, which also had him created in an attempt to make super soldiers. Norton removed Rick Jones and toned down S.H.I.E.L.D.'s presence. He also added the scene where Banner attempts to extract a cure from a flower and his <b>e-mailing</b> with Samuel Sterns, which references Bruce Jones' story. Norton rewrote scenes every day. Ultimately, the Writers Guild of America decided to credit the script solely to Penn, who argued Norton had not dramatically changed his script. Journalist Anne Thompson explained [...] "The Guild tends to favor plot, structure and pre-existing characters over dialogue." [...] Penn said in 2008, [...] "I wasn't happy with [...] coming to Comic-Con saying that he wrote the script." [...] Before either Penn and Norton joined the project, an anonymous screenwriter wrote a draft and lobbied for credit.|$|E
