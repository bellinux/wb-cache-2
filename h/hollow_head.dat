40|$|The Tama Hills, {{located in}} {{the western edge of}} the Kanto Plain, are mainly {{composed}} of semi- or unconsoidated shallow marine sediments of Plio-Pleistocene age, which, named the Kazusa Group, consist of several clay-silt, sand and gravel beds, On the hilltop gentle slopes in the western part of the Tama Hills, the mid-Pleistocene Gotentoge Gravel Bed rests unconformably upon the Kazusa Group. And the Hills are covered with airborne tephras named the Kanto Loam. The lower part of the Kanto Loam is full-weathered and rich in clay. The purpose of the present study is to clarify the distribution and formation of detailed- to micro-scale landforms composing small tributary basins, in connection with the hydro-geologic conditions in the western part of the Tama Hills. In valley-head areas, <b>head</b> <b>hollow</b> and <b>head</b> floor defined by Tamura(1974) are distributed and their location seems to be controlled by the hydro-geologic conditions. The maximum height of each <b>head</b> <b>hollow</b> and the position of springlet correspond well to the height of bedding plane of clay-silt bed in the Kazusa Group or the lower part of the Kanto Loam, both of which have less permiability. Head floor develops on the surface of less-permeable beds. Because of the less permiability, surface and sub-surface flow often occurs and marsh is sometimes formed on this slope unit. Locations of valley-head slopes on the hillsides are also affected by the distribution of lesspermeable beds. Here the development of the slopes seems to have been initiated by the landslides. Present <b>head</b> <b>hollows</b> were formed by slide-type failure. Each mass movement occurs along the bedding plane upon the less-permeable beds. Valley-head slopes are considered to have been formed by surface failures occurred during heavy storms. In addition to the occurrence of pipeflow and returnflow which are also related to hydro-geologic condiions, groundwater itself seems to pllay an important role in landforming process accompanied by surface failure. It is concluded that the distribution and formation of slope units in the Tama Hills are strongly controlled by the hydro-geologic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Background Salivary gland {{scintigraphy}} gives functional {{information on}} irradiated glands. Upon irradiation, their size may become less than 2 – 3 times {{the resolution of}} the gamma camera hence underestimation of the regional distribution of administered activity due to partial volume effects (PVEs) which hinder accurate quantification of their function. Aim To accurately quantify planar images of spheres mimicking irradiated parotid and submandibular glands with view of implementing salivary gland scintigraphy that involves quantification of PVEs. Methods A <b>hollow</b> <b>head</b> and neck phantom was fitted with spheres (diameters: 20 mm; 14 mm; 12 mm and 10 mm) filled with technetium- 99 m solution of activity concentration of 300 kBq/mL. The spheres mimicked irradiated parotid glands (right (RP) and left (LP)) and submandibular glands (right (RSM) and left (LSM)) respectively. The phantom was filled with technetium- 99 m solution of activity concentration 144 kBq/mL. 1 A planar image was acquired in 5 minutes using Siemens E-Cam dual head gamma camera detector positioned 5 cm vertically above the phantom, on 128 × 128 matrix size following a thyroid protocol. The detector was fitted with low energy high resolution collimators. ImageJ software was used for quantification. Results The image counts post PVEs quantification were: LP= 252, 690; LP= 160, 836; RSM= 149, 315; LSM= 68, 292. The percentage quantification errors were: 44 per cent, 48 per cent, 51 per cent and 75 per cent for the LP, RP, RSM and LSM glands respectively. Conclusion ImageJ software improved quantitative accuracy of sphere images hence it provides a robust quantification tool for irradiated salivary glands...|$|E

E. do Buriti, atravÃs da anÃlise de palinomorfos de uma turfeira, caracterizaÃÃo das formaÃÃes superficiais e dataÃÃo pelo mÃtodo do 14 C. Ao longo de um testemunho de 130 cm, foram identificados 37 tÃxons diferentes, os quais foram separados em cinco categorias ecolÃgicas (Ãrvores, arbustos, ervas terrestres, algas e esporos de pteridÃfitas). A dataÃÃo estimada sugere que a base da turfeira formou-se Ã aproximadamente 13. 700 anos A. P, perÃodo relacionado ao Ãltimo MÃximo Glacial (UMG). Nessa Ãpoca a cabeceira de drenagem nÃo teria uma ligaÃÃo canalizada com a rede de drenagem do rio IndependÃncia, nÃvel de base local. De acordo com os dados obtidos, pode-se afirmar que na regiÃo da Ãrea de estudo, durante a passagem do Pleistoceno/Holoceno atÃ o presente, nÃo hÃ registros de cerrado, apenas de Ãreas campestres no Pleistoceno, inferido pela presenÃa de ervas terrestres, principalmente Asteraceae e Borreria encontrados em 12. 700 anos A. P. (est.) e total ausÃncia de algas e grÃos de pÃlen de espÃcies arbÃreas, sugerindo regime hidrolÃgico mais seco. Eventualmente, fenÃmenos de alta precipitaÃÃo ocorreram nas encostas e promoveram a degradaÃÃo dos horizontes de solo na alta encosta (nose), promovendo a deposiÃÃo de camadas coluviais atÃ o novo regime hÃdrico, mais Ãmido, propiciando a instalaÃÃo de uma vegetaÃÃo herbÃcea acompanhada de pteridÃfitas, principalmente nas Ãreas mais baixas. HÃ cerca de 10. 600 anos A. P. 14 C (est.), a manutenÃÃo da elevaÃÃo de umidade se estabelece e altos Ãndices de precipitaÃÃo fizeram com que o lenÃol freÃtico aflorasse no hollow constantemente, acelerando a hidromorfizaÃÃo do paleohorizonte A hÃmico e desenvolvendo, nas estaÃÃes chuvosas, uma pequena lagoa no eixo central da cabeceira. Fato evidenciado pela presenÃa de algas e por uma expansÃo significativa de Araucaria angustifolia, a qual necessita de um regime pluviomÃtrico {{superior}} a 1. 400 mm. ano- 1, sem estaÃÃo seca definida. A vegetaÃÃo predominante passa a ser de Floresta OmbrÃfila Mista e Floresta Pluvial AtlÃntica composta por gÃneros arbÃreos, ervas terrestres e pteridÃfitas. A mÃxima expansÃo da Floresta OmbrÃfila Mista Ã registrada a cerca de 6. 880 anos A. P. (est.), face o aumento de todos os tÃxons registrados, principalmente Araucaria. A presenÃa de algas ficou mais acentuada, sugerindo novamente a ocorrÃncia de uma lÃmina de Ãgua, conservada por um regime pluviomÃtrico abundante e regular. Nos anos que se seguiram, provavelmente Ã 1. 060 anos A. P. (est.), ocorreu uma reduÃÃo da vegetaÃÃo de modo generalizado, modificando-se apenas no presente com o plantio de araucÃrias apÃs a criaÃÃo da A. R. I. E. do Buriti. Em algum momento desse perÃodo o hollow da cabeceira de drenagem passou a desenvolver canais de drenagem perenes, que permitiram a drenagem eficiente na cabeceira, diminuindo os nÃveis de umidade da turfeiraThis study identifies paleoenvironmental {{records in}} the remaining at planed surface VIII, in Pato Branco (SW PR), more precisely in conservation area (A. R. I. E. do Buriti) by analysis of palynomorphs in a bog, characterization of the surface formations and the 14 C dating method. Throughout the testimony of 130 cm, 37 different taxa were identified, which were separated into five ecological categories (trees, shrubs, ground herbs, algae and fern spores). The dating estimated suggests that {{the base of the}} bog was formed approximately 13, 700 years BP, a period related to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). At that time the head of drainage would not have a connection to the piped drainage waterway of Independence river, local base level. According to the data obtained, we can affirm that in the region of the study area during the transition from the Pleistocene / Holocene to the present, there are no records of savannah, only grassland areas in the Pleistocene, inferred by the presence of ground herbs, especially Borreria and Asteraceae found in 12, 700 years BP 14 C (estimated) and total absence of algae and pollen grains of tree species, suggesting drier hydrological regime. Occasionally, high precipitation phenomeno occurred on the slopes and promoted the degradation of soil horizons in the upper slope (nose), promoting the deposition of colluvial layers until the new water regime, wetter, allowing the establishment of a herbaceous vegetation accompanied by ferns, mainly in the lower areas. In about 10, 600 years BP 14 C (est.), maintenance of high humidity is established and high precipitation caused the water table surface in the hollow constantly accelerating the hidromorfization paleohorizonte A humic, and developing in the rainy seasons, a small pond in the central axis of the headboard. Fact evidenced by the presence of algae and a significant expansion of Araucaria angustifolia, which requires an annual rainfall exceeding 1, 400 mm. yr- 1, without a dry season. The predominant vegetation is replaced by the Araucaria Forest and Atlantic Rain Forest composed of genres trees, ground herbs and ferns. The maximum expansion of the Araucaria Forest is logged about 6, 880 years BP 14 C (est.), face the increase of all taxa recorded, mainly from Araucaria. The presence of algae was more pronounced, again suggesting the occurrence of a blade of water conserved by an abundant and regular rainfall. In the years that followed, probably to 1, 060 years BP 14 C (est.), a reduction of vegetation as a general rule, changing only in the present with the planting of araucaria after the creation of A.
