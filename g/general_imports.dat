30|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects that the {{increase}} in the importation of machinery parts and components and the changes in the supplier composition had in the trade of final products and parts and components inside Latin America. In our analysis, we consider these effects according to two dimensions: a quantity one that captures whether there was an intensification of trade and a quality one that captures changes in the sophistication of the traded goods. The research employs disaggregated trade data obtained from UN Comtrade for 17 Latin American countries between 1996 and 2011. We find evidence that an increase in the importation of parts and components from Latin America had positive impacts on both the quantity and quality dimensions. Subregional heterogeneities revealed that, in <b>general,</b> <b>imports</b> from East Asia had positive effects on the quantity dimension, nurturing the expansion of machinery production networks inside Latin America, and on the quality dimension, increasing the sophistication of the products traded inside Latin America, especially for Mercosur member exports. Imports from North America had positive quantity effects, especially for exports of countries from the Andean Community, Central America, Chile, and Mexico.|$|E
40|$|U. S. {{live cattle}} and beef trade has {{increased}} substantially since the mid- 1980 s. Total beef imports (cattle and beef, dressed weight) increased from 2. 51 billion pounds in 1985 to 3. 89 billion pounds in 1998. Total beef exports (cattle and beef, dressed weight) increased from 0. 42 billion pounds to 2. 38 billion pounds {{over the same}} period. Consequently, net imports declined by 0. 58 billion pounds. On a value basis, U. S. net beef exports (value of total beef exports less the value of total beef imports) has become considerably less negative, increasing by 88 percent from 1980 to 1998. The overall improvement in the U. S. beef trade was characterized, however, by different trade impacts with the major export customers and import suppliers. These countries are Japan, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. Trade relationships and beef price effects in this article mainly address those {{of the first three}} countries. From 1990 to 1998, U. S. net imports of live cattle and beef (carcass weight) for all countries declined from 9. 2 percent to 5. 2 percent of total U. S. beef supplies. Given the average market price for that period and the coefficient of price flexibility, this decline implied an increase in nominal slaughter steer price of $ 4. 00 /cwt. However, this price effect was offset by other factors in the domestic market, such as large competitive production, increasing dressed weights, increasing wholesale-retail margins, and a decrease in consumer beef demand. Japan constitutes about 54 percent of the export market for U. S. beef. This country has been the fastest growing export market for high-value cuts of U. S. beef; quantities exported increased by 101 percent from 1990 to 1998. Strong economic growth (until 1997), trade liberalization, and changes in dietary preferences account for most of the increase. The result of these expanding exports, as a percentage of total beef disposition, was an increase in slaughter steer price of $ 1. 70 /cwt. U. S. beef and live cattle trade with Mexico has improved considerably (until recent import tariffs on U. S. beef); that is, net beef exports were negative at 357 million pounds in 1990 but became positive at 200 million pounds in 1998. Declines in imported Mexican cattle and increases in U. S. beef exports account for the change. Mexico currently accounts for nearly 20 percent of U. S. beef exports. The result of erasing the trade deficit over the 1990 to 1998 period was an increase in slaughter price of $ 2. 12 /cwt. The U. S. -Mexican net trade position in beef and live cattle may remain volatile in the future, however. The U. S. net beef trade position with Canada has declined considerably. Including trade in live cattle and beef, net imports from Canada increased from 2. 7 percent to 5. 2 percent of U. S. beef supplies from 1990 to 1998. In <b>general,</b> <b>imports</b> (cattle and beef) have significantly increased, while exports (cattle and beef) have increased little over this period. Reasons for the increased deficit include Canadian grain policies and feedlot expansion, U. S. excess capacity in meatpacking, a strong U. S. dollar and intercountry price differentials. The result was a reduction in U. S. slaughter price of $ 2. 55 /cwt. Economists, however, consider the U. S. -Canadian beef markets to be highly integrated. Thus, reducing the trade deficit may have little impact on U. S. slaughter price. Overall, U. S. trade in live cattle and beef has not reached the same importance as that of grain. Nevertheless, U. S. export and import quantities measured as a percentage of supplies or disposition imply that producer price effects are not zero. Domestic factors of beef dressed weights, red meat and poultry production, beef margins, feed costs, and consumer beef demand still dominate the price determination picture. The provisional tariff imposed on Canadian exports of live cattle, but recently removed by the U. S. International Trade Commission (ITC), would have slightly increased U. S. price and decreased Canadian price. But with compensating Canadian carcasses and beef entering the U. S. market, and increased slaughter costs, the gains may have been nullified.

40|$|Porin, also {{termed the}} voltage-dependent anion channel, {{is the most}} {{abundant}} protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane. The process of import and assembly of the protein {{is known to be}} dependent on the surface receptor Tom 20, but the requirement for other mitochondrial proteins remains controversial. We have used mitochondria from Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to analyze the import pathway of porin. Import of porin into isolated mitochondria in which the outer membrane has been opened is inhibited despite similar levels of Tom 20 as in intact mitochondria. A matrix-destined precursor and the porin precursor compete for the same translocation sites in both normal mitochondria and mitochondria whose surface receptors have been removed, suggesting that both precursors utilize the <b>general</b> <b>import</b> pore. Using an assay established to monitor the assembly of in vitro–imported porin into preexisting porin complexes we have shown that besides Tom 20, the biogenesis of porin depends on the central receptor Tom 22, as well as Tom 5 and Tom 7 of the <b>general</b> <b>import</b> pore complex (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane [TOM] core complex). The characterization of two new mutant alleles of the essential pore protein Tom 40 demonstrates that the import of porin also requires a functional Tom 40. Moreover, the porin precursor can be cross-linked to Tom 20, Tom 22, and Tom 40 on its import pathway. We conclude that import of porin does not proceed through the action of Tom 20 alone, but requires an intact outer membrane and involves at least four more subunits of the TOM machinery, including the <b>general</b> <b>import</b> pore...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} various {{environmental}} stresses (drought, chilling or herbicide treatment) on {{the capacity of}} plant mitochondria to import precursor proteins was investigated. Drought treatment stimulated import and processing of various precursor proteins via the <b>general</b> <b>import</b> pathway. The stimulatory effect of drought on the <b>general</b> <b>import</b> pathway was due to an increased rate of import, was accompanied by an increased rate of processing, and {{could be attributed to}} the presequence of the precursor protein. Interestingly, drought decreased the import of the FAd subunit of ATP synthase suggesting a bypass of the point of stimulation during import of this precursor. Both chilling and herbicide treatment of plants, on the other hand, caused inhibition of import with all precursors tested. No decrease in processing of imported proteins was observed by these stress treatments. Western analysis of several mitochondrial proteins indicated that the steady-state level of several mitochondrial components, including the TOM 20 receptor and the core subunits of the cytochrome bc 1 complex responsible for processing, remained largely unchanged. Thus environmental stresses differentially affect import of precursor proteins in a complicated manner dependent on the import pathway utilised...|$|R
40|$|Three {{types of}} trade policy {{adjustments}} {{to deal with}} an unsustainable current account deficit are examined in this paper for their economywide income and equity effects, {{based on the results of}} simulation experiments using a CGE model of the Philippine economy. Gross domestic product (GDP) expectably decreases with import rationing and less markedly, with the imposition of a <b>general</b> <b>import</b> surtax; by contrast, adjustment through the reduction of tariffs leads to a larger GDP. The latter result, however, is counterbalanced by a substantial loss in government income. With respect to the distribution of income gains (and losses), the additional market distortions and rent-seeking that accompany the implementation of import rationing heavily discriminate in favor of Metro Manila households, whose average income is the highest among the five household groups distinguished in the model. Moving to a <b>general</b> <b>import</b> surtax represents an improvement in that non-Metro Manila households are penalized less. However, these first two policy options are deemed inferior to tariff liberalization which yields larger income benefits to small-farm and "other rural" households relative to the more affluent Metro Manila, other urban, and large-farm households.

40|$|Protein import into chloroplasts {{relies on}} {{specific}} targeting of preproteins from the cytosol to the organelles and coordinated translocation processes across the double envelope membrane. Here, two complex machineries constitute {{the so called}} <b>general</b> <b>import</b> pathway, which consists of the TOC and TIC complexes (translocon at the outer envelope of chloroplasts and translocon at the inner envelope of chloroplasts, respectively). The majority of canonical preproteins feature an N-terminal cleavable transit peptide, which is necessary for targeting and recognition at the chloroplast surface by receptors of TOC, where Toc 159 acts as the primary contact site. We identified a non-canonical preprotein without the classical transit peptide, the superoxide dismutase (FSD 1), which was then used in chemical crosslinking approaches to find new interaction partners at the outer envelope from pea chloroplasts. In this way we could link FSD 1 {{to members of the}} Toc 159 family in pea, namely PsToc 132 and PsToc 120. Using deletion mutants as well as a peptide scanning approach we defined regions of the preprotein, which are involved in receptor binding. These are distributed across the entire sequence; however the extreme N-terminus as well as a C-proximal domain turned out to be essential for targeting and import. En route into the plastid FSD 1 engages components of the <b>general</b> <b>import</b> pathway, implying that in spite of the non-canonical targeting information and recognition by a specific receptor this preprotein follows a similar way across the envelope as the majority of plastid preproteins...|$|R
