25|$|Many gas-fed <b>heating</b> <b>appliances</b> such as ovens {{and water}} heaters {{make use of}} a pilot flame to ignite the main gas burner when required. If the pilot flame goes out, {{unburned}} gas may be released, which is an explosion risk and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a thermocouple in a fail-safe circuit to sense when the pilot light is burning. The tip of the thermocouple {{is placed in the}} pilot flame, generating a voltage which operates the supply valve which feeds gas to the pilot. So long as the pilot flame remains lit, the thermocouple remains hot, and the pilot gas valve is held open. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple temperature falls, causing the voltage across the thermocouple to drop and the valve to close.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a newly-developed of an electromagnetic induction fluid <b>heating</b> <b>appliance</b> using a heatedflow-through metallic package {{incorporated into the}} nonmetallic vessel in the pipeline, which is composed of series-loaded resonant phase-shift PWM high-frequency inverter using IGBT modules and their optirum driver modules {{in addition to an}} auto-tuning PID controller for temperature regulation. This efficient inverter-fed type fluid <b>heating</b> <b>appliance</b> is more acceptable for high-quality heat energy transfer and delivery processing plants operated under a precise temperature control scheme as well as heat-energy storage and heat exchange processing plants because of clean, safty and high-efficient energy conversion, compactness in volumetric size, and ease to control. In particular, the series capacitor-compensated resonant PWM inverter with a power factor correction and active sinewave line current-shaping functions is introduced for induction-heated pipeline fluid healing. The original structure of electromagnetic induction-heated metallic package in the nonmetallic vessel or tank for high-efficient fluid heating is demonstrated from a practical point of view, in which specially-designed fluid-through induction-heating metallic package assembly with a huge heating surface to induce the eddy current is incorporated into the nonmetallic cylindrical vessel with a working coil connected to a high-frequency AC power supply. The inherent remarkable features of this power electronic appliance are schematically pointed out and confirmed. Its operating characteristics in the steady-state are illustrated and evaluated. The prospective applications of this new conceptional fluid <b>heating</b> <b>appliance</b> are mentioned herein...|$|R

50|$|A {{convection}} heater is a heater which operates by air convection currents circulating {{through the body}} of the appliance, and across its heating element. This heats up the air, causing it to increase in volume and so become buoyant and rise. Oil heaters are an example of this kind of <b>heating</b> <b>appliance.</b> A {{convection heater}} may have an electrical heater element, a hot water coil, or a steam coil. Because of the natural ventilation, they are quieter in operation than fan heaters.|$|R
