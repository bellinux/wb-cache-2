5|$|Although {{the war had}} officially ended, a {{state of}} anarchy and {{lawlessness}} pervaded in the first <b>days</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian did not enter Rome until September of that year. In the meantime, Domitian acted as {{the representative of the}} Flavian family in the Roman Senate. He received the title of Caesar and was appointed praetor with consular power.|$|E
5|$|Both {{of these}} {{investigations}} began almost immediately. In the <b>days</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> tornado, Tinker's meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush and Captain Robert C.

By March 24, they had compiled several possible tornado indicators, and decided it would be difficult, but possible, to identify large tornado threat areas in the future.|$|E

5|$|Enderlin {{responded to}} Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had {{reported}} that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, {{who had worked for}} France 2 since 1988. In the <b>days</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the cyclone, the Australian government distributed financial and emergency aid, offering to provide assistance to hard-hit banana and sugar cane farmers in northern Queensland. Hundreds of State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers were deployed to restore electrical and water services, evacuate local citizens, provide food, and repair and protect structures. The Department of Social Security (DSS) sent employees to receive claims for damage, requests for financial aid, and filings for unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth of Australia initiated a three-year, $150million program to provide relief to damaged areas. Fund payments, however, were frequently incorrectly distributed, and in some cases, fraudulent. In the confusion in the <b>days</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> cyclone, looters stole possessions in areas within the vicinity of Innisfail, and relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms at Cairns. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) was subject to heavy criticism in the <b>days</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> storm's landfall, accused of not giving ample warning in advance of Winifred's approach; however, these concerns were later addressed in its report on the cyclone's impact. Due to the severity of the storm's damage, the name Winifred was retired after the season ended.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{incidents}} of harassment and hate crimes against Muslims and South Asians {{were reported in}} the <b>days</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> attacks. Sikhs were also targeted because Sikh males usually wear turbans, which are stereotypically associated with Muslims. There were reports of attacks on mosques and other religious buildings (including the firebombing of a Hindu temple), and assaults on people, including one murder: Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh mistaken for a Muslim, was fatally shot on September 15, 2001, in Mesa, Arizona.|$|E

5|$|Since {{statehood}} in 1845 {{there have}} been 43 people who have served as governor, one of whom served two distinct terms. Three state governors have served two full four-year terms: William D. Bloxham, in two stints; and Reubin Askew and Jeb Bush, who each served their terms consecutively. Bob Graham almost served two terms, as he resigned with only three days left. The shortest term in office belongs to Wayne Mixson, who served three <b>days</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> resignation of his predecessor, Bob Graham.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks {{next three}} games were against Northumberland, Gloucester, and Somerset. None of the sides scored against the All Blacks; with them losing by 31, 44, and 23 points to nil respectively. Four <b>days</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> Somerset match, the All Blacks faced Devonport Albion. Devonport Albion were England's club champion, and the runners-up for Great Britain club champion. 20,000 spectators {{witnessed}} another All Blacks victory; {{this time by}} 21–3.|$|E
5|$|The CGS {{warned that}} {{aftershocks}} were {{expected in the}} <b>days</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> earthquake and they could possibly continue for months. They recommended that buildings be evacuated {{in the event of}} an aftershock. The mining regulator's chief inspector of mines David Msiza asked mining companies in affected areas, including Klerksdorp, Carletonville and Rustenburg, to undertake underground inspections to ensure no miners were trapped and the working conditions were safe for miners. AngloGold Ashanti denied responsibility for the earthquake, saying it occurred away from its mining infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|The Constitution of Croatia {{mandates}} that the parliament consists {{of at least}} 100 members {{and no more than}} 160 members, elected by a direct secret ballot for four-year terms. Parliamentary elections are held within 60 <b>days</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> term's expiration or parliamentary dissolution (the latter takes place with a parliamentary no-confidence vote or if the parliament fails to approve a state budget within 120days after the government submits one for approval), and a new parliament must convene within 20 days after the elections.|$|E
5|$|The longest-serving {{governor}} was the first, George Clinton, who first took office on July 30, 1777, and served seven terms {{in two different}} periods, totaling just under 21 years in office. (As 18 of those years were consecutive, Clinton also served the longest consecutive period in office for a New York governor.) Charles Poletti had the shortest term, serving 29 <b>days</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> resignation of the previous governor in 1942. The current governor is Andrew Cuomo, who took office on January 1, 2011.|$|E
