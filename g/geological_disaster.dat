Decades later, shortly {{after the end of the}} First Pass, this beacon is picked up by a starship in the vicinity of Pern, and a landing party -- under the command of Lieutenant Ross Benden, nephew of the Admiral who commanded the Pernese colonization fleet -- is sent to respond. A quick survey by Lt. Benden's party finds no sign of human habitation on the Northern Continent, where the colony has taken refuge in underground caverns, and finds only one surviving family group in the South, at [...] "Honshu" [...] excavation. The now-elderly Stev Kimmer, a greedy and corrupt original colonist, rules over Honshu and his adopted family with an iron fist. He persuades Lt. Benden that he and the others in Honshu are the only survivors of the biological and <b>geological</b> <b>disaster</b> (i.e. Threadfall), and that they are a group small enough to evacuate entirely. Benden agrees despite his suspicions of Kimmer's true nature, only furthered by speaking to the family that had long lived under his domination, as well as Kimmer's all but openly hostile attitude towards himself (as Kimmer holds Benden's long-dead uncle personally responsible for the [...] "destruction" [...] of the colony). The rescue is dramatically successful, though Kimmer is killed when he is shot out of an airlock (implied to have been [...] "accidentally" [...] opened by one of his [...] "family"). Scientific investigation of Thread, as well as the belief there are no other humans on the planet -- none of the Honshu refugees could refute Kimmer's claim that they were the last survivors of the Pern colony -- leads the Federation to place Pern under strict interdict; the system is considered quarantined, all contact forbidden.|$|E

Households’ willingness to relocate under government order was measured, and divided into: 1  = strongly unwilling, 2  = unwilling, 3  = neutral, 4  = willing, 5  = strongly willing. In this study, households’ willingness to relocate under the government’s order indicates households’ willingness to permanently {{move away from the}} original residences (threatened by landslide disasters) to safe areas. This kind of permanent relocation is different from evacuation under imminent threat of a hazard or temporary relocation under potential threat. The former can fundamentally solve the problem of the threat of <b>geological</b> <b>disasters</b> faced by farming households.

30|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is to explore the influences of sense of place on the relocation willingness of farming households. Considering the variations in geology, populations at risk, and economic development levels, this study classified the 19 counties into two categories—those with more threatened people and low economic development level (11 counties); and those with fewer threatened people and high economic development level (8 counties). One county was randomly selected from each category, resulting in two sample counties: Wanzhou from the group of fewer threatened people and high economic development level and Fengjie from the other group, which together include 48 townships. Considering the number of farming households threatened, as well as the economic development level in the <b>geological</b> <b>disaster</b> threatened area, we selected three and two townships (with 11, 5, 5, 8, and 8 villages), respectively, from Wanzhou and Fengjie. According to the number of farming households who are threatened by <b>geological</b> <b>disaster</b> on the lists provided by the village cadres, we divided the 37 villages into high <b>geological</b> <b>disaster</b> threat villages and low <b>geological</b> <b>disaster</b> threat villages, then randomly picked one village from each group in every township. One of our sample townships has 11 villages. Considering the representativeness of the samples, we randomly picked one more high <b>geological</b> <b>disaster</b> threat village from this sample township. Finally, we obtained 11 sample villages. In the 11 sample villages, according to the <b>geological</b> <b>disaster</b> threat lists (on which a total of 2055 farming households were identified as threatened), we selected 20 – 40 threatened households from each for the survey.
