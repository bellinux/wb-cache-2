40|$|Children with {{neurological}} disabilities {{frequently have}} problems with <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> swallowing. Such problems {{have a significant impact}} on the health and well-being of these children and their families. The primary aims in the rehabilitation of pediatric <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> swallowing disorders are focused on supporting growth, nutrition and hydration, the development of <b>feeding</b> activities, <b>and</b> ensuring safe swallowing with the aim of preventing choking and aspiration pneumonia. Pediatric <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> swallowing disorders can be divided into four groups: transient, developmental, chronic or progressive. This article provides an overview of the available literature about the rehabilitation of <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> swallowing disorders in infants and children.

Although specific neuropeptide Y antagonists are not yet available, previous studies had shown that the opioid antagonist naloxone blocked neuropeptide Y-induced feeding when both drugs were injected intracerebroventricularly. We {{wanted to find out}} if naloxone injected into specific brain sites would block neuropeptide Y effects on <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> brown fat thermogenesis. Rats were double injected in specific brain sites with neuropeptide Y and either naloxone or naltrexone (a congener of naloxone). Food intake and brown fat measures were assessed. Naloxone or naltrexone in the paraventricular nucleus weakly decreased paraventricular nucleus neuropeptide Y-induced <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> did not affect neuropeptide Y-induced reductions in brown fat activity. Peripheral naloxone blocked intracerebroventricular neuropeptide Y-induced <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> brown fat alterations. Fourth ventricular naloxone decreased paraventricular nucleus neuropeptide Y-induced <b>feeding,</b> <b>and</b> naltrexone given into the nucleus of the solitary tract blocked paraventricular nucleus neuropeptide Y-induced alterations in <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> brown fat.

40|$|Problematic <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> {{sleeping}} is an unrelenting {{issue for}} many parents. Research has identified that childhood obesity {{may be related}} to both areas. These are two aspects of development very heavily influenced by parents. This study therefore addresses the question “is there a relationship between problematic sleeping <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> in infants?” It further considers whether parenting style is a common link between the two. Nineteen parents of children aged between 18 and 48 months were interviewed about their parenting strategies in general, and more specifically about <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> sleeping behaviours of their children. They also completed diaries and questionnaires. The data was analysed to ascertain whether there was a relationship between <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> sleeping problems and whether these problems related to a number of parenting measures. Strategies utilised by parents to handle <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> sleeping problems were also ascertained. The sample that volunteered for this study did not report sleeping <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> problems so information about these problems was derived from diary measures. <b>Feeding</b> <b>and</b> sleeping problems were evident on these measures and parents employed numerous different strategies to handle them. There was no difference evident in the strategies adopted by parents of preschoolers with and without sleep <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> problems.

40|$|Background: Inappropriate child <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> caring {{practices}} {{are a major}} cause of malnutrition. To date, no studies have examined concordance and discordance of child <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> preventive behavior and their predictors in developing countries. Methods: We used baseline data generated from A 2 -year-longitudinal agriculture-nutrition panel survey conducted from February 9 to April 9, 2014, in nine districts encompassing 20 randomly selected counties in Oromiya Region and Southern Nation, Nationality and Peoples Region in Ethiopia. Households were recruited using the Expanded Program on Immunization sampling method. A total of 623 {{children under the age of}} 5 years and their respective caregivers were included in the analyses. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for clustered observations. Results: Concordance of poor child <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> preventive behavior was observed in 45. 1 % of the children, while 45. 5 % of the children were suffering from discordance of poor child <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> preventive behavior. Concordance and discordance of poor child <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> preventive behavior had almost different predictors. Concordance of poor child <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> preventive behavior was significantly associated with the age of the caretaker of >= 40 years (odds ratio (OR) = 2. 14; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 04, 4. 41), low household dietary diversity (OR = 3. 69; 95 % CI: 1. 93, 7. 04), medium household dietary diversity (OR = 2. 17; 95 % CI: 1. 17, 4. 00), severe household food insecurity (OR = 1. 72; 95 % CI: 1. 01, 2. 93), and increase with increasing child age. Conclusion: A substantial number of children in the southwest of rural Ethiopia are exposed to both poor child <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> preventive behavior. Low household dietary diversity and extreme food insecurity household were predictors of concordance of poor child <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> poor preventive behavior and provide useful entry points for comprehensive interventions to address child <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> caring in the area...|$|R

40|$|Feeding {{requires}} {{the integration of}} homeostatic drives with emotional states relevant to food procurement in potentially hostile environments. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) regulates <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> anxiety, but how these are controlled in a concerted manner remains unclear. Using pharmacogenetic, optogenetic, and calcium imaging approaches with a battery of behavioral assays, we demonstrate that VMH steroidogenic factor 1 (SF 1) neurons constitute a nutritionally sensitive switch, modulating the competing motivations of <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> avoidance of potentially dangerous environments. Acute alteration of SF 1 neuronal activity alters food intake via changes in appetite and feeding-related behaviors, including locomotion, exploration, anxiety, and valence. In turn, intrinsic SF 1 neuron activity is low during <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> increases with both <b>feeding</b> termination <b>and</b> stress.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} better {{understanding}} of the characteristics of <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> breeding practices smallholder farmers adopt in intensifying their dairy production. Use of hired labour for fodder gathering, growing of fodder crops <b>and</b> purchase of <b>feeds</b> increased with increasing intensification, but Bos taurus breeds did not respond to increasing feeding intensification while Bos indicus cattle responded, calving at earlier age and yielding more milk. Overall, first calving occurred at 32 months, but days open prolonged to 250 days with milk yield of 4 litres per day of calving interval. A principal component analysis extracted six <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> breeding components, explaining 71. 79 % of the total variations in <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> breeding practices for dairy intensification. The six components were labelled: non- intensified <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> breeding; breeding decisions based-intensification; high external resource based-intensification; moderate resource based-intensification; resource poor based-intensification; and moderate external resource based-intensification.
