40|$|AbstractIn a <b>freezing</b> <b>tunnel,</b> food {{products}} are cooled and frozen by cold circulating air. The products give off heat to the air, which is cooled down again {{in an air}} cooler. Refrigeration systems with freezing tunnels consume considerable amounts of energy and improvements in the tunnel design may reduce energy use. The necessary freezing time for products inside the tunnel depends strongly on air velocity and distribution. Uneven air velocity distribution results in non-homogeneous product freezing times and inefficient energy use for fans and refrigeration systems. The analysis of the tunnel design has been performed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with the software tool ANSYS Airpak. The analysis {{is based on an}} existing freezing plant where different ceiling geometries have been tested for the same model. This was done in order to identify problem areas, to improve the design, and to obtain better air distribution and optimized fan power consumption. Results from the simulations show that fan power and air distribution can be strongly influenced by ceiling design and use of air guidance vanes, which may {{have a significant impact on}} the overall energy use for such a <b>freezing</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Several alternative ceiling designs resulted in a final version with reduction in total energy consumption of approximately 12 % compared to the baseline configuration. The minimum air fluxes over the products were increased from 2. 6 to 4 kg/sm 2; resulting in reduced necessary freezing time...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFish {{products}} are frozen to preserve quality and extend shelf-life. However, freezing {{processes in the}} industry are typically very energy demanding and seldom optimized with regard to energy usage. During freezing, the operating conditions for the refrigeration cycle, {{as well as the}} driving temperature difference over the product changes significantly from start to finish. A complete transient model including a refrigeration plant, an air blast <b>freezing</b> <b>tunnel</b> and food products has been built, based on the Modelica programming language. The product model is discretized into uniform layers, described with equations for temperature dependent properties such as thermal conductivity and heat capacity. Normally, fan power represents about 25 – 30 % of the total refrigeration requirement, {{but at the end of}} the freezing process, heat from the fans can represent up to 95 - 99 % of the refrigeration load. The results from this model indicates that a 33 % reduction in total power consumption, with a penalty of 14 % longer freezing time is possible with better operation of the fan. In general, this model can be a useful tool for visualization of energy saving measures. It combines a product model with a refrigeration system, demonstrating the effect of process modification on both single components and overall process performance...|$|E
40|$|This impact {{evaluation}} of a computer-based refrigeration control system (RCS) installed at Columbia Colstor in 1990 was conducted for the Bonneville Power Administration (Bonneville) by Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL). Concurrent with installing the RCS, the plant was expanded by adding 13, 900 m{sup 2 } (150, 000 ft{sup 2 } of storage space and five <b>freeze</b> <b>tunnels.</b> Because this project involved a significant plant expansion, it was ineligible for participation in Bonneville`s Energy $avings Plan Program (E$P). Therefore, a special contract was negotiated. This contract followed, to the extent possible, the E$P principles, adminstrative procedures, and acquisition payment. The primary objectives of this {{impact evaluation}} were to assess how much electrical energy is being saved at Columbia Colstor {{as a result of}} the Bonneville`s acquisition payment and to determine how much the savings cost Bonneville and the region. The impact of the project was evaluated with a combination of engineering analysis, billing analysis, financial analysis, interviews, and submittal reviews. Based on this impact evaluation, energy savings from this project are expected to be at least 4, 130, 700 kilowatt-hours/year (kWh/yr), or 0. 47 average megawatts (aMW).

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the risks associated with the repetitive movements of the upper limbs in different meat processing tasks in a poultry slaughterhouse. The study was conducted in a company with 4, 500 workers that slaughtered 450, 000 chickens/poultries per day during the two shifts. The OCRA checklist was used to assess 10 % of the total workforce during work tasks. Each worker was filmed for shorter periods of 5 minutes. Student's t-test (p≤ 0. 05) was used to compare the risk variable between the sides of the body. The 26 work activities analyzed were the following sectors: cutting (17); evisceration (2); <b>freezing</b> <b>tunnels</b> (2); reception (3) and scalding (2). The average of occupational repetitive actions performed by poultry workers was 63. 7 ± 25. 3 per minute, representing 9 points in the OCRA's scale (0 to 10 points scale). The average score of OCRA's checklist was 18. 3 ± 2. 7 (moderate risk). The scores for the right upper limb (18 ± 2. 8 - moderate risk) were significantly higher (p= 0. 014) than the contralateral limb (16. 9 ± 3. 8 - moderate risk). Considering the five risk categories proposed by the OCRA method, 2 work tasks were considered high risk (8 %); 21 represented moderate risk (81 %), and 3 were within an low risk (11 %). When grouping the high risk tasks with the moderate risk tasks, it was verified that the majority of the slaughterhouse workers were vulnerable to ergonomic hazards by repetitive movements. From these results, it is possible to suggest that poultry processing tasks classified as high (8 %) and moderate risk (81 %) predispose workers to a greater probability of developing upper limb work-related musculoskeletal disorders (> 21. 5 % probability for high risk and 10. 8 to 21. 5 % for moderate risk) ...|$|R
40|$|Freezing is a {{commonly}} used preservation method {{in the meat}} industry. The understanding of the product behavior during the freezing process can assist in a better process management and quality control. This work reports the study of freezing and thawing of three types of processed meat {{in order to determine}} process parameters in an industrial forced‑air <b>freezing</b> <b>tunnel</b> at ‑ 30 oC. Chicken sausages (frankfurter type), mortadela (bologna type) and mechanically deboned chicken meat (MDCM) were studied. Products were placed in several layers in corrugated cardboard boxes (CCB) for sausages and mortadela. MDCM was placed in a nylon box. Temperature sensors were inserted in the products and the freezing and thawing curves were obtained. Freezing curves were used to determine the freezing time (tf), initial freezing point (Tf) and final freezing point (T’m). Products placed in different layers in the CCB had significantly different freezing times, being the higher rates for products placed in more external layers than internal ones. The external layers of product were subjected to heat transfer by convection showing its importance to decrease freezing time. The results strongly suggest that products placed in different layers could have distinct quality properties and also {{play a key role in}} the freezing process efficiency. ...|$|E

40|$|Fish {{is one of}} Norway’s main exports, and can {{be shipped}} fresh, frozen or dried. This thesis {{examines}} the freezing of fish in batch tunnels and ways to increase the energy efficiency of this process. A fish freezing plant {{on the west coast}} of Norway was used as a baseline case and measurements were made of the freezing system. Different aspects of this system were simulated, mainly using MATLAB. The focus was on the compressors and the freezing tunnels of an industrial refrigeration system. The compressors and the <b>freezing</b> <b>tunnel</b> fans are the largest consumers of electricity, but they are often not operated at the highest efficiency. An analysis of the compressor operation showed that it was far from optimal, with several compressors often operating at part-load simultaneously. These were screw compressors regulated by slide valves, which provide easy capacity control, but also have low energy efficiency. The refrigeration system had several different sized compressors, and the results showed {{that it was possible to}} run the system with only one compressor at part-load operation. The total coefficient of performance was improved by as much as 29 % for a low production period. A further analysis showed that installing a variable speed drive on one compressor would also improve energy efficiency and make capacity regulation straightforward. The freezing system included five batch freezing tunnels, each of which had a freezing capacity of more than 100 tonnes of pelagic fish. A typical freezing period lasted typically 20 h and decreased the fish temperature to - 18 ◦C or below. The main task was to develop a computer program that could simulate the freezing process and the refrigeration system and locate opportunities for improvement. The air velocities inside the <b>freezing</b> <b>tunnel</b> varied with location, which were pinpointed using the computational fluid dynamics software program Airpak. These velocities were used in freezing time calculations. It was shown that a guide blade installed in the air flow at a critical location improved the air velocity distribution compared with no guide blade. Without the guide blade, the freezing times of the products were between 16 h and 32 h, but with a guide blade they were between 17 h and 21 h, a span of only 4 h. These freezing times were calculated with a modified Plank’s equation. A numerical model was programmed in MATLAB and it was used to simulate the temperatures of the products. The model was a two-dimensional finite difference approximation of the heat conduction equation. The simulation results were compared to measured temperatures, to validate the model. The measured temperatures were also used for validation of another simulation program, programmed in Modelica. The final stage of this research involved testing different alternatives for reduced fan operation. The program for the product model was extended with models for calculating the energy consumption of the air fans and the compressors and using Airpak-simulated velocities. The air fan speed was reduced to 83 %, 67 %, 50 % and 33 % of full air fan speed. This was tested at 5 different points during the freezing period, to see how the freezing times were affected. Full air speed during the freezing period resulted in a total freezing time of 20 h. A reduction in air fan speed to 33 % after 8 h resulted in an increase in total freezing time of 10 hours (47 % longer) but reduced energy consumption to 73. 8 % of the baseline case. An alternative with only 4 h longer freezing time resulted in an energy consumption of 80. 5 % of the baseline case. It was assumed that the fans had variable speed drives. The effect of reduced air inlet temperature was also tested and the results show that this can reduce freezing times. The effect on the total energy consumption was not large and also depends on the rest of the refrigeration system. Issues raised by this thesis are relevant for future research. It is suggested that the main simulation program is expanded by incorporating more detailed models of the refrigeration system. Dynamic operation of the air fans is also a possibility, for example to gradually reduce fan speed with decreasing product heat load.

40|$|Nowadays a {{high quality}} {{standard}} of fish products, either fresh or frozen, is desired. Therefore a fast processing is of the highest priority. Since the world-wide consump-tion is rising steadily, larger refrigeration plants and warehouses are being built. Consequently, the energy usage of such facilities is increasing. To offset the additional electricity costs, the energy efficiency must be improved either by inventing and investigating new and highly efficient industrial processes. Furthermore, increasingly stringent environmental standards impose even higher efforts on developing refrigeration systems with natural refrigerants. Ammonia {{is known as the}} thermodynamic most efficient refrigerant and is used for many applications, including {{the state of the art}} industrial refrigeration of the pelagic fish. However there are limitations of using ammonia as a coolant. As an example, the application is limited below - 40 &# 176;C and the efficiency reduces significantly due to the required high pressure ratio and the high specific volume. Opposed to ammonia, carbon dioxide with its high volumetric efficiency has unique benefits in the temperature range between - 40 &# 176;C and - 50 &# 176;C. Due to the smaller system components, capacity enhancements have been realized for offshore applications in cascade systems with ammonia as high temperature media. Although many NH 3 /CO 2 cascade systems have proven to be highly efficient in various applications all over the world, this technology has not yet been established for onshore plants within the pelagic fish industry in Norway. Therefore the motivation for this thesis was the investigation of a cascade refrigeration system for a given <b>freezing</b> <b>tunnel</b> provided by Norway Pelagic AS.

Besides the investigation of various system parameters that mainly affected the freezing process time and the energy consumption, an energy recovery system was designed and a laboratory facility was constructed. Additionally, the effect of the substantial vulnerability for pressure losses and the resulting temperature reduction on the evaporator side was discussed.

40|$|This is a {{final report}} of the project DANTEQ (2010 - 2015). Through this project new {{competence}} and new methods for optimal handling of whitefish onboard with respect to raw material quality and energy efficiency have been developed. The project was divided into four research areas; (1) catch handling, (2) chilling and freezing, (3) energy systems and (4) modelling. The main results are given below: Short time live storage of fish befare killing: When towing times are short and catches are small a survival of 50 - 80 % was found for cod (density of fish in the storage tank varied from 120 to 550 kg/m 3). The fishing depth has influence on survival rate. The stress level of the fish was lower straight after catch than after storage in live holding tanks onboard (not always significant differences). Less blood was found in fillets from live stored fish and fish processed straight after catch compared to commercial processed fish. Electro stunning of fish: Voltage of 40 V DC is enough to achieve satisfactory immobilizing and easier handling of catch in connection with further processing (bleeding/gutting/heading) for cod, haddock and saithe. Three rows of electrodes on the stunner (current load for 4 - 6 seconds) is enough to achieve satisfactory immobilization. Electro stunning of saithe lead to broken backbone and bloodspots on 10 to 40 % of the fish. Freezing of cod: Pre-rigor cod frozen in a magnetic field ((ell Alive System) achieved minimal differences in quality compared to traditional <b>tunnel</b> <b>freezing</b> and freezing in a cold room, in spite of different freezing rates. The mechanism for freezing of fish in magnetic field appeared {{to be similar to}} that of traditional freezing methods. Chilling of cod and haddock: Fish stored in slurry had a different microstructure and different water distribution, measured by low field NMR, than those stored in flake ice. Differences in colour and QIM­score were found for haddock stored under the two conditions. Logging of operational data: Software for acquisition and storage of operational data has been developed. Systems for acquisition and storage of operational data, as well as transfer of the data to an on-shore server, have been installed on-board two trawlers. Software for efficient analysis of operational data has been developed and used to generate operational profiles. Model development: Methods and models for simulating catch handling processes have been developed, along with proof-of-concept software that demonstrates their practical use. Discrete event simulation seems to be a very suitable method for 5 imulating and evaluating fish processing lines, though more work needs to be done with regards to model quality and validation. Acquiring high-quality data about catch handling processes for modelling purposes is difficult and labour-intensive. Future experiments should be designed to focus more on individual processes and less on the whole line, and should aim to keep better track of the "human factors" that add noise and affect the outcome...|$|R
