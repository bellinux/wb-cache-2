25|$|The Hiduminium alloys or R.R. alloys are {{a series}} of high-strength, {{high-temperature}} aluminium alloys, developed for aircraft use by Rolls-Royce ("RR") before World War II. They were manufactured and later developed by <b>High</b> <b>Duty</b> Alloys Ltd.. The name Hi-Du-Minium is derived from that of <b>High</b> <b>Duty</b> Aluminium Alloys.|$|E
25|$|<b>High</b> <b>Duty</b> Alloys Ltd. {{was founded}} at Farnham Road, Slough in 1927, by Colonel W. C. Devereux.|$|E
25|$|Advantages {{of these}} alloys were {{recognised}} worldwide. When 576 pistons in Hiduminium R.R.59 alloy {{were used for}} the Italian Marshal Balbo's trans-Atlantic flight, <b>High</b> <b>Duty</b> Alloys used it in their own advertising.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} alloys {{expanded}} {{to support a}} range of applications and processing techniques. At the Paris Airshow of 1953, <b>High</b> <b>Duty</b> Alloys showed no less than eight different Hiduminium R.R. alloys: 20, 50, 56, 58, 66, 77, 80, 90. Also shown were gas turbine compressor and turbine blades in Hiduminium, {{and a range of}} their products in the Magnuminium alloy series.|$|E
25|$|Smuggling was an {{important}} industry in the area, and the men of Broadstairs and St Peter's became very good at outwitting customs agents. This was very profitable because of the very <b>high</b> <b>duty</b> payable on tea, spirits and tobacco. There is a network of tunnels and caves strewn in the chalk strata which were used by smugglers to hide their contraband.|$|E
25|$|In 1934 the Reynolds Tube Co. began {{production}} of extruded structural components for airframes, using R.R.56 alloy supplied by <b>High</b> <b>Duty</b> Alloys. A new purpose-built plant was constructed at their works in Tyseley, Birmingham. In time, the post-war Reynolds company, already {{known for its}} steel bicycle frame tubes, would attempt {{to survive in the}} peacetime market by supplying Hiduminium alloy components for high-end aluminium bicycle cranks and brakes.|$|E

5000|$|The Church [...] "condemns as immoral {{and violent}} change of government, every revolution". However, if the violent {{takeover}} has occurred [...] "the Church teaches that the <b>highest</b> <b>duty</b> of every {{government is to}} take care of public prosperity. At the time of revolution, the <b>highest</b> <b>duty</b> of the government and the citizens is to end chaos as soon as possible and to build on the ruins of the old a new state, which will function as a device of public prosperity. If the revolutionary government is strong and able enough to positively organize the state to reach its goal, than this <b>highest</b> <b>duty</b> requires of every citizen to recognize the new government.". In these essays he stated that in time of war, the Church's duty is to [...] "reduce the horror of the war" [...] and care for war prisoners.|$|R

He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it.

[...] "Then it is not deterrent," [...] mutters the gentleman whose rude forefather hooted the hangman. Well, as to that, the law which is to accomplish more than a part of its purpose must be awaited with great patience. Every murder proves that hanging is not altogether deterrent; every hanging, that it is somewhat deterrent--it deters the person hanged. A man's first murder is his crime, his second is ours.|$|E
6000|$|The {{circumstances}} {{connected with}} {{the writing of the}} ode have been described by Lowell in his private letters. It appears that he was reluctant to undertake the task, and for several weeks his mind utterly refused to respond to the <b>high</b> <b>duty</b> put upon it. At last the sublime thought came to him upon the swift wings of inspiration. [...] "The ode itself," [...] he says, [...] "was an improvisation. Two days before the commemoration I had told my friend Child that it was impossible--that I was dull as a door-mat. But the next day something gave me a jog, and the whole thing came out of me with a rush. I sat up all night writing it out clear, and took it {{on the morning of the}} day to Child." [...] In another letter he says: [...] "The poem was written with a vehement speed, which I thought I had lost in the skirts of my professor's gown. Till within two days of the celebration I was hopelessly dumb, and then it all came with a rush, literally making me lean (mi fece magro), and so nervous that I was weeks in getting over it." [...] In a note in Scudder's biography of Lowell (Vol. II., p. 65), it is stated upon the authority of Mrs. Lowell that the poem was begun at ten o'clock the night before the commemoration day, and finished at four o'clock in the morning. [...] "She opened her eyes to see him standing haggard, actually wasted by the stress of labor and the excitement which had carried him through a poem full of passion and fire, of five hundred and twenty-three lines, in the space of six hours." ...|$|E
