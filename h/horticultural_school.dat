40|$|J. J. Smith {{was born}} June 29 th, 1867, at Antwerp, {{where his father}} was the {{director}} of the Netherlands’ Railway Post Office. In 1872 the family moved to Utrecht and in 1875 to Amsterdam. Smith spent his school days in the capital. His leisure hours were occupied by growing and sketching plants and tending such animals as mice and keeping an aquarium and a terrarium. His 10 th birthday was celebrated by the establishment of a private herbarium, the first plant inserted being Bellis perennis. His years at secondary school were greatly influenced by the then teacher of Natural History, Dr J. C. Costerus, who advised Smith to look for a position in horticulture. <b>Horticultural</b> <b>schools</b> being not yet ”en vogue“, Smith got his education in this field at the Horticulturist’s Messrs Groenewegen & Co., Amsterdam. In these years the Orchids began to impress him and Smith spent his few free hours in making pictures of flowering species. The connection with Dr Costerus was continued. Together they looked after their herbaria and later on started to study teratologica, found in the Groenewegen gardens and greenhouses, a field in which both would publish several valuable papers later on. After having been working for his firm for 3 ½ years, Smith went to Kew where he stayed one year and afterwards to Brussels for completing his horticultural knowledge and skill.

50|$|The Society then built {{permanent}} colonies {{consisting of}} small colony houses {{with a little}} ground. Those houses were regularly spaced along straight roads. The colonies I and II were later transformed into the village Frederiksoord, the other colonies to the villages Wilhelminaoord and Boschoord (in Southwest Drenthe) and Willemsoord (in Northwest Overijssel). Here were about 1400 families collected in the period 1818-1911. To educate the population and safeguarding of bad influences, the Society founded its own schools and they implemented “'colony money”. That money did not exist long, but the schools did. In addition to elementary schools, the Society also founded vocational training schools which operated from 1829 to 1859 as the 'Institute for Agriculture' in Wateren and the “Gerard Adriaan van Swieten” horticultural and forestry school in Frederiksoord and the ”Gerard Adriaan van Swieten” Agricultural School in 1884 in Willemsoord.The foundation of these schools {{was made possible by}} a donation from the former major of cavalry, F.H.

40|$|Effects of Shallow Plowing Tools on the Soil Structural State and the Potatoes Crop Yield. Effects {{of three}} tillage tools (disc harrow, teeth harrow and rotary cultivator) on two {{physical}} characteristics of silt-sandy soil (resistance to the penetration Rp and voluminous mass Mv) {{and their potential}} influence on fresh matter and total yield of potato were studied at the experimental field of the <b>Horticultural</b> <b>School,</b> Chott-Mariem (Sousse). Results show that the three tools reduce the resistance penetration and the voluminous mass of soil tilled especially using disc harrow at 15 cm depth (Rp= 2. 8 daN/cm 2 and Mv= 1. 03 g/ cm 3) compared with non tilled soil (Rp= 11. 4 daN/cm 2, Mv= 1. 43 g/cm 3). Highest fresh matter yield was obtained (at 130 days) after soil ploughing with disc harrow showing an average increase of 33, 24, 18 and 15 % respectively for leaves, tubercles, stems and roots compared with other tools. Best tubercles yield was also reached using disc harrow showing an increase of 21 % and 24 % compared, respectively, to teeth harrow and rotary cultivator...|$|E

40|$|Fruit tree genetic {{resources}} and disease resistance. Since 1975, the Plant Pathology Station bas been collecting fruit tree cultivars which were formerly grown in Belgium. The number of accessions is now over 2 500, mostly of apples, pears and plums, {{all of which}} are planted in the open on dwarfing or semi-dwarfing rootstocks. One third of the material was recovered from old, often endangered collections in <b>horticultural</b> <b>schools</b> and to a minor extent from collections abroad, and two thirds from old orchards on faims and in gardens. A preference was given to material originated in Belgium either as landraces or as cultivars produced by recognized breeders from the part two centuries. The initial aim, which is still a priority, was to evaluate a broad range of old cultivars for useful characters, with an emphasis on disease resistance. As the collection expanded, a conservation objective also developed. From 1985 on, the Station started to reintroduce in the nursery trade and to recommend for home-growing the better cultivars emerging from the evaluation. Fifteen cultivars were released up to now, among which ten apples, four plums and one peach cv. Corresponding technical leaflets were also edited. The project had a multiform social impact ever since the outset. Both the collecting work and réintroduction process were a Ovide success with the public, which led a number of commercial growers to experiment with some of the recommended apple cultivars. As a further step in the utilization of {{genetic resources}}, the Station bas been producing yearly since 1988 several thousands of hybrid seedlings from interesting old apple cultivars with the aim of creating new material of commercial value with low disease susceptibility...|$|R
