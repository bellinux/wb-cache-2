40|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation {{as a light}} source, absorption spectra of membrane lipids and spike proteins, viral components of Sendai virus, were obtained in the wavelength regions from 130 nm to 320 nm. The absorption spectrum of lipids have {{a broad peak at}} 190 nm and a steep rise below 160 nm, while purification of lipids caused a decrease in absorption at the wavelength longer than 170 nm and an increase below 160 nm. From this result, the rather flat absorption of crude lipids in the longer wavelength region is concluded to originate from <b>diffused</b> <b>reflection.</b> Spike proteins show a small peak at 280 nm and a shoulder at 230 nm in addition to a more pronounced peak at 190 nm and a slight increase below 160 nm.

Both these kinds of paths are simple and piecewise-convex. However, computing optimal paths {{in the context of}} <b>diffuse</b> or specular <b>reflections</b> {{does not seem to be}} an easy task. A path from a light source s to t inside P is called a <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path if the turning points of the path lie in the interiors of the boundary edges of P. A <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path is said to be optimal if it has the minimum number of turning points amongst all <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> paths between s and t. The minimum <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path may not be simple. The problem of computing the minimum <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path in low degree polynomial time has remained open. In our quest for understanding the geometric structure of the minimum <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> paths vis-a-vis shortest paths and minimum link paths, we define a new kind of <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path called a constrained <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path where (i) the path is simple, (ii) it intersects only the eaves of the Euclidean shortest path between s and t, and (iii) it intersects each eave exactly once. For computing a minimum constrained <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path from s to t, we present an O(n(n+β)) time algorithm, where β =Θ (n^ 2) in the worst case. Here, β depends on the shape of the polygon. We also establish some properties relating minimum constrained <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> paths and minimum <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> paths.

TL measurements (heating to 370 ºC at 1 ºC/s) indicate that the near-surface layer does not seem to emit TL at ~ 250 - 400 ºC, especially in the blue range, even in TL measurements after re-irradiation. In contrast, the layer seems to emit more TL at ~ 130 ºC than the inner original quartz.

40|$|National audienceThe {{acoustic}} prediction {{for transportation}} vehicles (ground transportation, aeronautics, naval application) at design stage {{is an increasing}} issue for the industry. Due to reduced development times, the acoustic design must start in the early stage of projects and follow the whole development phase, requiring precise and reactive prediction tools. The most widely used computation methods perform a numerical resolution of Helmholtz equation with a spatial discretization into Finite Elements or Boundary Elements. These methods are efficient in the low frequency range, but they reach their limits at higher frequencies, due to high computational cost, very precise mesh required, and high sensitivity to geometry and frequency. Ray Tracing techniques may be an alternative in some cases, but <b>diffused</b> <b>reflection</b> is generally ignored and convergence is not always reached. The method proposed here is also based on a light/sound analogy, but the resolution is based on acoustic intensity equilibrium on Boundary Elements. Acoustic domain boundaries (Walls and structures) are modeled by finite elements of which the physical properties are the absorption and transmission coefficients. The mesh size is led only by the geometry description and is not frequency dependent: thus the computation time is drastically reduced. Transparency phenomenon and internal noise issue have been recently implemented in the method in order to compute multi-domain acoustic fluid.

30|$|The AR {{properties}} of the non-compact nanopyramid structure {{and the effect of}} the buffer layer on the AR properties were analyzed with FDTD simulation. As shown in the simulation results (Figure  6 c), the reflectance from the air-Si interface increases as the spacing (d in Figure  6 a) between the neighboring nanopyramids increases. In addition, the FDTD simulation result also shows that a PDMS buffer layer further reduces the reflectance: the reflectance was reduced by approximately 5 % over all the wavelength regions. These simulation results correspond well with the experimental results shown in Figure  7. In addition, although a buffer layer is deposited on the Si nanostructure, a reflection occurs at the surface of the buffer layer because of the difference in n between air and the PDMS buffer layer (see the small step in Figure  5 c). However, we observed that surface of a PDMS layer was not perfectly flat. As shown in the AFM image (Figure  6 b), the PDMS layer has a rough surface with the roughness of approximately 20  nm. This rough surface was naturally formed when the PDMS layer was coated on the Si nanostructures through the doctor blade technique. This rough surface of the PDMS layer induces a <b>diffused</b> <b>reflection</b> like the Si nanostructures on a Si plate and thus, the reflectance at the interface between air and PDMS layer is decreased [28]. The FDTD simulation result clearly demonstrates this fact (Figure  6 d): relatively uniform low reflectance was obtained by the rough surface of the PDMS layer on the fabricated Si nanostructures (black line in Figure  6 d). However, a flat surface of the PDMS layer with the thickness of 1  μm could induce the fluctuated and slightly high reflectance (blue line in Figure  6 d) compared to that of the rough PDMS surface. These are because constructive and destructive interferences between reflections from the flat PDMS surface and the Si nanostructures are alternately occurred due to the flat surface of the PDMS layer (inset of Figure  6 d). On the other hand, the rough surface of the PDMS layer could randomly scatter the reflections from the PDMS surface and the Si nanostructures, and thus, these arbitrarily scattered reflections by the rough PDMS surface could be dissipated through the destructive inference of themselves. Therefore, Si nanostructures and a PDMS buffer layer with a rough surface can dramatically improve the AR {{properties of}} a Si surface (Figure  7).|$|E
