40|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>knitting</b> is {{a widely}} used fabric {{manufacturing}} technology. Compared with warp knitting and circular <b>knitting,</b> <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> is characterized by its higher process flexibility and greater fabric structure variety. In this work, <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> technology was exploited to fabricate auxetic fabrics which laterally expand when stretched. Three kinds of geometrical structures, i. e. foldable structure, rotating rectangle and reentrant hexagon, were employed as basic reference structures {{for the development of}} these kinds of auxetic fabrics. The weft knitting processes based on these structures were specially developed and auxetic fabrics were fabricated using the computerized <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> machines. The Poisson's ratio-strain curves of the developed fabrics were plotted and compared with those calculated using existing models to demonstrate the variation trends of Poisson's ratio with the axial strain. The results reveal that except the folded fabric formed with the face loops and reverse loops in a rectangular arrangement, of which the auxetic effect firstly increases and then decreases with the axial strain, the auxetic effects of all other fabrics decrease with an increase of the axial strain. The work also shows that auxetic fabrics can be realized based on knitted structures and that <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> technology can provide a simple, but highly effective way of fabricating auxetic fabrics from conventional yarns.

50|$|Aran {{knitting}} {{patterns are}} very adaptable, and {{are widely used}} in many types of knitted items, including hats, scarves, skirts, and even decorative pillows. The recent revival of interest in handcrafts have led to many modern variations of both stitches and designs.

However, unlike typical round knitting, the knitting is turned after a full round of squares so the next set is knitted in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} methods for double <b>knitting,</b> {{including}} <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> on double-pointed knitting needles; after one row has been worked with one yarn, the knitter slides the stitches {{to the other}} end of the needle and begins the same row with the next yarn. Only half the stitches are knitted with any one yarn; the rest are slipped. After both passes are done, the knitter then turns the work and begins another row.|$|R
5000|$|In Industrial Knitting applications, {{the terms}} [...] "Flat" [...] and [...] "Circular" [...] have very {{different}} meanings to those given above. A [...] "Flat" [...] or Vee Bed knitting machine consists of 2 flat needle beds arranged in an upside-down [...] "V" [...] formation. These needle beds can be up to 2.5 metres wide. A carriage, {{also known as a}} Cambox or Head, moves backwards and forwards across these needle beds, working the needles to selectively, knit, tuck or transfer stitches. A <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> machine is very flexible, allowing complex stitch designs, shaped knitting and precise width adjustment.

2500|$|In using circulars to <b>knit</b> <b>flat</b> {{pieces of}} fabric the two ends are used just as two {{separate}} needles would be. [...] The knitter holds one tip {{in each hand}} and knits straight across {{the width of the}} fabric, turns the work, and knits or purls back the other way. [...] Using circular needles has some advantages, for example, the weight of the fabric is more evenly distributed, therefore less taxing, on the arms and wrists of the knitter and, the length of the cable may be longer than would be practical with rigid needles since the cable and fabric rest in the lap of the knitter rather than extending straight out past the arms.|$|R

50|$|In <b>flat</b> <b>knitting,</b> {{generally}} stockinette stitch, the hand-knitter knits from right-to-left on {{one side}} of the fabric, turns the work (over), and then purls right-to-left back to the starting position. Usually the smooth side of the fabric is considered the right side, the one facing outwards for viewing; and the side that faces inwards, towards the body, the ridged side, is known as the wrong side. Thus, <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> involves knitting each row on the right side, then purling each row on the wrong side, etc. If each row is knit (no purls) this creates garter stitch, which has the same appearance on both sides and creates horizontal ridges offset by valleys, rather than a knit and purl side. Patterned stitching, such as cables, can be accomplished with either <b>flat</b> <b>knitting,</b> or in the round, however the technique must follow the desired pattern.|$|R

2500|$|The first US {{patent for}} a {{circular}} needle was issued in 1918, although in Europe {{they may have}} been used a little earlier. [...] Circulars are composed of two pointed, straight tips connected by a flexible cable and may be used for both <b>knitting</b> <b>flat</b> or <b>knitting</b> in the round. [...] The two tapered ends, typically 4–5 inches (10.5–13cm) long, are rigid, allowing for easy knitting, and are connected by the flexible strand (usually made of nylon or coated wire). [...] The tips may be permanently connected to the cable and made in overall lengths from [...] to [...] or composed of cables and interchangeable tips. This allows various lengths and diameters to be combined into many different sizes of needles, allowing for a great variety of needs to be met by a relatively few component pieces. [...] The ability to work from either end of one needle is convenient in several types of knitting, such as slip-stitch versions of double knitting.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the areas}} of medical textile is the spacer knitted {{orthopaedic}} products. The concept of compression therapy of orthopaedic supports lies on a simple and efficient mechanical principle – it consists of applying elastic garment around the limb. Spacer orthopaedic supports are <b>knitted</b> on <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> machines equipped with especial elastomeric thread feeder. Compression made by the support depends on the support area, shape and characteristics of knitting. Because of orthopaedic supports are intended for durable wearing and need to vouchsafe compression of fixed value, {{it is very important}} to known how processes acting during exploitation influence alteration of compression values. The aim of this study was to establish the alteration of compression of knitted support during exploitation, i. e. after multifold extension, washing and drying. The samples were <b>knitted</b> on a <b>flat</b> double needle bed knitting machine in combined jacquard-laid-in pattern with elastomeric weft threads. It was established that compressive properties of knits after cyclic tensile load changed slightly, i. e. range between margins of error.

50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>knitting</b> {{is usually}} contrasted with {{circular}} knitting, {{in which the}} fabric is always knitted from the same side. <b>Flat</b> <b>knitting</b> can complicate knitting somewhat compared to circular knitting, since the same stitch (as seen from the right side) is produced by two different movements when knitted from the right and wrong sides. Thus, a knit stitch (as seen from the right side) may be produced by a knit stitch on the right side, or by a purl stitch on the wrong side. This may cause the gauge of the knitting to vary in alternating rows of stockinette fabrics; however, this effect is usually not noticeable, and may be eliminated with practice (the usual way) or by using needles of two different sizes (an unusual and less effective way).|$|R
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to improve the {{mechanical}} properties of the composites with knitted performs by introducing horizontal strands in the course direction in a flat-bed <b>knitting</b> machine. <b>Flat</b> <b>knitted</b> performs were produced with different proportions of axial inlay strands and the composite laminates were prepared using the vacuum-assisted resin transfer moulding technique. It is observed that the introduction of inlay strands influences the structure of the knitted preform by increasing course density, wale density and thickness. This result in the increased anisotropic behaviour of the composite laminate showing increased strength in the course direction and decreased strength in the wale direction. The flexural strength of the knitted preform composites increases in both wale and course directions with the introduction of inlay strands. Laminates from preforms with two inlays exhibit overall improved impact properties whereas those from preforms with one inlay show higher impact damage tolerance index. These observations are explained in terms of the change in fibre architecture brought about by the introduction of the inlay strands...|$|R
