5|$|As {{with all}} of his Brushstrokes works, it is in part a satirical {{response}} to the gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism. Like most of Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dots works it is a depiction of mechanical reproduction via painterly technique. In this case, the satire comes from the <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graphical <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spontaneous painting motion in painstaking painterly detail.|$|E
5|$|The Feast of the Goat {{received}} largely positive reviews, {{with several}} reviewers {{commenting on the}} book's <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between sexuality and power, and on the graphic descriptions of violent events.|$|E

5|$|Girl with Ball was {{exhibited}} at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition and was displayed in Newsweek {{review of the}} show. This work significantly alters the original source and is considered exemplary of Lichtenstein's works that exaggerate the mechanically produced appearance although {{the result of his}} painterly work. It is an enduring <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contemporary beauty figure.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city of Tapiocapolis was {{visually}} {{based on}} the city of Belo Horizonte in Brazil. His depiction of a public sculpture in the city {{was inspired by the}} work of sculptor Marcel Arnould, while the paintings that he designed for the Tapiocapolis hotel in which Tintin and Haddock stay are {{based on the}} work of Serge Poliakoff.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{country was}} also {{influenced}} by American cinema, {{and many of his}} illustrations were based on cinematic imagery. Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier thought that Tintin's arrest of Smiles had been influenced by the Buffalo Bill stories, and that the idea of the gangsters taking Tintin away in their car came from Little Caesar.|$|E

5|$|In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson {{travelled}} to Balaklava, Crimea, {{where they}} took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton's departure. In contrast to Fenton's <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction. They photographed {{the fall of}} Sevastopol in September 1855, producing about 60 images.|$|E
5|$|It is, however, an {{accurate}} <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{room in the}} building known today as Independence Hall, {{the centerpiece of the}} Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Trumbull visited the room, which was where the Second Continental Congress met, when researching for his painting. At the time it was the Pennsylvania State House.|$|E
5|$|Knights and Dames Grand Cross {{are also}} {{entitled}} to receive heraldic supporters.

5|$|Paintings {{and other}} {{pictures}} of the Adoration of the Magi may include a <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star in some form. In the fresco by Giotto di Bondone, it is depicted as a comet. In the tapestry of the subject designed by Edward Burne-Jones (and in the related watercolour), the star is held by an angel.|$|E
5|$|References since antiquity {{are fairly}} rare. At the {{beginning}} of the 17th century, French sculptor Barthélemy Prieur cast a bronze statue Orion et Cédalion, some time between 1600 and 1611. This featured Orion with Cedalion on his shoulder, in a <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient legend of Orion recovering his sight; the sculpture is now displayed at the Louvre.|$|E
5|$|Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri is a {{video game}} in the 4X genre which is {{considered}} a spiritual sequel to the Civilization series. Set in a science fiction <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 22nd century, the game begins as seven competing ideological factions land on the planet Chiron ("Planet") in the Alpha Centauri star system. As the game progresses, Planet's growing sentience becomes a formidable obstacle to the human colonists.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic {{approach}} to Marian art is quite {{distinct from the}} way other Christians (such as the Protestant and the Eastern Orthodox) treat <b>the</b> <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mary. From <b>the</b> very beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Protestant Reformation its leaders expressed their discomfort with <b>the</b> <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> saints in general. While over time a Protestant tradition <b>of</b> art developed, <b>the</b> <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mary within it have remained minimal, given that most Protestants reject Marian veneration and {{view it as a}} Catholic excess.|$|R
5|$|The Utah beach landings, however, were {{relatively}} uncontested, with assault units landing on largely unoccupied beaches and experiencing far less action than the landings at Omaha. The filmmakers chose {{to begin the}} narrative with a <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more dramatic story of Omaha, despite the strategic inaccuracy of an impossible mission that {{could easily have been}} pursued from the other beach area. In addition, one of the most notable of the operational flaws is the <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich as the adversary during the fictional Battle of Ramelle. The 2nd SS was not engaged in Normandy until July, and then at Caen against the British and Canadians, 100 miles east. Furthermore, the Merderet River bridges were not an objective of the 101st Airborne Division but of the 82nd Airborne Division, part of Mission Boston.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} has 52 windows, occupying about 80percent {{of the wall}} space. The east end has a square-framed window of seven lights. It includes a <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nativity made by Clayton and Bell in 1872, and {{was presented to the}} church by the Bath Literary Club.|$|E
5|$|The {{contrast}} between Jacques-Louis David's <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same scene (of Napoleon traversing the Alps {{on his way}} to Italy), which was a flattering portrait that the king of Spain requested for Napoleon (as a gift) and Delaroche's depiction in Bonaparte Crossing the Alps is easily apparent.|$|E
5|$|Western artists often infused Euro-American {{characteristics}} in their <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dogs <b>of</b> Polynesia and possibly many actually depicted the pet dogs kept on European ships rather than native breeds. This resulted in few accurate <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dogs surviving. A few works likely depicting the aboriginal dog breed done by Parkinson, Webber, Alexander Buchan and John Frederick Miller were compiled by American anthropologist Katharine Luomala including the two images above.|$|R

5|$|The <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galero in arms {{can vary}} greatly {{depending}} on the artist's style. The top of the hat may be shown flat or round. Sometimes the brim is shown much narrower; with a domed top it can look like a cappello romano with tassels, but in heraldry it is still called a galero. The tassels may be represented as knotted cords.|$|E
5|$|The play {{deals with}} {{relations}} between Native Americans {{and the first}} European settlers in America. Scholars have debated whether the piece is progressive in its <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natives and have commented that the work reflects an emerging American dramatic and musical sensibility. It served to popularize and romanticize the Pocahontas story as an important American myth.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{pictogram}} is a <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Olympic Torch, {{a representation}} of sporting culture. It was created by Christian French {{as part of the}} Stellar Connections series and its points represent nearby destinations, including the two stadiums.|$|E
