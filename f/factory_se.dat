25|$|Hoidge {{transferred}} to the British Army, taking a commission in the (British) Royal Garrison Artillery (Special Reserve), and {{was attached to the}} Royal Flying Corps, as a second lieutenant on 15 November 1916. He was posted to No. 56 Squadron to fly a Royal Aircraft <b>Factory</b> <b>SE</b> 5 fighter in 1917. He flew this aircraft for all his victories.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{studies on}} {{neutrino}} <b>factories</b> <b>se</b> solenoids at di. erent stages. Often quoted is the adiabatic device,a long solenoid with a slowly decreas- ing. eld sed to capture pions behind the target. In cooling sections as well, design reports show lattices using solenoids with alternating. eld {{to contain the}} beam. This note describes the transverse behaviour of charged parti- cles in a solenoidal. eld. First,a general description of the magnetic. eld is reviewed with emphasis on particular features,s ch as the canonical momen- tum formalism. Then,a complete study of the adiabatic device is presented, along with tracking simulations based on hamiltonian mechanics. Eventu- ally,the case of solenoidal focusing within the short lens approximation is discussed following either the paraxial ray equation approach or the matrix formalism...|$|R
5000|$|The {{fireworks}} {{accident in}} Seest happened on 3 November 2004, when the N. P. Johnsens Fyrværkerifabrik fireworks <b>factory</b> exploded in <b>Seest,</b> {{a suburb of}} Kolding, Denmark. One firefighter died; seven from the rescue team as well as 17 locals were injured. In addition 34 rescuers, 8 police officers and 27 from the Danish Emergency Management Agency were treated for smoke inhalation. The evacuation of 2,000 people from the immediate surrounding area saved many lives. Eight fire and rescue vehicles were also destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|According to the BBC, the era <b>factory</b> farming per <b>se</b> in Britain {{began in}} 1947 {{when a new}} Agriculture Act granted {{subsidies}} to farmers to encourage greater output by introducing new technology, {{in order to reduce}} Britain's reliance on imported meat. The United Nations writes that [...] "intensification of animal production was seen as a way of providing food security." [...] In 1966, the United States, United Kingdom and other industrialized nations, commenced factory farming of beef and dairy cattle and domestic pigs. [...] From its American and West European heartland factory farming became globalised in the later years of the 20th century and is still expanding and replacing traditional practices of stock rearing in an increasing number of countries. In 1990 factory farming accounted for 30% of world meat production and by 2005 this had risen to 40%.|$|R
2500|$|Retired: From 20" [...] racing on May 15, 1977 at the Two Wheeler's/RC Cola Race of Champions {{national}} {{to devote}} more time to his business and promotional career and his associate editorship at Bicycle Motocross Magazine among other commitments, all of which infringed on his racing career. He then started racing a 26-inch Beach Cruiser beginning in 1979. Due largely to the lack of training time incurred because of his responsibilities of running a company and his promotions, he retired altogether from pro racing in May 1983. He himself reclassified an amateur in the ABA's 22–30 and NBL's 25–35 Cruiser Classes. It was joked in the August 1983 issue of BMX Action that they could start figuring out his age by the cruiser class he raced. He raced intermittently in these older amateur cruiser classes in between commitments with his business. He raced in Vet and Hall of Fame races in his spare time. In May 2005 it was announced that Briepthaupt, then at 49 years of age (approximately), would race for SE Bikes (see below in <b>Factory</b> sponsors, professional, <b>SE</b> Bikes).|$|R
