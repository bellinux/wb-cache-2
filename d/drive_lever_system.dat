The use of both roller and friction clutches are discussed and the means for controlling forward, reverse, and braking are included.

5000|$|The most {{complicated}} mechanical aid {{for use with}} extensions is the mechanical <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> nicknamed the machine. This <b>lever</b> <b>system,</b> which superficially resembles the keying mechanism of reed instruments such as the bassoon, mounts levers beside the regular fingerboard (near the nut, on the E-string side), which remotely activate metal [...] "fingers" [...] on the extension fingerboard. The most expensive metal <b>lever</b> <b>systems</b> also give the player the ability to [...] "lock" [...] down notes on the extension fingerboard, as with the wooden [...] "finger" [...] system. One criticism of these devices is that they may lead to unwanted metallic clicking noises.|$|R

40|$|Lever is a {{solid part}} that can turn on a fulcrum. There are three types of fulcrums. The {{efficacy}} of a <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> is measured by mechanical advantage. The first type of lever has the most and third type has the least mechanical advantage. The situation of muscles attachments and direction of forces on teeth in mandible is similar to lever type 3 and therefore, the muscles, bones and teeth can bear occlusal forces. If a destructing contact develops, this <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> will change and cause damaging effects on stomatognathic structures. ...|$|R
50|$|The Chi-Nu used a <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> {{rather than}} a handle system. It had the same engine as the Chi-He, {{producing}} 240 hp and {{a top speed of}} 38.8 km/h.|$|R
25|$|Subsequent {{developments}} included metal strings (introduced post-1891) {{and metal}} tuning pegs (introduced in 1912), additional chromatic strings (introduced from 1925) and a mechanical <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> for rapid re-tuning {{of the instrument}} (first introduced in 1931).|$|R
50|$|A type of {{articulated}} {{steam locomotive}} {{is named after}} Hagans. It had two groups of coupled wheels that moved together and which were connected via swinging <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> (Schwinghebelsystem), so that the locomotive managed with one pair of cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} braking is often {{variable}} {{by means of}} either a knob or a <b>lever</b> <b>system.</b> The support structure is most commonly a base paired with a handle, but recently pole wrappers have been introduced providing a more ergonomic design.|$|R
40|$|The {{bouncing}} {{mechanism of}} human running {{is characterized by}} a shorter duration of the brake after ‘landing’ compared with a longer duration of the push before ‘takeoff’. This landing–takeoff asymmetry has been thought to be a consequence of the force–velocity relation of the muscle, resulting in a greater force exerted during stretching after landing and a lower force developed during shortening before takeoff. However, the asymmetric <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> of the human foot during stance may also be the cause. Here, we measure the landing–takeoff asymmetry in bouncing steps of running, hopping and trotting animals using diverse <b>lever</b> <b>systems.</b> We find that the duration of the push exceeds that of the brake in all the animals, indicating that the different <b>lever</b> <b>systems</b> comply with the basic property of muscle to resist stretching with a force greater than that developed during shortening. In addition, results show both the landing–takeoff asymmetry and the mass-specific vertical stiffness to be greater in small animals than in large animals. We suggest that the landing–takeoff asymmetry is an index of a lack of elasticity, which increases with increasing the role of muscle relative to that of tendon within muscle–tendon units...|$|R

50|$|The {{machines}} were operated initially by a <b>system</b> of <b>levers</b> which operated toggle clutches into the drumshafts. Despite the significant power being transmitted, the <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> was, if set up correctly, relatively {{easy for the}} operator to use. The main control functions were later superseded by pneumatic control.|$|R
40|$|The {{instrument}} has a {{work unit}} detachably coupled to a handle whose distal end {{is provided with}} a tool which is operable by the axial displacement of a rod running through the work unit. The work unit has a rotary connection to a rotary handle which can be turned by the work unit about the instrument's longitudinal axis and relative to a thumb handle, which can be adjusted together with a first operating element relative to the handle, so that the operating element acts on the longer arm of a double-arm <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> which is arranged in a fixed bearing relative to the handle. The shorter arm of the <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> engages in a second axially movable operating element connected to the rod {{in such a way}} that on adjusting the first operating element in a direction, the second operating element is adjusted by the rod in the opposite direction...|$|R

A <b>drive</b> includes <b>drive</b> <b>lever</b> (23), spur gear (22), and rack gears (24, 26) carried on rods (24 a, 26 a) for moving the clamping brackets. A lock includes ratchet gear (40) and pawl (42) biased between lock and unlock positions by a cantilever spring (46, 48) and moved by handle (54). Compliant grip pads (32 b, 34 b) provide compliance to lock, unlock, and hold an object between the clamp brackets...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lever</b> <b>systems</b> {{within a}} {{skeleton}} transmit force with a capacity {{determined by the}} mechanical advantage, A. A is the distance from input force to a joint, divided by {{the distance from the}} joint to the output force. A lever with a relatively high A in static equilibrium has a great capacity to generate force but moves a load over a small distance. Therefore, the geometry of a skeletal lever presents a trade-off between force and speed under quasi-static conditions. The present study considers skeletal dynamics that do not assume static equilibrium by modelling kicking by a locust leg, which is powered by stored elastic energy. This model predicts that the output force of this lever is proportional to A, but its maximum speed is independent of A. Therefore, no trade-off between force and velocity exists in a <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> with spring-mass dynamics. This demonstrates that the motion of a skeleton depends on the major forces that govern its dynamics and cannot be inferred from skeletal geometry alone...|$|R
40|$|Musculoskeletal (MSK) {{systems have}} long been {{compared}} to simple mechanical machines. This not only allows for ease of understanding locomotion, but ease of modeling a biological system during complex motion. More specifically, simple <b>lever</b> <b>systems</b> are most commonly employed to approximate mechanical performance of complex biological <b>systems.</b> Every simple <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> can be characterized by its mechanical advantage, also known as gearing. Through this concept, {{the performance of a}} biological system can be modeled for comparability of theoretical concepts to actual MSK systems. In this thesis, a numerical model of a simple <b>lever</b> <b>system,</b> analogous to a locust leg and fish fin, was developed to understand the effects of mechanical advantage, muscle actuator, and external forces on simple MSK systems. Validation of the numerical model was attempted through the use of an existing McKibben air muscle test fixture. Conditions related to force loading, inertial loading, and viscous loading were tested. The mathematical model showed that the spring-damper in parallel matches the expected results of the Hill’s muscle model, where increases in muscle loading cause decreases in muscle velocity. Further, experimental tests conducted on the existing test fixture employed the addition of two dampers parallel with the McKibben air muscle. The data suggested that for a given damping scenario, under direct loading conditions, there is a maximum potential contractile velocity that could be achieved. Inertial loading tests provided a comparison in the fluid effects where observations illustrate the 100 % glycerine trials caused a greater drag force to dampen the paddle velocity than the room temperature water solution...|$|R

5000|$|The fulcrum head weeder has a split tip like a serpent's tongue, {{and a long}} thin handle. Many {{models have}} a curved piece of metal along the handle which is put against the ground while the tip is digging.

5000|$|Braking was by {{automatic}} Westinghouse {{brakes and}} regulating brakes fitted to the driving wheels. Rheostatic braking was fitted from 12313 onwards, {{which led to}} a more complicated braking sequence. To slow or stop the locomotive, the <b>drive</b> <b>lever</b> had to be returned to the [...] "0" [...] position and the reversing switch changed to Bremen (Brakes). Only then could the driver lever be used in braking mode. In addition, the electric brake was comparatively weak. It was just enough to keep a lone locomotive on the Gotthard southern slope. Braking energy was dissipated via boxes on the roof. A handbrake was also fitted in each cab.|$|R
50|$|Interviews from Merpati {{officials}} {{revealed that}} the first two aircraft had several problems on the Power <b>Lever</b> Lock <b>System,</b> whereas the automatic power <b>lever</b> lock <b>system</b> sometimes failed to open after landing. In May 2008, the board of instructors had agreed to revise the Normal Checklist that the Power Lock system selects to “OPEN” before landing. However, further analysis {{revealed that the}}re were no faults in the engines.|$|R
50|$|Steering was by a cam and <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> which {{provided}} a dual ratio to ease parking. Suspension was all elliptic (overslung in front, underslung at the rear) with rigid beam axles all controlled by Luvax-Girling double acting hydraulic shock absorbers—a transverse torsion bar linking both pairs. Brakes by Girling were mechanical using a wedge and roller system in 11 inch drums with twin leading {{shoes in the}} front drums.|$|R
5000|$|Theoretically, {{a lighter}} frame reduces the {{weight on the}} end of the limbs, making it easier to pick up the legs & move freely across the ground. However, with a lot of speed & impact work, light bone suffers {{concussion}} injury, leading to bucked shins, splints, & stress fractures. Tendons, ligaments, & muscles have less <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> to pull across to effectively use or develop muscle strength for power & stamina.|$|R
40|$|Microforming {{requires}} high-precision motion due to scaling issues. A Terfenol-D transducer {{was considered}} to provide bulk motion for micro-extrusion. Because Terfenol-D cannot practically produce the necessary 2. 5 mm displacement for this micro-extrusion experiment, a <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> was designed to amplify the output displacement. Compliant joints (flexures) were used to replace conventional bearings, resulting in a flexible, solid-state lever mechanism. By eliminating the backlash and static friction associated with conventional bearings, {{it should be possible}} to improve displacement precision as required to meet the geometric tolerance demands of microforming. A chief concern when designing flexure joints that see large amounts of axial loading is compliance, which leads to not only loss of motion but also loss of accuracy as the <b>lever</b> <b>system</b> responds differently under different loads. However, because Terfenol-D already has load-dependent response, this loss of accuracy is moot when coupled with a Terfenol-D prime mover, as it already requires load-dependent control. Preliminary FEM analysis has shown this design to have lever ratio losses of approximately 4 % from half load to full load, with lower than predicted stress...|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, if the {{position}} of the fulcrum on lever AA' were moved so that A1 = 4 units and A2 = 9 units, then the mechanical advantage W/F is calculated as [...] = 1, meaning that an applied force will lift an equivalent weight and there is no mechanical advantage. This is not usually the goal of a compound <b>lever</b> <b>system,</b> though in rare situations the geometry may suit a specific purpose.|$|R

50|$|The Valiant AP6 was {{released}} in March 1965, replacing the Chrysler Valiant AP5. The basic styling was carried over from the AP5 but differed in having a new split grille, a new bonnet and new front mudguards. Mechanical changes included a redesigned camshaft, the introduction of self-adjusting brakes and {{the replacement of the}} push button gear selector on models with automatic transmission by a traditional <b>lever</b> <b>system.</b> Optional power brakes were made available across the range.|$|R
50|$|Boosters may {{be driven}} by an {{electric}} motor, hydraulics, low or high pressure air or manually by a <b>lever</b> <b>system.</b> Those powered by compressed air are usually linear actuated systems, where a pneumatic cylinder directly drives the compression piston, often in a common housing, separated by a seal. A high pressure pneumatic drive arrangement may use the same pressure as the output pressure to drive the piston, and a low pressure drive will use a larger diameter piston to multiply the applied force.|$|R
