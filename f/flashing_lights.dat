5|$|The video {{begins with}} Usher {{flickering}} {{on a television}} in a room, before we see him in a scene dancing with blue <b>flashing</b> <b>lights,</b> and will.i.am. is shown in a similar room with red <b>flashing</b> <b>lights.</b> Usher is then shown with female background dancers in a white room. In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens. Usher then dances outside {{in front of a}} concrete wall, with male background dancers appearing as shadows. As will.i.am. performs his verse, he and Usher are seen in their corresponding rooms with <b>flashing</b> <b>lights.</b> After this, Usher puffs a cigar and dances with male background dancers in an arena-like area, whilst he is also joined by female dancers with <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> on the floor, with the video ending with Usher shown on the flashing television.|$|E
5|$|Later {{studies showed}} that 5–10% of the viewers had mild {{symptoms}} that did not need hospital treatment. Twelve thousand children who did not get sent to hospital by ambulance reported mild symptoms of illness; however, their symptoms more closely resembled mass hysteria than a grand mal seizure. A study following 103 patients over {{three years after the}} event found that most of them had no further seizures. Scientists believe that the <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> triggered photosensitive seizures in which visual stimuli such as <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> can cause altered consciousness. Although approximately 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by this Pokémon episode was unprecedented.|$|E
5|$|About 6% {{of those}} with {{epilepsy}} have seizures that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures. Those with reflex epilepsy have seizures that are only triggered by specific stimuli. Common triggers include <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> and sudden noises. In certain types of epilepsy, seizures happen more often during sleep, and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping.|$|E

5000|$|Compared {{with other}} types of warning devices, the {{effectiveness}} of the embedded pavement <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> system seem to be high. When approaching a crosswalk with an embedded pavement <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> system, drivers are more apt to slow down and yield to pedestrians than when drivers approach a crosswalk with another type of lighted warning device. Also, compared to a crosswalk with no warning device, drivers are more likely to slow down and yield to pedestrians when the embedded pavement <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> system is in place.|$|R
5|$|An {{international}} {{version of}} the video was also officially released. This version is {{almost exactly the same}} as the original, with the only difference being that some early shots were Spears dances in front of the multicolored background are replaced by shots of Spears with a short blonde bob wig wearing a purple dress and in front of a black background with <b>flashing</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{companies}} {{followed with}} their own bubble light versions and other lighting novelties. In 1946, Sylvania introduced fluorescent pastel lights. In 1955, NOMA manufactured <b>flashing</b> <b>lights.</b> In 1958, GE launched Lighted Ice Bulbs, blue bulbs covered with 'ice' crystals. Fairy Lights were imported from Europe in 1950 and eventually morphed into the inexpensive mini-lights popular in the last decades of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|A {{working group}} {{produced}} a 34-page report with recommendations following the official inquiry, which {{was approved by}} the Jockey Club. Considerable public discussion had arisen over the possibility of introducing electronic devices, such as horns or <b>flashing</b> <b>lights,</b> to provide a fail-safe starting and recall system. The use of modern technology however was dismissed {{on the basis of a}} lack of total success overseas, and being open to sabotage and technical failure.|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{a new way}} to {{fabricate}} nanoporous TiO 2 photoanode by <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> is demonstrated. TiO 2 nanoparticles are sintered on FTO glass by <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> irradiation at room temperature in ambient condition, which is dramatically simple, ultrahigh speed and one-shot large area fabrication process compared to a conventional high temperature (120 °C) thermal sintering process. The effect of the <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> conditions (<b>flash</b> <b>light</b> energy, pulse numbers and pulse duration) on the nanostructures of sintered TiO 2 layer, was studied and discussed using several microscopic and spectroscopic characterization techniques such as SEM, FT-IR, XRD and XPS. The sintered TiO 2 photoanodes by <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> were used in DSSC and its performance were compared with that of DSSC fabricated by conventional thermal sintering process. It was found that a <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> sintered TiO 2 photoanode has efficiency which {{is similar to that of}} the thermal sintered photoanode. It is expected that the newly developed <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> sintering technique of TiO 2 nanoparticles would be a strong alternative to realize the room temperature and in-situ sintering of photoanode fabrication for outdoor solar cell fabrication.

5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks the cab driver {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks the driver to turn up the air conditioner because he's hot, but the driver turns up the music instead, while wearing a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits the cab and arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside the main room of the club filled with <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> and people dancing while wearing animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> and speakers in the background.|$|E
5|$|To {{prevent any}} similar {{incidents}} from reoccurring, Nintendo quickly ordered the episode pulled, {{and it has}} not aired since, not even outside Japan. Maddie Blaustein, the English dub voice of Meowth, said twice on the Serebii.net forums that this episode was dubbed in the United States by 4Kids Entertainment. On the other hand, Veronica Taylor, the English voice of Ash, claimed that this episode was never dubbed and will not be dubbed, though this was contradicted again on September 25, 2016, when Eric Stuart, the English dub voice of Brock and James, said that 4Kids did indeed dub the episode. Regardless, any plans to release this episode outside Japan were abandoned after Nintendo objected, and it was never broadcast anywhere else in the world. Coincidentally, the episode aired around the same time Pokémon was being adapted for American audiences. 4Kids Entertainment's dub took extra precaution in bright and <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> in the show, using the post-1997 versions altering lighting and the frequency of <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> for earlier episodes of their American release.|$|E

5|$|To reduce costs, no alien {{spacecraft}} is seen at {{the start}} of the film; instead, Kator's arrival is conveyed solely by <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> and sound effects. As the low budget also precluded the use of an orchestra, composer Ivor Slaney devised a synthesised score featuring occasional contributions from traditional instruments (such as a piano) that he recorded himself. Slaney also composed for Warren's next film, Terror (1978). The soundtracks for Prey and Terror were released jointly on CD in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Electrification of the Melbourne {{suburban}} {{network was}} also carried out, {{with the first}} train running in 1919. By 1924 210,000 passengers passed through the main city terminal of Flinders Street station per weekday. St Kilda was Melbourne's busiest suburban station with 4½ million journeys, followed by Footscray with almost 4 million, then Elsternwick, Ascot Vale, Essendon and Balaclava. Technology advancements continued, with 3 position automatic signals introduced in 1915, the conversion of screw couplings to knuckle couplers from 1924, and the first remote controlled signalling provided in 1925. The first level crossing <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> were installed at Mentone on Moorabin Road in 1932.|$|E
5|$|In most countries, winter service {{vehicles}} usually have amber light bars, which are activated {{to indicate that}} the vehicle is operating below the local speed limit or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by straddling lanes or by spreading grit or de-icer. In some areas, such as the Canadian province of Ontario, winter {{service vehicles}} use the blue <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> associated with emergency service vehicles, rather than the amber or orange used elsewhere. Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast orange or yellow to allow the vehicles to be seen more clearly in whiteout conditions.|$|E

Upon 'waking up', he does not have any memory of what happened while hypnotized, but sees that the woman and his son Ben (Charlie Tahan), a young musical prodigy, are missing. Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) reveals that similar cases have ended with the victims being returned, but left insane from the trauma of the incident. All the victims were academics and accomplished in their respective fields.|$|E
5|$|Though {{breeding}} can {{be improved}} by supplementary feeding, the survival of young kakapo is hampered {{by the presence of}} Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using traps and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small video camera and infra-red light source watch the nest continuously, and will scare approaching rats with <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> and loud popping sounds. To increase the success rate of nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones.|$|E

40|$|In this work, multiwalled carbon {{nanotubes}} (MWNTs) {{were employed}} to improve the conductivity and fatigue resistance of <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> sintered copper nanoparticle (NP) ink films. The effect of CNT weight fraction on the <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> sintering and the fatigue characteristics of Cu NP/CNT composite films were investigated. The effect of carbon nanotube length was also studied with regard to enhancing the conductivity and fatigue resistance of <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> sintered Cu NP/CNT composite films. The <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> irradiation energy was optimized to obtain high conductivity Cu NP/CNT composite films. Cu NP/CNT composite films fabricated via optimized <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> irradiation had the lowest resistivity (7. 86 mu Omega center dot cm), which was only 4. 6 times {{higher than that of}} bulk Cu films (1. 68 mu Omega center dot cm).
