5000|$|The {{function}} of the Duvernoy's gland has {{been the source of}} much study and speculation, and debate is still ongoing. It is widely recognized that the Duvernoy’s gland is the homologue of venom glands in vipers and elapids. However, the two types of glands are also “anatomically and functionally distinct,” leading experts such as Dr. Kenneth Kardong to maintain the distinction between the Duvernoy’s gland and venom glands. Other scientists such as Dr. Bryan Fry maintain that the Duvernoy gland is a primitive version of a venom gland and should be referred to as such. Dr. Stephen Mackessy suggests Duvernoy’s gland does secrete venom and is homologous to the venom gland found in <b>front-fanged</b> <b>snakes.</b>|$|E
40|$|Snake venoms {{have been}} {{subjected}} to increasingly sensitive analyses for well over 100 years, but most research has been restricted to <b>front-fanged</b> <b>snakes,</b> which actually represent a relatively small proportion of extant species of advanced snakes. Because rear-fanged snakes are a diverse and distinct radiation of the advanced snakes, understanding venom composition among “colubrids” is critical to understanding the evolution of venom among snakes. Here we review the state of knowledge concerning rear-fanged snake venom composition, emphasizing those toxins for which protein or transcript sequences are available. We have also added new transcriptome-based data on venoms of three species of rear-fanged snakes. Based on this compilation, it is apparent that several components, including cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRiSPs), C-type lectins (CTLs), CTLs-like proteins and snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), are broadly distributed among “colubrid” venoms, while others, notably three-finger toxins (3 FTxs), appear nearly restricted to the Colubridae (sensu stricto). Some putative new toxins, such as snake venom matrix metalloproteinases, are in fact present in several colubrid venoms, while others are only transcribed, at lower levels. This work provides insights into the evolution of these toxin classes, but because {{only a small number of}} species have been explored, generalizations are still rather limited. It is likely that new venom protein families await discovery, particularly among those species with highly specialized diets...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIPhilodryas chamissonis is a rear-fanged snake {{endemic to}} Chile. Its bite {{produces}} {{mild to moderate}} symptoms with proteolytic and anti-coagulant effects. Presently, {{the composition of the}} venom, as well as, the biochemical and structural characteristics of its toxins, remains unknown. In this study, we cloned and reported the first full-length sequences of five toxin-encoding genes from the venom gland of this species: Type III snake venom metalloprotease (SVMP), snake venom serine protease (SVSP), Cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP), alpha and beta subunits of C-type lectin-like protein (CLP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (NP). These genes are highly expressed in the venom gland and their sequences exhibited a putative signal peptide, suggesting that these are components of the venom. These putative toxins had different evolutionary relationships with those reported for some <b>front-fanged</b> <b>snakes,</b> being SVMP, SVSP and CRISP of P. chamissonis closely related to the toxins present in Elapidae species, while NP was more related to those of Viperidae species. In addition, analyses suggest that the alpha and beta subunits of CLP of P. chamissonis might have a alpha-subunit scaffold in common with Viperidae species, whose highly variable C-terminal region might have allowed the diversification in a and (I subunits. Our results provide the first molecular description of the toxins possibly implicated in the envenomation of prey and humans by the bite of P. chamissonis.

50|$|The Sea Snake Specialist Group (SSSG) is {{concerned}} with the marine snakes of the elapid subfamilies Hydrophiinae and Laticaudinae, 62 species of true seasnakes, and eight species of sea kraits respectively. All are <b>front-fanged</b> venomous <b>snakes</b> with paddle-shaped tails. A number of species exhibit extremely localised ranges, whilst others are widely distributed. Some are harvested heavily for the snake-skin trade or food.|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{the last}} decade {{combining}} transcriptomics with established proteomics methods have made possible rapid identification and quantification of protein families in snake venoms. Although over 100 studies have been published, the value of this information is increased when it is collated, allowing rapid assimilation and evaluation of evolutionary trends, geographical variation, and possible medical implications. This review brings together all compositional studies of snake venom proteomes published {{in the last}} decade. Compositional studies were identified for 132 snake species: 42 from 360 (12 %) Elapidae (elapids), 20 from 101 (20 %) Viperinae (true vipers), 65 from 239 (27 %) Crotalinae (pit vipers), and five species of non-front-fanged snakes. Approximately 90 % of their total venom composition consisted of eight protein families for elapids, 11 protein families for viperines and ten protein families for crotalines. There were four dominant protein families: phospholipase A 2 s (the most common across all <b>front-fanged</b> <b>snakes),</b> metalloproteases, serine proteases and three-finger toxins. There were six secondary protein families: cysteine-rich secretory proteins, l-amino acid oxidases, kunitz peptides, C-type lectins/snaclecs, disintegrins and natriuretic peptides. Elapid venoms contained mostly three-finger toxins and phospholipase A 2 s and viper venoms metalloproteases, phospholipase A 2 s and serine proteases. Although 63 protein families were identified, more than half were present in < 5 % of snake species studied and always in low abundance. The importance of these minor component proteins remains unknown...|$|E
40|$|Australia is the {{stronghold of}} the <b>front-fanged</b> venomous <b>snake</b> family Elapidae. The Australasian elapid snake radiation, which {{includes}} approximately 100 terrestrial species in Australia, {{as well as}} Melanesian species and all the world's true sea snakes, may be less than 12 million years old [...] The incredible phenotypic and ecological diversity of the clade is matched by considerable diversity in venom composition. The clade’s evolutionary youth and dynamic evolution should make it {{of particular interest to}} toxinologists, however, the majority of species, which are small, typically inoffensive, and seldom encountered by non-herpetologists, have been almost completely neglected by researchers. The present study investigates the venom composition of 28 species proteomically, revealing several interesting trends in venom composition, and reports, {{for the first time in}} elapid snakes, the existence of an ontogenetic shift in the venom composition and activity of brown snakes (Pseudonaja sp.). Trends in venom composition are compared to the snakes’ feeding ecology and the paper concludes with an extended discussion of the selection pressures shaping the evolution of snake venom...|$|R
