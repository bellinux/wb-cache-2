2500|$|Both {{the upper}} {{southwest}} and northeast sideslopes of Bennett Valley have significant oak woodland. [...] Both forested areas have dominant trees that include coast live oak. [...] On the lower slopes and northern valley floor there are considerable numbers of valley oak in relict stands, {{from a previous}} dominant cover of these lower elevations prior to agricultural development of the valley floor. According to the 1990 report of Earth Metrics, {{a large percentage of}} valley oaks near Bennett Valley Road at the northwest end of Bennett Valley were infested with oak apple gall. [...] Gall wasps of the family Cynipidae produce a single sexual generation within a structure that resembles an apple. [...] Some valley oaks on the site are infested with these [...] "fruits," [...] and on first glance appear as apple trees. [...] This infestation is considered mild, and should not affect the oaks' ability to survive. [...] Some valley oaks in this area were also noticeably infested with <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> in the 1990 survey. [...] This facultative epiphytic parasite can lead to the detriment of oak trees if allowed to persist and spread among trees ...|$|E
50|$|Arceuthobium campylopodum is {{a species}} of <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> known as western <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe.</b> It is native to the low to {{moderate}} elevation coniferous forests of western North America. It is a common parasite of several species of pine tree, including Jeffrey Pine, Ponderosa Pine, and Coulter Pine. The <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> is a greenish-yellow structure above the bark of the tree, {{while most of the}} plant is beneath the bark. Seeds mature during the fall and disperse to nearby trees.|$|E
50|$|Witch's broom may {{be caused}} by many {{different}} types of organisms, including fungi, oomycetes, insects, <b>mistletoe,</b> <b>dwarf</b> mistletoes, mites, nematodes, phytoplasmas, or viruses. The broom growths may last for many years, typically {{for the life of the}} host plant. Human activity is sometimes behind the introduction of these organisms, for example, by failing to observe hygienic practice and thereby infecting the tree with the causative organism, or by pruning a tree improperly, and thereby weakening it.|$|R
50|$|Arceuthobium americanum is {{a species}} of <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> known as American <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> and lodgepole-pine <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe.</b> It is a common plant of western North America where it lives in high {{elevation}} pine forests. It is a parasitic plant which lives upon the Lodgepole Pine, particularly the subspecies Pinus contortus ssp. murrayana, the Tamarack Pine. This pine subspecies is most common in the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada. The American <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> is a yellow-green coral-shaped structure above {{the surface of the}} tree's bark, while most of the parasite is beneath the bark. The seeds mature in late summer and disperse to nearby trees. This species has been found to explosively-disperse its seeds through thermogenesis.|$|E

50|$|Arceuthobium douglasii is {{a species}} of <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> known as Douglas-fir <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe.</b> It is native to western North America from British Columbia to Texas to California, where it lives in forest and {{woodland}} as a parasite. It is found mostly on Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees but occasionally on fir (Abies spp.) as well.|$|E
50|$|Korthalsella salicornioides or <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> is an endemic {{parasitic}} plant in New Zealand.|$|E
5000|$|Eastern <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> parasitizes several genera of {{conifers}} including spruces, pines, firs and larches.|$|E
5000|$|Some Plateau Indian tribes used western <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> as a wash {{to prevent}} dandruff.|$|E
5000|$|Arceuthobium pusillum is a perennial, obligate {{parasitic}} {{plant in the}} sandalwood family. Its common names include <b>Dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> or Eastern <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe.</b> It {{is one of the}} most widespread dwarf mistletoes within its range which covers the eastern United States and Canada, from Saskatchewan to Nova Scotia and New Jersey. The species name [...] "pusillum" [...] derives from Latin [...] "pusillus", meaning very small.|$|E
50|$|In western forest {{ecosystems}} of North America, numerous <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> species {{are considered to}} be serious forest-borne disease agents. Severe <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> infection can result in a reduction in tree growth, premature tree mortality, reduced seed and cone development, reduced wood quality, and increase the susceptibility of the host tree to pathogen and/or insect attack. Most of the commercially important conifers in western North America are parasitized by one or more dwarf mistletoes.|$|E
50|$|Arceuthobium oxycedri, juniper <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe,</b> is a hemiparasite of the Santalaceae family. It parasitizes {{members of}} the Juniperus genus, {{especially}} Juniperus oxycedrus and Juniperus communis.|$|E
50|$|Her {{research}} group showed—in a Nature Communications paper—that the parasitic flowering plant Arceuthobium americanum (Lodegpole pine <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe)</b> undergoes thermogenesis (internal heat generation) to explosively-discharge its seeds.|$|E
5000|$|Arceuthobium littorum is {{a species}} of <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> known as coastal <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe.</b> It is endemic to the {{coastline}} of northern California, where it lives as a parasite on Bishop Pine and Monterey Pine trees. This is a dark brown or greenish shrub which is visible as a network of scaly stems extending above the bark of its host tree. Most of the mistletoe is located inside the host tree, attached to it via haustoria, which tap the tree for water and nutrients. The leaves of the mistletoe are reduced to scales on its surface.|$|E
50|$|Injury {{caused by}} <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> is {{manifested}} {{in a variety}} of ways: reduction in tree growth, distortion of growth, reduction in wood quality, predisposition of trees to secondary attack, and reduction in seed yield.|$|E
50|$|Lucy Bishop Millington (June 10, 1825 - January 17, 1900) was an American self-taught {{botanist}} {{known for}} her discovery of Arceuthobium pusillum, a species of <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> that was damaging trees in New York State.|$|E
50|$|Abert's {{squirrel}} typically builds its nest in {{the branches}} of the ponderosa pine in groups of twigs infected with <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe.</b> They are strictly diurnal. Abert's squirrel does not store food, as other North American squirrels do.|$|E
5000|$|Arceuthobium spp. are {{considered}} to be a very serious pest in northern American forests. Unlike the other mistletoes in the Loranthaceae and Viscaceae families, the dwarf mistletoes have very reduced photosynthetic capability and draw heavily on the host for carbohydrates and diminish the amounts of carbohydrates and energy available to the host. The <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> also has a girdling effect on the stem which is infected, meaning that there is an accumulation of sugars distal to the infection which limits the flow of sugars and other chemicals, including hormones, needed by the roots, resulting in die back of the tree. [...] Due to cytokinins not being transported properly, witches broom my result on the infected trees. The combined effects of <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> distort and suppress the growth of branches and effect the main trunk by causing swellings, knots, or structural weakening.|$|E
50|$|A. pusillum is {{considered}} the most damaging disease in black spruce in the Great Lakes region. <b>Dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> also causes major trunk swellings on red spruce, significantly reducing {{the value of the}} lumber; these swellings are not common on black spruce, perhaps {{due to the fact that}} black spruce is a much shorter-lived species.|$|E
50|$|Thermogenesis is {{the process}} of heat {{production}} in organisms. It occurs in all warm-blooded animals, and also in a few species of thermogenic plants such as the Eastern skunk cabbage, the Voodoo lily, and the giant water lilies of the genus Victoria. The lodgepole pine <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe,</b> Arceuthobium americanum disperses its seeds explosively through thermogenesis.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} control measure after planting is to manage for reduced tree stress. This includes regulating species composition, maintaining biological diversity, {{and reducing the}} chances for insect pest buildup. Mixed-species forests are more resistant to insect defoliation, and also slow the spread of species-specific pests such as <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe,</b> which are both predisposing agents for Armillaria.|$|E
50|$|Arceuthobium abietinum is {{a species}} of <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> known as fir <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe.</b> It is native to western North America from Washington to New Mexico to {{northern}} Mexico, where it lives in coniferous forests as a parasite on various species of fir, particularly white fir, giant fir, and red fir. This is a small shrub which is visible as a network of scaly yellowish stems extending above the bark of its host tree. Most of the mistletoe is located inside the host tree, attached to it via haustoria, which tap the tree for water and nutrients. The leaves of the mistletoe are reduced to knobby scales on its surface. It is dioecious, with male and female mistletoe plants producing spikes of staminate and pistillate flowers, respectively. The fruit is a sticky berry a few millimeters long which explodes to disperse the seeds it contains several meters away from the parent plant and its host tree.|$|E
50|$|Arceuthobium divaricatum is {{a species}} of <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> known as pinyon <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe.</b> It is native to the southwestern United States and Baja California, where it lives in {{woodlands}} as a parasite on various species of pine, particularly Colorado Pinyon and Single-leaf Pinyon. This is a small shrub which is visible as a network of scaly brown or greenish stems no more than 12 centimeters long extending above the bark of its host tree. Most of the mistletoe is located inside the host tree, attached to it via haustoria, which tap the tree for water and nutrients. The leaves of the mistletoe are reduced to thin scales on its surface. It is dioecious, with male and female mistletoe plants producing spikes of staminate and pistillate flowers, respectively. The fruit is a sticky berry a few millimeters long which explodes to disperse the seeds it contains several meters away from the parent plant and its host tree.|$|E
5000|$|They are dioecious, {{individual}} plants being either male or female. The {{fruit is}} unusual in that it builds up hydrostatic pressure internally when ripe and shoots the single sticky seed up to speeds nearly 50 mph, an example of rapid plant movement. The lodgepole pine <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe,</b> Arceuthobium americanum, {{has been found to}} explosively-disperse its seeds through thermogenesis. [...] <b>Dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> seeds are enveloped in a hygroscopic, glue-like substance called viscin. Many fail to land on a suitable hosts shoot, but some succeed, and in this way they are spread through the forests as a pest front. The spread of dwarf mistletoes in forest stands is greatest from the overstory to the understory, due to gravity. Advantageous stand conditions for the spread of dwarf mistletoes include an uneven-aged stand structure with severely infected hosts in dominant and codominant crown classes, species composition dominated by the primary host, and tree densities that are between 175 - 500 trees/ha.|$|E
50|$|In {{its native}} range, Monterey pine is {{associated}} with a characteristic flora and fauna. It is the co-dominant canopy tree together with Cupressus macrocarpa which naturally occurs only in coastal Monterey County. Furthermore, one of the pine forests in Monterey, California, was the discovery site for Hickman's potentilla, an endangered species. Piperia yadonii, a rare species of orchid is endemic to the same pine forest adjacent to Pebble Beach. In its native range, Monterey pine is a principal host for the <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> Arceuthobium littorum.|$|E
50|$|Eastern <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> is a hemiparasitic plant which grows {{inside the}} stems {{of a host}} plant. Once a seed lands on a branch it will {{germinate}} and grow a haustorium which penetrates past the cambium layer and into the host's xylem and phloem tissues; from those tissues it gathers nutrients needed for its own growth and reproduction. Until the mistletoe grows aerial stems it will be completely reliant on the host for all nutrients and energy; even after it grows aerial stems it will still not produce enough energy to support itself and will still be still reliant on the host.|$|E
50|$|Phoradendron tomentosum, {{the leafy}} {{mistletoe}}, hairy mistletoe or Christmas mistletoe, is a plant parasite. It {{is characterized by}} its larger leaves and smaller berries than <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe.</b> Leafy mistletoe seldom kill but they do rob their hosts of moisture and some minerals, causing stress during drought and reducing crop productions on fruit and nut trees. Leafy mistletoe {{has the ability to}} photosynthesize on its own but it relies on other plants in order to obtain its nutrients. It attaches itself to a tree and then grows haustoria, {{in order to get the}} food and water it needs.|$|E
5000|$|A {{standardized}} {{system called}} the Hawksworth 6-class mistletoe rating system (DMR) has been devised {{to determine how}} much <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> has infected a tree. To use this system, the living part of the tree crown (botany) needs to be broken up into 3 sections, (top, middle, bottom). Each section is then rated either 0, 1, or 2 with a score of 0 being assigned for a uninfected section, 1 for light infection with {{less than half of the}} branches infected, or 2 for heavy infection with over half of the branches infected. The 3 numbers are then added together to give the total rating for the tree.|$|E
5000|$|Mature or [...] "old-growth" [...] Douglas fir {{forest is}} the primary habitat of the red tree vole (Arborimus longicaudus) and the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). Home range {{requirements}} for breeding pairs of spotted owls are at least 400 ha (4 km2) of old-growth. Red tree voles may {{also be found in}} immature forests if Douglas fir is a significant component. This animal nests almost exclusively in the foliage of Douglas fir trees. Nests are located 2 - 50 m above the ground. The red vole's diet consists chiefly of Douglas fir needles. A parasitic plant sometimes utilizing P. menziesii is Douglas-fir <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> (Arceuthobium douglasii).|$|E
50|$|Western tanager may {{associate}} with or avoid some plant species. For example, in mixed-wood forests in Alberta western tanager was significantly (p=0.1) {{positively associated with}} conifer density (number/ha). Western tanager was also considered a conifer-associated species in quaking aspen-dominated and mixed quaking aspen-conifer communities in British Columbia. It is suggested that western tanager's preference for multi-stored habitats in the Black Hills {{may be related to}} the bur oak and quaking aspen/paper birch mid-story. Western tanager was not significantly (p=0.184) related with abundance of pineland <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> (Arceuthobium vaginatum ssp. cryptopodum) in ponderosa pine stands in central Colorado. Western tanager was negatively associated with subalpine fir (A. lasiocarpa) cover in northern Rocky Mountain conifer forests.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to host-water dependence, dwarf mistletoes must acquire carbohydrate and mineral nutrition from their hosts. Dwarf mistletoes have both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b and the necessary mechanisms for photosynthesis, but chlorophyll concentrations in dwarf mistletoes are approximately 1/5 to 1/10 of {{those found in}} their host’s foliage, and dwarf mistletoes have low photosynthetic rates {{as measured by the}} rate of carbon fixation. The principal carbohydrate transported from the host to <b>dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> is sucrose. Dwarf mistletoes are phloem deficient; therefore, dwarf mistletoes draw carbohydrates from their hosts by connections to the host phloem and ray parenchyma. The rate of carbohydrate transport between dwarf mistletoes varies according to season, but dwarf mistletoes continuously draw carbohydrates from their hosts throughout the year.|$|E

50|$|After 2-12 {{years from}} the start of the {{infection}} the mistletoe will grow aerial stems outside of the stem it inhabits, these stems are often inconspicuous at 0.5 - 3 cm. The stems may pale yellow green and the male stems may be red or red-brown. <b>Dwarf</b> <b>mistletoe</b> is dioecious,with distinct male and female plants: the male (staminate) flowers are 2mm across and mostly trimerous (having 3 petals or sepals) but may be 2-4-merous. The mature fruits are green, 1.5-3mm sized berry. Seeds ripen in the autumn and the fruits forcefully eject seeds which are coated in a sticky substance that allows them to adhere to whatever they touch. After rain, the sticky seed will slide down a needle that it has landed on onto a stem where it will then germinate and enter into the host. The seeds may spread long distances via animals.|$|E
