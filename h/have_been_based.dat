5|$|A {{number of}} pubs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> on Great Marlborough Street for centuries. The Coach and Horses at No.1 and the Marlborough Head at Nos.37–38 were both {{established}} in the 1730s. However, most of the 18th century buildings on Great Marlborough Street were later demolished, {{which led to the}} decline of its reputation as a fashionable street.|$|E
5|$|Anwar {{is thought}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> on the poet Chairil Anwar, an individualistic anarchist known for being abrasive, having kleptomania, and womanizing. The poet's friend Nasjah Djamin notes that the {{characterization}} captured the real-life Anwar's nonchalance, impoliteness, and arrogance.|$|E

5|$|Somari was {{developed}} by the homebrew developer Hummer Team. Very {{little is known about the}} game's origins; it is theorized to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> upon extracted source code from the original game and its sequel that was back-ported to the NES. The title has caught the attention of contemporary video game journalists, who have commented upon its accurate recreation of the original game.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his later}} works, {{following}} in his traditional sketches {{about his life}} and people he has met, were Hurry-Graphs (1851), Out-Doors at Idlewild (1854), and Ragbag (1855). Willis had complained that his magazine writing prevented him from writing a longer work. He finally had the time in 1856, and he wrote his only novel, Paul Fane, which was published a year later. The character Bosh Blivins, who served as comic relief in the novel, may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> on painter Chester Harding. His final work was The Convalescent (1859), which included a chapter on his time spent with Washington Irving at Sunnyside.|$|E
5|$|Chaucer's Criseyde is {{swayed by}} Diomedes playing on her fear. Pandarus is now her uncle, more worldly-wise and {{more active in}} what happens and so Troilus is more passive. This {{passivity}} is given comic treatment when Troilus passes out in Criseyde's bedroom and is lifted into her bed by Pandarus. Troilus' repeated emotional paralysis is {{comparable to that of}} Hamlet who may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> on him. It can be seen as driven by loyalty both to Criseyde and to his homeland, but has also been interpreted less kindly.|$|E

5|$|Copernicium {{was first}} created on February 9, 1996, at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, by Sigurd Hofmann, Victor Ninov et al. This element {{was created by}} firing {{accelerated}} zinc-70 nuclei at a target made of lead-208 nuclei in a heavy ion accelerator. A single atom (a second was reported but was found to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> on data fabricated by Ninov) of copernicium was produced with a mass number of 277.|$|E
5|$|Despite Mitică's {{association}} with Bucharest and his usual most common {{career as a}} state employee, several commentators have recounted that he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> on Gheorghe Matheescu, an entrepreneur {{from the town of}} Sinaia (located on the Prahova Valley, in northern Muntenia). Matheescu took pride in this supposed connection, and, around 1939, argued in its favor in front of literary historian Şerban Cioculescu. Cioculescu recorded the rumor, and indicated that it was backed by information received from Caragiale's daughter, Ecaterina Logadi. Her father reportedly enjoyed Matheescu's company, and, in 1901, even authored short advertisements for his store.|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages tales {{originating}} from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore—the Arthurian myth. These {{were derived from}} Anglo-Norman, Welsh and French sources, featuring King Arthur, Camelot, Excalibur, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table such as Lancelot. These stories are most centrally brought together within Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). Another early figure from British tradition, King Cole, may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> on a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain. Many of the tales and pseudo-histories make up part of the wider Matter of Britain, a collection of shared British folklore.|$|E

5|$|Given that Gadge is {{revealed}} {{to actually be}} a witch, Howick asked Shearsmith whether the former's character, Thomas, truly had witnessed Gadge engaging {{in some kind of}} supernatural activity. Shearsmith suggested that Thomas was motivated by greed. However, he begins to regret his choice when he witnesses Gadge being tortured. Pemberton, though, noted that the real-life accusations of witchcraft must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> on some level of belief.|$|E
5|$|Leif {{was the son}} of Erik the Red and {{his wife}} Thjodhild, and the {{grandson}} of Thorvaldr Ásvaldsson, and distant relative of Naddodd, who discovered Iceland. He was a Viking in the early days. His year of birth is most often given as c. 970 or c. 980. Though Leif's birthplace is not accounted for in the sagas, it is likely he was born in Iceland, where his parents met—probably somewhere on the edge of Breiðafjörður, and possibly at the farm Haukadal where Thjóðhild's family is said to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based.</b> Leif had two brothers, whose names were Thorsteinn and Thorvaldr, and a sister, Freydís.|$|E
5|$|Many {{hypothetical}} extinct macaws {{were based}} only on contemporaneous accounts, but these species are considered dubious today. Several of them were named in the early 20th century by Rothschild, who {{had a tendency to}} name species based on little tangible evidence. Among others, the red-headed macaw (Ara erythrocephala) and the Jamaican red macaw (Ara gossei) were named for accounts of macaws on Jamaica, and the Dominican green-and-yellow macaw (Ara atwoodi) was supposedly from Dominica island. The violet macaw (Anodorhynchus purpurascens), which was named for accounts of blue parrots supposedly from Guadeloupe, is now thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> on references to the Guadeloupe amazon (Amazona violacea).|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{traditional}} history of the Fairy Flag is preserved in manuscript form. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, Fred T. MacLeod noted one manuscript written around 1800, which he considered to be the most detailed description of the flag. Another source of the flag's traditional history is the Bannatyne manuscript, which documents {{the traditional}} history of Clan MacLeod. It dates to the 1830s, however, it is thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> upon earlier traditions.|$|E
5|$|Naming {{groups of}} organisms {{in a way}} that is clear and widely agreed is important, as some {{disputes}} in paleontology <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> just on misunderstandings over names. Linnaean taxonomy is commonly used for classifying living organisms, but runs into difficulties when dealing with newly discovered organisms that are significantly different from known ones. For example: it is hard to decide at what level to place a new higher-level grouping, e.g. genus or family or order; this is important since the Linnaean rules for naming groups are tied to their levels, and hence if a group is moved to a different level it must be renamed.|$|E
5|$|She {{was also}} {{scheduled}} to play Fiona Carrick-Smith in the 2013 indie crime drama film Monster Butler.

5|$|The Samba was not {{the only}} Talbot model to see {{customer}} interest waning; as the 1980s progressed, all Talbots began to sell rather poorly and the range was gradually phased out. Peugeot had been working on developing a replacement for the Samba as late as 1984, which would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> on the forthcoming Citroen AX, but this project was abandoned as Peugeot took the decision to phase out the Talbot brand, and the Peugeot 205 was proving so popular that Peugeot felt little need for a third car of this size within the group.|$|E
5|$|The great {{rivalry between}} these two cities may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> on more than {{competition}} for resources. Their dynastic histories reveal different origins and the intense competition between the two powers may have had an ideological grounding. Calakmul's dynasty seems ultimately derived from the great Preclassic city of El Mirador while the dynasty of Tikal was profoundly affected by {{the intervention of the}} distant central Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan. With few exceptions, Tikal's monuments and those of its allies place great emphasis upon single male rulers while the monuments of Calakmul and its allies gave greater prominence to the female line and often the joint rule of king and queen.|$|E
5|$|The {{lives of}} the Strauss dynasty members and their world-renowned craft of {{composing}} Viennese waltzes are also briefly documented in several television adaptations, such as The Strauss Family (1972), The Strauss Dynasty (1991) and Strauss, the King of 3/4 Time (1995). Many other films used his works and melodies, and several films <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>based</b> upon {{the life of the}} musician, the most famous of which is called The Great Waltz (1938), redone in 1972.|$|E
