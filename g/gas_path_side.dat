40|$|Least Square {{approach}} is employed in many branches {{of engineering and}} science. In case of heat transfer problems, least square approach {{can be used to}} estimate heat flux, or can be used to determine important thermal properties such as the thermal conductivity or heat capacity of solids. This, in turn, could be useful for cases where direct measurement of heat flux is not possible due to extremely high temperatures. This type of situation is encountered at surface of a space re-entry vehicle or in a gas turbine engine combustion chamber or high-pressure turbine or furnace. The significance of heat flux and temperature estimation provides vital insight on maximum operating temperature of the solid. The work presented in this paper aims to find out the heat flux and heat transfer coefficient over a flat plate for unsteady phenomenon of heat transfer by analyzing a simple one-dimensional model of a high-pressure gas engine wall, with constant thermal properties and no heat generation within the metal. One side of the wall is exposed to gas path hot air and the other side is exposed to cooling air bled off from the fan in air duct. A sensor at the cool surface of the metal measures temperatures over a range of time. The goal is to use the measured temperatures and the Least Square analysis to estimate the amount of heat flux required on the cool side of the wall to keep the metal on the <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> <b>side</b> below the maximum operating temperature in order to avoid incomplete combustion...|$|E

A {{possible}} {{artifact of}} this process is the formation of small pathways through this filter leading to sensitive sealing materials within the joint.

The FOD-event feature level fusion scheme combines knowledge of shifts in engine <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> performance obtained using a Kalman filter, with bearing accelerometer signal features extracted via wavelet analysis, to positively identify a FOD event. A fuzzy inference system provides basic probability assignments (bpa) based on features extracted from the <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> analysis and bearing accelerometers to a fusion algorithm based on the Dempster-Shafer-Yager Theory of Evidence.

40|$|Aircraft engine {{performance}} trend monitoring and <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> fault diagnostics {{are closely related}} technologies that assist operators in managing the health of their gas turbine engine assets. Trend monitoring {{is the process of}} monitoring the gradual performance change that an aircraft engine will naturally incur over time due to turbomachinery deterioration, while <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> diagnostics is the process of detecting and isolating the occurrence of any faults impacting engine flow-path performance. Today, performance trend monitoring and <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> fault diagnostic functions are performed by a combination of on-board and off-board strategies. On-board engine control computers contain logic that monitors for anomalous engine operation in real-time. Off-board ground stations are used to conduct fleet-wide engine trend monitoring and fault diagnostics based on data collected from each engine each flight. Continuing advances in avionics are enabling the migration of portions of the ground-based functionality on-board, giving rise to more sophisticated on-board engine health management capabilities. This paper reviews the conventional {{engine performance}} trend monitoring and <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> fault diagnostic architecture commonly applied today, and presents a proposed enhanced on-board architecture for future applications. The enhanced architecture gains real-time access to an expanded quantity of engine parameters, and provides advanced on-board model-based estimation capabilities. The benefits of the enhanced architecture include the real-time continuous monitoring of engine health, the early diagnosis of fault conditions, and the estimation of unmeasured engine performance parameters.

40|$|Gas path {{diagnostics}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} effective condition monitoring techniques in supporting condition-based maintenance of gas turbines and improving availability and reducing maintenance costs of the engines. The techniques can be applied to the health monitoring of different <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> components and also <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> measurement sensors. One of the most important measurement sensors is that for the engine control, also called the power setting sensor, which is used by the engine control system to control the operation of gas turbine engines. In most of the published research so far, it is rarely mentioned that faults in such sensors have been tackled in either engine control or condition monitoring. The reality is that if such a sensor degrades and has a noticeable bias, it will result in a shift in engine operating condition and misleading diagnostic results. In this paper, the phenomenon of a power-setting sensor fault has been discussed and a <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> diagnostic method based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been proposed for the detection of power-setting sensor fault with and without the existence of engine component degradation and other <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> sensor faults. The developed method has been applied to the diagnostic analysis of a model aero turbofan engine in several case studies. The results show that the GA-based diagnostic method is able to detect and quantify the power-setting sensor fault effectively with the existence of single engine component degradation and single <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> sensor fault. An exceptional situation is that the power-setting sensor fault may not be distinguished from a component fault if both faults have the same fault signature. In addition, the measurement noise has small impact on prediction accuracy. As the GA-based method is computationally slow, it is only recommended for off-line applications. The introduced GA-based diagnostic method is generic so it can be applied to different gas turbine engines.

40|$|Different {{approaches}} for <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> performance estimation of dynamic systems are commonly used, {{the most common}} being the variants of the Kalman filter. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) method is a popular approach for nonlinear systems which combines the traditional Kalman filtering and linearization techniques to effectively deal with weakly nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems. Its mathematical formulation {{is based on the}} assumption that the probability density function (PDF) of the state vector can be approximated to be Gaussian. Recent investigations have focused on the particle filter (PF) based on Monte Carlo sampling algorithms for tackling strong nonlinear and non-Gaussian models. Considering the aircraft engine is a complicated machine, operating under a harsh environment, and polluted by complex noises, the PF might be an available way to monitor <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> health for aircraft engines. Up to this point in time a number of Kalman filtering approaches have been used for aircraft turbofan engine <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> health estimation, but the particle filters have not been used for this purpose and a systematic comparison has not been published. This paper presents <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> health monitoring based on the PF and the constrained extend Kalman particle filter (cEKPF), and then compares the estimation accuracy and computational effort of these filters to the EKF for aircraft engine performance estimation under rapid faults and general deterioration. Finally, the effects of the constraint mechanism and particle number on the cEKPF are discussed. We show in this paper that the cEKPF outperforms the EKF, PF and EKPF, and conclude that the cEKPF is the best choice for turbofan engine health monitoring...|$|R

Several detection and diagnostic approaches were investigated and a software tool (FODID) was developed to assist researchers detect/diagnose FOD events.

Understanding the effectiveness of cooling flows when making life predictions for rotating components subject to the main <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> temperatures is crucial.

This thesis describes the specific contribution of the author to the research conducted at the test facility. Non-invasive gas seeding and concentration measurement techniques together with hot geometry displacement measurements have been developed to meet three distinct objectives: to determine inter-stage seal flows between rotor disc cavities; to provide data to quantify rim seal exchange flows between rotor stator cavities and the main annulus <b>gas</b> <b>path</b> for both bulk ingestion and egress conditions; and, to provide data to quantify the re-ingestion of cooling air egressed into the main annulus <b>gas</b> <b>path.</b> Detailed knowledge of these flows is vital to understanding the flow structures within rotor stator cavities and to optimise coolant delivery methods.
