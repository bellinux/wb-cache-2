25|$|The {{concept of}} resurrection {{is found in}} the {{writings}} of some ancient non-Abrahamic religions in the Middle East. A few extant Egyptian and Canaanite writings allude to dying and rising gods such as Osiris and Baal. Sir James Frazer in his book The Golden Bough relates to these dying and rising gods, but many of his examples, according to various scholars, distort the sources. Taking a more positive position, Tryggve Mettinger argues <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> book that the category of rise and return to life is significant for the following deities: Ugaritic Baal, Melqart, Adonis, Eshmun, Osiris and Dumuzi.|$|E

How well he had succeeded in Edrich's case! The irony of his pyrrhic victory was that Edrich had not been felled by a bouncer...The English press greeted the incident with headlines such as: 'Licence to Kill!', 'Lillee should be banned' – '007, James Bond cricket'. The atmosphere {{on and off the field}} was emotionally electric. Bodyline was freely discussed. In the background the crowd, lusting for more blood and guts, stirred the embers of controversy chanting for 'Lillee, Lillee'.|$|E
25|$|South Africa named an {{unchanged}} side, {{boosted by}} {{the confidence of}} the draw at Lords and content that their bowlers could deliver as anticipated second time around. Graeme Smith enforced this belief by opting to field, and was rewarded as Morné Morkel and Dale Steyn in particular got stuck into England's batsmen. England were dismissed for 203 on day 1. Kevin Pietersen top scored with 45, and Ian Bell scored 31, but this was the best of a bad bunch. Andrew Flintoff scored 17 and looked to have some confidence with the bat, having had very little success <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> county appearances. But overall, it was a disappointing effort from England, but they did respond with 3 wickets before the close of play to leave South Africa on 101/3.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> PhD thesis and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> {{book the}} Israeli scholar Mordechai Zaken {{discussed}} {{the history of}} the Assyrian Christians of Turkey and Iraq (in the Kurdish vicinity) during the last 180 years, from 1843 onwards. In his studies Zaken outlines three major eruptions that took place between 1843 and 1933 during which the Assyrian Christians lost their land and hegemony in their habitat in the Hakkārī (or Julamerk) region in southeastern Turkey and became refugees in other lands, notably Iran and Iraq, and ultimately established exiled communities in European and western countries (the USA, Canada, Australia, New-Zealand, Sweden, France, to mention some of these countries). Mordechai Zaken wrote this study from an analytical and comparative point of view, comparing the Assyrian Christians' experience with the experience of the Kurdish Jews who had been dwelling in Kurdistan for two thousand years or so, but were forced to emigrate to Israel in the early 1950s. The Jews of Kurdistan were forced to leave {{as a result of the}} Arab-Israeli war, as a result of increasing hostility and acts of violence against Jews in Iraqi and Kurdish towns and villages, and as a result of a new situation that developed during the 1940s in Iraq and Kurdistan in which the ability of Jews to live in relative comfort and tolerance (that was disrupted from time to time prior to that period) with their Arab and Muslim neighbors, as they had done for many years, practically came to an end. In the end, the Jews of Kurdistan had to leave their Kurdish habitat en masse and migrate into Israel. The Assyrian Christians, on the other hand, suffered a similar fate but migrated in stages following each political crisis with the regime in whose boundaries they lived or following each conflict with their Muslim, Turkish, or Arab neighbors, or following the departure or expulsion of their patriarch Mar Shimon in 1933, first to Cyprus and then to the United States. Consequently, although there is still a small and fragile community of Assyrians in Iraq, millions of Assyrian Christians live today in exiled and prosperous communities in the west.|$|E

25|$|Overseas Indians file more patents {{in their}} country of {{residence}} than in India. Thomas Friedman, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> book, The World is Flat, explains this trend in terms of brain drain, whereby {{the best and brightest}} elements in India emigrate to the U.S. in order to seek better financial opportunities. A joint study by Duke University and UC Berkeley revealed that Indian immigrants to the US have founded more engineering and technology companies from 1995 to 2005 than immigrants from the UK, China, Taiwan and Japan combined. A 1999 study by AnnaLee Saxenian reported that a third of Silicon Valley scientists and engineers were immigrants and that Indians are the second largest group of Asian-born engineers (23%) following the Chinese (51%). Her research showed that in 1998, seven percent of high-technology firms in Silicon Valley were led by Indian CEOs. A recent study shows that 23% of Indian business school graduates take a job in United States.|$|E
25|$|Reddy's early {{research}} was conducted at the AI labs at Stanford, first {{as a graduate student}} and later as an Assistant Professor, and at CMU since 1969. His AI research concentrated on perceptual and motor aspect of intelligence such as speech, language, vision and robotics. Over a span of five decades, Reddy and his colleagues created several historic demonstrations of spoken language systems, e.g., voice control of a robot, large vocabulary connected speech recognition, speaker independent speech recognition, and unrestricted vocabulary dictation. Reddy and his colleagues have made seminal contributions to Task Oriented Computer Architectures, Analysis of Natural Scenes, Universal Access to Information, and Autonomous Robotic Systems. Hearsay I {{was one of the first}} systems capable of continuous speech recognition. Subsequent systems like Hearsay II, Dragon, Harpy, and Sphinx I/II developed many of the ideas underlying modern commercial speech recognition technology as summarized <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> historical review of speech recognition with Xuedong Huang and James K. Baker.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{actively}} {{participating in}} the current discussions on evolutionary theory and genetics, Mosterín has also tackled issues like the definition of life itself or the ontology of biological organisms and species. Following in Aristotle’s and Schrödinger’s footsteps, he has been asking the simple question: what is life? He has analyzed the main proposed definitions, based on metabolism, reproduction, thermodynamics, complexity and evolution, and found all of them wanting. It is true that all organisms on Earth share many characteristics, from the encoding of genetic information in DNA to the storage of energy in ATP, but these common features merely reflect the inheritance from a common ancestor that possibly acquired them in a random way. From that point of view, our biology is the parochial science of life on Earth, rather than a universal science of life in general. Such a general biology seems impossible, {{as long as we}} do not detect and come to know other forms of life in the galaxy (if they exist). Concerning the ontological thesis of Michael Ghiselin and David Hull on the individuality of biological species, Mosterín shows that they are neither classes nor individuals in the usual meaning of these words. He tries to extend and make more precise the available conceptual framework of the discussion. Specifically, he shows the formal equivalence of the set-theoretical and the mereological (or part and individual) approach, so that everything that can be said about the classes can be translated into the jargon of individuals, and the other way around. All these concerns converge <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> philosophy of animality, which combines the ontology of animals as paradigmatic individuals with the insights and results of biological research. This general theory of animals provides a solid foundation for the development of anthropology, conceived as the science of human primates.|$|E

500|$|Baseball historians Dewey and Acocella, however, {{described}} a markedly different {{scenario in which}} Johnson secretly sold off McAleer's shares while McAleer was away on a 1913 world tour with Comiskey, New York Giants manager John McGraw, {{and members of the}} Red Sox team. According to this account, McAleer's conflict with Stahl was followed up by his involvement in a feud between two pairs of players – Tris Speaker and Joe [...] "Smoky Joe" [...] Wood, on one side, and Heinie Wagner and Bill Carrigan, on the other. The conflict had a [...] "religious dimension" [...] and was described in the press as [...] "pitting Masons against members of the Knights of Columbus". McAleer evidently supported Wagner and Carrigan, the Catholic players in the dispute. These back-to-back incidents involving individuals associated with the Red Sox team [...] "reinforced Johnson's belief that the club president was the source of all the trouble", Dewey and Acocella wrote. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> book, The Irish in Baseball, David Fleitz observed that McAleer's abrupt dismissal was typical of Johnson, [...] "who had a history of ending relationships when they no longer benefited him personally".|$|E
500|$|While the Doctor alters part of {{the command}} module of Apollo 11, Canton and Amy visit a nearby orphanage, hoping to find where {{the girl in the}} {{spacesuit}} was taken from. Amy discovers a nest of the Silence, and a photograph of her and a baby amongst pictures of the little girl from the space suit. The girl enters with the Silence, and Amy is abducted and taken to their time engine control room. Arriving too late, the Doctor and his allies find Amy's recording device, through which Rory still can hear Amy's voice confessing her love for one of the group. Canton is able to shoot and wound one of the creatures, and from it the Doctor discovers the creatures are the Silence, a group he was warned about by several of his foes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> adventures. Analysing the now-empty space suit, River realises that the girl possesses incredible strength to have forced her way out of it, and that the suit's advanced life-support technology would have called the President as the highest authority figure on Earth when the girl got scared. The Doctor realises why the Silence have been controlling humanity— by guiding their technological advances, they have influenced humanity into the Space Race for purposes of building a spacesuit, which must somehow be crucial to their intentions. Meanwhile, Canton interrogates the captured Silent in the Area 51 prison, who mocks humanity for treating him when [...] "...you should kill us all on sight". Canton records this using Amy's mobile phone.|$|E
