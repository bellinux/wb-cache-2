5|$|Combat {{comes in}} the form of both avoidable random {{encounters}} and scripted fights where the camera is fixed within the fighting area: enemies and bosses are primarily drawn from Japanese folklore and mythology. Battles are triggered only when enemies are near, with the player character otherwise keeping their weapons sheathed. In combat, characters attack and guard using a single-button prompt, while another button accesses <b>items</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> healing potions. Continuously attacking triggers combos. Different moves include sword slashes combined with directional buttons, which have different effects such as throwing an enemy into the air with an upward slash. Additional offensive <b>items</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> smoke bombs are acquired during the course of the game. At the end of each battle, experience points are awarded to the player character depending on how fast the battle was finished: leveling up increases a character's health, stats, and the amount of damage inflicted upon enemies.|$|E

5|$|Only {{fragments}} of artifacts survive from the Brythonic speaking kingdoms of southern Scotland. Pictish {{art can be}} seen in the extensive survival of carved Pictish stones, particularly in the north and east of the country. These display a variety of recurring images and patterns, as at Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno (Angus). There are a few survivals of Pictish silver, notably a number of massive neck-chains including the Whitecleuch Chain, and also the unique silver plaques from the cairn at Norrie's Law. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of Dál Riata is much more difficult to identify, but may include <b>items</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Hunterston brooch, which with other <b>items</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Monymusk Reliquary, suggest that Dál Riata was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed. Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art include metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional <b>items</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the intricately carved whalebone Franks Casket, thought to have been produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs. After the Christian conversion of what is now Scotland in the seventh century, artistic styles in Northumbria interacted with those in Ireland and Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as insular or Hiberno-Saxon.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{permitted}} the POWs to build septic systems and irrigation ditches throughout the prisoner {{side of the}} camp. An onsite commissary was available to sell <b>items</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> bananas, eggs, coffee, notebooks, and cigarettes. Recreational activities allowed for baseball, horseshoes, and ping pong matches. In addition, a 3,000-book library was allowed (much of which {{was provided by the}} Red Cross), and films were shown occasionally. A bulldog was kept by the prisoners, and served as a mascot for the camp. Each year around Christmas, the Japanese guards gave permission for the Red Cross to donate a small box to each of the prisoners, containing <b>items</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> corned beef, instant coffee, and tobacco. Prisoners were also able to send postcards to relatives, although they were censored by the guards.|$|E

5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give bonuses {{to some other}} statistic. There are also usable <b>items</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> potions to restore a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, {{breaking}} containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new SemEval task on Cross-Level Semantic Similarity (CLSS), which measures {{the degree to}} which the meaning of a larger linguistic <b>item,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a paragraph, is captured by a smaller <b>item,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a sentence. High-quality data sets were constructed for four comparison types using multi-stage an-notation procedures with a graded scale of similarity. Nineteen teams submitted 38 systems. Most systems surpassed the baseline performance, with several attain-ing high performance for multiple com-parison types. Further, our results show that comparisons of semantic representa-tion increase performance beyond what is possible with text alone. ...|$|R
