60|$|Thursday morning. After a {{tremendous}} night of crowding, shouting, drinking-house expectoration, Gong-donkey, and correct cards. Symptoms of yesterday's {{gains in the}} way of drink, and of yesterday's losses {{in the way of}} money, abundant. Money-losses very great. As usual, nobody seems to have won; but, large losses and many losers are unquestionable facts. Both Lunatics and Keepers, in general very low. Several of both kinds look in at the chemist's while Mr. Goodchild is making a purchase there, to be 'picked up.' One red-eyed Lunatic, flushed, faded, and disordered, enters hurriedly and cries savagely, 'Hond us a gloss of sal volatile in wather, or soom dommed thing o' thot sart!' Faces at the Betting Rooms very long, and a tendency to bite nails observable. Keepers likewise given this morning to standing about solitary, with their hands in their pockets, looking down at their boots as they fit them into cracks of the pavement, and then looking up whistling and walking away. Grand Alliance Circus out, in procession; buxom lady-member of Grand Alliance, in crimson riding-habit, fresher to look at, even in her paint under the day sky, than the cheeks of Lunatics or Keepers. Spanish Cavalier appears to have lost yesterday, and jingles his bossed bridle with disgust, as if he were paying. Reaction also apparent at the Guildhall opposite, whence certain pickpockets come out handcuffed together, with that peculiar walk which is never seen under any other circumstances--a walk expressive of going to jail, game, but still of jails being in bad taste and arbitrary, and how would YOU like it if it was you instead of me, as it ought to be! Mid-day. Town filled as yesterday, but not so full; and emptied as yesterday, but not so empty. In the evening, Angel ordinary where every Lunatic and Keeper has his modest daily meal of turtle, venison, and wine, not so crowded as yesterday, and not so noisy. At night, the theatre. More abstracted faces in it than one ever sees at public assemblies; such <b>faces</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> which strongly reminds Mr. Goodchild of the boys at school who were 'going up next,' with their arithmetic or mathematics. These boys are, no doubt, going up to-morrow with THEIR sums and figures. Mr. Palmer and Mr. Thurtell in the boxes O. P. Mr. Thurtell and Mr. Palmer in the boxes P. S. The firm of Thurtell, Palmer, and Thurtell, in the boxes Centre. A most odious tendency observable in these distinguished gentlemen to put vile constructions on sufficiently innocent phrases in the play, and then to applaud them in a Satyr-like manner. Behind Mr. Goodchild, with a party of other Lunatics and one Keeper, the express incarnation of the thing called a 'gent.' A gentleman born; a gent manufactured. A something with a scarf round its neck, and a slipshod speech issuing from behind the scarf; more depraved, more foolish, more ignorant, more unable to believe in any noble or good thing of any kind, than the stupidest Bosjesman. The thing is but a boy in years, and is addled with drink. To do its company justice, even its company is ashamed of it, as it drawls its slang criticisms on the representation, and inflames Mr. Goodchild with a burning ardour to fling it into the pit. Its remarks are so horrible, that Mr. Goodchild, for the moment, even doubts whether that IS a wholesome Art, which sets women apart on a high floor before such a thing as this, though as good as its own sisters, or its own mother--whom Heaven forgive for bringing it into the world! But, the consideration that a low nature must make a low world of its own to live in, whatever the real materials, or it could no more exist than any of us could without the sense of touch, brings Mr. Goodchild to reason: the rather, because the thing soon drops its downy chin upon its scarf, and slobbers itself asleep.|$|E
60|$|This painful revery was not prolonged. Shortly {{before noon}} Phil {{came into the}} hiding-place, his <b>face</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of entire satisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|Jack's <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of deep {{compassion}} {{as he said}} in a low voice, [...] "No fear, Ralph; {{the sufferings}} of these poor fellows are over long ago." ...|$|R
60|$|Jacques {{observed}} his consternation, {{and was not}} {{a little}} entertained by it, although his <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of profound gravity while he proceeded to attack his own dish, which was {{equal to that of}} his friend.|$|R
60|$|When {{she looked}} up, her <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> {{which no one}} had ever seen on it before; a look of mingled pain and patience, as if some loss had come to her, and left the {{bitterness}} of regret behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel merry--indeed, Your Majesty, I do!" [...] protested Rinkitink, {{anxious to}} escape the tickling. But even as he professed to [...] "feel merry" [...] his round, red <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of horror and anxiety that was realty comical.|$|R
60|$|Lady Valleys {{opened it}} with a slight grimace, which deepened as she read. Her handsome, florid <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of sadness seldom seen there. There was, in fact, more than a touch of dignity in her {{reception}} of the unpalatable news.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, my dear chap, you mustn't.' The Babe's <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of horror. The {{success of}} the House-team in the final was very near to his heart. He could not {{understand}} anyone jesting on the subject. Charteris respected his anguish, and relieved it speedily.|$|R
6000|$|... "The servant {{struck a}} match, {{and we had}} a look at my passenger. He was a young, good-looking fellow, but his <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of pain, and his jaw hung down. He was evidently not only dead, but had been dead some time.|$|R
60|$|What {{would he}} say? Should she tell him? She was {{surprised}} to find that the idea of doing so was painful to her. But she was aroused from these reflections by a step on the path, and raised her head to perceive the Vicomte. His <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of triumph.|$|R
60|$|Once at night, when Gertrude withdrew to her {{chamber and}} before seeking her pillow, {{prepared}} to retire as a preliminary to disrobing--in other words, {{before going to}} bed, she flung wide the casement (opened the window) and perceived (saw) the face of Lord Ronald. He {{was sitting on a}} thorn bush beneath her, and his upturned <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of agonised pallor.|$|R
60|$|Then Uncle John, {{who ought}} to have been in bed and sound asleep at this uncanny hour of night, came {{bouncing}} in, accompanied by Arthur Weldon. Each made a dive for a paper and each <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of genuine delight. The roar of the press made conversation difficult, but Mr. Merrick caught his nieces in his arms, by turn, and gave each one an ecstatic hug and kiss.|$|R
60|$|At last {{we heard}} the front door shut behind them, and my father came upstairs, his usually serene <b>face</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> {{disturbed}} <b>expression.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Uncle Isham {{stood on}} the ground, his feet close to the bottom step; his hat was in his hand, and his upturned <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of earnestness which seemed to set uncomfortably upon it. [...] "Mahs' Junius," [...] said he, [...] "dar ain't no acciden' come to ole miss; she's done gone cos she wanted to, an' she ain't come back cos she didn't want to. Dat's ole miss, right fru." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Vladimir, First Secretary, had a drawing-room {{reputation}} as an agreeable and entertaining man. He {{was something of a}} favourite in society. His wit consisted in discovering droll connections between incongruous ideas; and when talking in that strain he sat well forward of his seat, with his left hand raised, as if exhibiting his funny demonstrations between the thumb and forefinger, while his round and clean-shaven <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of merry perplexity.|$|R
60|$|The girl's <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> troubled <b>expression.</b> Jeanne {{began to}} suspect {{that she had not}} as yet come to the real object of this interview.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Jackson {{was reading}} the Church Times. Her thin, sharp <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of strong disapproval; her tightly-closed mouth, her sharp nose, even the angular lines of her body, {{signified}} clearly that her moral sense was outraged. She put her hand quickly to her massive fringe {{to see that it}} was straight, and rose to shake hands with Mr. Dryland. His heavy red face assumed at once a grave look; his moral sense was outraged, too.|$|R
60|$|His manner was {{far from}} {{encouraging}} and his <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> severe <b>expression.</b> Altogether I felt a little nervous. But {{it had to be}} done, so I began.|$|R
60|$|Jeeves was happy, {{partly because}} he loves to {{exercise}} his giant brain, and {{partly because he}} was having a corking time among the bright lights. I saw him one night at the Midnight Revels. He was sitting at a table {{on the edge of the}} dancing floor, doing himself remarkably well with a fat cigar and a bottle of the best. I'd never imagined he could look so nearly human. His <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of austere benevolence, and he was making notes in a small book.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] she said, {{although}} her <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> troubled <b>expression.</b> [...] "I must {{have left it}} somewhere. Here; I'll put a pillow in its place until I find it." ...|$|R
60|$|Benson's <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> curious, {{strained}} <b>expression,</b> {{but he did}} not speak.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is the Commander-in-Chief!" [...] the Governor hurriedly {{whispered to}} his companions, who at once {{followed}} his example in prostrating themselves {{before the great}} man. The Commander gravely bowed in return. He was covered with gold lace from head to foot: his <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of deep misery: {{and he had a}} little black pig under each arm. Still the gallant fellow did his best, {{in the midst of the}} orders he was every moment issuing to his men, to bid a courteous farewell to the departing guests.|$|R
6000|$|And {{now there}} arrived a {{plentiful}} supper, {{and a bottle}} of good wine, of which the giver was not sorry to partake after the meagre dinner at three o'clock, to which I had been invited by the Campaigner; and it was midnight when I walked back with my friend to his house in the upper town; and all the stars of heaven were shining cheerily; and my dear Clive's <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of happiness, such as I remembered in old days, as we shook hands and parted with a [...] "God bless you." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this instant}} the {{youngest}} burglar spoke. His <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> very anxious <b>expression.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{eyes of the}} Sergeant brightened, and his <b>face</b> even <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of {{military}} triumph, though it was of a degree that suited the humble sphere {{in which he had}} been an actor.|$|R
60|$|Just {{then the}} door opened, and Mr Mason entered. His <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> dreadfully anxious <b>expression.</b>|$|R
60|$|Juliette, awed, terrified, {{was gazing}} {{at her father}} with great, {{wondering}} eyes. He seemed unlike himself. His <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> curious <b>expression</b> of ecstasy and of hatred, also of hope and exultation, whenever he looked steadily at her.|$|R
60|$|IT WAS {{nearly ten}} o'clock the {{following}} morning when Barbara, sitting upon the veranda of the ranchhouse, saw her father approaching {{from the direction of}} the office. His <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> troubled <b>expression</b> which the girl could not but note.|$|R
60|$|Smoke and Shorty {{encountered}} each other, {{going in}} opposite directions, {{at the corner}} where stood the Elkhorn saloon. The former's <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> pleased <b>expression,</b> and he was walking briskly. Shorty, on the other hand, was slouching along in a depressed and indeterminate fashion.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] Harding {{answered}} and added nothing further, while Benson, whose <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> curious strained <b>expression,</b> did not speak.|$|R
60|$|Repairing to a noted coffee-house in Covent Garden when he {{left the}} locksmith's, Mr Chester sat long over a late dinner, {{entertaining}} himself exceedingly with the whimsical recollection of his recent proceedings, and congratulating himself very much on his great cleverness. Influenced by these thoughts, his <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> so benign and tranquil, that the waiter in immediate attendance upon him felt he could almost have died in his defence, and settled in his own mind (until the receipt of the bill, and a very small fee for very great trouble disabused it of the idea) that such an apostolic customer was worth half-a-dozen of the ordinary run of visitors, at least.|$|R
60|$|Rodney {{took the}} book, {{held it in}} front of him, {{inserted}} one finger between the pages, but said nothing. His <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> queer <b>expression</b> of deliberation, as if he were weighing one thing with another, and would not say anything until his mind were made up.|$|R
60|$|A {{moment later}} the two entered the {{audience}} chamber. Barney found that Leopold the king, surrounded by comforts and safety, {{was a very different}} person from Leopold the fugitive. The weak <b>face</b> now <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of arrogance, though the king spoke most graciously to the American.|$|R
60|$|There were many, too, who {{remarked that}} a {{touching}} friendship {{in the front}} seats (formerly plainly {{visible to the naked}} eye from the back) had been strained--at least. Mr. Crewe still sat with Mr. Botcher and Mr. Bascom, but he was not a man to pretend after the fires had cooled. The Honourable Jacob Botcher, with his eyes shut so tight, that his honest <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of agony, seemed to pray every morning for the renewal of that friendship when the chaplain begged the Lord to guide the Legislature into the paths of truth; and the Honourable Brush Bascom <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> air of resignation which was painful to see. Conversation languished, and the cosey and familiar haunts of the Pelican knew Mr. Crewe no more.|$|R
60|$|The {{poor woman}} was in despair at {{witnessing}} her husband's undignified actions {{and wondered what}} she might do to control him. The professor seemed more grave than usual; the senator's <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> offended <b>expression,</b> and Bessie kept moving her fingers as if she still wanted to play the piano.|$|R
60|$|Cor {{was a big}} woman, {{almost as}} tall as King Gos. She had {{flashing}} black eyes and the dark complexion you see on gypsies. Her temper, when irritated, was something dreadful, and her <b>face</b> <b>wore</b> <b>an</b> evil <b>expression</b> which she tried to cover by smiling sweetly--often when she meant the most mischief.|$|R
