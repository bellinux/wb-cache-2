As waste sits in municipal landfills, <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> are emitted into the atmosphere. However, when waste is recycled, these <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions are reduced. The total reductions in emissions that are identified with the schools waste reduction accomplishments are calculated using the EPA’s WARM factors that are programmed in the WasteWise Re-TRAC system. The <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> reductions are divided by the total game attendance, {{in order to get}} a number for the <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emission reductions per person.

40|$|The {{consumption}} of food products involves emissions of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases.</b> Emissions {{occur in the}} various stages {{of the life cycle}} of food products. In this paper we discuss the <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions, CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O, related to Dutch household food consumption. Combinations of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> intensities (per DB) with annual household expenditures results in the <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions from annual food consumption. An energy analysis methodology is elaborated with <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions to calculate <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> intensities. The CO 2 emission pattern resembles closely the household expenditure pattern. Emission patterns of CH 4 and N 2 O differ strongly from the expenditure pattern. Food products from cattle farming determine the CH 4 emissions, while food products from agriculture determine the N 2 O emissions. The non-CO 2 <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> contribute 25 % to the total emissions of CO 2 equivalents from Dutch household food consumption, significantly above their share in the total Dutch emission of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases.</b> For food product life cycles {{it is very important to}} include the non-CO 2 <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases.</b> The analyses show differences in <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> intensities within food product categories and between food product categories. These differences offer possibilities for reduction options. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change is}} one of the largest {{problems}} facing this generation. Anthropogenically caused increases of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions is a significant culprit to this problem. Although the obvious problems such as cars, industry, and urbanism garnish a significant amount of the criticism, natural sources such as wetlands are also beginning to contribute to this issue. This is becoming increasingly significant as wetlands shift from being sinks of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> to becoming sources as various anthropogenic impacts, including global warming itself, begin to affect the health of the wetlands. The aim of this project is to look at four common types of wetlands, being tropical mangroves, temperate coastal marshes, inland meadows, and subarctic peatlands, all located in different climactic areas of the world, and by doing a meta-analysis of available data of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> production for each wetland type, observe how differences in their <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> production may contribute or be affected by climate change and global warming. Results of the meta-analysis revealed that the most significant production of the potent <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> nitrous oxide occurs in coastal wetlands such as tropical mangroves and coastal marshes, while the <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> methane is seen to be produced most in subarctic peatlands. These contributions of wetlands to global <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> production are not as significant as other anthropogenic contributions. However, subarctic wetlands contribute to more than half of the global methane emissions, and the most important aspect of wetland <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> production is that they are producing more <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> than they would normally be sequestering, contributing more than the basic <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> production data can display. Global climate changes such as temperature increase and sea level rise could also make these levels of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> production become worse, although measures to decrease the effects of this such as regulations on anthropogenic nitrogen input, macrophyte presence, and prevention of peat burning...|$|R
