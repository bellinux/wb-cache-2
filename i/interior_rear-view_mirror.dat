50|$|Depending on {{the type}} of {{motorcycle}}, the motorcycle {{may or may not have}} <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Street-legal motorcycles are generally required to have <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Motorcycles for off-road use only normally do not have <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors.</b> <b>Rear-view</b> <b>mirrors</b> come in various shapes and designs, and have various methods of mounting the mirrors to the motorcycle, most commonly to the handlebars. <b>Rear-view</b> <b>mirrors</b> can also be attached to the rider's motorcycle helmet.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve {{the safety of the}} moving car,we have to make {{simulation}} and analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror.</b> We should consider, in addition to the geometric dimensions, standards and demands, a reasonable choice of the mirror size and installing position, the dynamic characteristics of the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> {{in the design of the}} car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror.</b> In this paper, we use the finite element software ANSYS to simulate the vibration frequency and vibration modals of the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> under the condition of excitation sources. Based on this and the strength analysis results of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> we make a optimal design of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> structure. We get five-order vibration modals in working condition and analysis the size of displacement and deformation, and dynamic characteristics. The results show that because of the low modal frequency, the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> is easily inspired by the engine, powertrain system and road to vibrate. Besides, the deformation and the strain distribution of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> are not uniform. So we should control the low rank flexibility modal frequency within a certain threshold frequency when designing its structure. On the condition of little changes of its overall volume, the maximum equivalent stress of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> decreased by 30. 5 % through optimizing design...|$|R

5000|$|On {{the first}} anniversary of the {{introduction}} of the fourth generation, [...] "EyeSight" [...] was once again offered on the Japanese-spec Outback. EyeSight consists of 2 cameras with one on each side of the <b>interior</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> that use human-like stereoscopic vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system can help maintain a safe distance on the highway, a lane departure warning system, a wake up call when traffic lights change, and even keeps an eye out for pedestrians. SI-Cruise has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid.|$|E

On the electrically adjustable {{steering wheel}} column are also mounted the gearbox control lever, the stalk for controlling the speedtronic and cruise control functions, the main combination lever that operates the indicators, high beam and windscreen wipers and a stalk to adjust {{the steering wheel and}} control the optional heated steering wheel. Controls for the interior lighting and the sun roof or panoramic sun roof are mounted on the roof, near the <b>interior</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror.</b> This section also includes a compartment for sun glasses.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Gentex Corporation is {{developing}} a new style of <b>interior</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> where the substrate sits proud of the mirror housing. Federal regulations require at least a 2. 5 mm radius of curvature {{around the perimeter of}} the substrate, and a grinding operation has been determined to form the radius in the substrate. During the process development, scratches have been observed along the surface of the ground edge. The purpose of this study was to utilize design of experiment (DOE) techniques to determine the process parameters that most significantly affected the presence of the scratches. METHODS: Feed rate, tool speed, and tool rotational direction were tested using a 23 full factorial design with two replicates. A vertical CNC and a diamond abrasive tool were used to form the ground edge into the substrate. Surface scratches on the ground surface were measured using an optical microscope. ANALYSES: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the data from the study. The response variable was the number of scratches present on a ground substrate. RESULTS: Using a significance level of α = 0. 05, the only significant factor that affected the presence of the surface scratches was the tool rotational direction with a p-value of 0. 013. It was determined that up-grinding produced less surface scratches than down-grinding. There were no significant interactions between factors. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that tool rotational direction significantly affected the number of surface scratches on a substrate, and the feed rate and tool speed were insignificant. To reduce the occurrence of the surface scratches, up-grinding should be employed...|$|E

40|$|Automotive safety {{has gained}} an {{increasing}} amount of interest {{from the general}} public, governments, and the car industry. This is more than justified by traffic accident statistics, as each year around 1. 2 million people die due to road traffic accidents. For these reasons safety remains a core value of Volvo Cars. This paper presents {{some of the latest}} active safety developments within Volvo Cars. Rear-end collisions are common accident scenarios and a common cause of these accidents is driver distraction and thus not reacting in time. No vehicle system is a substitute for the most important safety feature in any vehicle: the driver. However, Volvo is harnessing innovative technologies to help alert drivers to avoid potential collisions and reduce the potential impact speed when a collision cannot be avoided. One of those systems is Collision Warning with Auto Brake where the area in front of the vehicle is continuously monitored {{with the help of a}} long-range radar and a forward-sensing wide-angle camera fitted in front of the <b>interior</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror.</b> A warning and brake support will be provided for collisions with other vehicles, both moving and stationary. Additionally, if the driver does not intervene in spite of the warning and the possible collision is judged to be unavoidable; intervention braking is automatically applied to slow down the car. This aims at reducing impact speeds and thus the risk for consequences. This system has been verified using innovative CAE methods and practical tests. Finally, it is discussed how the benefit of such systems can be judged from real-life safety perspective using traffic accident statistics...|$|E

40|$|The <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> is a metaphoric {{favourite}} {{in popular}} culture. This exploratory essay positions the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> as, predominantly, a quintessentially modern device for reimagining {{the past and}} its relationship to the present and future. Combined with that icon of modern economies, the motorcar, it gives a sense of a paved journey towards the future while from the driver’s seat allowing a framed, receding view of the past. With distance that past can be critically held: ‘it now makes sense’. This sensemaking relies upon a spatial rendering of time that makes past, present and future concrete. However, this dominant metaphor of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> in popular culture is supplemented by less certain uses: it can also evoke the uncanny; bring spectres from the past into the present; or heighten our enmeshment with structural power. This essay explores this terrain of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> in examples from radio, song, music video and film, and then questions the efficacy of the metaphor in the anthropocene. The <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> then, is an entry point for considering our engagement with the past, present and future, and how and where is our gaze directed and for whom...|$|R
