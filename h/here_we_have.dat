25|$|A simple {{example is}} the set of non-zero {{rational}} numbers. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> identity 1, as opposed to groups under addition where the identity is typically 0. Note that with the rationals, we must exclude zero because, under multiplication, {{it does not have}} an inverse: there is no rational number that can be multiplied by zero to result in 1. In this example we have an abelian group, but that is not always the case.|$|E
25|$|We {{have been}} looking one by one at the {{possible}} solutions {{to each of the}} situations, which are also complicated to put into practice, thus <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a general solution that could be apply to all the possible rating errors. It is difficult to minimized rater errors, since we are humans and we are not objective. Moreover, sometimes, we are not aware of our behavior of having preferences towards people but there are some tools {{in order to have a}} more objective information as using available technology to track performances and record it which enables manager to have some objective information about the process.|$|E
25|$|Around 1917-1920 social outsiders, the nostalgic loners {{who spend}} their lives in saloons or {{interiors}} with scanty furniture, replaced the earlier fishermen and their families, sailors, and merchants. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a clear connection with the “miserable” trend of the young Picasso, such as his Saltimbanques of the blue period. At the same time, these sad themes are counterbalanced by representations of happy families in various configurations: a mother playing with a smiling child, a family playing with a puppet-theatre, etc. The paintings from his last period gain more light and life, while the artist does not eschew dissonances. Contours dissolve {{on the edges of}} bordering color areas and spot-lighting melts the surfaces of stylized forms.|$|E

500|$|The book's fiftieth {{anniversary in}} 2007 {{prompted}} a reevaluation {{of the book}} from some critics. Yvonne Coppard, reviewing the fiftieth anniversary edition in Carousel magazine, wondered if {{the popularity of the}} Cat and his [...] "delicious naughty behavior" [...] will endure another fifty years. Coppard wrote, [...] "The innocent ignorance of bygone days has given way to an all-embracing, almost paranoid awareness of child protection issues. And <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the mysterious stranger who comes in, uninvited, while your mother is out." ...|$|E
500|$|Tony's doomed quest in the Brazilian jungle {{is framed}} in biblical terms; the {{relevant}} chapter title, [...] "In Search of a City" [...] alludes to Hebrews 13:14: [...] "For <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no continuing city, but we seek one to come". However, Waugh remarked {{of the novel}} that it was [...] "humanist, and said all I wanted to say about humanism". He believed that the essential 20th century conflict was between Christianity and Chaos, and chose to present a chaotic world to demonstrate that civilisation did not have in itself the power to survive. Thus, in the Brazilian jungle, Tony encounters what Davis terms [...] "power without grace... secular feudalism unredeemed by the saving grace of Christianity". Todd is the symbol of humanist, irreligious power.|$|E
500|$|Dein {{described}} Wenger as {{the most}} important manager in the club's history: [...] "Arsène's a miracle worker. He's revolutionised the club. He's turned players into world-class players. Since he has been <b>here,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen football from another planet". Former Watford manager Graham Taylor said of Wenger in 2002: [...] "I believe his biggest contribution to football is getting across the idea that players have to prepare right and look after themselves". Wenger's loyalty towards financial fair play and handling of Arsenal's debt since their stadium move has earnt him praise, not least from American baseball general manager Billy Beane, who in particular lauded his transfer strategy. A survey in 2007 found Wenger was the only Premier League manager to have made a profit on transfers, and between 2004 and 2009, he made an average profit of £4.4million per season on transfers, far more than any other club.|$|E
