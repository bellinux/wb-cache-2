5|$|The <b>euphotic</b> zone is {{somewhat}} arbitrarily defined as {{extending from the}} surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight irradiance, depending on season, latitude and degree of water turbidity. In the clearest ocean water, the <b>euphotic</b> zone may extend {{to a depth of}} about 150metres, or rarely, up to 200metres. Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the <b>euphotic</b> zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less. The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends {{from the base of the}} <b>euphotic</b> zone to about 1000metres. Extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the seabed is the aphotic zone, a region of perpetual darkness.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor communities {{are considered to be}} food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the <b>euphotic</b> zone, thousands of meters above. Most of the organic flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the <b>euphotic</b> zone), which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental margins.|$|E
5|$|Owing in part {{to their}} vast size, abyssal plains are {{believed}} to be major reservoirs of biodiversity. They also exert significant influence upon ocean carbon cycling, dissolution of calcium carbonate, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations over time scales of a hundred to a thousand years. The structure of abyssal ecosystems are strongly influenced by the rate of flux of food to the seafloor and the composition of the material that settles. Factors such as climate change, fishing practices, and ocean fertilization have a substantial effect on patterns of primary production in the <b>euphotic</b> zone.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. This is probably because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the <b>euphotic</b> and aphotic zones by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to land mammals which have a flattened lens, whales have a spherical lens. The retina is surrounded by a reflective layer of cells (tapetum lucidum), which bounces light back at the retina, enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer layer to prevent abrasions, and an oily fluid (instead of tears) on the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones.|$|E
25|$|The <b>euphotic</b> depth is {{the depth}} at which light {{intensity}} falls to 1% {{of the value}} at the surface. This depth is dependent upon water clarity, being only a few metres underwater in a turbid estuary, but may reach up to 200 metres in the open ocean. At the <b>euphotic</b> depth, plants (such as phytoplankton) have no net energy gain from photosynthesis and thus cannot grow.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen {{entering}} the <b>euphotic</b> zone {{is referred to}} as new nitrogen because it is newly arrived from outside the productive layer.|$|E
25|$|The {{nutrients}} {{in the ocean}} are not uniformly distributed. Areas of upwelling provide supplies of nitrogen from below the <b>euphotic</b> zone. Coastal zones provide nitrogen from runoff and upwelling occurs readily along the coast. However, {{the rate at which}} nitrogen can be taken up by phytoplankton is decreased in oligotrophic waters year-round and temperate water in the summer resulting in lower primary production. The distribution of the different forms of nitrogen varies throughout the oceans as well.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{in ocean}} environments, the first bottom trophic level is {{occupied}} principally by phytoplankton, microscopic drifting organisms, mostly one-celled algae, that {{float in the}} sea. Most phytoplankton {{are too small to}} be seen individually with the unaided eye. They can appear as a green discoloration of the water when they are present in high enough numbers. Since they increase their biomass mostly through photosynthesis they live in the sun-lit surface layer (<b>euphotic</b> zone) of the sea.|$|E
25|$|The first {{comprehensive}} phytoplankton {{survey was}} released in 2006. With an annual average chlorophyll a in the mixed layer of 2.2mg m−3 and low nutrient levels in the <b>euphotic</b> zone, the lake is clearly oligotrophic. Diatoms are the dominant group in the lake, particularly {{during the dry season}} episodes of deep mixing. During the rainy season, the stratified water column, with high light and lower nutrient availability, favour dominance of cyanobacteria with high numbers of phototrophic picoplankton. The actual primary production is 0.71g C m−2 d−1 (≈ 260g C m−2 a−1).|$|E
25|$|Ammonium and nitrite show {{a maximum}} {{concentration}} at 50–80 m (lower {{end of the}} <b>euphotic</b> zone) with decreasing concentration below that depth. This distribution can {{be accounted for by}} the fact that nitrite and ammonium are intermediate species. They are both rapidly produced and consumed through the water column. The amount of ammonium in the ocean is about 3 orders of magnitude less than nitrate. Between ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate, nitrite has the fastest turnover rate. It can be produced during nitrate assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification; however, it is immediately consumed again.|$|E
500|$|The stratum of {{the water}} column nearest {{the surface of the}} ocean (sea level) is {{referred}} to as the photic zone. The photic zone can be subdivided into two different vertical regions. The uppermost portion of the photic zone, where there is adequate light to support photosynthesis by phytoplankton and plants, {{is referred to as the}} <b>euphotic</b> zone (also referred to as the epipelagic zone, or surface zone). The lower portion of the photic zone, where the light intensity is insufficient for photosynthesis, is called the dysphotic zone (dysphotic means [...] "poorly lit" [...] in Greek). The dysphotic zone is also referred to as the mesopelagic zone, or the twilight zone. Its lowermost boundary is at a thermocline of , which, in the tropics generally lies between 200 and 1000metres.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle {{is an important}} process in the ocean as well. While the overall cycle is similar, there are different players and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through the precipitation, runoff, or as N2 from the atmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by phytoplankton as N2 so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by cyanobacteria. Without supplies of fixed nitrogen entering the marine cycle, the fixed nitrogen would be used up in about 2000 years. Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter. [...] Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the <b>euphotic</b> zone by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, vertical mixing, or sinking of waste of vertical migrators. The sinking results in ammonia being introduced at lower depths below the <b>euphotic</b> zone. Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the <b>euphotic</b> zone. Ammonification or Mineralization is performed by bacteria to convert organic nitrogen to ammonia. Nitrification can then occur to convert the ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. Nitrate can {{be returned to the}} <b>euphotic</b> zone by vertical mixing and upwelling where it can be taken up by phytoplankton to continue the cycle. N2 can be returned to the atmosphere through denitrification.|$|E
2500|$|... |issue=6}} [...] The {{former is}} {{primarily}} a function of differential CO2 solubility in seawater and the thermohaline circulation, while the latter {{is the sum of}} a series of biological processes that transport carbon (in organic and inorganic forms) from the surface <b>euphotic</b> zone to the ocean's interior. [...] A small fraction of the organic carbon transported by the biological pump to the seafloor is buried in anoxic conditions under sediments and ultimately forms fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas.|$|E
2500|$|The sunlit zone of {{the ocean}} is called the photic zone (or <b>euphotic</b> zone). [...] This is a {{relatively}} thin layer (10–100 m) near the ocean's surface where there is sufficient light for photosynthesis to occur. [...] For practical purposes, {{the thickness of the}} photic zone is typically defined by the depth at which light reaches 1% of its surface value. [...] Light is attenuated down the water column by its absorption or scattering by the water itself, and by dissolved or particulate material within it (including phytoplankton).|$|E
2500|$|Aquatic {{plants are}} more buoyant than their {{terrestrial}} counterparts because freshwater {{has a higher}} density than air. [...] This makes structural rigidity unimportant in lakes and ponds [...] (except in the aerial stems and leaves). [...] Thus, the leaves and stems of most aquatic plants use less energy to construct and maintain woody tissue, investing that energy into fast growth instead. In order to contend with stresses induced by wind and waves, plants must be both flexible and tough. [...] Light, water depth and substrate types {{are the most important}} factors controlling the distribution of submerged aquatic plants. [...] Macrophytes are sources of food, oxygen, and habitat structure in the benthic zone, but cannot penetrate the depths of the <b>euphotic</b> zone and hence are not found there.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{nitrogen}} {{can come}} from below the <b>euphotic</b> zone or from outside sources. Outside sources are upwelling from deep water and nitrogen fixation. If the organic matter is eaten, respired, delivered to the water as ammonia, and re-incorporated into organic matter by phytoplankton it is considered recycled/regenerated production.New production {{is an important component}} of the marine environment. One reason is that only continual input of new nitrogen can determine the total capacity of the ocean to produce a sustainable fish harvest. Harvesting fish from regenerated nitrogen areas will lead to a decrease in nitrogen and therefore a decrease in primary production. This will have a negative effect on the system. However, if fish are harvested from areas of new nitrogen the nitrogen will be replenished.|$|E
2500|$|One way to {{increase}} the carbon sequestration efficiency of the oceans is to add micrometre-sized iron particles {{in the form of}} either hematite (iron oxide) or melanterite (iron sulfate) to certain regions of the ocean. This has the effect of stimulating growth of plankton. [...] Iron is an important nutrient for phytoplankton, usually made available via upwelling along the continental shelves, inflows from rivers and streams, as well as deposition of dust suspended in the atmosphere. Natural sources of ocean iron have been declining in recent decades, contributing to an overall decline in ocean productivity (NASA, 2003). [...] Yet in the presence of iron nutrients plankton populations quickly grow, or 'bloom', expanding the base of biomass productivity throughout the region and removing significant quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere via photosynthesis. [...] A test in 2002 in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica suggests that between 10,000 and 100,000 carbon atoms are sunk for each iron atom added to the water. [...] More recent work in Germany (2005) suggests that any biomass carbon in the oceans, whether exported to depth or recycled in the <b>euphotic</b> zone, represents long-term storage of carbon. [...] This means that application of iron nutrients in select parts of the oceans, at appropriate scales, could have the combined effect of restoring ocean productivity {{while at the same time}} mitigating the effects of human caused emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.|$|E
5000|$|The zone {{which extends}} {{from the base of}} the <b>euphotic</b> zone to about 200 metres is {{sometimes}} called the disphotic zone. [...] While there is some light, it is insufficient for photosynthesis, or at least insufficient for photosynthesis at a rate greater than respiration. The <b>euphotic</b> zone together with the disphotic zone coincides with the epipelagic zone. The bottommost zone, below the <b>euphotic</b> zone, is called the aphotic zone. Most deep ocean waters belong to this zone.|$|E
50|$|In {{biological}} oceanography, {{new production}} {{is supported by}} nutrient inputs from outside the <b>euphotic</b> zone, especially upwelling of nutrients from deep water, but also from terrestrial and atmosphere sources (as opposite to regenerated production, which is supported by recycling of nutrients in the <b>euphotic</b> zone). New production depends on mixing and vertical advective processes associated with the circulation.|$|E

50|$|It {{extends from}} the surface down to a depth where light {{intensity}} falls to one percent of that at the surface, called the <b>euphotic</b> depth. Accordingly, its thickness depends {{on the extent of}} light attenuation in the water column. Typical <b>euphotic</b> depths vary from only a few centimetres in highly turbid eutrophic lakes, to around 200 meters in the open ocean. It also varies with seasonal changes in turbidity.|$|E
5000|$|In several studies, the DCM layer {{was found}} to be located in the thermocline, {{adjacent}} to the nutracline, {{at the bottom of the}} <b>euphotic</b> layer, where light attenuation ranges from ~1-2% [...] up to ~10% of that at the surface. A DCM can also exist below the <b>euphotic</b> zone, where less than 1% of the surface light remains and little photosynthetic growth is possible; these layers are formed by subduction of surface waters, or sinking of cells.|$|E
50|$|The epipelagic (<b>euphotic)</b> zone, {{also called}} the sunlit zone, {{receives}} enough sunlight to support photosynthesis. The temperatures in this zone range anywhere from 40 to -3 C(NHPTV).|$|E
50|$|Local wave power could {{be used to}} pump nutrient-rich {{water from}} hundred- metre-plus depths to the <b>euphotic</b> zone. However, deep water {{concentrations}} of dissolved CO2 could {{be returned to the}} atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, {{the natural}} marine ecosystems, a major {{supplier}} {{of food to}} human societies, are less vulnerable to sudden temperature fall. However, they are highly sensitive to reduced incident sunlight and increased level of UV-B radiation. In {{the event of a}} large-scale nuclear war, a mere 25% reduction in ozone is predicted to cause an enhanced UV-B radiation that reduce net photosynthesis in the surface <b>euphotic</b> zone by 35%, and in the whole <b>euphotic</b> zone by 10% (<b>euphotic</b> zone refers to depths in the ocean with light levels sufficient for active photosynthesis). With a corresponding reduction in light available for photosynthesis, phytoplankton populations are expected to plummet, and scientists have even speculated that most of the phytoplankton and herbivorous zooplanktons (that feed on phytoplanktons) in {{more than half of the}} Northern Hemisphere oceans would die. According to The World Bank, the ocean supplies the world's population with 16% of their animal protein intake; given that the marine food chains are built upon the photosynthesis of phytoplanktons, large-scale nuclear wars will inadvertently devastate fisheries and affect millions, if not billions of people who rely on the ocean for food.|$|E
50|$|Data {{collected}} in the Sargasso Sea region {{in the western part}} of the North Atlantic Gyre has led to analytical evidence that the variability of this gyre is linked to wintertime convective mixing. According to Bates (2001), a seasonal variation of 8-10 °C in surface temperature occurs alongside a fluctuation in the mixed layer depth between the Northern Hemisphere winter and summer seasons. The depth rises from 200 meters in winter to about 10 meters in summer. Nutrients remain below the <b>euphotic</b> zone for most of the year, resulting in low primary production. Yet during winter convective mixing, nutrients penetrate the <b>euphotic</b> zone, causing a short-lived phytoplankton bloom in the spring. This then lifts the mixed-layer depth to 10 meters.|$|E
50|$|According to Takahashi (1983) radiolarians {{stay for}} 2 to 6 {{weeks in the}} <b>euphotic</b> zone (productive surface layer to 200 meters water depth) before they start sinking. Their descent through 5000 meters of ocean water can take from two weeks to as long as 14 months.|$|E
50|$|Mode waters have a {{big impact}} on {{nutrients}} distribution as they prevent deep-ocean nutrients from upwelling to the <b>euphotic</b> zone.

5000|$|Plankton {{drive the}} [...] "biological pump", a {{process by which}} the ocean {{ecosystem}} transports carbon from the surface <b>euphotic</b> zone to the ocean's depths. Such processes are vital to carbon dioxide sinks, one of several possibilities for countering global warming. Modern planktology includes behavioral aspects of drifting organisms, engaging modern in situ imaging devices.|$|E
50|$|In the spring, {{more light}} becomes {{available}} and stratification {{of the water}} column occurs as increasing temperatures warm the surface waters (referred to as thermal stratification). As a result, vertical mixing is inhibited and phytoplankton and nutrients are entrained in the <b>euphotic</b> zone. This creates a comparitvely high nutrient and high light environment that allows rapid phytoplankton growth.|$|E
50|$|Sediment traps are {{instruments}} used in oceanography {{to measure}} the quantity of sinking particulate organic (and inorganic) material in aquatic systems, usually oceans.
