Below this dam is Merced Falls Dam, an irrigation <b>diversion</b> dam. The lowermost, the Crocker-Huffman <b>Diversion</b> Dam, was built in 1906 and completely blocks the passage of anadromous fish up the Merced River.|$|E

40|$|Unscreened <b>diversions</b> on the Upper Sacramento River in California {{have been}} {{identified}} as a source of juvenile salmonid losses. Legislative mandates, improvements in large screened <b>diversions</b> and especially listing of the winter-run chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) accelerated interest in screening these <b>diversions.</b> Recent actions include inventorying and prioritizing <b>diversions</b> to be screened, outreach programs (such as demonstration projects and a workshop for water diverters) and enforcement. The author discusses these actions and cites examples of <b>diversions</b> recently screened. The interactions of attitudes, conflicting objectives, process, time constraints, and technical developments are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Water <b>diversions</b> in California, used {{primarily}} for agricultural, municipal, and industrial applications, {{have been considered}} a possi-ble culprit in the decline of many California fishes. In 1991, the Cali-fornia Department of Fish and Game (DFG) initiated a study using the Global Positioning System (GPS) to inventory water <b>diversions.</b> The initial focus was on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta) and the Suisun Marsh, then continued to the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River Basin, The inventory was to find, quantify, describe, and categorize <b>diversions</b> along waterways where Califor-nia fish may be affected by water <b>diversions.</b> As of April 1997, 3, 356 <b>diversions</b> have been located and mapped in a Geographical Infor-mation System (GIS). Approximately 98. 5 % of the <b>diversions</b> identi-fied were either unscreened or screened insufficiently to prevent fish entrainment. The GPS data were post-processed to provide a hori-zontal accuracy of ± 5 meters. The information was primarily col-lected by visual inspection of <b>diversions</b> on the stream bank. Information is maintained in a Microsoft Access database...|$|R
5|$|En {{route to}} his weekly squash game, a traffic <b>diversion</b> reminds Perowne of the anti-war protests {{occurring}} that day.

When Perowne refuses, Baxter {{and his two}} companions become aggressive. Noticing symptoms in Baxter's behaviour, Perowne quickly recognises the onset of Huntington's disease. Though he is punched in the sternum, Perowne manages to escape unharmed by distracting Baxter with discussions of his disease.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, the entrances to the two outer <b>diversion</b> tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner <b>diversion</b> tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works. The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|General E. P. Scammon led the December expedition, {{which was}} a <b>diversion</b> with mixed results. The purpose of the <b>diversion</b> was to draw Confederate forces away from a Union force led by General Averell, which was {{conducting}} a raid on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad near Salem, Virginia. Although Scammon captured Lewisburg, he soon retreated—making the situation for Averell more difficult. Beginning December 1863, the regiment {{became part of the}} 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, Army of West Virginia.|$|E
40|$|Large {{amounts of}} water are {{diverted}} from the Verde River and Wet Beaver Creek for agricultural irrigation in the Verde Valley. Fish populations in two irrigation <b>diversions</b> were sampled and fish were collected during a one year period to determine habitat suitability, the relative abundance, and fate of fishes. The most abundant species found in these <b>diversions</b> were red shiners and smallmouth bass. Irrigation <b>diversions</b> generally did not provide habitat suitable for fish and did not support large fish communities. Frequent drawdowns and irrigation of fields limited the amounts of suitable habitat in the <b>diversions.</b> Most fish present in the <b>diversions</b> during drawdowns became stranded in shallow pools and were subject to predation by raccoons, herons, kingfishers and man...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} used {{valuation}} techniques {{to predict the}} potential effect of environmental improvements on human use of coastal areas, {{but there is a}} lack of post hoc empirical evidence that these policies indeed affect the way people use coastal areas. A panel data approach is developed to statistically determine how storm drain <b>diversions</b> affected attendance at 26 beaches in Southern California. This study uses a 10 -year time series of data to conduct a statistical analysis of attendance at beaches with and without <b>diversions</b> and before and after the <b>diversions</b> were installed, while controlling for all observable, confounding factors. Results indicate that beach attendance increased at beaches with <b>diversions</b> compared to those that did not have <b>diversions</b> (between 350, 000 and 860, 000 visits annually at a 95 % confidence interval). Establishing this link between mitigation policies and human use patterns can lead to better management of coastal areas. PublishedN/...|$|R

5|$|At 02:00 on 13 November, two squadrons of ship's boats made amphibious landings: a small force under Lieutenant Samuel Leslie landed to {{the north}} of the emplaced positions, acting as a <b>diversion</b> while the main body of the expeditionary force landed to the south under Lieutenant Colonel Smith. Leslie's <b>diversion</b> distracted the Arab defenders, but enough {{remained}} in the southern defences to make a significant counterattack on Smith's beachhead. Cannon fire from the ship's boats covering the landing drove the Arabs back, and Smith ordered his men to advance with their bayonets fixed, pushing into the town and driving out the Arabs house by house. To cover their advance, Smith's men set fire to the buildings in their path, which created a pall of smoke under cover of which Smith was able to storm and capture the Sheik's palace.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposal}} was strongly opposed by both environmentalists {{as well as}} local residents. The economy of southeastern British Columbia is strongly dependent on tourism, with the Columbia River, including Columbia Lake and Windermere Lake, being very popular for summer swimming and boating activities. <b>Diversion</b> of the glacier-fed Kootenay River would have resulted in the Columbia River becoming much deeper and colder, flooding riverside communities and damaging tourism. At {{the opposite end of the}} scale, it would dry the bed of the Kootenay River downstream of Canal Flats, cutting off water supply to residents of the upper Kootenay Valley and invalidating the effectiveness of Libby Dam, whose construction was to begin in a few years. As a result, this proposed river <b>diversion</b> was never undertaken.|$|E
