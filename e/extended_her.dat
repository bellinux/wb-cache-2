5|$|After Christmas, Neuner won both {{individual}} races in Oberhof – her World Cup wins 27 and 28. In the women’s relay, she incurred 4 penalties {{in the final}} shooting, which foiled a likely German victory. Neuner suffered {{one of the biggest}} mishaps of her career, when she fired on the wrong targets in the Nove Mesto pursuit, dropping from first to seventh place. She recovered quickly by winning the sprint race in Antholz one week later. In February, Neuner claimed a double sprint and pursuit victory in Oslo despite suffering from a cold, which forced her to withdraw from the mass start. At the last World Cup stop before the world championships in Kontiolahti, she reached her sixth sprint win of the season, and <b>extended</b> <b>her</b> World Cup lead over Darya Domracheva.|$|E
5|$|From June 2000 until 21 April 2004, Tula {{underwent}} overhaul at the Zvezdochka shipyard, Severodvinsk, {{the third}} boat after Verkhoturie (K-51) and Ekaterinburg (K-84). The overhaul <b>extended</b> <b>her</b> service life by ten years, and {{allowed her to}} carry R-29RMU Sineva missiles. She conducted sea trials in early 2006 and re-entered service shortly thereafter, despite plans {{to do so in}} 2005. Tula post-overhaul operational history is characterised by a number of missile launches, the first of which occurred on 17 December 2007, when she launched a Sineva missile aimed at the Kura Test Range in the Kamchatka Peninsula. Within eight days, Tula launched another missile, again aimed at Kura; both tests were successful.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, the Ministry of Works asked Jones {{to conduct}} an {{excavation}} at Linford, a gravel pit {{near the village of}} Mucking on the Thames Estuary. The site had been discovered in aerial photographs taken by Kenneth St Joseph and confirmed in a small fieldwalking survey by the Thurrock Local History Society. These initial investigations resulted in the site being designated a Scheduled Monument under the Ancient Monuments Act 1931 and, since it was threatened by gravel extraction, prompted the Ministry to commission an exploratory excavation. Jones quickly concluded that the crop marks at Mucking represented an extensive site with Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and early Medieval remains. On that basis, the Ministry <b>extended</b> <b>her</b> contract and initiated a full excavation of the site.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for Arular, the debut album by M.I.A., {{took place during}} 2003 and 2004, and the album was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} September 2004. Legal issues relating to the use of samples delayed this release, however, first to December and then into 2005. During the recording process, M.I.A. met DJ Diplo, and expressed an interest in working with him on a track for the album. Although their initial recording sessions together proved fruitless, Diplo conceived the idea of using the existing vocal tracks recorded for the album to produce a mixtape which could be used to promote the delayed full-length album. M.I.A. <b>extended</b> <b>her</b> stay in the United States and the two artists produced the mixtape at his home studio.|$|E
5|$|The {{scores were}} tied fifteen times, and {{at no point}} were the Australians more than five points in front.

Crispin was sent to the free-throw line where she <b>extended</b> <b>her</b> team's lead to 47–43. A {{technical}} foul saw her straight back to the free-throw line to make it 48–43, the Gliders' biggest lead of the game.

The following year after accepting her first Academy Award for To Each His Own, deHavilland was approached backstage by Fontaine, who <b>extended</b> <b>her</b> hand to congratulate her; deHavilland {{turned away from her}} sister.

5|$|Carey has {{expressed}} her belief in God and her connection between music and spirituality, {{and felt the}} album was finally a way to portray her mysticism into music. After the success of Carey's previous effort, Music Box, there was speculation of a new project in the works; however {{it was not until}} October 1994, only one month before the album's release, that Billboard announced Carey would be releasing a holiday album for the Christmas season. Initially, critics were shocked; they did not know how Carey would fare as an entertainer, as she had previously only been viewed as a pop star. Nevertheless, Carey, unaffected by the speculation, continued working on, and promoting the album in high spirits, confident in her work. The idea proved to be wise, earning Carey recognition in various markets including Christian radio and contemporary R stations, as well as <b>extended</b> <b>her</b> fame in Japan, where the album experienced much of its success.|$|E
