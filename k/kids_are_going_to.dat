5000|$|Screenwriter Chris Webb, {{a student}} {{participant}} and adult writing adviser, wrote, [...] "I {{think the thing}} that makes BOC really work is that it is done by high school kids, and the audience can tell that it was, and the show never hid the truth. So as an audience watches it, there is an inherent suspense as to whether the <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pull off a scene. Sometimes they do, and then don't - occasionally within the same scene. Comedy relies on tension, and that suspense, that tension, can make the show very very funny. But even when it doesn't work, the show is still fascinating to watch. All because of the high school element." ...|$|E
