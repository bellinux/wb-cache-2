5|$|Although many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward {{to explain how the}} ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include systemic acidosis (high levels of acid in the blood), electrolyte changes and <b>hypoglycaemia</b> (low blood glucose). Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E
5|$|Variations on the Johns Hopkins {{protocol}} are common. The initiation can {{be performed}} using outpatient clinics rather than requiring a stay in hospital. Often there is no initial fast (fasting {{increases the risk of}} acidosis and <b>hypoglycaemia</b> and weight loss). Rather than increasing meal sizes over the three-day initiation, some institutions maintain meal size but alter the ketogenic ratio from 2:1 to 4:1.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is not a}} benign, holistic {{or natural}} treatment for epilepsy; as with any serious medical therapy, there may be complications. These are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery. Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include constipation, low-grade acidosis and <b>hypoglycaemia</b> {{if there is an}} initial fast. Raised levels of lipids in the blood affect up to 60% of children and cholesterol levels may increase by around 30%. This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and, if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio. Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many micronutrients.|$|E
25|$|Hyponatraemia is {{an almost}} {{universal}} finding due to water retention and a shift in intracellular sodium transport from inhibition of Na/K ATPase. <b>Hypoglycaemia</b> (due to depleted hepatic glycogen store and hyperinsulinaemia), hypokalaemia, hypophosphataemia and Metabolic alkalosis are often present, independent of renal function. Lactic acidosis occurs predominantly in paracetomol (also known as acetaminophen) overdose.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{epinephrine}} secretion {{is observed}} in pheochromocytoma, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction {{and to a}} lesser degree in benign essential familial tremor. A general increase in sympathetic neural activity is usually accompanied by increased adrenaline secretion, but there is selectivity during hypoxia and <b>hypoglycaemia,</b> when the ratio of adrenaline to noradrenaline is considerably increased. Therefore, there must be some autonomy of the adrenal medulla {{from the rest of the}} sympathetic system.|$|E
25|$|When oral hypoglycemic {{agents are}} used in MODY, the sulfonylureas remain the oral {{medication}} of first resort. When {{compared to patients with}} type 2 diabetes, MODY patients are often more sensitive to sulphonylureas, such that a lower dose should be used to initiate treatment to avoid <b>hypoglycaemia.</b> Patients with MODY less often suffer from obesity and insulin resistance than those with ordinary type 2 diabetes (for whom insulin sensitizers like metformin or the thiazolidinediones are often preferred over the sulfonylureas).|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid {{levels are}} {{increased}} in the brains of children infected {{with a range of}} bacterial infections of the central nervous system (CNS), of poliovirus patients, and of Lyme disease with CNS involvement patients. In addition, raised quinolinic acid levels have been found in traumatic CNS injury patients, patients suffering from cognitive decline with ageing, hyperammonaemia patients, <b>hypoglycaemia</b> patients, and systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Also, it has been found that people suffering from malaria and patients with olivopontocerebellar atrophy have raised quinolinic acid metabolism.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal {{reviewed}} R v Quick, {{which had}} dealt with an allegation of assault occasioning actual bodily harm not requiring proof of specific intent. That decision suggested {{that even if the}} <b>hypoglycaemia</b> was induced by some action or inaction by the accused, his defence will not necessarily fail. However, the judge in Bailey's trial had not directed the jury to consider that situation. The court also pointed out that self-induced incapacity, as in Bailey's case, may be evidence of recklessness sufficient to attach guilt for crimes of basic intent.|$|E
25|$|Bailey claimed at {{his trial}} {{that he had no}} memory of the attack and had been acting in a state of {{automatism}} caused by <b>hypoglycaemia</b> as he had not eaten since his last insulin dose. His general practitioner gave evidence that this might cause aggressive behaviour and loss of memory but was unlikely to have caused the sudden loss of awareness claimed by the defendant. The prosecution's case was that although theoretically possible, this was not what had happened. They argued that Bailey had armed himself with the iron bar and gone to the boyfriend's house with the intention of harming him. Evidence was given that shortly after the attack he had been interviewed by the police and seemed to behave quite normally.|$|E
25|$|It {{is also a}} {{moderate}} inhibitor of CYP2D6 and also a substrate for CYP2D6 and hence can inhibit its own metabolism. It can also inhibit the clearance of CYP2D6 substrates such as dextromethorphan and hence also potentiate their effects. Other drugs like codeine and tamoxifen which require CYP2D6-mediated activation into their respective active metabolites may have their therapeutic effects attenuated. Likewise CYP2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine or fluoxetine can reduce chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase serum levels of chlorpromazine and hence potentially also its adverse effects. Chlorpromazine also reduces phenytoin levels and increases valproic acid levels. It also reduces propranolol clearance and antagonises the therapeutic effects of antidiabetic agents, levodopa (a Parkinson's medication. This is likely {{due to the fact}} that chlorpromazine antagonises the D2 receptor which is one of the receptors dopamine, a levodopa metabolite, activates), amfetamines and anticoagulants. It may also interact with anticholinergic drugs such as orphenadrine to produce <b>hypoglycaemia</b> (low blood sugar).|$|E
25|$|Doxepin {{should not}} be used within 14days of using a monoamine oxidase {{inhibitor}} (MAOIs) such as phenelzine due to the potential for hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome to develop. Its use in those taking potent CYP2D6 inhibitors such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, bupropion, and quinidine is recommended against due to the potential for its accumulation in the absence of full CYP2D6 catalytic activity. Hepatic enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates are advised against in patients receiving TCAs like doxepin due to the potential for problematically rapid metabolism of doxepin to occur in these individuals. Sympathomimetic agents may have their effects potentiated by TCAs like doxepin. Doxepin also may potentiate the adverse effects of anticholinergic agents such as benztropine, atropine and hyoscine (scopolamine). Tolazamide, when used in conjunction with doxepin has been associated with a case of severe <b>hypoglycaemia</b> in a type II diabetic individual. Cimetidine may influence the absorption of doxepin. Alcohol may potentiate some of the CNS depressant effects of doxepin. Antihypertensive agents may have their effects mitigated by doxepin. Cotreatment with CNS depressants such as the benzodiazepines can cause additive CNS depression. Co-treatment with thyroid hormones may also increase the potential for adverse reactions.|$|E

500|$|Diagnosis {{of central}} nervous system oxygen {{toxicity}} in divers prior to seizure is difficult as the symptoms of visual disturbance, ear problems, dizziness, confusion and nausea can be due to many factors common to the underwater environment such as narcosis, congestion and coldness.

2500|$|Loss of AMPK {{has been}} {{reported}} to alter the sensitivity of glucose sensing cells, through poorly defined mechanisms. Loss of the AMPKα2 subunit in pancreatic beta cells and hypothalamic neurons decreases the sensitivity of these cells to changes in extracellular glucose concentration. Moreover, exposure of rats to recurrent bouts of insulin induced hypoglycaemia/glucopenia, reduces the activation of AMPK within the hypothalamus, whilst also suppressing the counterregulatory response to <b>hypoglycaemia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Artesunate {{administered}} by intravenous or intramuscular injection has proven superior to quinine in large, randomised controlled trials in both adults [...] and children. Combining all trials comparing these two drugs, artesunate {{is associated with}} a mortality rate that is approximately 30% lower than that of quinine. Reasons for this difference include reduced incidence of <b>hypoglycaemia,</b> easier administration and more rapid action against circulating and sequestered parasites. Artesunate is now recommended by the WHO for treatment of all cases of severe malaria. Effective treatment with ACT (Artemisinin Combination Therapy) has proven to lower the morbidity and mortality from malaria within two years by around 70%.|$|E

There may be dramatic symptoms accumulating in succession, which demand rigorous and experienced evaluation. The seizure may be very dramatic, with symptoms accumulating in succession, convulsions may occur and a child who becomes unresponsive and flaccid demands rigorous and experienced evaluation. The most prominent acute disorders in the differential diagnosis include encephalitis or an encephalopathic state from causes such as infections, metabolic derangement (either inborn error or others such as <b>hypoglycaemia),</b> raised intracranial pressure and so forth.
