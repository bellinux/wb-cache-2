25|$|Hunting RPGs are a type {{of action}} RPG subgenre {{featuring}} the player and an optional team of up to three other players hunting down larger monsters with a set amount of time, using weapons crafted from the materials extracted from the map and/or from the monsters themselves. Unlike most RPG genres, the monsters <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>health</b> bars or hit points, but have stronger attack and defense stats, forcing the players to use survival items and coordinated strategies to eliminate a specific monster. First appeared in Capcom's Monster Hunter franchise, these games later expanded the hunting RPG genre into other games as well, such as Bandai Namco Entertainment's God Eater franchise.|$|E

30|$|It {{has been}} shown that a fit between workers’ {{competencies}} and job demands with regard to task complexity {{plays an important role in}} preventing age related diseases (Andel et al. 2005; Volkholz 2006). Excessive work-load or too few work demands pose a risk to health. Not only being under or over challenged is negatively correlated with health, excessive work demands in one work field and an under challenge in another field can accumulate to an even higher health risk (Volkholz 2008). Investigating the fit/misfit of work demands and abilities and its relation to health, Volkholz (2008) revealed that in case of a fit 43 % of the employees <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>health</b> problems. In the group of participants with under challenging work demands only 35 % <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>health</b> problems and in case of a possible excessive work demands only 18 % <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>health</b> problems. A double misfit of work related demands and abilities lead to <b>no</b> <b>health</b> problems in 14 %, 20 % were unable to work and 32 % had more than four problems with their health (Volkholz 2008).|$|R

It called for more random checks and robust enforcement of the scheme and states that [...] "the {{use of the word}} 'pedigree' should be tied to a high standard of breeding (for health and welfare) across the board with the KC not just with the few that decide to join the Accredited Breeder Scheme (ABS)".|$|E

40|$|Examining committee: Laura Leete, chair, Renee IrvinThis study {{examines}} how income volatility in households affects {{their level of}} medical deprivation. Using SIPP data from 2002 - 2003, the study compares the relationship between medical hardship of households and measures of income volatility, such as the variation of average income, and the largest monthly negative income shock, {{over a period of}} 12 months. The study also examines the interaction between medical deprivation and the percent of months in which household members <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>health</b> insurance. Using a logistic regression model, this study shows that income volatility as well as household members <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>health</b> insurance affect the predicted probability of medical deprivation. Gaining a stronger understanding of the interaction between income fluctuations and material hardships, including medical deprivation, will allow policy makers to better understand influences on the well-being of low-income families...|$|R

50|$|Following the U.S. {{invasion}} of Afghanistan the Ministry of Health, {{along with the}} World Health Organisation reconstructed the health sector. At the time, at least 70% of the Afghan population was dependent on health services provided by the international community.

50|$|Not all flakes are dandruff. For example, {{some can}} merely be product buildup on the scalp skin.

50|$|There {{has been}} {{concern that the}} study will collect health {{information}} without addressing the medical needs of the workers, who may <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>health</b> insurance. The study's lead investigator, Dale Sandler, said in 2011 that participants who are found by the researchers to need medical care will be referred to local health-care providers who offer free or reduced-cost treatment. Local people say that finding such medical care is not easy, and that the workers' health should be prioritized over data collection.|$|E
