25|$|At Kate's Bridge, {{the road}} crossed the River Glen. Until the 1820s the road still {{used the same}} {{crossing}} point despite the river's having moved from it at some time, probably well over a thousand years before. At Park Wood, the road appears to have {{come close to the}} Car Dyke but this is not well supported by evidence. From near Thurlby crossroads, the Roman line <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> point at which Bourne Abbey was later built on it.|$|E
25|$|Borg {{went on to}} lose to McEnroe at the 1981 US Open. After that defeat, Borg {{walked off}} the court {{and out of the}} stadium before the ceremonies and press conference had begun, and <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> airport. There are reports that Borg {{received}} threats after his semifinal win over Connors. In later years, Borg apologized to McEnroe. The 1981 US Open would be the Swede's last Grand Slam final. Major tournaments and tour organizers were enforcing a new rule; by 1982, that players had to play at least 10 official tournaments per year. However, Borg wanted to curtail his schedule after many years of winning so often. Although he felt in good condition physically, he recognized that the relentless drive to win and defy tour organizers had begun to fade.|$|E
25|$|On March 14, the {{monitors}} told Palestinian authorities {{at the prison}} they were getting their car fixed. Then they <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Israeli checkpoint on the road out of Jericho. At around 09:00, Israeli soldiers stationed at the checkpoint spotted {{the monitors}} leaving the city. Immediately after, special forces, backed up by tanks, converged on the prison in order to force the wanted men out. At around 09:30, some 100 Israeli soldiers were surrounding the prison. By {{the end of the}} siege, the IDF had committed a force of approximately 1,000 soldiers from an armored division. Reports from the scene said 50 jeeps, three tanks, and an armored bulldozer pushed into Jericho, and two helicopters were flying overhead. At the time of the raid, there were a total of 200 prisoners and guards in the prison.|$|E
60|$|In half a minute, the lugger's {{foresail}} again rose; and {{she continued}} <b>the</b> chase, <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> brig.|$|R
5000|$|Gökböri {{became known}} as a {{reliable}} and skilled military leader. Saladin's secretary, the historian Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani, described him as: [...] "... the audacious, the hero of well thought out projects, <b>the</b> lion who <b>heads</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> target, the most reliable and firmest chief." ...|$|R
5000|$|At Harwich the A120 {{passes to}} the north of <b>the</b> town, <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cargo ports, whereas the old route can be seen on a map clearly passing through the centre of the town.|$|R
500|$|... "We {{were under}} the impression– {{he looked like he}} was going down, but we didn't hear any {{mechanical}} difficulty. We couldn't figure out why an American Airlines plane would be so low in downtown Manhattan. We sort of expected him to veer off and go into the Hudson. But he just rose a little bit, his altitude, leveled off, and he was <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Trade Center. So just before he got to the Trade Center, it seemed as though he gained power. We were just watching this airplane on target for the World Trade Center. All of a sudden, boom! He disappears into the Trade Center." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tambor {{returned}} to Pearl Harbor on 15 December 1943 and held refresher training during {{the remainder of}} the month. She began her ninth war patrol on 5 January 1944. Her assigned area was in the East China Sea. She sighted a Natori-class cruiser on 22 January, but lost contact in a rain squall. Six days later, she contacted a convoy of nine ships heading north and tracked it until 01:56 the next day. She then fired two torpedoes at a cargo ship in a surface attack. Both hit and sent Shuntai Maru down by the bow. An escort <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> submarine and ramming seemed inevitable. Tambor opened fire with her aft 20-millimeter gun and turned hard to port causing the escort to pass [...] astern. After evading the escort, the submarine tried to regain contact with the convoy but failed.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, {{after two}} or three broadsides {{exchanged}} with Alliance, less than 20 minutes after the first shot, Captain Piercy was astonished to see his opponent (with just one of the little [...] shots from the Countess of Scarborough stuck in its tough timberwork) move away to rejoin Pallas, which was still waiting for an opportunity to be useful. Landais later claimed that his opponent had sailed away under cover of smoke. Piercy, his ship relatively unharmed, and out of range of any of the four Americans, <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> main battle, {{to see if he could}} help Serapis, but Jones’s close-quarters policy meant that to intervene now would be madness. Quite possibly shots fired by the Countess of Scarborough at the Bonhomme Richard would hit Serapis, or worse still, massive [...] shots from Serapis could accidentally hit the Countess of Scarborough. Instead, Piercy simply gave the impression that he was going to intervene, trying to attract the attention of Alliance and Pallas. Cottineau saw the potential danger (or responded to a request by Landais) and quickly steered towards the Countess of Scarborough, so Piercy slowly retreated, sailing with the wind.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} the Helena was making good time through the water again and picking up {{momentum}} <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cloud. The wheel was still turned hard left and I {{had no idea where}} either the Juneau or the San Francisco were. Total silence reigned in the pilot house and on the wings of the bridge.|$|R
5000|$|Soon after, the Cotes {{return on}} snowmobiles, chasing the {{creature}} under the ice. The creature and <b>the</b> men <b>head</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> family. The creature snags {{all of their}} lines and their rods break. The Cotes are frustrated {{that they did not}} catch the creature. The two groups socialize and the men offer to fish with them, but the Pelletiers decline. Steve then shows the family their trailer. While walking back to their fishing hole, the family spots <b>the</b> creature <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> men. Steven Jr. attempts to reel it in, but it pulls him down. Steve grabs his ankles, and Ray grabs Steve and they all pull Steven Jr. up. They notice that he has a huge gash on his arm. Steve takes him inside for [...] "a hot shower and a cold beer".|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} American Civil War, preacher Josiah Gray (Joel McCrea) {{arrives in the}} town of Walesburg. He <b>heads</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> saloon to give his first sermon. When the patrons laugh at him, he pulls out two guns, cowing the men into listening.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh for Giles, {{with his}} rifle!" [...] thought the youth, as the agile creatures passed within {{less than a}} hundred yards of him, and <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pass of the Eagle Cliff.|$|E
60|$|Martin ran {{and looked}} through the bars. It was true enough. There they came, fifty men or more, a whole company, <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> factory, which it was thought might be garrisoned for defence.|$|E
60|$|Peter {{watched him}} out of sight, sighed, started for the dear Old Briar-patch, stopped, sighed again, and then <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Smiling Pool. Grandfather Frog was there on his big green lily-pad, and Peter wasted no time.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> pile <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bonfire {{is quite}} high, and the Doctor {{tells them to}} go ahead and light it. The idea is that Georgi is hacked into the system, and can tell <b>the</b> creatures to <b>head</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> flames, which won't kill them, but will stop them.|$|R
40|$|Picture {{the person}} who comes into <b>the</b> library and <b>heads</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> magazines. She beelines for People, maybe spends some time with Vanity Fair. She {{may or may not}} tear a few pages from the copy when it suits her needs. She loves celebrities: she’ll read InStyle if you have it, Cosmopolitan if you [ [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|Rimmer's pod, {{discovered}} to be looted and on auto-pilot, <b>heads</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> closest S3 planet, {{on the other}} side of a wormhole, and when it arrives Rimmer decides to use the terraforming equipment to create a paradise. He manages to clone himself, hoping for female company, but instead begins an entire new race of Rimmer-clones who eventually turn against him and imprison him in a dungeon.|$|R
60|$|The camel <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{column and}} the shots behind multiplied. The {{children}} of the desert had arranged that most uncomfortable of surprises, a dawn attack for the English troops, and were getting their distance by snap- shots at the only moving object without the square.|$|E
60|$|So after {{warning the}} Quacks {{to remain in}} the pond of Paddy the Beaver if they would be safe, Blacky bade them good-by and flew away. He <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Green Meadows and Farmer Brown's cornfield. A little of that yellow corn would make a good breakfast.|$|E
60|$|Blacky <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Green Forest, chuckling as he flew. He {{knew that}} those Ducks {{would not return}} until after dark. He had saved them this time, {{and he was so}} happy he didn't even notice the Black Shadows. And the hunter stood up and shook his fist at Blacky the Crow.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the signal}} of the Khan's death reaches the field, {{most of the}} Mongols {{withdraw}} in order to hold a kurultai. However, a small force remains under Sable's command. They break through the weakened defenders and <b>head</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Temple of Marduk and the massive sphere, dubbed the [...] "Eye of Marduk". Bisesa confronts Sable in the Temple and incapacitates her, but Ruddy is fatally shot.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> {{problems}} <b>for</b> convoy PQ17 started {{early on}} the morning of 4 July 1942, with the appearance of a copper-yellow warhead of a torpedo, clearly visible just {{below the surface of the}} sea. The freighter [...] sounded her siren to warn the leading ships in column eight, but it was too late: <b>the</b> weapon was <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> midship section of the Liberty ship , at the head of that column.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{truth was}} that at every squall the wind hauled aft a little, till {{gradually}} the ship came to be <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> coast, without a single soul in her being aware of it. Wilmot himself confessed {{that he had not}} been near <b>the</b> standard compass <b>for</b> an hour. He might well have confessed! The first thing he knew was the man on the look-out shouting blue murder forward there.|$|R
60|$|Then Duane, gliding {{silently and}} swiftly through the willows, heard no more from his pursuers. He <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> river. Threading a passage through a willow brake {{was an old}} task for him. Many days and nights {{had gone to the}} {{acquiring}} of a skill that might have been envied by an Indian.|$|E
60|$|Digger {{had been}} so intent on his own affairs that he hadn't noticed {{anything}} unusual, but when Old Man Coyote mentioned the matter he remembered that Blacky the Crow <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Green Forest every morning. Several times he had seen Sammy Jay flying {{in the same direction}} as if in a great hurry to get somewhere.|$|E
6000|$|As soon as Bowser came in sight, Blacky gave {{what was}} {{intended}} for a cheery caw and then <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> place he had started for that morning, giving no more thought to Bowser the Hound. You see, he knew that Bowser would shortly come to a road. [...] "If he doesn't know enough to follow that road, he deserves to starve," [...] thought Blacky.|$|E
6000|$|... "According to my calculation, father, {{we ought}} to be full two hundred miles from land, and <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> Abaco, <b>the</b> northernmost of these islands." ...|$|R
60|$|With some difficulty, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sea {{was getting}} up, they lowered the sail and mast and, getting out the oars, turned her <b>head</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> shore. Both were {{accustomed}} to rowing in still water, but they found that this was very different work. After struggling at <b>the</b> oars <b>for</b> a couple of hours, they both agreed {{that they were a}} good deal farther away from the land than when they began.|$|R
50|$|He later {{commanded}} several voyages to the East Indies, {{setting up}} trading posts on various islands. On May 1, 1598 Van Heemskerck {{set out from}} Texel in a fleet of eight ships bound <b>for</b> <b>the</b> East and returned on May 19, 1600. He sailed out again the following year in a combined fleet of thirteen ships with Admiral Wolphert Harmensz. The fleet split at the Azores with Harmensz going to Mauritius and Van Heemskerck <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Moluccas.|$|R
60|$|Now {{as soon as}} Sammy {{was sure}} that Old Man Coyote couldn't see him, he <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Green Forest and the hill where Prickly Porky, Jimmy Skunk, Unc' Billy Possum, and Peter and Mrs. Peter Rabbit were waiting. As he flew, he saw Reddy Fox and old Granny Fox {{stretched}} flat behind an old log some distance away, but where they could see all that might happen.|$|E
60|$|So Peter and Jumper and Chatterer and Happy Jack thanked Old Mother Nature {{for what}} she had told them and scampered away. Peter <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{far corner of the}} Old Orchard where he was sure he would find Johnny Chuck. He couldn't get there fast enough, for he wanted {{to be the first to}} tell Johnny Chuck that he was a Squirrel. You see he didn't believe that Johnny knew it.|$|E
60|$|The huge, mouse-coloured Brahmini bull of {{the ward}} was {{shouldering}} {{his way through}} the many-coloured crowd, a stolen plantain hanging out of his mouth. He <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> shop, well knowing his privileges as a sacred beast, lowered his head, and puffed heavily along the line of baskets ere making his choice. Up flew Kim's hard little heel and caught him on his moist blue nose. He snorted indignantly, and walked away across the tram-rails, his hump quivering with rage.|$|E
50|$|Out of jail, {{and armed}} with a gun {{supplied}} by King, Raj, full of rage, <b>heads</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wedding and <b>straight</b> away shoots Kishan, supposedly killing him on the spot. However, it turns out, the bullets were all fake blanks, planted by King in collaboration with Kishan himself. Kishan gets up and reveals that the wedding was actually supposed to be between Sanjana and the surprise groom, Raj himself, much to the embarrassment of Raj.|$|R
6000|$|Presently {{my brother}} shouted and I {{looked up to}} see him pulling on a fish. There was a big splash in the water and then I saw his line running out. <b>The</b> fish was <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{framework}} on which I had been seated and I knew if he ever did get there he would break the line. All of a sudden I saw the fish he had hooked. And he reached the framework all right! ...|$|R
50|$|Once in prison, Gordon gives Bruce all the {{documentation}} on the crimes. Bruce toils {{day and night}} {{to try to figure}} out how he can get the Ripper. Just one day before the execution, Bruce learns the identity of the Ripper by discovering he had the skill of a surgeon and used a knife that belonged to the medical group who worked with his father. Bruce escapes from prison with the help of Alfred and <b>heads</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Ripper.|$|R
