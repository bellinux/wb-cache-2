500|$|In his youth, {{influenced}} by his uncle, former Liberal Lord Mayor of Adelaide Sir Jonathan Cain, Dunstan was {{a supporter of}} the conservative Liberal and Country League (LCL) and handed out how-to-vote cards for the party at state elections. Dunstan later said of his involvement with the Liberals: [...] "I do not call it snobbery to deride the Establishment in South Australia, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> I was brought up into it, and <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> it gave me a pain." [...] When asked of his roots, he said [...] "I'm a refugee from it and thank God for somewhere honest to flee to!" ...|$|E
500|$|Being as skeptical as Boyajian was, {{she finally}} decided to take SETI's {{approach}} and allow herself to {{have a bit of}} fun in hypothesizing what the light pattern could have been. In her Ted Talk she joked: [...] "Another idea that's one of my personal favorites is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet. Now, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> this would produce a lot of dust that we don't observe. But if we're already invoking aliens in this explanation, then who is to say they didn't efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{trial was}} Captain Fabbroni's finest moment. He testified in 21 {{hearings}} and his testimony filled 285 pages. He accused the police, politicians {{and even the}} judiciary of being involved with the Camorra. Alfano claimed he was innocent. [...] "I am the victim of yellow journalism," [...] he told the judge. [...] "I have been ruined by the Carabinieri. The story that I have been {{the head of the}} Camorra is a legend. I was neither its head nor its tail. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> I have committed some excesses. What youth of my social class in Naples has not?" ...|$|E

500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} Bosley Crowther noted {{the film was}} a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likeable young lads who are {{constantly}} amazed at the attention they receive and who want {{nothing more than a}} little peace and quiet; however, {{they have to deal with}} screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them. In fact their biggest problem is McCartney's elderly, but [...] "clean" [...] grandfather, played by Wilfrid Brambell. The New Yorker critic Brendan Gill wrote: [...] "Though I don't pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so fascinating to so many scores of millions of people, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> I feel a certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|On 7 May, Benfica {{played their}} final match {{of the season}} at Estádio da Mata Real. Benfica's Manuel Fernandes scored first but could not prevent Paços de Ferreira scoring three second-half goals, thus losing the game. Benfica ended the season in third place, missing out on the title and an {{automatic}} place in the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League. Despite winning both games against Porto, the closest Benfica had come from them was on the 18 and 19 match-days, with only three points. Benfica closed the season 12 points behind the leader and five from Sporting. Of the Big Three, Benfica conceded the most goals (29) and scored the second-highest number of goals (51), with the worst goal-average (+22). Koeman wanted to fulfil his contract with Benfica, but after negotiations with the management and sudden interest from PSV, Benfica opted to release him on mutual terms. Koeman thanked Luís Filipe Vieira and José Veiga for their support in face of repeated criticism, and said, [...] "This is very big club, but you cannot win all the time, although <b>I</b> <b>admit,</b> <b>that</b> in the Primeira Liga, {{he did not do}} everything he could. We could have done better. But I say, It was a pleasure being here, now my career will continue elsewhere." ...|$|E

2500|$|Patricia Neal had {{a problem}} saying the phrase, though {{she was proud of}} the film overall. [...] "I do think it's the best science fiction film ever made, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> I sometimes had a difficult time keeping a straight face. Michael would patiently watch me bite my lips to avoid giggling and ask, with true British reserve, 'Is that the way you intend to play it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Brood's outspoken {{statements}} in the press about sex and drug use brought him into the Dutch public arena even more than his music. He was romantically involved with the German singer Nina Hagen, with whom he appeared in the 1979 film Cha-Cha. He is reputed {{to be the subject}} of her song [...] "Herrmann Hiess Er" [...] (English title [...] "Herrmann Was His Name") from the 1979 Unbehagen album, a song about a drug addict. Brood relished the media attention and became the most famous hard drug user in the Netherlands. [...] "It is quite common for an artist to use drugs, but not for him to tell everybody. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> it scared me that my popularity could make people start using drugs," [...] he once said in an interview.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1959, Matos {{denounced the}} {{direction}} the revolution was taking by giving openly anti-communist speeches in Camagüey. This launched a months-long dispute between him and Castro, then Prime Minister of Cuba, When Castro replaced President Manuel Urrutia with the more radical Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado, Matos tendered his resignation {{in a letter to}} Castro. On 26 July, Castro and Matos met at the Hilton Hotel in Havana, where, according to Matos, Castro told him: [...] "Your resignation is not acceptable at this point. We still have too much work to do. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> Raúl [...] and Che [...] are flirting with Marxism... but you have the situation under control... Forget about resigning... But if in a while you believe the situation is not changing, {{you have the right to}} resign." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "“The Bear and the Bow” {{is a really}} {{compelling}} episode for Once Upon a Time, and <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> I wasn’t necessarily expecting it to be. However, the separate trajectories towards heroism and self-confidence for both Merida and Gold were genuinely engrossing... The plot (The deception from Arthur) thickens, and it didn’t feel like {{part of the same}} episode {{as the rest of the}} story, considering how singularly focused it is on the Gold/Merida arcs. But it was necessary if next week’s episode is going to kick off the search for this mysterious person. So I can’t really complain about it. All in all, I thought “The Bear and the Bow” delivered, as Once Upon a Time continues what is gradually becoming one of my favorite first-halves of any season in some time." ...|$|E
2500|$|... ou {{know that}} Berio used The Raw and the Cooked in his Sinfonia. A {{part of the}} text is recited, {{accompanied}} by the music. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> I did not grasp {{the reason for this}} choice. During an interview a musicologist asked me about it, and I answered that the book had just come out and the composer had probably used it because it was at hand. Now, a few months ago Berio, whom I don't know, sent me a very disgruntled letter. He had read the interview, several years after the fact, and assured me that the movement of this symphony offered the musical counterpart of the mythical transformation I was revealing. He included a book by a musicologist [...] who had demonstrated the fact. I apologized for the misunderstanding, which was, I said, the result of my lack of musical training, but I'm still baffled.|$|E
2500|$|Gillian Chung was {{the first}} starlet to make a public appearance. After a New Year celebration with fans on 11 February, she {{delivered}} a brief statement to the press in which she apologised for the hurt caused to those around her.(English translation: [...] "...This incident has {{caused a lot of}} turmoil and harm to me and people around me. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> I was so naive and silly in the past, but now I have grown up. I thank my company, my family and my friends for their blessing and support. This incident has caused a lot of [...] effects to the society which I deeply regret. In the future, I will continue to work hard, and face my life positively." [...] Emperor sought closure by stating that neither it nor any of its artists would be making any further statement about the incident. The press conference drew mixed response from the media and the public. An Apple Daily commentary was particularly scathing about the hypocrisy of Chung and of her management company for only obliquely hinting at her [...] "licentiousness". On 14 February, two new nude photographs surfaced [...] one featuring an unidentified woman fellating Chen, and another showed a woman lying on a bed.|$|E

2500|$|Westbrook did {{not return}} and made her final {{appearance}} as Sam on 24 January 2000. She has since confessed that her drug taking was the reason why she was written out. In her autobiography she comments, [...] "I wasn't fired this time, but let's just say when they {{gave me the opportunity}} to walk I took it. I was no longer interested in acting and that had become blatantly obvious to everyone on set. The soap was now being shown four times a week and it was impossible to balance the workload with my addiction [...] Not only had [...] destroyed my nose, but it was about to destroy my career again as well [...] The producers were tiring of my behaviour [...] When I did leave the production at the end of 1999 it was in fact a fairly mutual decision. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> had I begged the producers to let me stay this time I doubt if they would have allowed me to. But I was happy to go [...] Looking back to that point now it fills me with shame that I could have behaved in that way and let down so many people". Following her axing, Westbrook's eroded nasal septum was revealed to the public by the press, after she was photographed at the 2000 British Soap Awards.|$|E
