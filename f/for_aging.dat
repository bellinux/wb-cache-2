40|$|BACKGROUND: To enable {{adequate}} {{interpretation of}} growth measurements {{in the management}} of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), we assessed growth and its associated determinants in children with PAH. METHODS: We did a retrospective longitudinal study of height and body-mass index in reference to WHO growth standards by pooling data from four contemporary prospective registries of paediatric PAH representing 53 centres in 19 countries. The main outcome measures were median height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> and body-mass index <b>for</b> <b>age</b> percentiles and longitudinal deviation of height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> and body-mass index <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z scores from WHO standards. FINDINGS: 601 children were followed up for a median of 2 · 9 years (IQR 1 · 5 - 4 · 4). Baseline median height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> percentile was 26 (IQR 4 - 54) and baseline median body-mass index <b>for</b> <b>age</b> percentile was 41 (IQR 12 - 79). Mean height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score was significantly lower than the reference (- 0 · 81, 95 % CI - 0 · 93 to - 0 · 69; p< 0 · 0001), as was body-mass index <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score (- 0 · 12, - 0 · 25 to - 0 · 01; p= 0 · 047). Height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score was particularly decreased in young patients (aged ≤ 5 years) with idiopathic or hereditary PAH and in all patients with PAH associated with congenital heart disease. Although Z scores increased in some patients and decreased in others, we detected no significant trend in height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score (p= 0 · 57) or body-mass index <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score (p= 0 · 48) before taking account of covariates. Multivariable linear mixed effects modelling showed that age, cause of PAH, ex-prematurity, WHO functional class, trisomy 21, and time since diagnosis were associated with height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score, whereas age, ethnicity, and trisomy 21 were associated with body-mass index <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score. A favourable WHO functional class course was independently associated with increases in height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score. INTERPRETATION: PAH is associated with impaired growth, especially in younger children and those with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease. The degree of impairment is independently associated with cause of PAH and comorbidities, but also with disease severity and duration. Because a favourable clinical course was associated with catch-up growth, height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> could serve as an additional and globally available clinical parameter to monitor patients' clinical condition.
