Again, in science, such inferences are always made to some limited (sometimes extremely high) degree of probability and in this case {{absence of evidence}} is evidence of absence when the positive evidence should have been there but is not.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the many}} Gothic {{sculpture}}s {{from the early}} 16th century, the Archangel Gabriel, crucifixion and small sculpture of Christ sufferer by Master Paul have been preserved. The original sculpture of Calvary on beam of triumphal arch allegedly damaged fire in the 17th century. The monumental sculpture of the crucified has extremely high artistic quality and its dramatic expressive comprehension <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> {{of the fact that}} it was created under the influence of German art in the first half of the 14th century. From the Gothic wing altars on both sides 14 painted panels were preserved, originally belonged to the altar of St. Nicholas and the Virgin Mary. They are traditionally attributed to craftsman Peter and Albert Molers from Presov; they worked on them in 1497-1506. Older written sources mention also the panel painting of St. Anny Samotretia who got to Nemzeti Museum in Budapest. A Gothic temple facilities also include mural paintings on the north wall of the middle presbytery from the late 15th and the early 16th century, which displays a knight on horseback and female figures.|$|E
25|$|In biology, macro{{evolution}} {{refers to}} evolution above the species level while microevolution refers to changes within species. However, {{there is no}} fundamental distinction between these processes; small changes compound over time and eventually lead to speciation. Creationists argue that {{a finite number of}} discrete kinds were created, as described in the Book of Genesis, and these kinds determine the limits of variation. Early Creationists equated kinds with species, but most now accept that speciation can occur: not only <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> overwhelming for speciation, but the millions of species now in existence could not have fit in Noah's Ark. Created kinds identified by creationists are more generally on the level of the family (for example, Canidae), but the genus Homo is a separate kind. A Creationist systematics called Baraminology builds on the idea of created kind, calling it a baramin. While evolutionary systematics is used to explore relationships between organisms by descent, baraminology attempts to find discontinuities between groups of organisms. It employs many of the tools of evolutionary systematics, but Biblical criteria for taxonomy take precedence over all other criteria. This undermines their claim to objectivity: they accept evidence for the common ancestry of cats or dogs but not analogous evidence for the common ancestry of apes and humans.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have noted}} some peculiarities in the mummification process {{used on the}} Lady. The {{evisceration}} {{of the body and}} the stuffing of the torso with embalming materials were standard parts of the mummification process used during the entire reign of the 18th dynasty. This was not the case with the intact skull base and lack of effort to remove the brain, seen {{in the case of the}} Lady. This process had been used on early rulers of the 18th dynasty, as seen in the mummies currently identified with Thutmose I, Thutmose II, and Thutmose III. By the time of the later rulers of the 18th dynasty, when the Lady lived and died, the process had changed. All mummies from this later era contain some treatment of the brain, in attempts to remove it from the body. The mummification process used on the Lady seems like a throwback to an earlier era. Another peculiarity <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> that the people behind the mummification process were trying to repair and cover injured areas of the body. They used subcutaneous fillings and packs to remodel the injured left side of the face, the contralateral side of the face, and the right hip region. This was not part of the regular efforts of an embalmer.|$|E

25|$|The {{uncertainty}} in COROT-7b mass {{does not allow}} precise modelling of the planet structure. Nevertheless, educated guesses could still be put forth. Assuming a 5-Earth-masses planet, the planet was modeled to have convection in the mantle with a small core {{with no more than}} 15% the mass of the planet, or 0.7 M⊕. The lower mantle above the core-mantle boundary has more sluggish convection than the upper mantle because the greater pressure causes fluids to become more viscous. The temperature of the upper convecting mantle is different {{from one side of the}} planet to the other with lateral temperature differences for downwellings up to several hundred kelvins. However, the temperature of the upwelling is unaffected by downwelling and surface temperature variations. On the permanent dayside of the tidally locked planet where the surface temperature is hot from continuously facing its sun, the surface takes part in convection, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> that all the surface of this hemisphere being covered in oceans of lava. On the permanent nightside, the surface is cool enough for the formation of the crust with pools of lava above the convective mantle with intense volcanism. The dayside of the planet has larger convection cells than the nightside. Researchers also investigated the physical state of the interior of CoRoT-7b, indicating as likely a solid iron core, thus a self-generated magnetic field should be absent on the planet.|$|E
500|$|Mouhot, {{like other}} early Western visitors, found it {{difficult}} to believe that the Khmers could have built the temple and mistakenly dated it to around the same era as Rome. The true history of Angkor Wat was pieced together only from stylistic and epigraphic evidence accumulated during the subsequent clearing and restoration work carried out across the whole Angkor site.

Faith is the substance, the assurance of things hoped for, because it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> of things not seen." [...] Malcolm Warner, curator of the Yale Center for British Art, interpreted the work differently, writing in 1996 that [...] "the quiet sound of the lyre's single string is all that is left of the full music of religious faith; those who still listen are blindfolded in the sense that, even if real reasons for Hope exist, they cannot see them; Hope remains a virtue, but in the age of scientific materialism a weak and ambiguous one".|$|E

2500|$|So strong <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> for {{forward defence}} under Diocletian that Luttwak himself struggles {{to avoid that}} conclusion. At one point, he {{describes}} it as [...] "shallow defence-in-depth", a contradiction in terms. At another, he admits that Diocletian's policy was a [...] "sustained attempt to provide a preclusive (i.e. forward) defence of the imperial territory". Indeed, the unfavourable evidence forces Luttwak to adopt a self-contradicting thesis. While claiming that the basic strategy of the fourth century was defence-in-depth, he admits that there were repeated attempts by the stronger emperors (up to and including Valentinian I) to revert to forward defence. This obviously casts doubt on whether a defence-in-depth strategy was ever contemplated or implemented in reality.|$|E
2500|$|After {{four months}} of disassembly, work began on a new {{construction}} of the helmet. This work was advanced largely by the discovery of new joins, marked by several breakthroughs in understanding. [...] "Almost all" [...] of the new joins were found {{by looking at the}} backs of the fragments, which retained [...] "a unique blackened, rippled and bubbly nature," [...] "wrinkled like screwed up paper and very black in colour." [...] The distinctive nature is thought to result from a [...] "disintegrated leather lining permeated with iron oxide"—indeed, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> substantiating the leather lining in the Royal Armouries replica—and allowed for the fragments' wrinkles to be matched under a microscope. In this manner the skull cap was built out from the crest, aided by the discovery that only the two fluted strips bordering the crest were gilded; the six fragments with gilded moulding were consequently found to attach to the crest. The cheek guards, meanwhile, were shaped and substantially lengthened by joining three fragments from the sinister side of the first reconstruction with two fragments from the dexter side. The exposed areas by the jaw left by the first reconstruction were only eliminated {{near the end of the}} second, when an expert on arms and armour advised that the cheek guards should simply switch sides.|$|E
