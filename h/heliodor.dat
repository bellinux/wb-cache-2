25|$|General <b>Heliodor</b> Píka (3 July 1897 – 21 June 1949) was a Czechoslovak {{army officer}} who was {{executed}} by his country's Communist regime after a show trial.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heliodor</b> Píka {{was born}} in a village of Štítina in Austrian Silesia, near Opava, then Austria-Hungary. During World War I, Píka served as a Czechoslovak legionnaire in the Russian theatres. He was {{captured}} at Berestechko on 5 October 1916, during the Russian campaign but by 1917 he had returned to duty {{as a member of the}} French Army and would later serve with the Czechoslovak Legions in France. By 1920, when the Legion was disbanded, Píka had risen to the rank of lieutenant.|$|E
25|$|Bareḳet (בָּרֶקֶת = in the masoretic text) / Smaragdos (in the Septuagint) - Bareketh {{etymologically}} means ‘lightning flash’, whence shimmering or shiny. Smaragdos is cognate with Emerald, {{and literally}} means green stone, but is {{somewhat of a}} false friend as the Greek term could apply {{to a number of}} different green gems, not just the emerald in particular. Smaragdos was often used in Greek literature to refer to an intensely bright crystal found in columnar formations. Emerald in the proper sense of green beryl exists locally in Egypt. Items carved from emerald are known from as early as the 12th Dynasty, 1900s BCE, during the Bronze Age. But these emeralds are random finds, and not actively mined until the Ptolemaic period. Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, is famous for her love for the Egyptian emerald. Other minerals resembling emerald are <b>heliodor</b> (taking into account the implication of Smaragdos that it was green) and rock crystal (ignoring the literal meaning of Smaragdos, since the masoretic text doesn't appear to specify colour); there is much to be said for Smaragdos being either of those. Although “emerald” is the most common form used to describe the Hebrew word, bareḳet, in other sources (e.g. the Septuagint on Ezek. 28:13), the word bareḳet is rendered as “onyx.” Aquilas the proselyte (Onkelos), in his Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch, writes בָרקָן = barḳan, for this word. According to the Midrash Rabba (Numbers Rabba 2:7), the stone called bareḳet had veins or parallel bands of colours white, black and red running through it, suggesting that it may have actually been a kind of agate or onyx. This may explain why in some French translations the word is rendered as “agate.” In the South Arabian dialect spoken in Yemen during the Middle Ages, baḳarani (believed to be a corruption of barḳan) was an exceptionally beautiful and rare onyx stone mined on Mount Anis, in Yemen, one variety of which having a red surface with a vein of white over another of black running through it. Symmachus, an ancient Jewish translator whose Greek translation of the Pentateuch appeared in Origen's Hexapla, has also written κεραύνιος (=onyx) for the stone known in Hebrew as bareḳet in Exo. 28:17.|$|E
2500|$|Golden beryl {{can range}} in colors from pale yellow to a {{brilliant}} gold. Unlike emerald, golden beryl generally has very few flaws. The term [...] "golden beryl" [...] is sometimes synonymous with <b>heliodor</b> (from Greek hēlios – ἥλιος [...] "sun" [...] + dōron – δῶρον [...] "gift") but golden beryl refers to pure yellow or golden yellow shades, while <b>heliodor</b> {{refers to the}} greenish-yellow shades. The golden yellow color is attributed to Fe3+ ions. Both golden beryl and <b>heliodor</b> are used as gems. Probably the largest cut golden beryl is the flawless 2054-carat stone {{on display in the}} Hall of Gems, Washington, D.C., United States.|$|E
2500|$|In early May 1948, {{despite his}} status as a {{high-ranking}} military officer, <b>Heliodor</b> Píka was arrested without a warrant and accused of espionage and high treason. The Czechoslovak authorities forged a memorandum that purported to link General Píka to British military intelligence. (Historian Edward Crankshaw noted that the document, written in broken English, was [...] "the most appalling and most unimaginably inefficient bit of forgery [...] ever come across".) Despite the inadequacy of the memorandum, Píka was held through 1948 and interrogated by -trained officers of the OBZ.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Heliodor</b> Píka was hanged in {{the yard}} of Bory Prison (...) in Plzeň around 06:00 {{on the morning of}} June 21, 1949. In a {{farewell}} letter to his family, written the night before his execution, he wrote: [...] "I am sure {{that this is not a}} judicial error but a political murder". Offered the chance to express his last wishes as he stood at the gallows, he said: [...] "my ultimate desire is that the nation remain united, and that everyone, without regard for their differences, work toward the unity of our people". He was the first of more than 200 Czechoslovaks tried and executed for political reasons by the communist government of Czechoslovakia. His body was never found.|$|E
2500|$|Šoham (שֹׁהַם = in the masoretic text) / Beryllios (in the Septuagint) - in {{some other}} places the Septuagint instead has Onychion, or Smaragdos, or the phrase leek-green stone, where the masoretic reads Šoham; Beryllios refers to Beryl but earlier to the blue-green colour of the sea, Onychion refers to Onyx, and Smaragdos {{literally}} means green stone and refers to a bright columnar crystal (either beryl or rock crystal). Onyx is an opaque and banded stone, while Smaragdos is translucent, and Beryl is cloudy, and all these come in several colours. Šoham could be derived from the Assyrian word Samtu, meaning dark or cloudy; it could be derived from the Arabic word meaning pale, in which case it fits more with Onyx and certain forms of Beryl, excluding the Emerald, with <b>Heliodor</b> being the form of Beryl fitting the leek green description; it could be derived from the Arabic word musahham, meaning striped garment, and therefore very definitely describing something like Onyx; {{or it could be}} a place name, for example there is a place in the Yemen named Soheim. Jewish tradition generally favours leek-green Beryl (<b>Heliodor)</b> as the likely meaning of Šoham, though scholars think it {{is more likely to be}} Malachite, which can be green enough to be compared to Smaragdos and the blue-green colour of the sea (the original meaning of beryllios), is cloudy enough to be compared to a cloudy form of Beryl, and is striped and opaque enough to be confused for a form of Onyx. According to Epiphanius’ Treatise on the Twelve Stones (Epiphanius de Gemmis), the beryl was “white like a cloud.” Scholars point out that the Syriac form of the word is berūlā and/or belūra, the latter evidently going back to a Pahlevi form (the old Persian tongue), and all in turn to the Sanskrit वैडूर्य = vaiḍūrya (Pali: veḷuriyaṁ), the gemstone which is called in English, [...] "cat's eye, beryl," [...] a variety of chalcedonic quartz that has a chatoyant lustre resembling the eye of a cat when cut.|$|E
2500|$|Whether {{there is}} any pattern to the choice of gemstones depends on their identity. Taking the {{majority}} view of scholars {{in regard to the}} identity of the gems, and including the implication from the Book of Revelation that the Onyx {{at the end of the}} fourth row was a Sardonyx, there are four colours – red, green, yellow, and blue – each represented by a clear gem (red – Carbuncle, green – <b>Heliodor,</b> yellow – Chrysolite, blue – Amethyst), an opaque gem (red – Carnelian/red Jasper, green – green Jasper, yellow – yellow Jasper/yellow Serpentine, blue - Lapis Lazuli), and a striped gem (red – Sardonyx, green – Malachite, yellow – pale golden Agate, blue – sky-blue Agate). The four colours of red, green, yellow, and blue, are the first four colours (apart from black and white) distinguished by languages, and are distinguished in all cultures with at least six colour distinctions (the other two being black and white). These colours roughly correspond to the sensitivities of the retinal ganglion cells. (The retinal ganglia process colour by positioning it within a blue to yellow range, and separately positioning it within a red to green range.) ...|$|E
