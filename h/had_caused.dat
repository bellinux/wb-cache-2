5|$|Abraham Landis {{worked in}} Millville {{as a country}} physician. When Kenesaw was eight, the elder Landis moved his family to Delphi, Indiana and {{subsequently}} to Logansport, Indiana where the doctor purchased and ran several local farms—his war injury <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> him to scale back his medical practice. Two of Kenesaw's four brothers, Charles Beary Landis and Frederick Landis, became members of Congress.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of federal authorities, the men were placed on {{lockdown}} in their Obion County, Tennessee, jail cell for their own safety. The two men could leave their cell for only one hour to watch television or use the phone; authorities said they <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> no problems during {{their time in the}} jail.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial predictions, Edouard's {{effects were}} much less than expected. Strong waves struck much of the East Coast of the United States, killing 2 and {{injuring}} numerous others. In 2011 the National Hurricane Center reported that Edouard <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> a total of US$20million with the greatest damage occurring on Cape Cod, where moderate wind gusts resulted in $4.6million (2007USD).|$|E

5|$|Further {{issues were}} {{discovered}} upon {{the launch of}} the Anniversary Update ("Redstone"), including a bug that caused some devices to freeze (but addressed by cumulative update KB3176938, released on August 31, 2016), and that fundamental changes to how Windows handles webcams <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> many to stop working.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, she {{revealed}} {{her struggle}} with chronic iritis that <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> temporary blindness in one eye. Some months earlier she had surgery that had corrected the problem. Kunis also has heterochromia iridum, {{a condition in}} which the irises are different colors. One eye (left) is brown, and the other (right) is green.|$|E
5|$|Manning's lawyers {{argued that}} the {{government}} had overstated the harm the release of the documents <b>had</b> <b>caused,</b> and had overcharged Manning to force her to give evidence against Assange. The defense also raised questions about whether Manning's confusion over her gender identity affected her behavior and decision making.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} hypothesis, {{there was a}} 150 m3 slide off Nice airport while {{constructing}} the fill of a new airport, perhaps {{as a consequence of}} this work. This landslide would <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> the first tsunami. After that, the material of this slide would <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> the submarine slide that would <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> the second tsunami.|$|R
50|$|The mining {{activity}} <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> {{severe environmental impact}} in Brazil area. Among {{the different types of}} environmental degradation, mining activities <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> landscape degradation, erosion, soil contamination, groundwater and surface water pollution.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, major {{setbacks}} in Spain at Almanza {{and along}} the Rhine in Southern Germany, <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> Marlborough great anxiety. Prince Eugene's retreat from Toulon (Marlborough's major goal for 1707) ended any lingering hopes of a war-winning blow that year.|$|E
5|$|On October 4, 1955, the CAB {{released}} the final accident report, which concluded {{the reversal of}} the propellers and subsequent increase in power of the No. 4 engine <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> the accident.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} explosion, Thompson was {{informed}} by an Iowa crewman that the Navy was conducting a dishonest {{investigation into the}} cause of the tragedy. Thompson, a producer for the television newsmagazine 60 Minutes, later produced several television reports which disputed the Navy's conclusions as to what <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> the explosion.|$|E

60|$|The {{question}} how far human volitions {{are subject to}} causal laws is a purely empirical one. Empirically it seems plain that {{the great majority of}} our volitions <b>have</b> <b>causes,</b> but it cannot, on this account, be held necessarily certain that all <b>have</b> <b>causes.</b> There are, however, precisely the same kinds of reasons for regarding it as probable that they all <b>have</b> <b>causes</b> as there are in the case of physical events.|$|R
5|$|The growing {{popularity}} of the sport <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> several environmental concerns, including soil erosion and trampled vegetation as climbers hike off-trail to reach bouldering sites. This <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> some landowners to restrict access or prohibit bouldering altogether.|$|R
5|$|The first {{investigation}} into the explosion, conducted by the U.S. Navy, concluded {{that one of the}} gun turret crew members, Clayton Hartwig, who died in the explosion, had deliberately caused it. During the investigation, numerous leaks to the media, later attributed to U.S. Navy officers and investigators, implied that Hartwig and another sailor, Kendall Truitt, had engaged in a homosexual relationship and that Hartwig <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> the explosion after their relationship had soured. In its report, however, the U.S. Navy concluded that the evidence did not show that Hartwig was homosexual but that he was suicidal and <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> the explosion with either an electronic or chemical detonator.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} T.truncata were once used {{extensively}} for decoration. Geoffrey Smith observed in 1909 that {{the collection of}} the flowers for this purpose <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> the decline of some populations on Mount Wellington. The timber of larger specimens has been used for inlays; it has an attractive grain and a pale red color.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{world was}} a much less urban society than either the Roman Empire or the modern world. The fall of the Roman Empire <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> a catastrophic de-population of the towns and cities that had existed within the Empire. Between the 10th and 12th centuries, however, {{a revival of the}} European city occurred, with an {{increase}} in the urbanisation of society.|$|E
50|$|The Northern Rivers {{region is}} a {{competitive}} area for sports including soccer, rugby league and rugby union. This <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> a continual struggle for strong numbers {{at all the}} clubs and therefore <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> several teams to fold over its history.|$|R
50|$|Sheep {{and cattle}} have been {{introduced}} on Tristan da Cunha and their grazing, along with other human activity <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> damage to the island's ecosystems. Night fishing <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> the deaths of many seabirds as they crash into ships' lights.|$|R
50|$|Drainage from crop fields <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> nitrate {{to leach}} into groundwater, which has {{adversely}} affected some drinking water {{sources in the}} Mississippi River Basin. In surface waters, high nitrate levels have led to instances of eutrophication, which <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> dissolved oxygen levels to significantly decrease in affected water bodies including the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Furthermore, altered nitrate to silicate ratios <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> coastal marine ecosystems {{to move away from}} a diatom based system to a less productive system.|$|R
5|$|The {{subsequent}} court-martial at Port Royal on 3 September {{ruled that}} a sudden change in the current after dark <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> the loss. The board acknowledged that Pamplin had sailed in a judicious manner and exonerated him and his officers from blame both {{for the loss of}} Lowestoffe and the vessels in convoy.|$|E
5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{planned for}} the fourth series, it {{would have seen the}} return of UNIT, as they, along with Sarah Jane, {{investigated}} a mysterious cold effecting residents of Bannerman Road.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a single-engine aircraft type with a closed cockpit would improve his condition. His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount of suspicion is reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E

50|$|Aluminum {{adjuvants}} <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> {{motor neuron}} death in mice when injected {{directly onto the}} spine at the scruff of the neck, and oil-water suspensions {{have been reported to}} increase the risk of autoimmune disease in mice. Squalene <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> rheumatoid arthritis in rats already prone to arthritis.|$|R
5|$|Among the Romani people, mullo (literally {{one who is}} dead) are {{believed}} to return from the dead and cause malicious acts as well as drink human blood, most often that of a relative or the person who <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> their death. Other potential victims were {{those who did not}} properly observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased's possessions instead of properly destroying them. Female vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with their sexual appetite. Similar to other European beliefs, male vampires could father children, known as dhampirs, who could be hired to detect and get rid of vampires.|$|E
5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
5|$|Danilo Romanovich laid siege to Halych, and Andrew's {{youngest}} son {{died during the}} siege {{in the autumn of}} 1234. However, Andrew stormed Austria in the summer of 1235, forcing Duke Frederick to pay an indemnification for damages that his troops <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> while raiding Hungary. Upon Andrew's demand, Pope Gregory declared on 31 August that Andrew and his sons could only be excommunicated by the authorization of the Holy See. Andrew died on 21 September, and was buried in Egres Abbey.|$|E
50|$|Journalism analysts {{argue that}} the media <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> {{widespread}} compassion fatigue in society by saturating newspapers and news shows with often decontextualized images and stories of tragedy and suffering. This <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> the public to become cynical, or become resistant to helping people who are suffering.|$|R
