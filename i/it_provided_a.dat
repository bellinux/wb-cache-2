5|$|A {{variation}} on this theme were oil-lamp clocks. These early timekeeping devices {{consisted of a}} graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> rough measure of the passage of time.|$|E
5|$|Lamu Fort {{was built}} between 1813 and 1821 with Omani assistance. Initially <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> {{base from which}} the Omanis {{consolidated}} their control of the East African coast but the town later lost its economic importance. During the British colonial period, and after the independence of Kenya, the fort {{was used as a}} prison. Today it houses an environmental museum and library, and is often used for community events.|$|E

5|$|On 13 September 1972 {{the unit}} was {{activated}} at Fort Lewis, Washington. The 89th Military Police Group {{was designed to}} command and control the operations of three to five military police battalions and other assigned or attached units. Additionally, <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> Provost Marshal staff section to the corps headquarters while assigned as their senior military police organization.|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} slavery in ancient Greece is beset by significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing primarily on the city-state of Athens. No treatises are specifically devoted to the subject, and jurisprudence was interested in slavery only inasmuch as <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> source of revenue. Greek comedies and tragedies represented stereotypes, while iconography made no substantial differentiation between slaves and craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|The line {{ran from}} Yatton to Wells. When {{the rest of}} the line was closed and all {{passenger}} services ceased, the section of the line between Cheddar and Yatton remained open for goods traffic. <b>It</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> fast link with the main markets for the strawberries in Birmingham and London, but finally closed in 1964, becoming part of the Cheddar Valley Railway Nature Reserve.|$|E

5|$|Wooller {{founded the}} Jeff Wooller College {{which was based}} in London. <b>It</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> wide range of courses {{including}} ACCA, CIMA, CAT and AIA courses. In 1995, Wooller denied involvement in a visa scam with the Jeff Wooller College. In the 1990s, Wooller sold the business to Felix Orogun and in 2008, it was renamed to Holborn School of Finance and Management following bad publicity about Wooller.|$|E
5|$|Braille {{studied in}} Coupvray {{until the age}} of ten. Because of his {{combination}} of intelligence and diligence, Braille was permitted to attend one of the first schools for blind children in the world, the Royal Institute for Blind Youth, since renamed to the National Institute for Blind Youth in Paris. Braille, the last of the family's children to leave the household, departed for the school in February 1819. At that time the Royal Institute was an underfunded, ramshackle affair, but <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> relatively stable environment for blind children to learn and associate together.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, however, Sinclair Radionics was {{experiencing}} serious difficulties. It lost {{its ability to}} compete effectively in the calculator market following the launch {{of a new generation}} of Japanese-produced calculators with liquid crystal displays, which were much more capable and power-efficient than Sinclair's LED calculators. Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch turned out to be expensive failures. The company made losses of more than £350,000 in 1975–76, bringing it to the edge of bankruptcy. In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), which recapitalised <b>it,</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73% stake.|$|E

In a 1.6× body, such as the Canon EOS 7D, <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> narrower field of view, equivalent to an 80 mm lens mounted on a 35 mm frame body. With a 1.5× body such as the Nikon D300, <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> less narrow field of view, equivalent to a 75 mm lens mounted on a 35 mm frame body. With a 1.3× body such as the Canon EOS-1D Mark III, <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> even less narrow field of view, equivalent to a 65 mm lens mounted on a 35 mm frame body.|$|R
5|$|Conquering {{the peoples}} of the Alps in 16BC was another {{important}} victory for Rome, since <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> large territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Rome's enemies in Germania to the north. Horace dedicated an ode to the victory, while the monument Trophy of Augustus near Monaco was built to honor the occasion. The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12BC, when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum, and his brother Nero Claudius Drusus moved against the Germanic tribes of the eastern Rhineland. Both campaigns were successful, as Drusus' forces reached the Elbe River by 9BC—though he died shortly after by falling off his horse. It was recorded that the pious Tiberius walked in front of his brother's body {{all the way back to}} Rome.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} of Troll, which opened in 1990, {{it was decided that}} the station was to be placed at such a location as to allow it to have an airstrip for year-round operations. Jutulsessen was chosen as the location, in part because <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> base nunatak for the research station {{and at the same time}} was close to blue ice for the runway. At the time, all cargo and passengers to Troll had to either be transported by ship, or flown in via the airport at the Russian base Novolazarevskaya or Henriksenskjera.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{superstring}} revolution in 1984, many physicists turned to string theory {{as a unified}} theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects. Another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian. In string theory, the possibilities are much more constrained: by the 1990s, physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.|$|E

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1968–1969, Jens Juncker-Jensen went even further with an {{excellent}} exhibition Fotografiet som udtryksmiddel (Photography {{as a means of}} expression) for which he drew the very best material from the few photographic books of the time, attracting not only professional and amateur photographers but also architects and television producers. <b>It</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> basis for six TV programmes over the following months. There was, however, little real discussion of photography as an art form.|$|E
5|$|John Jackson, Patrick Martin and Harriet Hughes, {{all members}} of the Countryside Alliance, sought {{judicial}} review of the use of the Parliament Acts to pass the Hunting Act. They claimed that the 1949 Act had not been lawfully passed either because the 1911 Act could not be used to amend itself or because <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> method of making delegated or subordinate legislation which could not alter the process of legislating. Consequently, they claimed, the 1949 Act had not reduced the delay specified in the 1911 Act and the Hunting Act, which was passed only in accordance with the requirements as amended by the 1949 Act, was invalid.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft, in 2000, {{released}} {{new products}} {{for all three}} lines of the company's flagship operating system, and saw {{the beginning of the}} end of one of its most prominent legal cases.

5|$|On 7 November, Turgut Reis shelled Bulgarian troops around Tekirdağ. On 17 November, she {{supported}} the Ottoman III Corps by bombarding the attacking Bulgarian forces. The ship was aided by artillery observers ashore. The battleship's gunnery was largely ineffective, though <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> morale boost for the besieged Ottoman army dug in at Çatalca. By 17:00, the Bulgarian infantry had largely been forced {{back to their}} starting positions, {{in part due to}} the psychological effect of the battleships' bombardment. On 22 November, Turgut Reis sortied from the Bosporus to cover the withdrawal of Hamidiye, which had been torpedoed by a Bulgarian torpedo boat earlier that morning.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} influences on History of a Six Weeks' Tour was Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), written by Mary Shelley's mother Mary Wollstonecraft. A travel narrative that reflects on topography, politics, society, aesthetics, and the author's personal feelings, <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> model for Mary Shelley's work. Like her mother, Mary Shelley revealed her liberalism by boldly discussing politics; however, this political tone was unusual for travel works at the time and was considered inappropriate for women writers. Like Wollstonecraft's Letters, History of a Six Weeks' Tour blurs the line between private and public spheres by using intimate genres such as the journal and the letter, allowing Mary Shelley to present political opinions through personal anecdote and the picturesque.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} {{completed}} in 1928 by the NSW Department of Public Works and, although opened as a traffic bridge, {{it was designed to}} carry the loads required for a railway, once the Mildura railway line had been extended over the bridge. The line was never extended beyond Yelta, where the terminus remains to this day. The location of the bridge was thought to be convenient, as <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> link to the Sturt Highway without travelling farther upstream to Mildura. It is the only remaining steel truss bridge with a lift span on the Murray, although other lifting bridges still exist along the river. The bridge was built after the decline in commercial river traffic on the Murray. Due to its significance to the local area, it has been listed on the NSW State Heritage Register.|$|E
