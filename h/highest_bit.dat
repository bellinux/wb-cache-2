It can either have no influence on the background color making text blink when set, effectively limiting the available background colors to only eight, or if intensive background colors are enabled the full 16 colors become available but blinking is no longer available. This behavior can be changed, i.e., using BIOS 80x86 interrupt 0x10, function 0x1003. This 16 colour palette is often used in console programs (e.g. cmd in Windows) and sometimes for chat in games (e.g. Minecraft).|$|E

30|$|To {{sum up the}} results, FDASH {{maintains}} the appropriate bit rate and shows a low number of bit rate changes. However, it requests a low bit rate segment until the client buffer reaches the target buffer level, so clients {{have to wait a}} long time to watch high-quality video. SARA reaches a <b>high</b> <b>bit</b> rate faster than other methods. However, it consumes client buffers quickly by requiring segments with an excessively <b>high</b> <b>bit</b> rate. The proposed scheme reaches a <b>high</b> <b>bit</b> rate faster than FDASH, and it {{maintains the}} bit rate longer than SARA after reaching the bit rate. In addition, it usually shows a small quality variation.|$|R

Even more importantly, forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the <b>highest</b> <b>bit</b> set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged.|$|E

In practice, results are currently variable, and depend {{on the quality of}} the input signal and amount of processing power applied to the conversion.

In this paper, we propose a Coding Block (CB) -level JND-based luma and chroma perceptual quantisation technique for HEVC named Pixel-PAQ.

When applied to YCbCr 4 : 4 : 4 <b>high</b> <b>bit</b> depth video data, Pixel-PAQ can achieve vast bitrate reductions — of up to 75 % (68. 6 % over four QP data points) — compared with a state-of-the-art luma-based JND method for HEVC named IDSQ.
