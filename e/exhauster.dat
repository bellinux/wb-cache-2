25|$|This {{corner is}} also the former site of the country's longest-serving gasworks, which {{operated}} from 1863 to 1987, and a small industrial museum, the Dunedin Gasworks Museum, {{is located on the}} southern part of its site on Braemar Street. Opened to the public in 2001, this museum is one of only three known preserved gasworks museums in the world. The museum features five steam pumping engines which were used in the gasworks, and an older engine imported from Scotland in 1868. Three of the buildings within the Gasworks complex have NZHPT classifications: the skeleton of the 1879 gasometer, the <b>exhauster</b> and boiler house, and the fitting shop (all Category I).|$|E
25|$|Prejudice against {{hydraulic}} transmission {{in the higher}} echelons of BR's engineering divisions decreed in 1967 that all the WR's diesel-hydraulics were non-standard and should be withdrawn as soon as possible. Added to this were practical problems modernising the D800s: because of the scaled-down bodyshell {{there was very little}} room inside for extra equipment. It was, for example, physically impossible to accommodate a compressor as well as an <b>exhauster,</b> so the locomotives were unable to haul newer designs of air-braked coaching stock. It also proved impractical to equip them with electric train heating (ETH) equipment, for similar reasons, so they retained unreliable steam heat boilers to the end of their lives. It was intended to equip no. D870 with ETH; to provide the necessary additional power, the engines would have been uprated by the fitment of charge-air coolers. No work was actually carried out, other than the fitment of appropriate jumper cables on the locomotive ends.|$|E

50|$|The steam ejector/aspirator type <b>exhauster</b> used a {{substantial}} steam jet/venturi {{to maintain the}} negative pressure in the hydraulic main and condenser. This type of <b>exhauster</b> was mechanically simple, had no moving parts, and thus, had virtually no potential to fail. However, it consumed a comparatively large amount of steam. Often used as a backup exhauster; in this role it continued as a reliable backup {{until the end of}} the age of manufactured gas.|$|E

50|$|The {{buildings}} {{date back}} to the original coal-gas facility (ca 1910) and were constructed of wood. The pump house (also known as the <b>exhauster</b> house) is about 7340 ft2 m2 and the boiler house is about 5720 ft2 m2. The wood frames of both buildings remain intact and in place on concrete slab foundations.|$|E
50|$|Adjoining the {{condenser}} {{building on}} the north was the <b>exhauster</b> building, or pump that force gas through the system into the holders. A 12 horsepower engine was used to drive the pumps or the exhausters powering this system. Off the north-side of this building was another small building housing a 75 horsepower steam boiler, both of these buildings were one story.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Development of a model-software complex (MSC) for {{computer}} analysis of modes {{of the system}} of induction motors (IM) of smoke <b>exhausters</b> of thermal power plant (TPP), the basic elements of which are mathematical models and corresponding software written in the programming language FORTRAN. Methodology. Mathematical model serves as a system of differential equations of electrical and mechanical condition. The equation of electric state is written in phase coordinates based on Kirchhoff's laws, and mechanical condition described by the d'Alembert equation. Mathematical model focuses on explicit numerical integration methods. Scientific novelty. The equation of state of electrical connections takes into account the mutual electromagnetic circuits for transformer of own needs (TON) and induction motors and interdependence (in all possible combinations) between: TON (from which motors powered) and each of the two IM and blood pressure between themselves. The complex allows to simulate electromagnetic and electromechanical processes in transitional and steady, symmetric and asymmetric modes including modes of self-induction motors. Results. Complex is used {{for computer}} analysis of electromagnetic and electromechanical processes and established the basic laws of motion modes of starting, stopping and self-start of IM of smoke <b>exhausters</b> of the TPP unit. Practical value. The complex is suitable for computer analysis of modes of other similar units of own needs of thermal power plants...|$|R
50|$|This is {{the final}} design for the compressor/exhauster sets from the late 1950s. They {{are made up of}} an in-line {{arrangement}} (from left to right) of an 8,000 horsepower steam turbine, then two low-pressure compressors, a high-pressure <b>exhauster,</b> a 27MW 11kV synchronous motor that provided 36,000 horsepower, and finally the barring gear and the exciter (a small generator that provides a current needed to start the main motor).|$|E

But {{they could not have}} anticipated the phenomenal force required by Cell 4 - even with all eight exhausters running the suction was insufficient. The solution was to build another <b>exhauster</b> set directly next to Cell 4. As there are eight in the Air House, this one was named number 9.|$|E

50|$|The WAM1 {{locomotives}} were {{supplied by}} Mitsubishi in 1964-66 (four in 1964, 14 in 1965 {{and two in}} 1966). They were jointly built by Mitsubishi, Toshiba and Hitachi, as shown by their builders' plates. They are of the B-B configuration, with two monomotor bogies, each with one bogie-mounted DC traction motor; the two traction motors were permanently coupled in parallel. They had an Oerlikon compressor and <b>exhauster</b> for the locomotive's air brakes and the train's vacuum brakes, and Arno rotatory converters. They were equipped with two Faively AM-12 pantographs.|$|E
50|$|The Bema Street tunnel was {{restored}} to street traffic after the war. In a further controversy, the alleged gas <b>exhauster</b> machinery and mysterious massive ventilators {{that might have}} been used to remove the gas into the atmosphere following the gassings were removed and scrapped during renovation works in 1996 and the early 2000s. In recent years, the part of the tunnel was turned into an unofficial mausoleum site by citizens of Warsaw. In 2001 the Polish parliament Sejm appealed for construction of an official memorial at the tunnel.|$|E
50|$|The {{power unit}} on launch was a Leyland O350H 97 bhp 5.76-litre {{four-stroke}} direct-injection six-cylinder diesel, mounted horizontally in mid-wheelbase driving through a unit-mounted Albion clutch and constant mesh gearbox to an overhead-worm rear axle derived from that fitted to the FT and PF series lorries. The radiator was mounted {{behind the front}} axle and was inclined to allow a larger surface area without intrusion into the saloon. Braking was vacuum-assisted hydraulic with an engine-driven vacuum <b>exhauster.</b> The fuel tank was a 35 gallon cylindrical unit transversely mounted between the frame members aft of the rear axle. The engine was fitted with an oil-bath air cleaner and a centrifugal oil filter.|$|E
50|$|When {{built in}} 1956, the {{building}} was primarily built around a single Carbureted Water Gas Plant with plans for a later second. The plant itself dominated the first 3 levels of the building with its massive steel furnace and generator blocks (steel structures lined with firebrick on the interior). The first floor (ground level) housed many associated machinery items including both electric and steam powered <b>exhausters,</b> a wash box and tram cart. The upper most level {{was used as a}} coal store with gravity feeders connecting it to the plant.|$|R
50|$|The 'B' {{power station}} was {{installed}} with three 60 MW machines (equalling 180 MW total capacity). It used {{a central unit}} control system with the turbine/hydrogen cooled alternators manufactured by the General Electric Company (GEC). As with 'A' power station, no.3 alternator was a prototype direct water-cooled machine. The coolant water was fed via glass tubes on the three-phase connections. Each unit had boilers manufactured by John Thompson of Wolverhampton, each using two suction ball mills each with two <b>exhausters,</b> these feeding to twelve front wall pulverized fuel burners. The boilers fed steam at 900 psi/900 degrees Fahrenheit directly to each turbine/alternator.|$|R
50|$|N. Dobrokhotov {{proposed}} {{to increase the}} capacity of open-hearth furnaces to increase their productivity and reduce fuel consumption in steel smelting and later formulated the basic theses {{of the theory of}} intensification of heat work of open-hearth furnaces. With the use of the provisions made by him in the mid 1930s were upgraded 90-ton open-hearth furnaces of Nizhnedneprovsk metallurgical plant in the name of Comintern. Increased heat output of the furnaces made it possible to dramatically raise their productivity and exceed all previously known records of high-speed steelification. Later was improved design of open-hearth furnaces of many metallurgical plants. N. Dobrokhotov {{proposed to}} equip open-hearth furnaces with fans for air supply, with smoke <b>exhausters</b> for removal of combustion products, with front wall without arch and improved refrigerators.|$|R
