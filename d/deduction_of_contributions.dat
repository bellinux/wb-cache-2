30|$|European tax {{systems in}} general and income and payroll tax systems in {{particular}} are not age-specific, given that the income tax rate relates {{to the level of}} income and not the age of the taxpayer. While there is extensive empirical literature on the relationship between taxes and the individual labour supply decisions 6, there are few empirical findings of tax impacts on the labour supply decision of older workers. The age group that is in transition between employment and retirement is usually excluded from labour supply incentives. The labour income of workers includes decisions of qualification, income level of the industry, hours worked, age, gender, etc., with tax incentives corresponding to the elasticity of the mentioned components. Empirical findings show that working aged women are more responsive to taxes and wages than men. For US employees, Alpert and Powell (2012) find significant effects of payroll taxes on labour exit and pension entries of older workers (55 to 74 year old): the higher the tax burden of older men, the sooner they will quit employment for retirement. The authors suggest that a tax decrease for older workers by one percentage points would decrease labour market exits by 4 %. Age specific <b>deductions</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> in the social security systems try to reduce labour costs of older workers to promote their labour market attachment. In Finland, the employer pension contribution rate decreased by 1.2 percentages to 16.1 %, and vice versa increased the contribution rate for the older employee by 1.2 percentage points to 5.8 % of pensionable income.|$|R

Similarproposals to emulate the income tax by imposing a percentagelimit on the <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> charitable <b>contributions</b> have beenfloated {{from time to time}} for at least 35 years, but recently thesetrial balloons have attracted more attention on Capitol Hill thanever before. By itself, the issue is a narrow one, affecting only asmall fraction of estates; but I propose to show that it raises fundamentalissues about the nature and objectives of death taxationand that, on analysis, the proposal for a percentage limitationturns out to rest on a faulty foundation. This analysis also exposesparallel shortcomings in the rationale underlying several otherproposed changes, such as converting the deduction into a taxcredit or substituting a system of matching federal grants to charitableinstitutions...|$|R

The Possiblity of the freedom of will was allowed in the critique of theoretical reason, but the substance of freedom was not determined. So when the Pure Practical Reason determines the substance of freedom by its law. the freedom gets its contents,and real meaning.

40|$|Two {{benchmark}} Vertisols from Maharashtra, viz. Linga series (Typic Haplusterts in Nagpur district) and Pahur series (Sodic Haplusterts in Yavatmal district) of Maharashtra {{were chosen}} for the study. The fine clay fractions are dominated by smectite with small amounts of vermiculite. Reduced CECs of the fine clays were determined after the Greene-Kelly test. CEC and calculated surface charges are distributed in both the tetrahedral and octahedral layers of which the former (65 %) {{is higher than the}} latter (35 %). However, the proportion of octahedral CEC and charge increases (44 %) with the <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> vermiculite and chlorite CEC from the tetrahedral (corrected) CEC. The The CEC and charge distribution exhibited fairly good relationship with some soil properties such as, fine clay, COLE, moisture retention at 1500 kPa, hydraulic conductivity and pH. The study also indicated that determination of reduced CECs from Greene-Kelley test is an effective means of measuring the octahedral and tetrahedral CECs and also for calculating the charge of soil clays. The Pahur soils could be more prone to hydroxy-interlayering owing to its higher tetrahedral charge than Linga soils. The surface area method overestimates the calculation of charge from CEC than formula weight method. In India, the black soils occupy about 116 m ha (Bhattacharyya et al., 2009) of which about 30 m ha is in Maharashtra and about 8. 04 m ha is in Vidarbha region. These soils are developed in alluvium derived from weathering of Deccan basalt (Pal et al., 2006). The black soils of the Deccan Trap are rich in plagioclase feldspars and yield dioctahedral smectite as its first weathering product (Pal and Deshpande, 1987; Pal et al., 1989; Bhattacharyya et al., 1993). Earlier review on the Vertisols of India indicate that black soils of India are dominated by beidellite-nontronite type of minerals (Ghosh and Kapoor, 1982). However, fine clay smectite when subjected to the Greene-Kelly test (Greene-Kelly, 1953) by heating clays with Li and subjecting to glycerolsolvation, expands to about 18 Å and contracts to ˜ 9. 5 Å indicating this to be a mixture of beidellite/nontronite and montmorillonite in which the amount of the former is more than the latter (Pal and Deshpande 1987; Ray et al., 2003...|$|R
