The JNA outpost occupied high ground overlooking the surrounding area, including Zadar. It housed radar equipment and was used as an artillery observer post. The JNA attempted to relieve the besieged garrison <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> however the attempts failed and the base surrendered to the HV on 22 May.

5|$|During the withdraw, however, A Company {{ran into}} a sizable North Korean force and had {{scattered}} in the ensuing fight. Most of the company, including its commander were killed at close range. In this desperate action, Private First Class Luther H. Story, a weapons squad leader, fought so tenaciously that {{he was awarded the}} Medal of Honor. Badly wounded, Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape, and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at close range. Of those in the company, approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines. The next morning, under heavy fog, the group made its way by compass toward Yongsan. From a hill at 12:00, after the fog had lifted, the men looked down on the Battle of Yongsan which was then in progress. That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near Yongsan. Stragglers from this position continued to stream <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|On 29November, {{the crew}} {{assembled}} {{to consider the}} proposal {{that some of the}} slaves should be thrown overboard. James Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first but it was soon unanimously agreed. On 29November, 54women and children were thrown through cabin windows into the sea. On 1December, 42male slaves were thrown overboard, and 36more followed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> Another ten, in a display of defiance at the inhumanity of the slavers, jumped into the sea. Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they were thrown into the water, one slave requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather than be thrown into the sea. The crew ignored this request. In total, 132 Africans were killed by the time the ship reached the Caribbean. The account of the King's Bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposing}} sides began {{bringing in}} reinforcements to the Kupres Plateau on 5 March to strengthen positions held around individual settlements populated by different ethnic groups, communications between those positions, and roads leading {{away from the}} plateau {{to the north and}} south. Different parts of the town of Kupres were controlled by the opposing forces, while the adjacent territory surrounding the town was controlled by the Bosnian Croat TO. In turn, that territory was surrounded by Bosnian Serb TO-held territory. By the end of the month, the bulk of the civilians living in the area were evacuated. On 2 April, negotiations to defuse the situation failed while the reinforcements continued to arrive. The battle commenced the next day. In Kupres itself, the Bosnian Croat TO achieved minor territorial gains on 4–5 April, before the JNA managed to advance to the outskirts of the town the next day. The JNA entered Kupres in the afternoon of 7 April and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> it successfully drove the Croatian forces from the plateau. The breakthrough came about after the infantry originally deployed to the battle was reinforced by an armoured battalion deployed from Knin.|$|E
