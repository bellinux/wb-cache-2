500|$|The western jackdaw (Coloeus monedula), {{also known}} as the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>jackdaw,</b> European jackdaw, or simply jackdaw, is a {{passerine}} bird in the crow family. Found across Europe, western Asia and North Africa, it is mostly resident, although northern and eastern populations migrate south in winter. Four subspecies are recognised, which mainly differ in the colouration of the plumage on the head and nape. Linnaeus first described it formally, giving it the name Corvus monedula. The common name derives from the word [...] "jack", meaning [...] "small", and [...] "daw", the native English name for the bird.|$|E

40|$|Corvids in Zhytomyr city reach maximum {{density in}} the winter period. Rooks and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Jackdaws</b> were the most {{abundant}} species in winter, usually feeding in multispecies flocks and forming collective roosts. Suburban green areas (buffer zones) were characterized by a considerably high diversity of Corvidae species: this habitat was occupied by all six species. We also registered the highest density of Eurasian Jays and Hooded Crows in this habitat. The green areas in the city center were also characterized by significant corvid density, especially during the breeding season. The maximum breeding density of Rooks was in these habitats, which held 6 of 12 identified urban colonies in Zhytomyr. We found that the European Magpies, Eurasian Jays, and Hooded Crows also had high breeding success here. <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Jackdaws</b> occurred here only in autumn and winter, when they fed together with Rooks on lawns, gardens, and parks. With stable snow cover the Rook density in habitats of the green areas decreased due to the depletion of food resources. The individual buildings zone of the city were characterized by the lowest density of all corvid species, except for European Magpies and Eurasian Jays. The number of common species (Rooks, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Jackdaws,</b> and Hooded Crows) was low because of shortage of food resources, lack of sites for large roosting flocks and shortage of suitable nesting sites. However, Eurasian Magpies reached one of their highest densities in this habitat (12. 8  birds/km 2). This species was registered in habitats around private buildings all the year round, successfully nesting in the yards of private houses and on trees in the streets. Its breeding density was 11. 2 birds/km 2. During three years of research (2009 – 2012) the density of all corvids except for European Magpie, practically did not change, although we determined a slight positive trend for all the species. The strong {{increase in the number}} of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Jackdaws</b> could be explained by the increasing density of wintering populations or due to the increasing number of migrants from more northern regions...|$|R
5|$|Predators of the {{tawny owl}} include large birds such as Ural owls, eagle owls, {{northern}} goshawks, golden eagles, and common buzzards. Pine martens may raid nests, especially where artificial nest boxes make the owls easy to find, and several instances {{have been recorded}} of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>jackdaws</b> building nests {{on top of a}} brooding female tawny owl leading to the death of the adult and chicks. A Danish study showed that predation by mammals, especially red foxes, was an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young, with 36% dying between fledging and independence. The mortality risk increased with fledging date from 14% in April to more than 58% in June, and increasing predation of late broods may be an important selective agent for early breeding in this species.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a novel approach}} to studying animal behaviour and {{the context in which}} it occurs, through the use of microphone backpacks carried on the backs of individual free-flying birds. These sensors are increasingly used by animal behaviour researchers to study individual vocalisations of freely behaving animals, even in the field. However such devices may record more than an animals vocal behaviour, and have the potential to be used for investigating specific activities (movement) and context (background) within which vocalisations occur. To facilitate this approach, we investigate the automatic annotation of such recordings through two different sound scene analysis paradigms: a scene-classification method using feature learning, and an event-detection method using probabilistic latent component analysis (PLCA). We analyse recordings made with <b>Eurasian</b> <b>jackdaws</b> (Corvus monedula) in both captive and field settings. Results are comparable with {{the state of the art}} in sound scene analysis; we find that the current recognition quality level enables scalable automatic annotation of audio logger data, given partial annotation, but also find that individual differences between animals and/or their backpacks limit the generalisation from one individual to another. we consider the interrelation of 'scenes' and 'events' in this particular task, and issues of temporal resolution...|$|R

50|$|It {{is about}} the same size as or {{slightly}} smaller (32 cm in length) than the western jackdaw, with the same proportions and identical habits. The principal difference lies in the plumage; many but not all adults have large areas of creamy white on the lower parts extending up around the neck as a broad collar. The head, throat, wings, and tail are glossy black and the ear coverts are grizzled grey. Darker adults and young birds resemble western jackdaws, though Daurian jackdaws have black irises, unlike the distinctive grey-white irises of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>jackdaw.</b> The only other pied corvid species inhabiting the same region is the Chinese collared crow (Corvus torquatus) but as this is a much larger bird (about the same size or slightly larger than the carrion crow) confusion is unlikely to occur.|$|E
40|$|Polyomaviruses {{are small}} nonenveloped {{particles}} with a circular double-stranded genome, approximately 5 kbp in size. The mammalian polyomaviruses mainly cause persistent subclinical infections {{in their natural}} nonimmunocompromised hosts. In contrast, the polyomaviruses of birds—avian polyomavirus (APV) and goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV) —are the primary agents of acute and chronic disease with high mortality rates in young birds. Screening of field samples of diseased birds by consensus PCR revealed the presence of two novel polyomaviruses in the liver of an Eurasian bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula griseiventris) and in the spleen of a <b>Eurasian</b> <b>jackdaw</b> (Corvus monedula), tentatively designated as finch polyomavirus (FPyV) and crow polyomavirus (CPyV), respectively. The genomes of the viruses were amplified by using multiply primed rolling-circle amplification and cloned. Analysis of the FPyV and CPyV genome sequences revealed a close relationship to APV and GHPV, indicating {{the existence of a}} distinct avian group among the polyomaviruses. The main characteristics of this group are (i) involvement in fatal disease, (ii) the existence of an additional open reading frame in the 5 ′ region of the late mRNAs, and (iii) a different manner of DNA binding of the large tumor antigen compared to that of the mammalian polyomaviruses...|$|E
50|$|The {{white stork}} breeds in open {{farmland}} areas {{with access to}} marshy wetlands, building a large stick nest in trees, on buildings, or on purpose-built man-made platforms. Each nest is 1 - 2 m in depth, 0.8 - 1.5 m in diameter, and 60 - 250 kg in weight. Nests are built in loose colonies. Not persecuted as it {{is viewed as a}} good omen, it often nests close to human habitation; in southern Europe, nests can be seen on churches and other buildings. The nest is typically used year after year especially by older males. The males arrive earlier in the season and choose the nests. Larger nests are associated with greater numbers of young successfully fledged, and appear to be sought after. Nest change is often related to a change in the pairing and failure to raise young the previous year, and younger birds are more likely to change nesting sites. Although a pair may be found to occupy a nest, partners may change several times during the early stages and breeding activities begin only after a stable pairing is achieved.Several bird species often nest within the large nests of the white stork. Regular occupants are house sparrows, tree sparrows, and common starlings; less common residents include Eurasian kestrels, little owls, European rollers, white wagtails, black redstarts, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>jackdaws,</b> and Spanish sparrows. Paired birds greet by engaging in up-down and head-shaking crouch displays, and clattering the beak while throwing back the head. Pairs copulate frequently throughout the month before eggs are laid. High-frequency pair copulation is usually associated with sperm competition and high frequency of extra-pair copulation; however, extra-pair copulation is infrequent in white storks.|$|R
5000|$|Ranging in {{size from}} the {{relatively}} small pigeon-sized <b>jackdaws</b> (<b>Eurasian</b> and Daurian) to the common raven of the Holarctic region and thick-billed raven of the highlands of Ethiopia, the 45 or so members of this genus occur on all temperate continents except South America, and several islands. The crow genus makes up {{a third of the}} species in the family Corvidae. The members appear to have evolved in Asia from the corvid stock, which had evolved in Australia. The collective name for a group of crows is a 'flock' or a 'murder'. The genus name is Latin for [...] "raven".|$|R
40|$|The article {{contains}} {{the results of}} observations on the formation, existence and the dissociation of the collective winter roost of corvids (crow species) in 2014 – 2015 in Melitopol (Zaporozhye region). A detailed study of the concentration and the dynamics of its functioning during the winter period was carried out. By the method of absolute counting of birds, the estimation of the gathering process on the roost {{in the night and}} dispersal from roost in the morning was carried out twice a week (a total of 47 days of observation in the morning and evening). We selected the following essential parameters: time of the beginning and ending of the process of dispersal from the roost in the morning and gathering at the roost in the evening; time – study of birds’ flight activity in these intervals; the number and species composition of birds; directions of flights with their mapping; weather conditions. Within the city of Melitopol during the winter period of 2014 – 2015, corvids (Rook, Western <b>Jackdaw,</b> <b>Eurasian</b> Magpie and Common Raven) form one central roost. The total number of birds at the roost was typically 18 thousand individuals. The collective roost exists from the beginning of October till the end of March. The analysis of dynamics of the birds’ number during the existence of the collective showed a wide amplitude of fluctuation in the range of 1, 000 – 5, 000 individuals during autumn (10 times) and spring (5 times) migration. By the end of November migration ends, the number of birds has stabilized, and the location of the night roost becomes permanent. In winter the gathering is more stable and fluctuations in number lie within the limits of 500 individuals (8 times). The number of birds that roost collectively decreased from mid – March. In this article considerable attention is paid to processes of the birds’ dispersal from the roost site and gathering at the roost at night. The observations showed a high degree of dependence on day length and different intensity of these types of daily activity. During the analysis of the process of morning dispersal of birds from the collective roost, seasonal differences in the time of dispersal were found. In the winter months this period was significantly shorter than in the autumn and spring. The duration of dispersal of birds from the roost (28. 4 ± 9 min; lim – 15 – 45 min) was reliably less than that of gathering at the roost (87. 9 ± 14. 8 min; lim – 30 – 115 min); the difference of averages is significant for the highest probability threshold of р ≥ 0. 001 for the entire observation period. As a result of research on dispersal and gathering of birds at the roost site, the basic strategies of the birds’ behaviour were revealled. For morning dispersal of birds from the territory of the roost the strategy of “gathering with a pause” (16 registrations; 35. 6 %) is dominant. The strategy of “the damped wave” is sub dominant (14; 31. 1 %). The lowest percentage was taken up by the strategy of “three peaks” (1; 2. 2 %). For the evening gathering of birds at the roost, the strategy of “two peaks” is dominant. The lowest percentage was taken up by the strategy of “gathering with a pause” (2; 4. 5 %). The overall species diversity within a gathering and on the routes of birds’ flights reached 24 species. The undisputed dominant in numbers was the Rook, and the subdominan was the Jackdaw. Thus, corvids form the basis of the ornithological complex of the forest – park zone of Melitopol in the autumn and spring period...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} and abundance of Corvidae species in Zhytomyr region was studied {{in terms of}} the urban-rural gradient. We selected Rook (Corvus frugilegus L.), <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Jackdaw</b> (C. monedula L.), Hooded Crow (C. cornix L.), Common Raven (C. corax L.), Eurasian Magpie (Pica pica L.) and Eurasian Jay (Garrulus glandarius L.) for our observations during 2009 – 2012. Some 38 survey routes totaling more than 8000 km were surveyed in 21 settlements in Zhytomyr region. Among them 13 routes were in Zhytomyr city. The average density of Rooks was 55. 9 birds/km 2. We found a strong correlation between Rook density and rural-urban gradient and observed that the numbers of wintering Rooks in cities significantly increased due to the influx from villages. The peak number of Rooks in villages was registered in the breeding and post-breeding seasons while in the cities it was high in winter and during the spring migration. The average density of Eurasian Magpies in the study area was 8. 7 birds/km 2 and we registered weak correlation with the urban-rural gradient. Their maximum density in urban habitats was in the winter period whereas the highest density in rural habitats was fixed in the summer months. The density of Magpies varied insignificantly within a narrow range during the three years of research, which suggests the species has successfully adjusted to the transformed landscapes. Average density of Hooded Crows in towns was 6. 6 birds/km 2. The linear relationship between the urban-rural gradient and the density of this species was rather weak. In the breeding period, the birds’ density was considerably higher in urban habitats. We also registered that the average density of Hooded Crows changed insignificantly but gradually increased during the study period. The average density of Eurasian Jackdaws was 9. 7 birds/km 2 and had high annual dynamics. It also changed significantly during the three years of research. The average density of Eurasian Jays was 2. 4 birds/km 2 and varied significantly in different settlements, although the fluctuation range was small (0. 1 – 9. 3 birds/km 2). We registered an expansion in the breeding distribution of Eurasian Jays in recent years i. e. the birds began to nest in old urban neighborhoods and small central parks of large cities. However, the number of birds naturally decreased along the gradient of landscape transformation. The impact of urban-rural gradient on Eurasian Jay density was significant but the correlation was weak and negative. The density of this species was highest in small villages (4. 9 birds/km 2) and the lowest in medium-sized cities (1. 5 birds/km 2). The seasonal density of Jays varied significantly and the greatest value was registered in the post-breeding period. In urban areas the birds’ density was much higher in winter compared to the nesting period, and in villages we observed the reverse situation. The number of Eurasian Jays remained almost stable in all the settlements during the study period indicating the stability of the local populations. The average density of the Common Raven was 1. 3 birds/km 2 and the highest density was registered in small villages (2. 2 birds/km 2), the lowest – in the townships (small urban type settlements) (0. 6 birds/km 2). The urban-rural gradient significantly affected the {{spatial distribution}} of Common Ravens, but we cannot claim an increase or decrease in their numbers along the gradient of urbanization, since the value of this indicator also depended on habitat conditions in each specific settlement. The spatial distribution of Common Ravens varied seasonally and the highest density was typical in winter due to food migrations towards human settlements...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} and abundance of Corvidae species was studied in Zhytomyr region {{with a focus}} on rural and urban differences in the studied parameters. We selected Rook (Corvus frugilegus L.), Western Jackdaw (C. monedula L.), Hooded Crow (C. cornix L.), Eurasian Magpie (Pica pica L.), Eurasian Jay (Garrulus glandarius L.), and Common Raven (Corvus corax L.). All observations were made during 2009 – 2012. During the study period some 38 survey paths of more than 8, 000 km were surveyed in 21 settlements of Zhytomyr region, among them 13 were in Zhytomyr city. The aim of our study was to establish the number and density of Corvidae in different seasons in the settlements of Zhytomyr region along a rural-urban gradient. The average density of Rooks was 55. 9 ind. /km 2. We also found a strong correlation between Rook density and the rural-urban gradient and observed that the number of Rooks wintering in cities significantly increased due to the influx from villages. The peak number of Rooks in villages was registered in the breeding and post-breeding season while in the cities it was high in winter and during the spring migration. The average density of Eurasian Magpie in the study area was 8. 7  ind. /km 2 and had a weak correlation with the urban-rural gradient. The density of Eurasian Magpies in urban areas differs significantly only from the density of birds in villages with a population of ca. 1, 000 people. The density of Magpies varied insignificantly within a narrow range during the three years of research, remaining relatively stable, which suggests that the species successfully adjusts to conditions in transformed landscapes. The urban-rural gradient significantly affects the density of Hooded Crows. The average density of birds in towns was 6. 6 ind. /km 2. In breeding period the urban birds had a low density and rural crows, on the contrary, had a high density, the density of birds in the nesting period was greater than in autumn and winter, due to the distribution of birds in their breeding territories and the start of the reproductive cycle. The average density of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Jackdaw</b> was 9. 7 ind. /km 2 and the rural-urban gradient significantly affected the number of birds. For jackdaws we registered high annual population dynamics. The peak number of birds was observed in the winter period in cities and small towns while in villages it was registered in the breeding and post-breeding season. The average density of Eurasian Jay was 2. 4 ind. /km 2 and varied significantly in different settlements, although the fluctuation range was small (0. 1 – 9. 3 ind. /km 2). The number of this species naturally decreases along the gradient of landscape transformation. The highest average density was typical in small villages (4. 9  ind. /km 2) and the lowest was found in medium-sized cities (1. 5 ind. /km 2). We have identified certain patterns in the seasonal dynamic of Eurasian Jays relative to the type of settlement. In urban areas the birds’ density was much higher in winter compared to the nesting period, and in villages we observed the reverse situation. The average density of Common Raven was 1. 3 ind. /km 2. The highest density was registered in small villages and was 2. 2 ind. /km 2, and the smallest in the villages of urban type (0. 6 ind. /km 2). The urban-rural gradient significantly affected the {{spatial distribution}} of Common Raven, but we cannot state that this bird increased or decreased its number along the gradient of urbanization, since the value of this indicator also depended on habitat conditions in specific settlements. The spatial distribution of Common Ravens varied seasonally and the highest density was typical in winter due to food migrations to human settlements...|$|E
