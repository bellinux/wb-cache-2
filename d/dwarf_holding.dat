50|$|George Devereux {{and others}} have argued that cauda, or οὐρά (oura) in Greek sources, is a {{euphemism}} for the penis of the October Horse, which {{could be expected to}} contain more blood for the suffimen. The tail itself, however, was a magico-religious symbol of fertility or power. The practice of attaching a horse's tail to a helmet may originate in a desire to appropriate the animal's power in battle; in the Iliad, Hector's horse-crested helmet is a terrifying sight. In the iconography of the Mithraic mysteries, the tail of the sacrificial bull is often grasped, as is the horse's tail in depictions of the Thracian Rider god, as if to possess its power. A pinax from Corinth depicts a <b>dwarf</b> <b>holding</b> his phallus with both hands while standing on the tail of a stallion carrying a rider; although the dwarf has sometimes been interpreted as the horse-threatening Taraxippus, the phallus is more typically an apotropaic talisman (fascinum) to ward off malevolence.|$|E

500|$|It {{had first}} been {{thought that the}} dwarfs would be {{the main focus of}} the story, and many {{sequences}} were written for the seven characters. However, at a certain point, it was decided that the main thrust of the story was provided by the relationship between the Queen and Snow White. For this reason, several sequences featuring the dwarfs were cut from the film. The first, which was animated in its entirety before being cut, showed Doc and Grumpy arguing about whether Snow White should stay with them. Another, also completely animated, would have shown the dwarfs eating soup noisily and messily; Snow White unsuccessfully attempts to teach them how to eat 'like gentlemen'. A partially animated sequence involved the <b>dwarfs</b> <b>holding</b> a [...] "lodge meeting" [...] in which they try to think of a gift for Snow White; this was to be followed by the elaborate 'bed building sequence', in which the dwarfs and the forest animals construct and carve a bed for the princess. This also was cut, as it was thought to slow down the movement of the story. The soup-eating and bed-building sequences were animated by Ward Kimball, who was sufficiently discouraged by their removal to consider leaving the studio, however Disney persuaded him to stay by promoting him to supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket in his next feature Pinocchio (1940).|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of light curve fits to two DBV white dwarfs, PG 1351 + 489 and GD 358. For both fits, we include recent {{improvements}} in calculations re-lating the bolometric and observed flux variations. We provide a preliminary map of convection across the DB instability strip, and we show how this allows us to choose between two possible spectroscopic fits to PG 1351 + 489. Astrophysical Context White dwarf stars come in two basic varieties: those with nearly pure helium surface layers (DBs) and those with nearly pure hydrogen surface layers (DAs). Each of these types contains a subtype of pulsators, denoted by DBV and DAV, respectively. In fact, the DBV GD 358 is the original member {{of the class of}} DBVs: it was discovered and predicted to pulsate by Winget (Winget 1982; Winget et al. 1982) and, as such, it is probably the most extensively studied DBV. Since ∼ 98 % of all stars become white <b>dwarfs,</b> white <b>dwarfs</b> <b>hold</b> the key to understanding late stages of stellar evolution. In particular, the pulsators, through their observed oscillation frequencies, provide us with detailed infor-mation about their internal structure.

40|$|The {{search for}} small planets {{orbiting}} late M <b>dwarfs</b> <b>holds</b> {{the promise of}} detecting Earth-size planets for which their atmospheres could be characterised within the next decade. The recent discovery of TRAPPIST- 1 entertains hope that these systems are common around hosts located {{at the bottom of}} the main sequence. In this Letter, we investigate the ability of the repurposed Kepler mission (K 2) to probe planetary systems similar to TRAPPIST- 1. We perform a consistent data analysis of 189 spectroscopically confirmed M 5. 5 to M 9 late M dwarfs from campaigns 1 - 6 to search for planet candidates and inject transit signals with properties matching TRAPPIST- 1 b and c. We find no transiting planet candidates across our K 2 sample. Our injection tests show that K 2 is able to recover both TRAPPIST- 1 planets for 10 % of the sample only, mainly because of the inefficient throughput at red wavelengths resulting in Poisson-limited performance for these targets. Increasing injected planetary radii to match GJ 1214 b's size yields a recovery rate of 70 %. The strength of K 2 is its ability to probe a large number of cool hosts across the different campaigns, out of which the recovery rate of 10 % may turn into bona-fide detections of TRAPPIST- 1 like systems within the next two years.

Low-mass cluster {{galaxies are}} the most common galaxy type in the {{universe}} and are at a cornerstone of our understanding of galaxy formation, cluster luminosity functions, dark matter and the formation of large scale structure.

40|$|Brown dwarfs are not massive {{enough to}} be stars, nor are they planets in the {{traditional}} sense. They are often found in isolation but may also be companions to stars. They share some characteristics with stars and others with planets, and occupy the mass range in between: from about 75 to about 10 Jupiter masses. Although there {{is the potential for}} an identity crisis (1), brown <b>dwarfs</b> may <b>hold</b> clues to the formation of stars as well as planets. The identification of hundreds of brown dwarfs over the past 5 years in the solar neighborhood and in young star clusters (see the figure) has led to widespread interest in their origin. [For a discussion of brown dwarf chemistry, see (2). ] How can free-floating objects with inferred masses as low as 10 Jupiter masses form? One possibility is that brown dwarfs form {{as a result of the}} turbulent fragmentation and contraction of molecular cloud cores–that is, in the same way as stars. In 1976, Low and Lynden-Bell (3) calculated that the Jeans mass (the minimum mass for a cloud fragment to overcome pressure and collapse under gravity) could be as small as about 7 Jupiter masses, comparable to the masses of some planets detected around nearby Sun-like stars and below the threshold of 13 Jupiter masses for deuterium burning.

40|$|The NASA Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) has {{discovered}} {{almost all the}} known {{members of the new}} class of Y-type brown dwarfs. Most of these Y dwarfs have been identified as isolated objects in the field. It is known that binaries with L- and T-type brown dwarf primaries are less prevalent than either M-dwarf or solar-type primaries, they tend to have smaller separations and are more frequently detected in near-equal mass configurations. The binary statistics for Y-type brown dwarfs, however, are sparse, and so it is unclear if the same trends that hold for L- and T-type brown <b>dwarfs</b> also <b>hold</b> for Y-type ones. In addition, the detection of binary companions to very cool Y dwarfs may well be the best means available for discovering even colder objects. We present results for binary properties of a sample of five WISE Y dwarfs with the Gemini Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics System (GeMS). We find no evidence for binary companions in these data, which suggests these systems are not equal-luminosity (or equal-mass) binaries with separations larger than ~ 0. 5 - 1. 9 AU. For equal-mass binaries at an age of 5 Gyr, we find that the binary binding energies ruled out by our observations (i. e. 10 ^ 42 erg) are consistent with those observed in previous studies of hotter ultra-cool dwarfs.

50|$|While precise fitting of the bulge, disk, and halo density {{profiles}} is {{a rather}} complicated process, it is straightforward to model the observables of rotating galaxies through this relationship.

Additionally, detailed investigations of the rotation curves of low-surface-brightness galaxies (LSB galaxies) in the 1990s and of their position on the Tully-Fisher relation showed that LSB galaxies had to have dark matter haloes that are more extended and less dense than those of HSB galaxies and thus surface brightness is related to the halo properties.
