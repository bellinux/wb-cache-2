50|$|In March 1975, a motor with a {{built-in}} <b>electronic</b> <b>governor</b> went on the market, allowing the company to move into new markets for cassette tape recorders, home stereo equipment and other household electronics. The RF-510G was born. It sold for 400 yen, the same price as an outdated mechanical governor. At first, electronics companies were somewhat leery of working with a supplier that got its start making motors for toy cars. But one after another, brand name manufacturers chose the quality and price of the RF-510G, and the Mabuchi brothers helped bring affordable Japanese radio cassette decks, portable headphone stereo CD players, and numerous other products in the audio visual field, to consumers across the world.|$|E

50|$|By {{manufacturing}} Japanese designed <b>electronic</b> <b>governor</b> motors {{overseas in}} Hong Kong and Taiwan, Mabuchi Motor reduced {{the cost of}} boomboxes through mass production of the motors that operated their cassette tapes. In December 1972, Mabuchi's exporting arm, Mabuchi World Trade Co., Ltd. (formerly Mabuchi Shoji Co., Ltd.), was merged with the domestic sales (business) division. A sales (business) department was opened {{at the site of}} Mabuchi World Trade Co., Ltd. (Nihonbashi, Chuo Ward, Tokyo). In order to expand production at Mabuchi Taiwan Co., Ltd., in October 1973 a new factory was constructed and existing production facilities were modernized. In March 1974, as part of efforts to streamline business management, new, high-precision machine tools reflecting the latest technology were introduced and added to the machine tool division of the main factory. In addition, Mabuchi Precision Industries, Ltd. was established in Tatebayashi City, Gunma Prefecture for in-house production of motor shafts. An airplane motor went on the market in July as a new power source for model airplanes.|$|E
5000|$|Next, tape {{recorders}} changed from open-reel to cassette tape, and in 1972 the radio cassette deck, or [...] "boombox", was released; {{it became a}} popular for personal use mainly among young people. As far as Mabuchi Motor was concerned, the key part of a radio cassette deck was {{that it must be}} able to spin quietly and stably to produce quality sound. The rotation speed could not change even with changes in voltage, temperature or load. A regular DC motor would not suffice; instead, the company had to develop a new motor with the capability to adjust its speed, a [...] "governor motor". In the past, the company's engineers had experimented with both types of governor motor, mechanical and electronic governors. But since {{it would be difficult to}} reduce the price of a mechanical governor, while electronic governors were growing cheaper all the time, Takaichi Mabuchi decided to proceed with an <b>electronic</b> <b>governor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Different {{designs of}} {{governors}} {{have been used}} since the mid-19th century to control the speeds of the water turbines. A variety of flyball systems, or first-generation governors, were used during the first 100 years of water turbine speed controls. In early flyball systems, the flyball component countered by a spring acted directly to the valve of the turbine or the wicket gate to control {{the amount of water}} that enters the turbines. Newer systems with mechanical governors started around 1880. An early mechanical governors is a servomechanism that comprises a series of gears that use the turbine's speed to drive the flyball and turbine's power to drive the control mechanism. The mechanical governors were continued to be enhanced in power amplification through the use of gears and the dynamic behavior. By 1930, the mechanical governors had many parameters that could be set on the feedback system for precise controls. In the later part of the twentieth century, <b>electronic</b> <b>governors</b> and digital systems started to replace the mechanical <b>governors.</b> In the <b>electronic</b> <b>governors,</b> also known as second-generation governors, the flyball was replaced by rotational speed sensor but the controls were still done through analog systems. In the modern systems, also known as third-generation governors, the controls are performed digitally by algorithms that are programmed to the computer of the governor.|$|R

Speed control was by an <b>electronic</b> <b>governor</b> and a frequency generator mounted {{on one of the}} traction motors, with an overriding mechanical governor, connected to one of the axles on the trailer cars. All trains were fitted with a fail-safe trip valve connected to the emergency brakes, and the mechanical governor operated this device if the speed exceeded 25 mph when the 420 code was not being received, if the speed exceeded 50 mph under any circumstances, or if the speed exceeded 11.5 mph when the train was being operated in 'slow manual' mode. The trains could be driven manually at speeds up to 25 mph if safety codes were still being received, or at 10 mph if no codes were being received, either because of a failure or because the train was in the depot, where the tracks were not coded.|$|E

There have been several accidents and incidents where Helicycles have lost power in/near hover, resulting in minor damage to the skids and some airframes, but no serious injuries. Most of these were attributed to a radio-frequency interference (RFI) problem with the <b>electronic</b> <b>governor,</b> and the issue was reportedly solved with better shielding in 2005. At least one accident may have been caused by a crack in a fuel line due to lack of mechanical support between a manifold and a fuel injection port. Another accident involved flight into high-voltage power distribution wires, but the aircraft was able to fly again, following repairs, and the pilot was not seriously injured. The NTSB report on the fatal accident indicates extensive damage to the helicopter due to impact with a body of water. An examination of the anti-torque pedal assembly by the NTSB Materials Laboratory revealed that the fracture surface patterns found on it were consistent with a bending overstress separation.

5000|$|A vital {{component}} of all diesel engines is a mechanical or <b>electronic</b> <b>governor</b> which regulates the idling speed and maximum {{speed of the}} engine by controlling the rate of fuel delivery. Unlike Otto-cycle engines, incoming air is not throttled and a diesel engine without a governor cannot have a stable idling speed and can easily overspeed, resulting in its destruction. Mechanically governed fuel injection systems are driven by the engine's gear train. [...] These systems {{use a combination of}} springs and weights to control fuel delivery relative to both load and speed. [...] Modern electronically controlled diesel engines control fuel delivery by use of an electronic control module (ECM) or electronic control unit (ECU). The ECM/ECU receives an engine speed signal, as well as other operating parameters such as intake manifold pressure and fuel temperature, from a sensor and controls the amount of fuel and start of injection timing through actuators to maximise power and efficiency and minimise emissions. Controlling the timing of the start of injection of fuel into the cylinder is a key to minimizing emissions, and maximizing fuel economy (efficiency), of the engine. The timing is measured in degrees of crank angle of the piston before top dead centre. For example, if the ECM/ECU initiates fuel injection when the piston is 10° before TDC, the start of injection, or timing, is said to be 10° BTDC. Optimal timing will depend on the engine design as well as its speed and load, and is usually 4° BTDC in 1,350-6,000 HP, net, [...] "medium speed" [...] locomotive, marine and stationary diesel engines.|$|E

Much like the later production A904 with a wide ratio gear a double wrap low-reverse band is used. An extension housing mounted (New Process built) overdrive unit was bolted {{to the rear of the}} case to provide a total of four forward speeds; the extension housing and its internals interchange with the 46-48RH/RE (A518/618) - when overhauling the overdrive unit transmission rebuilders usually would use replacement parts from the A518/618 overdrive section since the A500 internals are light duty e.g. number of friction discs and thick pressure plates.

40|$|In {{rural areas}} of many countries, the supply of {{electricity}} has always been scarce due to the relative isolation from the national electricity distribution system. In New Zealand for example, many high country farm houses rely almost entirely on diesel generating sets for power. This method of power generation costs more than urban electricity supply. However, a recent advance in control technology, and a new turbine concept have shown that very small hydro power schemes also known as microhydro, can now produce urban quality electricity at a cost not much greater than urban supply. Through research and testing a 5 kW microhydro generating set was developed. The design of the micro hydro generating set involves the utilisation of the latest control technology, and proprietary components. The single most important contribution {{to the development of}} the microhydro generating set was the use of an <b>electronic</b> load <b>governor</b> with the run-of-the-river principle which results in constant flow operation of the turbine. This eliminates the need for a precision speed governor and accurate turbine flow control and thus greatly simplifies the turbine design. A malfunction protection system and a load management system have also been incorporated to allow maximum utilisation of the power output without risk of damage to the generating equipment. The use of a Delphi <b>electronic</b> load <b>governor</b> in conjunction with a brushless, self excited and self regulated synchronous generator have produced a stable electrical output of 5 kW at 230 V, 50 Hz, AC, when using an appropriate flywheel to provide shaft inertia to dampen out electrical transients. It was found that shaft inertia of four times that recommended by the governor manufacturer, was required. One of the simplest turbines is a centrifugal pump operating in the reverse mode. Tests have shown that centrifugal pumps perform exceptionally well as power recovery turbines, with efficiencies similar or in some cases even greater than that for the pumping case without any modification. Consequently, the combination of well established mechanical and control hardware, simplifies the design and installation of a microhydro scheme to a technical task rather than one requiring the expertise of a design engineer. A set of five machines was designed, covering the range of heads and flows most commonly encountered in hilly isolated areas.

40|$|Abstract Switched {{reluctance}} motor (SRM) drive has remarkable characteristics {{that make it}} attractive for high-speed applications. As the motor’s speed increases {{the shape of the}} current waveform changes in such way that limits the production of motoring torque. At high speeds, it is possible for the phase current never reaches the desired value due to the self e. m. f. of the motor, therefore, the torque falls off. In order to remedy this problem, the phase turn on angle is advanced in such way that the phase commutation begins sooner. Advancing the commutation angle offers the advantages of getting the current into the phase winding while the inductance of the phase is low, and also of having a little more time to get the current out of the phase winding before the rotor reaches the negative torque region. Since the SRM drive is a variable speed motor then, the amount of advancing for the turn on angle should be accomplished automatically according to the speed of the motor, meaning, as the motor speed increases so should the turn on angle and vice versa. In this respect, this paper introduces an <b>electronic</b> <b>governor</b> using a P. L.

This machine characteristically exhibited increasing vibration levels with increasing speed, {{in the upper}} portion of the speed range. It was suspected that this ramping vibration was due to operation near a critical speed. The purpose of this analysis was to identify {{the source of this}} high vibration with the present rotor and hearings and then to determine the best solution to the problem. The computer analysis determined that the original rotor/bearing system was operating near the second critical speed. The predicted peaks were within nine percent to thirteen percent of miming speed (8400 cpm). The optimum solution was to shorten the shaft at the governor end and replace the bearings. The shaft modification consisted of cutting off the governor worm gear assembly and replacing it with an <b>electronic</b> <b>governor</b> disk. This new bearing design was also a four-shoe tilting pad journal bearing, but it had longer pads and higher preload than the existing design. Because there was concern about coupling gear tooth lock-up in the original design, a dry, flexible-element coupling design was evaluated. The coupling change was also of interest because of its potential effect on moving the second critical speed. However, in this ease, the analysis determined that the rotor vibration characteristics were very close with either the existing gear coupling or the dry coupling. Therefore, the justification fo r changing couplings would be that the dry coupling would not be susceptible to drive tooth lockup and unbalance eccentricity due to tooth wear...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. In recent years, agricultural farms in Peru have started to implement equipment for anaerobic digestion of the organic residues of their production. At first, the main objective of the implementation was to obtain bio-fertilizers, but in this process, biogas was also obtained. Farms in Peru did not use this biofuel in any process, {{which is why they}} freed it or burnt it in torches, polluting the environment in both ways, due to the biogas content of methane. This last fuel has a high global warming potential (GWP) and carbon dioxide, result of the biogas burning is also a pollutant. In this context, an experimental device was designed and built to evaluate the performance of a Diesel cycle engine generator set of 40 kW using diesel and biogas as fuels. The generator set had a fixed speed of 1800 RPM. The tests were initially carried out using only diesel as fuel to obtain comparable parameters. The tests were made simulating an electric load of 62. 5 %. After this, a conversion kit was installed to allow the use of biogas in the engine. This equipment controls the Duty Cycle, which is a value between 0 and 1 that indicates the percentage of time the injectors are opened. The kit used as input signals the generated power, the <b>electronic</b> <b>governor</b> signal and the exhaust gases temperature. Then, tests were carried out partially substituting diesel for biogas. The biogas used for the test contained approximately 40 % of methane. The results indicated that for higher Duty Cycles (higher quantities of biogas), the exhaust temperatures increased, due to the superior temperature of biogas combustion. With the percentage of methane available in the biogas, the substitution rates reached 17, 9 % and 36, 7 %, maintaining the generated power and reducing significantly the consumption of diesel. This technology makes possible the modular production of electric energy in agricultural farms, usually isolated, allowing the use of biogas commonly produced in the same place with the organic residues they manage, diminishing pollution, reducing costs and using the energy for useful purposes. dc 201...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 123 - 132 Two similar large steam {{turbines}} in an ethylene plant are profiled. One drives the cracked gas compressor train {{and the other}} drives the propylene refrigeration compressor. The two machines are similar and this paper concentrates on the turbine driving the cracked gas compressors. Both turbines {{had a history of}} high vibration, short bearing life, and unusual sensitivity to thermal changes and imbalance due to operation near the second critical speed. In addition, numerous blade failures had occurred. When additional turbine performance was required, a complete review of the entire turbine including the blade designs, rotordynarnics, and governor operation was commissioned. The performance upgrade included new blading, disks, seals, and other changes to the steam path. A turning gear was added for slow-roll operation to relieve thermal effects and rotor bow. A technique was developed for mounting the turbine disks on the rotor to minimize axial disk runout and local couple imbalances. The high bearing temperatures and high vibration issues were addressed with changes in shaft and bearing designs. A submerged arc welding process increased the governor end journal diameter from 51 / 4 inches to 7 inches. A rotordynamic optimization analysis resulted in replacing the tilting pad bearing on the governor end with an offset-half lobed journal bearing. The tilting pad bearings on the exhaust end of the turbines were retained but redesigned for optimum performance. Interchangeability of bearings between the two machines was maintained. These shaft and bearing changes resulted in a significant reduction in babbitt temperature, shaft vibration, and imbalance sensitivity as well as control of the second critical speed. The interaction of the rotor with the foundation substructure was found to be significant, and its inclusion in the analysis was required to properly design the optimized bearings. The blade design changes and steam path changes produced a more reliable design and greater than the required extra power. The addition of a turning gear drive has eliminated the thermal bow problems. A new <b>electronic</b> <b>governor</b> system has eliminated the wear associated with the original hydraulic governor.
