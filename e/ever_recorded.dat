5|$|Hurricane Patricia was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclone <b>ever</b> <b>recorded</b> in the Western Hemisphere and the second-most intense worldwide in terms of barometric pressure. It also featured the highest one-minute maximum sustained winds <b>ever</b> <b>recorded</b> in a tropical cyclone. Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the Gulf of Tehuantepec in mid-October2015, Patricia was first classified a tropical depression on October20. Initial development was slow, with only modest strengthening within {{the first day of}} its classification. The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia, the twenty-fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on October22. A well-defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a Category5 hurricane in just 24hours—a near-record pace. The magnitude of intensification was poorly forecast and both forecast models and meteorologists suffered from record-high prediction errors.|$|E
