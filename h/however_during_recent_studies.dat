40|$|Cancer {{research}} {{over the}} past decades has focused on neoplastic cells, or a fraction of them, i. e. tumor stem cells, as the ultimate causes of tumorigenesis. <b>However,</b> <b>during</b> <b>recent</b> years, scientists {{have come to realize}} that tumorigenesis is not a solo act of neoplastic cells, but rather a cooperative process in which the roles of numerous types of non-neoplastic cells should be recognized. These tumor-residing non-neoplastic cells constitute the so-called tumor-associated stroma, which in certain cases even greatly surpasses the neoplastic cellular compartment that was previously thought of as a sole determiner leading to a seemingly autonomous growth pattern. In this review, we summarize several recent research highlights that have unveiled many previously unappreciated roles for microenvironmental factors, especially during the initiation stage of tumorigenesis. It is becoming increasingly clear that the stroma’s regulatory effects constitute not only an essential force for maintaining tumor growth, but also primary causes initiating tumorigenesis...|$|R
