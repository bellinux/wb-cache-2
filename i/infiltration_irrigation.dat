In order to determine Hydraulic Conductivity in a soil column during unsaturated flow, experiments were performed in the laboratory. A sandy (S) soil sample of known Hydraulic Conductivity at saturation (KS) was placed uniformly in a transparent column. Using a pump, water was applied at {{the surface of the}} soil column in certain supplies (Qi), while soil moisture (θ) was measured using TDR probes. At the same time, soil pore pressure (h) was measured using pressure transducers. The cumulative volume of the outgoing water (V) of the column was measured. Experimental data were fitted by Van Genuhten's Hydraulic Conductivity model. The results of the above experimental procedure constitute useful tools for the simulation of water movement in unsaturated soils and can be the outset for further research...|$|E

This study aimed at determining the hydrochemical changes produced by intensive aquifer exploitation and highlighting water quality modifications, taking as example the Valle de Toluca, Salamanca, and San Luis Potosi aquifers in Mexico’s highlands. There, elements such as fluoride, arsenic, iron, and manganese have been detected, resulting from the introduction of older groundwater with longer residence times and distinctive chemical composition (regional flows).

40|$|CIMMYT is {{committed}} to improving livelihoods in developing countries by increasing the productivity and profitability of farming systems while sustaining natural resources. Conservation agriculture — the use of reduced or zero-tillage, retention of rational amounts of crop residues, and use of viable crop rotations — can reduce production costs and help meet {{the need for more}} economically sound, environmentally friendly, sustainable agricultural production systems for rainfed and irrigated areas. This paper focuses on the influence of tillage and crop residue management on soil quality and includes results from two long-term trials established in the early 1990 ’s in two contrasting agro-ecological systems in Mexico: (1) a low-input, semi-arid, rainfed system in the central highlands with planting on the flat and (2) a high-input, arid, irrigated system in the northwestern Mexico with bed planting. In both systems, zero-tillage with residue retention resulted in higher or comparable yields than the conventional systems and increased soil biological, physical and chemical soil quality. Zero-tillage with residue retention enhanced water availability, soil structure, and nutrient availability more than conventional tillage. Soil microbial diversity increased under zero-tillage with residue retention, facilitating integrated pest management. As well in the rainfed semi-arid zero-tillage system as the irrigated permanent raised bed system, the (partial) retention of the crop residues was necessary to maintain soil quality in zero-tillage systems.

40|$|Grey water {{consists}} of the discharges from kitchen sinks, showers, baths, washing machines and hand basins. The amount of grey water produced per person in The Netherlands is about 90 Ld- 1, accounting for up to 75 % of the wastewater volume produced by households, and over 90 % if vacuum toilets are installed. Grey water is relatively low in pollution and therefore, after appropriate treatment, has great potential for reuse in non-potable applications such as <b>infiltration,</b> <b>irrigation,</b> toilet flushing, laundry water, etc. The goal of this thesis {{was to develop a}} treatment concept for grey water to exploit its reuse potential. A special focus of this thesis was set on the study of organic micropollutants from personal care and household chemicals. Grey water (from 32 houses in Sneek, The Netherlands) contains, on average, 724 - 150 mgL- 1 of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 27 - 12 mgL- 1 of total nitrogen, 7. 2 - 4. 2 mgL- 1 of phosphorus and 41 - 12 mgL- 1 of anionic surfactants. The high biodegradability of grey water (70 - 5 %) indicated the possibility of recovering COD as methane. Biological treatment of grey water was conducted in three systems, aerobic, anaerobic and combined anaerobic + aerobic, at a total hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 - 13 hours at 32 °C. Aerobic treatment in a sequencing batch reactor resulted in COD removal of 90 %, which was significantly higher than 51 % removal by anaerobic treatment in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. Grey water treatment in a combined anaerobic + aerobic system resulted in a COD removal efficiency of 89 %. The application of a UASB reactor for the pre-treatment of grey water yielded a small amount of energy. Therefore, the aerobic system was preferred for grey water treatment. Bioflocculation of grey water in a high loaded membrane bioreactor was tested as alternative to aerobic treatment. The concentrated grey water of this process can potentially increase the methane yield by 73 % within ‘new sanitation' concepts. Eighteen compounds of personal care products and household chemicals (UV- filters, fragrances, preservatives, biocides, surfactants) were measured in grey water at low gL- 1 levels. During biological treatment most of these compounds were partially removed. In general, the treatment in the aerobic system lead to the highest removal efficiencies of these compounds, where biodegradation and adsorption to sludge were the most likely removal mechanisms. However, the UV-filters PBSA and EHMC and the fragrance tonalide were poorly removed in the tested biological systems. Although reuse standards for these compounds do not exist, the post-reatment of aerobically treated effluent was recommended prior to reuse. Adsorption on activated carbon and ozonation were proven effective as post-treatment options for grey water...|$|E
40|$|Permanent {{raised bed}} (PRB) farming systems combine several {{elements}} (e. g. reduced tillage, controlled traffic, stubble retention) of conservation agriculture. PRB systems {{have recently been}} introduced into irrigated areas {{but there is a}} lack of information on the agronomic and irrigation performance of these systems under these conditions. Three years of field research into the performance of irrigated PRBs was conducted in south east Queensland, Australia and north west Pakistan. These studies benchmarked the irrigation performance of variously sized PRB systems and explored the impact of bed renovation method (no tillage (NT), shallow cultivation (SC) and blade ploughing (BP)) on soil hydro-physical properties (bulk density, soil moisture storage, <b>infiltration),</b> <b>irrigation</b> performance, crop yield and input water productivity (WP). Irrigation management strategies to improve lateral infiltration and irrigation performance were also investigated. The initial benchmarking study was conducted on two farms with clayey Vertisol (Australia) and three farms with sandy clay loam, Alfisol, (Pakistan) soils. The results showed low irrigation performance with excessive deep drainage potential. The irrigation application efficiency (Ea) on the clayey Vertisol and sandy clay loam was as low as 68 % and 50 %, requirement efficiency (Er) 96 % and 77 % and distribution uniformity (DU) 86 % and 66 %, respectively. However, the majority of the narrow beds (66 cm furrow spacing) were over-irrigated on the sandy clay loam while the wide beds (132 cm furrow spacing) were under-irrigated. Inappropriate renovation and bed furrow dimensions, sub-optimal irrigation management and poor lateral infiltration were the main factors likely to affect WP of irrigated PRBs. The evaluation of bed renovation methods found that BP on the clayey Vertisol reduced (~ 6 %) the average seasonal bulk density of the surface 0 - 30 cm compared to the NT treatment. BP was found to produce higher lateral infiltration into the beds than either NT or SC. Freshly applied BP and SC produced a higher (~ 23 %) cumulative infiltration than NT but the effect was transient and was not significant in the following season when the PRB renovation treatments were not freshly applied. The SC beds slump more than the BP and NT beds. The soil water content in the beds indicated that there was increased water storage associated with BP. PRB renovation (i. e. SC or BP) was found to reduce irrigation performance on the clayey Vertisol when the irrigation was farmer managed. The volume of irrigation water applied to the fresh SC and BP treatments increased by up 13 % and 55 %, and Ea was reduced by up to 9 % and 29 % respectively, compared with NT during the 2010 wheat and 2011 corn seasons. NT produced a higher wheat yield and WP, but the lower wheat yield in the cultivated treatments was associated with poor crop establishment from a rough soil surface and inadequate seeder performance in this season. In the subsequent seasons, there was no significant difference in either the crop yields or WP between the bed renovation treatments. Field trials investigating the effect of bed renovation on infiltration were conducted on both soils. Significant differences in the amount of water infiltrated and stored in the bed shoulder and bed middle were found for periods of wetting consistent with normal irrigation practices. This suggests that the general assumption of uniform soil moisture distribution across the beds is not valid for wide PRB systems. The three different renovation methods also significantly affected lateral infiltration, suggesting tillage may be used as a management tool to improve bed wetting in low infiltration soils and subsided beds. Infiltration and soil-water movement were simulated using Hydrus 2 D. The simulations were found to be well correlated with the measured field data and an evaluation for the three PRB renovation methods confirmed that NT had the slowest, and BP the fastest, potential to wet the bed middle of the wide PRBs. Increasing the furrow water head from 4 cm to furrow full of water was also shown to reduce wetting time by more than 30 %. Lateral infiltration was poor in the sandy clay loam. The shortest wetting time (~ 15 hrs) required to wet the bed middle of a 132 cm wide bed to field capacity occurred when furrow full water head was applied to the BP treated bed. However, even this period of wetting may be difficult to achieve using current irrigation practices in Pakistan. The graphical model outputs developed can be used in developing guidelines to optimise bed width and irrigation management to ensure adequate lateral infiltration with different PRB renovation methods. Strategies to optimise irrigation management and field design while ensuring adequate lateral infiltration into the bed middle were evaluated using the surface irrigation model SIRMOD. Optimising the inflow rate (Q) and the time to cut-off (Tco) for the particular field length was found to produce up to a 38 % irrigation water saving compared with existing practices. However, the majority of the wide beds on the sandy clay loam required higher inflow volumes than currently applied, which increased Er but reduced Ea. Optimising furrow length indicated a further improvement in irrigation performance. Similarly, Q and Tco optimisation together showed up to 35 % irrigation water saving and up to 33 % improved Ea for the most sub-optimally managed BP treatment. Decreased furrow length improved irrigation performance for freshly renovated PRB, while irrigation performance of settled bed furrows tended to increase with increased furrow length. Relating optimum Tco to water advance to furrow tail end (Ta) was sensitive to furrow length, Q and soil infiltration functions. The decision support guidelines developed were helpful in improving existing irrigation performance under both soil conditions. This research has shown that the existing irrigation performance of PRBs is often low and highly variable. A key constraint is the potential for poor lateral infiltration into the beds and inadequate wetting to the centre of wide beds. However, this work has also highlighted that the adoption of appropriate bed renovation methods (particularly BP) and irrigation management practices (e. g. Q and Tco) can substantially improve irrigation performance and input WP. Although the applicability of the specific decision support tools developed is restricted to the soil types and field conditions encountered, the general understanding and insight into the basic principles of performance optimisation and for agronomic and irrigation interactions is expected to be beneficial in refining understanding and the promotion of sustainable crop production under a wider range of environmental conditions. ...|$|E

The aquifer supplies water for the Ontario municipal water system, domestic and industrial uses, and irrigation. In response to this finding, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), the Oregon Water Resources Department (WRD), and Oregon State University (OSU) have initiated {{a study of the}} groundwater quality and hydrogeology of the aquifer. The study includes analyzing groundwater samples for nitrate and DCPA metabolites (by DEQ); hydrogeological characterization, including measuring water levels and aquifer hydraulic parameters (by WRD); and developing a numerical groundwater flow and solute transport model (by OSU). This paper presents a regional groundwater flow model that will be used to estimate aquifer parameters and groundwater velocities for input into a solute transport model, and to identify additional data needs. A two-dimensional, steady state, finite element model was calibrated to a set of 36 water level measurements taken by WRD personnel in late September 1988. The model incorporates recharge from <b>infiltration</b> of surface <b>irrigation</b> water and leakage from irrigation ditches and withdrawals by production wells. Transmissivity was estimated from five pumping tests and using aquifer thickness data from well logs. The model was calibrated using a trial and error procedure. Surface irrigation recharge rates were estimated by minimizing the mean-squared-error (MSE) between predicted and measured water levels at the 36 wells. The calibrated model produced an MSE of 25. 3 ft² and a mean error of 1. 0 feet. The estimated recharge from surface irrigation is about eight times that from leakage through unlined ditches; however, many small, unlined ditches were not modeled as separate line sources and were lumped with the irrigation recharge term. Therefore the model suggests both <b>irrigation</b> water <b>infiltration</b> and <b>irrigation</b> ditch leakage contribute significant quantities of recharge. The model suggests that Dork Canal and Arcadia Drain can be approximated as specified head boundaries and that recharge may occur from uplands aquifers. Model predictions would be most improved by better definition of leakage from irrigation supply ditches, groundwater interception by major drainage ditches and shallow drainage systems on individual farm tracts, and the rate of withdrawal by producing wells. For transient flow analyses, better definition of the aquifer storativity is needed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} develop novel {{approaches}} for reducing the after-care of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) sanitary landfills methods are required {{with which we can}} quantify the emission potential present in waste bodies. Currently full-scale experiments are being prepared at three Dutch landfills based on enhanced <b>infiltration</b> by <b>irrigation</b> and leachate recirculation in combination with landfill aeration. The aim is to reduce the emission potential as fast as possible by stimulating the biological degradation of organic matter in the waste body. Since the summer of 2012 a base line monitoring program has been implemented at the three landfills which has resulted in a data set which can be used to quantify the water balance using high frequency measurements of meteorological data and pumped volumes of leachate. A simple landfill-scale water balance model has been developed which links rainfall, evapo-transpiration, infiltration and leachate drainage. This approach provides us with a method which allows us to obtain a quantitative estimate of the probability distribution of flow velocities and the pore volume in the waste body associated with this flowing water. The parameters in this model are obtained using a data assimilation approach, where the complete parameter distributions using a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo approach with the objective to obtain the best fit of measured leachate volumes and solute concentrations.

40|$|Data is {{presented}} comparing <b>infiltration</b> of <b>irrigation</b> and rain water to potato crops planted in ridges and beds in East Anglia, UK. An automatic soil water station (ASWS) {{was used to}} monitor soil water content and potential in the two cultivation systems. The ASWS data indicated {{that most of the}} water bypassed the potatoes planted in ridges as irrigation water applied to the crop from a boom irrigator was shed off the ridges infiltrating in the furrows. This was due to the water repellent nature of the sandy soil and meant that the irrigation water bypassed the potatoes. A soil water deficit built up in the core of the ridge as the crop grew and was not replenished by irrigations. A second early potato crop planted in beds was more successful at capturing water as the flat bed increased water infiltration around the crop. This has major implications for cultivation practice, scab control and crop water management. Instruments measuring soil water potential, content, temperature and rainfall were connected to a data logger powered by a solar panel and proved a successful way of monitoring infiltration. Hourly data was collected so that a high temporal resolution data set could be constructed in order to increase conceptual understanding of hydrological processes at a scale appropriate to the crop. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} address {{groundwater}} resource sustainability, a conceptual three-dimensional, transient and anisotropic groundwater flow model comprising of six model layers was established to simulate the regional groundwater flow in the multilayered aquifer system of Yuncheng Basin of Northern China. Investigations indicate that the groundwater of Yuncheng Basin is extremely prone to over-exploitation and requires some quick and stringent attentions. The mean annual precipitation recharge, surface water discharge, <b>irrigation</b> <b>infiltration</b> and groundwater abstraction of sub-catchments of Yuncheng Basin {{are some of the}} parameters incorporated as input variable data. The model indicates that current well extraction rates are significantly less than annual groundwater recharge to the Basin. A model result for several scenarios tested by calibration and by adjustment of parameters like the hydraulic conductivity and storage yield indicates that extraction rates will be less than groundwater input to the Basin...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} program for prediction of the cation distribution resulting from irrigation of a layered soil was prepared. Half scale models of a ten-layer soil profile were constructed from chemically unaltered Qua Loam aid Qua Silt Loam soil samples A synthetic Colorado River water was the percolating solution. Comparison of predicted and experiments], results showed satisfactory agreement. A gypsum requirement prediction loop was {{inserted into the}} program. This loop predicted the quantities necessary to reduce the exchangeable sodium percentage of a given layer to a desired level. Intensive experimental investigation proved this method of prediction accurate. The dependence of the hydraulic conductivity of a soil upon its exchangeable sodium percentage was taken advantage of in an attempt at prediction of <b>infiltration</b> rates during <b>irrigation.</b> Despite elaborate precautions against interference by extraneous factors, the attempt was not successful. The source of error was probably {{the formation of a}} soil film of high exchangeable sodium percentage at the interface between the soil column and the percolating solution...|$|R
40|$|The Jouganjigawa Fan, {{an area of}} rice farming of 50 km 2, lies to the {{southeast}} ofToyama city and was formed in the Late Quarternary by terrestrial gravel deposi-tion by the Joganji River. To identify sources of water in shallow aquifers (maxi-mum depth 100 m) beneath the fan, studies of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in theground and surface waters of the fan have been made. Major rivers flowing ontothe fan are from higher-altitude catchments (maximum altitude 3000 m) and havelower 6 D and 6 18 O values than rainfall on the fan. The isotopic measurements indi-cate that the aquifers are mainly recharged by <b>infiltration</b> of the <b>irrigation</b> water,which {{is derived from the}} Joganji River, and local precipitations from the surface.

40|$|In {{southern}} Sri Lanka, irrigation {{influences the}} concentrations of faecal bacteria and inorganic toxic contaminants in groundwater. We develop a groundwater vulnerability map describing the potential human health implications of harmful constituents in the Uda Walawe Basin, by overlaying geological and land use data with information describing the irrigation system, the oxygen isotope composition of water bodies, and {{the concentrations of}} selected contaminants. Given the limited data available, we examine the spatial distribution of harmful constituents and the potential human health risks. Fluoride poisoning from groundwater is the greatest health threat in our study area, where fluoride concentrations ranging from 0. 1 to 9. 2 mg/L {{are associated with a}} geologic origin. Arsenic occurs in high concentrations, up to 0. 4 mg/L, in areas with low recharge, although the source of arsenic is not clear. Nitrate concentrations are low, ranging from 0. 4 to 23 mg/L, despite high fertilizer inputs, except in areas with low recharge and non-favourable reducing conditions, where concentrations up to 136 mg/L are found. Faecal bacteria decrease from surface water via shallow groundwater to deep groundwater. Irrigation water appears {{to play a major role}} in increasing microbial contamination and diluting inorganic constituents in groundwater. Hence, the most important determinants for mapping groundwater vulnerability are local geology and <b>infiltration</b> of <b>irrigation</b> water. The method we present provides a qualitative, yet practical, alternative to commonly used vulnerability mapping techniques for countries where high human health risk via consumption of groundwater is inevitable, and thus acts as a tool for selecting preventive and curative measures...|$|R
