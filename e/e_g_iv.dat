40|$|Introduction: Reducing {{laboratory}} {{errors and}} improving patient safety is receiving {{a lot of}} attention. Lipaemic samples are cause of analytical errors and present challenges for laboratories, particularly for those without ultracentrifuges. Lipaemia can originate from physiological (postprandial metabo-lism), para-physiological causes (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>IV</b> administration of lipids) as well as metabolic disturbances (e. g. hypertriglyceridaemia). Materials and methods: We have evaluated a procedure with 10 native lipaemic sample pools (triglyceride concentration range 11. 6 - 42. 7 mmol/L) for the ability to reduce lipid concentration using a high speed micro-centrifuge (double centrifuged at 21. 885 x g for 15 min) compared with an ultracen-trifuge, and provide accurate results. Results of sodium, creatinine, urate, total protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LD), magnesium and, cholesterol and triglyceride analysis on a Beckman DxC 800 analyser are presented. Results: Data from our tertiary level hospital showed ~ 0. 7 % of the samples received for lipid studies have triglyceride levels > 10 mmol/L which can potentially cause analytical interference. The mean differences from the neat aliquot to the ultracentrifuged and high speed centrifuged sample pools were: cholesterol 4. 9 mmol/L and 3. 1 mmol/L; and triglycerides 17. 4 mmol/L and 15. 0 mmol/L respectively. The data confirms high speed centrifugation is almost as effective as ultracentrifugation in lipid reduction. Conclusion: The procedure utilized in this study using a high speed micro-centrifuge showed it is effective in reducing lipid levels and provides a suitable alternative to ultracentrifuged samples to pro-vide accurate results...|$|E
40|$|E-selectin, L-selectin, and P-selectin {{are related}} cell {{adhesion}} molecules that bind via their lectin domains to sialyl Lewis x and related carbohydrate determinants. Reports {{have indicated that}} sulfated glycolipids and polysaccharides also bind selectins. To extend these findings, we compared binding of selectin-IgG chimeras to immobilized sulfated and sialylated glycosphingolipids. E-, L-, and P-selectin chimeras all bound to surfaces absorbed with 2, 3 -sialyl Lewis x glycolipid or sulfatide (galactosylceramide I 3 -sulfate) but not to surfaces adsorbed with control sulfated lipids (octadecyl sulfate, sphingosine sulfate). Notably, the L- and P-selectin chimeras but not E-selectin chimera bound to surfaces adsorbed with sulfoglucuronyl glycosphingolipids (SGNL lipids; <b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>IV</b> 3 glucuronylneolactotetraosylceramide V 3 -sulfate). These unusual lipids have been reported as antigenic determinants for monoclonal IgM antibodies produced in patients with neuropathy associated with paraproteinemia and react with the mouse monoclonal antibody HNK- 1. Binding of L- and P-selectin chimeras to SGNL lipids was specifically inhibited by appropriate anti-selectin antibodies. While binding of all three selectin chimeras to sialyl Lewis x was blocked by removal of calcium, binding to SGNL lipid was only modestly reduced by EDTA. Chemically desulfated SGNL lipid retained binding activity for L- and P-selectin chimeras, while methyl esterification of the glucuronic acid eliminated binding. We conclude that SGNL lipids, unlike sialyl Lewis x and sulfatides, selectively support L- and P-selectin but not E-selectin chimera binding. The presence of SGNL lipids on brain microvascular endothelium (and other endothelia) may implicate these molecules in leukocyte trafficking to the nervous system and elsewhere...|$|E

40|$|The {{subsurface}} behaviour of 99 Tc, a contaminant {{resulting from}} nuclear fuels reprocessing, {{is dependent on}} its valence (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>IV</b> or VII). Abiotic reduction of soluble Tc(VII) by Fe(II) (aq) in pH 6 – 8 solutions was investigated under strictly anoxic conditions using an oxygen trap (3 ̆c 7. 5 · 10 - 9 atm O 2). The reduction kinetics were strongly pH dependent. Complete and rapid reduction of Tc(VII) to a precipitated Fe/Tc(IV) form was observed when 11 µmol/L of Tc(VII) was reacted with 0. 4 mmol/L Fe(II) at pH 7. 0 and 8. 0, while no significant reduction was observed over 1 month at pH 6. 0. Experiments conducted at pH 7. 0 with Fe(II) (aq) = 0. 05 – 0. 8 mmol/L further revealed that Tc(VII) reduction {{was a combination of}} homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction. Heterogeneous reduction predominated after approximately 0. 01 mmol/L of Fe(II) was oxidized. The heterogeneous reaction was more rapid, and was catalyzed by Fe(II) that adsorbed to the Fe/Tc(IV) redox product. Wet chemical and Fe–X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy measurements (XANES) showed that Fe(II) and Fe(III) were present in the Fe/Tc(IV) redox products after reaction termination. 57 Fe-Mössbauer, extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements revealed that the Fe/Tc(IV) solid phase was poorly ordered and dominated by Fe(II) -containing ferrihydrite with minor magnetite. Tc(IV) exhibited homogeneous spatial distribution within the precipitates. According to Tc-EXAFS measurements and structural modeling, its molecular environment was consistent with an octahedral Tc(IV) dimer bound in bidentate edge-sharing mode to octahedral Fe(III) associated with surface or vacancy sites in ferrihydrite. The precipitate maintained Tc(IV) aq concentrations that were slightly below those in equilibrium with amorphous Tc(IV) O 2 •nH 2 O(s). The oxidation rate of sorbed Tc(IV) in the Fe/Tc precipitate was considerably slower than Tc(IV) O 2 •nH 2 O(s) {{as a result of its}} intraparticle/intragrain residence. Precipitates of this nature may form in anoxic sediments or ground waters, and the intraparticle residence of sorbed/precipitated Tc(IV) may limit 99 Tc remobilization upon the return of oxidizing conditions...|$|E
40|$|Background: Patients with {{multiple}} myeloma {{and other forms}} of cancer receiving pamidronate via intravenous (IV) infusion at the Hamilton Regional Cancer Centre in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada face 2 treatment options: they can have their entire treatment completed at the clinic using traditional IV therapy (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>IV</b> bag and pole) or they can have the treatment initiated at the clinic and then return home to complete the treatment utilising a portable and disposable IV therapy device. Objective: To perform a cost analysis of these 2 treatment options. Perspective: Societal. Methods and patients: Data on all patients {{with multiple}} myeloma who attended the Hamilton Regional Cancer Centre for pamidronate therapy from November 1, 1997 to October 31, 1998 were collected from clinic records. As almost all of these patients with multiple myeloma completed their IV therapy at home, comparison to clinic-based therapy was based on derived cost estimates. Cost data, where possible, were acquired from the Hamilton Regional Cancer Centre's records. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted. Results: In the base-case scenario for the study period, the incremental cost of the infusion device and training in Canadian dollars ($Can; 1998 values) for the 48 patients (299 cycles) who had their infusion initiated at the clinic but completed at home was $Can 15. 50 /cycle ($Can 4636 for the 299 cycles). If these 48 patients had had their entire infusion at the clinic, the incremental costs of overtime treatment, parking, clinic overheads and lost work or leisure time would have been $Can 68. 49 /cycle ($Can 20 477 for the 299 cycles). Therefore, shifting treatment from the clinic to the home resulted in net cost savings to society of $Can 52. 98 /cycle ($Can 15 841 for the 299 cycles). Sensitivity analysis of best- and worst-cost scenarios did not alter the substantive findings although the relative difference between treatment options varied. In the best-case scenario, home treatment was $Can 95. 97 /cycle ($Can 28 696 for the 299 cycles) less costly than clinic treatment, while in the worst-case scenario, home treatment was $Can 17. 19 /cycle ($Can 5141 for the 299 cycles) less costly than clinic treatment. The results also demonstrated that clinic overheads, the cost of a portable and disposable infusion device and the cost of lost work and leisure time had the greatest impact on incremental costs for each treatment option. Conclusion: Subject to study limitations, a significant cost advantage was demonstrated through the home-based treatment option for patients with multiple myeloma. Key issues that must be addressed in future evaluations include the precise determination of clinic overheads, the valuation of lost work and/or leisure time and the direct cost of portable and disposable infusion devices.

40|$|Fast-neutron-induced fission of 238 U at {{an energy}} {{just above the}} fission {{threshold}} is studied with a novel technique which involves the coupling of a high-efficiency γ-ray spectrometer (MINIBALL) to an inverse-kinematics neutron source (LICORNE) to extract charge yields of fission fragments via γ − γ coincidence spectroscopy. Experimental data and fission models are compared and found to be in reasonable agreement for many nuclei; however, significant discrepancies of up to 600 % are observed, particularly for isotopes of Sn and Mo. This indicates that these models significantly overestimate the standard 1 fission mode and suggests that spherical shell effects in the nascent fission fragments are less important for low-energy fast-neutron-induced fission than for thermal neutron-induced fission.

40|$|Coastal deltas {{are home}} for over 500 million people globally, {{and they have}} been {{identified}} {{as one of the most}} vulnerable coastal environments during the 21 st century. They are susceptible to multiple climatic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> sea-level rise, storm surges, change in temperature and precipitation) and socio-economic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> human-induced subsidence, population and urbanisation changes, GDP growth) drivers of change. These drivers also operate at multiple scales, ranging from local to global and short- to long-term. This highlights the complex challenges deltas face in terms of both their long-term sustainability as well as the well-being of their residents and the health of ecosystems that support the livelihood of large (often very poor) population under uncertain changing conditions. A holistic understanding of these challenges and the potential impacts of future climate and socio-economic changes is central for devising robust adaptation policies. Scenario analysis has long been identified as a strategic management tool to explore future climate change and its impacts for supporting robust decision-making under uncertainty. This research presents the overall scenario framework, methodology, and processes adopted for the development of scenarios in the DECCMA 1 project. DECCMA is analysing the future of three deltas in South Asia and West Africa: (i) the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) delta (Bangladesh/India), (ii) the Mahanadi delta (India), and (iii) the Volta delta (Ghana). This includes comparisons between these three deltas. Hence, the scenario framework comprises a multi-scale hybrid approach, with six levels of scenario considerations: (i) global (climate change, <b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> sea-level rise, temperature change; and socio-economic assumptions, <b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> population and urbanisation changes, GDP growth); (ii) regional catchments (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> change in river flow), (iii) regional seas (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> fisheries), (<b>iv)</b> regional politics (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> transboundary issues), (v) national (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> socio-economic factors), and (vi) delta-scale (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> future adaptation and migration policies) scenarios. The framework includes and combines expert-based and participatory approaches and provides improved specification of the role of scenarios to analyse the future state of adaptation and migration across the three deltas.

40|$|Epithelial {{synthesis}} and secretion of basal lamina {{has been}} {{considered to be a}} general feature of various vertebrate epithelium-mesenchyme interacting systems (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> salivary gland, mammary gland, feather, hair, and tooth morphogenesis). It has been repeatedly assumed that embryonic ectoderm and ectodermal derivatives, such as epithelial tissues associated with tooth morphogenesis, synthesize and secrete basal lamina. Basal lamina of embryonic mouse tooth organs contain laminin, type IV collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and possibly fibronectin. Ectodermally derived epithelia produce laminin, collagens, and glycosaminoglycans but they do not appear to produce fibronectin. Mesenchyme can effect basal lamina formation in vitro by releasing mesenchyme-derived fibronectin. Theiler stage 25 molar tooth mesenchymal and epithelial tissues were enzymatically separated and cultured in chemically defined media without serum, embryonic extracts, or antibiotics for periods not exceeding 24 hr. Isolated epithelia did not reconstitute a basal lamina. Mesenchymepreconditioned media, fibronectin substrata, or addition of 10 % fetal calf serum induced reconstitution of epithelium-derived basal lamina. Dental mesenchyme-preconditioned medium contained, as a major component, a protein of Mr ≈ 2. 3 × 105 identified as fibronectin by the criteria of gelatin binding and subunit molecular weight. Fibronectin was not produced by isolated epithelia.

These new observations effectively {{double the number of}} WLQs with spectroscopy in the optical rest-frame, and they allow us to compare the strengths of (weak) high-ionization emission lines (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> C <b>IV)</b> to low-ionization lines (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Mg II, Hβ, Hα) in individual objects. We detect broad Hβ and Hα emission in all objects, and these lines are generally toward the weaker end of the distribution expected for typical quasars (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Hβ has rest-frame equivalent widths ranging from 15 – 40 Å). However, these lowionization lines are not exceptionally weak, as is the case for high-ionization lines in WLQs. The X-shooter spectra also display relatively strong optical Fe II emission, Hβ FWHM  4000 km s− 1, and significant C IV blueshifts (≈ 1000 – 5500 km s− 1) relative to the systemic redshift; two spectra also show elevated UV Fe II emission, and an outflowing component to their (weak) Mg II emission lines. These properties suggest that WLQs are exotic versions of “wind-dominated” quasars. Their BELRs either have unusual high-ionization components, or their BELRs are in an atypical photoionization state because of an unusually soft continuum...|$|R
40|$|A solar {{eruption}} after a flare on 2011 June 7 produced EUV-bright {{impacts of}} fallbacks {{far from the}} eruption site, observed with the Solar Dynamics Observatory. These impacts can {{be taken as a}} template for the impact of stellar accretion flows. Broad redshifted UV lines have been commonly observed in young accreting stars. Here we study the emission from the impacts in the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly’s UV channels and compare the inferred velocity distribution to stellar observations. We model the impacts with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the localized UV 1600 Å emission and its timing with respect to the EUV emission {{can be explained by the}} impact of a cloud of fragments. The first impacts produce strong initial upflows. The following fragments are hit and shocked by these upflows. The UV emission comes mostly from the shocked front shell of the fragments while they are still falling, and is therefore redshifted when observed from above. The EUV emission instead continues from the hot surface layer that is fed by the impacts. Fragmented accretion can therefore explain broad redshifted UV lines (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> C <b>iv</b> 1550 Å) to speeds around 400 km s− 1 observed in accreting young stellar objects...|$|R
40|$|We present {{ultraviolet}} {{spectra of}} Mira's companion star from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument {{on board the}} Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The companion is generally {{assumed to be a}} white dwarf surrounded by an accretion disk fed by Mira's wind, which dominates the UV emission from the system. The STIS UV spectrum is dominated by numerous, narrow H 2 lines fluoresced by H I Ly-alpha, which were not detected in any of the numerous observations of Mira B by the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE). The high temperature lines detected by IUE (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> C <b>IV</b> 1550) still exist in the STIS spectrum but with dramatically lower fluxes. The continuum fluxes in the STIS spectra are also much lower, being more than an order of magnitude lower than ever observed by IUE, and also an order of magnitude lower than fluxes observed in more recent HST Faint Object Camera objective prism spectra from 1995. Thus, the accretion rate onto Mira B was apparently much lower when STIS observed the star, and this change altered the character of Mira B's UV spectrum.

40|$|Searching for a {{mechanism}} underlying autoimmunity in autism, we postulated that gliadin peptides, {{heat shock protein}} 60 (HSP- 60), and streptokinase (SK) bind to different peptidases resulting in autoantibody production against these components. We assessed this hypothesis in patients with autism and in those with mixed connective tissue diseases. Associated with antigliadin and anti-HSP antibodies, children with autism and patients with autoimmune disease developed anti-dipeptidylpeptidase I (DPP I), anti-dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV [or CD 26]) and anti-aminopeptidase N (CD 13) autoantibodies. A significant percentage of autoimmune and autistic sera were associated with elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, or IgA antibodies against three peptidases, gliadin, and HSP- 60. These antibodies are specific, since immune absorption dem-onstrated that only specific antigens (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> DPP <b>IV</b> absorption of anti-DPP IV), significantly reduced IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody levels. For direct demonstration of SK, HSP- 60, and gliadin peptide binding to DPP IV, microtiter wells coated with DPP IV were reacted with SK, HSP- 60, and gliadin. They were then reacted with anti-DPP IV or anti-SK, anti-HSP, and antigliadin antibodies. Adding SK, HSP- 60, and gliadin peptides to DPP IV resulted in 27 to 43 % inhibition of the DPP IV–anti-DPP IV reaction, but DPP IV-positive peptide...|$|R
40|$|Reverberation {{mapping of}} {{active galactic nucleus}} (AGN) emission-line regions {{requires}} the numerical deconvolution of two time series. We suggest {{the application of a}} new method, regularized linear inversion, to the solution of this problem. This method possesses many good features; it imposes no restrictions on the sign of the response function; it can provide clearly defined uncertainty estimates; it involves no guesswork about unmeasured data; it can give a clear indication of when the underlying convolution model is inadequate; and it is computationally very efficient. Using simulated data, we find the minimum S/N and length of the time series in order for this method to work satisfactorily. We also define guidelines for choosing the principal tunable parameter of the method and for interpreting the results. Finally, we reanalyze published data from the 1989 NGC 5548 campaign using this new method and compare the results to those previously obtained by maximum entropy analysis. For some lines we find good agreement, but for others, especially C III lambda(1909) and Si IV lambda(1400), we find significant differences. These {{can be attributed to the}} inability of the maximum entropy method to find negative values of the response function, but also illustrate the nonuniqueness of any deconvolution technique. We also find evidence that certain line light curves (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> C <b>IV</b> lambda(1549)) cannot be fully described by the simple linear convolution model...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{changes in}} the influence of family background, including socioeconomic and social background variables on educational attainment in Australia for cohorts born between 1890 and 1982. We test hypotheses from modernization theory on sibling data using random effects models and find: (i) substantial declines in the influence of family background on educational attainment (indicated by the sibling intraclass correlations); (ii) declines in the effects of both economic and cultural socioeconomic background variables; (iii) {{changes in the}} effects of some social background variables (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> family size); (<b>iv)</b> and declines in the extent that socioeconomic and social background factors account for variation in educational attainment. Unmeasured family background factors are more important, and proportionally increasingly so, for educational attainment than the measured socioeconomic and social background factors analyzed. Fixed effects models showed steeper declines in the effects of socioeconomic background variables than in standard analyses suggesting that unmeasured family factors associated with socioeconomic background obscure {{the full extent of}} the decline...|$|R
