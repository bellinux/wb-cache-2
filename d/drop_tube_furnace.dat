40|$|The {{increasing}} {{environmental concern}} {{caused by the}} use of fossil fuels and the concomitant need for improved combustion efficiency is leading to the development of new coal cleaning and utilisation processes. However, the benefits achieved by the removal of most mineral matter from coal either by physical or chemical methods can be annulled if poor coal combustibility characteristics are attained. In this work a high volatile bituminous coal with 6 % ash content was subjected to chemical demineralisation via hydrofluoric and nitric acid leaching, the ash content of the clean coal was reduced to 0. 3 %. The original and treated coals were devolatilised in a <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> <b>furnace</b> and the structure and morphology of the resultant chars was analysed by optical and scanning electron microscopies. The reactivity characteristics of the chars were studied by isothermal combustion tests in air at different temperatures in a thermogravimetric system. Comparison of the combustion behaviour and pollutant emissions of both coals was conducted in a <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> <b>furnace</b> operating at 1000 degrees C. The results of this work indicate that the char obtained from the chemically treated coal presents very different structure, morphology and reactivity behaviour than the char from the original coal. The changes induced by the chemical treatment increased the combustion efficiency determined in the <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> <b>furnace,</b> in fact higher burnout levels were obtained for the demineralised coal...|$|E

Chars generated in the PEFR show characteristics (e. g., morphology and internal structure) similar to those produced in a pressurized <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> <b>furnace</b> (PDTF) over the pressure range of 0. 5 - 1. 5 MPa but differ significantly from those of chars {{prepared in}} a DTF at atmospheric pressure. Consistent with previous work, high pressure favors {{the formation of a}} foam type of char structure while the number of both cenospheric and solid char particles decreases under pressurized conditions.

Seven different ranks of coals and coal blends of different mixing proportion were tested.

The ignition behaviours of the coals are established by combining the parameters. Results demonstrate that the parameters are suitable for distinguishing ignition behaviors from homogeneous, hetero-homogeneous to heterogeneous in the ignition section of a <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> <b>furnace.</b> The ignition behaviors of a coal blend are found to have similar characteristics as the coal of higher volatile matter in the blend and depend on its proportion in the blend.

The paper also presents predictions of an isothermal flow through the <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> <b>furnace.</b> In this study, a pdtf reactor operated at pressures up to 15 bar and at a temperature of 1, 173 K with particle heating rates of approximately 10 (5) K s(- 1) was used. The CFD model consists of two geometrical sections; flow straightner and injector. The single reaction and two competing reaction models were employed for this numerical investigation of the pyrolysis process.

40|$|The PCI {{technology}} {{is well established}} for reducing the consumption of economic and environmentally expensive coke in blast furnace iron-making. Often, coal blends show unexpected combustion performance which cannot be explained {{on the basis of}} individual coal properties particularly coal rank and volatile matter. Several coals were combusted in this study under controlled conditions in a <b>drop</b> <b>tube</b> <b>furnace.</b> Fixed bed reactor, XRD, SEM and BET analyses were used to understand the mechanism of combustion of coal blends. Burnout of the coal blends did not change linearly with volatile matter of blends. The study demonstrated that combustion behaviour of coal blends was influenced by several properties of individual coals and cannot be estimated by using any single coal parameter. Carbon structure of coal as well as the interaction of volatile matter of individual coals was found to have a strong influence on the burnout of coal blends. Pet-cokes were generally found to burn with a greater difficulty. Carbon structure of pet-cokes was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the burnout such that coal blends with highly ordered pet-coke indicated lower burnout. The study shows that up to 10 % of pet coke did not change the burnout of PCI blends significantly.
