25|$|Single-elimination {{style or}} {{knock-out}} style are also sometimes used for chess tournaments. In fact, {{the first international}} chess tournament was held in single-elimination style.

Players are normally given seeds based on their rating {{in order to prevent}} the highest ranked players from facing each other early in the competition. Double-elimination tournaments work {{in the same way as}} single-elimination tournaments except that a player loses eligibility to take first prize after two losses.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yet after all," [...] I said, [...] "even if we don't {{find the}} sphere at once, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> us. We might hold out. Even through the night. We might {{go down there}} again and make a fight for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>'s</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> Jane," [...] thought Polly, {{but had n't}} courage [...] "to {{speak out}} loud in meeting," [...] just then, and {{resolved}} to ask Trix for work, in private.|$|R
