40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. In {{the management of}} the U. S. Naval inventory, data quality is of critical importance. Errors in major inventory databases contribute to increased operational costs, reduced revenue, and loss of confidence in the reliability of the supply system. Maintaining error-free databases is not a realistic objective. Data-quality efforts must be prioritized to ensure that limited resources are allocated to achieve the maximum benefit. This thesis proposes a methodology to assist the Naval Inventory Control Point in the prioritization of its data-quality efforts. By linking data errors to Naval inventory performance metrics, statistical testing is used to identify errors that have the greatest adverse impact on <b>inventory</b> <b>operations.</b> By focusing remediation efforts on errors identified in this manner, the Navy can best use its limited resources devoted to improvement of data quality. Two inventory performance metrics are considered: Supply Material Availability (SMA), an established metric in Naval inventory management; and Backorder Persistence Metric (BPM), which is developed in the thesis. Backorder persistence measures the duration of time that the ratio of backorders to quarterly demand exceeds a threshold value. Both metrics can be used together to target remediation on reducing shortage costs and improving inventory system performance. Lieutenant Commander, Supply Corps, United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|We {{borrow the}} term 'static stochastic' from the {{classification}} of order crossover by Riezebos [2006, Inventory Order Crossovers. International Journal of Production Economics, 104 (2), p. 668]. The term 'static stochastic' refers to iid lead times, with its consequence of order crossovers. Here, we concern ourselves with iid continuous lead times with an infinite right tail, such as can be modeled by the normal and gamma distributions, where order crossover would be certain. We find that order crossover transforms the original lead times into a time series of receipts, whose mean {{is the same as}} that of the original lead time but whose variance is less than the original variance. The implication is that supply chain managers could exploit order crossover (say by frequent ordering) to reduce safety stocks. The reward is lower cost, albeit some administrative inconvenience. So our contribution attempts to shed more light on this type of order crossover and that order crossover is not necessarily baneful but actually helpful in reducing risk in <b>inventory</b> <b>operations.</b> A similar conclusion is provided by Riezebos and Gaalman [forthcoming.

40|$|The goal of {{this review}} is to present leading {{examples}} of current methodologies for extracting forest characteristics from full-waveform LiDAR data. Four key questions are addressed: (i) does full-waveform LiDAR provide advantages over discrete-return laser sensors; (ii) will full-waveform LiDAR provide valid results in support of forest <b>inventory</b> <b>operations</b> and allow for a decrease in ground sampling efforts; (iii) {{is the use of}} full-waveform LiDAR data cost effective; and (iv) what is the scope of the applied methods (i. e., is full-waveform LiDAR accurate for different forest compositions, structures, and densities, and is it sensitive to leaf-off/leaf-on conditions) ? Key forest structure characteristics can be estimated with significant accuracy using full-waveform metrics, although methodologies and their corresponding accuracies differ. For example, some processing methods are valid at the plot scale, whereas other procedures perform well at the regional scale; to be effective, certain LiDAR data analyses require a minimum point density, whereas other methods perform well using large-footprint sensors. Therefore, it is important to match processing methods with the appropriate scale and scope.

The difference between these two types of problems will be discussed in more detail below.

It will be suggested, further, that while much attention has been given to the tactical decision problem, the methods typically employed to solve the strategic problem are frequently less than satisfactory. Finally, an alternative approach to strategic decisions on <b>inventory</b> control <b>operations</b> will be outlined.

40|$|Purpose This {{research}} aims {{at exploring}} {{the effect of}} inventory record inaccuracy due to behavioral aspects of workers on the order and inventory variance amplification. Design/methodology/approach We adopt a continuous-time analytical approach to describe the effect of inbound throughput on the inventory and order variance amplification due to the workload pressure and arousal of workers. The model is numerically solved through simulation and results are analyzed with statistical general linear model. Findings Inventory management policies that usually dampen variance amplification are not effective when inaccuracy is generated due to workers’ behavioral aspects. Specifically, the psychological sensitivity and stability of workers {{to deal with a}} given range of operational conditions have a combined and multiplying effect over the amplification of order and inventory variance generated by her/his errors. Research limitations/implications The main limitation of our research is that we model workers’ behavior by inheriting a well-known theory from psychology that assumes a U-shaped relationship between stress and errors. We do not validate this relationship in the specific context of <b>inventory</b> <b>operations.</b> Practical implications The paper gives suggestions for managers who are responsible for designing order and inventory policies on how to take into account workers’ behavioral reaction to work pressure. Originality/value The logistics management literature does not lack of research works on behavioral decision making causes of order and inventory variance amplification. Contrarily, this paper investigates a new kind of behavioral issue, namely the impact of psycho-behavioral aspects of workers on variance amplification...|$|E
40|$|Smallholder and {{community}} interest in planting trees to supply essential {{products and services}} is high in areas where local forest resources have been harvested or access is limited. Smallholders are commercially focused hence the species of interest are often those with high market value {{so they can be}} used for local as well as commercial purposes. The market value of the trees from these woodlots will depend {{on the quality of the}} end-products, which in turn is dependent on woodlot management effects on tree growth and form. Inadequate establishment and silvicultural management of these woodlots is widespread and leads to low quality trees and low yields. The effect is two-fold, namely a reduction in the products available for local use and sale, and diminished interest in continuing tree planting. Many of the practical issues of woodlot management can be addressed through targeted extension, although in PNG and many other developing countries extension services are severely limited. This paper reports a study of the use of a participatory approach to extension by engaging with lead smallholder farmers, becoming known locally as enumerators. The approach included targeted training and participatory demonstration plantings, but also smallholder engagement in <b>inventory</b> <b>operations.</b> The engagement in inventory activities was seen to provide the enumerators with insight into the outcomes of various woodlot management approaches. This paper explores the variation in effectiveness of enumerators to perform inventory activities, the utility of the inventory data to quantify woodlot performance, and the effect of the participatory inventory approach on enumerators' understanding of the outcomes of management methods and their capacity to play an informal extension role within their communities...|$|E
40|$|It is {{critically}} important for inventory-carrying facilities to provide high availability of products at the minimal operating cost. To achieve this objective, many companies have automated their <b>inventory</b> <b>operations</b> and rely on the information system in critical decision makings. However, if the information is inaccurate, it may lead to high out-of-stocks and/or excess inventory. This thesis examines what the primary causes of the inaccuracy are, how {{and to what extent}} they degrade the inventory system performance, {{and what can be done}} to compensate for the inaccuracy. Analytical and simulation modelling demonstrate that the inventory system performance is highly sensitive to the inaccuracy caused by stock loss, which is the disappearance of items (such as due to theft) not detected by the information system. That is, even a small level of stock loss accumulated over time can lead to inventory inaccuracy that disrupts the replenishment process and creates severe out-of-stocks. In fact, revenue losses due to out-of-stocks can far outweigh the property losses due to the disappearing items. (cont.) One way to deal with the inaccuracy problem is the use of RFID-based automatic product identification technology under development at the Auto-ID Center, which can provide the real-time and accurate information regarding the location and quantity of objects in supply chain. It is found that even when this technology provides imperfect measurement of the stock quantity, dramatic performance improvement can be achieved using an inventory control scheme based on dynamic programming. Various other methods of compensating for the inventory inaccuracy are presented and evaluated. Analysis of each method reveals that the inventory inaccuracy problem can be effectively treated even without automatic identification technology in some situations. However, each method has weaknesses. by Yun Kang. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2004.

Doorco’s market consists of 95 percent housing development projects, which include supplying some of the larger construction companies with kitchen and built-in cupboards. In recent years, Doorco experienced rapid company growth together with facing other industry unique challenges that created a decrease in productivity. The manual business system currently used at Doorco is inefficient and wastes a lot of time. The storage system is inefficient and the control of inventory is ineffective. The aim of this project is to increase productivity at Doorco by improving the business system, storage system and <b>inventory</b> <b>operations.</b> A computerised business system had to be designed, which would decrease the time taken to complete important business functions. A new storage system also had to be designed, including an improved layout of the storeroom, which should specify the exact locations of all SKUs (Stock-Keeping Units). Such a system would improve productivity by reducing the time spent searching for parts. An inventory system also had to be designed which would specify the amount and re-supply intervals of all SKUs and such a system would improve productivity by reducing the probability of shortages or oversupply, while also saving space in the storage area. Inventory cost will also be minimized by such a system. Literature was gathered to aid in the understanding of the problems and relevant techniques that could aid in the problem solving process. Solutions to these problems were developed and presented to the owner of Doorco. The storage system and inventory system were implemented, but the decision of implementation of the computerised business system solution was left to the owner. Dissertation (B. Eng.

Making correct {{decision}} in forest management {{is based on}} the quality of the collected information. Collection information from forests is the main task of the forest inventory. Due to the rapid development of technology, in the second half of the 20 th century, there have been major changes in the way of data collection, particularly in developed countries. In addition to conventional terrestrial methods of data collection, data on forests is increasingly being collected with remote sensing methods. Using remote sensing methods leads to reducing the scope of the fieldwork, and opens the possibility of saving time and money. In this paper was given the review of previous research and results of application of remote sensing methods in Croatian forest inventory. Previous researches presented in this paper will give insight into the current status and role of remote sensing in Croatian forest inventory, and along with some new findings may serve as guidelines for future research and application of new methods of remote sensing in forest inventory. Various researches about applicability of remote sensing methods in forest <b>inventory</b> <b>operations,</b> primarily on aerial photographs and more recently on satellite images, were conducted in Croatia in the last 30 and more years. In all previous studies of forest damage assessments with photointerpretation on CIR aerial photographs it was proved that this method is to be equally in comparison with terrestrial methods regarding to accuracy, and much more efficient regarding to achieved speed and objectivity. Methodology suitable for operational use in inventory of forest damage was made. Periodic inventories of forest health with using remote sensing methods enable easy monitoring of changes of forest between two inventories, identification of new foci of dying trees or other damage, which is especially important in today’s changed and altered environmental conditions. Forest management inventory requires information of greater accuracy. Therefore, aerial photographs of higher spatial resolution have more important applications in relation to satellite imagery in forest management inventory. Some researches of using aerial photographs for photogrammetric measurements of stands parameters shown in this paper gave good results. Despite the above, the application of remote sensing methods in practical forest inventory has not been sufficiently utilized.

40|$|Logistics {{constitute}} an important activity for organisations dealing with physical goods. The majority {{of research in}} transport logistics however, has been in land-based transportation. In comparison, maritime logistics has received little attention even though ship fleets require greater capital investments and operating expenditures. Futhermore, {{the overwhelming majority of}} goods by volume, is carried by sea. In maritime logistics, container shipping has received the greater part of the research attention while the shipping of bulk products such as grain, ore and liquids has remained relatively unexplored. This research explores two important aspects of bulk shipping. The first part involves the development of a model for the determination of the optimal routing, schedule and loading plan for a fleet of ships carrying bulk products. A mixed-integer linear programming formulation is developed to determine routes, departure-arrival times and quantities to be loaded or unloaded for a fleet of heterogeneous ships carrying multiple products between harbours. Some harbours are production points for particular products while others are consumption points. Essentially the problem is to determine the route, timing and quantities that minimise the transportation cost such that the inventory levels at harbours, affected by consumption and production, are maintained within storage capacities. The problem is complicated by multiple-berth harbours which require the formulation to be extended so that inventory levels are correctly tracked when multiple ships concurrently load or unload products at a harbour. Secondly, the developed formulation allows flexible use of onboard compartments, removing the need to dedicate compartments to specific products. Third, an extension to the formulation allows a harbour to serve as a redistribution point to other harbours even though it is primarily a consumption point. This makes it possible to send large loads to a redistribution harbour and then send smaller loads to nearby harbours. Fourth, an extension is developed to allow individual loading and unloading rates to be specified for each ship–harbour pair. Formulations in literature assume a constant rate but real-world rates are determined by the performance of onshore and onboard loading equipment. The formulation seeks to minimise the total transport operating cost within the planning horizon including fuel and port charges, loading /unloading costs and other fees. In addition, the formulation is able to take into account costs associated with ships that are chartered instead of owned by the operator. Variations of the formulation are used in solving nine different configurations. Results demonstrate that the routing, timing and inventories are accurate. Further, the flexible-use compartment and redistribution harbour extensions are shown to provide substantial improvements in transportation costs and lead to better utilisation of onboard compartments. The formulation provides optimal decisions for integrated routing and <b>inventory</b> <b>operations,</b> leading to better use of transport assets and storage facilities. While {{the first part of the}} research looks at the overall planning of the distribution system, the second part focuses specifically on the ship queuing problem just prior to berthing and. This is motivated by the long ship queue and waiting time, leading to demurrage costs in the millions of dollars experienced at several coal export terminals in Australia. The purpose of this research is to explore alternative priority rules for routing ships to the berths from a queue outside the terminals. At present, ships are routed by turn of arrival. A discrete-event model is developed to represent a section of the coal supply chain leading up to the loading operation at the terminals as well as ship arrival and queuing. The model takes into account stochastic features of the operation as well as maintenance, breakdown and delays. A case study for two coal export terminals is presented and the performance of alternative priority rules at varying demand requirements is explored. Results indicate that any of the alternative priority rules tested performs substantially better than the existing priority rule in terms of the waiting time profile, ability to absorb higher throughput requirements and berth utilisation. These alternative rules provide a promising solution to an especially costly problem...|$|E
