40|$|Brined Feta and Domiati type cheeses were {{produced}} from whole goat´s milk. Different types of production were used; {{with and without}} goat´s milk acidification with citric acid. The effect of calcium chloride addition was also examined. Renneting of goat´s milk with 0. 03 % renilase was conducted at 40 °C for Domiati type cheese and at 30 °C for <b>Feta</b> type <b>cheese.</b> Additives (citric acid and calcium chloride) presence {{had no effect on}} reneting time for <b>Feta</b> type <b>cheeses</b> while citric acid addition significantly reduced reneting time for Domiati type cheeses. Domiati type cheeses possessed softer consistency, lower acidity, lower protein and fat content than <b>Feta</b> type <b>cheeses.</b> The yield of Domiati type cheeses was approximately 18. 37 % higher than of <b>Feta</b> type <b>cheeses.</b> Ripening of both types of cheeses was conducted in the brine with 10 % sodium chloride at 12 °C for 14 days. All cheese samples had lower protein, fat and calcium content in comparison with quality of cheeses before ripening in a brine. This especially occurred in <b>Feta</b> type <b>cheeses.</b> Sensory evaluation of analysed type of cheese was determined at 7 th and 14 th day of ripening. Better sensory scores are obtained for both types of cheeses after 14 days of ripening, when flavour and taste improvements were significantly higher. The best scores were obtained for Domiati cheese samples from unacidified goat´s milk, regardles of calcium chloride addition...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of adjunct brine cultures on the volatile compounds in Feta-type cheeses made from bovine milk was studied. Four batches of brine were produced: one with no added adjuncts, a second containing Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, a third containing Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei plus Debaryomyces hansenii {{and a fourth}} with Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei plus Yarrowia lipolytica. All the cultures were isolated from commercial Feta brines. Aroma compounds were analysed by dynamic headspace analysis, on-line coupled with GC/MS. The most important volatile compounds were quantified in the experimental cheeses; {{it was concluded that}} the use of Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei and D. hansenii as adjuncts in the manufacture of Feta-type cheeses contribute to the formation of a richer pattern of aroma compounds, namely alcohols, aldehydes and esters. The inclusion of Y. lipolytica resulted in the production of undesirable aroma compounds that {{are not part of the}} usual volatile profile of high quality <b>Feta</b> <b>cheeses.</b> (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

2500|$|Fariña {{is known}} for his novel, Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me, {{originally}} published by Random House in 1966.

40|$|Eleven {{essential}} oils (EOs) were evaluated for their antibacterial properties, against Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) and E. coli O 157 :H 7. EOs were introduced into Brain Heart Infusion agar (BHI) (15 ml) at {{a concentration of}} 0. 25 to 2 % (vol/vol) to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) for each pathogen evaluated. Results showed that the most active {{essential oils}} against bacteria tested were thyme oil, with MIC 90 and MBC 90 for the VRA strains of 0. 25 % and 0. 5 %, respectively. Eucalyptus, juniper and clove oils were the least potent agent, with MIC 90 and MBC 90 of 2 %. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of these EO were evaluated against VRE and E. coli O 157 :H 7, experimentally inoculated (10 ³ cfu/g) in <b>Feta</b> soft <b>cheese</b> and minced beef meat, which was mixed with different concentrations (0. 1 %, 0. 5 % and 1 %) of the EO and stored at 7 ºC for 14 days. Out of eucalyptus, juniper, mint, rosemary, sage, clove and thyme oils tested against target bacteria sage and thyme showed the best results. Clove and mint did not show any effect on VRE and E. coli O 157 :H 7 in both kinds of studied foods. The addition of thyme oil at concentrations of 0. 5 and 1 % caused best significant reduction in {{the growth rate of}} VRE and E. coli O 157 :H 7 in cheese and meat at 7 ºC. It is concluded that selected plant EOs can act as potent inhibitors of both microorganisms in a food product.
