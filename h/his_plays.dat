5|$|Gilbert was knighted on 15 July 1907 in {{recognition}} of his contributions to drama. Sullivan had been knighted for his contributions to music {{almost a quarter of}} a century earlier, in 1883. Gilbert was, however, the first British writer ever to receive a knighthood for <b>his</b> <b>plays</b> alone—earlier dramatist knights, such as Sir William Davenant and Sir John Vanbrugh, were knighted for political and other services.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden had an on-again off-again {{relationship}} with Zionism. Some of his earliest poetry was Zionist avant la lettre {{and one of}} his last plays was written in Hebrew; several of <b>his</b> <b>plays</b> were implicitly or explicitly Zionist (Shulamith set in Jerusalem, Mashiach Tzeiten?! ending with its protagonists abandoning New York for Palestine); he served as a delegate from Paris to the World Zionist Congress in 1900. Still, {{he spent most of his}} life (and set slightly more than half of <b>his</b> <b>plays)</b> in the Pale of Settlement and in the adjoining Jewish areas in Romania, and when he left it was never to go to Palestine, but to cities such as New York, London or Paris. This might be understandable when the number of his potential Jewish spectators in Palestine in his time was very small.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds {{became a}} {{successful}} oil businessman after <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career. He began investing in oil wells during <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career.|$|R
50|$|Pavićević {{has spent}} most of <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career in <b>his</b> native Bar <b>playing</b> for the local team Mornar. On two {{occasions}} he played for Budućnost in Podgorica, and he ended <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career in Omonia Nicosia.|$|R
50|$|Sanders is {{the creator}} and {{producer}} of F*ckplays at the Ohio Theatre and Galapagos Art Space, featuring <b>his</b> <b>play</b> 1.1-1.7 (dir. Stephen Brackett); Dread Awakening at the 45th Street Theatre, featuring <b>his</b> <b>play</b> Sleep Mask (dir. Amanda Charlton); and ‘‘Deweys Nightmare: The Library Play Challenge at the Gene Frankel Theatre, featuring <b>his</b> <b>play</b> Mangina (dir. Kerry Whigham).|$|R
5|$|In the 20th and 21st centuries, {{his works}} have been {{repeatedly}} adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. <b>His</b> <b>plays</b> remain highly popular and are constantly studied, performed and reinterpreted in diverse {{cultural and political}} contexts throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|Matters were {{complicated}} by mass illnesses spreading across London; the epidemic, probably flu, {{reduced the number}} of actors able to work and many plays were cancelled. Even Henry Fielding's play The Miser, which was to open early January, was postponed because of the poor health of its cast members, including Theophilus. The Miser was eventually staged in mid February and was successful, but another of <b>his</b> <b>plays,</b> Deborah: or, a Wife for You All, lasted only one night on 6 April 1733. Regardless of the problems plaguing the season, it was positive for Fielding while it lasted, with six of <b>his</b> <b>plays</b> being produced on stage along with Thomas Arne's The Opera of Operas, Fielding's Tom Thumb set to music.|$|E
5|$|Shaw {{published}} a collected edition of <b>his</b> <b>plays</b> in 1934, comprising forty-two works. He wrote a further twelve {{in the remaining}} sixteen years of his life, mostly one-act pieces. Including eight earlier plays that he chose to omit from his published works, the total is sixty-two.|$|E
50|$|Canning started {{coaching}} Hamilton's under-17 team, {{while continuing}} <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career, in the 2012-13 season. He signed a new one-year contract with Hamilton in May 2013. Canning maintained <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> registration after being appointed Hamilton manager in 2015. Despite only making three first team {{appearances in the}} 2015-16 season due to injury, Canning extended <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> contract by another year in May 2016.|$|R
50|$|Raúl Hernández Garrido (born 1964) is a Spanish playwright. He won the Calderon de la Barca Prize in 1994 for <b>his</b> <b>play</b> Los Malditos ('The Damned Ones'); the Lope de Vega Prize in 1997 for <b>his</b> <b>play</b> Los engranajes ('The Gears') and the Born Theatre Prize in 2000 for <b>his</b> <b>play</b> Si un dia me olvidaras ('When you'll forget me').|$|R
50|$|In <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> days, Gastien played {{predominantly}} as {{a central}} defensive-midfielder. The majority of <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career was spent in the top two divisions of the French football league system.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the century, some of {{the most}} widely read Russian {{literary}} figures focused on feminist motifs in their works. In his later years, Leo Tolstoy argued against the traditional institution of marriage, comparing it to forced prostitution and slavery, a theme that he also touched on in his novel Anna Karenina. In <b>his</b> <b>plays</b> and short stories, Anton Chekhov portrayed a variety of working female protagonists, from actresses to governesses, who sacrificed social esteem and affluence for the sake of financial and personal independence; in spite of this sacrifice, these women are among the few Chekhovian characters who are truly satisfied with their lives.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden wandered Europe as a {{poet and}} journalist. <b>His</b> <b>plays</b> {{continued}} to be performed in Europe and America, but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma and spitting up blood – and he {{was running out of}} money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head once more to New York in 1904.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>plays</b> {{and songs}} {{achieved}} new {{popularity in the}} 1960s and 1970s, and his work and style continue to influence popular culture. Coward did not publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, but it was discussed candidly after his death by biographers including Graham Payn, his long-time partner, and in Coward's diaries and letters, published posthumously. The former Albery Theatre (originally the New Theatre) in London was renamed the Noël Coward Theatre in his honour in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Love in Several Masques was Fielding's first play, and {{was first}} {{released}} on 16 February 1728. Though {{the play was}} never revived and only ran for four nights, it still did moderately well especially {{when compared with the}} competing plays at that time. In the play, three respectable males each meet a female counterpart three times, and share a parallel incident with letters and an unmasking. Fielding focuses on men and how he believes they should prove their worth before marriage. It also highlights Fielding's belief in the relationship of morality and libertine beliefs and introduces character types that Fielding would use throughout <b>his</b> <b>plays</b> and novels.|$|E
5|$|Love's Last Shift {{is today}} read mainly {{to gain a}} {{perspective}} on Vanbrugh's sequel The Relapse, which has by contrast remained a stage favourite. Modern scholars often endorse the criticism that was levelled at Love's Last Shift from the first, namely {{that it is a}} blatantly commercial combination of sex scenes and drawn-out sentimental reconciliations. Cibber's follow-up comedy Woman's Wit (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had no discernible theme; Cibber, not usually shy about any of <b>his</b> <b>plays,</b> even elided its name in the Apology. It was followed by the equally unsuccessful tragedy Xerxes (1699). Cibber reused parts of Woman's Wit for The School Boy (1702).|$|E
5|$|Maxwell Zachs is a writer, Judaic studies scholar, and trans activist. Since 2011 he {{has written}} for various {{publications}} on subjects pertaining to gender and Judaism. In 2012, he started a petition calling on the WHO to delist transsexualism from the International Classification of Diseases. After a period of charity work, he moved to Stockholm to study at Paideia, the European Institute for Jewish Studies in Sweden, on a one-year fellowship. In 2013, while living in Stockholm, he published some of <b>his</b> <b>plays,</b> {{as well as a}} dystopian novella called The People's Republic of Nowhere.|$|E
50|$|Streltsov {{started out}} <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career in 1961 in FC Alga Bishkek. He retired in 1975 with FC Spartak Ivano-Frankivsk. During <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career Streltsov also {{played for the}} {{football}} team of Kyrgyz SSR.|$|R
50|$|His {{scriptwriting}} {{includes the}} short film Hard Hat. He was Writer-in-Residence with the Half Moon Theatre and <b>his</b> <b>play</b> Cued Up toured the UK. <b>His</b> <b>play</b> Coasting was a showcased {{winner in the}} International Playwrighting Festival.|$|R
50|$|Magrão {{played for}} several clubs in Brazil during <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career. He {{also had a}} brief spell in the Spanish Segunda División with CD Badajoz. He {{finished}} <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career with J. League side Gamba Osaka.|$|R
5|$|More sportingly, the 5th century BC tragedian Euripides often {{played with}} the old traditions, mocking them, and through the voice of his {{characters}} injecting notes of doubt. Yet the subjects of <b>his</b> <b>plays</b> were taken, without exception, from myth. Many of these plays were written in answer to a predecessor's {{version of the same}} or similar myth. Euripides mainly impugns the myths about the gods and begins his critique with an objection similar to the one previously expressed by Xenocrates: the gods, as traditionally represented, are far too crassly anthropomorphic.|$|E
5|$|Reading and how reading defines {{characters}} is a focus within many {{plays and}} in Fielding's later works. In Love in Several Masques, the character Wisemore focuses on classics but ignores contemporary society. Similarly, the character Wilding, in The Temple Beau, practices law but doesn't read at all. Reading is an outlet to understanding humanity, and Fielding uses <b>his</b> <b>plays</b> to inform an audience how {{to better understand}} humanity.|$|E
5|$|The letter proved prophetic of Chekhov's marital {{arrangements}} with Olga: he lived largely at Yalta, she in Moscow, pursuing her acting career. In 1902, Olga suffered a miscarriage; and Donald Rayfield has offered evidence, {{based on the}} couple's letters, that conception may have occurred when Chekhov and Olga were apart, although Russian scholars have rejected that claim. The literary legacy of this long-distance marriage is a correspondence that preserves gems of theatre history, including shared complaints about Stanislavski's directing methods and Chekhov's advice to Olga about performing in <b>his</b> <b>plays.</b>|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career, he was a player-manager for FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the 1998-99 season. After the end of <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career, {{he managed}} SV Straelen from 1 October 2002 to 30 June 2003.|$|R

50|$|During <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career, {{he played}} as a goalkeeper for various Dutch clubs, {{including}} Excelsior, PSV, Heracles Almelo, SC Heerenveen, SC Cambuur, Telstar and Feyenoord. Following <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career {{he became the}} goalkeeping coach for Feyenoord, Excelsior and then Ajax.|$|R
5|$|The play's {{original}} Broadway production {{opened at}} the Empire Theatre on 22 April 1895, but closed after sixteen performances. Its cast included William Faversham as Algy, Henry Miller as Jack, Viola Allen as Gwendolen, and Ida Vernon as Lady Bracknell. The Australian premiere was in Melbourne on 10 August 1895, presented by Dion Boucicault, Jr. and Robert Brough, and the play was an immediate success. Wilde's downfall in England {{did not affect the}} popularity of <b>his</b> <b>plays</b> in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} William Shakespeare enjoyed a renewed {{popularity}} in 18th-century Britain. Several new editions {{of his works}} were published, <b>his</b> <b>plays</b> were revived in the theatre and numerous works of art were created illustrating the plays and specific productions of them. Capitalising on this interest, Boydell decided to publish a grand illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays that would showcase the talents of British painters and engravers. He chose the noted scholar and Shakespeare editor George Steevens to oversee the edition, which was released between 1791 and 1803.|$|E
5|$|Time is also {{connected}} {{to the theme of}} light and dark. In Shakespeare's day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the afternoon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to create the illusion of day and night in <b>his</b> <b>plays.</b> Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to the illusion of its passage.|$|E
50|$|Ankahee, a Hindi {{film was}} made on <b>his</b> <b>play</b> Kalay Tasmai Namaha in 1985 by Amol Palekar {{featuring}} Amol Palekar and Deepti Naval. Vijaya Mehta's production of <b>his</b> <b>play,</b> Ek Shoonya Bajirao is considered as a landmark in contemporary Indian theatre.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, Doc Cheatham made a {{vigorous}} self-assessment to improve <b>his</b> <b>playing,</b> including taping himself and critically {{listening to the}} recordings, then endeavoring to eliminate all clichés from <b>his</b> <b>playing.</b> The discipline paid off, and Doc received ever-improving critical attention.|$|R
50|$|Kontos began <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> {{career with}} Ionikos NF. With Panathinaikos Athens, he won 9 Greek League championships (1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1980, 1981, 1982) and 3 Greek Cups (1979, 1982, 1983). He {{finished}} <b>his</b> <b>playing</b> career with AEK Athens.|$|R
