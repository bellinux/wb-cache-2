The present study investigated how this voice effect {{is affected by the}} consistency over time rule, which dictates that, once people <b>expect</b> a certain <b>procedure,</b> deviation from the <b>expected</b> <b>procedure</b> will lead to a reduction in procedural fairness. Two experiments were conducted.

The manipulations were induced by means of scenarios in Experiment 1, and by means of the Lind, Kanfer and Early (1990) paradigm in Experiment 2. In both experiments it was found that subjects who <b>expected</b> a voice <b>procedure</b> or who <b>expected</b> nothing judged receiving the voice procedure as more fair than receiving the no-voice procedure, but that subjects who <b>expected</b> a no-voice <b>procedure</b> judged receiving the voice procedure (inconsistency) as less fair than receiving the no-voice procedure (consistency).

This “paired approach” operational concept pairs two aircraft, with the trail aircraft of the pair remaining within a safe zone calculated to be free (for a specified period of time) from collision danger and wake turbulence interactions. Enabling this operation would reduce dependent spacing between aircraft landing on closely spaced parallel runways in poor weather conditions, which is {{a significant source of}} weather-r lated delays.

40|$|It is an {{academic}} truism that enlargement affected {{the functioning of}} the European Union and its institutions, and that effects of enlargement are especially noticeable in the Council and its sub-structures. Many researchers <b>expected</b> <b>procedures</b> in the Council to become more intergovernmental and decision-making to become more complicated. However, enlargement also contributed to institutional change in the Committee of Permanent Representatives in quite another—unexpected—way: it strengthened the influence of supranational and “quasi-supranational” actors within the Council, such as the Commission, the Presidency and the General Secretariat, and it made decision-making considerably easier in cases where profound national interests of the newcomers were not directly concerned. Four institutional mechanisms can be identified that contributed to this unexpected institutional evolution: The mechanism of socialization, the mechanism of specific and unspecific reciprocity, the mechanism of lack of interest and the mechanism of presidential impartiality. These mechanisms helped to overcome the cleavage between old and new as well as to uphold the strong and often cited esprit de corps within the Council and its preparatory bodies. The paper analyzes these processes and tries to answer the question: how did these mechanisms contribute to a kind of supranationalization of the Council and its substructures after the last rounds of enlargement? The analysis is based on 51 semi-structured, intensive interviews with experts from the Council General Secretariat and from member states’ Permanent Representations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for real-time egocentric activity recognition in which component atomic events are characterised in terms of binary relationships between {{parts of the body}} and manipulated objects. The key contribution is to summarise, within a histogram, the relationships that hold over a fixed time interval. This histogram is then classified into {{one of a number of}} atomic events. The relationships encode both the types of body parts and objects involved (e. g. wrist, hammer) together with a quantised representation of their distance apart and the normalised rate of change in this distance. The quantisation and classifier are both configured in a prior learning phase from training data. An activity is represented by a Markov model over atomic events. We show the application of the method in the prediction of the next atomic event within a manual procedure (e. g. assembling a simple device) and the detection of deviations from an <b>expected</b> <b>procedure.</b> This could be used for example in training operators in the use or servicing of a piece of equipment, or the assembly of a device from components. We evaluate our approach (’Bag-of-Relations’) on two datasets: ‘labelling and packaging bottles’ and ‘hammering nails and driving screws’, and show superior performance to existing Bag-of-Features methods that work with histograms derived from image features [1].

40|$|Background: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{demonstrate}} the added value of routine transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for correctly positioning the transseptal system in the fossa ovalis (FO), thus potentially preventing complications during fluoroscopy-guided transseptal puncture (TP), and for assessing the optimal puncture site within the FO according to the <b>expected</b> <b>procedure</b> type. Methods: Ninety-one patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedures by cryoballoon technique for drug-resistant paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) were prospectively included. In 57 patients, the TP procedure was performed under fluoroscopic guidance and septal localization was confirmed by contrast injection through the needle and demonstration of septal tenting in both the anteroposterior and left lateral fluoroscopic projections. In 34 patients, TP was performed under TEE guidance and positioning was targeted to perform the TP procedure in the more anterior and inferior locations of the FO. Two patient groups were compared according to the incidence of complications directly attributable to transseptal catheterization, thromboembolic complications, recurrence rates after the ablation procedure, total procedural time, and fluoroscopy time. Results: Fluoroscopy time (p< 0. 001), total cryoablation time (p= 0. 002), and total procedural time (p< 0. 001) were shorter in the TEE-guided group. Left inferior pulmonary vein (LIPV) cryoablation time (p= 0. 007) and right inferior pulmonary vein (RIPV) cryoablation time (p= 0. 004) were significantly shorter {{and the number of}} applications to the LIPV (p= 0. 007) and RIPV (p= 0. 005) were significantly fewer in the TEE-guided group.

40|$|In this work, {{a common}} refined design method is {{evaluated}} {{with respect to a}} recently constructed bridge. Two finite element models of the Wakota Bridge in South St. Paul, Minnesota, were produced, one using a design level program (SAP 2000) and the other using a research level program (ABAQUS). These models were verified with respect to each other using linearly elastic materials and were found to behave similarly. After this verification, an arbitrary temperature load was applied to each model and the refined design method was evaluated for accuracy of reduced section properties with respect to the more descriptive progressive cracking solution simulated by ABAQUS. The refined design method was employed using two, four, and six stiffness segments at which stiffness is evaluated along the height of the pier walls. It was seen that accuracy increased as the number of stiffness segments increased and that four segments seemed to balance accuracy and time-commitment by the engineer adequately. A staged construction model of the Wakota Bridge was also built, using the design level program, which incorporates all time-dependent effects of the construction sequence as well as locked-in forces. A pile analysis was performed and appropriate rotational springs were found for Foundations 2 and 3. A simplified method for the determination of the rotational springs is discussed, and a range of effective lengths was found for use with this procedure. The staged construction model is used for field data correlation in Part two of this report. The staged construction model was also used to evaluate the different design options as described in the AASHTO LRFD. The two options given for accounting for reduced section properties were evaluated and compared. The refined analysis option and gross section option were compared for the Wakota Bridge and are shown to correlate to within about 10 %.

40|$|The {{potential}} benefits of appraisal as a mechanism for improving performance {{are more likely to}} come to fruition if there is commitment from teachers’ that goes beyond mere compliance. This thesis set out to explore teachers’ attitudes to understand how factors within appraisal affected their level of commitment to the process. The literature review focused on the impact of appraisal on teachers and their learning within the New Zealand context. The concepts of trust and motivation were explored because of their importance to adult learning. The discussion included a review of current tensions within appraisal, such as teacher professionalism and the multiple purposes of appraisal. The research adopted a qualitative methodology involving the case studies of two private schools, to gain an in depth understanding of the contextual influences on teachers’ attitudes. Information was gathered over three stages and involved multiple methods of data collection and analysis with a predominantly qualitative weighting. Stage one involved searching policy and procedural documents to gain an understanding of the intent of appraisal, and <b>expected</b> <b>procedures.</b> Stage two used a questionnaire to gather attitudes of the whole staff. Stage three involved focus group discussions to explore the reasons behind attitudes. Tensions that evolved from the findings were related to assessment, ownership, qualities of the appraisal relationship, time, and trust. The research found that attitudes associated with the effectiveness of appraisal were closely aligned to the tensions between the multiple purposes of appraisal on the one hand, and ownership on the other. Existing workloads did {{have a significant impact on}} teachers’ level of commitment to the process. There was overwhelming evidence that teachers found little value in appraisal as it was currently practised. The recommendations that come from this research are that school leaders should consider how the identified tensions in purpose might be alleviated, and how teachers’ workload issues could be addressed. For appraisal to be effective, it needs to be positioned to capture a teacher’s inherent desire to improve their practice and do their best for the students they teach. Further research could increase understanding of the most significant factors that give ownership, and features of the appraisal relationship, that will contribute to the effectiveness of appraisal...|$|R
