40|$|SummaryWe {{evaluated}} an endobronchial <b>valve</b> <b>device</b> in {{the treatment}} of surgically created air leak or pneumothorax by eliminating antegrade flow. MethodsSix sheep underwent general anesthesia with positive pressure ventilation and left thoracotomy. After division of the mediastinal pleura, the contralateral cranial lobe was identified and a 2. 5 cm× 1. 5 cm laceration created with resultant air leak. Using bronchoscopy, we deployed a <b>valve</b> <b>device</b> in the bronchus of the injured segment. Chest drainage tube was placed and the thoracotomy closed. At 1 week (n= 3) and 4 weeks (n= 3), the animals underwent general anesthesia, bronchoscopy and right thoracotomy. ResultsAll animals survived the procedure. Bronchoscopic <b>valve</b> <b>device</b> placement in the segmental bronchus resolved the air leak immediately. After closure of thoracotomy, the chest tube demonstrated minimal drainage with no air leak. At 1 and 4 weeks, bronchoscopy showed no change in device location, and the treated segments were atelectatic with fibrous scar at the injured site. ConclusionsCollapse of a selected lung segment with resolution of air leak can be achieved using bronchoscopically implanted <b>valve</b> <b>device.</b> The <b>valve</b> <b>device</b> may facilitate treatment of patients with post-surgical or post-traumatic persistent air leak...|$|R
40|$|We have {{fabricated}} a microfluidic gel <b>valve</b> <b>device</b> {{that used}} reversible sol-gel transition of methyl cellulose (MC). A microheater and a microtemperature sensor were implemented in each microchannel in the gel <b>valve</b> <b>device.</b> Before evaluating {{the performance of}} the gel <b>valve</b> <b>device,</b> various properties of the MC solution were investigated using viscometer, spectrophotometer, and NMR. Gelation temperature was increased as the MC concentration was increased. Clear gel, an intermediate state between clear sol and turbid gel, was found at the temperature range from 30 - 40 °C to 50 - 60 °C. Temperature at each microchannel of the device was measured and the effect of the temperature difference on the valve operation was elucidated. In order to have normal operation of the gel valve, it was important to keep the temperature of the heated microchannel around 60 °C while keeping the temperature of the flowing microchannel below 35 °C. The temperature difference between two microchannels was about 23 K when fan forced cooling (FFC) method was used. For normal performance of the gel <b>valve</b> <b>device,</b> a temporary pause of fluid flow for at least 5 s was required to complete the local gelation in the microchannel. Stable gel valve performance was obtained at the flow rates larger than 5 μl/min. The gel <b>valve</b> <b>device</b> showed no leakage up to 2. 07 × 104 Pa. close 6...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of the energy consumption of an <b>electronic</b> <b>valve</b> and a classical thermostatic valve has been compared when these expansion valves are adopted in a vapour compression plant subjected to a cold store. The main aim is to verify experimentally which type of expansion valve would be preferable from energy point of view when a classical thermostat or a fuzzy logic algorithm are used as the control system for the refrigeration capacity. The fuzzy logic-based control is able to modulate continuously the compressor speed through an inverter. The results show that with a fuzzy algorithm, the thermostatic expansion valve allows an energy saving of about 8 % {{in comparison with the}} <b>electronic</b> <b>valve.</b> When on–off control is used, the electric energy consumption obtained both with the <b>electronic</b> <b>valve</b> and with the thermostatic valve is comparable...|$|R

40|$|Spin <b>valve</b> <b>devices,</b> {{consisting}} of a free magnetic layer, a spacer layer, and a pinned magnetic layer, are widely used in magnetic sensors and nonvolatile magnetic memories. However, even a slight bending deformation can affect the magnetization direction of the free magnetic layer, which will change the magnetoresistance signal of the devices. Therefore, {{it is a challenge}} to develop a flexible spin <b>valve</b> <b>device</b> with controllable performance. Here, an enhanced stress-invariance of the magnetization direction in amorphous CoFeB magnetic films on flexible polyimide substrates is achieved. The uniaxial anisotropy is induced by growing on the bent substrate under a magnetic field, which aligns more magnetic domains with easy axes along the direction perpendicular to the subsequently applied stress. Theoretical calculations indicate that pre-induced anisotropy with an easy axis perpendicular to the applied stress effectively resists the change in the magnetization direction during bending. These results are of importance for realizing better performance of flexible spin <b>valve</b> <b>devices</b> and the development of flexible spintronics. Published by AIP Publishing...|$|R

40|$|Adopting <b>electronic</b> {{expansion}} <b>valves</b> in {{air conditioners}} enables an appreciable energy saving {{with respect to}} the same installations equipped with traditional thermostatic expansion valves. This {{is due to the fact}} that <b>electronic</b> <b>valves</b> allow a lower condensation pressure in systems equipped with air cooled condensers, which is adjusted to variations in outside air temperature. Furthermore, PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control over the superheating leads to the best use of evaporator under every condition (lower superheating level of the vapour refrigerant), thus increasing the refrigerating capacity. This paper reports on the results of a set of measurements that were carried out from March to November 2006 on the operation of eight direct expansion air conditioners having a total cooling capacity of 120 kW installed at a telephone control room near Bologna (North Italy).

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} <b>electronic</b> {{throttle}} <b>valve</b> {{systems has}} been very popular in the automotive industry.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{energetic}} and economic comparison between electronic and thermostatic expansion valve in a centralized refrigeration plant of a supermarket. Adopting <b>electronic</b> expansion <b>valves</b> enables an appreciable energy saving, {{due to the fact}} that <b>electronic</b> <b>valves</b> allow a lower condensation pressure in systems equipped with air cooled condensers, which is adjusted to variations in outside air temperature. Furthermore, superheating at the evaporator is lower and more stable, increasing cooling capacity and decreasing refrigerant temperature at the compressor discharge (the latter assures better efficiency and lower wear and tear for the compressor). This study is supported by an experimental work where the cabinets of a supermarket, located in the northern Italy, have been equipped with both thermostatic and <b>electronic</b> expansion <b>valves,</b> alternatively activated by solenoid valves on a daily basis, in order to compare the two systems in the same environment and at similar load conditions.

40|$|Background: Efficiency {{of a water}} {{management}} and irrigation control system is important for improved production and quality of crops. <b>Electronic</b> <b>valve</b> {{is one of the}} most important components for the irrigation management system, and the performance is characterized by the flow-pressure relationships. In the study, a test bench was developed to test <b>electronic</b> <b>valves</b> for irrigation management systems. Methods: A multistage pump (Model: DRL 10 - 8; DOOCH, Korea), flow rate sensors (Model: E-MAG-I, AUTOFLOW, Korea), and pressure sensors (Model: A- 10; WIKA, Germany) were used to construct the test bench. A control program was coded to control the pump operation. The flow rate was set at four different levels (20, 40, 60, 80 m 3 /h) using the multistage pump. Flow rate and pressure sensors were installed before and after the test electric valve. Data were collected through a wireless sensor network. The electric valve was controlled remotely by the software developed using C # (visual studio 2010, USA). Results& discussion: The experimental results showed that the error ranges were 2 % at 20 m 3 /h and 7 % at 80 m 3 /h. We found that the flow rate within 20 ~ 80 m 3 /h and the pressure loss within 2 ~ 10 bar measured before and after the electric valve were linearly plotted. The pressure decreased 10 % before and after the solenoid valve. The delay time need to be considered for stable flow control. To solve this problem, relief valve was installed to remove the flow rate exceeding the specified value. Conclusion: The test bench should a favourable performance, and will be used to test and compare <b>electronic</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R
