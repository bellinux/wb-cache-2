25|$|The present Mrs Bland is {{the second}} Mrs Bland. Mr Bland said his wife was the sole living {{relative}} for her family inheritance but she cannot both be sole heir and have a sister. Mr Bland's first wife died in the Second World War; he remarried soon after, to another Canadian woman. The family of his first wife had cut off communication with their daughter so thoroughly they did not <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> died. Sixteen years later, the first wife was announced to be the heiress to an overseas fortune as the last-known living relative. When this news reached the Blands, they decided the second Mrs Bland must pose as the first Mrs Bland. They fool a British firm of solicitors that sought the heir. When Quentin Duguesclin, who knew the first wife and her family, looked her up in England, a plan was laid to murder him. The plan was simple, with additions like the clocks taken from an unpublished mystery story that Miss Martindale had read in manuscript.|$|E
25|$|In episode 2, Kat and Alfie {{are invited}} to Lance's wake by Peter, and when {{speaking}} to Agnes and Lance's daughter, Eileen Harrington (Angeline Ball), Kat realises that Andrew cannot be her son. Agnes confronts Kat and Alfie, so Kat realises that Lance told her why they are there. Agnes says Kat gave up her right to see her son when she gave him up, but Kat explains she did not <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a son as she had passed out during the birth. Dermott and Tommy hear this, and Tommy asks {{if he has a}} big brother. Later, Kat and Alfie decide to return to Spain, but Tommy wants to find his brother. Tommy sneaks out of the house, and Kat and Alfie try to find him. Andrew's mother, Roisín Kelly (Maria Doyle Kennedy), tells Kat that she saw Tommy at the church, so they go there, followed by Agnes. They find Dermott praying with Tommy, who tells Kat that he found his brother. Kat realises that Dermott is her son, and Dermott confirms this. In episode 3, Kat and Dermott have bonded, but she lies to him about who his real father is. Dermott worries that Tommy will tell Peter the truth and threatens him. Alfie realises that Kat lied to Dermott, which results in an argument. Dermott overhears them arguing about him not knowing the truth and Kat refusing to tell him.|$|E
500|$|Jerry {{tries to}} apologize, even going {{as far as}} to compare ponies with compact cars, but Manya gets even more angry and leaves the table. Just after she leaves, Jerry tries to reason with the others that he did not <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a pony and wonders why {{immigrants}} with ponies would leave Europe to come to America without ponies ("Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country?") After the dinner, when Jerry's parents are leaving, his father soothes: [...] "Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony." [...] But Jerry receives a phone call from Uncle Leo, who informs him that Manya has died. Jerry is very upset about it, but he's also upset to learn that the funeral will be held on the same day of his softball championship.|$|E

500|$|During {{her second}} year of nursing school, Sanders was invited by an older nurse's aide to a Friday-night dinner party at the Nation of Islam temple in Harlem. [...] "The food was delicious," [...] Shabazz {{recalled}} in 1992, [...] "I'd never tasted food like that." [...] After dinner, the woman asked Sanders {{to come to the}} Muslims' lecture. Sanders agreed. After the speech, the nurse's aide invited Sanders to join the Nation of Islam; Sanders politely declined. When the woman asked her why she chose not to join the Nation of Islam after visiting, Sanders replied that she did not <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been brought there to join. [...] "Besides, my mother would kill me, and additionally I don’t even understand the philosophy." [...] The Malloys were Methodists, and when she was 13, Sanders had decided she would remain a Methodist {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
500|$|Beating as One expands Electr-O-Puras guitar-based pop to {{encompass}} {{a variety of}} other music genres, ranging from the bossa nova soundscapes of [...] "Center of Gravity" [...] to the electronic grooves of [...] "Autumn Sweater", the krautrock jams of [...] "Spec Bebop", the [...] "jazzy goof" [...] of [...] "Moby Octopad", the trip hop sound of [...] "Damage", and the psychedelic folk instrumentation of [...] "We're an American Band", among others. The album also contains two cover songs: [...] "Little Honda", a Beach Boys tune written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love, and [...] "My Little Corner of the World", recorded by musician and anti-gay activist Anita Bryant, although the band initially did not <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> ever recorded it. The former, which is a song that Kaplan learned for a solo guitar show, was originally used to make sure the recording equipment was set up right. However, it was ultimately included in the album because, according to bassist James McNew, [...] "it just sort of turned out pretty good." ...|$|E
2500|$|While recovering, Day {{started to}} sing {{along with the}} radio and {{discovered}} a talent she did not <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>had.</b> Day said: [...] "During this long, boring period, I used to while away {{a lot of time}} listening to the radio, sometimes singing along with the likes of Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey, and Glenn Miller [...] But the one radio voice I listened to above others belonged to Ella Fitzgerald. There was a quality to her voice that fascinated me, and I'd sing along with her, trying to catch the subtle ways she shaded her voice, the casual yet clean way she sang the words." ...|$|E
