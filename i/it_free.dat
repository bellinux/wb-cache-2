5|$|Black has {{the blood}} tested, and finds <b>it</b> <b>free</b> of any pathogen; meanwhile, the {{government}} center running the earlier briefing has vanished. Black realizes he was tricked into finding Zero for an ulterior motive, eventually learning that the organisation responsible is carrying out medical experiments on the homeless, {{and may be}} tied to the Millennium Group. Elsewhere a homeless man, acting similarly to Zero, attacks two policemen, and is killed in response. Black and fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) investigate, but are clearly not welcome. Black manages to obtain a blood sample from the dead man, and finds a stretcher tag which he believes {{is connected to the}} United States Department of Energy.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1916, J. Grossman's Sons {{contacted}} American jazz composers Peter DeRose and Ivan Reid {{to write}} a song about Grapico. DeRose, who would later {{be inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame, produced the piano accompanied song, Meet Me in the Land of Grapico. Meet Me in the Land of Grapico is a sentimental ballad from Tin Pan Alley that imagined a faraway Land of Grapico where love lives forever. The song (see below) and its cover sheet alluded to a grape vine-covered arbor in the Land of Grapico, even though Grapico contained no grape juice. Dedicating the song to all the drinkers of Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons published the song in 1916 and provided <b>it</b> <b>free</b> on request.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{sustained}} and concentrated attacks on radar left <b>it</b> <b>free</b> to help direct {{the deployment of}} RAF units at opportune moments. Its continued warnings of incoming raids were a crucial benefit to Fighter Command. The Luftwaffe also had poor intelligence {{on the type of}} RAF airfields. It made repeated errors, often misidentifying airfields as Fighter Command bases, which turned out to belong to RAF Coastal Command and RAF Bomber Command. On Adlertag, most of the targets on the Luftwaffes list—if destroyed—would not have impaired Fighter Command in the slightest.|$|E

5|$|While {{drawing the}} series, Fujima changed his art style from one used previously, {{though he was}} asked to use his {{original}} styling. He also noted that the series was different from his other works, and was unsure of how the audience would respond to <b>it.</b> <b>Free</b> Collars Kingdom is licensed for English language release in the United States by Del Rey, which released the series in 2007, and in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi, which released it in 2008. It was licensed for regional release by Tong Li Publishing in Taiwan, Jonesky in Hong Kong, and Star Comics in Italy. Free Collars Kingdom garnered mixed reviews from critics. The series was praised for its artwork and humor, but criticized for its plot and characters.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reasonably}} well used, it was unpopular with the public, who objected to being obliged to pay tolls to use it. On 4 July 1857, {{almost a year}} before the bridge's opening, a demonstration against the tolls attracted 6,000 residents. Concerns were raised in Parliament that poorer industrial workers in Chelsea, which had no large parks of its own, would be unable to afford to use the new park in Battersea. Bowing to public pressure, shortly after the bridge opened Parliament declared <b>it</b> <b>free</b> to use for pedestrians on Sundays, and in 1875 it was also made toll-free on public holidays. Additionally, because the main lights were only turned on when Queen Victoria was staying in London, it was poorly used at night. Despite this, the new Battersea Park was extremely popular, particularly the sporting facilities; on 9 January 1864 the park staged the world's first official game of association football.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} instead waits, the cabin gets transported to Aosagi Island. Yomogi, Mayuzumi, and Cocoro avoid the {{avalanche}} that was {{mentioned in the}} newspaper. The Yuni from 2011 is left at Akakura to be rescued by the rescue team in 2011, and to go to SPHIA in 2012 to repeat the loop, making sure that Cocoro, Yomogi, and Mayuzumi survive the week. Satoru reviews his theory regarding Inubushi; he thinks that she, too, was experiencing the transfer phenomenon, and that her consciousness ended up at Mount Akakura in the dying body of Hotori. He thinks the consciousness of Hotori inhabited Inubushi's body, rendering <b>it</b> <b>free</b> of homicidal tendencies, but realizes that since both his and Inubushi's consciousnesses remain at the island, Hotori cannot occupy Inubushi's body when he occupies his; Cocoro runs towards Inubushi, who is holding Utsumi's infant child {{over the edge of}} a cliff while singing. The game ends with Satoru meeting Mayuzumi, who says she does not recognize him.|$|E

5|$|The {{capsizing}} of {{the battleship}} Novorossiysk in Sevastopol harbor on 29 October 1955 delayed salvage operations on Stalingrad {{until the end}} of the year. The hull had to be patched, the water pumped out and all the projections removed to raise the stern slightly with pontoons, pivot into deeper water, then trim it down to elevate the bow off the bottom and pull <b>it</b> <b>free.</b> These preparations were very time-consuming and it wasn't until mid-July 1956 that it could be pulled off the rocks into Sevastopol harbor where she was given more permanent repairs. She was then moved to the Naval Firing Range between Yevpatoria and Sevastopol where it was used as a target for seven P-1 or KSS anti-ship missiles fired from the converted Sverdlov-class cruiser Admiral Nakhimov in December 1956. The missiles penetrated the upper and main decks and devastated the upper hull, but there was no appreciable change in the ship's draught. Details are not known about other tests, although she reportedly served as a target for P-15 Termit (SS-N-2 Styx) missiles and a wide variety of armor-piercing munitions. By the early 1960s her usefulness had come to an end and she was scrapped, possibly in 1962.|$|E

25|$|All public {{transport}} runs on infrastructure, either on roads, rail, airways or seaways. The infrastructure {{can be shared}} with other modes, freight and private transport, {{or it can be}} dedicated to {{public transport}}. The latter is especially valuable in cases where there are capacity problems for private transport. Investments in infrastructure are expensive and make up a substantial part of the total costs in systems that are new or expanding. Once built, the infrastructure will require operating and maintenance costs, adding to the total cost of public transport. Sometimes governments subsidize infrastructure by providing <b>it</b> <b>free</b> of charge, just as is common with roads for automobiles.|$|E
