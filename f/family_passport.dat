500|$|George Koval {{attended}} Central High School, a red-brick Victorian building {{better known}} as [...] "the Castle on the Hill". Neighbors recalled that Koval spoke openly of his Communist beliefs. While attending Central High {{he was a member}} of the Honor Society and the debate team. He graduated in 1929 at the age of 15. Meanwhile, his parents left Sioux City as the Great Depression deepened. Abram Koval became the secretary for ICOR, the Organization for Jewish Colonization in the Soviet Union. Founded by American Jewish Communists in 1924, the group helped to finance and publicize the development of the [...] "Jewish Autonomous Region" [...] – the Communist answer to Jewish emigration to the British Mandate of Palestine then being undertaken by the Zionist movement. The Koval family emigrated in 1932, traveling with a United States <b>family</b> <b>passport.</b> They settled in Birobidzhan, near the border of Manchuria.|$|E
500|$|Later, Koval was {{recruited}} by the Soviet Main Intelligence Directorate (Главное Разведывательное Управление), or GRU. By the time he received his degree he had left Moscow under orders {{as part of a}} subterfuge. He was drafted into the Soviet army in 1939 to explain his sudden disappearance from the city. Though his parents had relinquished their US <b>family</b> <b>passport,</b> Koval returned to the US in 1940, replacing a spy recalled during Stalin's purges. His code name was DELMAR. [...] Arriving in San Francisco, he traveled to New York City. According to Arnold Kramish, an American colleague he befriended and with whom he re-established contact in 2000, it was there that Koval assumed deputy command of the local GRU cell. This outpost operated under the cover of the Raven Electric Company, a supplier to firms such as General Electric. Koval told coworkers he was a native New Yorker and an only child. He ingratiated himself with everyone he met. While Koval originally worked under a pseudonym, gathering information on toxins for use in chemical weapons, his handlers decided to have him work under his real name.|$|E

50|$|Government troops then retake {{control of}} the area. We see them slip onto the {{plantation}} grounds immediately in front of Andre's father who calls out no warning to anyone inside. We see the troops move from room to room, slitting the throats of the rebels who are passed out from the orgy of food and medication. Government troops then lock the gun-toting Manuel {{in one of the}} farm buildings and burn him to death. Andre is shown dead {{on the floor of the}} house holding the <b>family</b> <b>passports.</b> In the town Maria is overwrought, she is seeking a way back to the house when Cherif sees her and gives her a ride. At the plantation Maria finds Manuel's charred body. Andre's father is shown walking around the barn where Manuel was burned. Maria hacks Andre's father to death with a machete, presumably seeing him at least partly responsible for the death of her son. Another reason may be the fact that Andre's father had promised Maria that she would inherit the plantation, but has broken the promise this very day by selling the land to Cherif, the mayor. Since Maria's ex-husband, who was instigator of the sale, has already been killed, his father is the only one in the family left to be punished.|$|R

Regardless, thousands of Jews had emigrated in the first eight months of 1987 through Austria. Perhaps half the Jews left Iran leaving about 30,000 Jews by 1986.
