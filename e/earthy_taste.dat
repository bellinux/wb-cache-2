60|$|The rainy season, {{like most}} other things {{connected}} with Abyssinia, has turned out a myth. It was to have come in November, then it was postponed to December, then the 1st of January was named as the latest time, and yet, {{with the exception of}} one heavy shower, we have had no rain whatever. The dust is blowing again in perfect clouds. We taste it in all we eat and in all we drink. Grit is perpetually between our teeth. As for our hair, what with sea-bathing and what with dust it is approaching fast to the appearance of a hedgehog’s back. Were it not for the evening bathe I do not know how we should get on. A great improvement has been effected in this respect during the last ten days. The end of the pier is now kept for officers only, the rest being devoted to the men. This is a great boon, and makes the end of the pier quite a pleasant place of assembly of an evening. Everyone is there, and everyone knows everyone else, so that it forms the grand rendezvous of the day. Our meeting-room is the sea, our toilet strict undress. I only wish that the water we use internally were as pleasant as the salt-water is for bathing, but the fact is, it is almost undrinkable. Why it is so no one seems to know; but there is no question as to the fact. It is extremely salt, and has a strong <b>earthy</b> <b>taste</b> in addition, and occasionally a disagreeable smell. Why it should be salt I know not, but can only suppose that the condensers are worked too hard, and that salt-water goes over with the steam. The earthy flavour and unpleasant smell which it sometimes has I attribute to the fact that the water which comes on shore from the ships must be bad. I have smelt exactly the same odour in water on board ship. The bad taste is so strong that it cannot be disguised or overpowered by the strongest admixture of spirits. By far the best water here is made by the condenser at the head of the pier, and this is served out to the European regiments, who are camped rather nearer to it than the native regiments are. Filters remove to a certain extent the <b>earthy</b> <b>taste,</b> but they do not alter the saline. A more serious matter even than the badness of the water is the fact that the supply has several times within the last ten days been insufficient, and hundreds of animals have had to go to their work in the morning, or to their beds at night, without a drop of water. It is this which lays the foundation of the lung-diseases, fills our hospitals with sick animals, to say nothing of the suffering caused to them. When the Scinde Horse, with their numerous baggage-animals, have moved forward, it is to be hoped that the naval authorities will be able to supply a sufficiency of drinkable water for the rest of the camp. The party of engineers have just begun a work which, when completed, will enable a much larger amount of stores to be landed daily than can at present be accomplished. They are driving piles so as to lengthen the pier some twenty or thirty yards, and to form a pier-head, on all sides of which lighters and boats can lie alongside to unload instead of only at one side, as at present. The commissariat wharf is also making considerable progress, and when this and the new pier-head are completed, the amount of stores which can be daily landed will be very large. As it is, it is wonderful what immense quantities of stores are landed and sent up the pier in the trucks by the commissariat, quartermaster, transport train, and engineer departments. Many hands make light work, and there is abundance of labour here, and a boat comes alongside, and its contents are emptied and placed upon a railway-truck in a very few minutes. Were a double line laid down the pier—which was specially built for it—and two or three connections or crossings laid down, so that full trucks could go out, and empty ones come in without waiting for each other, the capacity of the pier would be vastly greater than it is. Why this is not done no one seems to know. With the abundance of labour at hand it might be made in a day without interfering with the working of the present line. A great improvement has taken place in the conveyance of the post between this and Senafe. Ponies are in readiness at the various stations, and the mails are taken up in two days. Things are in fact getting into order in all the branches of the service, and with the exception of the water-supply and the ridiculously-slow progress of the railway, there is little to be wished for. The Punjaub Pioneers, whose arrival I mentioned in my last letter, are an uncommonly fine body of men. Their loose cotton dress and dark claret-brown turbans, and their picks and shovels slung across their shoulders, in addition to their arms and accoutrements, give them the appearance of a corps ready for any work; and this they have quite borne out. They have brought a number of ponies with them, and are fit for any service. The corps which have thus far arrived from Bengal and Madras have certainly done very great credit to these Presidencies, and make it a matter of regret that Bombay should have endeavoured to keep as far as possible the monopoly of an immense expedition like the present in her own hands. The Lahore division of the mule-train arrived here in the most perfect order. The saddles, accoutrements, &c., arrived with the mules, together with the proper complement of drivers, complete with warm clothing, &c. This division were therefore ready to take their load and to march up the very day after their landing, without the slightest confusion or delay. Of course the animals from Egypt and the Mediterranean could not arrive in this state of order, but there was no reason whatever why the Bombay division should not have arrived in a state of complete efficiency, instead of the animals coming by one ship, the drivers in another, the officers and inspectors in a third, and the accoutrements and clothing scattered over a whole fleet. Madras, too, has done well, although her contingent is a very small one. The Madras Sappers and Miners have greatly distinguished themselves, and the Madras dhoolie corps, which was raised and organised by Captain Smith, of the commissariat, has turned out of the very greatest utility. They have worked admirably, and have been quite willing to do any work to which they were set, however foreign it might be to the purpose for which they were engaged. Numbers of them have been transferred to the transport train; and, indeed, so useful has the corps proved, that orders have been sent to Madras for another of equal strength.|$|E

Although cyanobacteria have been reported to be largely responsible for these taste and odor events, the answer as to how or why geosmin is produced has eluded researchers. We describe here for the first time the mechanism by which geosmin is produced in a model cyanobacterium, Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 (ATCC 29133), which we demonstrate utilizes a single enzyme to catalyze the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to geosmin. Using this information, we have developed a PCR-based assay that allows the rapid detection of geosmin-producing cyanobacteria. This test may be utilized to confirm and track the emergence of taste and odor-producing cyanobacteria in any given water body and thus can be used as an early warning system by managers of water bodies that may suffer from adverse taste and odor episodes.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that chlorination of naturally coloured waters produces chloroform and other trihalomethanes in concentrations that are considerably higher {{than most of the}} organic microcontaminants commonly found in polluted surface waters. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the origin of the trihalomethanes in drinking water and the mechanism responsible for their formation. Chapter 1 gives a historical survey of the use of chlorine in drinking water treatment. The main application of chlorine originally was disinfection. Soon after, chlorination became common practice for the oxidative removal of <b>earthy</b> <b>tastes</b> and odors. Additionally the bleaching of naturally coloured water was found to be advantageous. As a result of studies of the various reactions between chlorine and inorganic ammonium the breakpoint phenomenon was discovered in 1940. Since then breakpoint chlorination is used for quantitative removal of ammonium from raw water. Until that time alternate methods of removal included biological means such as slow sand filtration. Breakpoint chlorination led to the development of water purification methods that could be accomplished by entirely physico-chemical treatment. However, as the levels of pollution of river Rhine water increased, the experience in Rotterdam was that breakpoint chlorination became less and less effective. Additionally the taste was adversely affected. In 1965 gaschromatography was applied in an attempt to determine the reaction products responsible for the taste problem. Chapter 2 describes the development in our laboratory of a modified headspace vapour analysis method for water. This allowed for the capture of minute amounts of volatile organics before and after chlorination of the river water. The technique basically is a static method in which a gas volume (headspace) is brought into equilibrium with the water sample. The headspace gas is collected on a cold trapping column which contains the same adsorbent as used for the stationary phase in the subsequent gaschromatographic separation. Using this technique for drinking water four large peaks were found which were not present in the untreated water. The four compounds were identified with chloroform, dichloro-bromomethane, chloro-dibromomethane and bromoform. Chapter 3 gives the analytical data obtained from Rotterdam drinking water, first prepared from river Rhine and later from river Meuse. Surprisingly the same four haloforms were found after chlorination of both waters. It was analytically established that the chlorine gas didnot contain trihalomethanes. Neither did it contain bromine in detectable amounts, i. e. less than 100 mg/kg. In an investigation of natural waters chloroform formation was found to occur after chlorination of samples from several unpolluted ponds and. lakes. Those that contained bromide-ions in concentrations higher thans 0. 1 mg/l also gave the brominated trihalomethanes. It was suspected that both the organic precursor for chloroform and the inorganic precursor for the brominated compounds were present in all types of natural waters. Chlorination resulted in the oxidation of Br -to HBrO, which in turn is known to react as a halogenating agent. Chapter 4 : Since the major soluble organic compounds in natural waters are humic substances - mainly fulvic acids - it was logical to assume that they are the organic precursor. Humic acids contain both carboxylic and phenolic functionalities. Polyphenols are known to make up for the bulk of the degradation products of humic acids. Furthermore several polyhydroxybenzenes are known to give the iodoform reaction. The combination of the latter two facts led to the theory that polyphenolic structures in the humic acid matrix are the reactive sites from which chloroform is formed. To prove this, the principle experiment consisted of chlorination of peat extracts and aqueous solutions of commercial humic acids. Both solutions gave chloroform when treated with chlorine. Addition of inorganic bromide before chlorination resulted in the formation of all four haloforms. Chapter 5 involves an investigation of the specific type of polyhydroxybenzene responsible for chloroform-formation. Compounds in which two hydroxy-groups are in the meta-position gave the highest yields of chloroform. We also found that in the methylethers of resorcinol and phloroglucinol the formation of chloroform is suppressed. This led to the theory that the phenoxide-ion is essential for the formation of the halogenated mono-carbon degradation product. It is a reasonable assumption that in the competetive oxidation and substitution reactions the aromatic nucleus is destroyed to give an alpha-chlorinated ketone. A reaction mechanism is proposed in which the carbon atom in between two meta-positioned OH-groups is chlorinated twice. This is followed by scission into a linear alpha-ketone. This intermediate is further chlorinated to RCCl 3 according to the pathways known to occur in the haloform reaction. In chapter 6 cursory pilot plant studies focused on removal of chloroform by adsorption on activated carbon are described. It was found that the adsorptive capacity of carbon for chloroform was too low to be of interest. Further investigation aimed at the removal of the fulvic acids which are the precursor for the trihalomethanes. Pre-ozonation was tried but had little effect. Some experimental results with macroporous ion exchance resins appear effective in removing a major portion of the precursor for the haloformformation...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. This study {{investigated}} the influence of ozone on water purification processes at Midvaal Water Company. The utility is situated {{on the banks of}} the Middle Vaal River in the North West Province and supplies potable water to the local municipality of Matlosana as well as surrounding mining companies. The Middle Vaal River is hypertrophic and the only raw water source for the treatment works. Midvaal usually experiences taste and odour problems during summer periods when the cyanoprokaryote, Oscillatoria, occurs in the raw water and produces geosmin and methylisoborneol (MIB). These compounds do not pose a health risk to consumers but degrade the aesthetic quality of the water. The <b>earthy,</b> muddy <b>tastes</b> and odours are detected at extremely low concentrations and are not effectively removed by conventional treatment methods which therefore necessitate the application of an advanced method such as ozonation. Midvaal has been using ozonation in their treatment process since 1985 and upgraded the ozonation plant in 2007. The aim of pre-ozonation at this plant is to improve dissolved air flotation (DAF) by inactivating the algal cells while intermediate ozonation is applied for oxidation of iron and manganese as well as colour improvement. Samples were collected weekly for a one year period from the raw water, after intermediate ozonation and after pre-ozonation and were measured for pH, electrical conductivity, turbidity, chlorophyll-a, total chlorophyll, dissolved and total organic carbon, manganese, iron, aluminium, SAC 254, geosmin, MIB as well as algal identification and enumeration. SAC 254, chlorophyll-a, total chlorophyll, total algal cells (of which the Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae dominated) and turbidity declined significantly after intermediate ozonation which was also supported by effect sizes. Intermediate ozonation had variable influences on pH, DOC, TOC, as well as manganese, iron and aluminium concentrations. Conductivity was the only variable to increase after intermediate ozonation together with MIB concentrations. The study showed that increased ozone dosages together with and optimum DAF process may alleviate taste and odour problems during Oscillatoria blooms and the associated occurrences of MIB in the raw water. Even though the water purification process did not rely heavily on ozonation for the oxidation of manganese, iron and aluminium concentrations in the raw water during the study period, it remained an essential step for improving colour. Other than the influence of ozonation on the water purification process, the study also demonstrated the crucial role of the DAF process in the overall success of the plant by removing a great number of algal cells intact. The study also showed that the Ozone Quicktest could successfully be applied to determine the ozone concentration in the process gas. Even though pre-ozonation did not have a significant effect on the chlorophyll concentrations of the raw water as was both desired and expected, the influence of pre-ozonation on the water purification and more especially the DAF process could not successfully be investigated during this study as the time was insufficient. The information obtained from this study is of value to Midvaal Water Company as well as other water utilities making use of or planning to apply ozonation as a means to increase the quality of potable water supplied to South African consumers.

40|$|The role {{of natural}} biofilms {{affecting}} {{the water quality}} in rivers has been the main theme in this study. Firstly, the study developed the capacity of biofilms in retention and/or production of DOC. Secondly, the study also approached {{the production of the}} geosmin metabolite by benthic cyanobacterial mats. In the two developed aspects, the structure and function of the biofilms showed their relevance in evaluating the capacity of biofilms on the amelioration of the water quality. The importance of the biofilms on ecological research in running waters has been focus in their capacity of adsorption and transformation of nutrient, and therefore, in the self-purification capacity of streams and rivers. Biofilms are also major sites of carbon cycling in streams and rivers, affecting the water DOC dynamics. Eutrophication of streams and rivers have been also linked with an increase of algal biomass. As a consequence, the massive growth of cyanobacterial mats can cause the production of toxic and nuisance metabolites, like geosmin, a secondary metabolite which causes <b>earthy</b> and musty <b>taste</b> and odor in the water. The first conclusion of this study was that biofilms may {{play an important role in}} the retention of water DOC. We elucidated whether biofilms act as sinks or sources of fluvial DOC, depending on their structure and biomass accumulation. Metabolism (extracellular enzymatic activity) and structure (algae, bacteria, C/N content) of light-growth and dark-growth systems were analyzed over a year. Biofilms from the light-growth regime presented monthly variation in DOC uptake/release rates, but the annual average presented higher DOC uptake than dark-growth biofilms. However, the latter had a constant DOC consumption along the year, permitting a maintenance of low water DOC levels. The biofilm structure and the relative contribution of autotrophs and heterotrophs had a relevant implication in the carbon recycling, since metabolic activities were affected by variations in this structure. Geosmin production was related with the massive growth of benthic cyanobacteria (formed mainly by Oscillatoria limosa) in littoral zones, where water velocity was low, warmer temperatures and high nutrient concentration and low N/P ratio. The masses were further detached and drift downstream, being the responsible for the dispersion of geosmin along the river. The high biomass accumulation per surface unit, may cause a nutrient depletion inside the mat, e. g. nitrogen limitation. Structural and functional differences were found in the different fractions of the cyanobacterial mat (attached vs. free-floating). Free-floating mats presented higher biomass and exoenzymatic activities. Otherwise, the low phosphatase/aminopeptidase ratio found in both compartments indicated a nitrogen limitation inside the mats. Microstructural analyses with oxygen and redox microsensors have been useful to understand the function of the different cyanobacterial patches inside the mat. During the dark, Oscillatoria micro-patches aggregated and accumulated in thick masses where some anoxia conditions were found, giving a very low redox potential. This low diffusion could be associated with resource depletion, limiting the nutrient availability and defining the appropriate conditions for the geosmin production...|$|R
