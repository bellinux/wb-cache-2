The post sunset emission rate of OI is generally asymmetrical {{with respect to the}} geomagnetic equator and shows no apparent correlation with the ultraviolet airglow (OI 1304 and 1356 A) and F region electron density measured simultaneously from the same spacecraft.

To accurately describe the energy transfer in O + H_ 2 (v,j) collisions, we performed extensive quantum-mechanical calculations of state-to-state elastic, inelastic, and reactive cross sections. The escape flux of H_ 2 molecules was evaluated using a simplified 1 D column model of the martian atmosphere with realistic densities of atmospheric gases and hot oxygen production rates for the low solar activity conditions. An average density of the non-thermal escape flux of H_ 2 of 1. 9 × 10 ^ 5 cm^- 2 s^- 1 was obtained considering energetic O atoms produced in <b>dissociative</b> <b>recombinations</b> of O_ 2 ^+ ions.

By applying the reaction rate constants (α, β, and γ) corresponding {{to all of the}} currently available characterized reactions involving , it is possible to calculate k(T) for each of these reactions. By multiplying these k(T) by the relative abundances of the products, the relative rates (in cm3/s) for each reaction at a given temperature can be determined. These relative rates can be made in absolute rates by multiplying them by the 2. By assuming T=10K for a dense cloud and T=50K for a diffuse cloud, the results indicate that most dominant formation and destruction mechanisms were the same for both cases.

This method, utilizing the unique beam characteristics of the vacuum UV beamline DESIRS at the French synchrotron facility SOLEIL, has revealed an efficient indirect desorption mechanism that scales with the electronic excitations in molecular solids. This process, known as DIET – desorption induced by electronic transition – occurs efficiently in ices composed of very volatile species (CO, N 2), for which photochemical processes can be neglected. In the present study, we investigate the photodesorption energy dependence of pure and pre-irradiated CO 2 ices at 10 – 40 K and between 7 and 14 eV. The photodesorption from pure CO 2 is limited to photon energies above 10. 5 eV and is clearly initiated by CO 2 excitation and by the contribution of <b>dissociative</b> and <b>recombination</b> channels. The photodesorption from “pre-irradiated” ices is shown to present an efficient additional desorption pathway below 10 eV, dominating the desorption depending on the UV-processing history of the ice film.

40|$|Discussed {{here are}} new {{observations}} of 3 -carbon-containing interstellar molecules which {{play an important}} role in the chemistry of dense molecular clouds: protonated carbon dioxide, formic acid, and propynal. In 1984 a new oxide of carbon, C 3 O, was discovered in the interstellar medium (Matthews et al. 1984; Brown et al. 1985). Theoretical models suggest that C 3 O is produced by <b>dissociative</b> electron <b>recombination</b> with the ion H 3 C 3 O+. Although no laboratory data for the branching ratios of such a recombination exist, it seemed to us likely that additional products would include H 2 C 3 O. This molecule has more than one isomeric form, but one stable species is propynal (HC 2 CHO), which had been suggested as a possible interstellar molecule by Winnewisser (1973). In observations at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory 43 m telescope in Green Bank earlier this year, researchers detected a line in the cold cloud TMC- 1 which they assign to the 2 (0, 2) - 1 (0, 1) transition of propynal. The observed line agrees with the laboratory frequency to well within the experimental uncertainty a few parts in 10 to the 7 th power. Researchers sought and failed to detect the corresponding 2 (1, 1) - 1 (1, 0) line, which is understandable given the presence of both a and b components of the electric dipole moment in propynal. The b type transitions will drain population from energy levels with K(sub p) does not equal 0 into the K(sub p) equal 0 stack. If the researchers' assignment is correct, this is the first interstellar detection of propynal. Assuming typical rotational temperatures for TMC- 1 and that the line is optically thin, the column density determined is about 5 times 10 to the 12 th power cm to the - 2 nd power, or about three times that for C 3 O. Formic acid (HCOOH) was the first organic acid to be observed in the interstellar medium, in the Galactic center source Sgr B 2. The only other interstellar detection has been recently made in the giant molecular cloud in Orion. As part of the same project that led to the detection of propynal, researchers sought formic acid in the nearby, cold dark clouds TMC- 1 and L 134 N. It is seen only in L 134 N. This difference between the two clouds appears to be consistent with a model in which the oxygen/carbon ratio is higher in L 134 N. This would be consistent with the higher abundances for SO and SO 2, observed in that cloud, and the higher abundances of many carbon-rich species in TMC- 1 (Irvine et al. 1985) ...|$|R
