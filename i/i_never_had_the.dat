5|$|In 2011, The Exorcist was re-released in a 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback, hardcover, and {{audiobook}} formats {{with new}} cover artwork. As described by Blatty, this new, updated edition features new and revised material. The 40th Anniversary Edition of The Exorcist {{will have a}} touch of new material in {{it as part of}} an all-around polish of the dialogue and prose. First time around <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable – plus one new character in a totally new very spooky scene. This is the version I would like to be remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E
2500|$|Her father, however, was not {{impressed}} with her goal {{of becoming a}} photographer on her own. He wanted her to at least take some formal training with a professional photographer. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> patience for that," [...] she said. [...] "I had to trust my feelings." [...] She did however study the photography of horses at college in Arizona under Hazel Larsen Archer, and became at that time an avid nature hobbyist, using a high quality Leica camera. A few months after her Rolling Stones shoot, she was allowed back stage at Shea Stadium where the Beatles performed.|$|E
2500|$|David Amram, {{first met}} Woody Guthrie in 1956. [...] In his {{report of the}} 2005 WoodyFest he remembers that meeting: [...] "Ever since that day we first met, I have always hoped that someday I would {{get the chance to}} go to Okemah, but with my crazy {{schedule}} <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to do so. When I was invited to the festival, I realized that I would be finally be able to see his hometown, and be able to meet his sister, her husband and his remaining old friends from long ago who were still living there. By doing that, and by playing music and spending time with people who were also natives of Okemah, I knew that I would be able to understand Woody and his work in a deeper way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{should think}} so," [...] Dick said. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> climbed so high as that, because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> chance; but {{it ought to}} be easy enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, General; he {{commanded}} the brigade of which my regiment formed part, {{and of course}} I knew him by sight, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> honour of exchanging a word with him." ...|$|R
60|$|HE [earnestly] Believe me, you are. I assure you, on {{my honor}} as a gentleman, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> {{slightest}} feeling for Mrs Bompas beyond the ordinary esteem and regard of a pleasant acquaintance.|$|R
60|$|The General {{seemed not}} to {{remember}} my part in that adventure, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> heart {{to tell him about}} it.|$|E
60|$|CHARLES. True true as {{you were}} going to say--then seriously <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> least idea of what you charge me with, upon my honour.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to have done him justice before," [...] said Soames; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> chance. Have you got a 'Baronetage' here?" ...|$|E
60|$|M. Ugly word, that. <b>I</b> should <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{courage to}} own up.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope," [...] said Athelstane, {{somewhat}} {{moved by}} {{this part of}} his friend's discourse, [...] "they will not forget to send us some wine and refactions at noon--we had scarce a breathing-space allowed to break our fast, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> benefit of my food when I eat immediately after dismounting from horseback, though the leeches recommend that practice." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>have.</b> But <b>the</b> {{incident}} remains quite unexplained either by Bickley or Bastin.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I,' {{cried the}} dealer. 'I in love! <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> time, nor have I the time to-day {{for all this}} nonsense. Will you take the glass?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I," [...] {{cried the}} dealer. [...] "I in love! <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> time, nor have I the time to-day {{for all this}} nonsense.--Will you take the glass?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg pardon ma'am, but I never disobeyed {{you that}} I know of. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> honour of setting eyes upon you till I came to these ugly quarters." ...|$|E
5000|$|Daryabandari once stated, [...] "Looking {{into the}} life of the rabble, the author in this book {{pictures}} a painful tragedy. The scenes described in the book are reminiscent of masterpieces written by Leo Tolstoy and Honoré de Balzac. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> same opinion about any other Persian books." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the night}} the clock gave us another warning, and my wife {{accepted}} it for her Aunt Maria, and seemed resigned. She wished, however, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> clock, and wondered when, if ever, I should get cured of my absurd craze for filling the house with tomfoolery.|$|R
60|$|DONE. Indeed <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> yet <b>had</b> <b>the</b> {{brutality}} {{to ask a}} {{woman to}} share my life out here.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said she, with a tone {{of great}} satisfaction, [...] "how nice this is! And what a gentlemanly {{conductor}}! <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> conductor treat me so politely in my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't all be Stanleys and Burtons," [...] said I; [...] "besides, we don't get the chance,--at least, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> chance. If I did, I {{should try}} to take it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is no wit, Mr. Bally," [...] said I: [...] "a dry Scots humour, and {{something}} of the driest." [...] And, indeed, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> least pretension to be thought a wit.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2012, Dubey {{participated in}} Sony Entertainment Television's reality-based comedy series of Comedy Circus titled, Kahani Comedy Circus Ki. Dubey said, [...] "I am super excited as I <b>have</b> always loved <b>the</b> show. So far <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} to try my hands at comedy, which I believe is the toughest of all".|$|R
6000|$|He {{answered}} this sadly. [...] "My {{time has}} gone by. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> opportunities that <b>have</b> been granted to some favored men." [...] He {{thought of the}} favored man who had married Mrs. Norman. Was her husband worthy of his happiness? [...] "Is Mr. Norman with you at this place?" [...] the Captain asked.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, now,' {{said the}} old lady, {{grasping}} her umbrella, 'that is undoubtedly a clue; but then, you see, {{all but one of}} the friends of my girlhood are dead; and if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> pleasure of meeting her son, unless there is a decided resemblance, how am I to recollect HER by looking at HIM?' ...|$|R
60|$|Your former letter <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> honour to receive;--be assured in {{whatever}} {{part of the}} world it had found me, I should have deemed it my duty to return and answer it in person.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen. I'm {{going to}} tell you the truth, Molly--I've been trying to for days, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> pluck. I wasn't {{stealing}} this necklace, but for seven years I lived by this sort of thing." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> {{heart to}} throw {{cold water on}} Euphemia's noble emotions, and so I did not tell her that the notice merely {{requested}} travellers to remove from their trunks the anciennes etiquettes, or old railway labels.|$|E
60|$|It is {{generally}} the custom with man-of-war's-men to stand obsequiously touching their hat at every sentence they {{address to the}} Captain. But as this was not obligatory upon me by the Articles of War, I {{did not do so}} upon the present occasion, and previously, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> dangerous honour of a personal interview with Captain Claret.|$|R
60|$|The {{beating of}} my heart came back again. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard <b>the</b> voice, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen <b>the</b> face, but it {{affected}} me in the same strange way. Again, in a moment, there arose before my mind innumerable pictures of myself.|$|R
60|$|I {{have some}} letters here which would ruin the {{happiness}} of a very worthless woman I know. I'm burning them so that <b>I</b> may <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> temptation to use them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mamma, then <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> sign of {{the cross}} on my forehead! It does not feel blest!' And then, hastily and low, she muttered,' Oh! is that why I never could bear the cross in all my life!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So far as {{exercise}} can teach--it without real {{service in the}} field," [...] answered Roland Graeme; [...] "but our Knight permitted none of his household to make raids, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> good fortune to see a stricken field." ...|$|E
60|$|If you are diffident, I {{suspect that}} you ought to let Osgood be your magazine-agent. He makes those people pay three or four times as much as an article is worth, whereas <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> cheek to make them pay more than double.|$|E
60|$|A LOYAL British subject {{like myself}} {{in dealing with}} the {{government}} of England should necessarily begin with a discussion of <b>the</b> monarchy. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> pleasure of meeting the King,--except once on the G.T.R. platform in Orillia, Ontario, when he was the Duke of York and I was one of the welcoming delegates of the town council. No doubt he would recall it in a minute.|$|R
6000|$|... "I confess my ignorance, and {{am willing}} to admit all you claim for this {{wonderful}} invention. But {{do you think it}} compensates for the loss of the individual person? Take my own case--if you will not think me personal. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> pleasure of seeing you; do you believe that I am content with only that suggestion of your personality which the satisfaction of hearing your voice affords me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As <b>I</b> may <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} again," [...] said Lothair, [...] "let me thank you, Lady Corisande, {{for some}} kind thoughts which you deigned to bestow on me in my absence." ...|$|R
