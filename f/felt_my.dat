Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E
500|$|Despite the tone, Etty {{was pleased}} to be noticed by a {{newspaper}} as influential as The Times, and much later confessed how delighted he was that the [...] "Times noticed me. I <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> chariot wheels were on the right road to fame and honour, and I now drove on like another Jehu!" [...] Possibly {{as a result of}} the criticism in The Times, Freeling asked Etty to overpaint the figures in the foreground of Cleopatra. In 1829, after Etty had become a respected artist, Freeling allowed the restoration of the figures to their original condition.|$|E
500|$|Promoted acting wing {{commander}} in June 1943, Arthur became wing leader of No.71 Wing, which controlled No.75 Squadron {{and three other}} combat units. On 5November, {{he was involved in}} a collision at Kiriwina Airfield with a Spitfire of No.79 Squadron. The Spitfire pilot was killed, and Arthur received serious burns. He later recalled, [...] "...I <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> hands disappear, <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> face go but the rest of my body was...was just flames...And {{then all of a sudden}} the flames dropped down a bit and I got out and went like mad and I was running away from the aircraft and trying to guess how far I could go before I'd try to put the flames out..." [...] Although his family was informed that his injuries were [...] "of a very slight nature" [...] and that he had been [...] "burnt but not badly", Arthur was close to death for weeks while he was treated in Kiriwina. [...] He was finally repatriated to Sydney where he underwent plastic surgery at Yaralla Military Hospital (now Concord Hospital). After his recovery in April 1944, he attended a staff course before taking over command of No.2 Operational Training Unit at Mildura, Victoria. In August, at the age of 24, he was promoted to temporary group captain, the youngest in the RAAF. That December he took command of No.81 Wing of the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), based at Noemfoor and Labuan in the Dutch East Indies.|$|E

500|$|Brown {{had already}} {{completed}} recording sessions for Don't Be Cruel in Los Angeles, California, but felt {{something was missing}} in the record. He said, [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better than New York {{to come up with}} it'". He travelled to the city with producer Gene Griffin. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] was written and co-produced by Brown and Griffin. It was recorded at Axis Studios and mixed at Soundworks, in New York. The track was mastered at Future Disc Systems in Hollywood, California. During an interview with The Hour on March 17, 1989, Brown explained the theme behind the song, saying, [...] "A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, why was he doing this [...] It's my way of expressing to people it's your prerogative to do as you want, but make sure what you do is the right thing". A CD single of remixes by Joe T. Vannelli was released on October 13, 1995.|$|E

In his autobiography, he cites his increasing struggles facing the short ball as a principal cause of his problems: [...] "I felt I was being questioned as a man. I <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> dignity was being stripped away with every short ball I ducked or parried. It was degrading." ...|$|E

The Hon. Josiah Quincy, Stephen Higginson, Esq. and William Shaw, Esq. were some of its first promoters. This providential interference excited my most lively gratitude to my generous benefactors, and I hope I sensibly <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> deep obligation to the source of all good.” ...|$|E

Barnes wrote, [...] "If I, play acting, <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> being burning with revolt at this brutal usurpation {{of my own}} functions, how they who actually suffered the ordeal in its acutest horror must have flamed at the violation of the sanctuaries of their spirits." [...] She concluded, [...] "I had shared the greatest experience of the bravest of my sex." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 2014 autobiography, Wright says he {{considers}} Footprint to be [...] "a far more melodic album than Extraction", adding: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> songwriting {{was beginning to}} blossom." [...] John Barham, Harrison's regular orchestral arranger, provided string arrangements {{on some of the}} album's songs. One such track was the ballad [...] "Love to Survive", which Barham later described as [...] "one of the most emotionally powerful love songs that I have ever worked on". In his biography of Harrison, Leng notes the influence of [...] "Love to Survive" [...] on the ex-Beatle's subsequent songwriting, particularly [...] "That Is All", released on Living in the Material World (1973).|$|E
2500|$|On the {{evolution}} of technique in his illustration, Grossman has said, [...] "I {{was impressed by the}} way David Levine and the Push Pin artists were using line to develop a bulgy three-dimensional feeling in their work. I found an old airbrush in my dad's shop and discovered a jiffy way to outbulge them all. For a while I diligently pursued outline-less-ness as the secret to a real stereoscopic three-dimensional look. I <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> line work belonged to a different world {{that had nothing to do}} with the airbrush and went its separate way. Lately I find a strong line reasserting itself in my pictures." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1906, Rischbieth {{and others}} founded the Children's Protection Society in Western Australia {{and joined the}} Women's Service Guilds of Western Australia in 1909. The Rischbieths {{travelled}} throughout Japan and India, and stayed in London during either 1908 or 1913. Women's suffrage was a dominant topic in Britain at this time; a mass rally, subsequent public debate and prosecutions of activists were occurring. The pacifist response to the Cat and Mouse Act in particular, fired {{a passion for the}} equality movement. After hearing Emily Pankhurst speak for the Women's Social and Political Union, she wrote to her sister, [...] "... as I listened, I <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> backbone growing longer, as though you gained courage and freedom from her".|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Tall Chief's {{paternal}} great-grandfather, Peter Bigheart, {{had helped}} negotiate for the Osages concerning oil revenues that enriched the Osage Nation. Her father grew up rich as a result, never working [...] "a {{day in his}} life." [...] In her autobiography, Tall Chief explained [...] "As a young girl growing up on the Osage reservation in Fairfax, Oklahoma, I <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> father owned the town. He had property everywhere. The local movie theater on Main Street, and the pool hall opposite, belonged to him. Our 10-room, terracotta-brick house stood high on a hill overlooking the reservation." [...] The family spent summers in Colorado Springs to escape the Oklahoma heat. Life was far from perfect, though, as {{her father was a}} binge drinker and her parents often fought about money.|$|E
2500|$|Clarke {{related the}} {{experience}} of Donna Tagliaferri, who described [...] "a terrifying incident after meeting Cosby in the mid-1970s through tennis" [...] {{when she was in}} her early 20s. After playing tennis with Cosby a number of times, he invited her on a dinner date and then invited her up to his hotel room. Tagliaferri had a girlfriend accompany them. After showing them around the penthouse, [...] "things changed dramatically and quickly. He made it clear to me in a very aggressive way what his intentions were. He chillingly said to me, 'I will have you.' Those words are imprinted on my brain along with the evil I <b>felt.</b> <b>My</b> first thought was, 'No you will not.' Then shock took over, and when words wouldn't come a paralyzing feeling did." [...] At this point her girlfriend started talking and got them out of the situation: [...] "I {{have no way of knowing}} what would have happened if Wendy had not been there. What I do know is his words were an assault to me never to be forgotten. And the betrayal of a friendship was staggering." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I <b>felt</b> <b>my</b> heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E
