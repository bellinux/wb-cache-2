5|$|At {{the end of}} May 1945, the {{division}} was pulled out of Germany and returned to England.

The division’s advance party, <b>formed</b> <b>around</b> the 5th Parachute Brigade, had already arrived in India. Following the Japanese surrender, all these plans changed. The post-war British Army only needed one airborne division, and the 6th Airborne was chosen to remain on strength.

5|$|Communities have <b>formed</b> <b>around</b> the creation, {{play and}} {{discussion}} of LARP. These communities have developed a subculture that crosses over with role-playing, fan, reenactment, and drama subcultures. Early LARP subculture focused on Tolkien-like fantasy, but it later broadened to include appreciation of other genres, especially the horror genre with the rapid uptake of the World of Darkness setting in the 1990s. Like many subcultures, LARP groups often have a common context of shared experience, language, humour, and clothing that can be regarded {{by some as a}} lifestyle.|$|E

With an {{authorised}} strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the 2/17th was <b>formed</b> <b>around</b> a nucleus of four rifle companies– designated 'A' through to 'D'– each consisting of three platoons; these {{were supported by}} a battalion headquarters and a headquarters company with six specialist platoons: signals, pioneer, anti-aircraft, transport, administrative and mortars.|$|E

While there, it received a number of drafts of recruits and was brought up to strength. With an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the battalion was <b>formed</b> <b>around</b> a nucleus of four rifle companies– designated 'A' through to 'D'– each consisting of three platoons.|$|E

At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.|$|E
5|$|Originally it was {{believed}} that Lake Cahuilla <b>formed</b> <b>around</b> 900 AD and existed until 1500 but with fluctuations as the Colorado River changed its course. In 1978, Philip J. Wilke proposed that two highstands occurred, one between 900 and 1250 and another between 1300-1500. Another proposal by Waters in 1983 suggested highstands 700-900, 940-1210 and after 1250, the latter with some brief recessions to lower lake levels. Both proposals were criticized {{on the grounds that they}} came to definite conclusions with insufficient information.|$|E

Arachnoid villi are <b>formed</b> <b>around</b> the 35th week of development, with aracnhoid granulations noted around the 39th, and continuing developing until 18 months of age.|$|E
