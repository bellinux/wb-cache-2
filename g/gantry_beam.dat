50|$|Overhead gantry-style {{positioning}} system's placement head {{is mounted}} on a <b>gantry</b> <b>beam</b> (X-axis). During the sequence, the beam moves perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} placement head movement, which offers two degrees of freedom (X and Y alignment) in a plane parallel to the machine table. The PCB and feeders keep stationary during placement. The PCB is located on the table by identifying global and local fiducials through a vision system. This placement head moves along the axis beams to pick components from a feeder, and then moves into position to place the components. A vacuum nozzle on the placement head moves up and down vertically to provide Z-axis and rotates in the horizontal plane to provide theta angular alignment. Sometimes a secondary vision system is also applied to check the correctness and alignment of the components after pick-up and before placement.As the PCB and feeders remain stationary in the placement sequence, the additional sources of positional inaccuracy are eliminated. Overhead gantry-style machine has the best placement accuracy among all types and is utilized by flexible placers exclusively. It offers greater flexibility and accuracy, but cannot match the speeds of other styles. Machines with multiple gantries can achieve faster speed.|$|E

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on June 11, 2014). Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) is a {{rotational}} radiation therapy {{which has been}} used to treat various cancer sites. The continuous delivery of a specific treatment plan for arc therapy can be achieved with multiple solutions for speed of <b>gantry</b> rotation, <b>beam</b> dose rate variation in time and with various speeds of trajectories of MLC leaves. This non uniqueness of arc therapy delivery creates a situation that, given treatment plan can be delivered with arc with variable degrees of efficiency. In this work, we evaluated advanced delivery techniques to improve delivery time and patient safety. VMAT has gained {{a lot of interest in}} the present days because of less treatment time and more conformal dose distribution with single and multiple arcs as compared to intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). In this work we mainly focus on the fundamentals of intensity modulated arc therapy and importantly the single arc version of it. We provide special emphasis on understanding the delivery aspects of the therapy. The interdependence between several delivery parameters (<b>gantry</b> angular speed, <b>beam</b> dose rate and MLC leaf velocity) in the delivery of VMAT treatment plan for both static and the moving targets has been studied. We described the challenges involved in the VMAT delivery for moving targets, motion model and relation between the delivery parameters. We combined multiple arcs into a single arc to improve delivery efficiency. We also studied the effect of fourth delivery parameter along with gantry speed, dose rate and leaf speed which is the gantry acceleration and included it as a constraint during the delivery. The advanced quality assurance technique for VMAT delivery has been explored.

Methods: The method is based on identically prescribed biologically effective dose (iso-BED) which was achieved by different prescribed doses due to different fractionation schemes. It is performed by converting the calculated three-dimensional dose distribution to the corresponding BED distribution taking into consideration the different number of fractions for generic α/β ratios. A cumulative BED volume histogram (BEDVH) is then derived from the BED distribution and is compared for the two delivery schemes. Ten breast cancer patients (4 right-sided and 6 left-sided) were investigated. Two tangential intensity modulated whole breast beams with two other oblique (with different <b>gantry</b> angles) <b>beams</b> for the boost volume were used. The boost and the breast target volumes with either α/β[*]=[*] 10 or 3  Gy, and ipsi-lateral and contra-lateral lungs, heart, and contra-lateral breast as organs at risk (OARs) with α/β[*]=[*] 3  Gy were compared. Results: Based on the BEDVH comparisons, the use of SIB reduced the biological breast mean dose by about 3 %, the ipsi-lateral lung and heart by about 10 %, and contra-lateral breast and lung by about 7 %.

40|$|We are {{presenting}} the layout and the optics of a beam line {{to be used}} as a medical gantry in radiation therapy. The optical properties of the <b>gantry's</b> <b>beam</b> line are such as to make the beam line achromatic and uncoupled. These two properties make the beam spot size, which is delivered and focused by the gantry, on the tumor of the patient, independent of the angular orientation of the gantry. In this paper we present the layout of the magnetic elements of the gantry, and also present the theoretical basis for the optics design of such a gantry. A medical gantry, as it is used in the radiation treatment of cancer patients, is the last part of the beam optical system, of the accelerator complex, which delivers and focuses the beam on the tumor. The curved line shown in figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a gantry which can rotate about a horizontal axis. The particle beam (green arrow in fig. 1) enters the gantry, and is guided by the gantry on the tumor (red spot in fig. 1). As the gantry rotates about the axis shown in figure 1, the <b>beam</b> exiting the <b>gantry</b> always lies on a plane normal to the rotation axis at the point of the icocenter. Thus the gantry facilitates the ability of the beam delivery system, to deliver the beam at the tumor, which is placed at the icocenter, from any angle on this vertical plane, which is normal to the rotation angle of the gantry as stated earlier. The gantry consists of dipoles and quadrupoles elements whose median symmetry plane lies on a plane which contains the rotation axis of the gantry. In this paper we define this plane as the 'plane of the gantry'. As the beam is transported along the axis of rotation of the gantry and before it enters the gantry, it is focused by 'normal' quadrupoles and experiences no linear beam coupling. Subsequently the <b>beam</b> enters the <b>gantry,</b> and is transported by the gantry to the delivery point which is the tumor. The transported beam at the tumor is still linearly uncoupled as long as the plane of the gantry lies either, on the horizontal, or the vertical plane. In these two orientations of the gantry the dipoles and the quadrupoles are 'normal' therefore the linear R-transport-matrix appears linearly uncoupled. As the gantry rotates about this horizontal axis, to irradiate the tumor at a different angle, the linear beam coupling is unavoidable since the coordinate system of the gantry's quadrupoles is rotated with respect to the coordinate system of the quadrupoles at the entrance of the gantry which are located along the axis of rotation. As a result, in this rotated coordinate system, the beam will be linearly coupled as it is transported by the gantry to the tumor and the beam size at the location of the tumor will vary in size depending on the orientation of the gantry. In this paper we present a method which makes the beam transport R-matrix linearly uncoupled, achromatic and independent of the orientation angle of the gantry as is proven in the following section...|$|R

One beam is characterized by a passive delivery technique and is dedicated to the eyes treatment (OPTIS 2 beam line). Alanine pellets were irradiated with a 70 MeV proton beam corresponding to 35 mm range in eye tissue. We investigated how collimators with different sizes and shape used to conform the dose to the planned target volume influence the delivered dose. For this purpose we performed measurements with varying the collimator size (Output Factor) and the results were compared with those obtained with other dosimetric techniques (such as Markus chamber and diode detector). This analysis showed that the dosimeter response is independent of collimator diameter if this is larger than or equal to 10 mm.

The alanine response was found to be linear in the dose in the clinical explored range (from 10 to 70 Gy).

40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that, {{among the different}} kinds of radiations usable for radiotherapy, high energy proton beams exhibit the best ballistic specificity. However, the development of proton therapy has been hindered by the size, cost and complexity of high energy accelerators. We have therefore tried to design not only an accelerator, but a complete proton therapy facility where the size, the investment, the complexity and the cost of operation would be minimized. To optimize the reliability of the system we selected a non-superconducting isochronous cyclotron as accelerator. The magnet is a high field (3. 09 T peak field, 2. 165 T average field at extraction) deep valley design, using 190 kW in conventional coils. The complete cyclotron is split in two parts at the median plane. The upper half can be quickly raised by 1 m, using hydraulic jacks, allowing an unrestricted access to all cyclotron elements. This design feature, combined with a rapid pump downtime (30 min) should contribute towards maintaining the downtime of the accelerator to very low values.

40|$|This project {{developed}} {{a solution for}} verifying external photon beam radiotherapy. The solution {{is based on a}} calibration chain for deriving portal dose maps from acquired portal images, and a calculation framework for predicting portal dose maps. Quantitative comparison between acquired and predicted portal dose maps accomplishes both geometric (patient positioning with respect to the beam) and dosimetric (2 D fluence distribution of the beam) verifications. A disagreement would indicate that beam delivery had not been according to plan. The solution addresses the clinical need for verifying radiotherapy both pre-treatment (without patient in the beam) and on-treatment (with patient in the beam). Medical linear accelerators mounted with electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) were used to acquire portal images. Two types of EPIDs were investigated: the amorphous silicon (a-Si) and the scanning liquid ion chamber (SLIC). The EGSnrc family of Monte Carlo codes were used to predict portal dose maps by computer simulation of radiation transport in the beam-phantom-EPID configuration. Monte Carlo simulations have been implemented on several levels of High Throughput Computing (HTC), including the Grid, to reduce computation time. The solution has been tested across the entire clinical range of <b>gantry</b> angle, <b>beam</b> size (5 cm x 5 cm to 20 cm x 20 cm), beam-patient and patient-EPID separations (4 cm to 38 cm). In these tests of known beam-phantom-EPID configurations, agreement between acquired and predicted portal dose profiles was consistently within 2 % of the central axis value. This Monte Carlo portal dosimetry solution therefore achieved combined versatility, accuracy and speed not readily achievable by other techniques.

40|$|AbstractOne of the {{functions}} of a medical gantry is to irradiate a tumor from different angles to reduce the dose received by the healthy tissue which surrounds the tumor. The rotation of the gantry rotates also its quadrupoles that focus the beam, {{as a result the}} beam is “coupled” {{in the sense that the}} horizontal motion of the beam particles is affected by the vertical motion and vice-versa therefore the beam spot size at the tumor may vary with the angular orientation of the gantry. Although such a beam-coupling is inevitable in a rotated gantry in which the horizontal plane is not the symmetry plane of the quadrupoles, it is possible to find a solution that the optics of the gantry“appears uncoupled” at any angular orientation of the gantry. As we show in the paper, the condition of an uncoupled gantry is equivalent to an uncoupled linear-beam-transport-matrix which is independent of the angular orientation of the <b>gantry,</b> therefore the <b>beam</b> spot size at the location of the tumor is independent of the orientation of the gantry. In this paper we present the theoretical basis to generate the beam optics for a gantry which is constrained to provide uncoupled and also achromatic beamtransport to the location of the tumor. In addition we present the layout of the magnetic elements and the optics of a medical gantrywhich satisfies the achromaticity and uncoupled conditions...|$|R
40|$|A Helical Tomotherapy (HT) Hi-Art II machine, Hi ART (TomoTherapy, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) was {{installed}} at our center in July 2007, {{and was the}} first machine in India. Image-guided HT is a new modality for delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Dosimetric tests done include (a) primary beam alignment (b) secondary beam alignment (c) water tank measurements (profiles and depth doses) (d) dose rate measurements (e) IMRT verification, and (f) Mega voltage Computed Tomography (MVCT) dose. Primary and secondary beam alignment revealed an acceptable linear accelerator (linac) alignment in both X and Y axes. In addition, it was observed that the beam was aligned in the same plane as gantry and the jaws were not twisted with respect to <b>gantry.</b> The rotational <b>beam</b> stability was acceptable. Multi-leaf collimators (MLC) were found to be stable and properly aligned with the radiation plane. The jaw alignment during gantry rotation was satisfactory. Transverse and longitudinal profiles were in good agreement with the "Gold" standard. During IMRT verification, the variation between the measured and calculated dose for a particular plan at the central and off-axis was found to be within 2 &#x 0025; and 1 mm in position, respectively. The dose delivered during the TomoImage scan was found to be 2. 57 cGy. The Helical Tomotherapy system is mechanically stable and found to be acceptable for clinical treatment. It is recommended that the output of the machine should be measured on a daily basis to monitor the fluctuations in output...|$|R
40|$|In metastatic brain lesions treatment, stereotac-tic {{radiation}} therapy represents a valid alternative to surgery, which indication {{is limited to}} single lesions, in accessible brain sites and in patients presenting an optimal performance status. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a novel method for delivering fractionated stereotactic in-tensity-modulated radiotherapy. We present treat-ment parameters, dosimetry analysis, and prelimi-nary clinical outcome. The method incorporates high-precision invasive fixation and reduced dimen-sion pencil beams. In our hospital, since January 2008 Hypofraction-ated Stereotactic Radiation Therapy is performed using Serial Tomotherapy with Nomostat ® System, connected to a 6 MV Linac. This system realizes an IMRT with dynamic <b>gantry</b> and a <b>beam</b> modulation by a binary multileaf collimator (MIMiC ® multi-vane intensity-modulating collimator) attached to the Linac head. During gantry rotation, collimator automatically modifies its morphology following target shape. In treatment of lesion smaller than 1, 5 cm, a post-collimation device called Beak ® pro-vides leaves opening limitation to 4 mm, allowing an high dose conformation around the target and an high dose fall-off in surrounding healthy tissues. For stereotactic {{radiation therapy}} in brain malignan-cies, we use Talon ® immobilization device, a mini-mally invasive system which consists in two tita-nium screws fixed in patient scalp; this device, making the patient in solidarity with the couch, pro-vides high accuracy in his positioning during radio-therapy sessions. In our experience, the technique has proven to be easy in implementation and highly reliable, allow-ing accurate repositioning in the hypofractionated treatments...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{potential}} dosimetric advantages and drawbacks of photon beams (modulated or not), electron beams (EB), and protons as a boost for the tumor bed in deep-seated early-stage breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Planning CTs of 14 women with deep-seated tumors (i. e., ≥ 4 cm depth) were selected. The clinical target volume (CTV) {{was defined as}} the area of architectural distortion surrounded by surgical clips. The planning treatment volume (PTV) was the CTV plus 1 cm margin. A dose of 16 Gy in 2 Gy fractions was prescribed. Organs at risk (OARs) were heart, lungs, breasts, and a 5 -mm thick skin segment on the breast surface. Dose-volume metrics were defined to quantify the quality of concurrent treatment plans assessing target coverage and sparing of OAR. The following treatment techniques were assessed: photon beams with either static 3 D-conformal, dynamic arc (DCA), static <b>gantry</b> intensity-modulated <b>beams</b> (IMRT), or RapidArc (RA); a single conformal EB; and intensity-modulated proton beams (IMPT). The goal for this planning effort was to cover 100 % of the CTV with 95 % of the prescribed dose and to minimize the volume inside the CTV receiving > 107 % of the dose. RESULTS: All techniques but DCA and EB achieved the planning objective for the CTV with an inhomogeneity ranging from 2 % to 11 %. RA showed the best conformity, EB the worst. Contra-lateral breast and lung were spared by all techniques with mean doses < 0. 5 Gy (zero for protons). The ipsi-lateral lung received a mean dose < 10 % of that prescribed with photon beams and < 2 % with IMPT, increasing to 17 % with EB. The heart, in left-sided breast tumors, received also the highest dose with EB. The skin was best protected with RA with a mean dose of 5. 4 Gy and V(15 Gy) = 2. 4 %. CONCLUSIONS: Boosting the tumor bed in early-stage breast cancer with optimized photon or proton beams may be preferred to EB especially for deep-seated targets. The marked OAR (i. e., ipsi-lateral breast, lung, heart, and skin surface) dose-sparing effect may allow for a potential long-term toxicity risk reduction and better cosmesis. DCA or RA may also be considered alternative treatment options for patients eligible for accelerated partial breast irradiation trials...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to assess the angular dependence of a commercial optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD) dosimetry system in MV x-ray beams at depths beyondd max and to find ways to mitigate this dependence for measurements in phantoms. Methods Two special holders were designed which allow a dosimeter to be rotated around the center of its sensitive volume. The dosimeter's sensitive volume is a disk, 5 mm in diameter and 0. 2 mm thick. The first holder rotates the disk in the traditional way. It positions the disk perpendicular to the <b>beam</b> (<b>gantry</b> pointing to the floor) in the initial position (0 °). When the holder is rotated the angle of the disk towards the beam increases until the disk is parallel with the beam (“edge on,” 90 °). This is referred to as Setup 1. The second holder offers a new, alternative measurement position. It positions the disk parallel to the beam for all angles while rotating around its center (Setup 2). Measurements with five to ten dosimeters per point were carried out for 6 MV at 3 and 10 cm depth. Monte Carlo simulations using GEANT 4 were performed to simulate the response of the active detector material for several angles. Detector and housing were simulated in detail based on microCT data and communications with the manufacturer. Various material compositions and an all-water geometry were considered. Results For the traditional Setup 1 the response of the OSLD dropped on average by 1. 4...|$|R
