25|$|A {{direct current}} flows uniformly {{throughout}} the cross-section of a uniform wire. An alternating current of any frequency is forced {{away from the}} wire's center, toward its outer surface. This is because the acceleration of an electric charge in an alternating current produces waves of electromagnetic radiation that cancel the propagation of electricity {{toward the center of}} materials with high conductivity. This phenomenon is called skin effect. At very high frequencies the current no longer flows in the wire, but effectively flows {{on the surface of the}} wire, within a thickness of a few skin depths. The skin depth is the thickness at which the current density is reduced by 63%. Even at relatively low frequencies used for power transmission (50Hz – 60Hz), non-uniform distribution of current still occurs in sufficiently thick conductors. For example, the skin depth of a copper conductor is approximately 8.57mm at 60Hz, so high current conductors are usually hollow to reduce their mass and cost. Since the current tends to flow in the periphery of conductors, the effective cross-section of the conductor is reduced. This increases the effective AC resistance of the conductor, since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. The AC resistance often is many times higher than the <b>DC</b> <b>resistance,</b> causing a much higher energy loss due to ohmic heating (also called I2R loss).|$|E

The <b>DC</b> flow <b>resistance</b> data from perforated sheets were found to correlate strongly with the grazing flow Mach number and the face-sheet porosity.

The increase in resistance with grazing flow for punched aluminum sheets is in good agreement with published results up to Mach 0. 4, but is significantly larger than expected above Mach 0. 4.

[...] Until 2000, the cars were kept in storage near Wayne Junction. Although there were plans to convert the cars into locomotive-hauled coaches, SEPTA finally decided to dispose of the fleet due to the expense it would have taken to deal with PCBs in the transformers and the lack of ADA compliance.

2500|$|There are, however, {{components}} of electrical circuits {{which do not}} obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their I–V curve) is nonlinear (or non-ohmic). [...] An example is the p-n junction diode (curve at right). [...] As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode. [...] One can determine a value of current (I) for a given value of applied voltage (V) from the curve, but not from Ohm's law, since the value of [...] "resistance" [...] is not constant {{as a function of}} applied voltage. [...] Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative. [...] The ratio V/I for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the static, or chordal, or <b>DC,</b> <b>resistance,</b> but as seen in the figure the value of total V over total I varies depending on the particular point along the nonlinear curve which is chosen. [...] This means the [...] "DC resistance" [...] V/I at some point on the curve {{is not the same as}} what would be determined by applying an AC signal having peak amplitude ΔV volts or ΔI amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring ΔV/ΔI. However, in some diode applications, the AC signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the dynamic, small-signal, or incremental resistance, defined as the one over the slope of the V–I curve at the average value (DC operating point) of the voltage (that is, one over the derivative of current with respect to voltage). [...] For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm's law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the V-I curve at the DC operating point.|$|E
