40|$|The Petite Amateur Navy Satellite (PANSAT) {{is a small}} {{communications}} satellite being developed at the Naval Postgraduate School. This thesis provides a structural design and analysis for the <b>adapter</b> <b>fitting</b> which mates PANSAT to the space shuttle Get Away Special (GAS) cannister launching system. Launch vehicle loading and interface requirements were combined with PANS AT design priorities to determine design specifications. Structural Dynamics Research Corporation's 1 -DEAS Masters Series software was utilized to model two adapter designs. The finite element solver in 1 -DEAS was {{used to analyze the}} two designs for strength and natural frequency. Design and analysis of fasteners, used to attach the <b>adapter</b> <b>fitting</b> to PANSAT, were also conducted. The results showed that a titanium alloy adapter, which does not shadow the solar arrays, and stainless steel fasteners exceeded all design specifications. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
50|$|A trickle ring is a {{circular}} drip irrigation device which evenly distributes water {{around the base}} of a tree or shrub. Connected to a water supply by a garden hose or tubing <b>adapter</b> <b>fitting,</b> trickle rings may be integrated into an irrigation network which waters many plants at the same time. By regulating the flow of water through the trickle ring, soil can be saturated at a rate which conserves water by minimizing wasteful surface runoff and losses due to evaporation.|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{standardized}} methods in use to attach the hose or tube to the component. Some are intended for ease of use and service, others are better for higher system pressures or control of leakage. The most common method, in general, is to provide in each component a female-threaded port, on each hose or tube a female-threaded captive nut, and use a separate <b>adapter</b> <b>fitting</b> with matching male threads to connect the two. This is functional, economical to manufacture, and easy to service.|$|R
2500|$|In 2009 Peterson Tuners {{released}} a VirtualStrobe tuner as an end-user application add-on for Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch where the application is bought cheaply as a download and installed. There exists a special 1/4" [...] TRS <b>jack</b> <b>adapter</b> for connecting an electric instrument to the iPhone, a notable achievement in strobe tuner technology, {{which has made}} such tuning widely available. In order to use it, however, a compatible iPod or iPhone must already be on hand.|$|R

50|$|The Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter {{allows the}} use of {{headsets}} with 3.5 millimeter headphone jacks with the original Xbox One controller, which didn't include the 3.5 mm <b>jack.</b> An <b>adapter</b> for 2.5 millimeter headphone jacks (except for ones with a dongle-like adapter) is also included.|$|R
50|$|Version 1.0 RCX bricks {{feature a}} power <b>adapter</b> <b>jack</b> to allow {{continuous}} operation {{instead of the}} limited operation time when using batteries. In version 2.0 (as well as later 1.0s included in the RIS 1.5), the power <b>adapter</b> <b>jack</b> was removed. Power adapter equipped RCX bricks are popular for stationary robotics projects (such as robot arms) or for controlling Lego model trains. In the latter context, the RCX needs to be programmed with Digital Command Control (DCC) software to operate multiple wired trains.|$|R
50|$|The 3.5mm TRRS {{connector}} for {{the headphones}} {{is located on}} the top left corner of the device for the first five generations (original through 4S), after which time it was moved to the bottom left corner. The headphone socket on the 1st-generation iPhone is recessed into the casing, making it incompatible with most headsets without the use of an adapter. Subsequent generations eliminated the problem by using a flush-mounted headphone socket. Cars equipped with an auxiliary jack allow handsfree use of the iPhone while driving as a substitute for Bluetooth. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have no 3.5mm headphone jack, and instead headsets must connect to the iPhone by Bluetooth, use Apple's Lightning port (which has replaced the 3.5mm headphone jack), or (for traditional headsets) use the Lightning to 3.5mm headphone <b>jack</b> <b>adapter,</b> which is included with all iPhone and 7 Plus units, and plugs into the Lightning port.|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{proposed}} by a startup company from downtown San Luis Obispo called BaseRock. BaseRock sells a backpack containing subwoofers {{to allow the}} user to feel low frequencies of music. It is intended for concerts or personal use, listening to songs on an MP 3. The main way the BaseRock backpack communicates with MP 3 s is via the headphone jack. With {{the introduction of the}} Apple iPhone 7 in September of 2016, BaseRock realized it was at a disadvantage. Millions of iPhone 7 owners and potential customers around the globe would no longer possess a headphone jack. BaseRock needs a Bluetooth-to-headphone <b>jack</b> <b>adapter</b> for its product to be competitive in the post iPhone 7 market. The module described by this report is able to pair to both an MP 3 and to Bluetooth headphones. The device takes music data from the phone/MP 3, passes it to the backpack subwoofers, and also to user headphones. Design challenges include compact size, internal power, and simultaneous signal outputs...|$|R
5000|$|RCA Audio adapter {{allows users}} to connect {{directly}} from the Xbox 360 console to supported stereo systems via RCA connectors. It Also includes an optical output jack and 3.5 or 1/8" [...] headphone <b>jack.</b> This <b>adapter</b> {{allows users to}} run audio directly from their console to their home stereo system in order to eliminate the high latency that comes with running audio through an HDMI adapter to TV speakers.|$|R
50|$|A shower {{radio is}} a {{battery-powered}} radio that is waterproofed {{to allow it}} to be used in a bathroom or other wet environment. Some versions also include a CD player and/or a clock. Shower radios generally lack headphone <b>jacks</b> and AC <b>adapter</b> ports, which could short out or electrocute the user. For the same reason, they also tend to lack external antennas.|$|R
50|$|The {{keyboard}} itself weighs 10.14 lbs and is 37.36 x 13.78 x 4.02 mm. The jacks on {{the rear}} of the keyboard consist of a 12V DC <b>adapter</b> <b>jack,</b> a phones/output jack, 1/8‚Äù audio line input jack, sustain/assignable jack, and a Class Compliant USB MIDI port. In addition to the DC adapter, 6 AA batteries {{can also be used to}} power the keyboard. A sampling feature is available, which utilizes the audio in jack. It changes pitch and tempo, instead of just changing pitch, so it produces a similar effect to tape recorder.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s Morley {{reduced the}} housing and treadle {{size of their}} pedals {{significantly}} and eventually changed the chassis to black. 9VDC battery power with an AC <b>adapter</b> <b>jack</b> (wall-wart jack) became standard as Morley pedals evolved {{in an effort to}} compete with the new compact pedals from companies like Boss, Ibanez, and DOD. Morley also manufactured some small non-treadle style effects for a while. Morley was sold to a Chicago based firm, Sound Enhancements, Inc., in 1989. The modern Morley company continues to use the electro-optical circuitry and basic pedal layout pioneered by Raymond and Marvin Lubow in the 1960s, albeit with some refinements. Original Morley pedals were strictly AC powered, whereas the current models are powered by a 9V battery with AC adapter capability. Tel-Ray Morleys used a small light-bulb to drive the LDRs; modern Morleys use LEDs.|$|R
5000|$|The PSP's default {{battery life}} varies widely {{depending}} on application {{from less than}} 3 hours while accessing a wireless network and having screen brightness on its highest setting to more than 11 hours during MP3 playback with the screen turned off. An extended-life 2200 mAh battery will increase this by approximately 20%. A sleep mode is also available that uses minimal battery power to keep the system's RAM active, allowing for [...] "instant on" [...] functionality. A system in sleep mode (with a fully charged battery) {{has been shown to}} lose an average of only 1% battery life per 24-hour period. The PSP-1000 series is equipped with a two-pin docking connector immediately below the AC <b>adapter</b> <b>jack</b> for easy drop in charging using a docking station that was to be sold separately. However no such dock was ever released by Sony, and therefore are absent from the PSP-2000 and later versions.|$|R
500|$|The Dream's {{exterior}} uses a soft, matte plastic shell, and {{was made}} available in white, black, and bronze colors. The Dream's design features a distinctive [...] "chin" [...] on the bottom, which houses 5 navigation buttons ("Call", [...] "Home", [...] "Menu", [...] "Back", and [...] "End Call") and a clickable trackball {{in the center}} {{which can be used}} for scrolling and selecting. The device uses a [...] capacitive touchscreen LCD at a resolution of 320√ó480; the screen can be slid along a curved hinge to expose a five-row QWERTY keyboard‚Äîas the first releases of Android did not include a virtual keyboard, the keyboard was originally the only method of text input on the device. While supporting multitouch at the hardware level, the Linux kernel in the Dream's Android distribution was patched to remove multitouch support from its touchscreen drivers for undisclosed reasons. The Dream does not include a traditional headphone <b>jack,</b> requiring an <b>adapter</b> for HTC's proprietary (but Mini-USB compatible) [...] "ExtUSB" [...] port located {{on the bottom of the}} device. The rear of the device houses a 3.15-megapixel rear camera with auto-focus.|$|R
5000|$|If {{it is not}} {{practical}} to run new cables, it is often still possible to split the telephone line {{at the point of}} entry in some cases. If Category 3 cable, Category 4 cable, or Category 5 cable was used to wire the premises and at least one pair of wires in the cable is unused, a [...] "whole house" [...] DSL filter can be installed at the point of entry, usually a Network Interface Device (NID) box. Although an in-line filter could be used for this purpose, special whole-house filters are available to make the installation easier. The wire pair that connects to telephones and fax machines is connected to the telephone company feed through the filter, while the wire pair that connects to the DSL modem is connected directly to the telephone company feed, unfiltered. At the wall jack where the DSL modem is installed a commercial 2-line splitter adapter is used that puts each line of the cable on its own jack port, connected as Line 1. The telephone, if any, is plugged into the Line 1 jack and the DSL modem is plugged into the Line 2 <b>jack</b> of the <b>adapter,</b> but is fed through the Line 1 contacts in that jack location. Due to the self-shielding nature of twisted wire pairs, this cable sharing technique works well for Category 4 and 5 cables, Since old-style Category 3 cables contain four parallel strands of wire, there is crosstalk and ADSL signal degradation between pairs, so cable sharing should be limited to 20 meters (65 ft), or so. This approach saves considerable money and labor, as the only changes to the premise wiring may occur at the NID and the only additional equipment needed is a 2-line splitter adapter. If the Line 2 wire pair was originally not connected at the wall jack where the DSL modem is to be used, {{it may be necessary to}} complete this step as well.|$|R
