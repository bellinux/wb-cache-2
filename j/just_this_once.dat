25|$|The {{publication}} of <b>Just</b> <b>This</b> <b>Once</b> raised {{questions in the}} legal profession concerning how copyright law applies to computer-generated works derived from an analysis of other copyrighted works, and whether the generation of such works infringes on copyright. The publications on this topic suggested that the copyright laws of the time were ill-equipped to deal with computer-generated creative works.|$|E
25|$|On the {{strength}} of this production, Warner Brothers signed Reinhardt to direct a filmed version, Hollywood's first Shakespeare movie since Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford's Taming of the Shrew in 1929. Rooney (Puck) and De Havilland (Hermia and Zara) were the only holdovers from the Hollywood Bowl cast. James Cagney starred, in his only Shakespearean role, as Bottom. Other actors in the film who played Shakespearean roles <b>just</b> <b>this</b> <b>once</b> included Joe E. Brown and Dick Powell. Erich Wolfgang Korngold was brought from Austria to arrange Mendelssohn's music for the film. He not only used the Midsummer Night's Dream music but also several other pieces by Mendelssohn. Korngold went on to make a Hollywood career, remaining in the US after Nazi Germany annexed Austria.|$|E

2500|$|The novel {{received}} some positive early reviews. In USA Today, novelist Thomas Gifford compared <b>Just</b> <b>This</b> <b>Once</b> to another novel {{in the same}} genre, American Star by Jackie Collins. Gifford concluded: [...] "If you do like this stuff, you'd be much, much better off with the one written by the computer." [...] The Dead Jackie Susann Quarterly declared that Susann [...] "would be proud. Lots of money, sleaze, disease, death, oral sex, tragedy and the good girl gone bad." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Just</b> <b>This</b> <b>Once</b> is a 1993 romance novel {{written in}} the style of Jacqueline Susann by a Macintosh IIcx {{computer}} named [...] "Hal" [...] in collaboration with its programmer, Scott French. French reportedly spent $40,000 and 8 years developing an artificial intelligence program to analyze Susann's works and attempt to create a novel that Susann might have written. A legal dispute between the estate of Jacqueline Susann and the publisher resulted in a settlement to split the profits, and the book was referenced in several legal journal articles about copyright laws. The book had two small print runs totaling 35,000 copies, receiving mixed reviews.|$|E

However, in the first round Mr. Le Pen received the most votes with 23.67% versus Mr. Chirac who had only 18.99% and Socialist Party candidate Lionel Jospin with <b>just</b> 14.49%. <b>This</b> was <b>once</b> again apparent in 2007 where Nicolas Sarkozy received 30.57% in the first round while Segolene Royal took 22.08%.

50|$|The 2006-07 season saw Jol end Tottenham's lengthy hoodoo against Chelsea with a win, {{the first}} {{against them in}} the league since 1990. In the Football League Cup, they were knocked-out in the semi-finals by rivals Arsenal. A 4-0 FA Cup win away to Fulham, however, kick-started a run of form which saw Tottenham take 27 points from their final 12 league games, losing <b>just</b> <b>once.</b> <b>This</b> run saw Spurs surge into fifth place, {{securing}} UEFA Cup qualification {{on the final day}} of the season, making Jol the first Spurs manager since Keith Burkinshaw to qualify for European football in successive seasons.

40|$|A new Self-Organizing Map is {{proposed}} for information parallel processing purpose. In this model, Parallel-SOM, {{there are two}} separate layers of neurons connected together. The number of neurons in both layer and connections between them {{is equal to the}} number of total elements of input signals. The weight updating is managed through a sequence of operations among some unitary transformation and operation matrixes. So the conventional repeated learning procedure is modified to learn <b>just</b> <b>once.</b> <b>This</b> research presents an algorithm developed to realize this new learning method. With a typical classification example, the performance of Parallel-SOM demonstrated convergence results similar to Kohonen's model. Theoretic analysis and proofs also show some interesting properties of Parallel-SOM. As the paper pointed out, in classical computation sense, the contribution of such a network may not be so significant. But its parallel mode may be interesting for quantum computation...|$|R
30|$|Temporal patterns, as {{given by}} the {{lifetime}} Δt of a cascade, follow a similar trend: most cascades die out after 24 hours, which closely resembles previously reported results [8]. However, in Figure  3 (upper panels) we observe a richer distribution (compared to topological penetration Δr) such that cascades may last over 100 days, suggesting that the survival of a conversation does not exhibit an obvious pattern. Again, this result confirms - from {{a different point of}} view - empirical results published elsewhere [11, 19]. Finally, the duration of cascades takes into account the fact that a node may participate multiple times in a single cascade - although it is counted <b>just</b> <b>once.</b> <b>This</b> is implicit in the definition of a time-constrained cascade, which comprehends self-sustained activity. In any case, Figure  3 (lower panels) illustrates that survival can not guarantee system-wide cascades, although an increasing pattern is observed as survival time grows.|$|R

A new addition compare to the previous season was that the fourth placed team from each division would play the fifth placed in the opposite group to determine the last two places in the second round. The six teams not qualified for the Qualifikationsphase entered the DRV-Pokal, the German rugby union cup, together with the top eight teams of the 2nd Bundesliga.

40|$|AbstractSingle sign-on (SSO) is a {{mechanism}} {{that uses a}} single action of authentication to permit an authorized user to access all related, but independent software systems or applications without being prompted to log in again at each of them during a particular session.

50|$|Generally {{in a race}} of the Barrachi type, {{the changes}} are very rapid, with stints {{of no more than}} 300 yards.

Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things I have ever seen in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years' association with the sport - something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front - and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front.
