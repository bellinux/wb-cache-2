50|$|It was whilst {{studying}} at Namgyal Ling that Beru attained <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill,</b> {{not only in}} Thangka painting, but also in associated monastic disciplines such as ritual music, and Lama dancing in particular. In 1956, after over 30 years of living at the monastery, Beru left for Lhasa, where he stayed for three years, until forced to escape to India following the invasion of Tibet by Chinese forces.Once in India, Beru began thangka painting again, based {{for a while in}} Dalhousie where, amongst other works, he was commissioned by Lokesh Chandra to produce a series of drawings of mandalas for publication. He was then asked by the 16th Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, to make his way to Scotland where Chogyam Trungpa and Akong Tulku Rinpoche had established the first Tibetan Buddhist centre in the west, Kagyu Samye Ling, in Eskdalemuir, Dumfriesshire. Despite having some initial misgivings about leaving the Tibetan community in exile in Northern India so soon after having arrived as a refugee, Beru acceded to the wishes of his Guru.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Talents that {{selectively}} {{facilitate the}} acquisition of <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> {{are said to be}} present in some children but not others. The evidence for this includes biological correlates of specific abilities, certain rare abilities in autistic savants, and the seemingly spontaneous emergence of exceptional abilities in young children, but there is also contrary evidence indicating an absence of early precursors of high skill levels. An analysis of positive and negative evidence and arguments suggests that differences in early experiences, preferences, opportunities, habits, training, and practice are the real determinants of excellence...|$|E

We contrast experimental market entry decisions where payoffs depend on skill {{as opposed to}} combinations of skill and chance. Our data show differential attitudes toward chance by those whose self-assessed skills are low and high. Making chance more important induces greater optimism for the former who start taking more risk, while the latter maintain a belief that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> are sufficient to overcome the vagaries of chance. Finally, although we observed “excess entry ” (i. e., too many participants entered markets), this could not be attributed to overconfidence...|$|E

In this paper we measure this effect in Catalonia, where two languages, Catalan and Spanish, coexist. Using census data for 1991 and 1996, and controlling for endogeneity of Catalan knowledge, we find that proficiency in speaking, reading and writing Catalan reinforces selection into communication intensive jobs/positions such as entrepreneurial, trade, and service activities; white-collar occupations; and permanent employment. Interestingly, the effect of language on occupational selection is stronger for women than for men. occupational selection, language, labor markets...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a profound}} paradox in current {{thinking on the}} process of globalisation. The paradox is this: many commentators, particularly those living in Anglo-Saxon countries, see one of the main likely outcomes of globalisation as being the triumph of the Ango-Saxon business model of shareholder value capitalism and its dominance over other models of capitalism. At the same time, there is a widespread belief that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> and advanced people management system that embraces high performance methods of organising work will be the key to business success in the 21 st century. However, a considerable body of research indicates that the Anglo-Saxon model of management, coupled with its interaction with financial systems and consumer markets, renders it extremely difficult to adopt this high performance workplace model or to invest in <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> for the bulk of the workforce. This paper explores these issues. It looks at the degree to which globalisation has come {{to be associated with the}} spread of the Ango-Saxon business model; and examines the parallel model of the high performance, high skill workplace, adoption of which bodies such as the OECD have suggested is the only means of securing competitiveness in a globalised economy. The paper then explores the central paradox, that the high performance, high skills model is apparently hard to nurture within an Anglo-Saxon business environment, and seeks to suggest why many UK firms find it hard to do what they are repeatedly told is good for them. The final section suggests some possible consequences, in terms of both what impact adoption of the Ango-Saxon model might have on the skills and IR systems of other developed countries, and, conversely, what impact their adoption and modification of selected elements of the Anglo-Saxon business model might have on the UK and USA...|$|E
