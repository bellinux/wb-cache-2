5000|$|Ron Rivest, cryptographer, co-creator of the RSA standard, and Gary Kildall, {{pioneering}} {{author of}} the CP/M operating system. [...] "Along with Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, Ronald L. Rivest is perhaps best known as an inventor of the RSA public-key cryptosystem," [...] wrote Dr. Dobb's editor Jonathan Erickson. [...] "The RSA cryptosystem has {{formed the basis of}} a variety of security-related tools from RSA Data Security, a company Ron helped launch. Ron currently serves as a director of the company. RSA software is generally acknowledged as one of the leading commercially available crypto and security toolsets, and has been adopted by third-party software companies worldwide." [...] Computer-industry pioneer Gary Kildall, Erickson wrote, had the kind of career [...] "of which legends are made." [...] Dr. Dobb's credited Kildall with the introduction of operating systems with preemptive multitasking, windowing capabilities, and menu-driven user interfaces; creating the first <b>floppy-disk</b> <b>track</b> buffering scheme, read-ahead algorithms, file directory caches, and RAM disk emulators; defining the first programming language and writing the first compiler specifically for microprocessors; creating the first microprocessor disk operating system; creating the first computer interface for video disks to allow automatic nonlinear playback, presaging today's interactive multimedia; developing the file system and data structures for the first consumer CD-ROM; creating the first successful open system architecture by segregating system-specific hardware interfaces in a set of BIOS routines, ushering in the third-party software industry; and creating the CP/M operating system.|$|E
