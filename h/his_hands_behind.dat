5|$|No {{images of}} Murrell survive. Accounts {{describe}} him as a short man who walked with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his back and hummed as he went. He was also noted for wearing a hard hat, bobbed tale coat, and iron goggles, while carrying a whalebone umbrella and a basket into which he placed the herbs that he collected. His appearance reportedly scared local children, of whom he was nevertheless fond.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} between Bad News Brown and Ken Patera. Before the bell rang, however, Brown {{attacked}} Patera, who retaliated by performing a clothesline from the corner. Patera then slipped {{both of his}} arms underneath Brown's armpits and locked <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his neck, using a submission move known as a full nelson. At {{the end of the}} match, Brown defeated Patera by striking him {{in the back of the}} head with his finishing move, the Ghetto Blaster.|$|E
25|$|After Scott {{was shot}} and had dropped to the ground, Slager {{approached}} him, repeatedly instructed him to place <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his back, and handcuffed him, leaving him {{face down on the}} ground. Although police reports stated that officers performed CPR on Scott, no such action is visible on the video. The video shows that Slager ran back toward where the initial scuffle occurred and picked something up off the ground. Moments later, he dropped the object, possibly the Taser, beside Scott's body.|$|E

500|$|The younger alternate-timeline Spock. Quinto {{expressed}} interest in the role because of the duality of Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan heritage, and how [...] "he is constantly exploring that notion of how to evolve in a responsible way and how to evolve in a respectful way. I think those are all things {{that we as a}} society, and certainly the world, could implement." [...] He mentioned he heard about the new film and revealed his interest in the role in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; the article was widely circulated and he attracted Abrams' interest. For the audition, Quinto wore a blue shirt and flattened his hair down to feel more like Spock. He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows, and grew and dyed his hair for the role. He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his back. Quinto commented that the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking [...] "I just felt like a nerd. I felt like I was 12 again. You look back at those pictures and you see the bowl cut. There's no question I was born to play the Spock role. I was sporting that look for a good four or five years. The film officially establishes (to Kirk's surprise) that Uhura and Spock are lovers and have been romantically linked for some time, a point which had never been previously explored on TV or in film." [...] Adrien Brody had discussed playing the role with the director before Quinto was cast.|$|E
2500|$|Johnny Cage parodies the [...] "here's Johnny" [...] {{scene as}} part of his {{fatality}} in Mortal Kombat X where he shoves <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> the opponent in which he then says the line by peeping his face through the opened torso.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, he fell [...] while showing {{students}} how to rely on their legs when climbing. He kept <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his back on an easy route but lost his balance and fell headfirst, shattering both wrists. He went into another coma and spent two months in the hospital.|$|E

2500|$|After leaving Parliament, Johnson {{continued}} {{as a local}} solicitor, and directed his political energies towards animal rights campaigning. He worked with Donald Chapman, a Labour MP, going to campaign against fox hunts, which outraged the huntsman. On 29 October 1959 the Southdown hunt with 14 hounds charged into Johnson's [...] garden at Ditchling in Sussex, wrecking the hedges and damaging crops. When one huntsman dismounted and advanced on Johnson brandishing his riding crop and threatening to [...] "teach him a lesson", Johnson urged the man to hit him and promised to keep <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his back if he did. Johnson remarked [...] "I told him it would suit me admirably if he hit me, as it would show others what hunting people are like." [...] Instead the man rode off.|$|E
2500|$|... "Officer Pirone {{directed}} Officer Mehserle {{to arrest}} {{two of the}} individuals {{who had not been}} handcuffed. One of the individuals to be arrested was Oscar Grant, and Officer Pirone’s direction to Mehserle was overheard by Grant. Grant, upon hearing that he was under arrest, attempted to stand up, but was forced to the ground face first. Both Officer Mehserle and Officer Pirone attempted to restrain Mr. Grant and to seek his compliance by ordering him to put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his back to be handcuffed, but Mr. Grant resisted and refused to submit to handcuffing. Officer Mehserle was pulling at Mr. Grant’s right hand and arm, which remained under his torso near his waistband. Mr. Grant had not been searched by any officer for weapons, neither prior to his initial detention nor after being seated near the wall." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the bedroom, Mueller noted {{there was}} indeed a large knife beneath the bed; he also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, {{contained}} scores of Polaroid pictures—many of which were of human bodies {{in various stages of}} dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the very apartment in which they were standing. He walked into the living room to show them to his partner, uttering the words, [...] "These are for real." [...] When Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf. As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers and muttered the words: [...] "For what I did I should be dead." ...|$|E

2500|$|The lower scene, {{in which}} the figures are less readily identifiable, [...] depicts the {{erection}} of a tropaion. In some interpretations of the scene, all the lower figures are by design anonymous. [...] Other interpretations attribute definite real or mythological persons to the figures. [...] At left, the seated male and female figures (combined in #11) are either Celts or Germans, as is apparent from their clothing and hair styles, including the man's beard, and represent prisoners of war, symbolizing the Roman victory. [...] The man is bound with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> his back, and both are apparently about to be tied {{to the base of}} the as yet half-erected tropaion (figure #19_, a trophy of war displayed upon winning a battle, usually fixed into the ground at the position of the [...] "turning-point" [...] of the battle in favour of the victors. [...] The trophy consists of a wooden cross, designed to support human clothing. [...] A helmet is placed on top, and the breastplate and weaponry of the enemy is placed upon it. [...] In the scene, four young men are raising the trophy into a vertical position. [...] Figure #18 is the least identifiable, but his helmet [...] has led some to believe that he may be a Macedonian soldier of King Rhoemetalces I, who helped Tiberius in Pannonia.|$|E

6000|$|Unc' {{poked his}} head a little farther out and put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> ear {{as if he were}} a little hard of hearing. [...] "What's that, Bre'r Rabbit? Am I a what?" [...] he demanded.|$|R
