40|$|A {{contracting}} consortium, {{comprising the}} Turkish contractor Asim-Alarko and the Dutch contractor Van Oord ACZ, has {{submitted to the}} Turkish Water Authority a new concept for an offshore fresh water pipeline between Turkey and Cyprus. Where conventional offshore pipelines are laid on the seabed and are made from steel, this new pipeline concept incorporates a submerged <b>floating</b> <b>pipeline</b> made from High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) which is anchored to the seabed by vertical anchor lines. This new concept could simplify the installation procedure of pipelines since the submerged <b>floating</b> <b>pipeline</b> will be anchored at a relatively limited depth below the sea level. This avoids the high forces resulting from installing a pipeline at great water depths and buckling due to external pressures. After previous feasibility studies the consortium requested Aker Kvaerner to perform detailed engineering for above-mentioned new pipeline concept. As {{a result of this}} the present study has been initiated to start with the global design of the concept, which has finally resulted in an extensive study of the following aspects: 9 ̆ 5 Study of the design parameters. 9 ̆ 5 Study of the hydraulics in the pipeline 9 ̆ 5 Study of the static behaviour of the proposed structure In the study of the design parameters it appears that especially some environmental data are difficult to quantify without doing an offshore survey; they are of great importance for the design. This concerns the marine growth at the relevant water depth, the magnitude and the direction of the deep-sea currents, the possible existence of internal waves and the soil properties. The properties of HDPE are also important for the design and therefore need accurate investigation, especially the stress-strain characteristics related to time and the creep behaviour of HDPE. Present material specifications appear to be not sufficient for final structural design. The pipeline must have the capacity to transport 75 million m 3 (2. 38 m 3 /s) of freshwater per year based on gravity flow. The hydraulic study showed that a pipeline with an internal diameter of 1. 48 [m] is needed. Wall-friction is the dominant cause of hydraulic losses in the pipeline. Friction losses owing to bends, valves, contractions and enlargements appear to be almost negligible. For further hydraulic design there are two aspects that need special attention. The first aspect is the possible occurrence of under-pressures near the coast of Cyprus during steady state flow in the pipeline. It is preferred to avoid these under-pressures; consequently, an adequate pressure control system will have to be designed. The second aspect, which needs extra attention, is surge. Closing operations of valves will initiate pressure waves. These pressure waves will have an important influence on the structural behaviour of the system. Investigation will be necessary to establish whether HDPE is able to withstand the related short-term loads or if a pressure release system is necessary. From the static analysis it appears that the configuration, as proposed by the contracting consortium, with a distance of 500 [m] between the vertical anchor lines should be technically feasible. However, local stress problems, which arise near the connection points of the vertical anchor lines, still have to be solved. It could even be necessary that in order to solve these problems small improvements in the original concept will have to be made. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Beach nourishments or sand replenishments {{are applied}} {{by the use}} of {{pipelines}} or the rainbow method. Replenished sand is then moved and levelled by bulldozers. This is a passive approach to process the outflow of material. The land based equipment is dependent from tides and water levels, and significant effort is required to install and maintain the onshore discharge pipeline. In remote (off-shore) areas mobilization of site equipment to move the sand may be quite a challenge. The ideal method considers an active approach regarding processing the outflow of material. Instead of distributing the settled material by site equipment, the pipeline out flow point has to be relocated such that the design could be constructed. To increase workability the pipeline must have the ability to be relocated in water as on land. Enabling this approach the pipeline system has to be displaced by some sort of means. The main problem is the rigid behavior of the pipeline. Displacement of the pipeline will result that the entire pipeline length has to be displaced. Assuming that in water relocation of a <b>floating</b> <b>pipeline</b> is not that difficult as floating equipment is able to reach the <b>floating</b> <b>pipeline.</b> When the pipeline is situated on land huge pull or push requirements follows when the pipeline needs displacing. Concepts both for depositing material as for delivering the material have been generated. The most promising method for depositing material is to apply a spray pontoon. By adding amphibious propulsion technique to the spray pontoon the pontoon is able to work on the interface between water and land. The most promising method regarding delivering material to the spray pontoon is by applying a steel pipeline. During depositing the spray pontoon have to be displaced frequently. Also the spray pontoon {{has to be able to}} displace the pipeline system. Properties of the pipeline system dictate the required amount of tractive effort that have to be generated by the spray pontoon. Focus is on maximizing the tractive effort to be generated by the spray pontoon. To decrease the amount of resistance the pipeline will be mounted on platforms. Focus is on minimizing the required amount effort to displace the pipeline system and by generating flexibility along the pipeline system. By generating flexibility along the pipeline system the pipeline could swing independently of each other. Production figures will determine the amount of flexibility needed along the pipeline system. It is technical feasible to apply an amphibious spray pontoon but a uniform concept doesn’t exist because there is a large amount of parameters and aspects involved. It depends on the type of project, and site conditions which type of platform have to be applied. On project locations were small variations of the water level is to be expected and the soil surface has high bearing capacities values platforms can be applied that have an interaction with the soil surface. However, on soft soils with low bearing capacity values the soil interaction platforms will experience significant sinkage; the resistance force to displace such platforms may possible not be generated by the spray pontoon. In addition on soft soil the spray pontoon is able to generate a smaller pull force compared to when on sandy soil surface. On (very) soft soils platforms that don’t have an interaction with the soil surface are advantageous compared to soil interaction platforms. Dredging Engineerin...|$|E

In this article we use a global production network (GPN) approach to examine the evolutionary dynamics of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector {{and its role in}} an emerging global market for natural gas. We extend recent work in the relational economic geography literature on the organizational practices by which production networks are assembled and sustained over time and space; and we address a significantly underdeveloped aspect of GPN research by demonstrating the implications of these practices for the territoriality of GPNs. The article introduces LNG as a techno-material reconfiguration of natural gas that enables it to be moved and sold beyond the continental limits of pipelines. We briefly outline the evolving scale and geographic scope of LNG trade, and introduce the network of firms, extraeconomic actors, and intermediaries through which LNG production, distribution, and marketing are coordinated. Our analysis shows how LNG is evolving from a relatively simple <b>floating</b> <b>pipeline</b> model of point-to-point, binational flows orchestrated by producing and consuming companies and governed by long-term contracts, to a more geographic and organizationally complex production network that is constitutive of an emergent global gas market. Empirically the article provides the first systematic analysis within economic geography of the globalization of the LNG sector and its influence on global gas markets, demonstrating the potential of GPN (and related frameworks) to contribute meaningful analysis of the contemporary political economy of energy. Conceptually the article pushes research on GPN to realize more fully its potential as an analysis of network territoriality by examining how the spatial configuration of GPNs emerges from the organizational structures and coordinating strategies of firms, extraeconomic actors and intermediaries; and by recognizing how network territoriality is constitutive of markets rather than merely responsive to them...|$|E

40|$|The eThekwini {{coastline}} is {{a vulnerable}} coastline subject to chronic erosion and damage due to sea level rise. In 2007 a severe storm caused major physical and economic damage along the coastline, proving {{the need for}} action. Umhlanga Rocks is a densely populated premium holiday destination on the eThekwini coastline suffering from similar problems due to its narrow beaches and lack of dunes in certain places. Interference with the coast of Umhlanga can entice fierce resistance from different groups of stakeholders, which makes finding a suitable solution more difficult. The above leads to the following problem definition: Due to erosion and extreme weather conditions the coastline of Umhlanga Rocks is shifting on shore, causing narrow beaches, decrease of tourism and increased risk of failures of the coastal structures. The current situation requires a new long term safety strategy, {{taking into account the}} social, economic and environmental vitality of the Umhlanga Rocks area as well. To solve the problem definition the main question states: How can the eThekwini municipality create a sustainable Umhlanga coastline while adding value to the area? To answer the main question many different elements, varying from conventional coastal protection measures to experimental ideas that would increase local business, were formulated during a brainstorm session. These elements are ranked on their cost, added value and technological feasibility. From the highest ranked elements in each category 11 different alternatives are created. By performing a multi criteria analysis these 11 alternatives are narrowed down to three alternatives and an additional `do nothing’ option is included. The do nothing option assumes that the beach will be completely gone in 30 - 40 years. It is further assumed Umhlanga Rocks recreational businesses are coupled to the beach and property values will drop by 12 % once the beach is gone. This gives a NPV of R. 15, 000, 000, 000. It is suspected that the equilibrium that normally exists in the cross shore sediment transport is disturbed and more sediment moves offshore than onshore. The sill is designed to prevent the sediment form moving too far offshore and thus to create a new equilibrium. The bar retaining sill consists of prefab concrete elements located just outside the surf zone. From the Delft 3 D model it followed that the beach stays roughly the same size after construction of the sill. The NPV bases the cost of the sill on reference projects. With the beach maintaining its current size the total NPV amounts to R. 116, 000, 000, 000. The nourishment option adds enough sand to the beach to compensate for erosion and add 15 meters of beach according to the Delft 3 D model. It is assumed the nearby sand depot can be used to perform the nourishment. The nourishment itself will be done using a dredger connected to a <b>floating</b> <b>pipeline</b> to pump the sand to the beach. Shovels will be used to divide the sand over the beach area. The cost of the nourishment is based on the cost of a similar project, with the benefit of the added beach area the total NPV is R. 142, 000, 000, 000. The submerged breakwater creates a calmer wave climate near the coast and will thereby reduce erosion and increase beach growth. The Delft 3 D model suggests an average beach growth of 20 meters. For the breakwater design different materials are considered. Geotextile systems look very promising and have several advantages over a rock or concrete breakwater. A design with geotextile bags and one with geotextile tubes is made for the Umhlanga Rocks area. The NPV of the breakwater amounts to R. 131, 000, 000, 000. A second multi criteria analysis is performed to determine the overall best option. According to this analysis the construction of a submerged breakwater made of geotextile tubes provides the best solution to the problem from social and technical preferences. Social preferences include perceptions of stakeholders involved like environmental groups and property owners, but take the construction and maintenance costs of the alternative into account as well. In this case the geotextile tube breakwater uses conforming materials, does not cause any visual horizon pollution and seems to deliver the best benefits for the price involved. At the same time the results from the 3 D simulations have shown that the breakwater is able to perform well on the technical preferences including the breakage of waves offshore and increase of beach width.
