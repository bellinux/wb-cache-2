40|$|Background: Walking for {{transport}} {{can contribute to}} the accrual of health-enhancing levels of physical activity in elders. Identifying destinations and environmental conditions that facilitate this type of walking has public health significance. However, most findings are limited to Western, low-density locations, while a larger proportion of the global population resides in ultra-dense Asian metropolises. We investigated relationships of within-neighborhood objectively-measured <b>destination</b> <b>categories</b> and environmental attributes with walking {{for transport}} in 484 elders from an ultra-dense metropolis (Hong Kong). Methods: We estimated relationships of diversity (number of different types) and prevalence of within-neighborhood <b>destination</b> <b>categories</b> (environmental audits of 400 m buffers surrounding residential addresses) with transport-related walking (interviewer–administered questionnaire) in 484 Chinese-speaking elders able to walk unassisted and living in 32 neighborhoods stratified by socio-economic status and transport-related walkability. We examined the moderating effects of safety and pedestrian infrastructure-related neighborhood attributes on destination-walking associations. Results: Participants reported on average 569 and 254 min/week of overall and within-neighborhood walking for transport, respectively. The prevalence of public transit points and diversity of recreational destinations were positively related to overall walking for transport. The presence of a health clinic/service and place of worship, higher diversity in recreational destinations, and greater prevalence of non-food retails and services, food/grocery stores, and restaurants in the neighborhood were predictive of more within-neighborhood walking for transport. Neighborhood safety-related aspects moderated the relationship of overall walking for transport with the prevalence of public transit points, this being positive only in safe locations. Similar moderating effects of safety-related attributes were observed for the relationships of within-neighborhood walking for transport with diversity of recreational and entertainment destinations. Pedestrian-infrastructure attributes acted as moderators of associations of within-neighborhood walking for transport with prevalence of commercial <b>destination</b> <b>categories.</b> Composite <b>destinations</b> indices consisting of <b>destination</b> <b>categories</b> related to the specific measures of walking were positively associated with walking for transport. Conclusions: The availability of both non-commercial and commercial destinations may promote within-neighborhood walking for transport, while recreational facilities and public transit points may facilitate overall walking for transport. However, destination-rich areas need to also provide adequate levels of personal safety and a physically-unchallenging pedestrian network...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aids in tackling {{one important}} part of accessibility metrics—measuring land use. It introduces complementary strategies to effectively measure {{a variety of different}} destination types at a highly detailed scale of resolution using secondary data. The research describes ways to overcome common data hurdles and demonstrates how existing data in one metropolitan area in the U. S. –the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul –can be exploited to aid in measuring accessibility at an extremely fine unit of analysis (i. e., the parcel). Establishment-level data containing attribute information on location, sales, employees, and industry classification was purchased from Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. The research process involved cleaning and tailoring the parcel dataset for the 7 -county metro area and integrating various GIS datasets with other secondary data sources. These data were merged with parcel-level land use data from the Metropolitan Council. The establishment-level data were then recoded into <b>destination</b> <b>categories</b> using the 2 to 6 -digit classifications of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The development of important components of this research is illustrated with a sample application.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} provides {{further insight}} into the well-researched question of whether and how job performance {{has an impact on}} employee turnover. Moreover, this study takes this relationship one step further by investigating the less researched area of turnover destinations, specifically whether turnover destination may impact the performance - turnover relationship. All of these relationships are studied in the South African business context, thereby providing an understanding of these constructs from a perspective that has been less researched in the literature. The research question that this study aims to answer is ‘does employee turnover to alternate destinations differ by performance’. The initial hypotheses proposed compare the relationship between job performance and employee turnover with the subsequent hypotheses looking at the impact of performance on different external turnover destinations. The destinations considered in this study concern moving to the same job in a different organisation, a different job in a different organisation and finally, leaving the workforce. The study follows a quantitative paradigm and uses a combination of archival records and a survey method to gather the data. A convenience sampling method was adopted and four organisations, all located in the Johannesburg region, were selected to participate in the study, based on accessibility to information. The final sample, which included stayers that were purposefully matched to leavers based on a number of criteria, consisted of 298 respondents. All respondents were white collar workers and professionals. 2 Various statistical techniques were employed to investigate the research question and the hypotheses that were put forward. Correlations, comparisons of means tests (ANOVA’s and t-tests) and multiple logistic regressions were the main statistical techniques that were adopted in this study. The results produced are in line with the findings of many other studies and show firstly that job performance does impact employee turnover such that higher performance levels are associated with lower levels of turnover. Furthermore, evidence was found to suggest that low performance made the destination choice of leaving the workforce or moving to a different job in a different organisation more likely. No significant results were found in respect of the relationship between job performance and the <b>destination</b> <b>category</b> of moving to the same job in a different organisation. The implications of such findings has an impact on the way in which businesses today manage and retain the high performing individuals in their organisations. With high performers being more likely to leave an organisation, managers need to increase the effort that they make to retain key employees that are pivotal in an organisation’s success. Furthermore, organisations need to implement initiatives that aim to manage the performance of poor performing individuals that are not contributing at an acceptable level...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The National Statistics School Leaver Destinations Survey collects information on what pupils are doing (their destination) three months after they have left publicly funded schools in Scotland. The Scottish Government has been running the survey since the academic year 1992 / 93. The main purpose of the data collection is for monitoring, to increase the proportion of school leavers in positive and sustained destinations and to directly inform the More Choices, More Chances policy agenda. A follow up survey of the same pupils is carried out approximately nine months after the pupil has left school to inform the Scottish Government’s National Performance Indicator on young people in positive and sustained destinations. Please note that the Follow Up School Leaver Destinations Survey also contains {{the data from the}} previous Initial School Leaver Destinations Survey. Therefore, you should apply for the Follow Up School Leaver Destinations Survey data if they have been released for the year that you are interested in researching. The National Statistics School Leaver Destination Survey covers all school leavers in Scottish publicly funded schools (where contactable) except special schools. Destinations of school leavers leaving independent schools are collected by the Scottish Government using a different survey and are not included in this dataset. Finally, school leavers that have moved outside of Scotland are not included in the survey. The survey was first collected in 1992 / 93, and data are available at an individual pupil level. The data collection method for both the initial and follow up survey is as follows. Each year, schools provide information on individual school leavers to their Local Authorities, who then forwarded this information to Careers Scotland. They then contact all school leavers (approximately 60, 000) by phone three months (initial survey) and nine months (follow up survey) after they have left school to ask the questions for these surveys. Data are then passed back to the Scottish Government for analysis and publication of results. A wide variety of information is collected on each pupil and includes their Scottish Candidate Number, date of birth, gender, home postcode, and <b>destination</b> <b>category.</b> The survey has been collected since 1992 / 93 but note the follow up survey started in 2006 / 07. Prior to 1992 / 1993, the Scottish Government did collect data on school destinations by carrying out similar cohort surveys. The data are collected in March of each year and normally available from June in the same year. A school leaver is classed as a young person of school leaving age who left school during or {{at the end of the}} school year, where the school year is taken to run from 1 August to 31 July. School leavers going onto voluntary work can be identified separately only from 2006 / 07. Prior to this they have been included with those unemployed and not seeking work. Figures for school leavers entering voluntary work destinations are generally less than 1 %. For the initial survey, around 5 % of school leavers from publicly funded schools in Scotland cannot be contacted because of changes in their circumstances or mistakes in their contact details. For the follow up survey six months later, another 5 % cannot be contacted for the same reason. In general, the Scottish Government collects a wide variety of educational data covering pupils, preschool children, teachers, schools, and free school meal eligibility. Further details are provided on the Scottish Government Education webpage. Research Usage and Linkage The National statistics School Leaver Destinations Survey has been used for a wide variety of research purposes including analysing school leaver with unemployment areas, gender with achievement, and trends in positive and negative pupil destinations over time. The survey has also been linked with the Scottish Government’s Pupil Census to provide a more in depth picture of pupils in Scotland, including the relationship between free school meals and pupil destinations. The National Statistics School Leaver Destination Survey contains the Scottish Candidate number (a unique number allocated to each pupil by the Scottish Qualifications Authority at Primary 1). In theory, this field will allow you to link to the other main Scottish Education datasets including the Pupil Census, Attendance and Absence survey, Exclusion Survey, and also the Scottish Qualification Authority attainment datasets. This dataset cannot be linked to the Free School Meals Survey. Consideration is also being given to linking the Scottish Government Education data with health data using probabilistic matching techniques. </div...|$|E

40|$|The twin {{starting}} points for this paper are recent discussions in economic theory concerning the normative foundations for indices of intergenerational mobility, {{and the development}} of a human capital score intended (in conjunction with a parallel measure of individual wealth) to act as an indicator of social class. The paper specifies an intergenerational Gini-type mobility index, based on the mean expected earnings of the children of fathers in each class. It makes a series of estimates of mobility in Britain from BHPS lifetime employment history files. The first of these uses the Goldthorpe three-category class schema for both origins and destinations; the resulting estimates suffer from (1) the systematic exclusion of those (particularly women) outside employment, and (2) the effects of the changes in the sizes of the class categories. The second estimation is a hybrid using Goldthorpe (seven category) origins and human capital quintile destination categories; this deals with problem (1) but not problem (2), The third estimation uses human capital quintiles for both origin and <b>destination</b> <b>categories,</b> and avoids both problems. But it is dominated by the fourth approach, a continuous version of the Gini index using scalar variables (the fathers' human capital scores and the children's expected earnings). The women's intergenerational Gini score now shows substantial increases from the 1935 - 44 birth cohort to the 1955 - 64 birth cohort; the men's score shows small increases over the same period. The conclusion is that in terms of this index, intergenerational mobility in Britain has become more unequal overall. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} range {{planning}} in fashion retailing is fundamentally different {{to that in}} fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) retailing {{because of the need}} for change in the product range. Fashion assortments intrinsically vary from season to season and often more frequently within the season. The concept of category management which is prevalent in the FMCG retailing has found limited application in the fashion sector (Dewsnap and Hart, 2004) primarily because category management involves the fine tuning of a product range over time. However, one of the underlying principles of the category management concept is the notion that different product categories can play unique roles in the pursuit of overall successful performance of a merchandise assortment. The category management literature describes five roles that product categories can play: cash-flow contributors, profit generators, brand reinforcement <b>categories,</b> <b>destination</b> <b>categories</b> and finally service providers. The extent to which these types of category are applicable to fashion retailers is not well known and it is proposed that the concept of the iconic category may be more appropriate for fashion retailers. The term brand coherence describes the relationship between existing and new products with the brand identity being central to the ability of a brand to communicate what its products and services have in common {{in order to create a}} clear image (Kapferer, 2008). In this context the paper also questions to what extent iconic merchandise categories can influence consumers’ purchasing behaviour and their perception of brands. Drawing upon case study research undertaken in the UK mid-market women’s clothing retail sector, this paper explores the adoption of roles within fashion merchandise planning in fashion brands and attempts to establish the characteristics of the role that iconic products and iconic categories might play in this process...|$|R

Think of the KFS as a personal assistant, who can file {{every one of you}} documents into multiple appropriate folders, so that when it comes time for you to retrieve a file, you can easily find it among any of the folders that are likely to contain it. Technically, KFS analyzes each file and hard links (which are simply pointers to a physical file on POSIX file systems) it to multiple <b>destination</b> directories (<b>categories).</b> The actual classification can be based on a combination of file content analysis, file usage analysis, and manually configured rules. Since the KFS organizes files using the familiar file/folder metaphor, it enjoys 3 key advantages against desktop search based solutions such as Google’s Desktop Search, namely 1) usability, 2) portability, and 3) compatibility. The KFS has been prototyped using the FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace) framework on Linux. Apache Lucene was used to provide traditional desktop search capability in the KFS. A machine learning text classifier was used as the KFS content classifier, complimenting the customizable rule-based KFS classification framework. Lastly, an embedded database is used to log all file access to support file-usage classification. virtual file system; search engine; personal information management; indexing; classification I...|$|R
40|$|Tourism {{is a vital}} {{economic}} activity in many countries. Cities, regions, countries and <b>destinations</b> of all <b>categories</b> vie for securing tourists {{and to do so}} they employ communication and promotion channels such as official websites. Despite the importance of these websites, no comprehensive method of assessment exists to enable communications managers and directors to find out whether their destination's website is effective and where it ranks in comparison to its competitors. This paper presents a hitherto unseen assessment system aimed at meeting this need. Using a host of indicators, grouped into twelve parameters, a Web Quality Index (WQI) has been specifically established for tourist destination websites which, as well as determining an overall index, makes it possible to draw comparison between parameters or spheres of analysis. The assessment system is illustrated using the result of a pilot sample of official websites from ten destinations to confirm the validity and potential of the model put forward...|$|R
