5|$|Mr. Burns withdraws a $1000 {{bill from}} an ATM, but he drops it and an updraft carries it {{away to the}} Simpsons' house, where it is found by Bart and Milhouse. Marge makes Bart and Homer put up fliers so {{that the person who}} lost the bill can reclaim it. No one can {{describe}} it correctly so Lisa suggests that they spend the money on a vacation, but then decide against it because Homer always manages to ruin any trip they go on. After realizing he can make money from the bill, Bart displays it in a museum in his tree house. Mr. Burns visits and reclaims his money, forcing Bart to close his museum. However, Bart has made over $3000 from the museum so they decide to spend the money on a vacation for Marge. Abraham Simpson suggests they go to Britain, where he hopes to meet his long-lost love Edwina. During World War II, he made love to her after claiming he was <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front lines the next day, not realising that he really was shipping out the next day (D-Day).|$|E
25|$|The oil {{industry}} moved {{most of its}} local operations offshore during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1947, offshore leases were approved by the federal government, and seismic exploration of the Channel {{took place in the}} 1950s, even though fishermen complained that the underwater explosions were killing fish. The first of the huge black fifteen-story oil platforms, a feature of the seascape south of Santa Barbara for fifty years, went up in 1958. During the period, Stearns Wharf was the main connection for oil services <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> platforms.|$|E

I had no money, so I went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so {{hard to be a}} writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.|$|E

25|$|Alms {{served in}} the navy from an early age, seeing his first actions in the Mediterranean and off the French coast, before <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> East Indies. He {{narrowly}} survived a shipwreck that claimed most of his shipmates, and returned to England shortly afterwards, having achieved the rank of lieutenant. He was briefly back in the East Indies for service {{during the early years}} of the Seven Years' War, before going to the West Indies in acting-command of a frigate. After being involved in a number of important actions in the Caribbean, he returned to Britain after the end of the war, and retired ashore. Returning to active service after the outbreak of the American War of Independence, he went out to the East Indies in command of his own ship. He saw action at most of the engagements between Sir Edward Hughes and the Bailli de Suffren, particularly distinguishing himself at the Battle of Providien. He retired ashore after the end of the war, and died in 1791.|$|E
25|$|In 1704 a {{group of}} farmers in Hurley petitioned the colonial governor, Viscount Cornbury, {{for some of the}} undeveloped land to their west along the creek to use as common pasture and firewood, since they were getting {{squeezed}} by Kingston to their east and Marbletown to the south. The petition was put off for several years while it was ostensibly being surveyed, and in 1706 a grant of 2million acres (8,000km2) was made to Johannes Hardenbergh and {{a group of}} investors starting from the same point along the Esopus near Kingston and <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Delaware River, taking not only all of Ulster County to the west but much of today's Delaware and Sullivan counties as well. The Hardenbugh Patent, as it became known, is the source of much of the land titles in the Catskills today, although its legitimacy was contested from the beginning, a dispute which continued until after the Revolution, aggravated by inadequate surveys of the region. Encumbrances remained on many properties into the 20th century.|$|E

2500|$|Elliot further {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} cutting out a French brig laden with naval stores {{from under the}} guns of a French shore battery at Belle Île on 17 May 1760. Aeolus was badly damaged during the action, and returned to port to be repaired. While these were being carried out {{it is possible that}} Elliot was temporarily appointed to command the 44-gun , aboard which he escorted an outward bound merchant convoy headed to the Baltic. [...] However, Elliot's records are often confused (or have been intermingled) with those of Captain John Eliot (17421769), who may have commanded Gosport instead. With this service completed, and repairs on Aeolus being finished, Elliot resumed command of her, and spent 1761 cruising in the Bay of Biscay.

2500|$|Wearers of the zoot suits had {{different}} reasons for wearing them. Filipino men dressed in zoot suits sought to challenge their socioeconomic {{status in the}} United States. Instead of proving stereotypes true, Filipino men wanted {{to appeal to the}} masculinity portrayed by Hollywood stars in the 1920’s and 1930’s. Having multiple girlfriends and mistresses was common and even encouraged among these men. As mentioned earlier, Filipinos sent photographs of themselves donning suits to give the impression to their families back home that they were successful. These photographs encouraged other Filipino men to come to the United States in order to fulfill the “American Dream”. Filipinos wore suits for numerous occasions, such as <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pool rooms, gambling houses, dance clubs, and night clubs with the intention of attracting women of other races and ethnicities such as Mexican-American women and Caucasian women. This often caused physical confrontations among Caucasian men. [...] Those who donned the zoot suit were seen as devious. Los Angeles public officials and social agencies look to combat the growing number of Mexican, Filipino, and African-American youths by instituting restrictive policies such as curfews and civic group activities.|$|E
