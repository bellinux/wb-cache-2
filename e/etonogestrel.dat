50|$|<b>Etonogestrel,</b> {{also known}} as 11-methylene-17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone or as 11-methylene-17α-ethynyl-18-methylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is more specifically a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) {{and is a member}} of the gonane (18-methylestrane) subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins. <b>Etonogestrel</b> is the C3 ketone derivative of desogestrel and the C11 methylene derivative of levonorgestrel and is {{also known as}} 3-ketodesogestrel and as 11-methylenelevonorgestrel.|$|E
50|$|Desogestrel is a progestogen. It behaves as a prodrug to <b>etonogestrel</b> (3-ketodesogestrel). It has low {{androgenic}} activity.|$|E

50|$|Ethinylestradiol/etonogestrel (brand names NuvaRing) is a {{contraceptive}} {{vaginal ring}} containing the estrogen ethinylestradiol and the progestin <b>etonogestrel</b> which is marketed in the United States and Europe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etonogestrel</b> {{implants}} {{were approved}} {{for medical use}} in Indonesia in 1998 and in the United States in 2006. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 8.93 to 13.29 USD. In the United Kingdom the device costs the NHS about 83.43 pounds. The cost in the United States is about 625.00 USD. <b>Etonogestrel</b> implants are approved in more than 90 countries and used by about three million women globally as of 2010.|$|E
50|$|The {{contraceptive}} {{vaginal ring}} is contraindicated for {{a risk of}} blood clots. This is because it contains the hormone <b>etonogestrel,</b> the active metabolite of the prodrug desogestrel. It is a third-generation contraceptive.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the combinded oral {{contraceptive}} pill <b>etonogestrel</b> contraceptive implant is not contraindicated {{in women with}} past history of breast cancer as the pill does not contain estrogen (the driver of metaplastic change in some breast cancers).|$|E
50|$|Nexplanon/Implanon {{consists}} of a single rod made of ethylene vinylacetate copolymer that is 4 cm long and 2mm in diameter. It {{is similar to a}} matchstick in size. The rod contains 68 mg of <b>etonogestrel</b> (sometimes called 3-keto-destrogestrel), a type of progestin. Peak serum <b>etonogestrel</b> concentrations have been found to reach 781-894 pg/mL in the first few weeks, gradually decreasing to 192-261 pg/mL after 1 year, 154-194 pg/mL after 2 years, and 156-177 pg/mL after 3 years, maintaining ovulation suppression and contraceptive efficacy. Serum levels maintain relatively stable through 36 months, which implies that the method may be effective for longer than 3 years.|$|E
50|$|Within {{a week of}} removal, {{the hormones}} from the device leave the body and <b>etonogestrel</b> is {{undetectable}} in most users. Most women will begin to ovulate within six weeks of removal.Fertility levels will return {{to what they were}} before Nexplanon or Implanon insertion.|$|E
50|$|Some {{examples}} of progestins {{that are used}} in hormonal contraceptives are norethisterone (many brand names, most notably Ortho-Novum and Ovcon), norgestimate (Ortho Tricyclen, Ortho-Cyclen), levonorgestrel (Alesse, Trivora-28, Plan B, Mirena), medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera, Depo-Provera), cyproterone acetate (Diane-35), desogestrel, <b>etonogestrel</b> (Nexplanon), and drospirenone (Yasmin, Yasminelle, YAZ).|$|E
50|$|Nandrolone, {{together}} with ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone), {{is also the}} parent compound of {{a large group of}} progestins, the norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) derivatives. This family is subdivided into two groups: the estranes and the gonanes. The estranes include norethisterone (norethindrone), norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and noretynodrel, while the gonanes include norgestrel, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, <b>etonogestrel,</b> gestodene, norgestimate, dienogest (actually a 17α-cyanomethyl-19-nortestosterone derivative), and norelgestromin.|$|E
50|$|The {{possibility}} of the subdermal contraceptive implant began when silicone was discovered in the 1940s and found to be bio-compatible with the human body.In 1964, Folkman and Long published the first study demonstrating that such a rod {{could be used to}} deliver drugs.In 1966 Dziuk and Cook published a study that looked at release rates and suggested that the rods could be well suited for contraception. After a study that used implants with progestogens for contraception, the Population Council developed and patented Norplant and Jadelle. Norplant has six rods and is considered a first generation implant. Jadelle (Norplant II) and other single rod implants that followed were developed because of complications resulting from Norplants 6 rod system. The Jadelle system contains two silicone rods mixed with levonorgestrel. In 1990 De Nijs patented a co-axial extrusion technique of ethylene vinylacetate copolymers and 3-keto-desogestrel (<b>etonogestrel)</b> for the preparation of long-acting contraceptive devices, such as Implanon, Nexplanon and Nuvaring. The single rods were less visible under the skin and used <b>etonogestrel</b> as opposed to levonorgestrel in the hopes that it would reduce side effects.|$|E
50|$|A {{study found}} that users of vaginal rings with {{ethinylestradiol}} and <b>etonogestrel</b> have a 6.5 times increased risk of venous thrombosis compared to non-users. This is commensurate with the risk of thrombosis due {{to the use of}} combination birth control pills, which in studies ranged between 2.9 times to 13.7 times the risk. As such, contraceptive vaginal rings do not necessarily appear to pose a lower risk of thrombosis than do birth control pills.|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} introduced, as Implanon in Indonesia, in 1998, and was {{subsequently}} marketed in the United Kingdom shortly thereafter {{and in the}} United States in 2006. <b>Etonogestrel</b> is less androgenic than levonorgestrel and norethisterone, {{and it does not}} cause a decrease in sex hormone-binding globulin levels. However, it is still associated with acne in up to 13% of patients when used as an implant, though this only accounts for 1% of premature removals.|$|E
50|$|Side effects include no menstrual periods, {{which occurs}} {{in about a}} third of women. Otherwise side effects may include {{irregular}} bleeding but are generally few. In those who are overweight earlier replacement may be required. It is not recommended in people with liver disease. The <b>etonogestrel</b> implant is a type of long-acting reversible birth control. It works by stopping ovulation, thickening the mucus around the opening of the cervix, and altering the lining of the uterus.|$|E
50|$|Studies with steroids {{similar to}} {{dienogest}} (e.g., dienolone) {{have found that}} the introduction of a double bond between the C9 and C10 positions is associated with similar/almost unchanged affinity for the PR and AR. On the other hand, the C9(10) double bond of dienogest appears to inhibit metabolism via 5α-reductase and/or 5β-reductase, which is the major metabolic route for other 19-nortestosterone progestins like norethisterone, norgestrel, and <b>etonogestrel,</b> and this may serve to improve the metabolic stability and potency of dienogest.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, ethisterone, gestrinone, danazol, tibolone, normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and quingestanol acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include desogestrel, <b>etonogestrel,</b> gestodene, and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone, allylestrenol, and dimethisterone appear to have negligible activity. Dienogest and oxendolone are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E
50|$|The {{contraceptive}} implant is hormone-based and highly effective, approved {{in more than}} 60 countries and used by millions of women around the world. The typical implant is a small flexible tube measuring about 40mm in length and is inserted under the skin (typically in the upper arm) by a health care professional. After it is inserted it prevents pregnancy by releasing hormones that prevent ovaries from releasing eggs and thicken cervical mucous. The two most common versions are the single-rod <b>etonogestrel</b> implant and the two-rod levonorgestrel implant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etonogestrel</b> is {{the active}} {{metabolite}} of the inactive prodrug desogestrel, {{one of two}} third-generation progestins found in some epidemiological studies of combined oral contraceptive pills {{to be associated with}} a higher risk of venous thrombosis than combined oral contraceptive pills containing certain second-generation progestins. Because hormones are released continuously from NuvaRing, peak and total estrogen and progestin doses are significantly lower than with combined oral contraceptives, although it is not known whether this lowers the risk of blood clots. It is effective within the first 8 hours of insertion.|$|E
5000|$|A {{study in}} the BMJ, with over 1.6 million women, found that users of vaginal rings with {{ethinylestradiol}} and <b>etonogestrel</b> have a 6.5 times increased risk of venous thrombosis compared to non-users. [...] Epidemiological {{studies have shown that}} oral contraceptives that contain desogestrel can increase the risk of blood clots (venous thrombosis) by 1.5 to 2.4 times the risk of second-generation oral contraceptives. [...] Second-generation oral contraceptives do not contain desogestrel. Hormones are released continuously from NuvaRing, thus peak and total estrogen and progestin doses are significantly lower than with combined oral contraceptives, but what effect this has on the risk of blood clots has not been established.|$|E
5000|$|EE {{has been}} marketed as a {{standalone}} oral drug under the brand names Esteed, Estinyl, Feminone, Lynoral, Menolyn, Novestrol, Palonyl, Spanestrin, and Ylestrol among others, although {{most or all}} of these formulations are now discontinued. It is marketed under {{a very large number of}} brand names throughout the world in combination with progestins for use as an oral contraceptive. In addition, EE is marketed in the [...] in combination with norelgestromin under the brand names Ortho Evra and Xulane as a contraceptive patch, in combination with <b>etonogestrel</b> under the brand name NuvaRing as a contraceptive vaginal ring, and in combination with norethisterone acetate under the brand name FemHRT in oral hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms.|$|E

40|$|Deep <b>etonogestrel</b> {{contraceptive}} implant placements still occur despite design {{modifications to the}} implant inserter. We present a method for outpatient removal of a nonpalpable <b>etonogestrel</b> implant using preprocedure ultrasonography for implant localization followed by removal with a modified vasectomy clamp, a modification of the "U" technique for six-capsule levonorgestrel implant removal. In women with a nonpalpable <b>etonogestrel</b> implant containing barium sulfate, we obtain a radiographic examination to confirm the implant's presence in the upper extremity. Using an 18 -MHz linear ultrasound transducer, we identify and mark the implant location on the patient's arm, noting the depth. We remove the implant with local anesthesia in the office using a modified vasectomy clamp through a 5 -mm or less skin incision directly over the implant. All three patients referred to our office with nonpalpable <b>etonogestrel</b> implants had successful removal using this technique.

40|$|Background Single rod implant (<b>etonogestrel</b> 68 mg) usage {{is one of}} {{long-term}} contraceptive methods suggested by government {{in an effort to}} reduce population growth rate in Indonesia. On the other side, using a single rod implant have been developing many myths such as the declining quality of sexual intercourse or disruption on sexual function itself. Objective To describe about female sexual function index on single rod implant (<b>Etonogestrel</b> 68 mg) users. Method `This research was an observational descriptive research with cross sectional study. Research subject is 26 woman using single rod implant of <b>etonogestrel</b> 68 mg. Data were collected by questionnaire assessment by the respondents and the result presented to provide an overview about variable that need to be described.

40|$|OBJECTIVES:To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} two medical treatments for endometriosis on insulin sensitivity. STUDY DESIGN:After surgery, 26 women with endometriosis were randomly allocated to a 6 -month treatment with a GnRH agonist (Leuprorelin 3. 75 mg/ 28 days) or a subdermal progestin implant (<b>etonogestrel</b> 68 mg). Insulin sensitivity (SI) and glucose utilization independent of insulin (Sg) were investigated at baseline and after 6 months by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) associated with the minimal model method. RESULTS:Both therapies tended to decrease SI, but the effect did not reach statistical significance in the GnRH agonist group (5. 43 +/- 1. 29 vs. 3. 99 +/- 0. 8) and was significant in the <b>etonogestrel</b> group (5. 74 +/- 1. 12 vs. 3. 95 +/- 0, 78; p=. 046). Sg, fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide and C-peptide/insulin were not modified by either treatment. CONCLUSIONS:The modifications of glucose-insulin metabolism induced by the GnRH agonist are of no relevance for the short-term use of this molecule. Even if the modification induced by the <b>etonogestrel</b> implant is subtle and of no major impact, it {{should be taken into}} consideration for the long-term treatment of individuals with abnormalities of glucose-insulin metabolism...|$|E
