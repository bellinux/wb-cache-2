500|$|Despite the success, Hutchinson {{was voted}} {{out of the}} {{assembly}} in 1749. [...] He was, however, immediately appointed to the Governor's Council. In 1749 he headed a commission to arrange a treaty with the Indians in the District of Maine, which was then part of Massachusetts, and he served on boundary commissions to settle disputes with Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1752 he was appointed <b>judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> and a justice of the Common Pleas. Following {{the outbreak of the}} French and Indian War in 1754, he was a delegate to the Albany Convention. [...] In that meeting he took a leading part in the discussions, working with Benjamin Franklin to draft a plan for colonial union. [...] Hutchinson agreed with Franklin that the present disunity endangered the British colonies, and that decisive action must be taken to knit the too-often-competing colonies into a coherent whole. Most important, the report drafted by Hutchinson concluded that the colonies must be encouraged to establish [...] "a Union of His Majesty's several governments on the continent, that so their councils, treasure, and strength may be employed in due proportion against their common enemy".|$|E
500|$|The {{farmhouse}} {{was built}} by Russel Gallup in 1826 before the incorporation {{of the town of}} Ledyard in 1836. Gallup served {{as a member of the}} Connecticut Militia in the War of 1812. He would hold the office of deacon for the Ledyard Congregation Church for over fifty years. The property was split as a deed to his second son, Rufus Gallup in 1855 and ownership passed upon Russel Gallup's death in 1869. Rufus Gallup took the same approach with his son, Russell Gallup II, and split the property in 1877. Russell Gallup II was a teacher and became a <b>Judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate</b> from 1896 until his death in 1911. Everett Gallup took over the farm in the 1920s and was the last member of the Gallup family to own the farm. The property was later owned by Arlene Meyer Cohen. A 40-acre parcel of the original property was sold to Sarter in November 1984. The house was acquired by the Betz family, who sought to operate the farmhouse as a bed and breakfast. Betz owned the farmhouse at the time of its nomination to the National Historic Register in 1987. Applewood Farm operated as [...] "Applewood Farms Inn", serving as a six-guest room bed and breakfast through the 1990s. In 2005, the property was sold from Applewoods Estates LLC ...|$|E

60|$|If {{among the}} {{property}} {{left by a}} person deceased, which is to go in part to children, there are any houses and lands,--a kind of property which is called in law real estate, to distinguish it from moveable property, which is called personal estate,--such real estate cannot be sold, in ordinary cases, by the administrator, without leave from the <b>Judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate.</b> This leave the <b>Judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate</b> will give in cases where it is clearly best for the children that the property should be so sold and the avails of it kept for them, rather than the property itself. All these things Mrs. Bell explained to Mary Erskine, having learned about them herself some years before when her own husband died.|$|E
60|$|At the Probate court, Mary Erskine {{made all}} the {{arrangements}} necessary in respect to the estate. She had to go twice, in fact, before all these arrangements were completed. She {{expected to have a}} great deal of trouble and embarrassment in doing this business, but she did not find that there was any trouble at all. The <b>Judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate</b> told her exactly what to do. She was required to sign her name once or twice to papers. This she did with great trepidation, and after writing her name, on the first occasion which occurred requiring her signature, she apologized for not being able to write any better. The <b>Judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate</b> said that very few of the papers that he received were signed so well.|$|E

6000|$|Whenever {{any person}} dies, leaving {{property}} {{to be divided}} among his heirs, and not leaving any valid will to determine the mode of division, the property as has already been said, must be divided on certain principles, established by {{the law of the}} land, and {{under the direction of the}} <b>Judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate,</b> who has jurisdiction over the county in which the property is situated. The <b>Judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate</b> appoints a person to take charge of the property and divide it among the heirs. This person is called the administrator, or, if a woman, the administratrix. The Judge gives the administrator or the administratrix a paper, which authorises him or her to take charge of the property, which paper is called, [...] "Letters of Administration." [...] The letters of administration are usually granted to the wife of the deceased, or to his oldest son, or, if there is no wife or son, to the nearest heir who is of proper age and discretion to manage the trust. The person who receives administration is obliged to take a solemn oath before the <b>Judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate,</b> that he will report to the Judge a full account of all the property that belonged to the deceased which shall come to his knowledge. The Judge also appoints three persons to go and examine the property, and make an inventory of it, and appraise every article, so as to know as nearly as possible, how much and what property there is. These persons are called appraisers. The inventory which they make out is lodged in the office of the <b>Judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate,</b> where any person who has an interest in the estate can see it at any time. The administrator usually keeps a copy of the inventory besides.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps {{there is}} no need to go into the details of Mr. Price's discomfiture on the {{occasion}} of this interview. The judge was by nature of a sour disposition, but he haw-hawed so loudly as he explained to Mr. Price the identity of the road agent that the <b>judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> in the next office thought his colleague had gone mad. Afterward Mr. Price stood for some time in the entry, where no one could see him, scratching his head and repeating his favorite exclamation, [...] "I want to know!" [...] It has been ascertained that he omitted to pay his respects to the spinster on that day.|$|E

On the walls hung {{the pictures of}} Hutchinson's ancestors, who had been eminent men in their day, and were honorably remembered {{in the history of}} the country. Every object served to mark the residence of a rich, aristocratic gentleman, who held himself high above the common people, and could have nothing to fear from them. In a corner of the room, thrown carelessly upon a chair, were the scarlet robes of the chief justice. This high office, as well as those of lieutenant-governor, councillor, and <b>judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate,</b> was filled by Hutchinson.|$|E

60|$|In {{order that}} the {{property}} of men who die, should be disposed of properly, according to law, or according to the will, if any will be made, it is required that soon {{after the death of}} any person takes place, the state of the case should be reported at a certain public office, instituted to attend to this business. There is such an office in every county in the New England states. It is called the Probate office. The officer, who has this business in charge, is called the <b>Judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate.</b> There is a similar system in force, in all the other states of the Union, though the officers are sometimes called by different names from those which they receive in New England.|$|E
60|$|Now, while Albert {{was lying}} sick upon his bed, he was {{occupied}} {{a great deal}} of the time, while they thought that he was asleep, in thinking what was to become of his wife and children in case he should die. He knew very well that in case he died without making any will, his property must be divided, under the direction of the <b>Judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate,</b> and one part of it be kept for the children, while Mary Erskine would have the control only of the other part. This is a very excellent arrangement in all ordinary cases, so that the law, in itself, is a very good law. There are, however, some cases, which are exceptions, and Albert thought that Mary Erskine's case was one. It was owing, in a great measure, to her prudence and economy, to her efficient industry, and to her contented and happy disposition, that he had been able to acquire any property, instead of spending all that he earned, like Mr. Gordon, as fast as he earned it. Then, besides, he knew that Mary Erskine would act as conscientiously and faithfully for the benefit of the children, if the property was all her own, as she would if a part of it was theirs, and only held by herself, for safe keeping, as their guardian. Whereas, if this last arrangement went into effect, he feared that it would make her great trouble to keep the accounts, as she could not write, not even to sign her name. He determined, therefore, to make a will, and give all his property, of every kind, absolutely to her. This he did, in the manner described in the last chapter.|$|E
6000|$|A table, {{stationary}} {{ever since}} the house was built, extending the whole length of a room. One end was raised two steps higher than the rest. The Lady Ursula, an early Colonial heroine, was wont to dine at the upper end, while her servants sat below. This was in the kitchen. An old garden and summer-house, and roses, currant-bushes, and tulips, which Lady Ursula had brought from Grondale Abbey in Old England. Although {{a hundred and fifty}} years before, and though their roots were propagated all over the country, they were still flourishing in the original garden. This Lady Ursula was the daughter of Lord Thomas Cutts of Grondale Abbey in England. She had been in love with an officer named Fowler, who {{was supposed to have been}} slain in battle. After the death of her father and mother, Lady Ursula came to Kittery, bringing twenty men-servants and several women. After a time, a letter arrived from her lover, who was not killed, but merely a prisoner to the French. He announced his purpose to come to America, where he would arrive in October. A few days after the letter came, she went out in a low carriage to visit her work-people, and was blessing the food for their luncheon, when she fell dead, struck by an Indian tomahawk, as did all the rest save one. They were buried where the massacre took place, and a stone was erected, which (possibly) still remains. The lady's family had a grant from Sir Ferdinando Gorges of the territory thereabout, and her brother had likewise come over and settled in the vicinity. I believe very little of this story. Long afterwards, at about the commencement of the Revolution, a descendant of Fowler came from England, and applied to the <b>Judge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate</b> to search the records for a will, supposed to have been made by Lady Ursula in favor of her lover as soon as she heard of his existence. In the mean time the estate had been sold to Colonel Whipple. No will could be found. (Lady Ursula was old Mrs. Cutts, widow of President Cutts.) ...|$|E
