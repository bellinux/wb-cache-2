Ramachandran (MGR) [...] MGR had nominated a Tamil film actress, Vennira Aadai Nirmala (aka A. B. Shanthi) to the Council. Her swearing in ceremony {{was scheduled for}} 23 April 1986. Nirmala had earlier declared insolvency and according to Article 102-(1)(c) of the Indian Constitution, an <b>insolvent</b> <b>person</b> can not serve {{as a member of}} parliament or state legislature. On 21 April, a lawyer named S. K. Sundaram, filed a public interest writ petition in the Madras High Court challenging Nirmala's nomination to the Council. MGR loaned Nirmala a sum of Rupees 4,65,000 from ADMK's party funds to pay off her creditors, so that her insolvency declaration could be annulled. The same day, Nirmala's lawyer Subramaniam Pichai, was able to persuade judge Ramalingam to set aside her insolvency. He used a provision in the Section 31 of The Presidency Towns Insolvency Act of 1909, which allowed a judge to annul an insolvency retrospectively if all debts had been paid in full. This annulment made Nirmala's nomination valid and the writ petition against it was dismissed. However, Nirmala withdrew her nomination to the council. The Governor of Tamil Nadu, Sundar Lal Khurana asked MGR to explain how Nirmala's nomination was proposed without proper vetting. Miffed with this incident, MGR decided to abolish the council.|$|E

Neretai bankroto sąvoka mokslininkų yra aiškinama kaip per daug didelių įsipareigojimų turėjimas, kada asmuo neturi galimybės patenkinti visų finansinių įsipareigojimų. Vienas iš pagrindinių bankroto bylos proceso dalyvių yra fizinių ar juridinių asmenų bankroto administratorius. Jo kompetencijai priklauso kuo didesne apimtimi patenkinti kreditorinius reikalavimus bei tinkamai pasirūpinti bankrutuojančio fizinio ar juridinio asmens teisėtų interesų apsauga. Po bankroto bylos iškėlimo, bankroto administratorius perima visą skolininko turtą bei asmeninius duomenis, jo prerogatyvoje yra bankroto plano įgyvendinimas, jis tampa svarbiausia grandimi, jungiančia skolininko bei kreditorių teisėtų interesų įgyvendinimo politiką. Bankroto administratorius, vykdydamas jam teisiškai priklausančias užduotis, dalyvauja privačiame asmens gyvenime bei jį suvaržo, siekdamas patenkinti kreditorių interesus. Todėl iškyla klausimas ar bankroto proceso metu nėra pažeidžiama teisė į skolininkų privatumą? Pagrindinis šiame darbe iškeltas tikslas yra išanalizuoti bankroto administratoriaus įgaliojimus tiek fizinių asmenų, tiek juridinių asmenų bankroto procese bei jų santykį su asmens teise į privatumą, privataus gyvenimo neliečiamumą bei konfidencialios informacijos (komercinių ar gamybinių paslapčių) apsaugą. Šis darbas yra sudarytas iš dviejų pagrindinių dalių bei įvado, išvadų ir rekomendacijų. Pirmojoje darbo dalyje yra analizuojama fizinių asmenų teisę į privataus gyvenimo neliečiamumą, įstatymo nustatytas bankroto administratoriaus teises ir pareigas bei jų kolizija. Antrojoje darbo dalyje yra kalbama apie juridinių asmenų bankroto procese bankroto administratoriui suteiktus įgaliojimus, juridinių asmenų konfidencialios informacijos apsaugą bei kreditorių vaidmenį. In {{this paper}} it is {{discussed}} about corporate and personal bankruptcy ant its’ features regarding the executive functions of bankruptcy administrator and his ratio towards creditors and <b>insolvent</b> <b>person</b> himself. Most often the term “Bankruptcy” is interpreted by various authors as the person’s possession of many large-scale commitments, {{when the person}} {{is not able to}} meet all financial obligations. The Republic of Lithuania has in force two fully functional bankruptcy codes: one is regulating bankruptcies of legal entities, and the other – governing personal bankruptcies. In both codes it is declared mandatory condition for the opening of bankruptcy case – the state of insolvency, i. e. person’s or entity’s inability to comply with all their financial obligations. The codes provide various rights and duties regarding the bankruptcy administrator, as well as, regulate the role of the creditors and insolvent person’s or entity’s responsibilities. One of the main roles in bankruptcy process is granted to the natural or legal persons’ bankruptcy administrator. In his competence, bankruptcy administrator has the duty to satisfy creditors’ claims in the widest possible extent, as well as, the obligation {{to take care of the}} insolvent natural or legal person's legitimate interests. After the opening of the bankruptcy case, bankruptcy administrator takes over all the debtor's assets and personal information, the prerogative of the bankruptcy plan implementation falls into his hands, bankruptcy administrator becomes the most important link, connecting the debtor’s and the creditors' legitimate interests implementation. Bankruptcy administrator, by performing the tasks, which the law empowers him to do, involves in a person's life and it restricts, in order to meet the interests of creditors. Therefore, automatically rises question whether the bankruptcy process does not violate the right to privacy? The main objective of this paper is to analyse the powers of bankruptcy administrator in both natural persons’ and legal entities’ bankruptcy proceedings, as well as, their relationship with the civil right to privacy, the right to private life inviolability and sensitive, confidential information’s (commercial or industrial secrets) protection. The uprising problem is urgent and relevant to both natural persons’ and legal entities’ bankruptcy proceedings. During bankruptcy proceedings bankruptcy administrator is an intermediary between the debtor’s and creditors’ interests, he is entrusted with the delicate duty not only to properly manage debtor's assets, but also handle private information regarding <b>insolvent</b> <b>person</b> or entity. After opening bankruptcy case, debtors are required to provide all necessary information including information which is related to his private life. Therefore, it seems that the right to privacy is only applicable until the opening of bankruptcy case – from that moment forward, the right to privacy is conditional. But the problem is mutual, involving both the debtor and the bankruptcy administrator. First of all, in personal bankruptcy process: Whether every time the debtor gets a gift, he must report it to authorities or maybe bankruptcy administrator has to work as private investigator to ensure such process? Secondly, whether bankruptcy administrator's obligation to take over and implement the debtor's assets, or assets to which the debtor has the right, for example, distribution databases that contain private customer information, in order that it would be satisfied creditors’ claims to the greatest possible extent, does not interfere with right to privacy, i. e. whether there are not violated interests of people who are not involved in the bankruptcy process, but their private, sensitive, personal information is passed to third parties in order to meet creditors’ claims? Hence the relevance of the problem is fundamentally important not only for <b>insolvent</b> <b>person,</b> but also for bankruptcy administrators. The relevance of this paper is determined by the fact that there two fully functional bankruptcy codes in which bankruptcy administrators are empowered with specific powers, allowing them to manage the insolvent person’s or entity’s private life. Nevertheless, this topic, regarding scientific perspective, is not widely researched. In the world, especially in the United Stated, it is opposite – it is widely discussed. United States has long history with bankruptcy proceedings, which holds the example of how persons or legal entities have to be treated regarding bankruptcy proceedings, how courts have to take in consideration various aspects of person’s life, how information, which bankruptcy administrator takes over after bankruptcy case is opened, should be handled. The problem arises from both natural and legal persons’ bankruptcy proceedings. In the Republic of Lithuania this subject is discussed much more narrowly, however, the trend is getting more relevant every day. This paper consists of two main parts along with summary, introduction, conclusions and recommendations. The first part of this paper describes individual’s right to privacy, bankruptcy administrator’s rights and duties granted by law, and the conflict between those different rights and duties. The second part is talking about legal entities, their bankruptcy administrator’s powers during bankruptcy process, about legal entities’ right to privacy as in protecting companies’ confidential information and, of course, about the role of creditors during legal entities’ bankruptcy proceeding...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LL. M.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. This {{dissertation}} is {{the analysis}} of sections 64, 65, 66 and 152 of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936. Sections 414 to 418 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 are also touched upon {{in so far as}} they relate to these sections of the Insolvency Act. These sections entail the compulsory attendance of the creditors 'meetings by the insolvent. At these meetings the interrogation of the insolvent regarding his insolvent estate is conducted. Its purpose is to ensure that the insolvent accounts for the assets of his estate and supply reasons for his bankruptcy. The information gathered thereat will assist in the due and fair distribution of his assets amongst his creditors. The purpose of this research is to examine whether the application of these sections to the <b>insolvent</b> <b>person</b> (juristic or natural) is in compliance with the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. The provisions provided for by this sections appears to be good, however there is another viewpoint. The fact that the insolvent and any other person interrogated may be compelled to divulge certain privilege information, even to the extent of incriminating himself (themselves) in the process seems to be violating certain rights of the person interrogated, for example, one's right not to incriminate himself This right especially comes to mind when one considers the fact that information divulged at the interrogations may be used against the person giving it in subsequent proceedings relating to perjury, administration of the insolvent estate, taking of oath and so forth. These sections also provides for the detention of the person who fails to comply with the provisions of this Act. The detention {{is said to be a}} mechanism that the legislature needs to ensure compliance and is not regarded as detention without trial. However, the detention has to be ordered by a judicial officer presiding over the meeting of creditors and not a person from the executive organ of the state. Case law has however indicated that there is nothing unconstitutional about these sections as long as they are applied with precautionary measures, taking into consideration the rights of the interrogatee or person examined as entrenched in the Bill of Rights. The principles of justice also require that every one shall be entitled to fair proceedings. Master...|$|E
