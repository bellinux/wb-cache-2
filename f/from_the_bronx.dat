5|$|Manhattan Island is loosely {{divided into}} Downtown (Lower Manhattan), Midtown (Midtown Manhattan), and Uptown (Upper Manhattan), with Fifth Avenue {{dividing}} Manhattan's {{east and west}} sides.

To the north, the Harlem River divides Manhattan Island <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> and the mainland United States.|$|E
5|$|One {{neighborhood}} of New York County is contiguous with the U.S. mainland. Marble Hill {{at one time}} was part of Manhattan Island, but the Harlem River Ship Canal, dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the Harlem River, separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an island between the Bronx and the remainder of Manhattan. Before World War I, {{the section of the}} original Harlem River channel separating Marble Hill <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bronx</b> was filled in, and Marble Hill became part of the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Stories for {{the show}} were often co-written by Burns, who also became a {{producer}} in the show's fourth season. Other writers include three acclaimed crime fiction writers from outside of Baltimore: George Pelecanos from Washington, Richard Price <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> and Dennis Lehane from Boston. Reviewers drew comparisons between Price's works (particularly Clockers) and The Wire even before he joined. In addition to writing, Pelecanos served as a producer for the third season. Pelecanos has commented that he was attracted to the project because {{of the opportunity to}} work with Simon. Staff writer Rafael Alvarez penned several episodes' scripts, as well as the series guidebook The Wire: Truth Be Told. Alvarez is a colleague of Simon's from The Baltimore Sun and a Baltimore native with working experience in the port area. Another city native and independent filmmaker, Joy Lusco, also wrote {{for the show}} in each of its first three seasons. Baltimore Sun writer and political journalist William F. Zorzi joined the writing staff in the third season and brought a wealth of experience to the show's examination of Baltimore politics.|$|E

5|$|The Sprain Brook Parkway, {{designated}} by the New York State Department of Transportation as NY987F, a state reference route, begins at a fork <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> River Parkway along the latter's right-of-way along the Bronx River {{in the city of}} Yonkers. Crossing through the Northeast Yonkers neighborhood as a six-lane freeway design, the Sprain Brook crosses an interchange with NY100 (Central Park Avenue) south of Andrus Park. Bending to the north through Yonkers, the Sprain Brook reaches an interchange with Tuckahoe Road, with the northbound and southbound lanes splitting around the Grassy Sprain Reservoir. The two directions bend northeast along the reservoir. The southbound lanes cross Sprain Ridge Park, while the northbound lanes cross through a golf course. Leaving Yonkers for the town of Greenburgh, the lanes of the Sprain Brook come back together, reaching an interchange with Jackson Avenue. The six lane parkway continues northward and to the northeast through Greenburgh, crossing under Ardsley Road. After turning northward once again, the Sprain Brook crosses under a former alignment of NY131 (Underhill Road) and passes by the Sunningdale Country Club.|$|E

25|$|Randalls Island (also called Randall's Island) and Wards Island are {{conjoined}} islands, collectively called Randalls and Wards Islands, in the New York City {{borough of}} Manhattan, separated from Manhattan by the Harlem River, from Queens by the East River and Hell Gate, and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> by the Bronx Kill.

25|$|The Hudson River {{flows through}} the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York, the river is an estuary. The Hudson River {{separates}} the city from the U.S. state of New Jersey. The East River—a tidal strait—flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates most of Manhattan <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx.</b> The Bronx River, which {{flows through the}} Bronx and Westchester County, is the only entirely fresh water river in the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} a {{crossing}} between the Bronx and Whitestone, Queens had come as early as 1905. At the time, residents around the proposed area of the bridge protested construction in fear of losing the then-rural character of the community. In 1929, however, the Regional Plan Association had proposed another bridge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> to northern Queens to allow motorists from upstate New York and New England to reach Queens and Long Island without traveling through the traffic-ridden communities of western Queens. On February 25, 1930, influential planner Robert Moses proposed a Ferry Point Park-Whitestone Bridge {{as a part of}} his Belt Parkway system around Brooklyn and Queens.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of the interchange was originally {{the point where the}} Whitestone Parkway connected to Bruckner Boulevard (then-New York State Route1A). In the early 1940s, the Hutchinson River Parkway was extended southward from Pelham Bay Park to Bruckner Boulevard, where it fed into the Whitestone Parkway. Bruckner Boulevard also served as the initial eastern endpoint of the Cross Bronx Expressway, the first section of which was built in the early 1950s and ran <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> River Parkway to a point just west of the Hutchinson River Parkway. The section of Bruckner Boulevard between the Cross Bronx Expressway and the Hutchinson River Parkway was upgraded into a freeway shortly afterward.|$|E

25|$|The {{second phase}} of the Second Avenue Line will extend the Q to a new {{northern}} terminal at 125th Street, with planned stops at 116th Street and 106th Street, a transfer to the existing 125th Street station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and a connection to Harlem-125th Street station on Metro-North Railroad. This will provide residents of East Harlem with direct subway service via Second Avenue and Broadway to the Upper East Side, western Midtown, Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, and offer connections to passengers <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bronx,</b> the northern suburbs and Connecticut. Under the approved plan, the MTA estimates to complete Phase 2 between 2027 and 2029.|$|E
25|$|Automobiles had {{displaced}} {{the railroad}} {{as the most}} common means of transport. Parkways and other dedicated roads had been built from the city in all directions. One proposal, made in the late 1920s, called for a Hudson River Expressway to run along the river's eastern shore, paralleling the railroad, <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bronx</b> to Beacon, including through downtown Ossining. Governor Nelson Rockefeller, whose ancestral estate Kykuit would have been along the route, introduced a shortened version in 1958, a Tarrytown-Beacon Interstate 487. After intense local opposition, he canceled the plan in 1971. Part of it had been making urban renewal funds available to affected communities, and that was retained.|$|E
