30|$|This paper, {{through the}} survey and {{analysis}} on <b>deep</b> <b>mines</b> in Eastern China, summarizes features of three typical heat-harm mines. On the basis of summarizing and analyzing previous heat-harm control technologies, and aiming at the usage of deep geo-thermal energy, HEMS-technology has been successfully developed. With the utilization of <b>deep</b> <b>mine</b> heat-harm as resources, ground coal-fired boiler has been replaced to achieve the mining area’s purpose of saving energy, protecting environment and sustainable developing, while solving <b>deep</b> <b>mine</b> heat-harm problems.|$|R

50|$|When the UK coal {{industry}} was privatised in 1994, Budge bought {{most of the}} pits for £815m, forming RJB Mining, which he had started in 1992 after buying his brother's opencast business division for £102.5m. This led to Budge being christened King Coal. He bought three out of five packages of the UK {{coal industry}} (17 <b>deep</b> <b>mine</b> pits) on 30 December 1994 for around £700m. At the time there were 19 <b>deep</b> <b>mines</b> left in the UK. The last of these remaining <b>deep</b> <b>mine</b> pits, Kellingley Colliery, would close on 18 December 2015.|$|R

50|$|The Ministry of Environment {{gave the}} green light to <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> in mid-November, albeit with 22 {{conditions}} that would make mining method environmentally acceptable in the Czechoslovak Army Mine. According to Ministry spokesman, Matyáš Vitík, the Ministry addressed 16 different professional organisations with the competency to say whether <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> would have any effect on the environment. “The overwhelming majority of them responded that it wouldn’t be necessary to do an EIA Impact Assessment”, said Vitík. Vitík added, however, that the Ministry was not able to permit or prohibit <b>deep</b> <b>mining,</b> but only set conditions regarding the environment. “Protection of the environment, including the health and lives of the population, is guaranteed.”Residents in Horní Jiřetín, however, are afraid that <b>deep</b> <b>mines</b> in the adjacent slopes of the opencast mine may cause further landslides. The municipal authority is therefore considering whether it should take the matter up with the state mining administration.|$|R

The last of the <b>deep</b> coal <b>mines</b> closed in the early 1950s. As the demand continued to slack, RI&C shut down in 1956 along with the EBT and both were sold to the Kovalchick Salvage Company of Indiana, Pennsylvania. Limited <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> resumed under contractors and contract surface mining continued into the 1990s. Limited surface mining resumed in the late 2000s.|$|R

40|$|Mineral {{consumption}} is increasing rapidly as more consumers enter {{the market for}} minerals and as the global standard of living increases. As a result, underground mining continues to progress to deeper levels in order to tackle the mineral supply crisis in the 21 st century. However, <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> occurs in a very technical and challenging environment, in which significant innovative solutions and best practice are required and additional safety standards must be implemented in order to overcome the challenges and reap huge economic gains. These challenges include the catastrophic events that are often met in <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> engineering: rockbursts, gas outbursts, high in situ and redistributed stresses, large deformation, squeezing and creeping rocks, and high temperature. This review paper presents the current global status of <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> and highlights some of the newest technological achievements and opportunities associated with rock mechanics and geotechnical engineering in <b>deep</b> <b>mining.</b> Of the various technical achievements, unmanned working-faces and unmanned mines based on fully automated mining and mineral extraction processes have become important fields in the 21 st century...|$|R
