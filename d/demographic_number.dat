40|$|IntroductionEvidence-based {{technical}} assistance {{may be needed}} to implement recent federal policy to prevent childhood obesity through the schools. The Healthy Schools Program is the largest school-based obesity prevention program in the United States. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the role of the program's training and {{technical assistance}} and to explore other contributing factors in changing school policies, practices, and environments. MethodsWe analyzed interim progress of schools recruited during the 2007 - 2008 and 2008 - 2009 school years as of December 2010. Schools reported progress through an online inventory of policies, practices, and school environment. We compared baseline inventories to the most recent follow-up and tracked both training attendance and contact with national experts. To identify the factors associated with progress, we performed regression analysis on school level and <b>demographics,</b> <b>number</b> of months between baseline and follow-up, and technical assistance. ResultsThe amount of training and technical assistance was significantly associated with school progress, controlling for school level and <b>demographics,</b> <b>number</b> of months between baseline and follow-up, and school status at baseline. Although all types of schools saw progress, schools in the South had the most progress and urban schools had the least progress.

40|$|Background: Although {{foreign body}} {{ingestion}} {{is a common}} problem, poor knowledge for the treatment still remains a major obstacle, especially in preventing complications. Phosphate enemas were applied for chronic constipation {{for a long period}} of time. This study aims to evaluate the effect of a single dose of phosphate enema on bowel movements in patients who suffer from foreign body ingestion. Materials and Methods: Forty consecutive patients admitted to our emergency unit for foreign body ingestion were randomized into two groups. Patients in both groups were followed up with daily imaging and physical examinations. Cases in Group SP received daily doses of sodium phosphate enemas, while Group C did not. <b>Demographics,</b> <b>number</b> of X-rays, radiation dose, and period of the foreign body passage were recorded and compared between two groups. Also, data of patients who ingested pins (Group P) were compared with of those who ingested other materials (Group O). Results: There was no statistical difference between groups (Group SP vs. Group C and Group P vs. Group O) comparing <b>demographics,</b> <b>number</b> of X-rays, total amount of radiation doses (p > 0. 05 for all comparisons). The period of foreign body passage was shorter in Group SP (3. 4 ± 1. 6 days vs. 6. 2 ± 3. 8 days; p = 0. 005). Also, patients who ingested pins were compared to patients who ingested other materials. Pins were ingested by 23 (65 %) patients. These were older (16. 6 ± 9. 4 years vs. 4. 8 ± 3. 5 years; p = 0. 001) and generally females (78. 3 % vs. 29. 4; p = 0. 006). Contrary to the other cases, pins were less frequently confirmed in stool in patients who ingested pins (p = 0. 02). Conclusion: A single dose of phosphate enema use may hasten the passage of the foreign bodies. Ingestion of pins is the more common especially in young females. The evacuation of pins is generally recognized with direct examination of the stool, so daily imaging may not be necessary for this group of patients...|$|R

30|$|The {{study area}} was {{stratified}} into two regions namely Dhur and Choekhortoe. The stratification was done because these two regions are isolated {{from each other}} and their grazing and resource collection sites are delineated since ancestral times. Dhur has two villages consisting of 17 herders who do not own registered land and are therefore totally dependent on yak and sheep husbandry. Choekhortoe has seven villages with 21 semi-nomads who rear yaks and also conduct off-herd activities. The survey took into account all 38 herders of WCNP and had the opportunity to meet heads of all herds. The questions asked includes household <b>demographics,</b> <b>number</b> of livestock owned, herding pattern, livelihood strategies, number and type of livestock lost to predation and income lost from depredation. The standard pre-tested questionnaires were administered to collect the data. Moreover, interviews were all conducted by WCNP park staff who have worked with these communities for several years. This is expected to minimize likelihood of receiving inaccurate responses. Demographic and livelihood data were cross-validated with the district veterinary office of Bumthang Dzongkha. 2 The information on livestock lost to predation and the herding practices was validated with the records maintained at the park head office.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIsrael’s 1967 {{victory in the}} Six-Day War ironically led to persistent and pervasive struggle. In addition to international scrutiny, regional uncertainty, and the management of an occupied Palestinian population, Israel has been engaged in an internal struggle revolving around settlement of the occupied territories. Religious Zionism constitutes one faction within this struggle. Religious Zionism is a middle-road ideology between secular Zionism, founded by Theodore Herzl in 1897, and the traditional rabbinic teaching that rejects human efforts to secure {{a return to the}} ancient land of Israel. Religious Zionism is founded on the belief that Jews have an obligation to return to Israel; such a return is considered a divine commandment. The occupation created the conditions for the religious Zionist movement to force a clash with the secular Israeli government. Religious Zionists wanted to possess and settle the newly occupied territory regardless of national security concerns. I argue that the small religious Zionist movement has had significant influence over the settlement policies of the Israeli government disproportional to its <b>demographic</b> <b>numbers,</b> an influence whose consequences extend to the fate of the peace process {{and the future of the}} Middle East.
