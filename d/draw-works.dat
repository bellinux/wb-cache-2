5000|$|A modern <b>draw-works</b> {{consists}} of five main parts: the drum, the motor(s), the reduction gear, the brake, and the auxiliary brake. The motors can be AC or DC-motors, or the <b>draw-works</b> may be connected directly to diesel engines using metal chain-like belts. The {{number of gears}} could be one, two or three speed combinations. The main brake, usually operated manually by a long handle, may be friction band brake, a disc brake or a modified clutch. It serves as a parking brake when no motion is desired. The auxiliary brake {{is connected to the}} drum, and absorbs the energy released as heavy loads are lowered. This brake may use eddy current rotors or water-turbine-like apparatus to convert the kinetic energy of the moving load to heat and dissipate it.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>draw-works</b> is {{the primary}} {{hoisting}} machinery that is a component of a rotary drilling rig. Its main function {{is to provide a}} means of raising and lowering the traveling blocks. The wire-rope drilling line winds on the drawworks drum and extends to the crown block and traveling blocks, allowing the drill string to be moved up and down as the drum turns. The segment of drilling line from the <b>draw-works</b> to the crown block is called the [...] "fast line". The drilling line then enters the sheaves of the crown block and it makes several passes between the crown block and traveling block pulleys for mechanical advantage. The line then exits the last sheave on the crown block and is fastened to a derrick leg {{on the other side of}} the rig floor. This section of drilling line is called the [...] "dead line".|$|E
5000|$|A blue mist {{formed at}} night in the hollows of the low hills caused by gas pockets. One night the {{poisonous}} effects of gas collecting in a depression killed two drillers and three Iraqi workers. The risk of fire was ever-present as for hundreds of metres around everything was smothered in oil. Men were working in gas masks almost naked in an endeavour to get near enough to set up some control appliances. The oil fell evenly in clouds all around the derrick and <b>draw-works</b> due to the windless autumn days. Eventually, the cloud of oil was blown away {{from one side of the}} derrick to allow work to start on the well head by using an aero engine.|$|E

The PLC (ET 200 S) is configured with a controller architecture that regulates the motor angular displacement and velocity through actuation of the servo valves. Furthermore, a graphical user interface is developed for operation of the AHC system. The HIL test allowed tuning of the physical controller in terms of heave stabilization and positioning. The conclusion after the testing is a PLC which is ready for operation without necessitating the use a physical prototype of the process...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present an approach in developing a virtual active heave compensation system for a <b>draw-works</b> on a hoisting rig. A virtual system enables quicker overall product development time of a physical system as well as flexibility in optimizing the design parameters. Development of the virtual system started with the modelling of the <b>draw-works</b> and hoisting rig dynamics. Simulations of this model were run in two operational modes while subject to a sinusoidal wave: heave compensation and seabed landing of a payload. The results were analyzed and used for optimization in terms of cost and performance. This lays the groundwork for further testing either through hardware-in-the-loop testing (HIL) or using an actual prototype...|$|E

40|$|In managed {{pressure}} drilling (MPD) operations, {{the well}} is sealed and mud pressure {{is controlled by}} opening/closing the valve that releases the mud {{at the top of}} the well. This technology has proven successful when drilling from stationary platforms. Managed Pressure Drilling from floaters brings about several challenges. In normal drilling, heave motion of the floater (due to waves) is compensated by the <b>draw-works</b> and the drill string is not affected by heave. During drill string connection, however, the drill string is disconnected from the <b>draw-works</b> and gets rigidly attached to the floater. Thus the drill string follows the heave motion of the floater thus moving back and forth in the well and acting like a piston. This generates large pressure fluctuations, which can damage the well. These pressure fluctuations must therefore be fully or at least partly compensated by active control of the top-side choke. Previous attempts to achieve such compensation, although successful in simulations, failed in full scale tests. Objective The objective of this project is to study the problem of Managed Pressure Drillin...|$|E
