5|$|All North American Drosera species {{except for}} D. anglica have a {{chromosome}} count of 2n=20. In 1955, Wood noted that D. anglica had a chromosome count of 2n=40, and hypothesized that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> hybrid amphidiploid origin. Since the leaf morphology of D. anglica is an intermediary between that of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis {{and the two}} occur sympatrically in several locations, Wood conjectured that D. anglica likely originated from a hybrid between these two.|$|E
5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also {{highly correlated with}} the presence of sheep. This is thought to be because of the frequency of dead animals, which can be an important source of food. Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{continued}} with his career. In March 1938 {{he was called}} to readiness with 604 Squadron during the Munich crisis. At this time the squadron was flying the Hawker Demon. He was displeased when they converted to the Bristol Blenheim. The machines were fitted with a tray of four 303 Browning machine guns to give forward-facing firepower. As a long-range fighter <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> dubious value. The German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 could, and would, expose the frailties of the aircraft which was originally intended as a bomber. However, Cunningham {{was told by the}} Air Ministry that it would be sufficient in the night fighter role, which is where they intended to use this variant. On 20 April 1938, John returned to de Havilland test-flying de Havilland Moth Minors.|$|E

5|$|Edwin's {{defeat and}} death caused his kingdom to {{fragment}} into {{at least two}} parts. It also led to {{a sharp decline in}} Christianity in Northumbria when Edwin's immediate successors reverted to paganism. Although Paulinus' deacon, James, remained in the north and struggled to rebuild the Roman mission, Edwin's widow decided to return to Kent. Paulinus went with her, taking Edwin and Æthelburg's son and daughter, as well as one of Edwin's grandsons. The two boys went to the continent for safety, to the court of King Dagobert I. Æthelburg, Eanflæd, and Paulinus remained in Kent, where Paulinus was offered the see, or bishopric, of Rochester, which he held until his death. Because the pallium did not reach Paulinus until after he had left York, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> no use to him.|$|E
5|$|In Roman Britain Cumbria was the {{territory}} of the Carvetii. As the site of the western part of Hadrian's Wall, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> strategic importance. The north of the county is rich in archaeological evidence from the period, but nothing is known that suggests any Roman habitation in the Keswick area, other than finds that point to the existence of one or more Roman highways passing the vicinity of the present-day town. Such nearby settlements as can be traced from the era of the Romans and the years after their departure seem to have been predominantly Celtic. Many local place names from the period, including that of the River Derwent, are Celtic, some closely related to Welsh equivalents.|$|E

In October 1860 for instance, De Soto reported the interception at Sierra Morena, Cuba of an illegal slave ship carrying 800 African slaves. The captain and crew of the slave ship were detained by local authorities, but about 400 of the slaves had already been dispersed ashore {{and could not be}} retrieved.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur's {{decision}} to move swiftly against Finschhafen, coupled with Blamey's to envelop the Japanese defences by landing at Scarlet Beach, and Yamada's to avoid a decisive engagement that might result {{in the loss of}} all or part of his force, gave Windeyer the time and space he needed to take Finschhafen.

5|$|On 17 November 1184 Coutances was {{translated}} to {{the diocese of}} Rouen, becoming Archbishop of Rouen. The original election to Rouen {{had taken place in}} the summer. King Henry had initially rejected the Rouen cathedral chapter's nominees and put forward three English bishops as the royal candidates. The king also indicated his preference that Coutances be elected, a choice that was confirmed by the pope in November. Coutances hesitated about the translation to Rouen, as the see there was poorer than Lincoln, but as an archbishopric rather than a bishopric <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> a higher status. The medieval chronicler William of Newburgh wrote that eventually Coutances' ambition overcame his greed, and he agreed to the translation. He was received at Rouen on 3 March 1185. Coutances remained in Henry's service however, and continued attend the royal court frequently. During the final 10years of Henry's reign, only Ranulf de Glanville witnessed more royal charters, and only William de Humez, the constable, equalled the 16charters that Coutances witnessed.|$|E

5|$|Si Tjonat was {{released}} in 1929.

The film was one in a line of domestic production targeted primarily at ethnic Chinese audiences, following Lily van Java and Setangan Berloemoer Darah (both 1928); film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that this was evident from the predominantly Chinese production team and cast. Native audiences also enjoyed the film, particularly its action sequences. Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> distinctly commercial orientation, meant only to turn a profit.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Baltic Front {{launched}} an artillery barrage at {{the positions of}} the 2nd Battalion, 45 Waffen SS Grenadier Regiment (1st Estonian) covering the German right flank in the village of Nõo southeast of Tartu on 23 August. The Soviet 282nd Rifle Division backed by the 16th Single Tank Brigade and two self-propelled artillery regiments bypassed the defence on the west side and captured the Kärevere Bridge across the Emajõgi River west of Tartu. Being one of only four bridges across the 100 kilometres long marshy floodplains of the river, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> high strategic importance. After sappers failed to destroy the bridge, Sturmbannführer Leon Degrelle improvised a defence line of the 5th SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade Wallonien, avoiding a Soviet breakthrough to Tartu.

5|$|After {{securing}} {{control over}} the Commonwealth, Báthory {{had a chance to}} devote himself to strengthening his authority, in which he was supported by his chancellor Jan Zamoyski, who would soon become one of the king's most trusted advisers. Báthory reorganised the judiciary by formation of legal tribunals (the Crown Tribunal in 1578 and the Lithuanian Tribunal in 1581). While this somewhat weakened the royal position, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> little concern to Báthory, as the loss of power was not significant in the short term, and he was more concerned with the hereditary Hungarian throne. In exchange, the Sejm allowed him to raise taxes and push a number of reforms strengthening the military, including the establishment of the piechota wybraniecka, an infantry formation composed of peasants. Many of his projects aimed to modernize the Commonwealth army, reforming it in a model of Hungarian troops of Transylvania. He also founded the Academy of Vilnius, the third university in the Commonwealth, transforming a prior Jesuit college into a major university. He founded several other Jesuit colleges, and was active in propagating Catholicism, {{while at the same time}} being respectful of the Commonwealth policy of religious tolerance, issuing a number of decrees offering protection to Polish Jews, and denouncing any religious violence.|$|E
5|$|Further {{excavations}} were {{undertaken in}} the 1920s by C. R. Peers, who found that the nave of the original church had external doors on the north, south and west sides, and that the chancel had doors leading into {{the north and south}} porticus, which in turn had external doors on their eastern sides. Regarding the floor described by Dowker, Peers noted that the surface consisted of a thin layer of pounded brick, and believed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> the same date as the stone which Dowker described as the foundations for the stone cross. Excavations also revealed steps leading down to the burial vault reported by Dowker, although Peers did not refer to either the steps or the vault in his report. Extensions of the porticus to the west and around the original west front were dated to no more than 100years after the church was first built, and Peers observed that these extensions had been given the same type of floor as the original church. Drawing comparisons with the 7th-century chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall at Bradwell-on-Sea, in Essex, and the abbey of St Augustine at Canterbury, Peers suggested that the original church at Reculver probably had windows set high in the northern and southern walls of the nave. Areas of wall found by archaeologists but now missing above ground are marked on the site by strips of concrete edged with flint.|$|E
