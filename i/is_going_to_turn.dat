500|$|On {{the flip}} side, the 2003 song [...] "Life Got Cold" [...] by UK girl band Girls Aloud {{received}} attention due to {{similarities between the}} guitar riff and melody of [...] "Life Got Cold" [...] {{and that of the}} song [...] "Wonderwall". A BBC review stated [...] "part of the chorus sounds like it <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> into Wonderwall by Oasis." [...] A source told The Sun that Girls Aloud [...] "are all big Oasis fans so I'm sure they won't mind comparisons with their classic love song." [...] Warner/Chappell Music has since credited Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher.|$|E
500|$|Burton's {{portrayal}} of Dylan has been generally well received. The character's romance with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), however, garnered a negative response from viewers and critics alike. Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that their storyline was [...] "everyone’s favorite storyline for curing insomnia". Despite negative reviews, Burton's portrayal during the storyline was praised, specifically by journalist Connie Passalacqua Hayman, who wrote: [...] "But it was Steve Burton as Dylan who {{stole the show}} with Dylan’s tearful and very sensitive reaction to the news, as his character loves what he believed to be his baby very much." [...] When {{the truth about the}} paternity of Chelsea's child was revealed, Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps remarked (in reference to Burton), [...] "When the truth came out it provided some meaty material for this fan favorite." [...] Sara Bibel of Xfinity gave a mixed review when Dylan was revealed as Nikki's son, writing: [...] "However, the foreshadowing that Dylan (Steve Burton) <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> out to be Nikki’s long-lost son is so heavy-handed that it seems hard to believe that the show is going in any other direction. Dylan is the right age. He looks like he could be related to Nikki. The character is in desperate need of a more ties to the canvas; being Avery’s ex is not enough to keep him in town, much less front-and-center. My big objection to this twist is, what’s the actual story? We have spent months learning every single thing about this character who probably would not exist if Y hadn’t {{jumped at the chance to}} poach Burton from GH." [...] She added: [...] "Dylan would get a mother to replace his father that passed away. Nikki would get a child who can use his carpentry skills to build her a nice bookcase. That’s sweet, but it’s a situation, not a plot. There really aren’t any consequences. Nick would be angry that the guy he’s convinced Avery still loves is his half-brother, but he already has one half-brother he despises. Another one really isn’t a big deal." [...] Burton's portrayal earned him a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2016.|$|E

[...] That would be a disastrous outcome not only for Israel, but also for the United States and especially the Palestinians.|$|E
