40|$|Web {{crippling}} {{may occur}} at the highly concentrated loading or reactions {{when there is no}} <b>end</b> <b>stiffener</b> or load stiffener in cold-formed, thin-walled steel members. A nonlinear finite-element analysis is carried out based on a series of laboratory tests on cold-formed steel channels subjected to web crippling under end-one-flange and interior-one-flange loading conditions as specified in the North American and Australian/New Zealand specifications for cold-formed steel structures. Geometric and material nonlinearities were included in the finite-element analysis. The finite-element results demonstrate that the ultimate load-carrying capacity (web crippling strength), web crippling failure modes, and web deformation curves agree well with the tests. The verified finite-element models are then used for an extensive parametric study of different channel dimensions. It is found that the design strengths calculated from the North American Specification are generally unconservative for channel sections with unstiffened flanges having web slenderness ranging from 7. 8 to 108. 5 subjected to web crippling under the end-one-flange and interior-one-flange loading conditions. Therefore, the updated coefficients of the design formula in the North American Specification and new design formulas are subsequently proposed in this paper. It is demonstrated that the verified finite-element models provide an effective and time efficient means to predict web crippling strengths of cold-formed steel members. © 2006 ASCE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Panels of {{aluminum}} alloy sheets, framed by side and <b>end</b> <b>stiffeners,</b> {{were subjected to}} combined loading by means of offset knife edges applying loads to top and bottom end plates with reacting forces against the end plates supplied by laterally acting rollers. The test specimens were 17 S-T aluminum alloy shoots 0. 040 inch thick in panels of 10 -inch width and three different lengths (approximately 10, 26, and 30 inch). Data were obtained for the bowing of transverse and longitudinal ribs of rectangular cross section and varying depths mounted {{on one side of}} the sheet only, for several ratios of compression to shear loads. Limiting values of the moments of inertia were calculated from these measurements.

40|$|Most {{structures}} {{especially the}} conventional steel buildings are usually using the simple design and rigid design methods. However, the actual behaviour {{is known to}} fall between these two extreme categories. The use of partial strength connections has been encouraged by studies on the matter. It is proven that it reduces the steel weight in use and thus save the overall construction cost. This project is to analyze the behaviour of trapezoidal web beam profiled to the end plate connection. Comparison between the effect of trapezoidal web beam profiled to end plate connection and stiffener is made to predict the strength, stiffness and rotational capacity of the connections. Previous {{research shows that the}} trapezoidal web beam profiled will minimize the need of stiffeners. Six models have been analyzed in this project by using LUSAS 14. 0 by various type of beam. The dimension of beam is 150 x 200 x 1600 mm whereas for column is 200 x 200 x 1800 mm. The dimension for the <b>end</b> plate <b>stiffener</b> provided is 95 x 95 x 10 mm.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a computationally efficient analysis method {{which was used}} to predict detailed stress states in a typical composite compression panel with a discontinuous hat stiffener. A global-local approach was used. The global model incorporated both 2 D shell and 3 D brick elements connected by newly developed transition elements. Most of the panel was modeled with 2 D elements, while 3 D elements were employed to model the stiffener flange and the adjacent skin. Both linear and geometrically nonlinear analyses were performed on the global model. The effect of geometric nonlinearity induced by the eccentric load path due to the discontinuous hat stiffener was significant. The local model used a fine mesh of 3 D brick elements to model the region at the <b>end</b> of the <b>stiffener.</b> Boundary conditions of the local 3 D model were obtained by spline interpolation of the nodal displacements from the global analysis.

40|$|Summary. [...] The {{purpose of}} this report is to provide {{experimental}} resuKs for comparison with theoretical analyses of stress diffusion problems. The structures considered consist of plane reinforced sheet which has been assumed not to buckle. Symmetrical loads are applied to the edge booms connected to the sheet by continuous no-slip joints. Attention is concentrated on the stress distribution near {{the ends of the}} parallel strips of plate. -An outline of the existing theoretical work which is applicable to this type of problem is given. The stringer-sheet theory, the only one capable of dealing adequately with unreinforced sheet, is compared with the photoelastic results. It is shown that the stringer-sheet theory overestima[tes the peak shear stresses near the corners of the strips and consequently also the rate of diffusion of load from boom to sheet. It is also shown that the experimental shear stresses [...] are in reasonable agreement with those predicted by a more exact plane-stress theory. This theory predicts that the peak shear stress in the plate is 2 / = times the direct stress in the boom {{at the end of the}} panel. However, with the type of joint considered here, the maximum shear stress is likely to be much higher than the value given by this prediction. Some attention is also given to transverse <b>end</b> <b>stiffeners</b> and it would seem that these normally have very little effect on the shear stresses. • The photoelastic models were made from the Allylstrene plastic called C.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Ritz method for the elastic buckling analysis of shells with ring-stiffeners under general pressure loading. The stiffeners {{may be of}} any cross-sectional shape and arbitrarily distributed along the shell length. Using polynomial functions multiplied by boundary equations raised to appropriate powers as the Ritz functions, the method can accommodate any combination of end conditions. As far as it is known, the Ritz method has not been automated in this way for the buckling of ring-stiffened shells. By formulating in a nondimensional form, generic buckling solutions for shells with various <b>end</b> conditions, <b>stiffener</b> distributions and under various pressure distributions, were presented. These new buckling solutions should serve as useful reference sources for checking the validity and accuracy of other numerical methods and software for buckling of cylindrical shells.

40|$|A {{model to}} predict the {{acoustic}} signature of a submarine resulting from the radial vibration of the hull under axial excitation is presented. The simplified physical model of the submarine hull includes complicating effects such the presence of bulkheads, <b>end</b> enclosures, ring <b>stiffeners</b> and fluid loading due to the interaction with the surrounding medium. Under an axial symmetric force, only the ‘breathing’ modes of the cylinder corresponding to the n= 0 circumferential modes are excited. To show the sound radiation due to the higher order n≥ 1 modes, a point axial force acting {{at one end of}} the shell has been considered. At low frequencies, the structural wavenumbers are generally subsonic.

Tsai-Wu failure criterion was used to detect the first-play-failure load. The effect of circular and diamond cutout shape and effective flange reinforcements were investigated. The results show that the cutout and reinforcement have little effect on the buckling stability.

40|$|Fatigue Cracking often {{occurs in}} {{composite}} bridges with unstiffened girder web gaps at the <b>ends</b> of transverse <b>stiffeners.</b> In this project, researchers sought {{to better understand}} bridge diaphragm deflection behavior and advance the ability to estimate web gap distortional stress. Trends from the parametric studies led to general observations that may assist in identifying fatigue-prone bridges. Variables that influence diaphragm deflection behavior include girder spacing, bridge skew, span length, and deck thickness. Transverse load distribution properties appear to play the most significant {{role in determining the}} magnitude of differential deflection. Parameter study stress trends indicate that out-of-plane distortional stress in fatigue prone web gaps primarily depends on web gap properties, bridge span length, and angle of skew. Differential deflection and web gap dimension trends apply to a varied spectrum of bridge configurations. The research resulted in a method to assess bridge girder differential deflection and distortional stress in actual steel bridges without complex analysis and modeling. Proposed procedures for evaluating out-of-plane stress should prove practical and aid in screening, identifying, and assessing bridges vulnerable to distortion -induced fatigue cracking.

40|$|A {{model to}} {{describe}} the low frequency dynamic and acoustic responses of a submarine hull subject to a harmonic propeller shaft excitation is presented. The submarine is modelled as a fluid-loaded, ring stiffened cylindrical shell with internal bulkheads and <b>end</b> caps. The <b>stiffeners</b> are introduced using a smeared approach. The bulkheads are modelled as circular plates and the end closures as truncated conical shells. The propeller introduces a harmonic axial force that is transmitted to the hull through the shaft. It results in excitation of the accordion modes only if the force is symmetrically distributed to the hull. Otherwise the excitation can be modelled as the sum of an axisymmetric axial force plus a moment applied {{to the edge of}} the hull to take into account the eccentricity of the force. This leads to excitation of the higher order circumferential modes that can result in high noise signature. Structural and acoustic responses are presented in terms of frequency response functions of the axial and radial displacements and directivity patterns for the radiated sound pressure.

40|$|AbstractFiber-Reinforced-Polymer (FRP) strips can be {{glued to}} the surface of {{concrete}} or masonry structures to improve their strength. Pull-out tests on FRP bonds have shown a progressive failure of the adhesive joint involving early-stage cracking parallel to the axis of the FRP stiffener, and an inclined crack initiating at the free <b>end</b> of the <b>stiffener</b> and extending into the quasi-brittle substrate in the latest stage. The subsurface crack produces a characteristic wedge-shaped spall. There is no consensus on the reasons for the transition from cracking along the bond to cracking within the substrate. Therefore a Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics model problem is presented here that accounts for and provides improved understanding of the formation of the subsurface crack. The boundary value problem is solved analytically using the distributed dislocation technique. Competition between crack extension along the adhesive joint and into the substrate is quantified using a quantized crack propagation criterion, whereby the crack does not advance in infinitesimal continuous increments, but instead in finite steps of length comparable to the characteristic dimensions of the material microstructure. The model predicts results that are in good agreement with experimental evidence...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} spatial and {{material}} variations on farfield sound radiation from carbon/epoxy composite beams were investigated. Specifically, {{the geometry of}} a single stiffener of carbon/epoxy embedded in a beam, periodically spaced stiffeners {{along the length of}} a beam, and single stiffeners of different materials embedded in beams were all investigated. Because of a lack of methods to sufficiently model the details of spatially varying material properties, experimental data were used to identify important parameters that needed to be included in a model. Vibration testing was performed for three frequency ranges: 500 Hz to 1500 Hz, 1500 Hz to 2500 Hz, and 2500 Hz to 3500 Hz. The geometry of a single stiffener of carbon/epoxy affected the region of the stiffener that radiated sound. Periodically spaced stiffeners tended to have a global stiffening effect at lower frequencies and to act like individual stiffeners for frequencies where the wavelength is shorter than the stiffener. A stiffener of viscoelastic material reduced the sound power radiated from the region of the stiffener, and stiffeners of other materials radiated sound from the <b>ends</b> of the <b>stiffener.</b> Vibration experiments were performed on fiber-reinforced composite beams to verify a cubic spline based solution of a simple Euler-Bernoulli beam model. The model seemed to accurately predict the shape and location of farfield sound radiation from stiffeners. However, limitations on the available boundary conditions prevented accurate prediction of the magnitude of sound radiation. The model was then used to predict sound radiation from beams with varying stiffener bond lengths and these results were experimentally verified. In general a longer stiffener bond length causes less sound radiation. However, {{there seems to be a}} critical length at which the sound radiation reaches a maximum...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to address}} a number of {{unanswered}} questions regarding repair and fatigue design of welded joints in bridges, including developing and evaluating repair methods for enhancing the fatigue behaviour of web stiffeners in steel bridge girders, using local stress-based methods for evaluating the effectiveness of various repair methods and predicting the fatigue life of welded joints, and studying the effectiveness of high frequency mechanical impact (HFMI) treatments under actual in-service loading conditions in the long fatigue life regime. Along with extensive fatigue testing programs and finite element (FE) analyse studies, a strain based fracture mechanics (SBFM) model is used to predict the fatigue behaviour of repaired welds under realistic loading conditions. Through this research, a methodology is developed for generating structural stress design curves for retrofitted highway bridge welds based on small-scale fatigue experiments, relatively simple and inexpensive fatigue tests of smooth specimens, conventional static materials tests, and laboratory measurements. The idea of retrofitting web <b>stiffener</b> <b>ends</b> in steel bridge girders susceptible to distortion-induced fatigue using adhesively-bonded fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) angles is introduced through this research. The proposed retrofit method is relatively cheap {{and easy to use}} and does not require deck removal or any other severe modification to the steel girder. Fatigue tests were conducted on specimens designed to model the conditions in the region between a web stiffener and a flange in a steel girder bridge. Fatigue life increases on the order of several hundred percent were achieved by implementing the proposed retrofit. A coarse FE analysis is used to predict the effectiveness of the proposed retrofit methods in terms of the reduction in the structural stress value. A comprehensive variable amplitude (VA) fatigue testing program and analysis was performed {{to address a}} number of concerns raised regarding the use of impact treatments for the fatigue enhancement of welds in the high cycle (> 10 million cycles) domain. The test results are then used to evaluate a number of available recommendations for the fatigue design of impact treated welds. The nominal, structural, and effective notch stress approaches are considered. An SBFM model was lastly used to predict the effectiveness of an HFMI treatment applied to welded details. The model is evaluated using the experimental results and found to be capable of predicting the fatigue lives for both the as-welded and impact treated specimens for all of the studied loading conditions. The idea of using the analytical structural stress S-N curves to predict the fatigue behaviour of welded joints with a similar load carrying condition welds was then explored...|$|R
40|$|Many filed {{inspections}} and steel bridge surveys report that steel plate girder bridges {{are more susceptible}} to corrode at the end due to the accumulation of the water at bearing region. This water pools at the bearing is the result of rain shower and water leakage from the construction joints, which cause the corrosion of bearing stiffener and nearby web. The statistical data shows that only in Japan in more than 70 % corroded steel bridges, corrosion was found near the girder ends, which is primarily due to very aggressive environmental and severe topographical conditions of Japan (Chapter 2). Corrosion at plate girder ends damages the bearing stiffener and nearby web locally and in most of the cases rest of the girder part remains intact. Bearing stiffeners have a very important role in resisting the compressive load. Moreover, besides resisting the compressive load bearing stiffeners are also designed as anchor to balance the horizontal component of tension field action developed in the exterior web and resist the moment transferred by the in plane bending. Thus, any significant damage on bearing stiffener and nearby web may cause the buckling/crushing near the bearing and may also cause a significant loss in the bearing and shear capacity. Further, some field inspection data regarding the steel bridge damages was also collected from the Pakistan (Chapter 3) to assess the feasibility of required action to deal with these steel bridges. The inspection data also depicts the similar plate girder ends damages as reported in Japan. As number old of steel brides are increasing day by day in Japan and all around the world and {{it is very difficult to}} replace the all old brides at the same time along with the construction of the new bridges due to many constraints, i. e. economy of the country, traffic switching problem, lack of expertise and resources, manpower and machinery etc. Moreover, many bridges may have the adequate capacity to be used (Chapter 1). Therefore, all the corroded and old bridges demand the proper evaluation to assess their current performance level e. g. residual bearing and shear capacity so that suitable measure regarding the repair, retrofitting or replacement of these steel bridges can be adopted. The present study focusesiion the experimental and analytical evaluation of bearing and shear capacity of corroded bridges affected by the end panel corrosion. The chapter 4 discusses the experimental program conducted on the large scale plate girder ends specimens, simulated with local corrosion damage on the bearing stiffener. In all, total five plate girder end specimens were used. On one specimen no damage is considered and regarded as the healthy specimen and on the rest of two pair, 50 % thickness of the bearing stiffener is reduced within the damage height “Dh” of 20 mm and 60 mm uniformly and non-uniformly starting from the top face of the bottom flange near the weld seam. The study reported that 20 mm damage height does not change either the ultimate capacity or buckling failure mode. However, a relatively large damage of 60 mm shift the buckling of the stiffener within the damage zones along with the normal buckling within the normal web buckling. The chapter 5 deals with the extension of study to evaluate the bearing capacity of the plate girder ends analytically. For this purpose the test results obtained through the experimental program (conducted and mention in chapter 4) are modeled in a powerful finite element (FE) software ABAQUS. The comparison of the experimental and analytical results are made in term of the load-displacement relationships and deformed buckling modes and analytical results show the good agreement. Four various damage groups, Stiffener damage only, stiffener damage plus the free web <b>end</b> damage, <b>stiffener</b> damage plus interior web damage and stiffener damage plus the web damage at both side of the bearing stiffener were considered in the analytical program. Various residual thicknesses i. e. 75 %, 50 % and 25 etc. were assumed within the different damage heights zones. As the study is targeted to study the effect of the local damage, the maximum damage height is considered as 100 mm (10 % of girder height). True stress-strain relationships are determined by performing the tension test on the coupon cut from the used specimens with isotropic strain hardening rule are utilized in the analytical study. Initial deflections and welding residual stresses are also considered in the finite element (FE) study. Many trial analyses with different damage shapes and forms suggest that a simple uniform rectangular type of the damage with minimum thickness can be utilized in the FE simulation. Further, analytical results conclude that bearing stiffener has very important role in resisting the bearing load and any severe damage may reduce its radiusiiiof gyration along the week axis which may give rise to the stability problem by causing the buckling/ crippling failure at bearing. The results also revealed that the web damage alone does not affect the load carrying capacity significantly however; it reduces the load carrying capacity substantially when web damage is combined with the stiffener damage. The Chapter 6 describes the effect of local corrosion damages at the girder end on its shear capacity. An extensive analytical study is conducted on a four panel plate girder model and similar damage cases are assumed as considered (in Chapter 5) for the bearing capacity analysis. A mild steel with yield stresses equal to 345 Mpa with elastics perfectly plastics (EPP) characteristics under kinematics plasticity rule is used. A small initial out-of-plane deflection is also incorporated while; no residual stresses are considered in the study as they have no effect on the shear capacity. Analytical results indicate that a loss of the bearing stiffener more than 50 % can be fatal for the plate girder and it reduces the anchorage for the tension field action and thus refrains the girder to achieve its full post buckling strength. Also, complete loss of stiffener thickness shifts the failure mode of the girder from shear to buckling. The Chapter 7 comprises of some proposed empirical relationships to estimate ultimate capacity under the shear and compressive loads application. This section also discusses a proposed damage parameter named the “Reduced Thickness Ratio” to assess the buckling failure mode of the plate girder specimen under compressive loadFinally, Chapter 8 consists of a summary of conclusions and recommendations that are drawn from the above mentioned work. Subsequently some recommendations are also made for future research...|$|R
