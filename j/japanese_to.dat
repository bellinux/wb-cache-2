Thereby, Nanshin-ron, {{the concept of the}} Japanese Navy conducting a southern campaign quickly matured and gained further proponents.|$|E
5|$|At the Battle of the Bismarck Sea in March 1943, Whitehead {{was rewarded}} with an {{important}} victory over the Japanese. The battle caused the <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> abandon all further attempts to bring supplies and reinforcements in to Lae by the direct sea route from Rabaul. Whitehead was promoted to major general on 15 March 1943.|$|E

50|$|Shun'ichi Kase was a {{secretary}} <b>to</b> <b>Japanese</b> Foreign Minister Yōsuke Matsuoka in 1941. Then he was chargé d’affaires in Italy, as of 1943.

5|$|Mongolian has a complementizer {{auxiliary}} verb ge- {{very similar}} to <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> iu. ge- literally means 'to say' and in converbal form gež precedes either a psych verb or a verb of saying. As a verbal noun like gedeg (with n or case) it can form a subset of complement clauses. As gene it may function as an evidentialis marker.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had never}} before served in the Far East, as CEFEO commander, Leclerc was charged with {{recovering}} French Indochina. This territory, comprising the present day states of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, had been conquered by the French during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Vichy regime had allowed the <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> use Indochina as a base from which to attack the Allies in Malaya, Burma and China. On 9 March 1945, the Japanese had deposed the French colonial government, taken direct control of Indochina, defeated the French army in several engagements, and imprisoned surviving French soldiers.|$|E

5|$|An amphibious {{landing at}} Mersing was {{originally}} planned by the <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> sever {{the lines of}} communication between the British forces and Singapore, but the Southern Expeditionary Army Group decided to land the rest of the 18th Division at Singora instead, believing that the Allied defences at Mersing were too formidable. Although ground forces captured Endau on 21 January, they lacked the strength to break through the Australian defences at Sungei-Mersing.|$|E
5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started to climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, {{in an effort to}} win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese {{were on the verge of}} breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to isolate the battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would have prevented the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> overrun them.|$|E
5|$|Both Allied and Japanese {{naval forces}} {{continued}} to converge on 22 August {{and both sides}} conducted intense aircraft scouting efforts, however neither side spotted its adversary. The disappearance {{of at least one}} of their scouting aircraft (shot down by aircraft from Enterprise before it could send a radio report), caused the <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> strongly suspect that U.S. carriers were in the immediate area. The U.S., however, was unaware of the disposition and strength of approaching Japanese surface warship forces.|$|E

5|$|In late June 1942, the Allies {{decided to}} seize {{bases in the}} {{southern}} Solomon Islands {{with the objective of}} denying their use by the <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> threaten the supply and communication routes between the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. They also intended to use Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases to support a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. Admiral Nimitz committed much of the Pacific Fleet to the task, including three of his four carrier task forces. They fell under the command of the recently appointed Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, commander of the South Pacific Area.|$|E
5|$|In the {{resulting}} battle, both sides lost numerous warships in two extremely destructive surface engagements at night. Nevertheless, the U.S. succeeded in turning back {{attempts by the}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> bombard Henderson Field with battleships. Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented {{the majority of the}} Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal. Thus, the battle turned back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi, resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in their favor.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} action two weeks later, a larger force of U.S. Marines {{successfully}} crossed the Matanikau River, attacked Japanese forces {{under the command}} of newly arrived generals Masao Maruyama and Yumio Nasu, and inflicted heavy casualties on a Japanese infantry regiment. The second action forced the <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> retreat from their positions east of the Matanikau and hindered Japanese preparations for their planned major offensive on the U.S. Lunga defenses set for later in October 1942 that resulted in the Battle for Henderson Field.|$|E

She also confirms that Munei and other politicians {{use it as a}} front for a brainwashing facility to create an elite group of pure-blooded <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> take control of the country in the next generation and lead it into Munei's vision of a new Golden Age. The Solid State decided to eliminate Munei for interfering in its plans, but Munei was ignorant of the origin of the abduction infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell, who {{had limited}} {{communications}} with his division headquarters, {{was concerned that}} his force would be cut off by fierce and chaotic fighting at Sarimbun and Jurong to the south west, involving the Australian 22nd Brigade. Maxwell's force consequently withdrew from the seafront. This allowed the <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> land in increasing strength and take control of Kranji village. They also captured Woodlands, and began repairing the causeway, without encountering any Allied attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Big Six and {{the cabinet}} spent August 13 debating their {{reply to the}} Allied response, but {{remained}} deadlocked. Meanwhile, the Allies grew doubtful, waiting for the <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> respond. The Japanese had been instructed that they could transmit an unqualified acceptance in the clear, but in fact they sent out coded messages on matters unrelated to the surrender parlay. The Allies took this coded response as non-acceptance of the terms.|$|E
5000|$|Ferguson {{states such}} {{practices}} {{played a role}} in the ratio of <b>Japanese</b> prisoners <b>to</b> dead being 1:100 in late 1944. That same year, efforts were taken by Allied high commanders to suppress [...] "take no prisoners" [...] attitudes, among their own personnel (as these were affecting intelligence gathering) and <b>to</b> encourage <b>Japanese</b> soldiers <b>to</b> surrender. Ferguson adds that measures by Allied commanders to improve the ratio of <b>Japanese</b> prisoners <b>to</b> <b>Japanese</b> dead, resulted in it reaching 1:7, by mid-1945. Nevertheless, taking no prisoners was still standard practice among US troops at the Battle of Okinawa, in April-June 1945.|$|R
5000|$|The battle {{involved}} a <b>Japanese</b> plan <b>to</b> conquer Xuzhou, {{a major city}} in the East. However, the <b>Japanese</b> failed <b>to</b> consider the plans of generals Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, who planned <b>to</b> encircle the <b>Japanese</b> {{in the town of}} Tai'erzhuang. The Japanese operation started on 24 March. Overconfidence led the <b>Japanese</b> commanders <b>to</b> overlook the thousands of inconspicuous [...] "farmers" [...] in the area, who were affiliated with Li Zongren and cut communication lines and supplies, diverted streams, and ruined rail lines. By late March, supplies and fuels were being dropped from airplanes <b>to</b> <b>Japanese</b> troops, but the quantities were insufficient.|$|R

5|$|The Third Fleet's {{operations}} in the South China Sea were highly successful. It destroyed {{a large number of}} Japanese ships and aircraft, while losing relatively few of its own aircraft. Historians have judged the destruction of Japanese cargo vessels and oil tankers to have been the most important result of the raid. Subsequent attacks by Allied aircraft and warships forced the <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> cease sending ships into the South China Sea from April 1945.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{played a}} leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta {{conferences}} with the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and other Allies, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe's postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war. The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; causing the <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> surrender on September 2, ending World War II. Parades and celebrations followed in what is known as Victory Day, or V-J Day.|$|E
5|$|The {{advance on}} Finschhafen {{continued}} on 26 September. Since the Salankaua Plantation was still {{reported to be}} heavily defended, Windeyer attempted to force the defenders to withdraw. He started with attacks on two hills to the south west of the plantation. B and D Companies of the 2/15th Infantry Battalion attacked {{what came to be}} called Snell's Hill. It was captured in hand-to-hand combat using bayonets. The Australians captured three 13mm heavy machine guns and seven light machine guns, and buried the bodies of 52 dead Japanese defenders. The other feature, which came to be called Starvation Hill, was taken by C Company. However, their capture did not prompt the <b>Japanese</b> <b>to</b> leave the Salankaua Plantation.|$|E
