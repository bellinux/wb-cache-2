AbstractThe interpretation {{of the separation of}} federal judicial power derived from Chapter III of the Constitution is as hotly debated as it is fundamentally important. Two key viewpoints have emerged in this debate, formalism and functionalism. A formalist test focusing on definitional characteristics governs the permissible powers of federal courts.

40|$|It is a sacrosanct {{principle}} of the {{due process of law}} that the right of the accused to a fair trial should be observed. A condition precedent to that requirement is that he should be tried by an independent and impartial tribunal. Whilst the concepts of judicial <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> have been explored extensively in national jurisdictions, they have not been examined vis-à-vis the international arena. The {{increase in the number of}} international criminal tribunals corresponded with an increase in the size of the international judiciary. It is therefore vital that there remains in place, a body of uniformly applicable standards of international judicial <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> which would provide guidelines to international practice. The research undertaken raises interesting questions, such as the sources of these principles, the mechanism of their application in the national and international arenas, in particular to international criminal courts. It explores the relationships between the national and international standards and concludes that standards of <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> are applicable as of right to international criminal proceedings and validation through international human rights instruments, statutes and jurisprudence of the international criminal tribunals is not necessary. A comparative study has been made with national and international standards of fair trial, <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality.</b> It is the premise of this thesis that the latter two concepts are necessary for the guarantee of the fair trial right. Jurisprudence of regional, national and international courts was explored to support this aim with particular attention focussed on the international criminal tribunal and the permanent international court. Finally, a conclusion is formed on the <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> of the international judiciary and the efficacy of the international criminal judicial system in ensuring that the right of the accused to receive a fair trial. ...|$|R

50|$|In recent years, {{a former}} State's member Mr Stuart Syvret has argued in legal {{proceedings}} in England and Jersey that {{all members of}} the Jersey judiciary lack the appearance of <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality.</b> In March 2009, the High Court in London refused him permission to commence a judicial review claim against Home Secretary Jack Straw. In Jersey, subsequent proceedings related to a criminal prosecution for a data protection offence (he named a former nurse on his blog, who he said was guilty of murdering patients), judicial reviews and appeals relating to that criminal case, and a separate civil action brought by Syvret against fellow politicians and Law Officers in connection with his removal from office as minister for health. Syvret argues that he cannot have a fair trial in the island and {{there is a lack of}} appearance of <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> because judges are appointed by the Bailiff and the other judges have attended social events with the Bailiff.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of utilization of arbitration {{as a method}} of dispute resolution depends on the public confidence in the method. In this regard, the <b>independence</b> of arbitrators <b>and</b> their <b>impartiality</b> are necessary conditions for the realization of such confidence. <b>Independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> of arbitrators ensure a fair trial in arbitration and the lack of aforementioned features makes it impossible to trust the fairness of the dispute settlement process and its result. The importance of confidence in the health of the dispute settlement system is to the extent that many international instruments have frequently emphasised on the necessity of the two above-mentioned features. In the recent decade, contemporaneous with the incredible development of arbitration, the debate over <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> of arbitrator has become important and controversial because neither national laws nor international provisions provide a clear difinition of the said concepts. This article set out to explain the exact point that the <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> are distinct concepts and are not interchangeable with each other; Independence is concerned with the relationships between the arbitrator and disputing parties, while impartiality considers the arbitrator's conduct over the equal treatment with the parties. The aforesaid distinction includes such a legal effect that each of these two concepts shall be considered as an autonomous and separate cause for challenging arbitrators...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} {{driving this}} thesis is {{how should the}} separation of federal judicial power, derived from Chapter III of the Australian Constitution, be interpreted to best achieve the <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> of federal courts? The interpretation of Chapter III is as hotly debated as it is fundamentally important. Two key viewpoints have emerged in this debate: formalism and functionalism. A formalist test – strictly separating government powers according to definition – limits the permissible powers of federal courts. A functionalist test – hinging validity on whether a power is incompatible with institutional <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> integrity – limits the powers of State courts and of judges in their personal capacities (‘personae designatae’). A rare point of consensus between the two viewpoints is that the separation of judicial power derived from Chapter III should be interpreted {{in a manner that}} achieves its core purpose. This thesis identifies this purpose as judicial <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> <b>and</b> queries which interpretive approach can best achieve this aim, with a view to contributing to contemporary debates and guiding future developments in the area. The central argument of the thesis is that a new, hybrid approach called purposive formalism presents a legitimate and preferable interpretation of Chapter III, better able to achieve judicial <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> than either the existing formalist or functionalist tests. The thesis tests {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} formalist, functionalist and purposive formalist interpretations of Chapter III in two case studies. The first case study concerns powers conferred on federal courts under the anti-terrorism control order provisions of the Commonwealth Criminal Code (the ‘Code’), and contrasts formalist and purposive formalist approaches to assessing the Chapter III validity of these provisions. The second case study concerns similar powers conferred on judges personae designatae under the anti-terrorism preventative detention order provisions of the Code, and assesses the relative strengths and weaknesses of purposive formalism and the functionalist incompatibility test in this context. The study as a whole reveals serious weaknesses in the existing approaches. Purposive formalism is consistently supported, not as a perfect or ideal approach, but certainly as a preferable interpretation of Chapter III better able to achieve the <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> of federal courts...|$|R

In Western judicial systems, <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> are strictly connected to other important requirements, such as the judge's professional quality, effectiveness and the speed of judicial proceedings, not less than to the accountability of the judge himself. By consequence, the author maintains that the judicial function must always accommodate many other different needs {{of the political system}} as a whole, preserving not only judge's impartiality, but also the "reputation" of judge's impartiality. Moreover, the legitimacy of our magistracy as a professional order requires necessarily a social consent, which cannot be sustained without the perception of the <b>impartiality</b> <b>and</b> responsibility of the judges. The one outcome of the uncontrolled growth of judge's independence regardless of the <b>impartiality</b> <b>and</b> responsibility of this class of officials is the privileged status of Italian magistracy, which amounts to a true anomaly in our Western judicial systems...|$|R

40|$|The article elaborates on {{the lack}} of {{objective}} guarantees of <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> in the existing system of investment treaty arbitration. This founds a case for an international investment court to replace the existing system. The argument proceeds in three steps: (1) investment treaty arbitration is uniquely a form of public law adjudication, constituted at the international level; (2) as constituted it does not satisfy standards of <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> in public law adjudication; and (3) various reasons that might be offered to justify this failing are unsatisfactory in light of the importance of these standards. For this reason, states should be encouraged to establish an international investment court in accordance with well-known principles of judicial decision-making. Above all, alternatives to the existing system should be measured against the criteria that typically apply in public law, especially the related principles of openness <b>and</b> <b>independence.</b> Absent these criteria being met, one does not have a system that depoliticizes disputes and subjects them to the rule of law, or that warrants the utmost respect of all parties, above all developing states...|$|R
