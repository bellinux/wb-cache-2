5|$|As David Halberstam {{put it in}} {{his book}} Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made,Michael Jordan and David Falk helped make each other, and each profited to a {{remarkable}} degree from their special collaboration. It is true that Michael Jordan was the person who in the end actually did the deeds, went on the court and hit the final <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> again and again, but {{it is also true that}} David Falk helped revolutionize the process of representing a basketball player, going into a team sport and creating the idea of the individual player as a commercial superstar.|$|E
5|$|One notable Dream Shake {{happened}} in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With David Robinson guarding him, Olajuwon performed a cross-over, {{drove to the}} basket and faked a layup. Robinson, an excellent defender, kept up with Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a <b>jump</b> <b>shot.</b> Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup.|$|E

5000|$|In 11 seasons, Smith {{played in}} 865 games and logged 22,407 minutes. Smith was {{especially}} noted {{for his ability}} to hit <b>jump</b> <b>shots</b> from long range. His outside <b>jump</b> <b>shots,</b> often were taken from today's 3 point range. For his career, he recorded a [...]449 field goal percentage (4,776 FGs made out of 10,642 attempts). Smith also had a [...]798 free throw rate (1,307-of-1,637) and also accounted for 3,630 total rebounds, 1,734 assists and 10,882 points. Smith was known for his rainbow jumper, now utilized by other forwards such as Dirk Nowitzki.|$|R
5|$|In {{his second}} season with the Hawks, Abdur-Rahim {{achieved}} another personal milestone on December 28, 2002, when his <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> against the Washington Wizards made him the sixth-youngest player in NBA history to reach 10,000-points. Although Glenn Robinson, Jason Terry and Abdur-Rahim combined to average 57.9 ppg and become the highest-scoring trio in the league for the 2002–03 season, the Hawks {{failed to make the}} playoffs again. With an average of 19.9 ppg and 8.4 rpg, Abdur-Rahim played in {{all but one of the}} Hawks' games. By the end of the season, Hawks General Manager Billy Knight decided major changes had to be made for the franchise to move forward, and Abdur-Rahim was traded the next season.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003–04 season, the Spurs began {{featuring}} Ginóbili more regularly, starting him in {{half of the}} 77 {{regular season}} games in which he played. His statistics improved in all major categories, as he averaged 12.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game. During the 2004 playoffs, the Spurs met their perennial rivals, the Los Angeles Lakers, in the Western Conference Semifinals. Following Game 5 where Derek Fisher scored a buzzer-beating <b>jump</b> <b>shot,</b> the Spurs lost Game 6 and the series 4–2. While Ginóbili did not start in a single playoff game {{as he did in}} 2003, his playoff statistics improved significantly, with 13.0 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game.|$|E
5|$|Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8ppg respectively, the Lakers {{improved}} to 54–26 in 1961–62, {{and made the}} finals. In a game five victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61, despite fouling out of the game. The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven. Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game, missed a potential game-winning 18foot <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later.|$|E

5|$|Overtime {{began with}} a jump ball that was won by Kansas' Chamberlain, who quickly passed the ball to King. King took a <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> that missed and Carolina's Cunningham grabbed the rebound. The Tar Heels traversed the court and Bob Young managed to score a basket to give Carolina the edge. However, North Carolina was unable to stop Kansas during the ensuing drive as Chamberlain scored a basket to bring the score to 4848. After Kansas score the tying basket, North Carolina {{proceeded}} to hold the ball for one final shot before time ran out. Carolina's Kearns drove and put up a shot that was blocked by Chamberlain as time ran out.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{televised}} by CBS across the United States, which attracted over 17 million viewers. Georgetown jumped {{out to an}} early 1210 lead after twelve minutes of play, with eight of North Carolina's points coming from goaltending infractions by Ewing. The Hoyas entered halftime ahead by a single point, 3231. The teams traded the lead multiple times closing minutes of the second half. Following a turnover by Matt Doherty, Georgetown took the lead 6261 courtesy of a <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> from Floyd. During the ensuing possession, North Carolina Freshman Michael Jordan hit a go-ahead basket with fifteen seconds remaining to give North Carolina a one-point advantage.|$|E
5|$|The teams traded baskets for the {{majority}} of the second half, with the largest advantage being four points by Georgetown with over twelve minutes to go in the game. After five more minutes of game play, North Carolina managed to cut the lead to two, 56–54. The Tar Heels then obtained a single point lead with 5:50 to play and set up in their four corners offense,\ to run out the game clock. The Tar Heels were quickly fouled and Jimmy Black converted two free throws, while Fred Brown made two his own on the other end to bring the score to 59–58 in favor of North Carolina. With three and a half minutes left in the contest, Michael Jordan drove to the basket and made a shot off of the backboard to increase the Tar Heels' lead to three, 61–58. On Georgetown's following possession, Ewing made a <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> to bring his team within one. North Carolina again set up in the four corners. While making an attempt to steal the ball from Matt Doherty, the Hoyas' Eric Smith was called for a foul. This sent Doherty to the line for a one-and-one, which he missed and Ewing got the rebound. Smith then hit a twelve-foot <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> with 57 seconds left to go to give Georgetown the lead, 62–61. Then, Jordan received a pass from Black and connected on a shot with fifteen seconds remaining in the game to give North Carolina a one-point lead. On the Hoyas' ensuing possession, Fred Brown passed the ball away to Worthy, who proceeded to run out some of the clock before being fouled. Because the Hoyas were in the double bonus, Worthy received two free throw attempts, both of which he missed. Floyd got the rebound and attempted a last second shot that also missed.|$|E

50|$|Perimeter scoring—because the 2-3 zone often leaves {{some parts}} of the {{perimeter}} wide open for the opposing offense's long-range shooters, offenses that excel at 3-point <b>shots</b> and mid-range <b>jump</b> <b>shots</b> always have a chance to keep the score even (or, to build large leads). This is probably the 2-3's most obvious Achilles' heel.|$|R
5|$|At 0:35, {{the camera}} {{cuts to the}} {{aftermath}} of The Shot. A young man jumps {{in the air and}} pumps his fist as another young man in an opposing jersey sinks to the floor. The moment is from the 1989 NBA Playoffs, when Jordan hit a game-winning <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> over Cleveland Cavaliers guard Craig Ehlo. At 0:38 is Jordan's last shot with the Chicago Bulls, after a crossover dribble past Utah Jazz guard Bryon Russell at the end of Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. These scenes are musically punctuated with a bass drum roll and a cymbal crash. Finally, at 0:44 a young man shrugs after hitting a shot, as Jordan shrugged after scoring six three-point field goals {{in the first half of}} Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E
5|$|On December 2, 2013, Duncan {{became the}} oldest player {{to record a}} 20–20 game in NBA history, {{finishing}} with 23 points, 21 rebounds and the game-winning <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> against the Atlanta Hawks. The Spurs went on to conclude the 2013–14 regular season with a league-best 62 wins. The Spurs defeated Dallas in seven games {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, Portland in five games in the conference semifinals, and Oklahoma City in six games, where game 6 went into overtime, as the Spurs won, 112–107. They set up a Finals rematch against the Miami Heat, which they won, 4–1, setting a record margin for a win in the NBA Finals, for games 3 and 4. Along the way, the Duncan-Ginóbili-Parker trio broke the record for most wins in NBA Playoffs history. After winning the Finals in five games, Duncan joined John Salley as the only players to win a championship in three different decades.|$|E
5|$|Temple Owls {{started their}} {{season with a}} 62–56 home win against Seton Hall Pirates on November 12. Seton Hall last led with 8:15 in the first half, off a Herb Pope <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> to make the score 20–17. The Owls went on a 17–0 run to close the half. They led by up to 16 with 4 minutes and 16seconds left in the game, but Seton Hall scored the next 12 points to cut their deficit to four. Despite {{retaining}} most of their players from the 2009-2010 season, when they were the eighth-highest scoring team in Division I at 80.1 points per game, Seton Hall was held to 30 percent shooting by Temple Owls' defense. Juan Fernandez led Temple Owls with 12 points, and Rahlir Jefferson recorded his first double-double at 10 points and 10 rebounds. Owls player Lavoy Allen sat out much of the game with foul trouble. The Owls won their next game against Toledo 82–49. All five starters scored above nine, and Micheal Eric was the highest scorer, with 14 points.|$|E
5|$|His {{shooting}} accuracy {{combined with}} his long seven-foot frame and unique shooting mechanics, such as having a release point above his head, makes contesting his <b>jump</b> <b>shots</b> very difficult. Before {{the start of the}} 2011 NBA Finals, LeBron James called Nowitzki's one-legged fadeaway the second most unstoppable move ever, only behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook.|$|R
25|$|Hill {{spent most}} of his {{off-season}} working on his point-guard skills, supervised by player development coach Chad Forcier, and his <b>jump</b> <b>shots</b> with Spurs shooting coach Chip Engelland.

5|$|Before the 2003–04 season began, the Spurs {{lost their}} {{perennial}} captain David Robinson to retirement. Embracing the lone team leader role, Duncan led a reformed Spurs team which included Slovenian center Rasho Nesterovič, defensive stalwart Bruce Bowen, Argentinian shooting guard Ginóbili and young French point guard Parker. Coming {{off the bench}} were clutch shooting power forward Robert Horry, versatile Hedo Türkoğlu and veterans Malik Rose and Kevin Willis. In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant {{to step into the}} void, still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills. Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks, he led the Spurs into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard Derek Fisher hit a buzzer beater for an upset Lakers win. In the end, the Spurs lost the series 4–2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense as {{one of the reasons for}} the loss.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina's first {{possession}} of the second overtime period ended with a turnover, while Kansas missed a long <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> in theirs. North Carolina's Brennan boxed out Chamberlain who went over Brennan to collect the rebound and was called for over the back. Joe Quigg turned the ball over after traveling, while Chamberlain threw {{the ball out of}} bounds on the subsequent possession. Carolina failed to capitalize on Chamberlain's error when Kearns missed the front end of a one–and–one. Kansas came down the court and passed the ball to Chamberlain who was then fouled hard by Cunningham. This sparked an altercation between the two teams, which resulted in Chamberlain being hit in the stomach with a megaphone and his knee being scarred by a Carolina cheerleader. The referees stopped the commotion and Chamberlain was sent to the line, where he missed his shots, and Carolina got the rebound. The Tar Heels aimed to hold the ball for a final shot but they turned the ball over to Kansas with ten seconds to go and the Jayhawks called a timeout with six seconds left. The ball went to Kansas' Loneski who missed a shot and the game remained tied at 48.|$|E
5|$|With {{six minutes}} remaining, the Knicks began {{intentionally}} fouling any Warrior except Chamberlain, keeping {{the ball out}} of the center's hands. New York also began moving the ball slowly and using as much of the shot clock as possible to leave fewer opportunities for Chamberlain to score. Effectively, they played the opposite of what a normal club would do if they faced a deficit, willingly giving up many easy points instead of making attempts to rally back. Meschery said the Warriors lobbed the ball in from the sideline across the floor directly to Chamberlain, who would use his size and strength to get the ball. Chamberlain was the only Warrior to make a field goal in almost four minutes before Meschery made a <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> at 4:15. Philadelphia began quickly fouling New York with around four minutes left, reciprocating the intentional foul strategy. Warriors coach Frank McGuire at one point pulled out his entire starting five, save Chamberlain, and replaced them with bench players. The intention was to foul the Knicks, get the ball back after free throws and give Chamberlain the ball. Thus each team spent the last minutes fouling each other. The Warriors ended with 25 personal fouls, and the Knicks with 32, and lost Imhoff and Willie Naulls with six fouls.|$|E

5|$|After Kansas {{failed to}} convert a shot on their next possession, North Carolina {{proceeded}} {{to pass the}} ball {{around the perimeter of}} the court for close to two minutes. After finding the right setup, Lennie Rosenbluth drove to the basket and scored. Following that possession, Kansas began to make outside <b>jump</b> <b>shots.</b> When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved <b>jump</b> <b>shots</b> led to a 102 Kansas run, with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain in order to make him score from the free throw line, they began to get into foul trouble. Kansas' coach Dick Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with their next possession. Harp's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not able to overcome Kansas' three point lead; Kansas did not attempt a shot for over five minutes.|$|R

5|$|In the 1994–95 NCAA season, {{the sophomore}} was soon {{called one of}} the best {{eligible}} NBA prospects, along with his peers Joe Smith, Rasheed Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse. Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the 1995 NBA draft if he went early, but Duncan assured everyone {{he had no intention of}} going pro until he graduated, even though the NBA was planning to add a rookie salary cap in 1996. He was giving up a lot of money, but was determined to stay in school. In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game against a Rasheed Wallace-led North Carolina Tar Heels. During that game, Duncan neutralized the threat of Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> with four seconds left in overtime. In the NCAA Tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16, and playing against Oklahoma State, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying Bryant Reeves, but his team lost 71–66. Still, Duncan ended the year averaging 16.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year and became the third-best shot-blocker in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game. He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in each of his two remaining years at Wake Forest.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common shots {{that use the}} above {{described}} setup are the set shot and the <b>jump</b> <b>shot.</b> The set shot is taken from a standing position, with neither foot leaving the floor, typically used for free throws, and in other circumstances while the <b>jump</b> <b>shot</b> is taken in mid-air, the ball released {{near the top of}} the jump. This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender. Failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation.|$|E
25|$|On February 3, 2008, in a {{game against}} Florida State, Hansbrough broke Lennie Rosenbluth's 51-year-old school record for made free throws.
