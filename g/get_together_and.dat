5|$|In Deshastha {{families}} Ganeshotsav is {{more commonly}} known as Gauri-Ganpati because it also incorporates the Gauri Festival.In some families Gauri {{is also known as}} Lakshmi puja. It is celebrated for three days; on the first day, Lakshmi's arrival is observed. The ladies in the family will bring statues of Lakshmi from the door to the place where they will be worshiped. The Kokanstha Brahmins, instead of statues, use special stones as symbols of Gauri. The statues are settled at a certain location (very near the Devaghar), adorned with clothes and ornaments. On the second day, the family members <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> prepare a meal consisting of puran poli. This day is the puja day of Mahalakshmi and the meal is offered to Mahalakshmi and her blessings sought. On the third day, Mahalakshmi goes to her husband's home. Before the departure, ladies in the family will invite the neighbourhood ladies for exchange of haldi-kumkum. It is customary for the whole family to get together during the three days of Mahalakshmi puja. Most families consider Mahalakshmi as their daughter who is living with her husband's family all the year; but visits her parents' (maher) during the three days.|$|E

25|$|Ancient Rome {{has become}} an {{excavation}} site known for its rather extravagant cemeteries. All in all, the commoners and wealthy families of Rome were buried in the same cemeteries; the wealthy, however, had more elaborate tombs. The tombs of the wealthy were typically cut out of bedrock and rectangular in shape. These rectangular tombs resembled the Ancient Roman's house structure, having doors, and many different chambers. Of these chambers, {{one of them was}} used to hold the dead's memorial ceremony. During this ceremony, the family of the deceased would <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> have dinner. Other chambers were used to house anything thought necessary for the person laid to rest – including portraits of the deceased and any paraphernalia needed for the memorial ceremony that had yet to come.|$|E

500|$|The sisters {{found work}} in the film {{industry}} as backup vocalists, and immediately {{after graduating from high}} school, Jo worked on film soundtracks. The Stafford Sisters made their first recording,"Let's <b>Get</b> <b>Together</b> <b>and</b> Swing" [...] with Louis Prima, in 1936. In 1937, Jo worked behind the scenes with Fred Astaire on the soundtrack of A Damsel in Distress, creating the arrangements for the film, and with her sisters she arranged the backing vocals for [...] "Nice Work If You Can Get It". Stafford said that her arrangement had to be adapted because Astaire had difficulty with some of the syncopation. In her words: [...] "The man with the syncopated shoes couldn't do the syncopated notes".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} many cultural references, which Annalee Newitz of io9 {{attributed to the}} episode's writers: [...] "It was bound to happen that one day these four supernerds would <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> spawn an episode so packed with in-groupy pop culture references that smacking is probably in order." [...] Peter and Walter reference the 1984 supernatural comedy film Ghostbusters while investigating the opening scene's case, and later debate {{the origin of the}} term pyrokinesis, coined by author Stephen King in his 1981 novel Firestarter. Emmanuel Grayson refers to the titular character of the 1982 science fiction film , as well as Romulans and the United Federation of Planets, when describing government conspiracies to Peter and Olivia. Grayson also believes himself to be Mr. Spock. This reference is made even more appropriate by the fact that Spock's mother was named Amanda Grayson.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered Here We Go Again [...] "not {{quite as much}} fun", as Lovato's debut album Don't Forget, [...] "but still fun, particularly when Lovato tears into hooky power pop like ... 'Remember December'." [...] Erlewine also named the song {{one of the best}} tracks on the album. BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine rated it four out of five stars, and wrote, [...] "I'm sure there's a punkrock reason why we should all <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> hate it, but {{for the life of me}} I just can't. Even with the weird pronunciation and silly lyrics, this is a corker." [...] McAlpine praised the [...] "grand" [...] chorus and wrote: [...] "Someone in Team Lovato has been cocking an ear to the musical stylings of Paramore and maybe suggested that the next logical step after Camp Rocks wholesome Disneyfication of popular song might be something a little more confessional." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Don't Rush" [...] was {{originally}} written by Natalie Hemby and Blu Sanders in 2008. The idea of writing the song came from Hemby. She explained [...] "My friend Blu Sanders and I were together, and he goes, ‘Have you ever met Lindsay Champan?’ And I was like, ‘Nope!’ Basically he was like, ‘Why don’t we write with her? She has an absolutely gorgeous R voice.’ He was like ‘Let’s <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> {{see what we}} can develop." [...] Hemby also admitted that the song was written for Lindsay Chapman because the song's genre fit Chapman's musical direction at that time. She added, [...] "It had an Al Green-ish feel with a '70s throwback kind of vibe, and that's kind of what we were going for with her sound." [...] Once the collaboration was completed, the song was never recorded and Hemby said that it [...] "just kind of fell by the wayside". Being a good friend with Clarkson, Sanders decided to take the initiative to send the song with a few other songs to the singer.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Kings and Queens" [...] was {{directed}} by Jared Leto under the pseudonym of Bartholomew Cubbins. It was shot the weekend of October 11–13, 2009 in Los Angeles {{over the course of}} several nights, filming some of the city's most iconic landmarks. Leto explained, [...] "I think this city is a beautiful place at night, and we have these empty streets, and it's kind of a haunting, forgotten landscape... very serene." [...] The crew recruited scores of extras and all manner of surrealist street performers to appear in the video. On October 11, 2009, Thirty Seconds to Mars shut down Santa Monica Pier and filmed a segment of the short film along with a group of cyclists. Leto got the inspiration behind the video after some of his friends did Critical Mass and Crank Mob, [...] "groups of riders that <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> kind of reclaim public spaces and take over the streets in several cities around America," [...] and he thought that it would be the perfect backdrop for the music video of [...] "Kings and Queens".|$|E
500|$|Directed by Nick Marck, [...] "My Mother, the Fiend" [...] {{was written}} by Phil Klemmer and Dayna Lynne North. The episode marks Klemmer's eighth writing credit, the fifth and {{penultimate}} writing credit for North, and Marck's seventh directing credit. Despite being credited, Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Dick (Ryan Hansen), and Jackie (Tessa Thompson) do {{not appear in the}} episode. Among the episode's guest stars are Alyson Hannigan and Charisma Carpenter, who portray Trina Echolls and Kendall Casablancas, respectively. The two previously starred together in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with Hannigan playing Willow Rosenberg and Carpenter portraying Cordelia Chase. Although the two characters had appeared previously, they had never shared a scene together. Jason Dohring, who portrays Logan, stated that he had a special connection with Hannigan on-set: [...] "We <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> just tease each other, she sucker-punches me. There's just a total, I don't know, we really have a sister-brother thing going on. I've never had that kind of connection with an actress before. It totally works." [...] Dohring also noted that Hannigan responded strongly to any spoilers that she was given during filming of the episode.|$|E

500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, Lewis was {{inspired}} by house parties at Jonathan Wilson's Laurel Canyon home. [...] "We'd go to these jams in the canyon. They're fantastic. Jonathan invites older session musicians from the real Laurel Canyon era, and younger {{people who are just}} starting their bands who happen to live in the canyon, and we all <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> sing Grateful Dead covers and J. J. Cale songs." [...] Lewis herself has said that it [...] "rocks a little harder," [...] in contrast to Rabbit Fur Coats folk rock influences. Lewis also used Rilo Kiley's Under the Blacklight, which was notably polished compared to the band's earlier work, [...] "as a reference point to go in the complete opposite direction". She explained that every song she writes is [...] "a response to the thing that I've written before". [...] "It's even as simple as, 'OK, I've written a ballad, now I want to push myself to write something that's up tempo.' If I'm writing about myself, well, that subject can be tiresome, so then I focus on character-driven songs. So I'm always doing this back-and-forth just to keep myself interested." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Vig and Manson met at {{the funeral}} of Pablo Castelaz, the six-year-old son of Dangerbird Records founder Jeff Castelaz, and had a {{conversation}} where, according to Vig, [...] "we felt like we had some unfinished business, and we realized how precious life is and how important music has been in our lives." [...] Manson suggested calling guitarists Duke Erikson and Steve Marker to <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> write some songs. One week later, the group informally convened in Los Angeles, where they laughed, drank, and reminisced of the old days, leaving behind the tensions among them and general weariness that was partly responsible for their 2005 breakup; they set up their equipment and [...] "started fucking around." [...] "We were all pleased to notice {{on the first day}} there just didn't seem to be any personal tensions," [...] Vig recalled. [...] "Enough time had passed that any sort of weirdness or tension that had risen between us all had dissipated. So it was easy. There was no one telling us what to do. We weren't signed to a label. We were between managers. So we made this on our own terms." [...] In that session, the group wrote the song [...] "Battle In Me".|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, the {{negotiations}} {{allowed time for}} loyalists to enter Saigon and rescue the president. Khanh used the remaining communication lines to message senior officers outside Saigon. The Fifth Division of Colonel Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, a future president, brought infantry forces from Biên Hòa, a town north of Saigon. The Seventh Division of Colonel Trần Thiện Khiêm brought in seven infantry battalions and tanks from the Second Armored Battalion from Mỹ Tho, a town in the Mekong Delta south of Saigon. Khiêm was a Catholic with ties to Diệm's older brother, Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục. Khanh also convinced Lê Nguyên Khang, the acting head of the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps to send the 1st and 2nd Marine Battalions. Rangers were called into Saigon from the western town of Tây Ninh. Assistant Secretary of Defense Nguyễn Đình Thuận phoned Durbrow and discussed the impending standoff between the incoming loyalists and the rebels. Durbrow said [...] "I hope that the Revolutionary Committee and President Diệm can <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> agree to cooperate as a civil war could only benefit communists. If {{one side or the}} other has to make some concessions in order [...] reach an agreement, I believe that would be desirable to ensure unity against the communists." [...] Durbrow was worried that if he sided with one faction over the other, and that group was defeated, the United States would be saddled with a hostile regime.|$|E
