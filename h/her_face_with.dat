5|$|Artwork by Gee Vaucher and Penny Rimbaud, {{including}} {{a recording of}} the original 'Thatchergate Tape', featured {{as part of the}} 'Peculiar People' show at the Focal Point Gallery in Southend on Sea during the Spring of 2016, part of a series of events celebrating the history of 'Radical Essex'. Vaucher's painting 'Oh America', featuring an image of the Statue of Liberty hiding <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> her hands, was used as {{the front page of the}} UK Daily Mirror newspaper to mark the election of Donald Trump as US President on November 9, 2016. From November 2016 to February 2017 the Firstsite art gallery in Colchester, hosted a retrospective of Gee Vaucher's artwork.|$|E
5|$|The Pasha'a daughter, Murana, {{finds him}} hiding and orders her servant {{to assist in}} Jack's escape. Guards appear and {{announce}} that {{they are looking for}} the escaped prisoner, but they are turned away. Dressed up as a woman, Jack tries to have Murana flee with him. She says that one day she cannot marry him now, but she may come to his country one day. Jack trades a flower for his business card and departs. A year later, Jack and his mother have a visitor ushered and they stand in confusion at the beautiful young woman. Jack does not recognize her until she covers <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> her veil and she announces her intention to be his bride.|$|E
5|$|A pimp rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves her sexually. Number 18's {{father died}} when she was young and her family {{struggled}} to support her thereafter. Strangers took her from her home in Cambodia as a child, replaced her name with a number, and prostituted her in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of her clients are rich men, many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept in a dark room containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays for a man to come and save her from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and her pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> her skirt and plays with its hem.|$|E

5|$|The Pharisee Nicodemus {{supports}} Christ {{as he is}} lowered, and can {{be identified}} by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid {{to let go of}} her dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> the fold of her white headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the Magdalen is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green tabard at the feet of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate.|$|E
25|$|Unexpectedly, Renato arrives, and Amelia covers <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> her veil {{before he}} can {{recognize}} her. Renato explains to Riccardo that the conspirators are pursuing him, and his life is in danger. Riccardo leaves, making Renato promise to escort the veiled woman safely back to town, not asking her identity.|$|E
25|$|Alpheus, a river god, was in {{love with}} Artemis, but he realizes that he can do nothing to win her heart. So he decides to capture her. Artemis, who is with her companions at Letrenoi, goes to Alpheus, but, {{suspicious}} of his motives, she covers <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> mud so that the river god does not recognize her. In another story, Alphaeus tries to rape Artemis' attendant Arethusa. Artemis pities Arethusa and saves her by transforming Arethusa into a spring in Artemis' temple, Artemis Alphaea in Letrini, where the goddess and her attendant drink.|$|E

25|$|Portraits in marble include that of Costanza Bonarelli (executed around 1637), {{unusual in}} its more personal, {{intimate}} nature (in fact, {{it would appear}} to be the first fully finished marble portrait of a non-aristocratic woman by a major artist in European history). Bernini had an affair with Costanza, who was the wife of one of his assistants. When Bernini then suspected Costanza of involvement with his brother, he badly beat him and ordered a servant to slash <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a razor. Pope Urban VIII intervened on his behalf, and he was simply fined.|$|E
25|$|John Snow {{also studied}} chloroform, {{as much as}} he studied ether, which was {{introduced}} in 1847 by James Young Simpson, a Scottish obstetrician. He realised that chloroform was much more potent and required more attention and precision when administering it. Snow first realised this with Hannah Greener, a 15-year-old patient, who died on 28 January 1848 after a surgical procedure that required the cutting of her toenail. She was administered chloroform by covering <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a cloth dipped in the substance. However, she quickly lost pulse and died. After investigating her death and a couple of deaths that followed, he realized that chloroform had to be administered carefully and published his findings in a letter to The Lancet.|$|E
500|$|The promotional {{poster for}} Rise was {{released}} in early 2014. It features a close-up shot of <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> blonde hair and metallic eye shadow. Reveal magazine writer Brigitte Swimer deemed the photograph [...] "smouldering" [...] {{and went on to}} offer praise for Beyoncé looking [...] "breathtaking... rocking flawless skin and perfectly contoured cheeks". Brittany Talarico of People also reviewed the image positively, calling it [...] "sexy" [...] and noting [...] "one of her signature powerhouse stares as her hair blows wildly around her". Talarico concluded that the golden theme matched the perfume's bottle design.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{directed}} their commentaries of {{the music}} video towards Ferreira's increasingly risqué public persona, shifting from the more innocent image with which she launched her career. A writer from MuuMuse provided a favorable review, comparing it to the visuals for [...] "Criminal" [...] by Fiona Apple and summarizing that [...] "Sky Ferreira is cooler than anything you and I could ever be." [...] Becky Bain from Idolator stated that the appearance of Toby the Tarantula was [...] "somehow nowhere near as disconcerting as the image of Sky, looking washed out with platinum hair against a white background, crazily painting <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a tube of red lipstick." [...] Michael Cragg of The Guardian felt that Ferreira's friendship with the controversial Richardson showcased a [...] "shift away from the pop princess {{she felt she was}} being moulded into", and commented that the spider was [...] "not for the faint-hearted".|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was photographed}} by Harry Langdon in the {{swimming}} pool of the Jackson family's home. Jackson described Langdon as [...] "the sweetest man imaginable". She took inspiration from a photograph of actress Elizabeth Taylor submerged {{in a swimming pool}} which was taken early in her career. In the photograph, nothing could be seen apart from Taylor's face above the water; her body was hidden beneath the surface. Jackson thought the pose was dramatic and loved the fact that she could do the same thing, and not to have to reveal anything except for <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>With</b> the photographer, his assistant and other people around the pool, she was still reluctant to take off her robe, and stand there in her bathing suit. She waited until everybody got distracted to slip into the pool. After they took the photos, she waited until everybody was gone {{to get out of the}} pool.|$|E
500|$|The video commences with {{formally}} dressed spectators {{entering a}} museum as a curator introduces [...] "a creature so rare {{it was believed}} to be extinct. In captivity for the first time, the rarest creature on Earth, Avis Cyrus. White curtains are pulled down to reveal Cyrus, dressed in a black leotard and expansive black CGI wings, asleep in a giant bird nest locked inside a giant cage. Cyrus rises and approaches the audience, but a camera flash startles her and causes her to shield <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> her wings. The music starts, and Cyrus unveils herself again and joins a large group of feathered dancers. As Cyrus sings, she and the dancers escape the cage and prowl the museum, shattering museum exhibits as they pass them. They perform provocative dances both inside the cage and in darkened museum halls. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus lying down, dressed in a silver corset attached to a bed of peacock feathers, or writhing alone in her nest in the cage. The video ends with Cyrus back in her cage and the museum empty and trashed.|$|E

500|$|De Havilland {{was praised}} for her {{performance}} as Virginia Cunningham in Anatole Litvak's drama The Snake Pit (1948), {{one of the}} first films to attempt a realistic portrayal of mental illness and an important exposé of the harsh conditions in state mental hospitals, according to film critic Philip French. Based on a novel by Mary Jane Ward and produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, the film is about a woman placed in a mental institution by her husband to help her recover from a nervous breakdown. Virginia Cunningham {{was one of the most}} difficult of all her film roles, requiring significant preparation both mentally and physicallyshe deliberately lost weight to help create her gaunt appearance on screen. She consulted regularly with psychiatrists hired as consultants for the film, and visited Camarillo State Mental Hospital to research her role and observe the patients. The extreme physical discomfort of the hydrotherapy and simulated electric shock therapy scenes were especially challenging for the slight [...] actress. In her performance, she conveyed her mental anguish by physically transforming <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> furrowed brow, wild staring eyes, and grimacing mouth.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} {{performed}} at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance began with Gaga lying on the floor, on a set that was described as an ornate mansion. Gaga staggered across the stage and pirouetted behind a dancer in a lily-white wheelchair. She {{made her way to}} a white grand piano which she played by placing one foot up on the keyboard. Once again, she staggered across the stage, with theatrical blood dripping from her ribcage. She collapsed on the stage wailing in agony as one of the dancers gently lifted her. Gaga then hung liflessly with one hand rising above her dancers and blood smeared on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a golden halo being projected on the screen behind her. The ending climax of the performance pays homage to a similar-sounding ending climax in [...] "A Day In The Life" [...] by The Beatles. She later commented that the performance was for her fans: [...] "I wanted to say something honest and real and not just give a performance where I was jacking off on stage the whole time about my record," [...] It was really for my fans, who I knew would be at home cheering and swooning." [...] In a poll conducted by Billboard, the performance was ranked as the fourth best in the history of MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|Marie: Julien visits Marie and Simon's old apartment, {{where the}} letting agent shows him {{a room that}} Julien chillingly {{recognises}} — it {{is identical to the}} room Marie has prepared. This is where Marie hanged herself, trying to frame Simon in revenge after a terrible row. Julien returns home and Marie silently leads him to the attic where she has prepared a noose, feeling she has to hang herself again. Julien carries her downstairs, and they make love again. She leaves to meet Adrienne, who says that she knows that Marie no longer wants to die. They agree they do not know the rules of their situation. Returning, Marie interrupts Julien about to hang himself {{in a desperate attempt to}} join her. He runs to the kitchen and tries to slit his wrist; Marie stops him and her wrist and his palm are cut. Marie warns him that he will lose all memory of her, but he says that all he wants is for her to be there. Marie slowly covers <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> her hands —"the forbidden sign"— and Julien becomes oblivious to her and unaware of why he is bleeding. Madame X arrives for her letter and he hands it over, confused by her enquiries about [...] "l'autre personne". Madame X burns the letter, freeing Adrienne. Marie cries while watching Julien sleep, and as her tears land on her wrist her cut bleeds. Julien wakes and asks who she is; she replies that she is [...] "the one he loved". He doubts it as she's [...] "not his type", but she says with a smile to give her a little time.|$|E

2500|$|In the San Francisco Examiner, David Armstrong {{said the}} film [...] "benefits from its lush period costumes and {{settings}} but gains even more from an accomplished cast of British film and stage actors [...] [...] [...] Stephen Fry [...] [...] [...] slips {{right under the}} skin of the title character [...] presents a multidimensional portrait of a complex man [...] [...] [...] However, Wilde, like Wilde, is flawed. Gilbert's direction is sturdy but uninspired, and Ehle's part is underwritten. To her credit, Ehle movingly conveys the sad frustration that Wilde implanted in his lonely wife; but Ehle has to do the work, playing her feelings on <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>with</b> little help from Julian Mitchell's screenplay." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the events}} leading up to the {{marriage}} of Isaac and Rebecca have been institutionalized in the traditional Jewish wedding ceremony. Before the bride and bridegroom stand under the chuppah, they participate in a special ceremony called badeken (veiling). The bridegroom is led to the bride by two escorts and, seeing her, covers <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a veil, similar to the way Rebecca covered her face before marrying Isaac. Then the bridegroom (or the father of the bride, or the officiating rabbi) recites the same blessing over the bride that Rebecca's family recited over her, [...] "Our sister, may you come to be thousands of myriads, and may your offspring inherit the gate of its foes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1997, Graner's {{wife and}} mother of their two {{children}} filed for divorce and sought a protection order, saying Graner had threatened to kill her. A six-month order was granted, unopposed by Graner. Shortly after the first one expired, Staci Dean was granted a second protection order, saying Graner {{had come to her}} house, thrown her against some furniture, thrown her on the bed, grabbed her arm and hit <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> her arm. Three years later, Dean called police after Graner came to her house and attacked her. Dean said Graner had [...] "yanked me out of bed by my hair, dragging me and all the covers into the hall and tried to throw me down the steps." [...] Afterwards, Graner called a friend of Dean's and allegedly said, [...] "I have nothing if she's not my wife, she's dead." [...] Graner admitted the attack and a third order of protection was granted.|$|E
