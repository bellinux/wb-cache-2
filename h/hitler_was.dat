5|$|At Christmas in 1913, when he {{was living}} in Munich, <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> said to have placed an {{anonymous}} personal ad in the Linz newspaper with his best wishes to her, but she was already married and in Vienna by then.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> satisfied. The {{reasoning}} of the Luftwaffe seemed sound. Should {{the bombing}} achieve its aim, it offered considerable strategic value. The strike against London meant {{that most of}} the fighting on 15 September would take place between Luftflotte 2 under Albert Kesselring and Keith Park’s No. 11 Group RAF.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Soviet {{journalist}} Lev Bezymensky's book on {{the death}} of <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> published in the West. It included the SMERSH autopsy report, but because of the earlier disinformation attempts, western historians thought it untrustworthy.|$|E

25|$|<b>Hitler</b> <b>is</b> {{also the}} main 'protagonist' in the German dark satire novel Er ist wieder da ("Look Who's Back") by Timur Vermes, {{published}} in 2012. <b>Hitler</b> <b>is</b> shown to somehow reawaken, alive again, in Berlin of 2011 and, {{since no one}} believes him to really <b>be</b> <b>Hitler,</b> becomes popular on YouTube as a Hitler impersonator.|$|R
5|$|Speer {{wrote that}} Hitler had a {{negative}} view of Himmler's and Alfred Rosenberg's mystical notions and Himmler's attempt to mythologise the SS. <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> more pragmatic, and his ambitions centred on more practical concerns.|$|E
5|$|After {{midnight on}} 29 April, Hitler married Eva Braun {{in a small}} civil {{ceremony}} in the Führerbunker. After a wedding breakfast with his new wife, Hitler dictated his will to his secretary Traudl Junge. The event was witnessed and documents signed by Krebs, Burgdorf, Goebbels, and Bormann. Later that afternoon, <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> informed of the execution of Mussolini, which presumably increased his determination to avoid capture.|$|E
5|$|Berger {{had been}} remarkably successful, despite the {{obstacles}} placed {{in his path}} by the Wehrmacht, having recruited nearly 60,000 men for the Waffen-SS between mid-January {{and the end of}} June. These fresh troops were more than sufficient to replace those released when Himmler demobilised several categories of SS reservists in late July. But Himmler knew that the future of the Waffen-SS was assured; <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> already considering invading the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the failure}} to gain even local air superiority in the Battle of Britain, Operation Sea Lion was {{postponed}} indefinitely. Hitler and his generals {{were aware of the}} problems of an invasion. <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> not ideologically committed to a long war with Britain and many commentators suggest that German invasion plans were a feint never to be put into action.|$|E
5|$|For {{his part}} in the campaign, Kesselring was awarded the Knight's Cross with oak leaves, swords and {{diamonds}} by Hitler at the Wolfsschanze near Rastenburg, East Prussia on 19 July 1944. The next day, <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> {{the target of the}} 20 July plot. Informed of this event that evening by Göring, Kesselring, like many other senior commanders, sent a telegram to Hitler reaffirming his loyalty.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Rauschning {{claimed to}} have seen in Hitler's First World War {{military}} record an item concerning a court martial that found Hitler guilty of pederastic practices with an officer. Rauschning also claimed that in Munich <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> found guilty of a violation of Paragraph 175, which dealt with pederasty. No evidence of either of these two charges has been found.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{lived with}} his half-niece, Geli Raubal, in an {{apartment}} at Prinzregentenplatz 16 in Munich from 1929 until her death. On 18 September 1931 Raubal {{was found dead in}} the apartment with a gunshot wound, an apparent suicide with Hitler's pistol. <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> in Nuremberg at the time. The relationship—likely the most intense of his life—had been important to him. Hitler began seeing more of Braun after Raubal's suicide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> {{concerned}} that a military attack against Poland {{could result in}} a premature war with Britain. Hitler's foreign minister and former Ambassador to London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, assured him that neither Britain nor France would honour their commitments to Poland. Accordingly, on 22 August 1939 Hitler ordered a military mobilisation against Poland.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on parole on 20 December 1924 and Hess ten days later. The {{ban on the}} NSDAP and SA was lifted in February 1925, and the party grew to 100,000 members in 1928 and 150,000 in 1929. They received only 2.6 per cent {{of the vote in}} the 1928 election, but support increased steadily up until the seizure of power in 1933.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> {{very fond}} of Magda Goebbels and the children. He enjoyed staying at the Goebbels' Berlin apartment, where he could relax. Magda had a close {{relationship}} with Hitler, and became a member of his small coterie of female friends. She also became an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September 1929, Bormann married 19-year-old Gerda Buch, whose father, Major Walter Buch, {{served as}} a {{chairman}} of the Untersuchung und Schlichtungs-Ausschuss (USCHLA; Investigation and Settlement Committee), which was responsible for settling disputes within the party. <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> a frequent visitor to the Buch house, and {{it was here that}} Bormann met him. Hess and Hitler served as witnesses at the wedding. Bormann also had a series of mistresses, including Manja Behrens, an actress.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> {{eligible}} for parole, the Bavarian government attempted {{to have him}} deported back to Austria. The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void. In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "Hitler" [...] {{is widely}} used for anyone is overly authoritarian in manner, {{but it does not}} have the same {{negative}} connotation as in the West. For example in the 1998 film Hitler, the disciplinarian hero nicknamed <b>Hitler</b> <b>is</b> simply a person with staunch traditional values. There are at least three other Indian films entitled [...] "Hitler", in all of which the <b>Hitler</b> character <b>is</b> the hero (<b>Hitler</b> (1996 film); Hitler (1997 film); Hitler Umanath). Hitler Didi (My Sister <b>Hitler)</b> <b>is</b> a TV show about a character with a domineering elder sister.|$|R
2500|$|However the Labour conference {{voted to}} drop its {{opposition}} to rearmament. When Winston Churchill said that the Labour Party should refrain from giving Hitler the impression that Britain was divided, Bevan rejected this as [...] "sinister": [...] "The fear of <b>Hitler</b> <b>is</b> {{to be used to}} frighten the workers of Britain into silence. In short <b>Hitler</b> <b>is</b> to rule Britain by proxy. If we accept the contention that the common enemy <b>is</b> <b>Hitler</b> and not the British capitalist class, then certainly Churchill is right. But it means abandonment of the class struggle and the subservience of the British workers to their own employers".|$|R
5|$|The first inkling to {{the outside}} world that <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> dead came from the Germans themselves. On 1 May the radio station Reichssender Hamburg {{interrupted}} their normal program to announce that an important broadcast would soon be made. After dramatic funeral music by Wagner and Bruckner, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz (appointed as Hitler's successor in his will) announced that <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> dead. Dönitz called upon the German people to mourn their Führer, who died a hero defending the capital of the Reich. Hoping to save the army and the nation by negotiating a partial surrender to the British and Americans, Dönitz authorized a fighting withdrawal to the west. His tactic was somewhat successful: it enabled about 1.8 million German soldiers to avoid capture by the Soviets, but it came at a high cost in bloodshed, as troops continued to fight until 8 May.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} from prison on 20 December 1924, Berchtold was District Director of the Nazi Party in Carinthia, Austria and was leader of the SA there. After the re-formation of the Nazi Party on 20 February 1925, he again joined the party, documented as member #964. In March 1926, Berchtold returned to Munich from Austria. He became chief of the SA in Munich.|$|E
5|$|Adolf <b>Hitler</b> <b>was</b> {{furious that}} the British {{had been able}} to sail a {{flotilla}} of ships up the Loire unhindered. His immediate reaction was to dismiss Generaloberst Carl Hilpert, chief-of-staff to the Commander in Chief West. The raid refocused German attention on the Atlantic Wall, and special attention was given to ports to prevent any repeat of the raid. By June 1942, the Germans began using concrete to fortify gun emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in U-boat pens. Hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with Armaments Minister Albert Speer in August 1942, calling for the construction of 15,000 bunkers by May 1943 to defend the Atlantic coast from Norway to Spain.|$|E
5000|$|Hitler {{appears in}} the three-parter episode of Justice League {{entitled}} [...] "The Savage Time," [...] where he is overthrown and cryogenically frozen by Vandal Savage, Savage having learned how {{to win the war}} from his future self. After Savage is defeated by the Justice League, <b>Hitler</b> <b>is</b> thawed and reinstated as Germany's dictator. In the animated series Code Monkeys, <b>Hitler</b> <b>is</b> also cryogenically frozen (in carbonite, in reference to Han Solo) and is kept secret by the Hitler Family, and the Gamevision crew is invited there because of the game that Dave makes. Dave and Black Steve accidentally unfreeze Hitler, and they torture him by urinating on him. <b>Hitler</b> <b>is</b> then killed.|$|R
