5|$|Dentin is the {{substance}} between enamel or cementum and the pulp chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the <b>dental</b> <b>pulp.</b> The formation of dentin {{is known as}} dentinogenesis. The porous, yellow-hued material {{is made up of}} 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight. Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.|$|E
5|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and <b>dental</b> <b>pulp.</b> It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.|$|E

40|$|Teneurins are transmembrane {{proteins}} {{consisting of}} four paralogues (Ten- 1 - 4), notably {{expressed in the}} central nervous system during development. All teneurins contain a bioactive peptide in their carboxyl terminal named teneurin C-terminal associated peptide (TCAP). The present study analyzed the detailed distribution of teneurin- 2 -like immunoreactive (Ten- 2 -LI) cells in developing and mature rat molar teeth, as well as in mature human <b>dental</b> <b>pulps.</b> Ten- 2 and TCAP- 2 genic expressions were also evaluated in rat and human <b>dental</b> <b>pulps.</b> Finally, Ten- 2 -LI cells were analyzed during the repair process after dentin-pulp complex injury in rat lower molar teeth. For this, histological sections of rat molar teeth and human <b>dental</b> <b>pulps</b> were submitted to immunohistochemical techniques, while total RNA from developing rat teeth and mature human <b>dental</b> <b>pulps</b> were submitted to conventional RT-PCR. Ten- 2 -LI cells were evident in the initial bell stage of rat molar teeth development, especially in ectomesenchymal cells of the dental papilla. Ten- 2 -LI odontoblasts showed strong immunoreactivity in rat and human mature teeth. Ten- 2 and TCAP- 2 genic expressions were confirmed in rat and human <b>dental</b> <b>pulps.</b> Dentin-pulp complex injury resulted in a decrease of Ten- 2 -LI odontoblasts after traumatic injury. Interestingly, Ten- 2 -LI cells were also evident in the pulp cell-rich zone in all postoperative days. In conclusion, Ten- 2 -LI presence in rat and human odontoblasts was demonstrated {{for the first time and}} Ten- 2 /TCAP- 2 genic expressions were confirmed in rat and human <b>dental</b> <b>pulps.</b> Furthermore, it was revealed that Ten- 2 -LI rat odontoblasts can be modulated during the regenerative process...|$|R

25|$|The cornea {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{sensitive}} tissues of the body, as it is densely innervated with sensory nerve fibres via the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve by way of 70–80 long ciliary nerves. Research suggests the density of pain receptors in the cornea is 300-600 times greater than skin and 20-40 times greater than <b>dental</b> <b>pulp,</b> making any injury to the structure excruciatingly painful.|$|E
25|$|Coronectomy is a {{procedure}} used when the surgeon {{believes that there}} is a high risk of inferior alveolar nerve injury. After making the incision in the mucosa and removing bone adjacent the tooth, the crown is cut and removed with no attempt at removing the roots.

25|$|Tooth enamel {{is one of}} {{the four}} major tissues that make up the tooth in humans and many other animals, {{including}} some species of fish. It makes up the normally visible part of the tooth, covering the crown.

50|$|Dentinogenesis is the {{formation}} of dentin, a substance that forms the majority of teeth. Dentinogenesis is performed by odontoblasts, which are a special type of biological cell on the outer wall of <b>dental</b> <b>pulps,</b> and it begins at the late bell stage of a tooth development. The different stages of dentin formation after differentiation of the cell result in different types of dentin: mantle dentin, primary dentin, secondary dentin, and tertiary dentin.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The need to {{identify}} bodies that are found {{as a result of}} disappearances with a diversity of causes, illegal burials and massive disasters, represent a wide percentage of dentistry practice on forensic research. The following study determined the perfor-mance of Barr Body Test, in fibroblasts of healthy teeth, under different conditions of burial (in vitro) with variations in pH, humidity and salinity in terms of general accuracy and sensitivity for men and women. Analyzed sample considered 47 <b>dental</b> <b>pulps,</b> taken from teeth under burial conditions during a period of a month. From <b>dental</b> <b>pulps</b> samples, 265 histological cuts valid for this study, were obtained, which were observed with an optical microscope under conventional H/E staining. Results showed a 98. 9 % of well-diagnosed cases, which correspond to the overall accuracy of the method. Sensitivity for men was 97. 5 % and 100 % for women, over the analyzed sample. In low humidity conditions, 3 samples of badly diagnosed cases in men were observed, with a group accuracy of a 90 %, with a sensitivity of 25 % for men and 100 % for women. The present study establishes that based on these results, the performance of Barr Body Test in fibroblasts, proposed for healthy pulp teeth, is not affected by burial conditions in terms of pH (acid-alkaline), salinity (high-low) and high humidity...|$|R
25|$|Once a lesion has cavitated, {{especially}} if dentin is involved, remineralization {{is much more}} difficult and a dental restoration is usually indicated ("operative treatment"). Before a restoration can be placed, all of the decay must be removed otherwise it will continue to progress underneath the filling. Sometimes a small amount of decay can be left if it is entombed and there is a seal which isolates the bacteria from their substrate. This can be likened to placing a glass container over a candle, which burns itself out once the oxygen is used up. Techniques such as stepwise caries removal are designed to avoid exposure of the <b>dental</b> <b>pulp</b> and overall reduction of the amount of tooth substance which requires removal before the final filling is placed. Often enamel which overlies decayed dentin must also be removed as it is unsupported and susceptible to fracture. The modern decision-making process with regards the activity of the lesion, and whether it is cavitated, is summarized in the table.|$|E
25|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) are of stromal origin and may {{differentiate}} into {{a variety of}} tissues. MSCs have been isolated from placenta, adipose tissue, lung, bone marrow and blood, Wharton's jelly from the umbilical cord, and teeth (perivascular niche of <b>dental</b> <b>pulp</b> and periodontal ligament). MSCs are attractive for clinical therapy due to their ability to differentiate, provide trophic support, and modulate innate immune response. These cells have the ability to differentiate into various cell types such as osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipocytes, neuroectodermal cells, and hepatocytes. Bioactive mediators that favor local cell growth are also secreted by MSCs. Anti-inflammatory effects on the local microenvironment, which promote tissue healing, are also observed. The inflammatory response can be modulated by adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRC) including mesenchymal stem cells and regulatory T-lymphocytes. The mesenchymal stem cells thus alter the outcome of the immune response by changing the cytokine secretion of dendritic and T-cell subsets. This results in a shift from a pro-inflammatory environment to an anti-inflammatory or tolerant cell environment.|$|E
25|$|The first {{reported}} cases of knocked-out teeth being replanted was by Pare’ in 1593. In 1706, Pierre Fauchard also reported replanting knocked out teeth. Wigoper in 1933 used a cast gold splint to hold reimplanted teeth in place. In 1959, Lenstrup and Skieller declared that the success rate of replanted knocked out teeth {{should be considered a}} temporary procedure because the success rate of less than 10% was so poor. In 1966 in a retrospective study, Andresen theorized that 90% of avulsed teeth could be successfully retained if they were replanted within the first 30 minutes of the accident. In 1974, Cvek showed that removal of the <b>dental</b> <b>pulp</b> following reimplantation was necessary to prevent resorption of the tooth root. In 1974, Cvek showed that storage of knocked out teeth in saline could improve the success of replanted teeth. In 1977, Lindskog et al. showed that the key to retention of the knocked-out teeth was to maintain the vitality of the periodontal ligament. In 1980, Blomlof showed the storing the periodontal ligament cells in a biocompatible medium could extend the extra oral time to four hours or more. He found that the best storage medium was a medical research fluid called Hank’s Balanced Solution. In this study, it was serendipitously discovered that milk could also maintain cell viability for two hours. In 1981, Andreasen showed that crushing of cells on the tooth root could cause death of the cells and lead to resorption and reduction in prognosis. In 1983, Matsson et al. showed that soaking in Hank’s Balanced Solution for thirty minutes prior to reimplantation could revitalize extracted dog’s teeth that were dry for 60 minutes. In 1989, a systematic storage device was developed to optimally store and preserve knocked out teeth. In 1992, Trope et al. showed that extracted dog’s teeth could be stored in Hank’s Balanced Solution for up to 96 hours and still maintain significant vitality. In this study, milk was only able to maintain vitality for two hours.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of immune factors in inflamed <b>dental</b> <b>pulps,</b> suggests that immune responses could participate in disease process. With {{regard to the}} {{presence of}} significant number of mast cells in pulpitis cases, {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine the correlation between concentration and presence of IgE in supernatant fluids of explants cultures of different states of <b>dental</b> <b>pulps.</b> For this purpose, a total of forty-eight pulpal samples were evaluated. They were 10, 10, 8, 11, and 9 pulpal samples from impacted teeth, normal erupted teeth, teeth with carious lesions, irreversible symptomatic pulpitis and irreversible asymptomatic pulpitis, respectively. The samples were maintained in explants cultures for 72 hours. Sandwich ELISA was used to detect and quantitate IgE in supernatant fluids. It was shown that in impacted and carious samples, there were not any IgE. The presence of IgE in normal, symptomatic and asymptomatic samples were 30 %, 45. 5 % and 55. 6 %, with average concentration of 0. 063 + 0. 02, 0. 24 ± 0. 148 and 0. 235 + 20. 17 IU/ml, respectively. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between different states of pulps with regard to presence of IgE (P= 0. 0324). With regard to concentration of IgE, there were significant differences between impacted and symptomatic (P= 0. 0325); and carious and symptomatic (P= 0. 0397). It is concluded that with increase in antigenic stimuli, there is a proper condition for production of IgE, as the highest presence of IgE was related to irreversible asymptomatic pulpitis. Bacterial by-products are possible allergens, which can induce the production of IgE...|$|R

Isolates were characterized from partial sequences of the 16 S rRNA gene and identified by comparison with taxa in the Human Oral Microbiome Database ([URL] The microbiotas of carious lesions and <b>dental</b> <b>pulps</b> were compared using univariate and multivariate approaches. Results: The microbiota of cariously exposed pulps was similar in composition to that of carious lesion biofilms except that fewer species/taxa were identified from pulps. The major taxa identified belonged to the phyla Firmicutes (mainly streptococci) and Actinobacteria (mainly Actinomyces species). Actinomyces and Selenomonas species were associated with carious lesions whereas Veillonella species, particularly Veillonella dispar was associated with pulps. Other bacteria detected in pulps included Streptococcus mutans, Parascardovia denticolens, Bifidobacterium longum, and several Lactobacillus and Actinomyces species. By principal, component analysis pulp microbiotas grouped together, whereas those in caries biofilms were widely dispersed. Conclusions: We conclude that the microbiota of cariously exposed vital primary pulps is composed of a subset of species associated with carious lesions. Vital primary pulps had a dominant Firmicutes and Actinobacteria microbiota which contrasts with reports of endodontic infections which can harbor a gram-negative microbiota. The microbiota of exposed primary pulps may provide insight into bacterial species {{at the forefront of}} caries invasion in dentinal lesions that can invade into the pulp and the nature of species that need suppressing for successful pulp therapy...|$|R
