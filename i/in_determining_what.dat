The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E
5|$|Rhyme {{consists}} of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds {{placed at the}} ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("internal rhyme"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme. The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> poetic forms are commonly used in that language.|$|E
5|$|The {{integers}} {{have additional}} properties {{which do not}} generalize to all commutative rings. An important example is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into prime numbers. Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings, but Noether found a unique factorization theorem, now called the Lasker–Noether theorem, for the ideals of many rings. Much of Noether's work lay <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> properties do hold for all rings, in devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems, and in determining the minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings.|$|E

25|$|This {{case was}} the first time the Supreme Court dealt with Exemption 7(D) of the Freedom of Information Act and the United States government's use of it.

The case was also important <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> constitutes “Use in Commerce” under the Lanham Act in cyberspace.

25|$|Although extensive, these {{programs}} were often undertaken {{without reference to}} the local population and it was not until 1969 that villagers were involved <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> projects would be undertaken and in their construction. Equally, ongoing staff and material support was usually not provided, while maintenance and sustainment was the responsibility of the provincial government which often lacked the capacity or the will to provide it, limiting the benefit provided to the local population. The program continued until 1 ATF's withdrawal in 1971, and although it may have succeeded in generating goodwill towards Australian forces, it largely failed to increase support for the South Vietnamese government in the province. Equally, while the program made some useful contributions to the civil facilities and infrastructure in Phuoc Tuy which remained following the Australian departure, it had little impact on the course of the conflict.|$|E

25|$|Sugarbeet root aphid stem mothers induce gall {{formation}} in the leaf by probing the leaf tissue with their stylets. This leads {{to the formation of}} a small depression on the leaf, which eventually closes up over the stem mother and forms a gall. The extent of the probing activity dictates gall size, and removing the stem mother early on in the process leads to the formation of an unclosed, rudimentary gall. The extent of probing activity is correlated with the aphid's reproductive success. The probing activity may also serve a secondary purpose in helping the aphid determine leaf size. Leaf size is an important factor <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> leaf a stem mother chooses to develop a gall on, but at the time of leaf colonization, leaves that are being colonized are only a tenth to a quarter of their mature size. It has been suggested that, during the probing of the leaf, the stem mother gauges the chemical environment of the leaf and uses that as a predictor of final leaf size and suitability as a gall site. Aphids possess chemosensory organs, allowing them to respond to a variety of stimuli from the plant, both those of the volatile variety (olfaction) and non-volatile variety (taste). Once the aphid is on a plant, it tests the surface of plant with its antennae and probes the plant with its mouth parts. The antennae contain many sensilla, allowing them to sense tactile and chemical stimuli.|$|E

500|$|In 1980, {{poet and}} essayist Adrienne Rich {{expanded}} upon the political meaning of lesbian by proposing {{a continuum of}} lesbian existence based on [...] "woman-identified experience". All relationships between women, Rich proposed, have some lesbian element, regardless if they claim a lesbian identity: mothers and daughters, women who work together, and women who nurse each other, for example. Such a perception of women relating to each other connects them through time and across cultures, and Rich considered heterosexuality a condition forced upon women by men. Several years earlier, DOB founders Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon similarly relegated sexual acts as unnecessary <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> a lesbian is, by providing their definition: [...] "a woman whose primary erotic, psychological, emotional and social interest is in a member of her own sex, even though that interest may not be overtly expressed".|$|E

Saints Row: The Third was finally announced officially in March 2011. The team wanted to include many different features and items, so scoping the final product became an issue. They laid out their ideas on a schedule and began to cut until over [...] "4000 man-days of scheduled work" [...] were removed, including features such as free-running (called [...] "freegunning") and a cover system. Competitive multiplayer was removed due to its lack of popularity in the previous series entries. In retrospect, Phillips said he wanted to remove more. The studio borrowed people {{from other parts of the}} company to finish the project. Writer Drew Holmes expressed the difficulty <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> was too risqué for the game.

500|$|While Susie's {{addition}} helps The Fabulous Baker Boys experience success, it also {{results in}} complications {{among the group}} by disturbing some of the original act's traditions and threatening to come between the two brothers when Jack begins {{to fall in love}} with her. Susie and Jack's growing mutual attraction towards each other eventually threatens the stability of the trio. Having a family of his own, Frank is particularly concerned that if his younger brother Jack pursues Susie he will ultimately disregard her and cause her to leave the group, while Susie insists that she deserves a say <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> songs the trio will perform, particularly lamenting that she is forced to sing [...] "Feelings" [...] at every scheduled performance. When Frank is pulled away from work for a family emergency around New Year's Eve, Susie and Jack seize the opportunity to make adjustments to their set list and ultimately make love in a late night jazz club after performing alone together. Frank is furious to learn that Susie and Jack have changed the set list without his permission and an argument ensues between Jack and Frank. Susie eventually leaves both the group and Jack due to Jack's refusal to express his true feelings for her, accepting a job singing jingles for television commercials. After mending his relationship with Frank, Susie receives a visit from Jack who apologizes for his behavior towards her; Susie does not clarify if she and Jack will rekindle their romance before walking away.|$|E
