2500|$|Methods {{for cutting}} a block can vary {{depending}} on the formation and other factors, but usually involve three types of saws (wire and two chain types of which all three are diamond edged). [...] The usual approach starts with a horizontal cut at the bottom after which metal rollers are inserted (on which to move the block away from the mountain after all sides have been cut). [...] Next is the back cut with a wire saw followed by chain saws to cut the vertical sides. [...] A metal bag is then inserted behind the back cut and filled with water, which pushes the block away from the rock face (on the metal rollers). [...] The block is then rigged for lifting by forklift and placed on a <b>haul</b> <b>truck</b> and driven out of the mountain and down to the staging area {{on the grounds of the}} old mill site.
