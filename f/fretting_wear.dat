2500|$|Typically, a bolt is {{tensioned}} (preloaded) by {{the application}} of a torque to either the bolt head or the nut. The applied torque causes the bolt to [...] "climb" [...] the thread causing a tensioning of the bolt and an equivalent compression in the components being fastened by the bolt. The preload developed in a bolt is due to the applied torque and {{is a function of the}} bolt diameter, the geometry of the threads, and the coefficients of friction that exist in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut. The stiffness of the components clamped by the bolt has no relation to the preload that is developed by the torque. The relative stiffness of the bolt and the clamped joint components do, however, determine the fraction of the external tension load that the bolt will carry and that in turn determines preload needed to prevent joint separation and by that means to reduce the range of stress the bolt experiences as the tension load is repeatedly applied. This determines the durability of the bolt when subjected to repeated tension loads. Maintaining a sufficient joint preload also prevents relative slippage of the joint components that would produce <b>fretting</b> <b>wear</b> that could result in a fatigue failure of those parts.|$|E

The Rickenbacker 4003, which {{replaced}} the 4001, differs in the truss rod design and introduces a fret wire that better withstands the wear from round-wound strings. Fast <b>fret</b> <b>wear</b> was a common complaint for many years, and Rickenbacker sought to address the issue. Other features remained similar to its forebearer.|$|R
5000|$|Regular <b>fret</b> <b>wear</b> {{causes a}} flat {{spot on the}} {{previously}} round top of the fret. This can result in buzzing, poor [...] intonation, and difficult playing. Unless the damage is severe or the fret has become too short, the issue can often be resolved without replacing the frets.

50|$|This {{subdivision}} of {{the contact}} area into stick (adhesion) and slip areas manifests itself a.o. in <b>fretting</b> <b>wear.</b> Note that wear occurs only where power is dissipated, which requires stress and local relative displacement (slip) {{between the two}} surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|Fat frets: {{on older}} guitars (especially the Fender Stratocaster), frets were {{typically}} {{made out of}} thin wire, and some electric guitar players replaced that with thicker wire, for [...] "fat frets" [...] or [...] "jumbo frets". Fat frets make bending easier, and they change {{the feel of the}} guitar. As well, large frets, offering more metal, remain playable much longer than thin frets. A side effect of a thicker fret is a less precise note, since the string is held over a wider surface, causing a slight inaccuracy of pitch, which increases in significane as <b>frets</b> <b>wear.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some musicians boil guitar or bass strings to {{rejuvenate}} them. The {{high temperature}} of the boiling water helps free the strings of oil, salt, and grime from the players hands. When a string is played, very small metal shavings from <b>fret</b> <b>wear</b> may break off and lodge between the windings of the strings. Heating the strings can expand these particles and separate them from the windings. Some players use deionized water to boil strings, believing that mineral deposits in tap water may aid corrosion of the string core. After boiling, strings may have less elasticity and be more brittle, depending {{on the quality of}} the alloys involved. Putting the strings through a cycle in the dishwasher has also been known to work.|$|R

50|$|Bolts in a {{bolted joint}} often have an {{important}} function as a dowel, resisting shear forces. For this reason, many bolts have a plain unthreaded section to their shank. This gives a closer fit to the hole and also avoids some problems with <b>fretting</b> <b>wear</b> when a screw thread bears against an unthreaded component.|$|E
50|$|Soft {{materials}} often exhibit higher {{susceptibility to}} fretting than hard materials {{of a similar}} type. The hardness ratio of the two sliding materials also {{has an effect on}} <b>fretting</b> <b>wear.</b> However, softer materials such as polymers can show the opposite effect when they capture hard debris which becomes embedded in their bearing surfaces. They then act as a very effective abrasive agent, wearing down the harder metal with which they are in contact.|$|E
5000|$|The bridge {{failure was}} due to a defect in a single link, eye-bar 330, on {{the north of the}} Ohio {{subsidiary}} chain, the first link below the top of the Ohio tower. A small crack was formed through <b>fretting</b> <b>wear</b> at the bearing, and grew through internal corrosion, a problem known as stress corrosion cracking. The crack was only about 0.1 in deep when it went critical, and it broke in a brittle fashion. Growth of the crack was probably exacerbated by residual stress in the eyebar created during manufacture. [...] The bridge, and the people on it when it collapsed, were victims of insufficient redundancy.|$|E

50|$|A similar-looking kind {{of damage}} is called false {{brinelling}} and {{is caused by}} <b>fretting</b> <b>wear.</b> This occurs when contacting bodies vibrate {{against each other in}} the presence of very small loads, which pushes lubricant out of the contact surface area, and the bearing assembly cannot move far enough to redistribute the displaced lubricant. The result is a finely polished surface that resembles a brinell mark, but has not permanently deformed either contacting surface. This type of false brinelling usually occurs in bearings during transportation, between the time of manufacture and installation. The polished surfaces are often mistaken for brinelling, although no actual damage to the bearing exists. The false brinelling will disappear after a short break-in period of operation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fretting</b> <b>wear</b> {{can also}} occur during operation, causing deeper indentations. This occurs when small {{vibrations}} {{form in the}} rotating shaft and become harmonically {{in sync with the}} speed of rotation, causing circular oscillations in the shaft. The oscillation causes the shaft to move in precession, and the timing of the rotation speed causes the balls or rollers to contact the races only when they are in similar positions. This forms wear marks caused by contact with the bearings and the races in specific areas, but not in others, leaving an uneven wear-pattern that resembles brinelling. However, the marks are usually too wide and do not exactly match the shape of the bearing, and therefore this type of wear can be differentiated from true brinelling.|$|E
5000|$|Bolts {{are often}} {{used to make a}} bolted joint. This is a {{combination}} of the nut applying an axial clamping force and also the shank of the bolt acting as a dowel, pinning the joint against sideways shear forces. For this reason, many bolts have a plain unthreaded shank (called the [...] ) as this makes for a better, stronger dowel. The presence of the unthreaded shank has often been given as characteristic of bolts vs. screws, [...] but this is incidental to its use, rather than defining. The grip length should be chosen carefully, to be around the same length as the thickness of the materials, and any washers, bolted together. Too short places the dowel shear load onto the threads, which may cause <b>fretting</b> <b>wear</b> on the hole. Too long prevents the nut from being tightened down correctly. No more than two turns of the thread should be within the hole.|$|E

50|$|All metal strings are {{susceptible}} to oxidation and corrosion. Wound strings commonly use metals such as brass or bronze in their winding. These two metals are very vulnerable to corrosion. The sebaceous gland in the player's skin produces oils that can be acidic. The oils, salts, and moisture from the player's fingers are the largest source of corrosion. The composition of the oil and the oxygen in the air also helps to oxidize and corrode the strings. In steel strings the oxygen reacts with the iron in the steel and it creates the rust. As a result, the string loses its brilliance over time. Water, another by-product of oxidation, increases the potential acid corrosion in oils. Wound strings such as bronze acoustic strings, {{are very difficult to}} keep fresh sounding {{due to the lack of}} corrosion resistance. To help solve the corrosion problem strings are either metal plated or polymer coated. The polymer coating is claimed to reduce finger squeak and <b>fret</b> <b>wear,</b> and has better tuning capability. Some companies sell lubricating oils that slow down the oxidation process, increasing the string's life-span. These special lubricating oils are applied to the strings as a barrier to the air, to help slow the oxidation process.|$|R

50|$|<b>Fretting</b> <b>wear</b> is the {{repeated}} cyclical rubbing between two surfaces. Over {{a period of}} time fretting which will remove material from one or both surfaces in contact. It occurs typically in bearings, although most bearings have their surfaces hardened to resist the problem. Another problem occurs when cracks in either surface are created, known as fretting fatigue. It is the more serious of the two phenomena because it can lead to catastrophic failure of the bearing. An associated problem occurs when the small particles removed by wear are oxidised in air. The oxides are usually harder than the underlying metal, so wear accelerates as the harder particles abrade the metal surfaces further. Fretting corrosion acts in the same way, especially when water is present. Unprotected bearings on large structures like bridges can suffer serious degradation in behaviour, especially when salt is used the during winter to deice the highways carried by the bridges. The problem of fretting corrosion was involved in the Silver Bridge tragedy and the Mianus River Bridge accident.|$|E

5000|$|... 5R4E PPE has {{a surface}} tension of 49.9 dynes/cm, which is amongst {{the highest in}} pure organic liquids. Because of this, this PPE and the other PPEs do not {{effectively}} wet metal surfaces. This property is useful when migration of a lubricant {{from one part of}} the equipment to another part must be avoided, such as in certain electronic devices. A thin film of polyphenyl ether on a surface is not a thin contiguous film as one would envision, but rather comprises tiny droplets. This PPE property tends to keep the film stationary, or at least to cause it to remain in the area where the lubrication is needed, rather than migrating away by spreading and forming a new surface. As a result, contamination of other components and equipment, which do not require a lubricant, is avoided. The high surface tension of PPEs, therefore, makes them useful in lubricating electronic contacts. [...] Polyphenyl ether lubricants have a 30-year history of commercial service for connectors with precious and base metal contacts in telecom, automotive, aerospace, instrumentation and general-purpose applications. [...] In addition to maintaining the current flow and providing long-term lubrication, PPEs offer protection to connectors against aggressive acidic and oxidative environments. By providing a protective surface film, polyphenyl ethers not only protect connectors against corrosion but also against vibration-related wear and abrasion that leads to <b>fretting</b> <b>wear.</b> The devices that benefit from the specialized properties of PPEs include cell phones, printers, {{and a variety of other}} electronic appliances. The protection lasts for decades or for the life of the equipment.|$|E

40|$|Fretting is a {{phenomenon}} occurring when two contacting surfaces experience small amplitude oscillatory relative motion. Fretting is of major concern as it is present in almost all machinery. Fretting may lead to complete failure of otherwise robust components. Fretting cases {{can be divided into}} two categories: <b>fretting</b> <b>wear,</b> in which damage is governed by particle detachment and fretting fatigue, in which crack propagation is the cause of failure. The {{purpose of this study is}} to experimentally investigate <b>fretting</b> <b>wear</b> phenomenon for various contacting surface pairs. A <b>Fretting</b> <b>Wear</b> Test Rig (FWTR) was designed and developed in order to conduct tests on specimens of different geometries. The <b>fretting</b> <b>wear</b> behavior of uncoated and coated specimens was studied. Images of wear scars and measurements of wear volume were used to determine the effect of motion parameters, normal pressure, amplitude of oscillation and number of cycles on <b>fretting</b> <b>wear.</b> The coatings were found to mitigate <b>fretting</b> <b>wear</b> significantly while the effect of normal pressure was more complex. A detailed factorial analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of normal pressure and amplitude on <b>fretting</b> <b>wear.</b> The results indicated that <b>fretting</b> <b>wear</b> loss varies as a combination of normal pressure and slip amplitude. It was found that <b>fretting</b> <b>wear</b> increases, reaches a peak and then reduces with increasing normal pressure.

25|$|The {{work done}} by {{friction}} can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials {{such as in the}} process of friction welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (<b>fretting)</b> exacerbates <b>wear</b> of frictional forces.
