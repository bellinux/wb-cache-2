5|$|Treatment of meth mouth usually {{attempts}} to increase salivary flow, halt tooth decay, and encourage behavioral changes. Toothpaste with fluoride {{is very important}} to the restoration of <b>dental</b> <b>health.</b> Only prescription fluoride rinses can adequately treat the condition. Sialogogues, drugs that increase the amount of saliva in the mouth, can be used to treat dry mouth and protect against <b>dental</b> <b>health</b> problems. Pilocarpine and cevimeline are sialogogues approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat low salivation caused by Sjogren's syndrome and may have the potential to effectively treat dry mouth caused by methamphetamine use.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{generally}} have thin tooth enamel compared to anthropoid primates.

Little other <b>dental</b> <b>health</b> information is available for lemurs, except that wild ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve occasionally exhibit abscessed maxillary canines (seen as open wounds on the muzzle) and tooth decay, possibly due to the consumption of non-native foods.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{representation}} of academically based diplomates of the American Board of <b>Dental</b> Public <b>Health</b> (ABDPH) and to identify their perceptions on the training of <b>dental</b> public <b>health</b> predoctoral faculty. METHODS: Data were collected by a mailed, self-administered, 13 -item questionnaire. The population was the 48 diplomates of the ABDPH as of March 1997 associated with academic institutions. RESULTS: Twenty of the 55 US dental schools had a diplomate of the ABDPH with a mean of 1. 8 diplomates per school with a diplomate. An average of 4. 5 full-time faculty members per school were associated with teaching <b>dental</b> public <b>health.</b> A master 2 ̆ 7 s degree in public health (MPH) was the most frequently suggested educational requirement for <b>dental</b> public <b>health</b> faculty. Continuing education courses were training needs perceived for <b>dental</b> public <b>health</b> faculty. The lack of time, money, and incentives, along with perceived rigidity of requirements for board certification, were reported as major barriers for faculty becoming <b>dental</b> public <b>health</b> board certified. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous challenges confront the development of a strong <b>dental</b> public <b>health</b> presence in US dental schools. These challenges include, among others, insufficient numbers of academic <b>dental</b> public <b>health</b> specialists and insufficient motivations to encourage promising candidates to pursue specialty status...|$|R

5|$|Whether {{the drug}} {{has a unique}} effect on <b>dental</b> <b>health</b> has been {{questioned}} by a few academics, who note that the long-term use of several other drugs sometimes causes dental problems. Several academic reviews have contradicted this perspective, affirming meth mouth's status as a discrete condition. In favor of its unique status, these reviews cite the differences between methamphetamine-caused caries and those that occur for other reasons, such as cocaine use, {{as well as the}} scope of the tooth decay found in some long-term methamphetamine users.|$|E
5|$|Tooth decay {{is caused}} by certain types of acid-producing {{bacteria}} which cause the most damage {{in the presence of}} fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special mineral content causes it to be sensitive to low pH. Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, <b>dental</b> <b>health</b> organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{and compares}} the education in {{and practice of}} <b>dental</b> public <b>health</b> in Finland and the United Kingdom. A brief introduction describes the populations {{of the two countries}} in terms of their geography, mean per capita, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), life expectancy, recent oral epidemiological data, oral health needs and the dental workforce. This is followed by a description of education in <b>Dental</b> Public <b>Health</b> in each country at undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing levels. The practice of <b>Dental</b> Public <b>Health</b> is then outlined. In both countries it includes: leadership and management of health organisations, teaching, training, research, advising and evaluating. A discussion follows. It considers the need for the provision of <b>Dental</b> Public <b>Health</b> at a time of changing oral health need and gives examples of problems that have arisen when such advice has not been sought or has been ignored. Finally, the paper considers how education in <b>Dental</b> Public <b>Health</b> could be developed to provide more flexible training whilst ensuring that the quality of knowledge and skills o...|$|R

5|$|Methamphetamine (meth), {{a highly}} {{addictive}} drug {{that produces a}} dramatic increase in energy and euphoria, can have negative health effects that include serious dental problems. , it is the most discussed illegal drug in dental literature. The most notable effect of long-term use of methamphetamine on <b>dental</b> <b>health</b> is the development of caries (tooth decay); the teeth of some drug users appear to be dark and in the process of disintegrating. Caries often occur in the cervical regions of teeth, where the tooth surface narrows at the junction of the crown and the root. It is usually found on the buccal (cheek) side of the teeth and on tooth surfaces that are adjacent to incisors and canines; eventually, the coronal tooth area, near the crown, can be affected by the decay and erosion. The dental caries of meth mouth often progress slowly, perhaps because their advancement is hindered by intermittent hygienic practices. The decay can lead to tooth fractures and severe pain. In some cases, teeth are permanently damaged and must be removed. Along with malnutrition and weight loss, the dental effects of methamphetamine use contribute to the appearance of premature aging seen in some users. The effects of meth mouth {{are similar to those of}} Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes a lack of saliva, which results in tooth decay.|$|E

40|$|A {{panel of}} public health {{practitioners}} sponsored by the Health Resources and Services Administration met December 6 - 8, 1994, to examine current roles and responsibilities for <b>dental</b> public <b>health</b> workers and to recommend changes in education and training to meet challenges posed by an evolving health care system. Overall, at least the same number, if not more, <b>dental</b> public <b>health</b> personnel will be needed in the future. While some new roles were identified, the panel felt that only small numbers of personnel {{will be needed to}} fill these new roles. Not all of these roles necessarily require a dental degree. The panel felt that a need exists for more academicians for dental schools, schools of public <b>health,</b> <b>dental</b> public <b>health</b> residencies, and <b>dental</b> hygiene programs; oral epidemiologists and health services researchers; health educators; and specialists in utilization review/outcomes assessment, dental informatics, nutrition, program evaluation, and prevention. To meet these personnel needs: (1) <b>dental</b> public <b>health</b> residency programs should be structured to meet the educational needs of working public health dentists with MPH degrees through on-the-job residency programs; (2) the standards for advanced specialty education programs in <b>dental</b> public <b>health</b> should be made sufficiently flexible to include dentists who have advanced education and the requisite core public health courses; (3) flexible MPH degree programs must be available because of the rising debt of dental students and the decreased numbers of graduating dentists; (4) loan repayment should be available for dentists who have pursued public health training and are working in state or local health departments; and (5) standards for advanced education in <b>dental</b> public <b>health</b> should be developed for dental hygienists...|$|R
