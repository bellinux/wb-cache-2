As Juan approached on September27, warning broadcasts on local media in Atlantic Canada were changed accordingly.

5|$|Another {{group was}} called Microsauria by Cope in 1868. He {{classified}} Microsauria as a subgroup of Labyrinthodontia, placing many small, amphibian-like animals within it. Among them was Dendrerpeton, once placed in Ganocephala. Dendrerpeton was later placed as a labyrinthodont with other temnospondyls, but confusion <b>existed</b> <b>for</b> many years over {{the classification of}} small amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Churchill Machine Tools (Coventry) Ltd (company {{registration}} 00087969) was liquidated in 1974. The {{significance of}} this company is uncertain but the low registration number indicates that the entity, even if not using the particular name, had <b>existed</b> <b>for</b> some considerable time: by the 1950s new companies were being issued numbers around the 00500000 region, and by the 2000s this had become a series starting around 01400000.|$|E

5|$|Initially, forecasters {{believed}} Alex {{would remain}} weak, {{and on the}} first advisory the storm was predicted to make landfall as a minimal tropical storm.

5|$|Sculptural {{fragments}} to Rodin were autonomous works, and {{he considered}} them {{the essence of}} his artistic statement. His fragments– perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head– took sculpture further from its traditional role of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms <b>existed</b> <b>for</b> their own sake. Notable examples are The Walking Man, Meditation without Arms, and Iris, Messenger of the Gods.|$|E

Library catalogs listed the total number of lines in each work along with the title and author.|$|E
