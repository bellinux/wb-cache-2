5|$|Burrowing behaviour, {{in which}} an {{individual}} sinks itself entirely (or partially) into the substrate, is frequent among strombid gastropods. The burrowing behaviour of L.canarium consists {{of a series of}} movements characteristic of the species. There are three consecutive movements: first is probing, where the animal pushes the anterior portion of the foot into the substrate to gain a hold; next is shovelling, where <b>it</b> <b>pushes</b> the substrate with its long, extensible proboscis. Retraction is the final movement, where it moves the shell along an anterior-posterior axis to settle the substrate around it. Once burrowed, part of the dorsal shell is usually still visible (although the ventral surface and the animal's soft parts are buried).|$|E

25|$|Retail {{engravers}} mainly use {{two different}} processes. The {{first and most}} common 'Diamond Drag' pushes the diamond cutter through {{the surface of the}} material and then pulls to create scratches. These direction and depth are controlled by the computer input. The second is 'Spindle Cutter'. This is similar to Diamond Drag, but the engraving head is shaped in a flat V shape, with a small diamond and the base. The machine uses an electronic spindle to quickly rotate the head as <b>it</b> <b>pushes</b> it into the material, then pulls it along whilst it continues to spin. This creates a much bolder impression than diamond drag. It is used mainly for brass plaques and pet tags.|$|E

25|$|Storm petrels use {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to aid flight. Most species will occasionally feed by surface pattering, holding and moving their feet on the water's surface while holding steady above the water. They remain stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the wind to anchor themselves in place. This method of feeding flight is most commonly used by austral storm petrels. The white-faced storm petrel possesses a unique variation on pattering, holding its wings motionless and at an angle into the wind <b>it</b> <b>pushes</b> itself off the water's surface in a succession of bounding jumps. Storm petrels also use dynamic soaring and slope soaring to travel over the ocean surface, although this method is used less by this family compared to the northern storm petrels. Slope soaring is more straightforward and favoured by the Oceanitidae, the storm petrel turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} the {{combustion}} of propellant in the rocket engine {{is to increase the}} velocity of the resulting gases to very high speeds, hence producing a thrust. Initially, the gases of combustion are sent in every direction, but only those that produce a net thrust have any effect. The ideal direction of motion of the exhaust is in the direction so as to cause thrust. At the top end of the combustion chamber the hot, energetic gas fluid cannot move forward, and so, <b>it</b> <b>pushes</b> upward against the top of the rocket engine's combustion chamber. As the combustion gases approach the exit of the combustion chamber, they increase in speed. The {{effect of the}} convergent part of the rocket engine nozzle on the high pressure fluid of combustion gases, is to cause the gases to accelerate to high speed. The higher the speed of the gases, the lower the pressure of the gas (Bernoulli's principle or conservation of energy) acting on that part of the combustion chamber. In a properly designed engine, the flow will reach Mach 1 at the throat of the nozzle. At which point the speed of the flow increases. Beyond the throat of the nozzle, a bell shaped expansion part of the engine allows the gases that are expanding to push against that part of the rocket engine. Thus, the bell part of the nozzle gives additional thrust. Simply expressed, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, according to Newton's third law with the result that the exiting gases produce the reaction of a force on the rocket causing it to accelerate the rocket.|$|E

He later commented, [...] "I put 'desperate' [...] to try to indicate, however subtly... I'm going to have some fun with the imagery, to take it to some interesting places. Most critics got the joke.

[...] The project was officially announced on October 23, 2003 as a cross between American Beauty and Knots Landing.

Kyra shares her premonition of the Avatars with Phoebe.

After witnessing the vision, Phoebe has a premonition of the demon Zankou (Oded Fehr) vanquishing Kyra. In order to prevent Kyra's death, Phoebe convinces the Elders to provide a spell to turn Kyra human. During this time, Kyra forces Leo to reveal his true identity as an Avatar to the sisters. While Piper Halliwell (Holly Marie Combs) helps her to prepare for her new life as a mortal, Kyra reveals her real name and abandons her title as [...] "the Seer". Before the sisters can transform Kyra into a mortal, Zankou kills her because of her betrayal of the demonic world, and his fear of what she might tell the sisters. Her death is {{a turning point in the}} season as <b>it</b> <b>pushes</b> the sisters to agree to meet and help the Avatars build their new world.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{effects of}} the U. S. Immigration Act of 1990 on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) degree completion and labor market outcomes for native-born Americans. The Act increased the in-flow and stock of foreign STEM workers in the U. S., both by increasing green card allotments and by expanding temporary work visas via the H- 1 B visa program. These policy changes potentially altered the relative desirability of various college majors and occupations for natives. We examine {{effects of the}} policy on STEM degree completion, STEM occupational choice, and employment rates separately for black and white males and females. We identify the effects using variation in natives' exposure to foreign STEM workers and the geographic dispersion in foreign-born STEM workers in 1980, which precedes the Act and predicts future foreign STEM flows. We find that the Immigration Act changed natives' skill investment and utilization in three ways: (1) <b>it</b> <b>pushed</b> black males out of STEM majors; (2) <b>it</b> <b>pushed</b> white male STEM graduates out of STEM occupations; and (3) <b>it</b> <b>pushed</b> white female STEM graduates out of the workforce...|$|R
