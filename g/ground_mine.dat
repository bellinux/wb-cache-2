5|$|At 10:38 on {{the morning}} of 21 June, Fury detonated a <b>ground</b> <b>mine</b> off Juno Beach during a gale and the navy decided to tow her into the British Mulberry harbour at Arromanches where her damage could be evaluated. While waiting for a tugboat, she took on a 6° list to {{starboard}} from flooding. The Dutch tug Thames began towing the ship at 13:25; at 21:14, Fury accidentally collided with the stern of a freighter anchored outside the Mulberry, damaging her port side above the waterline, and the towline snapped at 21:49 when she struck another ship several times. She let go her anchor after drifting clear, but it almost immediately started dragging under the pressure of the wind and waves and the salvage ship Lincoln Salvor was secured alongside to steady Fury. Another tug made a towline fast at 22:18, but it immediately snapped when the tug began to pull forward. Lincoln Salvor had to cast off as her wooden hull was being damaged by slamming into Furys hull and six other tugboats attempted to tow the destroyer clear of the shipping in the Mulberry, but they all failed. Fury struck at least three other ships, including petrol and ammunition ships before she was driven ashore at 01:30. Her crew was able to walk to Arromanches at about 05:30 once the tide went out.|$|E

For a given <b>ground</b> <b>mine</b> except mine with radial symmetry, shadow appearance generally depends {{on the point of}} view. After a segmentation step performed on images acquired along a part of a circular trajectory of the sonar around the object, we can match and superimpose binary data. The resulting image displays a fuzzy shadow region whose pixels grey-levels depend on their successive localisation in the images of the sequence, i. e. if they belong or not to the shadow region. As an extension of feature extraction in the binary case, fuzzy geometry is a practical tool to describe fuzzy regions characterised by the degree of membership of each pixel to them. After a Principal Component Analysis applied to a set of fuzzy features, encouraging results have been achieved on simulated sonar images covering both classical and stealthy mines...|$|E
