ABSTRACT: Being an essential quality of the financial markets, market liquidity represent a big concern for both, financial authorities and investors. Liquidity offer depends on several parameters including the mode of organization of exchanges. The structure of the Exchange influence directly competition between investors {{and the quality of}} the information available to them. Thus, liquidity offer strategies differ from a order <b>driven</b> <b>market</b> of a quote <b>driven</b> <b>market.</b> Therefore, competition between liquidity providers depends on their liquidity offer strategy and differ in both markets...|$|E
40|$|There are two {{essays in}} this thesis. The theme {{is the study}} of {{microstructure}} of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK), an order <b>driven</b> <b>market.</b> Essay 1 is 'An Empirical Investigation of the Limit Order Book of an order driven market'. One of the characteristics of order <b>driven</b> <b>market</b> is that the limit order book is public information available to all traders. The first essay looks into the properties of the limit order book of SEHK. In particular, we make use of the economic concept of price elasticity to summarize the slope information of the bid and ask price schedule of the limit order book. We find that the shape of the bid and ask price schedules is concave. We also find that intraday pattern of the slope is an inverted U-shape. This indicates that demand of stock is relatively inelastic at the open and close of a trading day. Such results lend support to the Brock and Kleidon (1992) model. Essay 2 is 'Comovement of liquidity in an order driven market'. Chordia et al (2000) document the existence of liquidity comovement in NYSE, a quote <b>driven</b> <b>market</b> with market specialists providing liquidity. We make use of both the Chordia et al (2000) market model as well as principal component analysis to study liquidity comovement on the SEHK, an order <b>driven</b> <b>market</b> that does not have a market making institution. Our results confirm that liquidity comovement is a common feature of stock market trading, irrespective of market making arrangements. We also find that liquidity comovement is not a systematic risk priced by the market. However, we caution that a more detailed research should be conducted to look into the possible relationship between stock expected return and liquidity comovement...|$|E

We are also most grateful to the referee This paper models quote setting and price formation in a non-intermediated, order <b>driven</b> <b>market</b> where trading occurs because investors differ in their share valuations {{and the advent of}} news that is not common knowledge, and tests the model using transaction data on individual stocks in the ParisBourse CAC 40 index. As an extension of Foucault (1999), we show that the size of the spread {{is a function of the}} differences in valuation among investors and of adverse selection. Both GMM estimation of the model parameters and empirical evidence on spread behavior as the relative proportion of buyers and sellers in the market changes, provide strong support for the model. Our analysis yields further insight into the dynamic process of price formation and into the market clearing process in an order <b>driven</b> <b>market...</b>|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} years we have {{witnessed}} sweeping changes in trading systems all over the world. Those changes provided academics {{with an opportunity to}} look into the microstructure of different markets. Most empirical work in the area has concentrated on comparing changes in liquidity, volatility, trading volume and asymmetric information under different trading settings. Informational efficiency and spread sensitivity to volatility has been neglected however. This paper looks into informational efficiency and spread sensitivity to volatility under different trading settings namely a dealership, an order <b>driven</b> <b>market</b> and a hybrid market. We use FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 stocks as our sample. The evidence shows that order driven markets respond faster to information compared to dealerships and that spread is more sensitive to volatility in a dealership than in an order <b>driven</b> <b>market.</b> The degree of informational efficiency as well as spread sensitivity to volatility is the same between a dealership and a hybrid market...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate how Edinburgh Travel Agents are remaining competitive in a fast changing; technically <b>driven</b> <b>market.</b> There is a gap in the research, due to the limited amount of literature on travel agent’s perception’s in relation to the future of high street travel agents. With the current market becoming more technically driven it is important to see how travel agents are remaining successful, given that recent figures show high street travel agents are diminishing. The primary research was collected by interviewing 10 high street travel agents around Edinburgh. Independent, specialised and multi-chain travel agents were interviewed in order to gain the most representative data possible. Semi-structured interviews were chosen as it allowed themes to emerge which the researcher may not have accounted for, as well as gaining in-depth information regarding the research question. The findings were then coded and analysed. Two travel agents interviewed, stated how their companies do not use online methods, therefore, showing that they are managing to stay competitive in a technically <b>driven</b> <b>market.</b> Furthermore, they are expanding, suggesting that there is still a demand for high street travel agents. In addition, all bar one of the respondents said that they would choose to go to a high street travel agent rather than using online methods. One of the main outcomes from this study is that high street travel agents are still seen as popular and in demand by consumers. They continue to be vital in the hospitality and tourism industry, despite the advancing technically <b>driven</b> <b>market...</b>|$|E
