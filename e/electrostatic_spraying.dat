In simple terms chemical precursors are sprayed across an electrostatic field towards a heated substrate, the chemicals undergo a controlled chemical reaction and are deposited on the substrate as the required coating. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>spraying</b> techniques were developed in the 1950s for the spraying of ionised particles on to charged or heated substrates.|$|E
50|$|Cyrogenic grinding, {{also known}} as freezer milling, freezer grinding, and cryomilling, is the act of cooling or {{chilling}} a material and then reducing it into a small particle size. For example, thermoplastics are difficult to grind to small particle sizes at ambient temperatures because they soften, adhere in lumpy masses and clog screens. When chilled by dry ice, liquid carbon dioxide or liquid nitrogen, the thermoplastics can be finely ground to powders suitable for <b>electrostatic</b> <b>spraying</b> and other powder processes. Cryogenic grinding {{of plant and animal}} tissue is a technique used by microbiologists. Samples that require extraction of nucleic acids must be kept at −80 °C or lower during the entire extraction process. For samples that are soft or flexible at room temperature, cryogenic grinding may be the only viable technique for processing samples.A number of recent studies report on the processing and behavior of nanostructured materials via cryomilling.|$|E

Fields-driven processes, including (1) phase equilibria modification by electric fields and (2) magnetically seeded separations, as well as transport-enhancement processes by electric fields,including (1) surface area generation and (2) electroconvection, are discussed. It is shown that electric fields can change the concentration of the vapor phase during the distillation of a binary mixture, which may have applications in separations by distillation that consume significant amounts of energy. It is also shown that addition of colloidal seed particles of high magnetic susceptibility to a suspension of non-magnetic particles and subsequent flocculation between seed and non-magnetic particles form paramagnetic flocs that can be removed by high- gradient magnetic filtration. Inverse <b>electrostatic</b> <b>spraying,</b> which is the spraying of a non-conductive fluid (such as air) into a conductive fluid (such as water), is introduced and compared with normal <b>electrostatic</b> <b>spraying,</b> which is the spraying of conductive fluid into a non-conductive fluid.

Hot-boned beef outside rounds were inoculated within 1 hour after harvest with a cocktail of 8 serotypes of Shiga-toxigenic E. coli (STEC 8). Outside rounds were chilled upon transport back to Texas A&M University, and then hung on flame-sterilized meat hooks at 4 ?C for 36 hours to simulate a contaminated full carcass side in the chiller. Then, outside rounds were treated with lactic acid, lauric arginate ester, cetylpyridinium chloride, peracetic acid, or water (control) using conventional <b>spray</b> or <b>electrostatic</b> <b>spray.</b> Pre-treatment and post-treatment samples were excised from all rounds to evaluate the efficacy of all interventions and the mode with which they were applied.

40|$|The {{safety of}} fresh produce is often {{challenged}} by the sporadic incidences of outbreaks owing to Salmonella Typhimurium (S. T.) and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 (E. c.). Washing and current disinfection strategies do not completely decontaminate leafy greens such as spinach and iceberg lettuce. Therefore, more effective treatments are essential to ensure the microbial safety of the produce at the selling point. Here, a multiple hurdle approach was applied: (1) Natural antimicrobials - organic acids (malic, lactic and tartaric acids; MA, LA, TA, respectively) and plant extract (grape seed extract, GSE) and (2) Application method - <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>spraying,</b> was examined as a possible {{solution to the problem}} of production and post-harvest contamination of leafy greens. Comparisons of electrostatic versus conventional spraying and organic versus inorganic acid (phosphoric acid, PA) treatments were conducted. The concentrations of antimicrobials sprayed electrostatically were optimized using response surface methodology and determined as 3 % each of MA, LA and GSE. Malic acid (3 %) -LA (3 %) and MA (2 %) -GSE (3 %) combinations were demonstrated to reduce S. T. on spinach by 4. 3 log CFU/g and 3. 3 log CFU/g, respectively, when sprayed electrostatically. When combined with LA (3 %), MA (3 %) showed 2. 1 - 4. 0 logs CFU/g reduction of E. c. between the days 1 and 14 on spinach and 1. 1 - 2. 5 logs CFU/g reduction on lettuce. The <b>electrostatic</b> <b>spraying</b> of MA-LA-GSE (3 % each) showed reduction of 2. 6 log CFU/g of S. T. and 2. 3 log CFU/g of E. c. on the day 14 of incubation of iceberg lettuce. Conventional spraying of these antimicrobials did not reduce the pathogens efficiently. Though PA (1. 5 %) and PA (1. 5 %) -GSE (2 %) exhibited 1. 1 - 2. 1 logs CFU/g reduction of E. c. and PA (2 %) and PA (2 %) -GSE (2 %) reduced ~ 2. 0 - 2. 7 log CFU/g of S.

The combination of malic and lactic acids (3 % each) applied by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>spraying</b> is recommended for use in commercial applications.

50|$|Electrostatic {{painting}} was first patented in the U.S. by Harold Ransburg {{in the late}} 1940s. Harold Ransburg founded Ransburg Electrostatic Equipment and discovered that <b>electrostatic</b> <b>spray</b> {{painting was}} an immediate success as manufacturers quickly perceived the substantial materials savings that could be achieved. In <b>electrostatic</b> <b>spray</b> painting or powder coating, the atomized particles are made to be electrically charged, thereby repelling each other and spreading themselves evenly as they exit the spray nozzle. The object being painted is charged oppositely or grounded. The paint is then attracted to the object giving a more even coat than wet spray painting, and also greatly increasing the percentage of paint that sticks to the object. This method also means that paint covers hard to reach areas. The whole may then be baked to properly attach the paint: the powder turns into a type of plastic. Car body panels and bike frames are two examples where <b>electrostatic</b> <b>spray</b> painting is often used.|$|R

40|$|The electrospinning {{process is}} capable of {{producing}} fibres in the submicron range. Electrospinning has gained much attention {{in the last decade}} not only due to its versatility in spinning a wide variety of polymeric fibres, but also due to its consistency in producing nanofibres. Instead of producing fibres if charged droplets are formed then the process is called electrospraying or <b>electrostatic</b> <b>spraying.</b> In this research, it has been attempted to apply <b>electrostatic</b> <b>spraying</b> in the textile field for the coating of specialised textile surfaces. This process overcomes the disadvantages of the standard coating techniques. In the standard coating process, the polymers are impregnated into the interstices of the fibres/yarns, which results in alteration of the original properties of the textile substrate. Also, coating thickness cannot be achieved at submicron level, which increases the stiffness of the substrate. In electrospraying, the polymer droplets are deposited at the submicron level, which facilitates a thinner coating on substrates. Therefore, it is of interest to develop an understanding of spraying characteristics while a polymer solution is subjected to electrospraying. This research study investigated the effect of process parameters on polymer droplet diameter and its aggregation during electrospraying. Response surface methodology was utilised to design the experiments and evaluate the significance of process parameters on polymer aggregation. Applied voltage, solution flow rate, nozzle-collector distance and polymer concentration significantly affected the polymer aggregation and droplet diameter. Minimum polymer aggregation and smaller droplet diameter were observed at higher applied voltage, higher field strength and lower nozzle-collector distance. In addition, the development of a bicomponent polymer droplet deposition technique was successfully demonstrated in this research study; this technique can impart dual functionality to the textile substrate.

A distance of 5 - 8 cm was kept between the needle and the substrate. The applied voltage was 15 - 20 kV...|$|R

Microstructural properties of ESD coatings were optimised versus the composition of the precursor solution and the substrate nature. This chemical approach includes the influence of zirconia precursors, yttrium chloride, solvent mixtures, zirconia precursor concentration, additives and substrate nature in order to optimally tune the microstructure of the coating. A smooth, dense and homogeneous thin layer was successfully deposited...|$|R
