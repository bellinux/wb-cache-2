5|$|Castles, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{fortified}} {{residence of}} a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland {{as part of}} David I's encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with feudal tenures, particularly {{in the south and}} east, and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands. These were primarily wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, of a raised mount or motte, surmounted by a wooden tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey, both usually surrounded by a fosse (a ditch) and palisade, and connected by a wooden bridge. They varied in size from the very large such as the Bass of Inverurie, to more modest designs like Balmaclellan.|$|E

30|$|This paper presents, for {{sequences}} of sets, {{the notions of}} asymptotically lacunary statistical equivalence (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Wijsman) of multiplicity L, strongly asymptotically lacunary p-equivalence (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Wijsman) of multiplicity L and strongly Cesàro asymptotically p-equivalence (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Wijsman) of multiplicity L. In addition to these definitions, inclusion theorems are also presented.|$|R
30|$|Clearly if a set is {{strongly}} orthogonal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Birkhoff-James, then it {{is strongly}} orthogonal relative to every element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Birkhoff-James. If X has a Hamel basis which is strongly orthogonal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Birkhoff-James, then we call the Hamel basis a strongly orthogonal Hamel basis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Birkhoff-James, and if X has a Hamel basis which is strongly orthogonal relative to an element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Birkhoff-James, then we call the Hamel basis a strongly orthogonal Hamel basis relative to that element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Birkhoff-James. If, <b>in</b> addition, <b>the</b> norm of each element of a strongly orthogonal set is 1, then accordingly we call them orthonormal.|$|R

He begins by explaining how a child is genetically programmed to believe without questioning the word of authority figures, especially parents – the evolutionary imperative being that no child would survive by adopting a sceptical attitude towards everything their elders said. But this same imperative, he claims, leaves children open to infection by religion.|$|E
25|$|When {{bodies are}} acted upon by non-gravitational forces, as in a centrifuge, a {{rotating}} space station, or within a space ship with rockets firing, a sensation of weight is produced, as the contact {{forces from the}} moving structure act to overcome the body's inertia. In such cases, a sensation of weight, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> state of stress can occur, even if the gravitational field were zero. In such cases, g-forces are felt, and bodies are not weightless.|$|E

25|$|A {{small number}} of people are capable of conversing in Klingon. Arika Okrent guessed in her book In the Land of Invented Languages that there might be 20–30 fluent speakers. Its vocabulary, heavily {{centered}} on Star Trek–Klingon concepts such as spacecraft or warfare, can sometimes make it cumbersome for everyday use. For instance, while words for transporter ionizer unit (jolvoy’) or bridge (of a ship) (meH) have been known since close to the language's inception, the word for bridge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crossing over water (QI) was unknown until August 2012. Nonetheless, mundane conversations are common among skilled speakers.|$|E
25|$|The {{politicization}} of science <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> manipulation of science for political gains {{is a part}} of the political process. It is part of the controversies about intelligent design (compare the Wedge strategy) or Merchants of Doubt, scientists that are under suspicion to willingly obscure findings. e.g. about issues like tobacco smoke, ozone depletion, global warming or acid rain. However, e.g. in case of the Ozone depletion, global regulation based on the Montreal Protocol has been successful, in a climate of high uncertainty and against strong resistance while in case of Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol failed.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} recorded {{use of the word}} śramaṇa, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mendicant, is in verse 4.3.22 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad composed by about the 8th century BCE. The concept of renunciation and monk-like lifestyle is found in Vedic literature, with terms such as yatis, rishis, and śramaṇas. The Vedic literature from pre-1000 BCE era, mentions Muni (मुनि, monks, mendicants, holy man). Rig Veda, for example, in Book 10 Chapter 136, mentions mendicants as those with kēśin (केशिन्, long-haired) and mala clothes (मल, dirty, soil-colored, yellow, orange, saffron) engaged in the affairs of mananat (mind, meditation).|$|E

25|$|Members of the Deaf {{community}} {{tend to view}} deafness as {{a difference}} in human experience rather than a disability or disease. Many members take pride in their Deaf identity. Deaf people, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> community or culture, can then {{be seen as a}} minority group, and therefore some who are a part of this community may feel misunderstood by those who don't know sign language. Another struggle that the Deaf community often faces is that educational institutions usually consist primarily of hearing people. Additionally, hearing family members may need to learn sign language in order for the deaf person to feel included and supported. Unlike other cultures, a deaf person may join the community later in life, rather than being born into it.|$|E
25|$|From the {{descriptions}} {{that have come}} down to us through the writings of those such as Plato, Aristoxenus and, later, Boethius, we can say with some caution that the ancient Greeks, at least before Plato, heard music that was primarily monophonic; that is, music built on single melodies based on a system of modes/scales, themselves built on the concept that notes should be placed between consonant intervals. It is a commonplace of musicology to say that harmony, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> developed system of composition, in which many tones at once contribute to the listener's expectation of resolution, was invented in the European Middle Ages and that ancient cultures had no developed system of harmony—that is, for example, playing the third and seventh above the dominant, {{in order to create}} the expectation for the listener that the tritone will resolve to the third.|$|E
