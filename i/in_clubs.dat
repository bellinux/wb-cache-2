5|$|An initial {{pressing}} of 1,000 {{copies of}} the mixtape was produced and given to M.I.A.'s record label. The label began sending the copies out as promotional recordings, prompting Diplo {{to ask for the}} remaining copies to be returned so that he could distribute them at shows and <b>in</b> <b>clubs,</b> which he felt was a more appropriate method of distribution for the mixtape. He stated that around 2,000 {{copies of the}} recording were produced in total.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s, Berry {{was working with}} local bands <b>in</b> <b>clubs</b> in St. Louis as an extra source of income.

He also took guitar lessons from his friend Ira Harris, which {{laid the foundation for}} his guitar style.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of their second album, Led Zeppelin {{completed}} several more US tours. They played initially <b>in</b> <b>clubs</b> and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew. Some early Led Zeppelin concerts lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as bootleg recordings. It was {{during this period of}} intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess.|$|E

In 2008 Goldstein and Travis Barker formed the duo TRV$DJAM.

5|$|In 1943, {{after school}} and having {{enrolled}} at university, Waldron was called up by the army, and was based at West Point, in New York. This allowed him {{to listen to the}} greats of jazz <b>in</b> <b>clubs</b> on 52nd Street and elsewhere in the city. After two years in the army, he returned as a student to Queens College in New York, where he studied under composer Karol Rathaus and made the final decision to switch from saxophone to piano. This decision was influenced in part by hearing Charlie Parker's virtuoso speed on saxophone, and by not having the extroverted personality Waldron thought necessary for that instrument. Not yet a professional musician, he received money through the G.I. Bill and continued to live with his parents. After obtaining a B.A. in music in 1949, Waldron worked for a short time in rhythm and blues bands, including with Big Nick Nicholas.|$|E

5|$|In January 1956 Hope {{recorded}} with another rising star, Jackie McLean, for the saxophonist's Lights Out! In April {{of the same}} year Hope should have appeared on saxophonist Gene Ammons' The Happy Blues, but he left the record company's building before the session began and did not return. Hope claimed that he had gone to visit an aunt in hospital, but his absence was attributed by others to his heroin addiction. This had existed on and off for several years, and had led to at least one spell in prison. His drug problem and associated criminal record led to the withdrawal of Hope's New York City Cabaret Card around 1956, so he was no longer permitted to play <b>in</b> <b>clubs</b> in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} {{the highest number of}} local radio {{stations}} outside London including BBC Radio Manchester, Key 103, Galaxy, Piccadilly Magic 1152, Real Radio North West, 100.4 Smooth FM, Capital Gold 1458, 96.2 The Revolution, NMFM (North Manchester FM) and Xfm. Student radio stations include Fuse FM at the University of Manchester and MMU Radio at the Manchester Metropolitan University. A community radio network is coordinated by Radio Regen, with stations covering Ardwick, Longsight and Levenshulme (All FM 96.9) and Wythenshawe (Wythenshawe FM 97.2). Defunct radio stations include Sunset 102, which became Kiss 102, then Galaxy Manchester), and KFM which became Signal Cheshire (now Imagine FM). These stations and pirate radio {{played a significant role in}} the city's house music culture, the Madchester scene, which was based <b>in</b> <b>clubs</b> like The Haçienda.|$|E
5|$|Thin Lizzy, UFO and Judas Priest {{were already}} playing {{international}} arenas, when new heavy metal bands, composed of very young people, debuted in small venues {{in many cities}} in the UK. The country's larger venues were usually reserved for chart-topping disco music, because their use as rock music clubs was considered much less profitable. Like most British bands in the past, the new groups spent their formative years playing live <b>in</b> <b>clubs,</b> pubs, dance halls and social circles for low wages; this training honed their skills, created a local fan base and enabled them to {{come in contact with}} managers and record label agents.|$|E

5|$|Tobin began {{performing}} live shows <b>in</b> <b>clubs</b> {{with other}} Ninja Tune artists after releasing his second album, Bricolage. His shows generally contained music {{that he had}} produced during his career, mixed with modified songs from drum and bass, hip-hop, or other genres. Because his music was entirely produced in a studio with electronics, Tobin {{was not interested in}} adapting his music to suit a Live PA incorporating musicians. He instead used turntables which he felt had more in common with his approach to music production. He is known for building Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound speaker systems for his performances.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{first met}} saxophonist Charlie Parker in 1947. They played {{together}} in bands that included bebop musicians Dizzy Gillespie and Max Roach {{later that year}} for radio broadcasts. The pianist reported that Parker enjoyed his playing, {{in part because it}} was different from what Parker was accustomed to and did not copy the saxophonist's style. In 1948 Tristano played less often <b>in</b> <b>clubs,</b> and added Konitz and a drummer to his regular band, making it into a quintet. This band recorded the first sides for the New Jazz label, which later became Prestige Records. Later that year Warne Marsh, another saxophonist student of Tristano's, was added to the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{quantity}} of studio work created {{a conflict between}} Costa's need and desire to support his family, sometimes achieved through working day and night in studios, and his belief in developing his jazz talents, which would have required playing more <b>in</b> <b>clubs</b> {{and dealing with the}} people – agents, club owners, artists and repertoire men, and so on – whose goals seldom matched those of creative musicians. Notable examples of Costa's studio work from this period are being part of Gigi Gryce's final recordings as leader, appearances on Gunther Schuller's Third Stream album Jazz Abstractions, a series of small-group recordings with saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, and two tracks of Shelly Manne's 2-3-4, with Costa featuring on piano for one track and vibes on the other, both with just George Duvivier and Manne. Costa also contributed on vibes to Gryce's music for Fred Baker's short dance film On the Sound. A long association with pianist and arranger Ralph Sharon meant that Costa was the vibraphonist in the Sharon orchestra on June 9, 1962, when it played with Bennett at Carnegie Hall. Costa's final recording session was on July 12, 1962, as part of a group assembled by saxophonist Al Cohn mainly from the Benny Goodman band that had toured the Soviet Union earlier that year.|$|E
