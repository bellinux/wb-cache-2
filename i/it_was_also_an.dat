5|$|The title {{refers to}} the ancient Indian {{practice}} of a girl of marriageable age choosing a husband from among a list of suitors. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> affirmation to one of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's beliefs about an individual's right to make own choices. The film's English title for international release was mainly One's Own Choice, however it was shown at the Moscow International Film Festival under the title, On Own Will.

5|$|The ancient Indian Ayurveda {{tradition}} independently {{developed the}} concept of three humours, resembling that of the four humours of ancient Greek medicine, though the Ayurvedic system included further complications, such as the body being composed of five elements and seven basic tissues. Ayurvedic writers also classified living things into four categories based on the method of birth (from the womb, eggs, heat & moisture, and seeds) and explained the conception of a fetus in detail. They also made considerable advances {{in the field of}} surgery, often without the use of human dissection or animal vivisection. One of the earliest Ayurvedic treatises was the Sushruta Samhita, attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BCE. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> early materia medica, describing 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources, and 57 preparations based on animal sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{never took}} place. Instead, the fighter force {{was committed to}} the disastrous Operation Bodenplatte, designed to support German forces during the Battle of the Bulge. Galland's influence on matters was now virtually nil. Appalled by the Ardennes losses, he personally confronted Gollob and criticised him severely. Gollob contacted the Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Himmler's reputation {{as the most powerful}} man after Hitler at that time may have been a prime motive. Gollob complained about his misuse in the Luftwaffe and Galland's leadership. The SS had already spread their influence into other areas of military affairs including the V-2 operations. Himmler, whose relationship with Göring was poor, took the opportunity to exploit the dissent in the Luftwaffe and undermine the Reichsmarschall by supporting Gollob. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> opportunity for the SS to seize control of the Luftwaffe and for Himmler to oust Göring from power. Göring, for his part offered no support to Galland when Himmler or the SS were mentioned. On 13 January 1945, Galland was finally relieved of his command.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, the {{disadvantages}} of the East Coast Main Trunk route through the Karangahake and Athenree gorges became starkly apparent. The capacity of the line was constrained by several factors; its length, severe grades of up to 1:50, sharp curves of up to 6 chains radius, and light 55lb per yard rail which prohibited the use of the more powerful diesel locomotives. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> unreliable route, with frequent disruptions caused by slips.|$|E

25|$|Tbilisi (officially {{known as}} Tiflis until 1936), capital of Georgia, was always {{considered}} to be the fourth most important city of the Soviet Union, particularly in view of its political position as being the capital of the republic (Georgian SSR). The city grew quite rapidly during the 19th and 20th centuries, and apart from being a cultural and political centre, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> important transport hub in Transcaucasia and an industrial centre as well. All this amounted to the need for a rapid transit Metro system.|$|E

Michael Fennelly and Richie Hogan grabbed the vital goals, late in each half, while Henry Shefflin celebrated his record-equalling eighth title triumph with a seven-points haul. For Brian Cody, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> eighth Liam MacCarthy Cup success as a manager, and this one was achieved against the odds.|$|E

The band performed as a seven-piece, with Sarah Smith making a one-day return as a band member. Although the concert has achieved legendary status amongst Cardiacs fans, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> occasion on which everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. Among other things, Tim Smith's guitar fell apart and keys fell off Sarah Smith's saxophone.|$|E
