It had been estimated that, {{by the end of the}} program, PLABER would have reached its goals by 70% of the initial objective. However, the model established by this program did not have significative effects in increasing coverage, expanding infrastructure and improving service quality in rural and isolated areas.|$|E
25|$|The key {{development}} {{objectives of the}} power sector is supply of electricity to all areas including rural areas as mandated in section 6 of the Electricity Act. Both the central government and state governments would jointly endeavour to achieve this objective at the earliest. Consumers, particularly those {{who are ready to}} pay a tariff which reflects efficient costs have the right to get uninterrupted twenty four hours supply of quality power. About 56% of rural households have not yet been electrified even though many of these households {{are willing to pay for}} electricity. Determined efforts should be made to ensure that the task of rural electrification for securing <b>electricity</b> <b>access</b> to all households and also ensuring that electricity reaches poor and marginal sections of the society at reasonable rates is completed within the next five years. India is using Renewable Sources of Energy like Hydel Energy, Wind Energy, and Solar Energy to electrify villages.|$|E
