It was found that the partitioning of the salts followed the Hofmeister series. The partitioning of proteins with low surface hydrophobicity, myoglobin and cytochrome c, was little affected by hydrophobic polymers and salts. However, the partitioning of a protein with higher surface hydrophobicity, lysozyme, was strongly affected when polymer hydrophobicity was increased and a hydrophobic counterion was used. A protein with a relatively hydrophobic surface can be partitioned to a phase containing a thermoseparating EO-PO copolymer by using a hydrophobic counterion. The partitioning of lysozyme and cytochrome c in the polymer-water system formed after temperature-induced phase separation was also examined.

Partition coefficients {{of a series}} of dinitrophenylated (DNP) amino acids with aliphatic side-chains were studied in all the ATPSs at particular polymer concentrations. Free energies of transfer of a methylene group between the coexisting phases, ΔG(CH 2), were determined as measures of the difference between the hydrophobic character of the phases. Furthermore, partition coefficients of tryptophan (Trp) and its di- and tri-peptides and a set of p-nitrophenyl (NP) -monosaccharides were measured in all the two-phase systems, and the data obtained compared with the ΔG(CH 2) values obtained in the systems. It was established that for eight out of 10 of two-phase systems of different polymer compositions the partition coefficients for Trp peptides correlate well with the ΔG(CH 2) values. Similar correlations for NP-monosaccharides were valid for seven out of 10 two-phase systems. These observations indicate that the difference between the hydrophobic characters of the coexisting phases represented by the ΔG(CH 2) value cannot be used as a single universal measure for comparison of the ATPSs of different polymer compositions.

40|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{has been}} used to construct hydrophobically modified fusion proteins of cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi and tryptophan-containing peptides. The aim was to enhance the partitioning of the tagged protein in a novel aqueous two-phase system formed by only one water-soluble polymer. The system was based on a hydrophobically modified random copolymer of ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) units, HM-EOPO, with myristyl groups (C 14 H 29) at both ends. The HM-EOPO polymer is strongly self-associating and has a lower critical solution temperature (cloud point) at 12 oC in water. At temperatures above the cloud point a two-phase system is formed with a water top phase and a polymer-enriched bottom phase. By adding a few percent of <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>starch</b> polymer, Reppal PES 200, to the system, it is possible to change the densities of the phases so the HM-EOPO-enriched phase becomes the top phase and Reppal-enriched phase is the bottom phase. Tryptophan-based peptides strongly preferred the HM-EOPO rich phase. The partitioning was increased with increasing length of the peptides. Full effect of the tag as calculated from peptide partitioning data was not found in the protein partitioning. When a short spacer was introduced between the protein and the tag the partitioning was increased, indicating a better exposure to the hydrophobic core of the polymer micelle. By adding a hydrophilic spacer between the protein and trp-tag, it was possible to increase the partitioning of cutinase 10 times compared to wild-type cutinase partitioning. By lowering the pH of the system and addition of NaCl, the partitioning of tagged protein was further increased towards the HM-EOPO phase. After isolating the HM-EOPO phase, the temperature was increased and the protein was back-extracted from the HM-EOPO phase to a fresh water phase...|$|E
40|$|An {{effective}} {{system has been}} developed for purification of apolipoprotein A- 1 from Escherichia coli fermentation solution and human plasma using aqueous two-phase extraction and thermal-phase separation. The system included non-ionic surfactants (Triton or Tween) and as top phase-forming polymer a random copolymer of ethylene oxide (50 %) and propylene oxide (50 %), Breox PAG 50 A 1000, was used. The bottom phase-forming polymer was either <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>starch,</b> Reppal PES 100 and PES 200, or hydroxyethyl starch, Solfarex A 85. The top-phase-forming polymer and the surfactants are thermoseparating in water solution, i. e., when heated a water phase and a polymer/surfactant phase are formed. Recombinant apolipoprotein A- 1, the Milano variant, was extracted from E. coli fermentation solution in a primary Breox-starch phase system followed by thermal separation of the Breox phase where the target protein was recovered in the water phase. Both in the Breox-starch system and in the water-Breox system Triton X- 100 was partitioned to the Breox phase. The addition of non-ionic surfactants to the Breox-starch system had strong effect on the purification and yield of the amphiphilic apolipoprotein A- 1. In a system containing 17 % Breox PAG 50 A 1000, 12 % Reppal PES 100 and addition of 1 % Triton X- 100 the purification factor was 7. 2, and the yield 85 % after thermal separation of the Breox phase. Recycling of copolymer and surfactant was possible after thermal separation of copolymer phase. Approximately 85 % of the copolymer and surfactant could be recycled in each extraction cycle. DNA could be strongly partitioned to the starch phase in the primary-phase system. This resulted in a 1000 -fold reduction of E. coli DNA in the apolipoprotein A- 1 solution obtained after thermoseparation. In extraction from human plasma containing low concentrations of apolipoprotein A- 1, {{it was possible to}} reach a purification factor of 420 with 98 % yield. By reducing the volume ratio to 0. 1 Apo A- 1 could be concentrated in a small volume of top phase (concentration factor 10) with a yield of 85 % and a purification factor of 110. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that granule architecture influences patterns of reaction during chemical modification. Knowledge of granule microstructure provided {{in this study}} has advanced understanding of starch granule reactivity. A method for observing granular reaction patterns of modified starch is described that could facilitate characterization of starch reaction systems. ^ Most starch granules of common corn, waxy maize, sorghum, and millet were shown to possess radial, tube-like channels, which penetrated inward toward a cavity at the hilum. Channels varied in their frequency and distribution among granules, {{as well as in}} their depth of penetration. Central cavities, which were observed in almost all granules, exhibited a variety of shapes and sizes. Channels were not observed in starch granules isolated from corn kernels that had never been dried; rather they appeared to be formed during granule dehydration. The same is true of cavities, although the data is less conclusive. ^ Since channels and cavities increase available surface area for reaction and reagent entry into granules, their behavior was further investigated. Under slight swelling conditions (water), cavities were observed to swell somewhat closed, while channels appeared to remain open. Results from a model system (involving infiltration of granules with aqueous dye solution) supported the hypothesis that channels and cavities impact starch granule reactions. ^ To observe actual granular reaction patterns within modified starch granules, starch derivatives were converted to thallium(I) salts and viewed by SEM compositional backscattered electron imaging. Observation of a phosphorylated starch derivative and a <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>starch</b> analog revealed that granular patterns of reaction were influenced by both starch and reagent types. For waxy corn and sorghum starches, flow of reagent into the granule matrix seemed to occur through channels (laterally) and cavities (from the inside out). For potato starch granules, which do not possess channels, reagent diffused inward through exterior granule surfaces. With regard to reagent, POCl 3 (highly reactive) was more inclined to react at granule surfaces, while the propylene oxide analog (less reactive) appeared to diffuse further into granules prior to reacting. Together, the data support the hypothesis that granule architecture has an influence on the locus of reaction within a starch granule. ...|$|E
