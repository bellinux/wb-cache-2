As such, it is essential that the process of methodological design and development of course materials whether they are to be delivered in form of a CD-ROM or the World Wide Web for promoting multimedia learning be guided by educational theory.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} general {{phenomenon}} of induced-charge electro-osmosis (ICEO), nonlinear electro-osmotic slip generated when an electric field acts {{on its own}} induced charge around a polarizable surface, {{in the context of}} microfluidics. Simple ICEO flows are first observed around a platinum wire in a polymer microchannel. While convenient for scaling analysis of resulting flows, this geometry proved difficult to analyze because of sensitivity to measurement height. This motivated the development of microfabrication techniques for the creation of electroplated metal structures with clean surfaces for ICEO flow characterization. ICEO flows are analyzed in a simple geometry, with an electroplated metal cylinder and two outer electrodes on a glass substrate. ICEO flow velocities scale as V 2, where V is the potential drop across the outer electrodes, and decay monotonically with increasing frequency. Flow velocity also decays with increasing electrolyte concentration. Fixed-potential ICEO, with non-zero fixed charge on the polarizable surface, is demonstrated around a metal cylinder. A range of electrolyte solutions are tested in ICEO flow geometries and measured velocities scale well with effective salt diffusivity. Finally, we propose ICEO microfluidic systems as solid-state pumps and mixers for a variety of possible <b>applications.</b> (<b>cont.)</b> A range of electrolyte solutions are tested in ICEO flow geometries and measured velocities scale well with effective salt diffusivity.

This study investigated changes in rice yield and soil carbon sequestration over three years of RC application to an Andosol paddy field. The treatments were RC application at 0. 02, 0. 2, and 2 kg m− 2 (RC 0. 02, RC 0. 2, and RC 2, respectively), RH application at 0. 2 kg m− 2 (RH 0. 2), and a control with no RC or RH <b>application</b> (<b>CONT).</b> The results showed that RC 2 increased culm length by 4 % and straw weight by 14 % on average over the three years. These increases in plant growth coincided with a higher level of silicon uptake by the rice plants, although they did not significantly affect grain yield. The soil carbon content was progressively increased by RC 2 over the three years, whereas it was not significantly affected by RC 0. 02 or RC 0. 2. A considerable amount (> 72 %) of the applied carbon with RC 2 remained in the soil by taking account of its downward movement below the 10 cm layer of the paddy field after three consecutive years of RC application. We conclude that rice husk charcoal application to Andosol paddy fields is an effective option for increasing carbon sequestration. Furthermore, the increase in silicon uptake by rice plants suggests that rice husk charcoal can also be functioning as a silicon fertilizer...|$|R
40|$|A major {{emphasis}} in the Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) School of Trades and Technology is the adoption of an inductive teaching and learning philosophy. Teaching inductively starts with real-life applications as the context for learning. This is not something new; in fact, the approach comes by many names. The emphasis is on starting with the particular applications and moving to the more general principles.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to functionalize an existing polymer such that it better mimics natural tissue for tissue growth and regeneration. Numerous other processes have tried and accomplished this by non-specific protein adsorption, covalent attachment, biomolecule entanglement, and synthesis of new polymers with the desired functionality. The focus of this work is to modify the polymer's binding capability to cells while not altering the bulk properties. Through the use of both phage display of peptide libraries and yeast surface display of scFv libraries the surface of chlorine-doped polypyrrole (PPyCl) has been modified to facilitate binding of neuronal phenotype cells. The selection of peptides using phage display found a surface specific recognition peptide (T 59) that was made bivalent by altering the C-terminus with an integrin binding epitope. The bivalency of the modified T 59 peptide was exploited to tether phenochromocytoma (PC 12) cells {{to the surface of}} PPyCl. Furthermore the tethering of the cells to PPyCl through the peptide does not decrease the cells neuronal function and maintains the bulk conductive polymers characteristics. Using the peptide as a bivalent linker, the addition of other types of cells, drugs, growth factors, and enzymes could be incorporated for various biomedical <b>applications.</b> (<b>cont.)</b> An antibody (Y 2) specific to PPyC 1 was found using yeast surface display. This antibody was utilized to mediate cellular binding to PPyCl by expression of the antibody on the surface of PC 12 cells.

I have taken my fascination with a particular development in origami and put my belief in its potential for architectural application to the test by way of various investigations: materials and structural analysis, mathematical reasoning, manipulating space and form, parametric modeling, fabrication, and finite element testing. Parting from conventional, figural forms, mathematicians developed open-surface forms together with theorems that governed the ability of these folded forms to fold flat. I selected a particular form, the Kao-fold, for its simplicity, beauty, and structural properties and imagined many exciting possibilities, specifically for its application in designing a deployable structure. I analyzed its crease pattern, exploring variations and their corresponding folded forms. Simultaneously, different material ideas for larger-scale structures were tested and a particular configuration was assessed for internal stresses and its structural stability. Its transformation from a flat sheet to a folded state was scrutinized under the lens of mathematical reasoning, namely trigonometry, by linking the acute angle of its crease pattern and the dihedral angle in its folded state to its final folded configuration. The rigidity of this investigation was offset by the freedom afforded in manipulating paper models. As such, different spatial qualities and forms were explored while addressing the issue of scale and potential <b>applications.</b> (<b>cont.)</b> The transformational characteristics discovered were digitally simulated via the construction of parametric models, which was a more controlled manipulation of the form in a virtual space. In order to go beyond the realm of representation and address real-life building issues, a temporary open-air shelter was designed and constructed in detail. The goal was to tackle the complexity of assigning materials, designing components and fabricated them. As a final endeavor, the model's construction was tested for its structural stability using a finite element software. by Ken Giesecke. Thesis (M. Arch.)

This {{is due to the}} triangular conflictions among thermal stability (superparamagnetic effect), single-to-noise ratio and writability of the recording media. One of the most promising methods to overcome this constraint is the patterned magnetic media technology. Although it is facing many challenges, the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the possible milestones on the horizon for future of the disk drives industry. One of the biggest challenges for patterned media is to realize its mass fabrication provided reduced cost per bit. The basic fabrication approach is to use lithography to pattern the magnetic materials on the platter. However, patterned media requires well-ordered nanoarrays with dimensions less than 25 nm, which challenges the state-of-art lithography technologies. This M. Eng. project focuses on evaluations of the technologies and fabrication schemes potential for patterned media from various aspects like technical barriers, cost and intellectual properties. Technologies including E-beam lithography, nanoimprint lithography, templated diblock copolymer self-assembly and self-assembled magnetic nanoparticles are discussed. Cost modeling was done to prove the enormous gain in revenue for the proposed fabrication scheme. It is proposed that the fabrication scheme of templated diblock copolymer for making the master stamp for nanoimprint followed by nanoimprint lithography for mass production has the largest potential for patterned media. However, more R & D is needed for templated self-assembly of diblock copolymer before it is ready for this <b>application.</b> (<b>cont.)</b> E-beam lithography which is a mature technology can also be a choice for making the stamp followed by mass production enabled by nanoimprint lithography, without a significant loss of gain in revenue for ultra-high-density media fabrications.

It {{is hoped}} that the tool will be made {{a part of the}} physical/urban planning process when used by engineers and planners and used to address risks posed by landslides given the rapidly increasing concentration of population and the development of infrastructure and industry in the Baguio area. Reports and studies of individual landslides in the area are reviewed in order to discover the causal factors of mass movements and their interactions. The findings of these research works are discussed in the first portion of this paper. A description of the LANDSLIDE RISK RATING SYSTEM, remedial measures, and recommendations form the rest of the paper. This SYSTEM integrates different hazard (bedrock geology, slope gradients, vegetation) and risk (population, land use) factors. The selection of hazard factors takes into account the results of the analysis of causal factors of mass movements in the area. This analysis is based on the specific attributes of the subject study area, namely: a relatively extreme topographic relief, variable bedrock geology, and no significant differences in rainfall from one zone to another. The study assumes that the entire Greater Baguio area is subject to a uniform amount of rainfall during any given precipitation event. Although this study is area-specific it can have wider <b>application.</b> (<b>cont.)</b> Finally, the paper recommends that in future research work on this subject matter, soil and rock samples from various slopes be subjected to geomechanical testing to facilitate a mathematical analysis of slope failures. This can be the basis for a comprehensive database which can be used to create a Landslide Hazard Map where each slope in the Greater Baguio area can be rated. In addition, it would be beneficial to conduct an analysis of how Hazard Ratings may be reduced when particular remedial measures are in place. A site-specific preventive and remedial slope safety system for every slope in the Greater Baguio area would be the ultimate goal of future work. by Artessa Niccola D. Saldivar-Sali. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{theoretical and}} experimental {{results of the}} production of very high brightness electron beams using a 17 GHz photocathode RF gun. A beam brightness of up to 8 x 1013 A/([pi]m rad) 2 was measured for a 1 MeV, 1 ps, 50 pC electron bunch. Such high brightness beams are critically important as injectors for linear accelerators and free electron lasers. The present experimental work represents the first complete characterization of an electron beam produced by an RF photo-injector operating above 3 GHz. Previously published theoretical results show that beam brightness should scale very favorably with increasing RF frequency. Both a 1. 5 cell RF gun and a 2. 4 cell RF gun were designed, fabricated, and tested. Expected performance was determined through numerical simulations. Cold tests were performed by a novel "bead hang" technique. A beamline, including an emittance compensating solenoid, beam imaging system, and energy spectrometer, was designed and built for testing these guns. The RF guns were powered with up to 4 MW of microwave power from a 25 MW, 17 GHz relativistic klystron amplifier built in collaboration with Haimson Research Corporation. For the 1. 5 cell gun, 1 ps bunches with charge up to 0. 1 nC at up to 1 MeV were obtained at a peak accelerating gradient of 200 MV/m. The normalized emittance at the exit of the gun {{was determined to be}} 1 rmm mrad for a 50 pC bunch, corresponding to a normalized brightness of 8 x 1013 A/([pi]m rad) 2. This high value of beam brightness is very useful for <b>applications.</b> (<b>cont.)</b> Even higher brightness could be achieved with a higher electron beam energy of 2 MeV; however, RF breakdown in the tested structures limited the beam energy to about 1 MeV. Results were also obtained for the 2. 4 cell RF gun. While this gun provided a modest increase in beam energy to 1. 25 MeV, the presence of undesirable quadrupole modes in the structure led to a lower beam brightness. Techniques for further improvement of the RF gun are described. by Winthrop J. Brown. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Physics, 2001.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of mobile computing devices and wireless networking products {{over the past}} decade has led to an increasingly nomadic computing lifestyle. A computer is no longer an immobile, gargantuan machine that remains in one place for the lifetime of its operation. Today's personal computing devices are portable, and Internet access is becoming ubiquitous. A well-traveled laptop user might use half a dozen different networks throughout the course of a day: a cable modem from home, wide-area wireless on the commute, wired Ethernet at the office, a Bluetooth network in the car, and a wireless, local-area network at the airport or the neighborhood coffee shop. Mobile hosts are prone to frequent, unexpected disconnections that vary greatly in duration. Despite the prevalence of these multi-homed mobile devices, today's operating systems on both mobile hosts and fixed Internet servers lack fine-grained support for network applications on intermittently connected hosts. We argue that network communication is well-modeled by a session abstraction, and present Migrate, an architecture based on system support for a flexible session primitive. Migrate works with application-selected naming services to enable seamless, mobile "suspend/resume" operation of legacy applications and provide enhanced functionality for mobile-aware, session-based network applications, enabling adaptive operation of mobile clients and allowing Internet servers to support large numbers of intermittently connected sessions. We describe our UNIX-based implementation of Migrate and show that sessions are a flexible, robust, and efficient way to manage mobile end points, even for legacy <b>applications.</b> (<b>cont.)</b> In addition, we demonstrate two popular Internet servers that have been extended to leverage our novel notion of session continuations to enable support for large numbers of suspended clients with only minimal resource impact.

For example, the large number of air gaps left between thin ribbons would cause a decrease in the core packing density and decrease the efficiency of the transformer. So it is impor-tant to improve the GFA of ferromagnetic amorphous alloys to eliminate the limitation of the sample shape and dimension. Since the first synthesis of Fe-based bulk glassy alloy (BGA) in 1995, 2 a number of ferromagnetic BGAs have been devel-oped for the purpose of applications as functional and struc-tural materials. 3 – 12 Among them, Co-based BGAs are drawing increasing attention due to their excellent soft-magnetic prop-erties. 6, 11 However, few studies about ring-shaped bulk sam-ples with good soft magnetic properties have been reported in Co-based glassy alloys. Recently, CoFe(Ni) BSiNb BGA with high GFA was synthesized by copper mold casting, 13 which made it possible to produce ring-shaped bulk samples.

40|$|Colloidal {{semiconductor}} nanocrystals (NCs) or {{quantum dots}} (QDs) can be synthesized to efficiently emit {{light from the}} ultraviolet, across the entire visible spectrum, and into the near infrared. This is now possible due to the continual development of new core and core-shell NC structures to meet specific color needs in areas as diverse as optoelectronic devices to biological imaging. Core-shell semiconductor NCs are unique light emitters. They are more stable overtime to photobleaching compared to organic dyes. Their emission is efficient and their spectral full width at half maximum remains highly narrow as their size is synthetically changed to provide desired peak wavelengths of emission to within plus or minus a couple of nanometers. They can be purified and manipulated in solution and their chemical interaction with the environment {{is the same for}} all sizes and can be modified using chemical techniques. These unique properties make semiconductor NCs ideal for use in light emitting devices (QD-LEDs). This work shows how electroluminescence can be extended into the near infrared region of the spectrum by employing infrared emitting NCs as well as into the blue region of the spectrum by designing and synthesizing NCs specifically for this <b>application.</b> (<b>cont.)</b> Once efficient and color saturated electroluminescence at the visible spectrum's extremes had been realized it was a natural extension to begin exploring the potential of QD-LED devices to satisfy the technological requirements of flat panel displays and imaging applications. This led to the synthesis of a new green-emitting core-shell NC material to meet the specific color needs for flat panel display applications. At the same time we developed a new QD-LED device fabrication method to allow the patterning of the NC monolayer in our devices. Micro-contact printing the NC monolayer instead of using phase separation provided efficient and highly color saturated QD [...] LEDs in the red, green, and blue, and allowed us to pattern these monolayers towards the development of pixelated QD-LEDs such as needed for flat panel display applications. Along the way, the synthesis of colloidal NCs was studied to allow for more control in synthesizing higher quality materials in the future. The simple synthesis of PbSe NCs was used as a model system to begin to understand the mechanism of how the molecular precursors are reduced in solution to produce solid crystalline material in the presence of phosphorous containing molecules. by Jonathan S.

40|$|Catalyst {{poisoning}} due to sulfur compounds {{derived from}} fuel sulfur presents a major challenge, intractable thus far, to development of many advanced technologies for automotive catalysts {{such as the}} lean NOx, trap. Under lean conditions, sulfur will be oxidized to S 0 ₃ and then form sulfate on the trap. The sulfate on the trap is thermodynamically very stable and, thus, difficult to purge. The NOx trap will then be deactivated over time. Our objective has been {{to build up a}} framework for the design of selective, sulfur resistant, oxidation automotive catalysts, which are active for the oxidation of NO to NO₂ but relatively inactive for the oxidation of SO₂ to S 0 ₃. It is well known that the catalytic properties of alloys are often superior to those of pure metals, because of either the electronic effect or the ensemble effect or both. The ensemble effect is due to a change in distribution and availability of surface reaction sites, while the electronic effect is due to a change in electronic structure, leading to a change in rate constants of elementary steps. However, {{a very large number of}} possible compositions of alloys exist for any particular <b>application.</b> (<b>cont.)</b> Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the relationship between the electronic structure, the composition, and the activity of alloys, which could aid in catalyst design, is first developed. This is accomplished by constructing a generalized weighted d-band center model for the prediction of the binding strength of chemisorbed molecules, in which the various atoms in the molecules bind unequally to multiple types of surface atoms. This model is then applied to estimate the adsorption energies of SO₂ and NO at both initial states and transition states on various surfaces. Both energetic data and electronic structure data are obtained from first principles density functional theory calculations. Our model is found to predict well the relative stability of adsorbates on surfaces and can be used to predict the effects of different compositions on the energy of adsorption. A strong linear correlation is found between our new weighting of the positions of the d band of the surface and the molecular adsorption energy. These linear relationships are then used together with energy decomposition scheme for a coadsorbed system on surfaces, to predict the reactivity of SO₂ and NO oxidation on different surfaces. (cont.) A catalyst which is selective for the oxidation of NO over SO₂ is then developed. This study should aid in the development of more effective catalysts for an extremely important environmental application. by Hairong Tang. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Developing {{materials}} that interact effectively with surrounding tissue {{is a major}} obstacle in sensor and drug delivery research. The body's natural immune response prevents foreign objects from easily integrating with an organism. Without an intimate link between a biomedical device and the proximate environment, reliable measurements or delivery of molecules is not possible. Many of the current materials used for biomedical applications are centered on inert substances and polymers that degrade in the body but have limited functional capabilities. This thesis work addresses {{the need to develop}} {{materials that}} are capable of interacting in biological environments. Polypyrrole (PPy) is a conducting polymer that is a promising biomaterial for drug delivery and sensing applications. Because PPy is a polymer that can be made in degradable forms and because it can be stimulated electrically, it is an interactive platform for biomedical applications. By accomplishing the following research objectives, this thesis work could help develop an effective polymeric paradigm for tissue interactions: 1) Develop a new method to effectively micro-pattern electrodeposited polymers and metals for in vivo devices 2) Determine the optimal synthesis conditions of the conductive polymer, PPy, for sensor and implant <b>applications.</b> (<b>cont.)</b> 3) Fabricate PPy tubes to be used as nerve guides to promote nerve regeneration 4) Modify PPy for neurotrophic factor drug delivery devices and antibody-based sensing applications Through the use of standard microfabrication techniques, the patterning template upon which PPy is electrodeposited can be controlled precisely. By utilizing the growth mechanism of PPy on these templates, three-dimensional polymer objects can be created. Being able to micropattern the PPy and release the polymer generates the ability to create implants and devices that are completely erodible in the body. To develop the optimum conditions for sensor and drug delivery applications, PPy implants were fabricated and implanted into rat cortical tissue. Compared to similar Teflon implants, the electrically conductive PPy had preferable characteristics for material integration in the cortex. Additionally, PPy tubes have been designed and promoted peripheral nerve growth after tissue injury. By controlling the shape and morphology of PPy, the polymer implants formed an interactive bridge with their biological environment. By incorporating bioactive molecules into the PPy matrix, materials for externally controlled drug release and sensing devices can be designed. (cont.) Drug delivery was demonstrated through the integration of nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophic factor, into the PPy followed by triggered pulsatile release. Such neurotrophic factors can be used to promote neural growth in peripheral and central nervous system injury. Because PPy is easily modifiable through the use of dopants and control of its shape, PPy provides a flexible platform for novel polymeric-tissue interactions. by Paul M. George. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|We develop {{statistical}} methods which allow effective visual detection, categorization, and tracking {{of objects in}} complex scenes. Such computer vision systems must be robust to wide variations in object appearance, the often small size of training databases, and ambiguities induced by articulated or partially occluded objects. Graphical models provide a powerful framework for encoding the statistical structure of visual scenes, and developing corresponding learning and inference algorithms. In this thesis, we describe several models which integrate graphical representations with nonparametric {{statistical methods}}. This approach leads to inference algorithms which tractably recover high-dimensional, continuous object pose variations, and learning procedures which transfer knowledge among related recognition tasks. Motivated by visual tracking problems, we first develop a nonparametric extension of the belief propagation (BP) algorithm. Using Monte Carlo methods, we provide general procedures for recursively updating particle-based approximations of continuous sufficient statistics. Efficient multiscale sampling methods then allow this nonparametric BP algorithm to be flexibly adapted to many different <b>applications.</b> (<b>cont.)</b> As a particular example, we consider a graphical model describing the hand's three-dimensional (3 D) structure, kinematics, and dynamics. This graph encodes global hand pose via the 3 D position and orientation of several rigid components, and thus exposes local structure in a high-dimensional articulated model. Applying nonparametric BP, we recover a hand tracking algorithm which is robust to outliers and local visual ambiguities. Via a set of latent occupancy masks, we also extend our approach to consistently infer occlusion events in a distributed fashion. In {{the second half of}} this thesis, we develop methods for learning hierarchical models of objects, the parts composing them, and the scenes surrounding them. Our approach couples topic models originally developed for text analysis with spatial transformations, and thus consistently accounts for geometric constraints. By building integrated scene models, we may discover contextual relationships, and better exploit partially labeled training images. We first consider images of isolated objects, and show that sharing parts among object categories improves accuracy when learning from few examples. (cont.) Turning to multiple object scenes, we propose nonparametric models which use Dirichlet processes to automatically learn the number of parts underlying each object category, and objects composing each scene. Adapting these transformed Dirichlet processes to images taken with a binocular stereo camera, we learn integrated, 3 D models of object geometry and appearance. This leads to a Monte Carlo algorithm which automatically infers 3 D scene structure from the predictable geometry of known object categories. by Erik B. Sudderth. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis lies at the {{interface}} of microfabrication technology and advanced biomaterials synthesis and processing for use in designing and fabricating novel tissue engineered constructs. The unifying theme is to use micron and sub-micron fabrication strategies to form advanced tissue engineering scaffolds which are able to precisely control the microenvironment of cells. These efforts are organized into two thrusts; (1) materials synthesis and process development for microfluidic scaffold fabrication and (2) micro- and nanofabricated synthetic substratum for controlling cell function. In the first thrust, materials-specific processes for the fabrication of poly(glycerol-co-sebacate), a synthetic elastomeric biodegradable polyester, into three-dimensional, hepatocyte-seeded microfluidic constructs is discussed. Material advantages of natural proteins motivated the fabrication of next-generation microfluidic scaffolds using silk fibroin from the Bombyx mori as a bulk material. The need to combine the advantages of both natural proteins and synthetic polyesters motivated the synthesis and characterization of {{a new class of}} biodegradable elastomers termed poly(1, 3 -diamino- 2 -hydroxypropane-co-polyol sebacate) (APS). APS polymers are tunable and possess the advantages of both natural and synthetic polymers. APS polymers induce a favorable biomaterial-tissue response including reduced fibrous capsule formation and macrophage recruitment compared to PLGA. In vivo degradation half lives could be controlled to between approximately 6 and 100 wks by adjusting polymer composition and processing. The second thrust focuses on the interaction with cells and synthetically fabricated nanotopographic substrates for potential in vascularized tissue engineering <b>applications.</b> (<b>cont.)</b> The contact guidance response of human embryonic stem cells to poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) substrates with 600 nm ridge-groove geometry and 600 ± 150 nm feature height was characterized. This motivated the study of endothelial progenitor cell function and morphology on nanofabricated PDMS substrates. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were found to exhibit increased doubling time from 16. 2 ± 0. 8 to 20. 9 ± 1. 9 h for cells grown on flat and nanotopographic substrates, respectively. EPCs cultured on nanotopographic substrates had a faster velocity and enhanced directed migration. The average velocity of EPCs on nanotopographic and flat substrates was 0. 80 ± 0. 45 and 0. 54 ± 0. 27 pm-min- 1, respectively, while the effective displacement due to migration was 23. 6 + 12. 1 and 15. 6 ± 10. 1 Pm. Lastly, an in vitro capillary tube formation assay induced the formation of larger, more organized vascular structures in EPCs cultured on nanotopographic (411 ± 209 pm) versus flat substrates (140 + 35. 6 [mu]m). This work has validated the potential impact of microfabricated scaffolds in tissue engineering by modulating cell function and controlling microenvironmental parameters. by Christopher John Bettinger.
