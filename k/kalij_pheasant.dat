6000|$|We have as yet spoken {{only of the}} voice, but {{the males}} of various birds practise, during their courtship, what may be called {{instrumental}} music. Peacocks and Birds of Paradise rattle their quills together, and the vibratory movement apparently serves merely to make a noise, for it can hardly add to the beauty of their plumage. Turkey-cocks scrape their wings against the ground, and some kinds of grouse thus produce a buzzing sound. Another North American grouse, the Tetrao umbellus, when with his tail erect, his ruffs displayed, “he shows off his finery to the females, who lie hid in the neighbourhood,” drums rapidly with his “lowered wings on {{the trunk of a}} fallen tree,” or, according to Audubon, against his own body; the sound thus produced is compared by some to distant thunder, and by others to the quick roll of a drum. The female never drums, “but flies directly to the place where the male is thus engaged.” In the Himalayas the male of the <b>Kalij</b> <b>pheasant</b> “often makes a singular drumming noise with his wings, not unlike the sound produced by shaking a stiff piece of cloth.” On the west coast of Africa the little black-weavers (Ploceus?) congregate in a small party on the bushes round a small open space, and sing and glide through the air with quivering wings, “which make a rapid whirring sound like a child’s rattle.” One bird after another thus performs for hours together, but only during the courting-season. At this same season the males of certain nightjars (Caprimulgus) make a most strange noise with their wings. The various species of woodpeckers strike a sonorous branch with their beaks, with so rapid a vibratory movement that “the head appears to be in two places at once.” The sound thus produced is audible at a considerable distance, but cannot be described; and I feel sure that its cause would never be conjectured by any one who heard it for the first time. As this jarring sound is made chiefly during the breeding-season, it has been considered as a love-song; but it is perhaps more strictly a love-call. The female, when driven from her nest, has been observed thus to call her mate, who answered in the same manner and soon appeared. Lastly the male Hoopoe (Upupa epops) combines vocal and instrumental music; for during the breeding-season this bird, as Mr. Swinhoe saw, first draws in air and then taps the end of its beak perpendicularly down against a stone or the trunk of a tree, “when the breath being forced down the tubular bill produces the correct sound.” When the male utters its cry without striking his beak the sound is quite different.[109] ...|$|E
50|$|The silver {{pheasant}} {{is closely related}} to the <b>kalij</b> <b>pheasant</b> and the two are known to hybridize. The placement of the taxa lineata and crawfurdi has been a matter of dispute, with some treating them as subspecies of the <b>kalij</b> <b>pheasant</b> and others as subspecies of the {{silver pheasant}}. They have greyish legs as in the <b>kalij</b> <b>pheasant,</b> but their plumage is closer to that of some subspecies of the silver pheasant. Additionally, as the silver pheasant, lineata and crawfurdi are found east of the Irrawaddy River, a major zoogeographic barrier, while all other subspecies of the <b>kalij</b> <b>pheasant</b> are found west of the river (oatesi, a subspecies of the <b>kalij</b> <b>pheasant,</b> has sometimes been reported as occurring east of that river, but this is incorrect).

40|$|Cooperative {{breeding}} is an evolutionarily curious behavior, because helpers {{appeared to}} altruistically forgo opportunity {{for their own}} reproduction. In a population of <b>Kalij</b> <b>Pheasants</b> Lophura leucomelanos introduced to Hawai'i, we recorded cooperative breeding behaviors including caring for chicks, defending against conspecific intruders, and vigilance against predators. While cooperative breeding mostly occurs in altricial species, in which offspring need substantial parental care to survive, such behavior in the precocial <b>Kalij</b> <b>Pheasants</b> with relatively independent offspring provides an excellent opportunity to examine cooperative breeding and its influencing factors without the constraint of intense offspring needs. In our study population, <b>Kalij</b> <b>pheasants</b> formed stable social groups that usually contained one female and one to six males, and larger groups maintained larger year-round home ranges in general. One male was dominant among others within a social group, and age was the only factor found to determine dominance, indicating helpers can possibly stay in social groups and queue for dominance. Because high density was observed, we hypothesized that breeding habitat may be saturated, and that subordinate males cannot establish independent breeding habitat and subsequently remain in social groups. The removal of about one third of social groups resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} number and proportion of multiple male groups, and suggested that habitat saturation contributed to cooperative breeding in this population. To examine if helpers gained genetic benefits, we used 12 autosomal microsatellites and applied relatedness and parentage analyses to 88 adult and 82 offspring samples. On one hand, we found 34. 4 % subordinate males were related to the dominant male of the social group, indicating some helpers can gain inclusive fitness by helping kin. On the other hand, subordinate males fathered 16. 5 % of offspring sampled, suggesting that helpers can gain direct fitness be participate in reproduction. These results helped to understand the maintenance of cooperative breeding in this population; however, the causes for cooperative breeding can be complex in reality. In addition to examined factors, group-living benefits and life history traits may also {{have played a role in}} cooperative breeding in <b>Kalij</b> <b>Pheasants...</b>|$|R

60|$|When {{the young}} and the females closely {{resemble}} each other and both differ from the males, the most obvious conclusion is that the males alone have been modified. Even in the anomalous cases of the Heliothrix and Mergus, it is probable that originally both adult sexes were furnished--the one species with a much elongated tail, and the other with a much elongated crest--these characters having since been partially lost by the adult males from some unexplained cause, and transmitted in their diminished state to their male offspring alone, when arrived at the corresponding age of maturity. The belief that in the present class the male alone has been modified, as far as the differences between the male and the female together with her young are concerned, is strongly supported by some remarkable facts recorded by Mr. Blyth (5. See his admirable paper in the 'Journal of the Asiatic Soc. of Bengal,' vol. xix. 1850, p. 223; see also Jerdon, 'Birds of India,' vol. i. introduction, p. xxix. In regard to Tanysiptera, Prof. Schlegel told Mr. Blyth that he could distinguish several distinct races, solely by comparing the adult males.), with respect to closely-allied species which represent each other in distinct countries. For with several of these representative species the adult males have undergone a certain amount of change and can be distinguished; the females and the young from the distinct countries being indistinguishable, and therefore absolutely unchanged. This is the case with certain Indian chats (Thamnobia), with certain honey-suckers (Nectarinia), shrikes (Tephrodornis), certain kingfishers (Tanysiptera), <b>Kalij</b> <b>pheasants</b> (Gallophasis), and tree-partridges (Arboricola).|$|R

50|$|This {{is a very}} {{powerful}} and bold predatory owl, which is assuredly {{at the top of the}} avian food chain in its forested range. However, no extensive study of its dietary habits is known. Even in larger eagle-owls such as the Eurasian eagle-owl, although they can and do prey on a wide range of prey including impressively large prey, most of the diet consists of small mammals, often small rodents such as voles and rats. There is no reason to assume that the spot-bellied eagle-owl does not also take a very large quantity of relatively small prey such as rodents until complete dietary studies are known. However, almost all of the prey thus far reported for this species is very large and impressive, much of it being presumably as heavy or heavier than the eagle-owls themselves. Due to being most widely reported as being chased and eaten by spot-bellied eagle-owls has led some authors to list their primary prey as pheasants. Among these, junglefowl (Gallus sp.) and <b>kalij</b> <b>pheasants</b> (Lophura leucomelanos), both weighing from 500 to 1500 g, are commonly eaten, as well as Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus), which can weigh anything from 2.75 to 6 kg. The spot-bellied eagle-owl pounces on gamebirds while they're asleep on their perches in trees or bamboo clumps, often killing them in seconds with their powerful talons. Cases, where they've followed peafowl to their roosts and then pulled them out at sundown, have been reported. It also consumes an array of mammals, from small rodents to large prey such as golden jackals (Canis aureus), hares (Lepus ssp.), large Indian civets (Viverra zibetha), Indian spotted chevrotains (Moschiola indica), and even young muntjacs (Muntiacus sp.). These larger mammals are likely as much as 2 to 9 kg or even more. They will also opportunistically prey upon snakes, lizards (including large monitor lizards) and fish. Like several of the eagle-owls and fish owls but unlike most owls, the spot-bellied eagle-owl has been recorded as feeding on carrion. Thus far, they've been seen feeding on the carcases of goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) and tigers (Panthera tigris).|$|R
