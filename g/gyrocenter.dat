One was the displacement of their <b>gyrocenters</b> due to scattering near the outer part of the separatrix. This process tended to occur for high-energy electrons with correspondingly large gyroradii. The other was passage through the weak magnetic field around the center. This process was allowed for low-energy electrons.

40|$|Gyrocenter-gauge {{kinetic theory}} is {{developed}} {{as an extension}} of the existing gyrokinetic theories. In essence, the formalism introduced here is a kinetic description of magnetized plasmas in the <b>gyrocenter</b> coordinates which is fully equivalent to the Vlasov-Maxwell system in the particle coordinates. In particular, provided the gyroradius is smaller than the scale-length of the magnetic field, it can treat high frequency range as well as the usual low frequency range normally associated with gyrokinetic approaches. A significant advantage of this formalism is that it enables the direct particle-in-cell simulations of compressional Alfven waves for MHD applications and of RF waves relevant to plasma heating in space and laboratory plasmas. The gyrocenter-gauge kinetic susceptibility for arbitrary wavelength and arbitrary frequency electromagnetic perturbations in a homogeneous magnetized plasma is shown to recover exactly the classical result obtained by integrating the Vlasov-Maxwell system in the particle coordinates. This demonstrates that all the waves supported by the Vlasov-Maxwell system can be studied using the gyrocenter-gauge kinetic model in the <b>gyrocenter</b> coordinates. This theoretical approach is so named to distinguish it from the existing gyrokinetic theory, which has been successfully developed and applied to many important low-frequency and long parallel wavelength problems, where the conventional meaning of gyrokinetic has been standardized. Besides the usual gyrokinetic distribution function, the gyrocenter-gauge kinetic theory emphasizes as well the gyrocenter-gauge distribution function, which sometimes contains all the physics of the problems being studied, and whose importance has not been realized previously. The gyrocenter-gauge distribution function enters Maxwell's equations through the pull-back transformation of the <b>gyrocenter</b> transformation, which depends on the perturbed fields. The efficacy of the gyrocenter-gauge kinetic approach is largely due to the fact that it directly decouples particle's gyromotion from its <b>gyrocenter</b> motion in the <b>gyrocenter</b> coordinates. As in the case of kinetic theories using guiding center coordinates, obtaining solutions for this kinetic system involves only following particles along their <b>gyrocenter</b> orbits. However, an added advantage here is that unlike the guiding center formalism, the <b>gyrocenter</b> coordinates used in this theory involves both the equilibrium and the perturbed components of the electromagnetic field. In terms of solving the kinetic system using particle simulation methods, the gyrocenter-gauge kinetic approach enables the reduction of computational complexity without the loss of important physical content...|$|E
40|$|We present {{three-dimensional}} hybrid {{simulations of}} collisionless shocks that propagate {{parallel to the}} background magnetic field to study the acceleration of protons that forms a high-energy tail on the distribution. We focus on the initial acceleration of thermal protons and compare it with results from one-dimensional simulations. We find that for both one- and three-dimensional simulations, particles that {{end up in the}} high-energy tail of the distribution later in the simulation gained their initial energy right at the shock. This confirms previous results but is the first to demonstrate this using fully three-dimensional fields. The result is not consistent with the "thermal leakage" model.

Here we report a detection of geomagnetically-trapped tritium at energies from 14 to 35 MeV/nuc below L = 1. 2, at about 1 / 8 the flux of deuterium previously reported at that location and at similar energy per nucleon. We also demonstrate {{the utility of the}} SAMPEX/PET observations for measuring the east-west anisotropy in the trapped particle flux at low altitudes, which is due to displacement of particle <b>gyrocenters</b> from the position of observation in a region of strong flux gradients.

40|$|Gyrokinetic {{theory is}} {{a basis for}} {{treating}} magnetised plasma dynamics slower than particle gyrofrequencies where {{the scale of the}} background is larger than relevant gyroradii. The energy of field perturbations can be comparable to the thermal energy but smaller than the energy of the background magnetic field. Properly applied, it is a low-frequency gauge transform rather than a treatment of particle orbits, and more a representation in terms of <b>gyrocenters</b> rather than particles than an approximation. By making all transformations and approximations in the field/particle Lagrangian one preserves exact energetic consistency so that time symmetry ensures energy conservation and spatial axisymmetry ensures toroidal angular momentum conservation. This method draws on earlier experience with drift kinetic models while showing the independence of gyrokinetic representation from particularities of Lie transforms or specific ordering limits, and that the essentials of low-frequency magnetohydrodynamics, including the equilibrium, are recovered. It gives a useful basis for total-f electromagnetic gyrokinetic computation. Various versions of the representation based upon choice of parallel velocity space coordinate are illustrated.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the solar wind and the proton flux at geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) is investigated using the error reduction ratio (ERR) analysis. The ERR analysis is able {{to search for the}} most appropriate inputs that control the evolution of the system. This approach is a black box method and is able to derive a mathematical model of a system from input-output data. This method is used to analyse eight energy ranges of the proton flux at GEO from 80 keV to 14. 5 MeV. The inputs to the algorithm were solar wind velocity, density and pressure; the Dst index; the solar energetic proton (SEP) flux; and a function of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) tangential magnitude and clock angle. The results show that for lowest five energy channels (80 to 800 keV) the GEO proton fluxes are controlled by the solar wind velocity with a lag of two to three days. However, above 350 keV, the SEP fluxes, accounts for {{a significant portion of the}} GEO proton flux variance. For the highest three energy channels (0. 74 to 14. 5 MeV), the SEPs account for the majority of the ERR. The results also show an anisotropy of protons with <b>gyrocenters</b> inside GEO and outside GEO, where the protons inside GEO are controlled partly by the Dst index and also an IMF-clock angle function. © 2013 Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent {{dispersion}} of ion <b>gyrocenters</b> in a magnetized plasma is {{studied in the}} context of a stochastic Hamiltonian transport model and nonlinear, self-consistent gyrokinetic simulations. The Hamiltonian model consists of a superposition of drift waves derived from the linearized Hasegawa-Mima equation and a zonal shear flow perpendicular to the density gradient. Finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects are included. Because there is no particle transport in the direction of the density gradient, the focus is on transport parallel to the shear flow. The prescribed flow produces strongly asymmetric non-Gaussian probability distribution functions (PDFs) of particle displacements, as was previously known. For kρ= 0, where k is the characteristic wavelength of the flow and ρ is the thermal Larmor radius, a transition is observed in the scaling of the second moment of particle displacements. The transition separates nearly ballistic superdiffusive dispersion from weaker superdiffusion at later times. FLR effects eliminate this transition. Important features of the PDFs of displacements are reproduced accurately with a fractional diffusion model. The gyroaveraged ExB drift {{dispersion of}} a sample of tracer ions is also examined in a two-dimensional, nonlinear, self-consistent gyrokinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. Turbulence in the simulation is driven by a density gradient and magnetic curvature, resulting in the unstable ρ scale kinetic entropy mode. The dependence of dispersion in both the axial and radial directions is characterized by displacement and velocity increment distributions. The strength of the density gradient is varied, using the local approximation, in three separate trials. A filtering procedure is used to separate trajectories according to whether they were caught in an eddy during a set observation time. Axial displacements are compared to results from the Hasegawa-Mima model. Superdiffusion and ballistic transport are found, depending on filtering and strength of the gradient. The radial dispersion of particles, as measured by the variance of tracer displacements, is diffusive. The dependence of the running diffusion coefficient on ρ for each value of the density gradient is considered...|$|R

The familiar <b>gyrocenter</b> coordinate system, where the gyromotion is decoupled from the rest of particle's dynamics, is non-canonical and non-fabric.

40|$|Interesting plasmas in the {{laboratory}} and space are magnetized. General gyrokinetic theory is about a symmetry, gyro-symmetry, in the Vlasov-Maxwell system for magnetized plasmas. The most general gyrokinetic theory can be geometrically formulated. First, the coordinate-free, geometric Vlasov-Maxwell equations are developed in the 7 -D phase space, which {{is defined as a}} fiber bundle over the space-time. The Poincar{copyright}-Cartan-Einstein 1 -form pullbacked onto the 7 -D phase space determines particles' worldlines in the phase space, and realizes the momentum integrals in kinetic theory as fiber integrals. The infinite small generator of the gyro-symmetry is then asymptotically constructed as the base for the gyrophase coordinate of the <b>gyrocenter</b> coordinate system. This is accomplished by applying the Lie coordinate perturbation method to the Poincar{copyright}-Cartan-Einstein 1 -form, which also generates the most relaxed condition under which the gyro-symmetry still exists. General gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations are then developed as the Vlasov-Maxwell equations in the <b>gyrocenter</b> coordinate system, rather than a set of new equations. Since the general gyrokinetic system-developed is geometrically the same as the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, all the coordinate independent properties of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, such as energy conservation, momentum conservation, and Liouville volume conservation, are automatically carried over to the general gyrokinetic system. The pullback transformation associated with the coordinate transformation is shown to be an indispensable part of the general gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations. Without this vital element, a number of prominent physics features, such as the presence of the compressional Alfven wave and a proper description of the gyrokinetic equilibrium, cannot be readily recovered.

40|$|Abstract. A {{method for}} gyrokinetic {{simulation}} of low frequency (lower than the cy-clotron frequency) magnetic compressional modes in general geometry is presented. The gyrokinetic-Maxwell {{system of equations}} is expressed fully {{in terms of the}} com-pressional component of the magnetic perturbation, δB‖, with finite Larmor radius ef-fects. This introduces a ”gyro-surface ” averaging of δB ‖ in the <b>gyrocenter</b> equations of motion, and similarly in the perpendicular Ampere’s law, which takes the form of the perpendicular force balance equation. The resulting system can be numerically imple-mented by representing the gyro-surface averaging by a discrete sum in the configura-tion space. For the typical wavelength of interest (on the order of the gyroradius), the gyro-surface averaging can be reduced to averaging along an effective gyro-orbit. The phase space integration in the force balance equation can be approximated by sum-ming over carefully chosen samples in the magnetic moment coordinate, allowing for an efficient numerical implementation.
