40|$|Roll forming is {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} automotive industry to form High Strength Steel (HSS) and Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for structural components. Because of the large variety of applications of roll forming in the industry, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{is increasingly}} utilized for roll forming process design. Bending is the dominant deformation mode in roll forming and sheet materials used in the process are often temper rolled (skin passed), roller- or tension-levelled. These processes introduce residual stresses into the material, and {{recent studies have shown}} that those affect the material behaviour in bending. A thickness reduction rolling process available at Deakin that leads to material deformation similar to an industrial temper rolling operation was used in this study to introduce residual stresses into a dual phase, DP 780, steel strip. The initial and thickness reduced strips were then used in a 5 -stand experimental V-section roll forming set-up to identify the effect of residual stress on the final shape. The influence of residual stress and the effect of plastic deformation on the material behaviour in roll forming are separately determined in numerical simulation. The results show that the thickness reduction rolling process decreases the maximum bow height while the springback angle and <b>end</b> <b>flare</b> increase. Comparison with experimental results shows that using material data from the conventional tensile test in a numerical simulation does not allow for the accurate prediction of shape defects in a roll forming process if a residual stress profile exists in the material. On the other hand including the residual stress information leads to improved model accuracy...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, a simple model {{was developed to}} extend {{the application of the}} traditional flower pattern diagram as a design tool for roll forming. The position of a point on the strip as it passes through each set of rolls can be identified as a series of points in the two-dimensional flower pattern diagram. In three dimensions, these points will lie on a non-circular cylindrical surface having its axis parallel to the machine axis. Assuming that these points are joined by a smooth curve, the forming path of a point on the strip as it passes through the roll forming process can be obtained as a plane curve on the plane development of this surface. It was shown in previous work that the longitudinal membrane strain and, in certain cases, local curvature of the sheet are functions of the slope of this plane curve. In this work, the strains on both surfaces {{at the edge of a}} strip in the forming of a simple V-channel are measured using strain gauges. It is shown that near the point of contact with the rolls, the strains differ by nearly an order of magnitude from those determined from the simple model which assumes that the trajectory is a smooth curve. A modification of the forming path is obtained from the measured bending strains. Although the changes in displacement are small, the peak values of strain near the point of roll contact are large and a consequence of highly localised changes in the forming path as the strip passes over each roll. Measurement of this perturbation in the forming path is difficult as the region is obscured by the forming rolls. The technique described here permits the reconstruction of this path and identifies a new area of investigation of longitudinal strains in roll forming. These are often associated with shape defects such as bow, warping and <b>end</b> <b>flare...</b>|$|E

The trucks and decks can easily be modified (modding) to reduce weight, improve smoothness or look better. Modding tutorials can be found online. Decks are the major component of a board and where, on a standard skateboard, one would stand. There is {{a wide variety of}} decks with material ranging from wood to plastic, to paper. Most commonly, decks are made out of wood, as this gives it more [...] "pop" [...] and a more authentic feel. The average deck will have two kicks - a <b>flared</b> <b>end</b> used for leveraging the board - while some old-school models have only one <b>end</b> <b>flared.</b> During {{the early stages of the}} fingerboarding scene, decks traditionally had lower kicks like that of a Berlinwood Old Mold or a Tech Deck however, the [...] "default" [...] shape nowadays has medium kicks and low concave.

5000|$|A {{horn antenna}} {{is used to}} {{transmit}} radio waves from a waveguide (a metal pipe used to carry radio waves) out into space, or collect radio waves into a waveguide for reception. It typically consists of a short length of rectangular or cylindrical metal tube (the waveguide), closed at one <b>end,</b> <b>flaring</b> into an open-ended conical or pyramidal shaped horn on the other end. [...] The radio waves are usually introduced into the waveguide by a coaxial cable attached to the side, with the central conductor projecting into the waveguide to form a quarter-wave monopole antenna. The waves then radiate out the horn end in a narrow beam. In some equipment the radio waves are conducted between the transmitter or receiver and the antenna by a waveguide; {{in this case the}} horn is attached {{to the end of the}} waveguide. In outdoor horns, such as the feed horns of satellite dishes, the open mouth of the horn is often covered by a plastic sheet transparent to radio waves, to exclude moisture.|$|R

2500|$|Flares {{are most}} {{commonly}} gravity-fed from a dispenser inside [...] the aircraft's fuselage. These dispensers can be programmed {{by the pilot}} or ground crew to dispense flares in short intervals, one at a time, long intervals, or in clusters.

5000|$|Shown below on {{the right}} is one style of ready-tied bow tie; there is also a clip-on that does not go around the neck but clips to the collar points. Wearing a ready-tied bow tie at formal {{occasions}} requiring a black or white tie dress code is usually considered a faux pas, though at occasions such as Schools Leavers' Proms or ones at which the participants are unlikely to have had much experience wearing bow ties it may be commonplace. If choosing a self-tie/tie-it-yourself/freestyle bow tie, there are usually two shapes available: the [...] "bat wing," [...] which is parallel-sided like a cricket bat, and the [...] "thistle," [...] also known as the [...] "butterfly." [...] An example of each can also be seen below. Which is worn is a matter of personal preference. Some other shapes do exist; for instance, the Diamond Point, with pointed tips at both ends. This is a double-ended type, with both ends shaped, though occasionally, ties are tied in the single-ended type, in which only one <b>end</b> <b>flares</b> out to give the batwing or thistle shape, and the other remains thin.

40|$|Three {{sites in}} the Red Sea were {{investigated}} to assess the variability of composition in Holocene sediments of the backreef environment within 0 – 2  m of water depth. This is important because composition of the sediment is commonly used to estimate water depth in ancient carbonate rocks. The site located at the King Abdullah Economic City (Saudi Arabia) contains a fringing reef with the reef tract located {{very close to the}} beach at the north <b>end,</b> <b>flaring</b> to the south to produce a narrower backreef area compared to the other two sites. This geometry produces a north to south current with a velocity of up to 15  cm s− 1, particularly during high onshore winds. The sediments contain predominantly non-skeletal grains, including peloids, coated grains, ooids, and grapestones that form on the bottom. The percentage of coralgal grains in the sediment was significantly lower than at the other two sites studied. Om Al Misk Island and Shoaiba have a much lower-velocity current within the backreef zone and contain predominantly coralgal sediments from the beach to the landward edge of the reef tract. The two locations containing the predominantly coralgal microfacies were statistically similar, but the King Abdullah Economic City site was statistically different despite having a similar water depth profile. Slight differences in reef configuration, including reef orientation and distance from the shore, can produce considerable differences in sediment thickness and composition within the backreef environment, which should induce caution in the interpretation of water depth in ancient carbonate rocks using composition...|$|R
