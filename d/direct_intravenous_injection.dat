40|$|A major hurdle of {{cellular}} therapy for biological treatment of intervertebral disk (IVD) degeneration is the delivery method where current delivery methods {{are limited to}} intradiscal injection which can potentially cause further degeneration. Recent studies indicated that multipotential stem cells (MPSCs) from human umbilical cord blood home to injured sites and induce local therapeutic changes, thereby potentially addressing the drawbacks of direct delivery. We tested {{the effects of these}} cells on injured IVD using a mouse model of puncture-induced degeneration via two delivery methods. Caudal IVD underwent needle puncture, and MPSCs were injected indirectly (intravenously), or directly (intradiscally) into the nucleus pulposus. IVD were harvested for histological, gene and protein analysis after 14 weeks. Our finding showed limited homing ability of the MPSCs. However, regardless of delivery method, no engraftment or expansion of MPSCs was observed at the injured site. Contrasting to <b>direct</b> <b>injection,</b> <b>intravenous</b> <b>injection</b> neither improved the degeneration status, nor preserve disk height, however, both delivery methods increased glycosaminoglycan (GAG) protein and Acan gene expression relative to controls, suggesting possible paracrine effects.

40|$|Although {{nucleotide}} analogs like bromodeoxyuridine {{have been}} extensively {{used to estimate}} cell proliferation in vivo, precise dynamic parameters are scarce essentially {{because of the lack}} of adequate mathematical models. Besides recent developments on T cell dynamics, the turnover rates of B lymphocytes are largely unknown particularly in the context of a virally induced pathological disorder. Here, we aim to resolve this issue by determining the rates of cell proliferation and death during the chronic stage of the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, called bovine persistent lymphocytosis (PL). Our methodology is based on <b>direct</b> <b>intravenous</b> <b>injection</b> of bromodeoxyuridine in association with subsequent flow cytometry. By this in vivo approach, we show that the death rate of PL B lymphocytes is significantly reduced (average death rate, 0. 057 day− 1 versus 0. 156 day− 1 in the asymptomatic controls). Concomitantly, proliferation of the PL cells is also significantly restricted compared to the controls (average proliferation rate, 0. 0046 day− 1 versus 0. 0085 day− 1). We conclude that bovine PL is characterized by a decreased cell turnover resulting both from a reduction of cell death and an overall impairment of proliferation. The cell dynamic parameters differ from those measured in sheep, an experimental model for BLV infection. Finally, cells expressing p 24 major capsid protein ex vivo were not BrdU positive, suggesting an immune selection against proliferating virus-positive lymphocytes. Based on a comparative leukemia approach, these observations might help to understand cell dynamics during other lymphoproliferative disease such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia or human T-cell lymphotropic virus-induced adult T-cell leukemia in humans...|$|E

A study was therefore conducted evaluating a new method of imaging thrombus with platelets radiolabelled with a 111 In labelled monoclonal antibody, P 256, directed to the platelet surface glycoprotein complex IIb/IIIa. When the number of receptors occupied by P 256 was less than 3 % of the total available on the platelet surface platelet function, as assessed by platelet aggregometry, was undisturbed. P 256 was radiolabelled with 111 In using diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid, which achieved a specific activity of 185 MBq (5 mCi) /mg. No impairment of immunoreactivity was detected at this specific activity.

Of the six patients who received intravenous P 256, three had documented thrombus, two of whom gave positive results on P 256 platelet scintigraphy. The third subject had chronic deep venous thrombosis and was scintigraphically negative.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the concept that}} the vascular entrance of both bacterial and nonbacterial particulate material could lead to hepatic parenchymal cell injury, either due to post-phagocytic Kupffer cell activity or the marglnatlon of activated leukocytes in the liver. injection of denatured, collagen-coated particles as well as heat-killed bacteria were used as particulate challenges. Hepatic parenchymal cell injury in vivo during post-operative sepsis was evaluated by plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and orni-thine carbamyl transferase (OCT) enzyme levels over 3 - 72 h. AST and OCT levels elevated following either laparotomy plus cecal ligation (mild sepsis) or laparotomy plus cecal ligation with puncture (severe sepsIs), with the peak level at 24 h. In addition, the <b>direct</b> <b>intravenous</b> <b>injection</b> of either nonbacterlal foreign particles or heat-killed Pseu-domonas aeruginosa Into normal rats also produced a dose-dependent elevation of AST and OCT. The plasma level of either AST or OCT actually increased 350 - 400 % after injection of the non-bacterial particles. A similar dose related elevation In enzymes followed the intravenous injection of heat-killed Pseudomonas. To differentiate the potential contribution of activated hepatlc Kupifer cells versus activated marginated neutrophils to the in vivo hepatlc injury, we determined {{the release of the}} hepatic specific enzyme OCT by cultured hepatlc parenchymal cells when they were exposed to isolated Kuptfer cells or Isolated PMNs that were activated by exposure to dead bacteria. Bacteria alone when added to cultured hepatocytes did not induce significant OCT release. In contrast, activated PMN 5 but not Kupffer cells induced a significant (p < 0. 05) release of OCT from parenchymal cells into the culture media. Thus, in vivo transient hepatic parenchymal cell injury with post-operative sepsis may be mediated by the margination of activated PMN 8 in the liver.

Methods: In 12 dogs we measured blood flow determined by hydrogen clearance techniques (BF) in both gray and white matter by spinal cord puncture, and compared the results with BF measured by a catheter inserted intrathecally to avoid spinal cord injury. We studied <b>direct</b> intraarterial and <b>intravenous</b> <b>injection</b> of hydrogen {{in addition to the}} inhalation method because hydrogen is an explosive gas. Results: BF measured intrathecally with catheters adherent to either the ventral or the dorsal funiculus did not differ significantly from that of the gray matter. BF measured with a catheter inserted into the epidural space was about one fourth of the BF measured intrathecally. Values measured by the intraarterial injection method did not differ significantly from those obtained by the inhalation method. Conclusions: BF measured with a catheter inserted intrathecally reflects blood flow in the gray matter of the spinal cord. Using intraarterial injection of H 2, BF was safely and accurately measured while avoiding the risk of explosion. (J Vasc Surg 1997; 26 : 623 - 8. ...|$|R

MethodsCefpirome (1 g) {{was given to the}} micropig over a 12 -h period by <b>direct</b> <b>intravenous</b> <b>injection</b> and 6 -h continuous infusion (500 mg). Meropenem (250 mg) was administered either by 30 -min intravenous and 8 -h continuous infusion. The two drugs were assayed by HPLC. The pharmacodynamics of these drugs were evaluated by means of (1) serum killing curve against Klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended-spectrum β-lactamase, stably derepressed Enterobacter cloacae and methicillin-susceptible penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, and (2) calculations of index of surviving bacteria (ISB). ResultsThe bactericidal activity of meropenem against K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae in this in vitro/ex vivo model was excellent, with a 4 log decrease at peak concentrations. Meropenem produced a mixed concentration- and time-dependent, killing effect against E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. The ISB value ranged from 25 % to 30 % for E. cloacae. With concentrations above MIC for S. aureus (1 mg/L), cefpirome has a time-dependent bactericidal activity, as shown by the ISB ranging from 20 % to 80 % after 4 h and between 20 % and 40 % after an 8 -h drug exposure. For both antibiotics, the higher concentrations obtained just after intermittent injection had a rapid and strong killing effect against the strains tested, but the trough levels had no bactericidal activity. The continuous infusions produce consistent concentrations of antibiotic that can be maintained above the MIC, and the bactericidal activity of which ranges from 2 to 4 log 10 decrease of inoculum. ConclusionsIn the present study the micropig {{has been shown to be}} an adequate model for the pharmacodynamic investigation of cefpirome and meropenem. In general, continuous infusion appears to optimize the pharmacodynamic profile of the two tested β-lactam antibiotics. However, against Gram-negative bacilli, the administration of a loading dose prior to continuous infusion of β-lactams would eliminate the only potential pharmacokinetic disadvantage of continuous infusion and ensure the rapid onset of antimicrobial activity...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Long-term {{biodistribution}} of nanomaterials used {{in medicine}} is largely unknown. This {{is the case}} for alum, the most widely used vaccine adjuvant, which is a nanocrystalline compound spontaneously forming micron/submicron-sized agglomerates. Although generally well tolerated, alum is occasionally detected within monocyte-lineage cells long after immunization in presumably susceptible individuals with systemic/neurologic manifestations or autoimmune (inflammatory) syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). METHODS: On the grounds of preliminary investigations in 252 patients with alum-associated ASIA showing both a selective increase of circulating CCL 2, the major monocyte chemoattractant, and a variation in the CCL 2 gene, we designed mouse experiments to assess biodistribution of vaccine-derived aluminum and of alum-particle fluorescent surrogates injected in muscle. Aluminum was detected in tissues by Morin stain and particle induced X-ray emission) (PIXE) Both 500 nm fluorescent latex beads and vaccine alum agglomerates-sized nanohybrids (Al-Rho) were used. RESULTS: Intramuscular injection of alum-containing vaccine was associated with the appearance of aluminum deposits in distant organs, such as spleen and brain where they were still detected one year after injection. Both fluorescent materials injected into muscle translocated to draining lymph nodes (DLNs) and thereafter were detected associated with phagocytes in blood and spleen. Particles linearly accumulated in the brain up to the six-month endpoint; they were first found in perivascular CD 11 b+ cells and then in microglia and other neural cells. DLN ablation dramatically reduced the biodistribution. Cerebral translocation was not observed after <b>direct</b> <b>intravenous</b> <b>injection,</b> but significantly increased in mice with chronically altered blood-brain-barrier. Loss/gain-of-function experiments consistently implicated CCL 2 in systemic diffusion of Al-Rho particles captured by monocyte-lineage cells and in their subsequent neurodelivery. Stereotactic particle injection pointed out brain retention as a factor of progressive particle accumulation. CONCLUSION: Nanomaterials can be transported by monocyte-lineage cells to DLNs, blood and spleen, and, similarly to HIV, may use CCL 2 -dependent mechanisms to penetrate the brain. This occurs at a very low rate in normal conditions explaining good overall tolerance of alum despite its strong neurotoxic potential. However, continuously escalating doses of this poorly biodegradable adjuvant in the population may become insidiously unsafe, {{especially in the case of}} overimmunization or immature/altered blood brain barrier or high constitutive CCL- 2 production...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{radioisotope}} cisternography {{has become}} a widely used method for the morphological assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics by means of radioactive materials introduced into the subarachnoid space. This technique provides useful information regarding the intracranical subarachnoid CSF dynamics. A wide variety of radioactive agents have been used with varying success to make the CSF space visible. In particular, in respect to stability, molecular weight and half-life, (169) Yb-DTPA {{has been found to}} be one of the best radio-pharmaceuticals for cisternography. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the characteristics of (169) Yb-DTPA compared with (131) I-HSA in cisternography, based on the author's experimental data and clinical experience. Experimental studies: (1) After injecting (131) I-HSA, (169) Yb-DTPA and (99 m) Tc-pertechnetate respectively into the lumbar subarachnoid space of three groups of dogs, the author investigated serially the movement of these tracers with a scintillation camera and the transport of these isotopes from CSF space to blood by counting the radiosctivity of the blood samples with a well-type scintillation counter. The author observed that there is a good possibility that (169) Yb-DTPA will show the dynamics of CSF absorption in both spinal and intracranial subarachnoid spaces. (2) Ten ml of autologous whole blood was injected into the cisterna magna of dogs, and the injection was repeated 2 - 3 times at weekly intervals. Three to five weeks after the last injection, chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage was achieved. In both chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage dogs and control dogs, laminectomy was performed at C(2) level and silicon tube was cannulated into the intrathecal or intracranial subarachnoid space, and then, the intrathecal subarachnoid space was completely divided from intracranial subarachnoid space by extradural ligation. After 100 μCi of (169) Yb-DTPA was injected into the intrathecal or intracranial subarachnoid space, 1. 0 ml of physiological saline solution was injected into the same place from the tube. Then, CSF pressure changes were recorded continuously by the pressure transducer and blood samples were taken at regular time intervals from the veins in order to determine the amount of activity of (169) Yb-DTPA transported into the blood from the subarachnoid space. In control cases, the elevated pressure immediately after injection of saline solution decreased to the level of 100 - 150 mmH(2) O for the period of approximately 10 minutes. According to these pressure changes, large amount of (169) Yb-DTPA were transported into the blood from the subarachnoid space, but in chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage cases, prolonged elevation of CSF pressure was seen and little (169) Yb-DTPA was transported into the blood. These results suggest that the transportation of (169) Yb-DTPA into the blood from the subarachnoid space is closely related to the absorption dynamics of CSF in the intrathecal and intracranial subarachnoid space. Clinical studies: In clinical cases, the author tried to determine how clearly one can see CSF dynamics, particularly in the intrathecal subarachnoid space by (169) Yb-DTPA cisternography combined with the (169) Yb-DTPA transfer test. With the patient in a lateral position, a spinal puncture was performed at L(4) - 5 interspace. After measuring CSF uressure, the author injected 500 μCi of (169) Yb-DTPA into the lumbar subarachnoid space. Then scintigrams of the head and lumbar regions were taken 1, 2, 6, 24 and 48 hours after the injection. In addition, at varying time intervals up to 6 hours, blood samples were taken from the veins in order to determine the amount of activity of (169) Yb-DTPA transported to the blood from the subarachnoid space. Here, the author considered the (169) Yb-DTPA concentration curve in the blood from a time immediately after the injection up to 1 hour thereafter (when (169) Yb-DTPA was still located only in the intrathecal space), reflects the absorption dynamics of CSF in the intrathecal subarachnoid space. In normal cases, the concentration curve of (169) Yb-DTPA in the blood showed two peaks around 1 - 2 and 4 - 5 hours after injection. This finding agree with the canine experimental data. First of all, the author studied the correlation between the changes in the (169) Yb-DTPA concentration curve in the blood and CSF pressure. When CSF pressure was under 100 mmH(2) O, the concentration curve in the blood was plotted in the lower levels at about 1 / 5 of the height of normal CSF pressure cases. On the other hand, when the movement of (169) Yb-DTPA into the blood was rapid and little (169) Yb-DTPA went up into intracranial space, the CSF pressure was inclined to be somewhat higher. This means that (169) Yb-DTPA was rapidly transported to the blood from the subarachnoid space in the cases with high CSF pressure like a brain tumor case. There are some occasions to use (131) I-HSA instead of (169) Yb-DTPA in such cases. The molecular weight of (131) I-HSA is 100 times greater than that of (169) Yb-DTPA, and from this reason (131) I-HSA is less likely to be absorbed from the intrathecal subarachnoid space. In addition, the author may note that there was no close relation between the amount of CSF protein or CSF osmotic pressure and the pattern of concentration curve in the blood. In the next place, the cases which had subarachnoid hemorrhage following the ruptured aneurysm, showed various abnormal CSF dynamics, such as low absorption from the intrathecal space and from the parasagittal arachnoid villi and reflux of (169) Yb-DTPA into the venricular system. In some of these cases, when ventricular dilatation is strong and ventricular stasis of (169) Yb-DTPA is observed over a 24 hour period the (169) Yb-DTPA concentration curve came to show high levels when a great deal of (169) Yb-DTPA appeared in the ventricles. This may mean that CSF is absorbed from the ventricular system in pathological condition. Lastly, when performing (169) Yb-DTPA cisternography, it is very important to know whether (169) Yb-DTPA was injected correctly into the lumbar subarbchnoid space. To determine this, it is useful to monitor the (169) Yb-DTPA concentration curve in the blood for several minutes, in addition to taking scintigram of the lumbar region, because when (169) Yb-DTPA is injected extradurally, the (169) Yb-DTPA concentration curve in the blood shows the same form as that in the blood after the <b>direct</b> <b>intravenous</b> <b>injection.</b> As mentioned above, the author consider that (169) Yb-DTPA is an unique and useful radio-pharmaceutical for cisternography, particularly when it is necessary to study the absorption dynamics of CSF not only from intracranial, but also from intrathecal subarachnoid space...|$|E

There will be need clarifying a role as a member and who is resposible for team approach in medical care in future. 平成 14 年 9 月、厚生労働省では、「看護師等による静脈注射は診療補助行為の範疇である」と行政解釈を変更した。これを受けて、臨床現場では患者の安全を守るため、今までの慣習的な静脈注射の実施から看護業務の責任の範囲を明確にした実践のための組織の体制整備が必要とされた。医療施設における静脈注射を安全に実施するための組織的取り組みがどのようになされているのか、また、実施上抱えている問題は何かについてその現状を調査した。多くの看護職が静脈注射の準備、実施に関わりあっているが、医師や薬剤師との連携上の問題、業務分担の不明確さ、看護職の継続教育の必要性が明らかになった。今後、チーム医療の一員としての役割と責任の所在を明らかにしていく必要性がある...|$|R

Briefly, these effects include fever, polymorphonuclear leucopenia followed by leucocytosis, vasomotor disturbances, hyperglycemia followed by hypoglycemia, depletion of liver glycogen, hemorrhagic necrosis in the substance of rapidly growing tumors, alterations in the blood coagulation system, {{and the development of}} resistance to the same and other endotoxins. The generalized Shwartzman reaction is produced when two properly spaced <b>intravenous</b> <b>injections</b> are administered. References to changes in the level of blood lipides following <b>intravenous</b> <b>injection</b> of bacterial endotoxins are few in number. In 1942, Schrade (3) reported a decrease in all types of blood lipides within the first 8 hours {{as a result of the}} injection of bacterial pyrogens in the dog. According to Seifter et al.
