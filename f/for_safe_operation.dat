2500|$|Dies for {{bottle neck}} cases usually are {{supplied}} in sets {{of at least}} two dies, though sometimes a third is added for crimping. This is an extra operation and is not needed unless a gun's magazine or action design requires crimped ammunition <b>for</b> <b>safe</b> <b>operation,</b> such as autoloading firearms, where the cycling of the action may push the bullet back in the case, resulting in poor accuracy and increased pressures. [...] Crimping is also sometimes recommended to achieve full velocity for bullets, through increasing pressures so as to make powders burn more efficiently, and for heavy recoiling loads, to prevent bullets from moving under recoil. [...] For FMJ bullets mounted in bottle neck cases, roll crimping is generally not ever used unless a cannelure is present on the bullet, to prevent causing bullet deformation when crimping. [...] Rimless, straight wall cases, on the other hand, require a taper crimp, because they headspace on the case mouth; roll crimping causes headspacing problems on these cartridges. Rimmed, belted, or bottleneck cartridges, however, generally can safely be roll crimped when needed. Three dies are normally supplied for straight walled cases, with an optional fourth die for crimping. Crimps for straight wall cases may be taper crimps, suitable for rimless cartridges used in autoloaders, or roll crimps, which are best for rimmed cartridges such as are used in revolvers.|$|E

40|$|We present {{three cases}} of benign prostatic {{hypertrophy}} associated with chronic renal failure for three years from 1982 to 1984. Endogenous 24 -hour creatinine clearance (Ccr) on admission ranged from 8. 7 to 29. 4 ml/min. Temporary hemodialysis treatment was required in one patient {{at the beginning of}} hospitalization. Indwelling intraurethral catheterization for 3 months or more improved the renal function in one patient, but brought troublesome complications of gross hematuria, intractable urethral pain or recurrent pyelonephritis in the other patients. These complications might arise from strong uninhibited detrusor contractions triggered or accelerated by stimuli and/or urinary tract infection induced by urethra-indwelt catheters. Intermittent self catheterization reduced these complications in one patient. In two patients, Ccr increased beyond 30 ml/min as a desirable standard level <b>for</b> <b>safe</b> <b>operations.</b> Suprapubic prostatectomy was successfully performed in all the patients. However, severe gastric ulcer or fatal duodenal ulcer occurred in two patients. Hypoproteinemia and/or urinary tract infection was thought to be highly related to ulceration. In conclusion, we would like to emphasize that a Ccr of more than 30 ml/min is needed <b>for</b> <b>safe</b> <b>operations</b> concerning renal function in patients with {{benign prostatic hypertrophy}} associated with chronic renal failure...|$|R
