40|$|International {{governments have}} {{recognised}} that providing quality ‘Education for All’ {{is a top}} priority. In South Africa, there is a movement towards the global phenomenon of low fee private schools due to the government schools not satisfying the need for quality education. Sustainability of these schools is imperative as they are playing an increasingly {{important role in the}} South African education system. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} develop a sustainable <b>financial</b> <b>model</b> to ensure these schools are an attractive investment opportunity for all stakeholders. A two phased approach was used to develop the sustainable <b>financial</b> <b>model.</b> The first phase focused on ten interviews with managers and/or founders of low fee private schools to gather information on their <b>financial</b> <b>models.</b> This information was then consolidated into a <b>financial</b> <b>model,</b> which in turn provided a guideline used to interview ten experts from the educational and the financial business sectors in phase two. Two <b>financial</b> <b>models</b> were formed as a consequence and the combinations of these models form the sustainable <b>financial</b> <b>model</b> for low fee private schools. The sustainable <b>financial</b> <b>model</b> acts as a mechanism to ensure sustainability of low fee private schools. The Structural <b>Financial</b> <b>Model</b> (from phase two) has an “aerial view” and exhibits the necessary levers for sustainability. The Relationship <b>Financial</b> <b>Model</b> (from phase one) has a “terrestrial view”, which exhibits the relationship between the different levers in an organisation of a school. A combination of both models results in a sustainable <b>financial</b> <b>model</b> for low fee private schools. CopyrightDissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

30|$|Our {{orienting}} proposition {{is that as}} uncertainty and/or controversy increase, {{firms will}} increasingly evaluate potential deals via qualitative methods. The capital budgeting literature highlights both financial and qualitative decision-making processes. Financially driven approaches such as NPV will be most feasible when uncertainty and controversy are low: in those conditions, {{it is possible to}} identify meaningful parameters for <b>financial</b> <b>models</b> and settle on focal goals that the <b>financial</b> <b>models</b> can assess. By contrast, <b>financial</b> <b>models</b> are more difficult to use as primary decision-making tools when uncertainty and/or controversy increase. Uncertainty means that distributions for the variables in <b>financial</b> <b>models</b> will be unreliable; e.g., actors cannot specify meaningful discount rates for measures such as NPV. Controversy means that it becomes increasingly difficult to determine benchmarks by which to assess financial output or even to use <b>financial</b> <b>models.</b> We will use the orienting proposition as a base from which to explore the types of methodologies that arise as uncertainty and controversy vary.|$|R

40|$|An {{integral}} {{component of}} planning investment in forestry {{is the need}} for financial information about the likely cash flows associated with the establishment, management and final harvest of a plantation. <b>Financial</b> <b>models</b> provide a useful framework for the assessment of financial performance of forestry. A number of generic forestry <b>financial</b> <b>models</b> have been developed in recent years in Australia and New Zealand. A <b>financial</b> <b>model</b> is a tool that aids in the assessment of forestry projects, providing the means through which financial performance measures such as net present value (NPV), land expectation value (LEV) and internal rate of return (IRR) are calculated. Outputs of <b>financial</b> <b>models</b> should however be interpreted with caution.

40|$|Microcredit {{was once}} universally lauded in {{international}} development community circles as a 'magic bullet'. Using {{the example of}} South Africa, this paper shows that microcredit has actually been an 'anti-developmental' local <b>financial</b> <b>model,</b> {{and one of the}} most calamitous financial sector interventions in South Africa's short post-apartheid history. This disastrous performance is compared to a benchmark local <b>financial</b> <b>model</b> that I call the 'developmental' local <b>financial</b> <b>model,</b> a <b>financial</b> <b>model</b> that was quite decisive to much recent European and Asian local economic development success. Overall, microcredit can be viewed as South Africa's own sub-prime-style disaster which, like the original US version, has mainly served to benefit a tiny financial elite working within and around the microcredit sector, whilst simultaneously destroying many of the most important pillars of the economy and society. It clearly behoves policymakers in South Africa, as well as policymakers in other African countries and elsewhere in the international development community, to learn from South Africa's negative experience with 'anti-developmental' microcredit to date and promote alternative 'developmental' local <b>financial</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R
