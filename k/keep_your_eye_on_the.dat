[...] "If you can make it convenient to call at my office in the morning, we'll go over it a little.

Besides, her case is in my hands. I see now what a little, rag-tag, bob-tail, gotch-eared department I've been put in charge of. It seems to be about as important as an almanac or a hotel register. But while I'm running it, it won't turn away any daughters of Amos Colvin without stretching its jurisdiction to cover, if possible.

6000|$|He succeeded to admiration. He {{learned not}} to redecorate Holt Hangars, though he warmed it; to leave his guests alone; to refrain from {{superfluous}} introductions; to abandon manners {{of which he had}} great store, and to hold fast by manner which can after labour be acquired. He learned to let other people, hired for the purpose, attend to the duties for which they were paid. He learned--this he got from a ditcher on the estate--that every man with whom he came in contact had his decreed position in the fabric of the realm, which position he would do well to consult. Last mystery of all, he learned to golf--well: and when an American knows the innermost meaning of [...] "Don't press, slow back, and <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball," [...] he is, for practical purposes, denationalised.|$|E
60|$|That was the landlord's cue; {{and forth}} {{he came and}} did his part in the great {{eviction}} scene. There was no snowstorm ready for Elsie to steal out into, drawing her little red woollen shawl about her shoulders, but she went out, regardless of the unities. And as for the red shawl--back to Blaney with it! Elsie's fall tan coat was cheap, but it had the style and fit of the best at Fox & Otter's. And her lucky stars had given her good looks, and eyes as blue and innocent as the new shade of note paper, and she had $1 left of the $2.50. And the letter from Mr. Otter. <b>Keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> letter from Mr. Otter. That is the clue. I desire that everything be made plain as we go. Detective stories are so plentiful now {{that they do not}} sell.|$|E
6000|$|She {{laughed when}} she told me of her little brother's very first day at the farm. The farmer was, for a devil, considerate, and gave him {{something}} very light for a beginning, which was to scare the birds from the ricks. [...] "And if they will come back you must catch them," [...] he said, and left the little fellow to obey the difficult command as he could. The birds that worried him most were the fowls, for however often he hunted them away they would come back again. Eventually, he found some string, with which he made some little loops fastened to sticks, and these he arranged on a spot of ground he had cleared, scattering a few grains of corn on it to attract the [...] "birds." [...] By this means he succeeded in capturing three of the robbers, and when the farmer came round at noon to see how he was getting on, the little fellow showed him his captures. [...] "These are not birds," [...] said the farmer, [...] "they are fowls, and don't you trouble yourself any more about them, but <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sparrows and little birds and rooks and jackdaws that come to pull the straws out." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I don't doubt {{but what}} a lot of the Germans are loyal to this country," [...] came from Spouter. [...] "Just the same, it's a good thing to <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be sure {{to call me}} at sunset, and <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> those fellows all the time. I don't reckon there's {{much chance}} of their {{being able to get}} free; but we mustn't run any risks." ...|$|R
