25|$|Originally, Fannie had an 'explicit guarantee' {{from the}} {{government}}; <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> in trouble, the government promised to bail it out. This changed in 1968. Ginnie Mae was split off from Fannie. Ginnie retained the explicit guarantee. Fannie, however, became a private corporation, chartered by Congress {{and with a}} direct line of credit to the US Treasury. It was its nature as a Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) that provided the 'implied guarantee' for their borrowing. The charter also limited their business activity to the mortgage market. In this regard, although they were a private company, they could not operate like a regular private company.|$|E
500|$|In October 2003, Levine told USA Today, {{regarding}} {{the success of}} the song, [...] "I didn't love or hate the song, and I didn't care <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> on the album. We have a lot of pop songs on our record, and the idea was to start out with something different. Why come out of the gate with another pop song by another pop band?" [...] The following year, the band released an EP titled 1.22.03.Acoustic (2004), which features [...] "Harder to Breathe" [...] in an acoustic version. In 2005, Maroon 5 released a live album, Live – Friday the 13th, which features the song performed live.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{political}} scientists Matthew Goodwin and Robert Ford, the Referendum Party was [...] "a classic single-issue party". Similarly, {{the political}} scientists Neil Carter, Mark Evans, Keith Alderman, and Simon Gorham {{described it as a}} [...] "single-issue movement" [...] that had attributes of both a political party and a pressure group. While it took part in elections, it focused on a single issue and stated that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> Members of Parliament (MP) elected their sole aim would be to secure a referendum. It also claimed that on achieving its main aim, the party would disband, unlike most political parties; as Goldsmith put in his October 1995 [...] "Statement of Aims": [...] "This is a single-issue biodegradable party which will be dissolved once we have achieved our aim." ...|$|E

500|$|The retiarius {{held the}} dagger {{in his left}} hand. The gladiator could use the dagger to cut his net free <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> snagged on his trident. He might fight with the trident {{in one hand and}} the dagger in the other, but this negated the {{advantage}} of distance afforded by the longer weapon when wielded by itself. The dagger also served as a backup should the retiarius lose both net and trident. He attacked with the dagger when he had the element of surprise and could attempt to wrestle the secutor to the ground. Fights could devolve into straight wrestling matches in such situations, perhaps with daggers. Should the retiarius win and be ordered to kill his rival, he used his knife to stab him or cut his throat. Evidence shows that retiarii could be quite successful combatants; a tombstone from Gaul reads, [...] " [...] the retiarius, L. Pompeius, winner of nine crowns, born in Vienna, twenty-five years of age. His wife put this up with her own money for her wonderful spouse." [...] Nevertheless, the gladiators themselves were prone to boast: A graffito at Pompeii shows the retiarius Antigonus, who claims a ridiculous 2,112victories, facing a challenger called Superbus, who has won but a single fight.|$|E
2500|$|Barton favors {{repealing}} the Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare). Explaining why the American Health Care Act (the House Republicans' bill to repeal and replace for the Affordable Care Act) failed in March 2017, Barton said, [...] "Sometimes you’re playing fantasy football and sometimes you’re {{in the real}} game. We knew the president, {{if we could get}} a repeal bill to his desk, would almost certainly veto it. This time we knew <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> to the president’s desk it would be signed.” ...|$|E
2500|$|At lunch she {{distributed}} the questionnaire to 17 other assistant district attorneys personally. Most accepted them. Waldron learned {{what was happening}} and called Connick about a [...] "mini-insurrection" [...] taking place. Connick was particularly disturbed by questions about whether respondents felt confident in Waldron, Bane and other supervisors, and about whether ADAs felt pressured to work on his political campaigns, feeling it would be damaging <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> into the media. He called Myers into his office and told her she was fired, effective {{at the end of the}} day. She continued to come in for another three days, putting her files and case notes in order.|$|E

2500|$|Orr has a {{bucktoothed}} {{smile and}} frequently puts crabapples or horse chestnuts in {{his cheeks and}} rubber balls in his hands. He constantly teases Yossarian asking him {{if he wants to}} know why, to which Yossarian invariably says [...] "yes". Orr never gives any straightforward explanation for this other than he wants big cheeks and to detract from the peculiarity of this he keeps rubber balls in his hands. As he explains the latter, [...] "Every time someone asked me why I was walking around with crab apples in my cheeks, I'd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands, not my cheeks. It was a good story. But I never knew <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> across or not, since it's pretty tough to make people understand you when you're talking to them with two crab apples in your cheeks." ...|$|E
