5|$|Lynching was {{a terrifying}} and {{relatively}} uncommon spectacle. It could involve victims being hanged furtively by a mob at night, or {{in front of}} hundreds or <b>even</b> <b>thousands</b> of witnesses during the day. An audience of 10,000, including the mayor and chief of police, {{was said to have}} attended the lynching of Jesse Washington in Waco, Texas, in 1916. As well as being hanged, victims were sometimes burned alive and tortured, and body parts were removed and kept as souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|The mintage of 15,000 {{was struck}} in July 1936. At the Philadelphia and Denver mints, 5,005 pieces were produced, and 5,006 at San Francisco, with the excess from the <b>even</b> <b>thousands</b> held for {{inspection}} and testing at the 1937 meeting of the United States Assay Commission. The first 200 pieces from each mint were collected in sets of three, with a notarized letter from Melish testifying to what number coins they were. Several of these special sets were sent by Melish to government officials.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} {{piercing}} or not piercing are varied. Some people pierce for religious or spiritual reasons, while others pierce for self-expression, for aesthetic value, for sexual pleasure, {{to conform to}} their culture or to rebel against it. Some forms of piercing remain controversial, particularly when applied to youth. The display or placement of piercings have been restricted by schools, employers and religious groups. In spite of the controversy, some people have practiced extreme forms of body piercing, with Guinness bestowing World Records on individuals with hundreds and <b>even</b> <b>thousands</b> of permanent and temporary piercings.|$|E

5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} of use and misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems <b>even</b> <b>thousands</b> of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E
5|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult to predict good conditions for nucleation or growth of well-ordered crystals. In practice, favorable conditions are identified by screening; a very large batch of the molecules is prepared, and a wide variety of crystallization solutions are tested. Hundreds, <b>even</b> <b>thousands,</b> of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one. The various conditions can use one or more physical mechanisms to lower the solubility of the molecule; for example, some may change the pH, some contain salts of the Hofmeister series or chemicals that lower the dielectric constant of the solution, and still others contain large polymers such as polyethylene glycol that drive the molecule out of solution by entropic effects. It is also common to try several temperatures for encouraging crystallization, or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes supersaturated. These methods require large amounts of the target molecule, as they use high concentration of the molecule(s) to be crystallized. Due to the difficulty in obtaining such large quantities (milligrams) of crystallization-grade protein, robots have been developed that are capable of accurately dispensing crystallization trial drops that are in the order of 100 nanoliters in volume. This means that 10-fold less protein is used per experiment when compared to crystallization trials set up by hand (in the order of 1 microliter).|$|E
5|$|The first {{potential}} {{evidence for}} herding or flocking as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups {{in addition to}} birds was the 1878 discovery of 31Iguanodon bernissartensis, ornithischians that were then thought to have perished together in Bernissart, Belgium, after they fell into a deep, flooded sinkhole and drowned. Other mass-death sites have been discovered subsequently. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or <b>even</b> <b>thousands</b> of herbivores indicate that duck-bills (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the American bison or the African Springbok. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in Oxfordshire, England, {{although there is no}} evidence for specific herd structures. Congregating into herds may have evolved for defense, for migratory purposes, or to provide protection for young. There is evidence that many types of slow-growing dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in Inner Mongolia that has yielded the remains of over 20 Sinornithomimus, from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud. The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as pack hunters working together to bring down large prey. However, this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds, crocodiles, and other reptiles, and the taphonomic evidence suggesting mammal-like pack hunting in such theropods as Deinonychus and Allosaurus can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern diapsid predators.|$|E
50|$|A {{small number}} of coins from each year and mint were put aside for {{inspection}} by the following year's Assay Commission; the above figures include such pieces. This accounts for the variance from the <b>even</b> <b>thousand</b> mintages in 1933 and after.|$|R

25|$|Crime and detective {{fiction has}} enjoyed wide {{popularity}} in Tamil Nadu since the 1930s. Popular authors {{in the years}} before independence included Kurumbur Kuppusami and Vaduvur Duraisami Iyengar. In the 1950s and '60s, Tamilvanan's detective hero Shankarlal carried readers to a variety of foreign locales, while using a pure Tamil with very few Hindi or English loan words. These writers are often extremely prolific, with hundreds or <b>even</b> <b>thousands</b> of short novels to their credit, and one or more short novel published in a monthly periodical. Indra Soundar Rajan, another popular modern author, writes supernatural crime thrillers usually based around Hindu mythology.|$|E
25|$|These {{cetaceans}} {{are highly}} sociable and they regularly form small groups, or pods, that may contain {{between two and}} 25 individuals, {{with an average of}} 10 members. Pods tend to be unstable, meaning individuals tend to move from pod to pod. Radio tracking has even shown belugas can start out in one pod and within a few days be hundreds of miles away from that pod. These pods contain animals of both sexes, and are led by a dominant male. Many hundreds and <b>even</b> <b>thousands</b> of individuals can be present when the pods join together in river estuaries during the summer. This can represent a significant proportion of the total population and is when they are most vulnerable to being hunted.|$|E
25|$|The Austrian Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung– ZPO) {{does not}} provide for a special {{proceeding}} for complex class action litigation. However, Austrian consumer organizations (Verein für Konsumenteninformation/VKI and the Federal Chamber of Labour/Bundesarbeitskammer) have, in recent years, brought claims on behalf of hundreds or <b>even</b> <b>thousands</b> of consumers. In these cases the individual consumers assigned their claims to one entity, who has then brought an ordinary (two party) lawsuit over the assigned claims. The monetary benefits were redistributed among the class. This technique, soon labelled as “class action Austrian style”, allows for a significant reduction of overall costs. The Austrian Supreme Court, in a recent judgment, has confirmed the legal admissibility of these lawsuits {{under the condition that}} all claims are essentially based on the same grounds.|$|E

When two dyestuffs are perfused simultaneously, the liver separates them to a lower or higher degree, some times {{to such an extent that}} the secretion of one of them is entirely suppressed by the other. Which one of the two dyestuffs appears prevailingly in the secretion, does not depend upon its diffusibility or lipoid solubility, but perhaps upon its adsorbability. This is concluded from the fact that dyestuffs provided with several (4 to 5) strongly hydrophilic sulfonate groups in their molecule, are not permitted to pass the gland...|$|R
