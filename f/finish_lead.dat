Each lead had a different color since relative polarity or phase was more important for these transformers. Intermediate-frequency tuned transformers were coded blue and red for the primary and green and black for the secondary.|$|R

The songs [...] "Communion with the sun" [...] and [...] "Sunburst Finish" [...] are almost entirely different takes, Communion with the sun having a more aggressive drum track, alternate vocals and instrument solos. Sunburst <b>Finish</b> <b>lead</b> vocals are similar but backing vocals are different and some backing vocals are missing. [...] "Singring and the Glass Guitar" [...] is slightly different as the intro to Willie Wilcox' drum solo is missing. All other tracks on the album are indistinguishable from the final master.|$|E
40|$|Delayed {{differentiation}} or postponement {{is widely}} advocated to mitigate conflicts between product diversity and inventory cost savings. Manufacturers practicing postponement often suffer from severely constrained finishing capacities and noticeable <b>finishing</b> <b>lead</b> times. Therefore, inventories are still needed for finished products. Using {{the concept of}} inventory shortfall, this paper studies base-stock inventory models with and without demand forecasting and provides a computationally efficient method to set optimal inventory targets for finished products under capacitated postponement. Computations show inventory-saving benefit quickly vanishes after the capacity reaches a certain level. The value of forecasted advance-demand information (ADI) to postponement is justified, but can easily be overstated. Finishing capacities usually force manufacturers to build ahead according to demand forecast. When capacity limitation becomes severe, intuitions often guide producers to build to forecast even more than <b>finishing</b> <b>lead</b> times ahead. Results of this research indicate that these intuitions may be invalid and build to forecast more than <b>finishing</b> <b>lead</b> times ahead {{may not be a}} good practice. Further studies reveal that under capacitated postponement the forecasted advance-demand information is useful only when the variance of demand forecast errors is less than that of demands, and show that the optimal forecast lead time can be obtained {{in the same way as}} if the capacity is unlimited.

By the time it was <b>finished,</b> <b>lead</b> mining was in a deep downturn and, thanks to the Aberystwyth Improvement Company, the railway came to rely largely on the tourist industry, opening for passengers in December 1902.

Additionally, the band underwent {{a change in}} sound. During the aforementioned tour, Govaert had damaged her vocal cords and required surgery, after which the character of her voice changed. The band also went from a five-piece to a six-piece; guitarist Annelies Kuijsters had injured her hand during the tour {{and was unable to}} continue playing the guitar. The band decided she would continue by playing keyboards, and enlisted guitarist Thomas Holthuis to take the vacant guitar position.|$|R
50|$|Because of its {{location}} in the canal and railway networks, Newtown in Chester, along with Liverpool and Manchester, became a hub of northern English commerce. The canal was the 'motorway' of its day and narrowboats carried produce and supplies to and from North Wales (coal, slate, gypsum and <b>lead</b> ore). <b>Finished</b> <b>lead</b> (for roofing, water pipes and sewerage), produced in the huge leadworks in Egerton Street Newtown, was exported all over the country. Grain from the Cheshire farmlands was processed in the large mills and granaries {{on the banks of}} the canal at Newtown and Boughton; and salt (for preserving food such as fish and meat) came from Northwich.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn micro milling, {{which is}} mostly used in mold and die making, process {{reliability}} and predictability of tool failure are important. Particularly in precision and micro machining, tool breakage is hardly detectable and the requirements on accuracy are very high. Immersed tumbling {{is an appropriate}} process for the defined cutting edge preparation of micro milling tools. Its effects like increasing tool wear performance and tool life has been evaluated. In this paper, different cutting edge preparation processes showed that in cutting tests different effects occur regarding tool wear, process forces and surface quality.

500|$|Horses {{have been}} present and used in the Dales area from early times.

[...] The history of the modern Dales pony is strongly linked to the history of lead mining in the Dales area of England, which stretches from the Derbyshire peaks to the Scottish borders. [...] Lead has been mined in this area since Roman times, and Richard Scrope, then Chancellor of England, owned lead mines at Wensleydale in the 14th century.
