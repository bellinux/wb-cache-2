50|$|A special match-grade <b>go</b> <b>gauge</b> {{can also}} be {{employed}} to verify a particularly tight, or shorter-than-SAAMI spec. chamber length. Such gauges are usually specially ordered from chamber-reamer manufacturers. This minimizes case stretch or end-play in order to best control the positioning of an unfired round prior to its firing in a match-grade chamber. Such chambers are also usually cut to tighter dimensions in the case-neck area. Thus, a standard <b>go</b> <b>gauge</b> may not actually chamber as easily due to these reduced dimensions, {{even if they are}} cut properly.|$|E
50|$|A {{snap gage}} {{is a form}} of go/no <b>go</b> <b>gauge.</b> It is a limit gage with {{permanently}} or temporarily fixed measurement aperture(s) (gaps) which is used to quickly verify whether an outside dimension of a part matches a preset dimension or falls within predefined tolerances.|$|E
50|$|<b>Go</b> ring <b>gauges</b> {{provide a}} {{precision}} tool for production comparative gauging {{based on a}} fixed limit. <b>Go</b> <b>gauges</b> consist of a fixed limit gauge with a gauging limit based on the plus or minus tolerances of the inspected part. A <b>go</b> ring <b>gauge's</b> dimensions {{are based on the}} maximum OD tolerance of the round bar or part being <b>gauged.</b> A <b>go</b> plug <b>gauge's</b> dimensions are based on the minimum ID tolerance of the hole or part being <b>gauged.</b> The <b>go</b> plug (ID) <b>gauge</b> should be specified to a plus gaugemakers' tolerance from the minimum part tolerance. The <b>go</b> ring (OD) <b>gauge</b> should be specified to a minus gaugemakers' tolerance from the maximum part tolerance.|$|R

50|$|Go/no <b>go</b> <b>gauges</b> are {{encountered}} in {{all types of}} manufacturing. They may measure a physical dimension, e.g. (50 ±0.01mm), or a value such as {{the value of a}} resistor (100Ω (ohms) ±1%).A typical example is a plug gauge.|$|R
50|$|Thread class {{refers to}} the {{acceptable}} range of pitch diameter for any given thread. The pitch diameter is indicated as Dp in the figure shown above. There are several methods {{that are used to}} measure the pitch diameter. The most common method used in production is by way of a Go/no <b>go</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|E
50|$|Go/no-go gauges play an {{integral}} part in setting the correct headspace during gunsmithing. In order for the chamber to be in-spec, the bolt must close without resistance on the <b>go</b> <b>gauge,</b> but it must not close completely on the no-go gauge. In addition, there is usually a third gauge called FIELD that is slightly larger than the no-go gauge. Since bolt and chamber lugs eventually stretch with use, the bolt may start to close on the no-go gauge. If the bolt also closes fully on the field gauge, such a gun is considered unsafe due to high risk of shell case rupture if the cartridges length happens {{to be on the}} shorter end of the spec.|$|E
5000|$|The p-chart only {{accommodates}} [...] "pass"/"fail"-type inspection {{as determined}} {{by one or more}} go-no <b>go</b> <b>gauges</b> or tests, effectively applying the specifications to the data before they are plotted on the chart. Other types of control charts display the magnitude of the quality characteristic under study, making troubleshooting possible directly from those charts.|$|R
5000|$|There {{had already}} been {{a long history of}} {{increasing}} use of gauges up to this time, such as gauges for filing and go/no <b>go</b> <b>gauges,</b> which were custom-made individually in a toolroom for use on the shop floor; but there had never been super-precision gauge blocks that could be wrung together to make up different lengths, as Johansson now envisioned.|$|R
50|$|The Taft-Peirce Manufacturing Company was a {{pioneering}} sewing machine company established in 1875 at Woonsocket, Rhode Island, United States. As the sewing machine industry gradually commoditized, Taft-Peirce leveraged its toolmaking capabilities {{to become a}} supplier of gauges, such as various kinds of go/no <b>go</b> <b>gauges,</b> to the manufacturing industries, and a supplier of engineering and toolroom work on a contract basis. The company was dissolved on 6 October 1995.|$|R

40|$|Industrial {{inspection}} {{is one of}} {{the crucial}} tasks to ensure quality conformance of products. The inspection tasks can be done by using several methods like non-scaled go/not <b>go</b> <b>gauging,</b> measuring instruments, or advanced non-touching tools. In this research visual inspection using a developed optical system is conducted. One of the aims of this research is to design an on line visual inspection system that is capable to test geometrical quality characteristics of 2 -D machined products. The design process includes developing an economical optical system to acquire inspected product’s images. Image processing tools are utilized to deal with the product image; and extract features of its geometrical characteristics. A neural network-based methodology is developed and applied to decide whether the product conforms to pre-specified tolerances. The results of the developed methodology are compared to some statistics based visual approaches from the literature. The results show the goodness of the system as an automated visual inspection system and prove its superior performance with respect to other methods...|$|R

500|$|Boosting is an {{important}} part of Crash Nitro Karts gameplay. When the player boosts, their kart will momentarily go slightly faster than its normal top speed. Boosts are achieved by driving over boost pads scattered across the tracks, pumping the gas at the starting line, and holding the gas button at the right time when being reset on the track. Another technique used for boosting is the [...] "power slide". To execute a power slide, the player holds down one of the shoulder buttons to perform a hop and steer before the kart lands. While sliding, a curved [...] "boost gauge" [...] appears next to the player's kart. When the <b>gauge</b> <b>goes</b> from green to red, the player presses the opposite shoulder button to obtain a boost.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} noncommutative gauge theory is {{extended}} beyond the canonical case, i. e. to structures where the commutator {{no longer is}} a constant. In the first part noncommutative spaces created by star-products are studied. We are able to identify differential operators that still have an undeformed Leibniz rule and can therefore be gauged much {{in the same way}} as in the canonical case. By linking these derivations to frames (vielbeins) of a curved manifold, it is possible to formulate noncommutative gauge theories that admit nonconstant noncommutativity and <b>go</b> to <b>gauge</b> theory on curved spacetime in the commutative limit. We are also able to express the dependence of the noncommutative quantities on their corresponding commutative counterparts by using Seiberg-Witten maps. In the second part we study noncommutative gauge theory in the matrix theory approach. There, the noncommutative space is a finite dimensional matrix algebra (fuzzy space) which emerges as the ground state of a matrix action, the fluctuations around this ground state creating the gauge theory. This gauge theory is finite, <b>goes</b> to <b>gauge</b> theory on a 4 -dimensional manifold in the commutative limit and can also be used to regularize the noncommutative gauge theory of the canonical case. In particular, we are able to match parts of the known instanton sector of the canonical case with the instantons of the finite theory.

40|$|Canonically {{deformed}} spacetime, {{where the}} commutator of two coordinates is a constant, {{is the most}} commonly studied noncommutative space. Noncommutative gauge theories that have ordinary gauge theory as their commutative limit have been constructed there. But these theories have their drawbacks: First of all, constant noncommutativity can only be an approximation of a realistic theory, and therefore {{it is necessary to}} study more complicated space-dependent structures as well. Secondly, in the canonical case, the noncommutativity didn't fulfill the initial hope of curing the divergencies of quantum field theory. Therefore it is very desirable to understand noncommutative spaces that really admit finite QFTs. These two aspects of going beyond the canonical case will be the main focus of this thesis. They will be addressed within two different formalisms, each of which is especially suited for the purpose. In the first part noncommutative spaces created by star-products are studied. In the case of nonconstant noncommutativity, the ordinary derivatives possess a deformed Leibniz rule, i. e. d_i (f star g) ≠ d_i f star g + f star d_i g. Therefore we construct new objects that still have an undeformed Leibniz rule. These derivations of the star-product algebra can be gauged much {{in the same way as}} in the canonical case and lead to function-valued gauge fields. By linking the derivations to frames (vielbeins) of a curved manifold, it is possible to formulate noncommutative gauge theories that admit nonconstant noncommutativity and <b>go</b> to <b>gauge</b> theory on curved spacetime in the commutative limit. We are also able to express the dependence of the noncommutative quantities on their corresponding commutative counterparts by using Seiberg-Witten maps. In the second part we will study noncommutative gauge theory in the matrix theory approach. There, the noncommutative space is the ground state of a matrix action, the fluctuations around this ground state creating the gauge theory. In the canonical case the matrices used are infinite-dimensional (they are the Fock-space representation of the Heisenberg algebra), leading to a number of problems, especially with divergencies. Therefore we construct gauge theory using finite dimensional matrices (fuzzy spaces). This gauge theory is finite, <b>goes</b> to <b>gauge</b> theory on a 4 -dimensional manifold in the commutative limit and can also be used to regularize the noncommutative gauge theory of the canonical case. In particular, we are able to match parts of the known instanton sector of the canonical case with the instantons of the finite theory...|$|R

50|$|The first {{publication}} of the DPA, in 1890, was a short history of commoners’ rights on Dartmoor and the commons of Devon.

40|$|It was my {{intention}} to strain gauge Mk 5. 3 (4) {{to see the}} input and output relation-ship; the output to be measured between the secondary arm and the counter weight, as in a Veljko Milkovic pendulum in hammer mode (www. veljkomilkovic. com). Above: load cell on the solenoid pull rod Below: load cell in between secondary arm and counter weight (hammer) Then, with the pendulum working on 15 volts, and travel on the counter weight of around 45 mm … Load cell output is 1 volt per 20 pounds. In static mode, the 55 pound counter weight is suspended on the load cell. The DSO 101 (2) would read, on channel A, in red, at the 2. 55 volt mark or “VA 2 ”. Channel A’s zero mark is at the red A on the right, (level with the “Manual Trigger ” box). When in operation the counter weight (hammer) gains and loses about 20 pounds.
