The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration the object of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of <b>differentiation.</b> As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the <b>differentiation</b> against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E
