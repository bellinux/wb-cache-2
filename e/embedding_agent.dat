Durcupan subsequently proved to be miscible with the water-insoluble epoxy resin Araldite 2 which is commonly used for tissue embedding (2). In this way, animal tissues can be embedded in Araldite without being brought into contact with ethanol or acetone. By replacing Durcupan with Araldite as final embedding medium, ultrathin sections are more readily obtained than by employing Durcupan alone.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel <b>embedded</b> <b>agent</b> {{architecture}} {{that aims to}} coordinate a system of interacting <b>embedded</b> <b>agents</b> in real-world intelligent environments using a unique on-line multi-objective and multi-constraint genetic algorithm. The <b>embedded</b> <b>agents</b> can be complex ones such as mobile robots that would operate hierarchical fuzzy logic controllers or simple ones such as desk lamps that would bear threshold functions instead. The architecture would enable the agents to learn the users' desires and act in real time without the users having to repeatedly configure the system. The multi-embedded-agent system can adapt on-line to handle sudden changes such as unreliable sensors and actuators as well as agents that break down or come into the system.

Through orthogonal tests, optimal conditions of entrapping nitrifying bacteria {{by the two}} agents were determined by ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency. The properties of the two immobilized microbial beads produced under their optimum embedding conditions were compared. Results indicate that the optimum embedding conditions of calcium alginate beads (briefly CA beads) were 10 ml of nitrifying bacteria, 4 % of sodium alginate content, 3 mm in bead diameter and 24 -hr crosslinking time. The optimum embedding conditions of polyvinyl alcohol beads (briefly PVA beads) were 10 ml of nitrifying bacteria, 10 % of PVA content, 3 mm in bead diameter and 24 -hr crosslinking time.

No morphological alterations were seen during the latent period.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} a recently reported new bioadhesive {{system for the}} retrieval of small residual fragments (RFs) after intracorporeal lithotripsy, we systematically compared this system with coagulum lithotomy in retrograde intrarenal surgery. Materials and Methods: We extracted 30 human stone fragments (â¤ 1 mm) in an ex vivo porcine kidney model using a flexible ureteroscope for three groups: (1) the novel bioadhesive, (2) autologous blood as a natural adhesive, and (3) (control group) a conventional retrieval basket. Each group consisted of 15 test runs. Outcomes were evaluated regarding the macroscopic stone-free rate (SFR), retrieval time, and number of ureteral passages. Results: For groups 1 and 2, a significant advantage in stone clearance, mean retrieval time, and number of retrievals was detected compared to the control group (p = 0. 001). The time and number of retrievals were significantly lower in group 1 (10 : 36 minutes, p = 0. 001) than in group 2 (26 : 12 minutes, p = 0. 001), with shorter clotting time and better visibility. Conclusions: These data show the general feasibility of intrarenal RF embedding to improve the SFR.

40|$|One of {{the most}} active areas of {{research}} in arti¯cial intelligence is the study of learning methods by which agents " can improve performance while acting in complex dynamic environments. An agent, or decision maker, is embedded in an environment when it receives information from, and acts on, that environment in an ongoing closed-loop interaction. An <b>embedded</b> <b>agent</b> has to make decisions under time pressure and uncertainty and has to learn without the help of an ever-present knowledgeable teacher. Although the novelty of this emphasis may be inconspicuous to a biologist, animals being the prototypical <b>embedded</b> <b>agents,</b> this emphasis is a signi¯cant departure from the more traditional focus in arti¯cial intelligence on reasoning within circumscribed domains removed from the °ow of real-world events. One consequence of the <b>embedded</b> <b>agent</b> view is the increasing interest in the learning paradigm called reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike the more widely studied supervised learning systems, which learn from a set of examples of correct input/output behavior, RL systems adjust their behavior with the goal of maximizing the frequency and/or magnitude of the reinforcing events they encounter over time. While the core ideas of modern RL come from theories of animal classical and instru...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a novel intelligent <b>embedded</b> <b>agent</b> approach {{for reducing the}} number of associations and interconnections between various agents operating within ad hoc multiagent societies of an Ambient Intelligent Environment (AIE) {{in order to reduce the}} processing latency and overheads. The main goal of the proposed fuzzy-based intelligent <b>embedded</b> <b>agents</b> (F-IAS) includes learning the overall network configuration and adapting to the system functionality to personalize themselves to the user needs based on monitoring the user in a lifelong nonintrusive mode. In addition, the F-IAS agents aim to reduce the agent interconnections to the most relevant set of agents in order to reduce the processing overheads and thus implicitly improving the system overall efficiency. We employ <b>embedded</b> ambassador <b>agents,</b> namely embassadors, which are designated F-IAS agents utilized with additional novel characteristics to not only act as a gateway filtering the number of messages multicast across societies but also discover, recommend, and establish associations between agents residing in separate societies. In order to validate the efficiency of the proposed methods for multiagent and society-based intelligent association discovery and learning of F-IAS agents/embassadors we will present two sets of unique experiments. The first experiment describes the obtained results carried out within the intelligent Dormitory (iDorm) which is a real-world testbed for AIE research. Here we specifically demonstrate the utilization of the F-IAS agents and discuss that by optimizing the set of associations the agents increase efficiency and performance. The second set of experiments is based on emulating an iDorm-like large-scale multi-society-based AIE environment. The results illustrate how embassadors discover strongly correlated agent pairs and cause them to form associations so that relevant agents of separate societies can start interacting with each other. © 2010 ACM...|$|R
