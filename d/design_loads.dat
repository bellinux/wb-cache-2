5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof cladding and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as a testing ground for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E

40|$|Holdup in {{flighted}} rotary dryers can {{be classified}} according to its loading state as either over, under or at <b>design</b> <b>load.</b> The loading state influences the effectiveness of particle to gas heat and mass transfer {{as well as the}} residence time of solids through the dryer. As such, accurate estimation of the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> is critical to the analysis of performance and the optimal design of flighted rotary dryers. In this paper <b>design</b> <b>load</b> experiments carried out in a horizontal, pilot scale flighted rotary dryer at different experimental conditions are described. The <b>design</b> <b>load</b> experiments involved analysis of multiple photographs of the cross sectional area of the solids in {{the front end of the}} dryer, at increasing loading conditions. Subsequently, the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> was estimated using conventional criteria based on the saturation of material in the cascading or unloading flights. The study examined both free flowing and cohesive solids with cohesion being controlled through the addition of low volatility fluid to the solids (dynamic angle of repose ranged from 44. 7 ° to 62. 3 °). The effect of drum rotational speed was also examined (2. 5 rpm– 4. 5 rpm). In order to select an appropriate geometrically derived <b>design</b> <b>load</b> model, comparison with existing <b>design</b> <b>load</b> models from the literature was undertaken. The proportion of airborne to flight borne solids within the drum was characterised through a combination of photographic analysis coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. In particular, solid volume fractions of the airborne solids with solid flow rate ranging from 0. 703 kg/s to 0. 134 kg/s were characterised using a CFD technique based on the Eulerian–Eulerian approach. The suitability of using geometric models of flight unloading to predict <b>design</b> <b>loading</b> in flighted rotary dryers is discussed.

2500|$|There {{are many}} reasons that a {{geotechnical}} engineer would recommend a deep foundation over a shallow foundation, such as for a skyscraper. Some of the common reasons are very large <b>design</b> <b>loads,</b> a poor soil at shallow depth, or site constraints like property lines. There are different terms used to describe different types of deep foundations including the pile (which is analogous to a [...] ), the pier (which is analogous to a column), drilled shafts, and caissons. Piles are generally driven into the ground in situ; other deep foundations are typically put in place using excavation and drilling. The naming conventions may vary between engineering disciplines and firms. Deep foundations can be made out of timber, steel, reinforced concrete or prestressed concrete.|$|E

A $1.5 billion program, known as H-Mod, to re-wing the 76 completed C-5As to restore full payload capability and service life began in 1976. After design and testing of the new wing design, the C-5As received their new wings from 1980 to 1987. During 1976, numerous cracks were also found in the fuselage along the upper fuselage on the centerline, aft of the refueling port, extending back to the wing. The cracks required a redesign to the hydraulic system for the visor, the front cargo entry point.|$|E

40|$|The common {{wisdom is}} to design {{cladding}} and components using {{a lower level}} wind load than the main structural frames, i. e. a shorter recurrence period wind load is used for cladding design than for frame design. This paper first discusses the <b>design</b> wind <b>load</b> levels for structural frames and for cladding and components. Next, the <b>design</b> wind <b>loads</b> of scaffolds for building construction, those of buildings in the construction stage, and those of so-called “temporary” structures such as site offices are discussed. In Japan, the <b>design</b> wind <b>load</b> for scaffolds is defined as 1 -year-recurrence wind load, because its average setting period at one construction site is around 6 months, but this paper clearly proves the inappropriateness of this <b>design</b> wind <b>load</b> estimation concept. Then, it is shown {{that there is no}} relation between the <b>design</b> wind <b>load</b> level and its lifetime at an individual site. Finally, even for the <b>design</b> wind <b>load</b> for main structural frames, it is clearly demonstrated that the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> level {{may not be able to}} be determined based on the lifetime of an individual building. Therefore, although the LCC concept is applied in <b>design</b> <b>load</b> estimation, it is strongly recommended that the optimal <b>design</b> <b>load</b> level should be decided considering total LCC for the city or nation as a whole, and treat design as involving a group of buildings, rather than attempting to optimize the LCC of individual buildings. Clearly, the cost associated with social or national security must be included...|$|R

Since April 1 st 2010, the basic standard in Europe for the determination of the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> for road bridges is the European Standard – Eurocode 1 (2003). The work of Calgaro et al. (2010) specifies in detail standard loads. Work on the Standard started in 1987, but road traffic research in several European countries had already been conducted since 1977. It should be noted that almost 40 years have passed since the research was completed. Over the period road traffic had changed substantially (OECD (2011)).

30|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to investigate a}} possible relationship between the accelerated pavement deterioration rates and pavement design strength using a two-stage design analysis approach. The deployed approach applies a two-stage solution to the three popular design methods of flexible pavement to yield pavement <b>designs</b> using stage <b>load</b> applications values specified for each investigated <b>design</b> <b>load</b> applications level. The resulting two-stage pavement designs are then used to obtain an indicator called the stage design strength ratio (percentage) defined as {{the ratio of the}} relative strength change to the design relative strength. The relative strength change is the difference between the design relative strength associated with a <b>design</b> <b>load</b> applications level and stage relative strength associated with a stage load applications value that is {{less than or equal to}} the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> applications level. It basically provides a measure of strength difference resulting from two pavement designs obtained using two distinct loading conditions. Then, the derived values of stage design strength ratio are compared to the deployed stage load applications values.|$|R
