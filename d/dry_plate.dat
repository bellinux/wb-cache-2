5|$|Prior to enclosure, Low Fell was {{predominantly}} {{inhabited by}} {{a small number of}} tinkers and hawkers but after enclosure the character of the suburb changed rapidly as people moved to be close to the new turnpike road. Although neighbouring Sheriff Hill thrived through an influx of heavy industry, built upon a colliery and pottery particularly, by 1827 new allotment owners on Low Fell had spent heavily to improve land so that sod cottages were a rarity and the last remaining pit heaps had been removed. The result was that numerous wealthy individuals were drawn to the area and it was this influx which helped shape and grow the early settlement, as opposed to the more usual means of growth allied to work and industry. The 1880s were a decade of considerable building in the village, fueled by the completion of a tramway with nearby Gateshead in 1883 and this brought some light industry to the area; in the same year Mawson & Swan built their <b>dry</b> <b>plate</b> works in Kells Lane and this proved to be the first of several light industries to locate in that area. These smaller industries, allied to several farms in the Dryden Road area of the village (Dryden Farm, Orchard Cottage Dairy Farm and Derwent Crook Farm all survived in this area until the Second World War), generated a small economy in an area where inhabitants had built and settled predominantly to escape the dirt and grime of industrial Tyneside.|$|E

Although his formal {{education}} extended only to eighth grade, his early interest in mechanics and inventions was evident at his first job at the Eastman <b>Dry</b> <b>Plate</b> and Film Company (later Eastman Kodak Company) in Rochester, New York. He invented a stencil machine adopted at the plant and later built a rudimentary camera to study photography.|$|E
25|$|In the March 1851 {{issue of}} The Chemist, Frederick Scott Archer {{published}} his wet plate collodion process. It {{became the most}} widely used photographic medium until the gelatin <b>dry</b> <b>plate,</b> introduced in the 1870s, eventually replaced it. There are three subsets to the collodion process; the Ambrotype (a positive image on glass), the Ferrotype or Tintype (a positive image on metal) and the glass negative, which was used to make positive prints on albumen or salted paper.|$|E
25|$|The first airbrush, {{depending}} on the definition, was patented in 1876 (Patent Number 182,389) by Francis Edgar Stanley of Newton, Massachusetts. This worked akin to a diffuser / atomiser {{and did not have}} a continuous air supply. Stanley and his twin brother later invented a process for continuously coating photographic plates (Stanley <b>Dry</b> <b>Plate</b> Company) but are perhaps best known for their Stanley Steamer. No artistic images that used this 'paint distributor / atomiser' exist or are as yet known.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{methods used}} to {{quantify}} microsclerotia of Verticillium dahliae in soil are reviewed. Most quantification methods are soil-type dependent, but are useful for disease prediction within certain soils. The major factor determining the accuracy of <b>dry</b> <b>plating</b> methods {{is the amount of}} soil plated per Petri dish. Wet plating methods are less sensitive to higher amounts of soil, especially when the fraction smaller than 20 mum is removed by wet sieving. Despite general assumptions, wet plating methods do not have lower detection limits than <b>dry</b> <b>plating</b> methods. <b>Dry</b> <b>plating</b> methods are less variable at higher inoculum levels, but more variable at low inoculum levels. Bioassays are helpful tools in answering specific research questions, but are not convenient for large scale use. Molecular quantification techniques are promising, because they are not hampered by antagonistic effects, but data on their disease predictive abilities are still largely lacking. Suggestions are given for a better comparison of techniques, and some original results are presented to illustrate certain arguments...|$|R
500|$|All Tigers were {{fitted with}} a single Ford twin-choke carburettor. The {{compression}} ratio of the larger Mark II engine was increased from the 8.8:1 of the smaller block to 9.3:1. Other differences between the versions included upgraded valve springs (the 260 had developed a reputation for self-destructing if pushed beyond 5000rpm), an engine-oil cooler, an alternator instead of a dynamo, a larger single <b>dry</b> <b>plate</b> hydraulically operated clutch, wider ratio transmission, and some rear-axle modifications. There were also cosmetic changes: speed stripes instead of chrome strips {{down the side of}} the car, a modified radiator grille, and removal of the headlamp cowls. All Tigers were fitted with the same [...] wide steel disc bolt-on wheels as the Alpine IV, and Dunlop RS5 [...] cross-ply tyres. The lack of space in the Tiger's engine bay causes a few maintenance problems; the left bank of spark plugs is only accessible through a hole in the bulkhead for instance, normally sealed with a rubber bung, and the oil filter had to be relocated from the lower left on the block to a higher position on the right-hand side, behind the generator.|$|E

2500|$|George Norman Barnard (1819–1902) {{was born}} in Coventry, Connecticut, and as a child moved to upstate New York. After a brief career in hotel management, he opened a {{daguerreotype}} studio in Oswego, New York, becoming nationally known for his portraits. It is not known where Barnard learned his trade. On July 5, 1853, Barnard photographed the conflagration at the Ames flour mills in Oswego, producing {{what may be the}} first American [...] "news" [...] photograph. In 1854 he moved his operation to Syracuse, New York, and began using the wet-plate collodion process. In 1859, Barnard joined Edward Anthony's firm. At the outbreak of war, Barnard was working for Mathew Brady in Washington D.C. and New York City. Barnard, besides doing portraits and photographing the troops around Washington D.C., was among Brady's initial corps of photographers, who were sent into the field to photograph the battlefields of Northern Virginia, and the Peninsula, including Bull Run and Yorktown, as well as Harper's Ferry. Barnard {{is best known for his}} 1866 [...] masterpiece, Photographic Views of Sherman's Campaign, which contains 61 Imperial size, albumen prints embracing scenes from the occupation of Nashville, the great battles around Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain, the campaign of Atlanta, the Great March to the Sea, and the Great Raid through the Carolinas. He continued to photograph after the war, operating studios in Charleston, S.C. and Chicago. His Chicago studio was destroyed by the historic fire of 1871. In 1880 Barnard sold his Charleston studio and moved to Rochester, New York. From 1881 to 1883 he was the distinguished spokesman for George Eastman's line gelatine dry plates. Barnard ventured into his own short lived <b>dry</b> <b>plate</b> manufacturing concern with Robert H. Furman in 1862. In 1864, the Barnards moved to Painesville, Ohio and opened a studio which utilized their own manufactured dry plates. In 1888, George closed his business and his family moved to Gadsden, Alabama. In 1892, he moved for the last time to Cedarville, near Syracuse, New York, where he maintained his interest in photography, taking pictures of friends and family, and taking yearly class pictures of the school children. George Barnard died in 1902 at the age of 82.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} the camera can be traced much further back than the {{introduction}} of photography.

6000|$|The {{argument}} which I would advance is this. If {{a strong}} materialisation medium can throw out {{a cloud of}} stuff which is actually visible, may not a medium of a less pronounced type throw out a similar cloud with analogous properties which is not opaque enough {{to be seen by}} the average eye, but can make an impression both on the <b>dry</b> <b>plate</b> in the camera and on the clairvoyant faculty? If that be so--and it would not seem to be a very far-fetched proposition--we have at once an explanation both of psychic photographs and of the visions of the clairvoyant seer. When I say an explanation, I mean of its superficial method of formation, and not of the forces at work behind, which remain no less a mystery even when we accept Dr. Geley's statement that they are [...] "ideoplastic." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>plate,</b> {{also known}} as gelatin process, is an {{improved}} type of photographic plate. It was invented by Dr. Richard L.
