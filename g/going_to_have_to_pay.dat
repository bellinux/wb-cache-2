25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

40|$|In late 2006, {{shortly before}} the end of his tenure as {{secretary}} of defense, Donald Rumsfeld made the following remark regarding the ongoing U. S. role in Iraq: “The biggest mistake would be not to pass things over to the Iraqis. It’s their country. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> govern it. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> provide security for it.
