3000|$|Cunny “cunt”, spelled {{variously}} and retained in modern cunnilingus, derives from Latin cunnus, probably as a euphemism. There {{may also have}} been some input from French con itself derived from Latin cunnus and used for the bawdy-part from (at least) the fourteenth century (cf. Boch and von Wartburg 1975; Picoche 1979), and perhaps from Spanish coño, too. Coney /kʌni/ was the word for “rabbit” until the late nineteenth century, when it dropped out of use because of the taboo homonym. In Latin, rabbit is cuniculus, and its burrow cuniculum; <b>end-clip</b> either and you are left with cuni[e] ({{spelled variously}} as coney, cony, conny, conye, conie, connie, conni, cuny, cunny, cunnie [...]...|$|E
3000|$|When {{underpants}} {{are referred}} as pants it is a fore-clipping, and when as undies {{it is an}} <b>end-clipping.</b> 3 Clippings imply what Recanati (2002) calls ‘unarticulated constituents’.’Od’s life and ’sblood are fore-clipped as is the archaic nation ⇐ damnation (Grose et al. 1811). Gee is <b>end-clipped</b> God or Jesus and jeeze from the latter; bra is <b>end-clipped</b> brassiere and pee ⇐ piss. Clipping {{is a form of}} contraction often referred to as ‘abbreviation’. Both acronyms and alphabetisms are constructed from the initial letters of phrases but acronyms differ from alphabetisms by being pronounced like words rather than a list of letters. Thus snafu /ˈsnɑfu/ is an acronym for “Situation Normal, All Fucked (euphemistically, ‘Fouled’) Up”. On the other hand S.O.B. /ˈɛs oʊ bi/ is an alphabetism for “Son-Of-A-Bitch”; RTFM is an alphabetism for “Read The Fucking Manual”. The spoken forms of both Gee and pee could be classed as alphabetisms of single words because of their homophony with letters G and P, but they are also end-clippings, and their written forms make them look more like acronyms! So Gee and pee fall into three categories, of which the least controversial is <b>end-clipping.</b> (The fact that Gee and pee fall into three categories is not a source for analytical despair: the three categories support one another to deliver meaning).|$|R
3000|$|Both {{cauliflower}} {{and cabbage}} are euphemisms for genitalia. The flaccid penis is a tail (the term penis is Latin for “tail”), a tassel, bauble, putz (this word {{is much less}} dysphemistic in English than in Yiddish; it derives from the verb putsn “adorn”) It is a dangle, worm, schlong, tummy / hairy banana (cf. Bahasa Malaysia pisang “banana”, {{said to be the}} prevalent euphemism used among women), noodle, dill, gherkin, wally, wire, wiener and other terms for sausages (little boys sport saveloys). One delightful metaphor is the one eyed trouser snake. Cock—which, in this sense, has multiple sources—comes in part from the “tap, faucet” sense of cock (still present in stopcock and ballcock) (see Allan and Burridge 1991 : 105 ff); doodle derives from cock via fore and <b>end-clipped</b> cockadoodledoo but also perhaps from doodle as adornment. The bird metaphor sanctions pecker. It is found in Catullus (85 – 54 bce) Passer, deliciae meae puellae “sparrow, my girl’s darling” (Carmina II, Catullus 1969) and throughout the centuries since. Used literally, cock is the generic term for a “male bird”; however, its salient literal meaning is “the male of gallus domesticus”; and this cock, by repute, rules the roost—whence rooster. This used to be what a man was expected to do (a view which probably had some effect on the use of Cock as a euphemistic remodelling of God in fifteenth–seventeenth century English). Taking this perspective, for a man to be cock of the walk demonstrates the very essence of manhood. From a different point of view, the manifestation of maleness is having a penis. From the Middle Ages until at least the seventeenth century, the flesh and blood of a cock was believed to be a strong therapeutic and restorative agent and was recommended in medical texts and recipes. Thirdly, there is the folk myth that men often find themselves sexually aroused at cock-crow (hence the wake-up call Wakey, wakey, hands off snakey), whereas their womenfolk are more readily sexually aroused in the evening. Because the penis rises with the cock (rooster), an association is established between the two. Fourthly, the rooster is a randy creature which struts around with a neck that moves not unlike an erect penis on a walking man, whence one source for the idiom keep your pecker up. Pecker is a frequent euphemism for penis. A pecker was also a narrow hoe used for digging holes when seeding; perhaps it got the name from the birdlike action involved in its use, and the association with seed. Certainly, peckers, seed, and birds form a natural set which intersects with another natural set whose members are peckers, penises, seed, and holes. Beak {{is one of the many}} synonyms for “penis” (Farmer and Henley 1890 – 1904). The similarity of the profiled penis-with-testicles to the outline of a bird gives rise to an image found in many languages, cf. the Bahasa Malaysia and Bahasa Indonesia euphemism burung “bird” (used particularly by women); Italian uccello “bird” and passerotto “sparrow”, Latin passer “sparrow’; and the German verb vögeln “fuck” is apparently based on Vogel “bird” (Barolsky 1978; de Jongh 1968 / 1969). The guy who said he was in prison ‘not for robbing a wagon but for wagging his robin’ was immediately understood (Mike Harding ‘Strangeways Hotel’ (Rubber Records, 1975). One of the appearance-based terms for the female pudendum is bird’s nest. The penis is the bird to enter this nest. Mark Twain wrote an imaginary conversation, (20), in mock Elizabethan English between Queen Elizabeth I, Lady Helen (aged 15), Lady Alice (aged 70) and Francis Beaumont (aged 16): [...]...|$|R
