5|$|The {{final version}} of the script was {{distributed}} to the cast, but Patrick Stewart did not receive a copy. Berman was concerned that if anyone <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> it, they would call Stewart to complain and it would appear as though Stewart was being left out because he had criticized the story. LeVar Burton called Stewart to praise the script. Stewart was sent a copy and requested a meeting to discuss changes. Piller feared the worst, but after a twenty-minute meeting with Stewart, who requested several dialogue changes, the script was finalized. During pre-production, the marketing department wanted to decide a title, preferring Star Trek: Revolution. Alan Spencera friend of Pillersuggested Insurrection, which was selected from a choice of Insurrection, Rebellion, High Treason and Act of Treason.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the short}} line to Chesham {{generally}} {{had a good}} safety record, despite its sharp curves and relatively steep gradient, it suffered two significant accidents in this period. On 19August 1909 the Aclass engine hauling the 7.53am train from Chesham broke an axle and derailed outside Chesham. There were no injuries but the track was blocked; a passenger service was maintained by operating shuttle services from {{each end of the}} branch to the crash site, where passengers were obliged to walk around the derailed engine to change trains. On 6November 1909 a backdraught from a locomotive firebox enveloped Robert Prior, the train's driver, in flames. (The type of locomotive is not recorded, but it is likely to have been a Metropolitan Railway D Class, which are known to have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> backdraughts.) The locomotive's fireman managed to drive the train to Chesham, where Prior died from his injuries two days later. An inquest found that Prior had failed to turn on the blower, and a verdict of accidental death was recorded.|$|E

5|$|Black {{began the}} 1946 Cleveland Indians {{season as a}} member of the roster, looking to get playing time in an {{established}} starting rotation. His season began inauspiciously when he was hit on the chin with a ball, causing him to miss a week during spring training. The 1946 season marked the first time that Black did not finish on the major league roster. After pitching in 18 games for the Indians, he was sent to the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. While with the Brewers, Black failed to win any games, and at one point was suspended after he disappeared during a road trip. At the conclusion of the season, Indians owner Bill Veeck had a talk with Black, who admitted he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> drunkenness. He agreed to spend the winter with Alcoholics Anonymous with Veek's help, and by the time the 1947 Cleveland Indians season began, Black was sober.|$|E
5|$|Bräck {{closed the}} gap with de Ferran over the next fifteen laps as they moved towards slower cars. Bräck got a run on de Ferran and overtook him {{at the bottom of}} the first turn to take over the lead on lap 46, while Andretti lost fourth place to Franchitti on the same lap. Jourdain spun leaving turn four because of his car {{generating}} oversteer, and slid down the frontstretch triggering the second caution on the 50th lap. Franchitti drove to the outside of the track in avoidance. Castroneves avoided hitting Jourdain's car, which remained {{at the bottom of the}} first turn and, though his vehicle lost one of its shock covers, he regained control of his car and continued. Fittipaldi reported to his team that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> either his gearbox or drivetrain and drove slowly into the pit lane on lap 53 becoming the race's second retirement. The leaders elected to make pit stops on the same lap under caution. Da Matta gained the most positions, moving from sixth to third, and Bräck remained the leader at the lap-57 restart. Bräck pulled away from the rest of the field, until de Ferran {{closed the gap}} between them by the start of the 80th lap.|$|E

Welty, the chief shift nurse on duty that night, who had overheard most of the conversation from the nearby nurses' station, corroborated Churchill's version. She further recalled that Perkins-Graham had said she had only one reservation about transferring to obstetrics—Waters. Churchill, Welty testified, had actually defended Waters, saying she had a difficult job and was sometimes moody, but that could be accommodated.|$|E

25|$|Asus {{was founded}} in Taipei in 1989 by T.H. Tung, Ted Hsu, Wayne Hsieh and M.T. Liao, all four having {{previously}} worked at Acer as hardware engineers. At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the computer-hardware business. Intel Corporation would supply any new processors to more established companies like IBM first, and Taiwanese companies {{would have to wait}} for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering prototypes. According to the legend, the company created a prototype for a motherboard using an Intel 486, but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> their motherboard. Asus solved Intel's problem {{and it turned out that}} Asus' own motherboard worked correctly without the need for further modification. Since then, Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its competitors.|$|E
25|$|The other {{lead that}} was {{discarded}} {{was one that}} suggested that Tobares was kidnapped for ransom, mainly because his possible abductors have not reached out to his family for a payment. They kept an eye for any activity on Tobares' bank accounts {{to see if they}} were used after he went missing. Investigators analyzed his latest activity on social media as well. His last activity was on Facebook, where Tobares made a profile picture change on May 28, a few days before he went missing. Investigators believe that Tobares was probably hired as a cook by a drug lord for a party or event without him knowing who he was cooking for. At some point, investigators alleged, Tobares might have seen something suspicious that put him in danger, or might have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> someone at those private events. In addition, investigators concluded that Tobares might have been a victim of gang retaliation. They allege that rival gang members might have kidnapped Tobares {{to send a message to}} his employers.|$|E
25|$|During flight testing, the snag on {{the leading}} edge of the stabilators was filled in, and the gap between the leading-edge {{extensions}} (LEX) and the fuselage mostly filled in. The gaps, called the boundary layer air discharge (BLAD) slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of parasitic drag, worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to bleed air from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme Structural loads, resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers. This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect. F/A-18s of early versions <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads.|$|E
