50|$|Charles Boney {{testified against}} <b>David</b> <b>Camm</b> {{for the first}} time, accusing him of luring him out to the home before {{shooting}} his own family and then turning the gun on him.|$|E
50|$|<b>David</b> Ray <b>Camm</b> (born March 23, 1964) is {{a former}} state trooper who was acquitted and {{released}} in 2013 after his third trial on charges of murdering his wife, Kimberly, and children, Brad, 7, and Jill, 5, at their Georgetown, Indiana home on September 28, 2000. He had been found guilty in two earlier trials, but these verdicts were overturned on appeal. Camm {{now works as a}} case coordinator for a non-profit wrongful conviction advocacy organization called Investigating Innocence that provides criminal defense investigations for inmates.|$|R
5000|$|Evidence of {{misconduct}} regarding the blood spatter was uncovered {{when in the}} third trial, crime scene photographer Rob Stites testified for the defense, admitting he had perjured himself {{in the first two}} trials. Stites' assertion that the spots on <b>David</b> <b>Camm's</b> shirt were HVIS was the cornerstone of the probable cause affidavit that led to Camm's arrest and his testimony at the first two trials helped the prosecution win Camm's convictions. He had previously testified that he was an expert blood spatter pattern analyst and a professor at Portland State University who {{was in the process of}} attaining a Ph.D. — credentials which were fabrications. He asserts that Floyd County prosecutor Stan Faith helped create those fraudulent credentials. During the third trial, he outlined how he was sent to the crime scene by Rod Englert to photograph and take notes. Despite having no formal training in the field nor any work experience as a crime scene analyst, his notes ended up being used in the probable cause affidavit with him being listed as a [...] "crime scene reconstructionist", a title that did not apply to him. The defense pointed out several aspects of Stites' notes that were later proven to be false including [...] "HVIS" [...] on the garage door, later proven to be a petroleum based-product and not blood. Stites' opinion that there was a clean up at the crime scene involving bleach was also incorrect. The confusion came from the unfamiliar look of the blood after the serum had separated from the blood cells. Regarding his actions, he commented, [...] "It was a dumb thing...In hindsight, I would have kept my mouth shut." [...] Stites was not charged with perjury for his testimony in the previous two trials.|$|R
50|$|As {{a junior}} curler, Squires and his St. Thomas Curling Club rink of Jason <b>Camm,</b> <b>David</b> Easter and Curtis Easter won the 2013 Pepsi Ontario Junior Curling Championships. The team then {{represented}} Ontario at the 2013 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, where they posted a 7-3 record before losing a tie-breaker match to Manitoba's Matt Dunstone rink. Later in the year, Squires {{was added to}} the Jake Higgs rink at the 2013 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials Qualifying Tournament as an alternate.|$|R
50|$|<b>David</b> <b>Camm</b> {{is facing}} a civil suit filed by his late wife's parents over the {{estimated}} $625,000 Camm is set to collect from life insurance and Kim Camm's 401K fund. Frank and Janice Renn steadfastly maintain their belief in Camm's guilt.|$|E
50|$|<b>David</b> <b>Camm</b> {{was tried}} twice {{and sentenced to}} life in prison for the murder of his wife and two children. He was acquitted upon retrial in 2013. DNA found at the scene linked Charles Boney to the murders. Boney is serving 225 years in prison for the murders.|$|E
50|$|The Vortek water-wall {{plasma arc}} lamp, invented in 1975 by <b>David</b> <b>Camm</b> and Roy Nodwell at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, made the Guinness Book of World Records in 1986 and 1993 {{as the most}} {{powerful}} continuously burning light source at over 300 kW or 1.2 million candle power.|$|E
5000|$|Touch DNA was {{introduced}} in the third trial of <b>David</b> <b>Camm</b> by the defense. The DNA profile of another man, Charles Boney, was found on a number of objects at the crime scene, including the panties of Camm's wife Kim and a fingernail that is thought to have broken off during the struggle. The DNA evidence aided in his acquittal of the murders.|$|E
50|$|Later on {{the morning}} of January 11, 1992, two {{brothers}} from Canaan, Indiana, were driving toward Jefferson Proving Ground to go hunting when they noticed a body {{on the side of the}} road. They called the police at 10:55 a.m. and were asked to return to the corpse. <b>David</b> <b>Camm,</b> who was later acquitted of his own family's murders, was one of the responding officers. Jefferson County Sheriff Buck Shippley and detectives began an investigation, collecting forensic evidence at the scene. They initially suspected a drug deal gone wrong and did not believe the crime had been committed by locals.|$|E
5000|$|One of the organization’s most {{prominent}} cases was the exoneration of <b>David</b> <b>Camm,</b> a former Indiana state trooper who was wrongfully {{convicted of the}} murders {{of his wife and}} two children. Approximately five years after he was arrested, DNA evidence identified a convicted felon named Charles Boney as having been at the crime scene. Boney is currently serving 225 years for the murders. After his release, Camm was hired as a case coordinator for Investigating Innocence. His first case for the organization was Darlie Routier, who was convicted of the murders of her two sons in 1997.|$|E
5000|$|Boney gave {{a number}} of {{conflicting}} confessions before he finally settled on {{one in which he}} was lured to the Camm residence under the guise of selling a gun to <b>David</b> <b>Camm.</b> He admits to placing the shoes on the vehicle, but claims he did it only coincidentally and not related to his foot fetish. Boney claims that Sept 28 he arrived at 7 pm to meet David at the Camm residence to sell him a weapon—a meeting they arranged through chance meetings and without the use of a telephone. He hands Camm the weapon wrapped in his gray sweatshirt that was later found at the crime scene. Within seconds, Kim arrives home in her Bronco, Camm follows the Bronco into the garage and Boney hears three shots fired. Boney alleges that Camm then attempted to shoot him and stated [...] "you did this". He claims that the gun either jammed or ran out of bullets. With Camm holding a now non-functioning weapon, Boney ran after Camm, chasing him back into the garage. Camm entered the house while Boney tripped and fell over Kim's shoes, which were off of her feet and on the garage floor. Boney stated that he picked up the shoes and placed them atop the Bronco. He then leaned against the vehicle to look at Brad and Jill, who were inside the vehicle, deceased. He explains that this is why his hand print was found on the vehicle.(note: based on testimony from other prosecution witnesses, Kim, Brad, and Jill were still alive and at the pool until 7:15pm. The timeline given by Boney of a shooting shortly after 7pm also conflicts with the prosecution's timeline, which aligns with the medical examiner's estimation of an 8pm time of death.)Aside from Boney's story, no additional evidence has been recovered to connect <b>David</b> <b>Camm</b> and Charles Boney.|$|E
50|$|Lead defense {{attorney}} Richard Kammen accused police of feeding Boney a false story designed to implicate Camm and coercing him {{to testify against}} Camm by playing on his fear of racial prejudice within {{the criminal justice system}} by telling him that a black man accused of killing a white family would get the death penalty if he didn't cooperate. During interrogations, he was reminded on several occasions of the likelihood of getting the death penalty {{on the basis of his}} race and that the best way to avoid the death penalty was to testify against <b>David</b> <b>Camm.</b> The defense cited a suspicious series of undocumented and unrecorded phone calls—33 in all—between Boney and the Floyd County Prosecutor's office in the two-week span between his DNA being identified and his arrest.|$|E
5000|$|Further complicating matters was the {{testimony}} of Rob Stites. Stites testified for the prosecution {{that he was an}} expert blood spatter analyst. It was later uncovered that he had no training and his credentials were fabrications by the prosecutor. His testimony that the blood on Camm's shirt was high velocity impact spatter aided in the conviction of <b>David</b> <b>Camm.</b> Dr. Shaler pointed out that one limitation of blood spatter analysis testimony is that [...] "you do not have the supporting underlying science" [...] to back up your conclusions. When Stites testified, the jury {{had no way of knowing}} that he was not the expert that he purported to be. Even among the expert witnesses, it is unknown which set of experts interpreted the stains accurately as there is no objective way of determining which bloodstain pattern analyst has applied the science correctly.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{criminal}} case against <b>David</b> <b>Camm,</b> who was tried three times {{for the murder of}} his family largely on the basis of blood spatter evidence, both prosecution and the defense used expert bloodstain pattern analysts to interpret the source of the approximately 8 drops of blood on his shirt. The prosecution's experts included Tom Bevel and Rod Englert, who testified that the stains were high velocity impact spatter. Paul Kish, Barton Epstein, Paulette Sutton, Barrie Goetz and Stuart H. James testified for the defense that the stains were transferred from his shirt brushing against his daughter's hair. Dr. Robert Shaler, Founding Director of the Penn State Forensic Science Program, decried blood spatter analysis as unreliable in the Camm case. [...] "The problem in this case is the number of stains are minimal," [...] he said. [...] "I think you're really on the edge of reliability." [...] All of the blood spatter analysts involved in the case are [...] "experts" [...] in the traditional sense. The problem is [...] "We have two opinions in this case. That, in essence, is a 50 percent error rate." [...] An unacceptable level of reliability in a court case when the perception of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is what is required.|$|E
5000|$|The public {{reaction}} to the verdict has been mixed. Many Louisville and Southern Indiana residents who lived through the extensive media coverage were surprised by the not guilty verdict in the third trial. In {{reaction to the}} verdict, a local resident stated [...] "A {{lot of people are}} — just like I am — completely shocked, {{and a lot of people}} think that he should not be out." [...] Nationally, the Camm case has garnered a lot of attention from wrongful conviction advocacy groups who believe that the previous convictions were miscarriages of justice. Bill Lamb, President and General Manager of WDRB, the Fox affiliate in Louisville, Kentucky, issued a public apology to <b>David</b> <b>Camm</b> stating: [...] "Seven years ago, I did a Point of View criticizing David Camm's attorneys for seeking yet another appeal right after his second conviction for the murder of his family. I wondered when Indiana taxpayers would get to stop paying fortunes in trial expenses, and why any accused killer could possibly deserve so many 'do-overs'. Well, now we have the answer: When they're not guilty." [...] After the third trial, a juror, in response to the question [...] "Do you think that they intentionally wanted to convict an innocent man?" [...] responded [...] "I would hope not but…I sense that the State Police had a hard time admitting that they had made a mistake." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} legal experts {{have criticized the}} way the case was handled. Thomas Schornhorst, a {{professor}} emeritus of the Indiana University School of Law, said the case has been overturned repeatedly because they have pushed the envelope with other evidence fearing {{that they would not}} get a conviction on bloodstain evidence alone. Law professor Shawn Boyne highlighted the Camm trials {{as an example of the}} problems within the American justice system. Boyne stated that the judges in these trials allowed the prosecutors to present [...] "specious claims of motive designed to paint the defendant with a broad stroke of guilt and moral condemnation and overcome a lack of physical evidence." [...] Boyne stated [...] "the state overreached and that overreaching did not serve the cause of justice." [...] Louisville defense attorney Steve Romines criticized the prosecution's decision to change the theory of the crime numerous times instead of dropping the charges: [...] "The problem is, in the first trial, David Camm's the shooter and acted alone. The second trial, David Camm's the shooter and Boney aided and abetted him. And now in this trial, Charles Boney is the shooter and <b>David</b> <b>Camm</b> aided and abetted him. In three trials, with the same proof, they've had three different theories", adding [...] "Proof doesn't change. If you have proof beyond a reasonable doubt, you argue the same thing throughout. You don't have to constantly shift your theory to fit your proof." ...|$|E
