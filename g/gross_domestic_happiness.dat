40|$|The human {{dimension}} of sustainability – {{the balance of}} planet, people, and prosperity concerns – importantly includes wellbeing that is the means {{to the end of}} happiness. This paper explores what we think that we know about happiness, possible roles of urban planning in fostering happiness, and how environmental features can be enhanced by planning and so contribute to the happiness of a city’s residents and visitors. Recent developments in positive psychology provide a basis for this inquiry, and are reviewed. A focus of this paper is on The Happiness Initiative in Seattle, Washington. This recent non-governmental program, begun by Sustainable Seattle, is inspired by the earlier effort in Bhutan to replace or augment Gross Domestic Product with measurement and attention to the <b>Gross</b> <b>Domestic</b> <b>Happiness.</b> Finally, the paper will explore how findings from research on factors contributing to happiness can be applied in urban planning.

Vector Error Correction Method and co-integration techniques are used for analyzing the relationship between <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> product (GDP), <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> savings (GDS) and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> investment (GDI) in this study. The Johansen co-integration test indicates <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> product (GDP), <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> savings (GDS) and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> investment (GDI) are co-integrated, and that a long-run equilibrium exists between them.

In doing so, we distinguish between <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> saving and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> private saving. We posit that <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> private saving rather than <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> saving is more important in determining GDP. We find that both <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> saving and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> private saving are cointegrated with GDP. However, causality tests between the growth of <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> saving/the growth of private domestic saving and the growth of GDP indicate that the causality does not run in any direction. ...|$|R

The study employs the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to test for cointegration and Error correction based Granger causality analysis for exploring the causality between the variables. Empirical results show that there exist cointegration between <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> savings, investment and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> product when each of these is taken as dependent variable. Granger causality analysis shows that there exists short-run bidirectional causality between investment and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> product as well as between <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> savings and investment. Nevertheless, no short-run causality is found between <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> savings and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> product.

The results of Johansens's cointegration test indicated that there exist a long run and short run relationship among real <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> product, foreign direct investment, exports, imports and foreign direct investment in Ghana. The study found out that in the long run, exports had a positive effect on real <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> product and as a result, an increase in exports leads to an improvement in real <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> product. Imports and foreign direct investment had a negative effect on real <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> product, respectively.

This study looks at <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> saving in South Africa in general and the trends of its {{components}} in particular. It addresses the impacts of internal and external policies on the disaggregated domestic saving in South Africa. This is done with the aim of establishing the channels through which these policies influence the components of South Africa’s domestic saving. This study focuses on current economic literature while examining <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> saving and its attributes. A brief discussion of <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> saving on emerging market region puts sub-Saharan Africa’s <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> saving, particularly that of South Africa, into perspective. Hence, the developments in South Africa’s domestic saving are compared with those of some selected countries. An analysis of <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> saving in South Africa for the period 1970 to 2004 indicates a long-run downward pattern. The disaggregated domestic saving in South Africa shows that although three components contributed to the decline in South Africa’s domestic saving, the public sector appeared to be the main culprit in the decline. Thus, the net saving by the government had been negative since early 1980. The study observes that the patterns of saving of the three components are influenced by both internal and external factors. iv These internal and external factors are made up of fiscal and monetary policies, and the balance of payments. Without over-emphasising the importance of <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> saving in any economy, it is crucial for South Africa to encourage a positive saving culture for improvement in meaningful domestic investment for long-term economic growth. This study, therefore, suggests that in a developing economy like the South African economy, a positive saving attitude could be encouraged through the use of internal and external policies. Hence, the positive impact of internal and external factors could motivate all stakeholders in <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> saving to seize any available opportunity to boost their savings, thereby raising South Africa’s <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> saving...|$|R
