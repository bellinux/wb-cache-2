We find the allocation <b>of</b> emissions <b>allowances</b> is significantly more important to distributional outcomes than the initial costs or regional variation of costs. Older households—age 65 and older—incur relatively less cost than other age groups due to automatic inflation indexing of Social Security. Lowincome households spend a larger fraction of earnings on energy than wealthier households; however, the distribution <b>of</b> <b>allowance</b> value and indexing of government programs offset this spending.
