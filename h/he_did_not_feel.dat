5|$|His {{comeback}} to the County Championship {{continued with}} a 44-ball half-century against Middlesex on 19 April 2007, while in May {{he hit a}} career-best 284 against Northamptonshire, although Trescothick stated then that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> ready for an international Test match position. Trescothick followed this double century with a knock of 76 off 35 balls against Northamptonshire, with five fours and seven sixes.|$|E
5|$|In summer 2006, Say Anything toured with Dashboard Confessional; Ben Lee {{was with}} the tour in the US, while John Ralston joined the tour in Canada. The band was asked {{to be a part}} of the Warped Tour 2006, but instead opted for the Dashboard tour. Bemis later made {{statements}} implying <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> he was emotionally ready for a Warped Tour.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{after the}} game's release, Sonic Team member and Sonic and the Black Knight {{director}} Tetsu Katano remarked that although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> the Werehog concept was a mistake, {{time and resources}} were a limiting factor in the game's production. He also remarked that the Werehog may reappear in future games, or possibly in a sequel to Sonic Unleashed, should one be made.|$|E

5|$|Brandon later {{returned}} to active service, commanding his regiment through the Battle of Gettysburg. General William Barksdale {{was killed in}} the battle; Colonel Humphreys became brigadier general to replace him, and Brandon was in turn promoted to colonel. He went on to see action in the Chickamauga Campaign. In September 1863, after the Battle of Chickamauga, Brandon resigned from active duty. Because of his artificial leg, age and the recurrence of an ailment from 1862, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> fit for military service at the time.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1020s, Maymandi urged Mahmud to invade Jibal, {{which was then}} {{under the control of}} the young Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla. However, the real ruler of the region was Majd al-Dawla's mother Sayyida Shirin, which was already known by the neighbors of the Buyids, {{including}} the Ghaznavids. Mahmud, however, did not agree with him, because <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> his empire threatened because of a woman ruling in the region.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversial}} Peace Prize {{was that}} awarded to Barack Obama in 2009. Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President of the United States, {{but the actual}} evaluation occurred over the next eight months. Obama himself stated that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> deserving of the award, or worthy of the company it would place him in. Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1877, PedroII paid a {{visit to}} Caxias and ascertained that he could no longer remain in office. The entire cabinet {{resigned}} on 1 January 1878. His health problems had become so troubling that he had been asking repeatedly to resign since early 1876. Caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health, but increasingly felt a sense of alienation. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> he could play a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an older generation who perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as essential for holding the nation together.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director {{and told them}} {{that he did not want}} to audition because <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate SÃ¶ze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E
5|$|Chaitanya Krishna {{confirmed}} his {{inclusion in the}} cast {{by the end of}} March 2014. In late April 2014, Naresh was chosen {{to play an important role}} in the film, which he later described as one of the best roles of his career. Roshan Basheer was selected to reprise the role of Varun, the son of the Inspector General of Police, in the remake. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that he was being typecast and he accepted the role, adding that it is not often that a Malayalam actor gets a chance to act in the Telugu films.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, Breckinridge's wife Ann died. Lingering {{sadness and}} {{memories}} of his and Ann's life in Baltimore may have led {{him to leave the}} city and the pastorate he had held for twelve years. He was offered pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky, but instead, accepted the presidency of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1845 against the advice of his brothers John and William. A rift between Breckinridge and his brother Cabell's widow and other relatives may help account for this surprising decision. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> he could yet return to his home state.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2010 Walton filmed {{her final}} scenes for the series, {{along with two}} fellow cast members Scare and Gerard McCarthy (who plays Kris Fisher). She spoke of her upset over leaving her fellow cast members, but later said she {{was looking forward to}} {{pursuing}} other projects. Walton also confirmed that she was happy the door was left open for a potential return, stating that she would consider reprising her role as Loretta in the future. Walton also said she understood why Marquess axed her character, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> Loretta had anywhere left to go after the cancellation of her main storyline. However, she also felt like she deserved another chance to prove herself.|$|E
5|$|When Dean {{returned}} to the United States, he received a hero's welcome and was presented {{with a number of}} decorations, including the Medal of Honor, which he was unaware he had been awarded. Dean maintained he did not think his own experience was particularly heroic and asserted <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> he deserved an award for his actions in Korea. He was given a ticker-tape parade in New York City on his return to the US on October 26, 1953, and he was made the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade on January 1, 1954.|$|E
50|$|As the Vicodin effect {{begins to}} wear off on Taub and Foreman, Foreman reveals {{he knew about}} the {{employee}} records, and had come down to remove an offense in his own records before it becomes digitized. Taub reads Foreman's files and discovers a minor offense from during his college years. Taub surmises that Foreman offends on purpose as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> like <b>he</b> deserves to be among elite doctors. Foreman reads Taub's records that indicate a stellar early career, something Taub also wants to hide, as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> his career has lived up to his early potential. Foreman leaves the room, deciding not to shred the record containing the offense. After Foreman exits, Taub shreds the record of the offense and replaces the file.|$|R
60|$|Now he is safe at last; {{hidden from}} all living things--hidden it may be, from God; {{for at least}} God is hidden from him. He has desired to be alone: and he is alone; {{the centre of the}} {{universe}}, if universe there be. All created things, suns and planets, seem to revolve round him, and he a point of darkness, not of light. He seems to float self-poised in the centre of the boundless nothing, upon an ell-broad slab of stone-- and yet not even on that: for the very ground on which <b>he</b> stands <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel.</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> the mist which wets his cheek, the blood which throbs within his veins. He only is; and there is none beside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord Silverbridge {{presents}} his compliments to Mr. Jawstock, and begs to {{say that}} <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> himself called upon to express any opinion as to Major Tifto's conduct at Doncaster." [...] That was the first. The second was rather less simple, but not much longer.|$|R
5|$|Caxias {{was growing}} old, and was ill and {{exhausted}} {{by the time he}} reached AsunciÃ³n. As <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> up to the task of pursuing LÃ³pez into the Paraguayan hinterland, he asked to be either relieved of his post or given a short leave. Although his request was denied, he appointed a senior member of his staff as acting commander, and left for Brazil on 19 January 1869. The Emperor was angered that the marquis had left his post without permission, and especially that Caxias had declared the war to have been already wonâeven though LÃ³pez was still at large and regrouping his few remaining military assets. Caxias' ill-conceived decision seriously endangered the hard-won achievements of the past months, even as the objective of eliminating LÃ³pez as a threat remained tantalizingly within reach.|$|E
5|$|Desertion was {{a problem}} for the 24th Infantry; the 25th Infantry Division had to detain 116 deserters from the 24th Infantry during August, {{compared}} to 15 from the 27th Infantry and 12 from the 35th Infantry. In late August, Kean began investigating the unit's behavior, including its poor performance at the battle of Sangju several weeks earlier, and found its performance was affecting other units of the division. After the 24th's performance at the battles of Battle Mountain and Haman, Kean suggested to Walker that the regiment be disbanded and its troops be used as replacements for other units in the field. Virtually all of the officers and enlisted men in the regiment were supportive of this idea, but Walker declined, feeling he could not afford to lose a regiment. Even if his other units were reinforced, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> they could be extended to cover the entire line.|$|E
5|$|Fischer and Cristina {{often did}} outdoor {{activities}} together, but Fischer's stepmother {{thought they were}} only friends. She said that she never saw them hold hands or behave {{in a way that}} suggested intimacy. According to his friends, Fischer went with Cristina to South Padre Island, Texas, during spring break and had sex with her in her parents' condominium. They said that he did not brag about it, and in fact seemed to regret his decision. Cristina denied this ever happened. Later that year they attended St. Joe's prom together. In June 1992, Fischer broke up with Cristina; he told one of his friends that their relationship was only physical, and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> an emotional attachment to her. Fischer had given Cristina his ring while they were dating, and once they broke up he asked her to return it. Cristina refused.|$|E

50|$|In 1996, a {{white man}} from West Columbia, South Carolina, drove his van into the Redneck Shop as a protest against the store's racism. Kennedy said that he later told the man that, while <b>he</b> {{obviously}} <b>does</b> <b>not</b> agree with Howard's views, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that violence is an appropriate response.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, the hermit is {{identified}} for a robot (because <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> the humans' pain), is thoroughly beaten and tortured, then shot into outer space via a cannon. He then lands near Trurl's house, where the story began. Concluding his tale, the hermit assures Trurl that his thirst for altruism has vanished.|$|R
5|$|In September 2003, the NCAA {{reversed}} {{its decision}} to add a second year of postseason ineligibility after hearing an appeal by the University; the Wolverines {{went on to become}} champions of the 2004 National Invitation Tournament. Also in September 2003, Judge Edmunds deferred sentencing until she could monitor Webber's service of 300 hours of community service at a middle-school literacy program for two summers that she ordered. Also in September the University announced it sought $695,000 in restitution from Webber. Webber was the only involved athlete that the University sought restitution from in part because {{he was the only one}} who confessed to lying to a grand jury. Webber stated that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> the University's request was appropriate because he had not stolen from the University.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season with the Black Hawks, 1934â35, Morenz played in all 48 games for the team, scoring 8 goals and 34 points, an {{improvement}} over the previous season. The Black Hawks reached the playoffs, though Morenz was held pointless in the two games played. The following season was not as good for Morenz. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> comfortable in Chicago, and was being benched, playing fewer minutes than he was used to. After 23 games with the Black Hawks, in which he scored 15 points, Morenz was traded {{for the second time}} in his career; he was sent to the New York Rangers on January 26, 1936, for forward Glen Brydson. Playing 19 games for the Rangers, Morenz scored 2 goals and had another 4 assists for 6 points, giving him 21 points over the season.|$|E
5|$|Zombi 2 {{serves as}} a sequel to Zombi, a re-edited Italian release of George A. Romero's 1978 film Dawn of the Dead; Zombi had been edited by Dario Argento and given a new score by the Italian band Goblin, and proved {{successful}} upon its release in Italy. As Italian copyright law allows any film to be marketed as a sequel to another work, the film was quickly greenlit and financed by producer Fabrizio De Angelis. Enzo G. Castellari was offered to direct Zombi 2, but turned it down as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> {{he would be the}} right director for a horror film. Director Lucio Fulci was De Angelis' second choice for the project, and was hired based on his handling of violent scenes in his previous films Sette note in nero and Non si sevizia un paperino.|$|E
