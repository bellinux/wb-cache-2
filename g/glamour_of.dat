25|$|In {{the history}} of French music, Les Troyens stands out as a grand opera that avoided the shallow <b>glamour</b> <b>of</b> Meyerbeer and Halévy, but {{therefore}} paid the price of long neglect. In our own time the opera has finally come {{to be seen as}} one of the greatest operas of the 19th century. There are several recordings of the work, and it is performed with increasing frequency.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that with their emphasis on the younger, attractive and charismatic characters, Neighbours and Home and Away have found success in the middle ground between glamorous, fantastic U.S. soaps with their wealthy but tragic heroes and the more grim, naturalistic UK soap operas populated by older, unglamorous characters. The casts of Neighbours and Home and Away are predominantly younger and more attractive than the casts of UK soaps, and without excessive wealth and <b>glamour</b> <b>of</b> the U.S. daytime serial, a middle-ground in which they have found their lucrative niche.|$|E

500|$|Euston's 1960s {{style of}} {{architecture}} {{has been described}} as [...] "a dingy, grey, horizontal nothingness" [...] and a reflection of [...] "the tawdry <b>glamour</b> <b>of</b> its time", entirely lacking in [...] "the sense of occasion, of adventure, that the great Victorian termini gave to the traveller". Writing in The Times, Richard Morrison stated that [...] "even by the bleak standards of Sixties architecture, Euston is one of the nastiest concrete boxes in London ... The design should never have left the drawing-board". Michael Palin, explorer and travel writer, in his contribution to Great Railway Journeys titled [...] "Confessions of a Trainspotter", likened it to [...] "a great bath, full of smooth, slippery surfaces where people can be sloshed about efficiently".|$|E

500|$|As {{with another}} Prabhupada-inspired track {{that he wrote}} during this period, [...] "Living in the Material World", Harrison expresses his belief that the pursuit of fame and riches – {{particularly}} {{in the music industry}} – is meaningless. In the second verse of [...] "The Lord Loves the One", he sings: [...] "We all fool around, with objectives in mind / To become rich or famous, with our reputations signed..." [...] While author Joshua Greene compares Harrison's songs from this period to Vedic sutras, Allison specifies this verse-two message to a passage from the Katha Upanishad, which reads: [...] "Intoxicated, deluded by the <b>glamour</b> <b>of</b> riches, the childish do not see that they must pass away. They think, 'This is the world and there is no other.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The drama Bus Stop was {{the first}} film that Monroe chose to make under the new contract; the movie was {{released}} in August 1956. She played Chérie, a saloon singer whose dreams of stardom are complicated by a naïve cowboy {{who falls in love}} with her. For the role, she learnt an Ozark accent, chose costumes and make-up that lacked the <b>glamour</b> <b>of</b> her earlier films, and provided deliberately mediocre singing and dancing. Broadway director Joshua Logan agreed to direct, despite initially doubting her acting abilities and knowing of her reputation for being difficult. The filming took place in Idaho and Arizona in early 1956, with Monroe [...] "technically in charge" [...] as the head of MMP, occasionally making decisions on cinematography and with Logan adapting to her chronic lateness and perfectionism.|$|E

[...] The tour's HBO special, The Velvet Rope: Live in Madison Square Garden, garnered more than fifteen million viewers. It surpassed the ratings of all four major networks among viewers subscribed to the channel. The concert won an Emmy Award from {{a total of four}} nominations.

The Birmingham Sports Argus described how [...] "if Peter's role [...] has denied him the <b>glamour</b> <b>of</b> a glorious achievement in action, he has his share of personal glamour. He's a tall fair-haired good looker, and so comely, that he was described as the film star of Highfield Road. Is single too."

500|$|In 1981, music {{magazine}} the NME {{described the}} album as darker and more passionate than 1980's Crocodiles. The Record Mirror {{also said that}} the band sang the blues and devoted themselves to existential sadness. They went on to note that the album offered [...] "an anatomy of melancholy, resplendent with the <b>glamour</b> <b>of</b> doom". Melody Maker disagreed when in 1981 they said [...] "the Bunnymen are continuing to play majestic, uplifting music that will shine through the dark days ahead of us". In the 2002 book Turquoise Days: The Weird World of Echo & the Bunnymen, author Chris Adams said that in 1995 McCulloch had said, [...] "That spikey edge [...] still stands up." [...] In relation to their style of music, in 1980 McCulloch had said, [...] "I always say 'We're a rock band'. Because I'm proud of that."

500|$|The {{season was}} not without controversy, however. There {{are a number of}} episodes with scenes of one {{teenager}} being beaten by his father. When reviewing those episodes, the Ryerson University of Toronto said the show [...] "stands on its own" [...] in reflecting [...] "the kinds of issues [...] facing in their own lives ... handled with care and consideration, without all the <b>glamour</b> <b>of</b> a Hollywood soap opera." [...] A two-part storyline about date-rape proved too risqué for The N officials, who delayed its broadcasting until suitable edits could be made, and other special treatments were available in the form of panel discussions, online parental guides and separately filmed introductions. The Gazette said, [...] "You've got to hand it to the creative team behind CTV's justly celebrated teen series, Degrassi: The Next Generation. They're nothing if not a clever bunch", and Brian Orloff of the St. Petersburg Times praised the series as it [...] "stays in touch with teens' lives".|$|E
