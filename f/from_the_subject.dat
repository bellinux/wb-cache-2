5|$|Mayan {{languages}} are ergative in their alignment. This {{means that the}} subject of an intransitive verb is treated similarly to the object of a transitive verb, but differently <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of a transitive verb.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subordinate}} clause the subject, if different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of main clause, sometimes {{has to take}} accusative or genitive case. There is marginal occurrence of subjects taking ablative case as well. Subjects of attributive clauses in which the head has a function (as {{is the case for}} all English relative clauses) usually require that if the subject is not the head, then it take the genitive, e.g. tüünij idsen hool that.one- eat- meal 'the meal that s/he had eaten'.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence of The Wind Will Carry Us. From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical {{relationship between}} image and sound. The camera moves from long shots of the Land Rover winding {{its way through the}} mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film’s protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Aquinas {{argued that}} {{statements}} about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an analogy {{is in some ways}} the same and in some ways different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, {{it does not mean that}} God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.|$|E
25|$|The {{subjects}} {{believed that}} for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual shocks. In reality, {{there were no}} shocks. After the confederate was separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electroshock generator, which played prerecorded sounds for each shock level. After a number of voltage-level increases, the actor started to bang on the wall that separated him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> After several times banging {{on the wall and}} complaining about his heart condition, all responses by the learner would cease.|$|E
25|$|Besides the {{absolute}} accidents {{there is also}} the relative accident, relation.

25|$|In linguistics, wh-phrases are {{operators}} binding variables at LF, {{like other}} quantifier noun phrases.

25|$|Many {{inscriptions}} {{consist of}} only a few words (often names) in rote phrases, and many are fragmentary.

25|$|There is a {{connection}} between Dejection and Frost at Midnight in everything but its form. This is primarily true of the original version, {{but many of the}} personal elements of the poem continue over into the published version. The trimming of the poem allows for Coleridge to emphasize the most important poetic aspects of the original and to create a separation of the form <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> area which allows for a strong incongruity not in the original.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} the game came to Ian Messiter as he rode {{on the top of}} a number 13 bus. He {{recalled}} Percival Parry Jones, a history master from his days at Sherborne School who, upon seeing the young Messiter daydreaming in a class, instructed him to repeat everything he had said in the previous minute without hesitation or repetition. To this, Messiter added a rule disallowing players from deviating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> as well as a scoring system based on panellists' challenges.|$|E
25|$|After {{determining}} {{that the subject}} is cooperative, the reader will make a number of probing statements or questions, typically using variations of the methods noted below. The subject will then reveal further information with their replies (whether verbal or non-verbal) and the cold reader can continue from there, pursuing promising lines of inquiry and quickly abandoning or avoiding unproductive ones. In general, while revelations seem {{to come from the}} reader, most of the facts and statements come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> which are then refined and restated by the reader so as to reinforce the idea that the reader got something correct.|$|E

25|$|The title L'Oiseau bleu (The Blue Bird) can {{be traced}} back to a French {{literary}} fairy tale by Madame d'Aulnoy (1650/1651 – 4 January 1705), published in 1697. When d'Aulnoy termed her works contes de fées (fairy tales), she originated the term that is now generally used for the genre. Prince Charming, in the story, is transformed by the fairy godmother into a blue bird. Aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of the title of Madame d'Aulnoy's story, there is further iconographic evidence in Metzinger's painting that suggests a link between the two. The first relates to the woman gazing into a mirror on the left side of Metzinger's painting.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnification}} of {{the detail}} also varies with focal length; {{for a given}} detail, {{the ratio of the}} blur disk diameter to imaged size of the detail is independent of focal length, depending only on the detail size and its distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> This ratio can be useful when {{it is important that the}} background be recognizable (as usually is the case in evidence or surveillance photography), or unrecognizable (as might be the case for a pictorial photographer using selective focus to isolate the subject from a distracting background). As a general rule, an object is recognizable if the blur disk diameter is one-tenth to one-fifth the size of the object or smaller (Williams 1990, 205), and unrecognizable when the blur disk diameter is the object size or greater.|$|E
25|$|After Lazarus {{had checked}} her gun {{and come to}} the {{interrogation}} room, they explained that this was really about some loose ends they were trying to tie up in the Rasmussen case, since her name had come up in the investigation. They claimed they wanted a private setting because while Ruetten was an old boyfriend, she was long married to someone else and did not want her private life to become the subject of office gossip. Stearns and Jaramillo knew they would have to tread carefully since Lazarus herself was well aware of police interview techniques and her rights to silence and legal counsel, which she could invoke at any time. They rambled and digressed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> at times, sometimes discussing unrelated police business, but eventually came back to Rasmussen. Lazarus claimed to recall little due to the intervening years, but gradually revealed more and more knowledge—including oblique acknowledgements of her visits to the Ruetten condo—until she accused her colleagues of considering her a suspect, whereupon they allowed that there was DNA evidence connecting her to the crime scene and she was free to go. She left the room and was immediately arrested and charged with the murder.|$|E

25|$|The ruling stratum, {{like that}} of the later Činggisids within the Golden Horde, was a {{relatively}} small group that differed ethnically and linguistically from its subject peoples. This is thought to have been the Alano-As and Oğuric Turkic tribes, who were numerically superior within Khazaria. The Khazar Qağans, while taking wives and concubines <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> populations, were protected by a Khwârazmian guard corps, or comitatus, called the Ursiyya. But unlike many other local polities, they hired soldiers (mercenaries) (the junûd murtazîqa in al-Mas'ûdî). At the peak of their empire, the Khazars ran a centralised fiscal administration, with a standing army of some 7–12,000 men, which could, at need, be multiplied two or three times that number by inducting reserves from their nobles' retinues. Other figures for the permanent standing army indicate that it numbered as many as one hundred thousand. They controlled and exacted tribute from 25–30 different nations and tribes inhabiting the vast territories between the Caucasus, the Aral Sea, the Ural Mountains, and the Ukrainian steppes. Khazar armies were led by the Qağan Bek (pronounced as Kagan Bek) and commanded by subordinate officers known as tarkhans. When the bek sent out a body of troops, they would not retreat under any circumstances. If they were defeated, every one who returned was killed.|$|E
