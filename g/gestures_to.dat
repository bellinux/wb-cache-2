During the Microsoft Press Conference at E3 2011, Ryse was announced as a Kinect-only title. The announcement entailed a prerendered trailer with minor gameplay footage. The gameplay footage featured players using their own body <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> control the protagonist to fight against enemies, and perform actions like sword wielding, blocking attacks with a shield, and head-butting. The trailer served as a test for Crytek {{to see whether the}} general audience liked the Kinect features or not.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Ryan Key {{lying on his}} bed in an apartment. Suddenly, he gets {{swallowed}} by the bedsheets (this is where the track starts to play). The scene then shifts to Key in another dimension, ending {{up next to the}} wife of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away from the man. Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a window, where he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> offer him a drink, when Key notices he is in a bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Władysław still {{tried to}} take {{a leading role in}} European politics, and {{negotiate}} a peaceful settlement to the Thirty Years' War, a settlement which he hoped would ease his way into regaining the Swedish crown. Following the armistice of Stuhmsdorf, Władysław came to increasingly realize that his prospects for regaining the Swedish throne were dim. In the years 1636–1638 he proposed several reforms to strengthen his and his dynasty's power in the Commonwealth. His first plan was an attempt to secure a hereditary province within the country, which would not be threatened by the possible power shift following a future royal election; this, however, did not gain sufficient support in the Sejm. Next, Władysław attempted to create an order of chivalry, similar to the Order of the Golden Fleece, but this plan was scuttled down as well, with the szlachta and the magnates seeing this as an attempt to create a royal, loyalist elite, and traditionally opposing anything that could lead to the reduction of their extensive power. Popular vote and opposition also resulted in the failure of the plan to raise taxes from trade tariffs; here it was not only the nobility but even the merchants and burghers from towns, like Gdańsk (Danzig) who were able to muster enough support (including from foreign powers) to stop the king's reforms. In fact, the defeat of his plans was so total, that he was forced to make certain conciliatory <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> the nobility, as the Sejm passed several laws constraining his authority (such as to hire foreign troops), further indicating the limits of royal power in the Commonwealth.|$|E

30|$|All of {{the lessons}} made {{connections}} between equations and graphs in speech; the lessons varied only in which representations the teacher referred <b>to</b> using <b>gestures.</b> We varied whether the teacher referred to the equations in gestures (or not), and whether the teacher referred to the graphs in gesture (or not), yielding four conditions: teacher <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> both equations and graphs, teacher <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> equations only, teacher <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> graphs only, and teacher <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> neither equations nor graphs. To assess learning, we developed assessment items that required students to understand connections among representations – that is, to generate a graph given an equation and/or a story, or to generate an equation given a graph and/or a story. We evaluated students’ success at representing both slope and intercept in the equations and graphs that they constructed. We hypothesized {{that there would be}} beneficial effects of referring to the equations in gestures, as well as beneficial effects of referring to the graphs in gestures. Moreover, we expected that these effects would be additive, such that <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> both representations would be better than <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> one representation only. We also considered the possibility that these effects might be interactive, with the combination leading to enhanced performance above and beyond the added effects of <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> each representation on its own. Thus, we predicted that students would show the greatest learning in the condition in which the teacher referred to both the equations and the graphs with gestures and speech.|$|R

25|$|According to Givens (1999), {{the process}} of nonverbal {{communication}} or negotiation is to send and receive messages {{in an attempt to}} gain someone’s approval or love. Courtship, which may lead to love, is defined as a nonverbal message designed to attract sexual partners. During courtship, we exchange nonverbal communication <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> tell each other to come nearer and nearer until we touch. Essential signals in the path to intimacy include facial nuzzles, kissing and caressing each other.|$|E

25|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to advance methods of {{improvisation}} and active listening, proposing live audio soundscapes that mesh canine sounds with electroacoustic practice. In {{the process of developing}} this performance, a custom built theremin, that incorporates a rug as an interface, was created to allow Tom to use scratch and digging <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> create sound, accompanied by a diverse range of vocalization. These studio performances are audio recorded for use later in the live performance where they are remixed into a new experimental improvisational soundscape. Andreyev accompanies Tom's vocals and rhythms with her own live theremin and software performance.|$|E

He is also known to be verbally aggressive towards batsmen. This behaviour came back to bite him during India's First Test on their 2006 tour of South Africa, when he verbally admonished Sreesanth, an Indian bowler, after Sreesanth had trouble evading a delivery targeted at his upper-body. Nel gestured to his heart, indicating that he felt Sreesanth lacked courage. Nel's next delivery was hit for a six over long off by Sreesanth who broke into a wild dance after the shot, clearly mocking Nel.|$|E

25|$|McMahon {{made his}} first {{on-screen}} appearance in two years on an episode of SmackDown! before WrestleMania XIX, watching his father's training in the gym to prepare his match against Hulk Hogan.

He turned face once more {{in the summer of}} 2003 {{for the first time since}} early 2001 by getting involved in a feud with Eric Bischoff, who had made improper remarks and <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> Shane's mother Linda. He defeated Bischoff in a Street Fight at SummerSlam. McMahon also got involved in a bitter rivalry with Kane after Kane gave Linda a Tombstone Piledriver because she did not name him the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship.
