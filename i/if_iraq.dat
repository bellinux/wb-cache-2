5|$|Biographer Lanny Ebenstein noted a drift {{over time}} in Friedman's views from an interventionist to a more {{cautious}} foreign policy. He supported US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a hard line against Communism, but moderated over time. However Friedman did state in a 1995 interview {{that he is an}} anti-interventionist. He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the USA's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War, but that it might be improved <b>if</b> <b>Iraq</b> were to become a peaceful and independent country.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{needed to}} find a vehicle to {{continue}} to contain Saddam because the CIA said {{all we have to}} do is wait six months and Saddam is going to collapse on his own volition. That vehicle is sanctions. They needed a justification; the justification was disarmament. They drafted a Chapter 7 resolution of the United Nations Security Council calling for the disarmament of Iraq and saying in Paragraph 14 that <b>if</b> <b>Iraq</b> complies, sanctions will be lifted. Within months of this resolution being passed—and the United States drafted and voted in favor of this resolution—within months, the President, George Herbert Walker Bush, and his Secretary of State, James Baker, are saying publicly, not privately, publicly that even <b>if</b> <b>Iraq</b> complies with its obligation to disarm, economic sanctions will be maintained until which time Saddam Hussein is removed from power.|$|E

However, before the ship could arrive in the Middle East, the war ended. Restigouche was then redirected to the Atlantic where she deployed as part of NATO's Standing Naval Force Atlantic, the first west coast-based ship to do so.

2500|$|During the inquiry, British {{ambassador}} David Broucher {{reported a}} conversation with Kelly at a Geneva meeting in February 2003.

Broucher had asked Kelly what would happen <b>if</b> <b>Iraq</b> were invaded, and Kelly had replied, [...] "I will probably be found dead in the woods." [...] Broucher then quoted from an email he had sent just after Kelly's death: [...] "I did not think much of this at the time, taking it to be a hint that the Iraqis might try to take revenge against him, something that did not seem at all fanciful then. I now see that he may have been thinking on rather different lines." [...] According to an entry in one of Kelly's diaries, discovered afterwards by his daughter Rachel at his home, this meeting did not take place in February 2003, but in February 2002. According to Kelly's half-sister, Sarah Pape, the day after his daughter Ellen's wedding on Saturday 22 February 2003, he flew to New York. Pape told the inquiry, [...] "he certainly did not mention he was going to be flying almost straight back to visit Geneva." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 9, the Defense Intelligence Agency {{received}} {{information from}} a source considered reliable, predicting that [...] "the situation is presently more critical than previously reported" [...] and postulating a 50% chance Iraq would invade Iran. An April 11 CIA analysis is more blunt: [...] "Evidence indicates that Iraq had probably planned to initiate a major military move against Iran {{with the aim of}} toppling the Khomeini regime"—and had [...] "sought to engage the Kuwaitis to act as intermediary in obtaining United States approval and support for Iraqi military action against Iran." [...] Carter himself has confirmed that fear the U.S. hostages would be executed <b>if</b> <b>Iraq</b> attacked was one reason he approved a failed rescue mission on April 24. In light of these alerts, the claims of senior Carter administration officials involved with Iran—including White, Naas, Precht, and head of the National Security Council (NSC)'s Iran desk Gary Sick—that they were surprised by the invasion require some explanation. In all likelihood, these warnings went unheeded because [...] "those who doubted they amounted to compelling evidence won the argument. In effect, they were right. Only in early July did U.S. observers note the movement of Iraqi assets out of garrison with war-related 'basic loads' of ammunition" [...] and it was not until September 17 that the CIA indicated [...] "the intensification of border clashes between Iran and Iraq has reached a point where a serious conflict is now a distinct possibility." [...] Even then, as recounted by State Department official W. Nathaniel Howell, U.S. officials remained unsure what to make of Saddam's intentions: [...] "We all followed Saddam's actions and rhetoric closely but most people I knew tended to believe he was posturing." [...] When the invasion came on September 22, [...] "it was unclear whether Saddam had simply fallen into a rage following a smaller skirmish." [...] White recalled: [...] "The outbreak of war did, in fact, {{come as a surprise to}} most of us because a decent portion of Iraq's ground forces were still in garrison. The hasty movement of the remaining units up to the front immediately after the beginning of major hostilities was the activity that tended to nudge me toward the abrupt scenario in which Saddam ordered the attack before all military preparations had been completed." [...] Thus, in the view of Chris Emery, [...] "it is unlikely that the United States was ever in possession of clear evidence of Saddam's intention to invade Iran. Although the Carter administration drastically underestimated the scale of Saddam's plans, the disorganized and apparently impetuous nature of the invasion, with much of the Iraqi army still in garrison, and occurring in the context of border skirmishes and aggressive propaganda, muddied the waters for U.S. observers." ...|$|E
