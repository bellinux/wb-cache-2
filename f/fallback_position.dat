5|$|Although no {{documentary}} {{account of}} Gibraltar {{is available for}} the period following the Madinat al-Fath project, {{there are reasons to}} believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of Tarifa in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that Sancho would lay siege to Algeciras (it did not eventually happen) in order to sever the most direct links of the Marinids with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have led to the establishment of a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would have protected the rearguard of Algeciras and provide a <b>fallback</b> <b>position</b> should Algeciras have fallen. At the same time, and with the increased presence of the Christian fleets in the Straits, Gibraltar provided an excellent lookout post.|$|E
25|$|The team, surmising {{that they}} would likely be compromised, retreated to a <b>fallback</b> <b>position.</b> Within an hour, the SEAL Reconnaissance and Surveillance team was {{attacked}} by Shah and his men who were armed with RPK light machine guns, AK-47s, RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenades, and 82mm mortars. The intensity of the incoming fire, combined {{with the type of}} attack, forced the SEAL team into the northeast gulch of Sawtalo Sar, on the Shuryek Valley side of Sawtalo Sar. The SEALs made a number of attempts to contact their combat operations center with a multi-band radio and then with a satellite phone. The team could not establish consistent communication, other than for a period long enough to indicate that they were under attack. Three of the four team members were killed, and the only survivor, Marcus Luttrell, was left unconscious with a number of fractures and other serious wounds. He regained consciousness and was rescued by local Pashtun, who ultimately saved his life, as in his condition, without assistance, he would surely have been killed or captured by the Taliban.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} {{thirteen}} and early fourteenth centuries the Crown of Castile {{fought with the}} Marinids of Morocco and the Nasrids of Granada {{for control of the}} Strait of Gibraltar. This conflict (...) is a major chapter {{in the history of the}} Christian reconquest of Spain. Although no documentary account of Gibraltar is available for the period following the creation of Madinat al-Fath, there are reasons to believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of Tarifa in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that the Castilian king Sancho IV would lay siege to Algeciras (though in the event, he did not do so) to hinder the Marinids' communications with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have made it necessary to set up a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would protect the rearguard of Algeciras and provided a <b>fallback</b> <b>position</b> if the town fell. At the same time, the heights of the Rock of Gibraltar provided an excellent vantage point for monitoring the activities of the Christian fleets in the Straits.|$|E
2500|$|The 2/8th Battalion was {{effectively}} destroyed as a fighting {{force for the}} rest of the Greek campaign. According to some accounts, at its <b>fallback</b> <b>position</b> of Rodona, the battalion could muster only 250 men, of whom only 50 had weapons. Although the 2/4th Battalion had been spared the brunt of the German assault at Vevi, it had 70 personnel taken prisoner at a German roadblock during its retreat to Sotir. The Germans claimed 480 [...] "English" [...] prisoners at Vevi for the loss of 37 dead, 95 wounded and two taken prisoner. For Witt, the victory was perhaps overshadowed by the death of his brother, also a member of LSSAH, whose vehicle drove over a mine during the battle. Gerhard Pleiss – a platoon commander whose men captured the highest point – was subsequently awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, the highest German award for bravery on the battlefield.

This study was initiated to provide that assessment. A working simulation model was the primary deliverable of this study.

40|$|Nuclear {{waste is}} {{presently}} stored in 177 underground storage tanks at -the U. S. Department of Energy`s Hanford Site in Washington State. The storage tanks are of two construction types, 149 single-shell tanks (SSTS) and 28 double-shell tanks (DSTs). No waste {{has been added}} to the SSTs since 1980. However, the DSTs are configured to receive additional waste from site waste generators. The overall waste inventory is time dependent and strongly influenced by present and future tank farm operations. These operations include waste evaporation, retrieval, pretreatment, and processing; waste generated from various site facilities; and SST waste inventory transferred to the DSTS. A risk-based simulation model was developed to replicate the waste inventory through the year 2015. The DST waste,,; were divided into three waste types (aging, complexed, @md non-complexed) that were simulated in the model. For each of the three waste types, statistical analyses were performed and the time-de,Pendent waste volumes at the ``mean`` and `` 90 % confidence level`` were compared with existing DST capacity. Several ``off-normal`` operation scenarios were also analyzed using the risk-based simulation model. Mitigating actions or <b>fallback</b> <b>positions</b> were modeled where off- normal scenarios indicated that capacity shortfalls could potentially occur. The results indicated that selected <b>fallback</b> <b>positions</b> were adequate to ensure that the storage capacity exceeded the waste invento 0167 ry during the affected time periods...|$|R

In many contexts this is a convenient and innocuous assumption. It can be quite restrictive, however, when investigating the causes and welfare consequences of gender differences in agriculture. In response to a growing number of econometric studies that have found strong evidence against the hypothesis that households act as if they are individuals, researchers have proposed a number of different models of the interaction that occurs between individuals within the household. Many of these models share with the standard model the assumption that the allocation of resources is Pareto efficient. These models make a variety of alternative assumptions, however, concerning the sharing rule within the household and the threat points used as <b>fallback</b> <b>positions</b> by the individuals in the household in the event that a cooperative equilibrium is not achieved.

40|$|In Ghana like {{in other}} {{developing}} countries, microfinance has been acknowledged as a pro-poor development intervention {{because of its}} special programme models in meeting {{the special needs of}} the poor especially women. The Ghanaian informal economic landscape is replete with MFIs, which are assumed to have varied orientations and outcomes for their clients. MFIs have long provided microfinance products and services with the expectation of improving the socio-economic and political wellbeing of the Ghanaian woman. This study explores the contributions of microfinance programmes to poverty reduction and empowerment among women. In addition, the study examines not only the challenges that confront MFIs in the implementation of their programmes but also the challenges that women face in the use of microfinance schemes provided by MFIs. Specific objectives were developed to facilitate the achievement of the aims of the study. Qualitative methodologies were used to collect the primary data from about 29 informants recruited from the MFIs. Three conceptual frameworks were used to examine the data (the informality-formality framework, the theory of empowerment and the household analysis framework). The study found that the MFIs give credits with conditions that are not favourable to the needs of women. It was also found that the dependency burdens on women coupled with the low credit that the women access from the MFIs for their productive activities lead the women to deploy the credits {{to meet the demands of}} both their businesses and households. As a result, the women are put under stress as they strive to meet their basic needs and to avoid defaults. The study also found that irrespective of the women's access to credits and incomes their bargaining power and <b>fallback</b> <b>positions</b> in household decision-making processes are largely defined by the gendered regimes within the household economy. I therefore argue that the MFIs have implicitly sought to help women to effectively carry out their gendered role within the separate spheres in the household. This is contrary to the expectations of feminist perspective on microfinance programmes that expects MFIs to provide the basis for the strengthening of individual agency or group solidarity in demanding social transformation through the provision of financial services and gender-based sensitization programmes. I therefore suggest that attempts to help women to reduce poverty and to empower themselves should go beyond making only financial products available to women. It should include mainstreaming educational programmes that will help women to mobilize individual agency and group solidarity to resist, challenge and ultimately transform institutional structures that may inhibit the promotion of gender equality...|$|R
