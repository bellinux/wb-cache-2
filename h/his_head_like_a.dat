5|$|Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Buddhist monk in protest. Mẫu {{had decided}} to leave the country for a {{religious}} pilgrimage to India and the diplomatic and press corps assembled at the airport to see him off. He never arrived, as the Ngô family had him arrested. General Đính softened the punishment at the behest of a fellow officer, and put the former diplomat under house arrest instead of placing him in jail.|$|E
500|$|Ambitious and active-minded, Saint-Just worked {{urgently}} and tirelessly {{towards his}} goals: [...] "For Revolutionists {{there is no}} rest but in the tomb." [...] He was repeatedly described by contemporaries as arrogant, believing {{himself to be a}} skilled leader and orator as well as having proper revolutionary character. This self-assurance manifested itself in a superiority complex, and he always “made it clear… that he considered himself to be in charge and that his will was law.” Camille Desmoulins once wrote of Saint-Just, [...] "He carries <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sacred host." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1963, Nhu, who {{controlled}} {{the special forces}} and secret police, allowed Đính to have a hand in planning raids against Buddhist dissidents who had been organising at the Xá Lợi pagoda, Saigon's largest. The raids involved the deployment of the 5th Division, based {{in the town of}} Biên Hòa on Saigon's northern outskirts, into the capital. Although the execution of the raids—which left hundreds dead—was primarily the responsibility of Colonel Lê Quang Tung, the special forces head, Đính privately took responsibility, stating to a journalist, [...] "I have defeated Henry Cabot Lodge [...] He came here to stage a coup d'etat, but I, Tôn Thất Đính, have conquered him and saved the country." [...] In the aftermath of the raids, Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned in protest, shaved <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> monk and sought to leave on a pilgrimage to India; Nhu ordered Đính to jail him. At the urging of another general, Đính put Mẫu under house arrest instead.|$|E

6000|$|... "There's special Providence that he didn't crack <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> eggshell on the quarter-deck mooring-bits, sir. The men {{tell me he}} couldn't {{have missed}} them by more than an inch." ...|$|R
500|$|The Doctor has {{prepared}} the house specially {{for the children}} and the holiday; though the children are pleased, Madge privately explains about Reg's death to the Doctor and insists he not overindulge the children. During the first night, Cyril is lured into opening a large glowing present under the Christmas tree, revealing a time portal to a snow-covered forest. The Doctor shortly discovers Cyril's absence and follows him with Lily; they eventually track Cyril to a strange lighthouse-like structure. Madge, finding her children missing, soon follows them into the forest, but is met by three miners in space suits from the planet Androzani Major (Bill Bailey, Paul Bazely, and Arabella Weir). She holds them at gunpoint and is taken back to their excavation walker and told that the forest of the planet they are on is scheduled to be melted by acid rain within minutes, killing anything within it. At the lighthouse, Cyril is met by a humanoid creature made of wood; it places a simple band of metal around <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> crown. Lily and the Doctor arrive, followed by another wood creature, but find the creatures have rejected Cyril as he is [...] "weak", as they do the Doctor. The Doctor concludes that the life forces of the trees in the forest are trying to escape through a living creature, the crown acting as an interface.|$|E
2500|$|Madame Nhu Trần Lệ Xuân, Nhu's wife, {{inflamed}} {{the situation}} by mockingly applauding the suicides, stating, [...] "If the Buddhists want to have another barbecue, I {{will be glad to}} supply the gasoline." [...] The pagoda raids stoked widespread public disquiet in Saigon. Students at Saigon University boycotted classes and rioted, which led to arrests, imprisonments, and the closure of the university; this was repeated at Huế University. When high school students demonstrated, Diệm arrested them as well; over 1,000 students from Saigon's leading high school, most of them children of Saigon civil servants, were sent to re-education camps, including, reportedly, children as young as five, on charges of anti-government graffiti. Diệm's foreign minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Buddhist monk in protest. When he attempted to leave the country on a religious pilgrimage to India, he was detained and kept under house arrest.|$|E

6000|$|... "He's still breathing," [...] {{the other}} said, {{examining}} him; [...] "the back o' <b>his</b> <b>head's</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bag o' dice though. The skull's all splintered. He can't last. What {{are we to}} do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Recovering? He's blind, then." [...] And Tom set {{his teeth}} more tightly than ever. He felt a sob rise in his throat, but choked it down, shaking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{impatient}} bull.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do {{not wish}} to eat yet.' He turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old {{tortoise}} in the sunlight. 'Is it true that there are many images in the Wonder House of Lahore?' He repeated the last words as one making sure of an address.|$|R
60|$|Dick obediently ceased his chant of Mountain Lad, but shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{stubborn}} colt.|$|E

6000|$|The boy shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{impatient}} horse. [...] "Too slow--too slow for me, to {{wait and}} wait, as Wordsworth did, through long years of obscurity, misconception, ridicule. No. What I have, I must have at once; and, if it must be, die like Chatterton--if only, like Chatterton, I can have my little day of success, and make the world confess that another priest of the beautiful has arisen among men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Cause it's such jolly fun," [...] replied Willie; {{with real}} enthusiasm, [...] "reg'lar bangin' crashin' sort o' work--as good as fightin' any day! An' my brother Frank's a fireman. Such a one, too, you've no notion; six fut four he is, an' as strong as--oh, why, ma'am, {{he could take}} you up in one hand, ma'am, an' twirl you round <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old hat! He was at the fire in Beverly Square last night." ...|$|R
60|$|He swelled his biceps proudly {{under the}} thin sleeve, {{reached for the}} two black stewards, and put them above <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pair of dumbbells.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Pumblechook worked <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> screw {{to screw}} {{it out of}} me, and said, [...] "Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for instance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tracked! Whar 'd you git thet idee? As soon as this?" [...] queried Anson, lifting <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{striking}} snake. His men, likewise, betrayed sudden interest.|$|E

60|$|He {{threw back}} <b>his</b> great <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> horse that feels the curb, and his {{smouldering}} eyes {{looked up at}} me balefully. Then his sensuous lips parted in scorn.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, then, don't say old Harry don't know nothing, that's all, eh?' {{and the old}} fellow toddled off, peering and {{twisting}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> about <b>like</b> <b>a</b> starling.|$|R
60|$|He {{could say}} no more, but, laying <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little {{child on the}} broad bosom of his rescuer, he burst into a passionate flood of tears.|$|E
60|$|Birkin did not answer. He rowed {{towards the}} land. And Gerald sat mute, like a dumb beast, panting, his teeth chattering, his arms inert, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> seal's head.|$|E

60|$|So I {{told him}} the {{outlines}} of our tale; {{for an hour or}} more I told it while he sat opposite to us swaying <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tortoise and saying nothing. At length it was done.|$|E
60|$|Here the Major, {{under cover}} of the dark room, shut up one eye, rolled <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Harlequin, and, in his great self-satisfaction, perhaps went nearer to the {{confines}} of apoplexy {{than he had ever}} gone before.|$|E
60|$|As if {{to prove}} his {{friendship}} the squirrel now darted out of the hollow and sat upon a limb beside the children, holding his bushy tail straight up so that it stood above <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> big plume in a soldier's helmet.|$|E
6000|$|Now it {{happened}} {{about this time}} that Robin Hood {{was going through the}} forest to Fosse Way, to see what was to be seen there, for the moon was full and the night gave promise of being bright. In his hand he carried his stout oaken staff, and at his side hung his bugle horn. As thus he walked up a forest path, whistling, down another path came the Tinker, muttering to himself and shaking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> angry bull; and so, at a sudden bend, they met sharply face to face. Each stood still for a time, and then Robin spoke: ...|$|R

5000|$|Marlowe's client, Moose Malloy, {{is played}} by Jack O'Halloran, a former {{professional}} prizefighter. Mitchum called O'Halloran [...] "one great find on this picture.
