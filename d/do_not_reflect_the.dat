5|$|Murder on the Orient Express is {{the first}} game in the Agatha Christie series to feature Hercule Poirot, Christie's most popular and famous detective. David Suchet, whose {{portrayal}} of Poirot achieved fame through the popular television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, was hired to provide Poirot's voice. His performance was generally met with praise. Some have criticized the game for not allowing the player to actually control Poirot; the developers explained this choice by saying that adventure gamers who make mistakes throughout the game <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> genius of Poirot, but are better represented by amateur sleuth Antoinette Marceau.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2012, {{current issues}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> {{expansion}} of the European Union, as Cyprus is not depicted on current notes as the map does not extend far enough east and Malta is also missing as it {{does not meet the}} current series' minimum size for depiction. Since the European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every seven or eight years after each issue, a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical of the current series; bridges and arches. However, they would still be recognisable as a new series.|$|E

25|$|Croneberger also {{established}} a Canon for Congregational Development, which is helping churches with the challenging task of {{planning for the}} future. In the past 30 or so years the diocese has struggled {{to keep up with}} the growing population in the region. 23 congregations have closed (compared with a 2% increase nationwide) due to dropping attendance. A major obstacle is the concentration of churches, many of which are over 100 years old, in traditional population centers that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> growth patterns in the state. Numerous churches are within five miles of 15 other congregations. Another diocesan commission, the Bethsaida Team, helps churches overcome obstacles for people with disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Three {{commonly}} mentioned philosophical {{precepts of}} occupational therapy are that occupation {{is necessary for}} health, that its theories are based on holism and that its central components are people, their occupations (activities), and the environments in which those activities take place. However, {{there have been some}} dissenting voices. Mocellin, in particular, advocated abandoning the notion of health through occupation as he proclaimed it obsolete in the modern world. As well, he questioned the appropriateness of advocating holism when practice rarely supports it. Some values formulated by the American Occupational Therapy Association have been critiqued as being therapist-centric and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> modern reality of multicultural practice.|$|E

When he finds out that Mrs. Norval has told Lola to sleep in the maid's chambers, he demands that she give Lola a proper furnished room. While other characters wish to keep Lola for purely financial reasons, Dr. Norval and Julian's motivations are more altruistic. Dr. Norval refuses to accept the half of Lola's immense fortune that her mother had insisted. Instead, he only takes six percent of Lola's inheritance. He and his son Julian are the only characters who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> self-deception, greed and hypocrisy that the novel criticizes as the American national character.|$|E
25|$|The {{recovery}} criteria largely {{pertain to}} habitat, in particular a {{minimum number of}} sites (four) and habitat stability for those sites in the Lower Keys. However, only one Lower Keys site is currently occupied by a persistent population, whereas more populations and larger numbers of Orthalicus reses reses occur at various sites in the Upper Keys. In the Lower Keys, the No Name Key population {{is the only one}} that persists in natural surroundings and generally appears to be viable. Accordingly, the criteria <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> best available and most up-to-date information on the biology of the species because they treat the Lower Keys as the only area to conduct reintroductions and otherwise achieve recovery for Orthalicus reses reses. Moreover, significant threats in addition to habitat loss have emerged, and these are not adequately addressed in the recovery criteria.|$|E
25|$|In January 2015, {{the poverty}} stats was updated to 2013: 19.5% of the {{population}} were at risk of poverty after social transfers, meaning their disposable income was below their national at-risk-of-poverty threshold, which is set at 60% of the national median income per adult equivalent numbering nearly 2 million people. According to ISEG economist, Carlos Farinha Rodrigues Portugal went back 10 years {{in terms of social}} reality, having lost all the progress that was made until 2009. The risk of poverty after social transfers for men is 18.9%, 20% for women, 25.6% for children, 38.4% for monoparental families with at least one child, 15.4% for two parents and on child and 28.8% for other aggregates with children (elderly, etc.). The National Statistics Institute made a separate calculation, basing their data in 2009 {{in order to have a}} poverty line that doesn't decrease because of the income decreases associated with the crisis: with this calculation, the poverty risk increase is far greater with 17.9% in 2009 to 25.9% 4 years later. The Prime-Minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, has stated that these numbers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> current situation.|$|E

25|$|When using RFLP, the {{theoretical}} {{risk of a}} coincidental match is 1 in 100 billion (100,000,000,000), although the practical risk is actually 1 in 1000 because monozygotic twins are 0.2% of the human population. Moreover, the rate of laboratory error is almost certainly higher than this, and often actual laboratory procedures <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> theory under which the coincidence probabilities were computed. For example, the coincidence probabilities may be calculated based on the probabilities that markers in two samples have bands in precisely the same location, but a laboratory worker may conclude that similar—but not precisely identical—band patterns result from identical genetic samples with some imperfection in the agarose gel. However, in this case, the laboratory worker increases the coincidence risk by expanding the criteria for declaring a match. Recent studies have quoted relatively high error rates, which may be cause for concern. In {{the early days of}} genetic fingerprinting, the necessary population data to accurately compute a match probability was sometimes unavailable. Between 1992 and 1996, arbitrary low ceilings were controversially put on match probabilities used in RFLP analysis rather than the higher theoretically computed ones. Today, RFLP has become widely disused due to the advent of more discriminating, sensitive and easier technologies.|$|E
25|$|The {{comparative}} use of Census Bureau data, {{as well as}} most {{sources of}} demographic income data, has been questioned by statisticians for being unable to account for 'mobility of incomes'. At any given time, the Census Bureau ranks all households by household income and then divides this distribution of households into quintiles. The highest-ranked household in each quintile provides the upper income limit for each quintile. Comparing changes in these upper income limits for different quintiles is how changes are measured between one moment in time and the next. The problem with inferring income inequality on this basis is that the census statistics provide only a snapshot of income distribution in the U.S., at individual points in time. The statistics <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> reality that income for many households changes over time – i.e., incomes are mobile. For most people, income increases over time as they move from their first, low-paying job in high school to a better-paying job later in their lives. Also, some people lose income over time because of business-cycle contractions, demotions, career changes, retirement, etc. The implication of changing individual incomes is that individual households do not remain in the same income quintiles over time. Thus, comparing different income quintiles over time is like comparing apples to oranges, because it means comparing incomes of different people at different stages in their earnings profile.|$|E
