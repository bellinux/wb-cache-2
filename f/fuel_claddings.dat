The most commonly used technique for performing active interrogation is to use an electronic neutron generator as the probe radiation source. Exploiting the unique operating characteristics of these devices, including their monoenergetic neutron emissions and their ability to operate in pulsed modes, presents a number of options for performing prompt and delayed signature analyses using both photon and neutron sensors. A review of literature in this area shows multiple applications of the active neutron interrogation technique for performing nuclear nonproliferation measurements.

40|$|In {{creating}} a large-scale atomic-hydrogen power industry, {{the resolution of}} technological issues associated with high temperatures in reactor plants (900 °C) and large hydrogen concentrations intended as long-term resources takes on particular importance. The paper considers technological aspects of removing impurities from high-temperature sodium used as a coolant in the high-temperature fast reactor (BN-HT) 600 MW (th.) intended {{for the production of}} hydrogen as well as other innovative applications. The authors examine the behavior of impurities in the BN-HT circuits associated with the mass transfer intensification at high temperatures (Arrhenius law) in different operating modes. Special attention is given to sodium purification from hydrogen, tritium and corrosion products in the BN-HT. Sodium purification from hydrogen and tritium by their evacuation through vanadium or niobium membranes will make it possible to develop compact highly-efficient sodium purification systems. It has been shown that sodium purification from tritium to concentrations providing the maximum permissible concentration of the produced hydrogen (3. 6 Bq/l according to NRB- 99 / 2009) specifies more stringent requirements to the hydrogen removal system, i. e., the permeability index of the secondary tritium removal system should exceed 140 kg/s. Provided that a BN-HN-type reactor meets these conditions, the bulk of tritium (98 %) will be accumulated in the compact sodium purification system of the secondary circuit, 0. 6 % (∼ 4 · 104 Bq/s), will be released into the environment and 1. 3 % will enter the product (hydrogen). The intensity of corrosion products (CPs) coming into sodium is determined by the corrosion rate of structural materials: at a high temperature level, a significant amount of corrosion products flows into sodium. The performed calculations showed that, for the primary BN-HT circuit, the amount of corrosion products formed at the oxygen concentration in sodium of 1 mln– 1 exceeds 900 kg/yr with <b>fuel</b> element <b>claddings</b> made of EP- 912 -VD steel and 464 kg/yr with molybdenum alloy claddings. For the secondary circuit, the amount of corrosion products totals 263 kg/yr for each loop. Taking into account the high-temperature experiments which demonstrated high efficiency of retaining corrosion product suspensions by the strainers located in the low-temperature area, it is proposed to cool sodium to the required temperature alongside the corrosion products retention on the mass transfer surfaces, including strainers. It is shown that, by using 30 % of the power required to produce hydrogen with 50 % efficiency, the BN-HT is capable of producing about 0. 6 · 106 m 3 of hydrogen per 24 hours which is sufficient for modern large-scale enterprises processing medium-grade crude oil or the implementation of other technologies...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} transient heat transfer phenomena of interest for the thermal-hydraulic analysis of nuclear reactor core {{during the course of}} a postulated reactivity insertion accident (RIA). An instantaneous extraction of control rods may cause the so called prompt jump, if the reactivity insertion is larger than the reactor β, usually referred to as reactor dollar. Associated to the prompt jump of the neutron flux, an exponential increase of the thermal power produced within the fuel rods is observed. Consequently, the heat flux from the fuel to the coolant also increases, making the coolant to heat up and eventually boiling. The thermal-hydraulic feedbacks caused by the heating and, most of all, the formation of voids, cause an insertion of negative reactivity that tends to stabilize the reactor core power. It may happen however, that before the thermal-hydraulic feedbacks produce a stabi- lizing effect on the neutron flux, the energy stored within the fuel is large enough to cause the fuel rod to melt down. Then, the fuel melted and released in the bulk of the coolant may lead to the undesired phenomenon of steam explosion. Whether the thermal power is stabilized to a safe level before fuel melting could occur or not depends on the growth rate of the thermal power (and therefore the reactivity inserted) and the time delay between the production of the thermal energy within the fuel and the transfer of this energy to the coolant. Indeed, due to finite heat capacities and thermal conductivities within the different structures (<b>fuel</b> and <b>claddings),</b> the heat transferred to the coolant can be significantly lower than the heat released in the fuel at the same moment, leading to an accumulation of energy within the fuel. In order to contribute to the understanding and the prediction of power excursion transient, a fundamental analysis of transient heat transfer phenomena has been performed. Aim of this analysis is to provide a clear quantification of the rate of energy transfer between the fuel and the coolant during the transient, as a function of the subchannel geometry, material properties and the characteristic time scale of the exponential power excursion (the so called period). A multi-slices configuration is considered, representative of plate fuel type subchannels, typical of experimental assemblies, like those of the SPERT and the BORAX reactors described in chapter 2. A two-step analysis is proposed. In a first instance, the analysis of purely conductive systems is carried out. Then, the effects of coolant convection are investigated. In the purely conductive case, both the numerical (CFD) and the analytical solutions of the heat transfer equation have been obtained. The analytic solution has provided the exact formulation for the spatial temperature profile all along the transient. Basing on the temperature profile, other relevant quantities have been resumed, i. e. the disequilibrium between the energy produced within the fuel end the energy transferred to the coolant (defined as R) and the heat transfer coefficient between the solid structures and the coolant. Last but not least, the mutual verification of the models has been achieved. The CFD model, verified against the analytic solutions for the purely conductive systems, has been thus applied to investigate convection effects associated to the coolant motion. The boundary conditions of the SPERT-IV experimental campaign have been thus addressed in order to define the phenomenology of heat transfer associated to the different tests. This aims at drawing guidelines for the application of correlations for the thermal disequilibrium and the heat transfer coefficient in system codes and subchannel codes...|$|R
40|$|Neutron {{irradiation}} {{in nuclear}} power plants leads to microstructural changes resulting in the degradation of important properties in structural materials. One {{of the effects of}} neutron irradiation is a shift of the ductile to brittle transition temperature (DBTT) towards higher temperatures. The need for characterizing in service materials from {{nuclear power plants}} as well as irradiation testing of new materials has led to a need for test techniques using only a small amount of material. The small punch test is one of these techniques: a small hemispherical punch is pushed along its axis of symmetry through a small disc shaped specimen. Normally either the punch is pushed at a fixed displacement rate and the force is measured as a function of displacement (tensile test) or the force is kept constant and the displacement is measured as a function of time (creep test).

40|$|Fuel {{cladding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} critical components of nuclear reactors; so it is important to improve our understanding of various properties and behaviors of the cladding under different conditions approximating the nuclear reactor environment. Moreover, the efficiency of energy production, in addition to safety concerns, has resulted in progressive improvement of nuclear reactors design from Generation I to Generation IV. To complement this progressive trend, materials used for fuel cladding need to be improved or new materials should be developed. In this thesis, I address problems in the improvement of present fuel cladding and also investigate fuel cladding materials to be used in future Generation IV nuclear reactors. In the case of current Zircaloy- 4 <b>fuel</b> <b>claddings,</b> a detailed evaluation of the surface roughness effects on their performance and properties of Zircaloy- 4 <b>fuel</b> <b>claddings</b> was studied. A smoother surface on Zircaloy- 4 cladding tubes is demanded by the customers; however no systematic study is available addressing the effect of surface roughness on the claddings’ performance. Thus the effects of surface roughness on texture, oxidation, hydriding behaviors and mechanical properties of Zircaloy- 4 cladding tubes were investigated using various methods. It was found that surface roughness has some effects on the oxidation of Zircaloy- 4. Increasing the surface roughness would increase the weight gain, however, this effect was more pronounced at the initial oxidation stages. Synchrotron techniques were used to characterize the electronic structure of zirconium alloys in their oxidized and hydrided states. With this approach, complex interactions between hydrogen and oxygen in the zirconium matrix could be investigated, which could not be resolved using conventional methods. As a candidate for future fuel cladding material, Incoloy 800 H/HT, which is expected to be considered in super-critical water-cooled Gen IV reactors, was studied in order to optimize microstructure, texture and grain boundary characteristics. A specific Thermo-Mechanical Processing (TMP) was employed to manipulate the texture, microstructure and grain boundary character distribution. The deformation and annealing textures of thermo-mechanically processed samples were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction and orientation imaging microscopy. It was found that different rolling paths lead to different textures. The origin of different textures in differently (unidirectional and cross) rolled Incoloy 800 H/HT at high deformation strains were investigated. In addition, the recrystallization kinetic of differently rolled samples was studied. It was found that the oriented nucleation plays an important role in determining the recrystallization texture. Unidirectional rolled samples exhibited a faster recrystallization kinetic compared with cross rolled ones, due to the presence of γ-fibre. The effect of the aforementioned microstructural parameters (grain size, texture and GBCD) on the oxidation resistance of Incoloy 800 H/HT in super-critical water was investigated. It was found that the oxidation resistance of Incoloy 800 H/HT can be improved by TMP. The optimum TMP process for enhancing the oxidation resistance was proposed. Microstructural parameters that can improve the oxidation resistance of Incoloy 800 H/HT were identified. These findings will contribute to the effective selection of fuel cladding material for application in Gen IV SCW reactors...|$|E
40|$|This work {{addresses}} several specific knowledge gaps {{that exist}} in the use of alternative fuel and cladding combinations in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) environment. In the switch from a UO 2 with zirconium-based cladding to any other combination, there is a multitude of questions that need to be answered. This work examines three of these knowledge gaps: (1) the disposition of weapons-grade plutonium in thorium and silicon carbide cladding, (2) economics of accident tolerant <b>fuel</b> (ATF) <b>claddings</b> and (3) breeding of plutonium in uranium nitride fuel. Burning weapons-grade plutonium in a standard pressurized water reactor (PWR) using thoria as a fuel matrix has been compared to using urania. Two cladding options were considered: a 0. 76 mm thick silicon carbide ceramic matrix composite (SiC CMC) and 0. 57 mm thick standard Zircaloy cladding. A large benefit was found in using thoria compared to urania in terms of plutonium percentage and mass burned. A slightly smaller mass of plutonium is required in a core with SiC CMC cladding, due to its lower neutron absorption compared to Zircaloy. The thorium system was also better from a non-proliferation viewpoint, resulting in less fissile mass at discharge and more fissile mass burned over an assembly's lifetime. A limited safety comparison was made for two reactivity insertion accidents: (1) highest worth rod ejection accident (REA) and (2) main steam line break (MSLB). The MSLB accident demonstrated a safe value for the minimum departure from nucleate boiling ratio. The maximum enthalpy added to the fuel during the REA was also below current regulatory limits for PWRs. This indicates that the more negative moderator temperature coefficients of thoria-plutonia and urania-plutonia fuel, compared to a typical PWR design, were not limiting. For an ATF cladding to replace zirconium alloys, it must be economically viable by having similar fuel cycle costs to today's materials. Four proposed materials are examined: stainless steel (SS), FeCrAl alloy, molybdenum (Mo) and SiC CMC, each having its own development time and costs. The chosen cladding thicknesses were dependent on strength and manufacturing constraints. It was found that all options may end up requiring higher enrichment than zirconium-based claddings for the same fuel cycle length. If the present value of avoiding a reactor accident with a large radioactivity release is estimated using past experience for LWR large accidents and if it is assumed that ATF cladding is able to prevent such release, there is a definite net economic benefit relative to typical Zircaloy cladding only in using SiC, since it only results in a small fuel cycle cost increase. There is only a marginal benefit in using SiC to prevent a core-only loss without radioactivity release (TMI-type) accident and a large loss using metallic ATF concepts. The thermal hydraulic and neutronic feasibility of a nitride fueled pressurized water reactor (PWR) breeder design were examined. Because of its higher fuel density, nitride fuel would be preferable to traditional oxide fuel in attempting to achieve breeding in a PWR. The design chosen uses large hexagonal assemblies with 14 inner seed pin rows and 4 outer blanket pin rows. In this design, reactor grade plutonium of 12. 75 wtHM was used as fuel. Nitride was also simulated as being 100 % N- 15, to limit neutronic penalties and C- 14 production. The as specified assembly model only achieved a fissile inventory ratio (FIR) value above 1. 0 when the thimble regions were assumed to be voided, which lowers the H/HM ratio in the assembly. This led to FIR values above 1. 0 for the oxide, 85 % theoretical density nitride (N 85) and 95 % theoretical density nitride (N 95). All were at an FIR of 1. 03 at 35 MWd/kgHM. However, the single batch discharge burnup of the voided assembly in MWd/kgHM was 32. 2 for N 95, 24. 5 for N 85, while only 15. 6 for the oxide. by Nathan Christopher Andrews. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|A {{literature}} review and analysis {{were made of}} corrosion and degradation processes applicable to Zircaloy cladding on spent nuclear fuel in a tuff repository. In particular, lifetime sought for the Zircaloy is 10, 000 years. Among the potential failure mechanisms examined were: oxidation by steam, air, and water, including the effects of ions whose presence is anticipated in the water; mechanical overload; stress (creep) rupture; stress-corrosion cracking (SCC); and delayed failure due to hydride cracking. The conclusion is that failure due to oxidation is not credible, although a few experiments are suggested to confirm the effect of aqueous fluoride on the Zircaloy cladding. Mechanical overload is not a problem, and failure from stress-rupture does not appear likely based on a modified Larson-Miller analysis. Analysis shows that delayed hydride cracking is not anticipated {{for the bulk of}} spent fuel pins. However, for a minority of pins under high stress, there is some uncertainty in the analysis as a result of: (1) uncertainty about crack depths in spent <b>fuel</b> <b>claddings</b> and (2) the effect of slow cooling on the formation of radially oriented hydride precipitates. Experimental resolution is called for. Finally, insufficient information is currently available on stress-corrosion cracking. While evidence is presented that SCC failure is not likely to occur, it is difficult to demonstrate this conclusively because the process is not clearly understood and data are limited. Further experimental work on SCC susceptibility is especially needed...|$|E

Zirconium alloys are however susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Precipitation of zirconium hydrides is attributed to the embrittlement effect in zirconium alloys. In this project ab-initio simulations of Zr and the three different zirconium hydrides -ZrH, -ZrH 1 : 5 and -ZrH 2 are performed to calculate structural, elastic and thermal properties of these different compounds. The goal with the project was to calculate the equilibrium structures of the H-Zr system using ab-initio methods. The results from the calculations of thermal and mechanical properties {{were found to be}} in good agreement with previous results and experiments where these were available. Calcula- tions of the phonon band structure for the different hydrides show that the band structure of the hydrides has two characteristic bands, one corresponding to vibrations in the zirconium sublattice and one cor- responding to vibrations in the hydrogen sublattice. The calculated heat capacity of the different compounds was found to be described very well by the Einstein model for the heat capacity of a solid. By calculating the free energy of formation for the different compounds it was found that at high hydrogen concentrations -hydride is the equi- librium structure. At intermediate hydrogen levels the equilibrium structure can't be determined...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the segmented expanding mandrel (SEM) test for material characterization and structural integrity assessment of nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>claddings.</b> The loading is induced by expanding segments, which are placed inside a cladding tube, radially to simulate cracked fuel that expands thermally. Experimental results are presented for zircaloy- 2 cladding tubes for different number of segments. The tests are analysed with semi-analytical models and two-dimensional finite element models. A complex stress field with stress concentrations occurs {{at the edge of the}} segments, which simulates pellet cladding interaction. The variation of the stresses and the strength of the stress and strain concentrations increases with fewer segments and increases strongly with higher friction coefficient between segments and the cladding tube. By increasing the number of segments and ensuring a low friction coefficient, the deformation is close to axi-symmetric and the SEM can be used to determine qualitatively the material properties such as fracture criteria and stress¿strain curves, but the test is more appropriate for assessment of how defects and microstructure affect ductility. For simulation of mechanical pellet-cladding interaction it is important that the friction coefficient is representative. The resulting stress concentrations promote failure at lower loads and need to be taken into account for the integrity assessment. The SEM test can then be used as a relatively simple test for assessment of pellet fuel cladding interaction. JRC. DDG. F. 5 -Safety of present nuclear reactor...|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen induced {{embrittlement}} {{and associated}} cracking effects in Zirconium alloys impose a serious problem, for example, within {{the nuclear industry}} where these materials are used {{in a range of}} applications, including <b>fuel</b> <b>claddings.</b> To get a fuller understanding of the hydrogen diffusion, hydride formation and phase transformations taking place at conditions of external stress and at elevated temperature it is crucial to augment experimental measurements with multi-level modelling. It is, for example, possible to simulate hydride phase-transformation trough phase-field calculations[1]. In order to get accurate results from these calculations, however, {{it is important to have}} basic physical information, such as interfacial energies and elastic constants. The latter were obtained completely from first principle calculations of density functional theory. In pure zirconium, at low hydrogen concentrations and at low temperatures, hydrogen atoms are dissolved into the matrix and preferentially occupy tetrahedral sites within the thermodynamically stable aZr hexagonal closed packed unit cell. At higher concentrations the various face centred cubic and tetragonal hydride phases start to form. Using the plane-wave code DACAPO, within the generalized gradient approximation, the lattice parameters and the ionic positions of bulk aZr, dZrHx and gZrHx were relaxed with respect to total energies. The formation energies as well as bulk moduli were then obtained by fitting total energies as a function of lattice parameters with a 3 rd or 4 th order polynomial. By comparing the present results with previous calculations and experiments it was possible to validate the methods for further use. The results, thus, comprise a foundation and serves to verify methods and codes. The next step is to compute more complex properties such as surface free energies, or interfacial energies, of bi-phase Zr-H systems, so that the full multiscale model can be implemented. 1. V.

40|$|The morphology, number density, orientation, distribution, and crystallographic {{aspects of}} Zr {{hydrides}} in Zircaloy fuel cladding play {{important roles in}} fuel performance during all phases before and after discharge from the reactor, i. e., during normal operation, transient and accident situations in the reactor, temporary storage in a dry cask, and permanent storage in a waste repository. In the past, partly because of experimental difficulties, hydriding behavior in irradiated fuel cladding has been investigated mostly by optical microscopy (OM). In the present study, fundamental metallurgical and crystallographic characteristics of hydride precipitation and reorientation were investigated on the microscopic level by combined techniques of OM and transmission electron and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM) of spent-fuel claddings discharged from several boiling and pressurized water reactors (BWRs and PWRs). Defueled sections of standard and Zr-lined Zircaloy- 2 <b>fuel</b> <b>claddings,</b> irradiated to fluences of {approx} 3. 3 x 10 {sup 21 } n cm{sup {minus} 2 } and {approx} 9. 2 x 10 {sup 21 } n cm{sup {minus} 2 } (E > 1 MeV), respectively, were obtained from spent fuel rods discharged from two BWRs.

40|$|Titanium nitride {{coatings}} {{have been}} widely applied and studied as high temperature diffusion barrier for silicon devices in microelectronics, wear resistant coatings in turbine blade materials, and materials for future high temperature nuclear reactors. In order to enhance the material property, superlattices is one of artificially engineered protective coatings, such as AlN/TiN and TaN/TiN multilayered films. Epitaxial cubic multilayer films, TaN/TiN and AlN/TiN nanolayers were grown on Si(001) by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) with various nanolayer thicknesses and number of interfaces. Microstructural studies include X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high resolution TEM with ion-irradiation experiments. Electrical, mechanical and thermal property studies were conducted for the interface and size effects on the nanolayers by using nanoindentation and Transient Thermo-Reflectance (TTR) methods. The microstructural and hardness study on TaN/TiN films with ion irradiation (12 keV and 50 keV He) suggest no obvious microstructural or mechanical behavior change due to ion irradiation. In addition, titanium nitride that serves as effective diffusion barrier to prevent the inter-diffusion between the nuclear fuel and the cladding material was studied {{in order to enhance}} the lifetime of the fuels and the reliability of the <b>fuel</b> <b>claddings.</b> The TiN has good adhesion with the stainless steel and higher hardness than that of bulk TiN on the stainless steel. Thermal conductivity test demonstrates that thin TiN film has compatible thermal conductivity as the MA 957 and HT- 9 bars. The size effect on electrical resistivity is dominant in both of the epitaxial cubic and the polycrystalline TiN thin films in the thickness ranged from ~ 60 nm down to ~ 35 nm. In the TaN/TiN multilayer, the grain scattering effect on resistivity is dominant rather than interface influence on the resistivity with comparing epitaxial cubic phase and polycrystalline phase. The microstructure and hardness studies of the AlN/TiN multilayer films with He implantation present that the suppression of amorphization in AlN layers and the reduction of radiation-induced softening were achieved in all nanolayer films. Radiation tolerance was found to be size dependent and the layer thickness leading to the highest radiation tolerance was around 10 nm. In addition, the embedded epitaxial cubic AlN with cladding TiN nanolayers showed higher effective thermal conductivity than that of AlN single layer as well as the embedded polycrystalline AlN in the thickness ranged from 10 nm down to 2 nm. It confirms a suppressed size effect, which reduces the amount of decrease in through-plane thermal conductivity...|$|E
