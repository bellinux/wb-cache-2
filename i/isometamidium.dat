The fluorescence property of this compound was used to investigate {{the interaction of the}} molecule with in vitro-derived bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma congolense IL 1180. Incubation of <b>isometamidium</b> with trypanosomes at 37 degrees C for 180 min resulted in a gradual alteration of the lambda max. with time (from 600 to 584 nm) and an increase in the intensity of trypanosome-associated fluorescence of approx. 2 -fold.

To determine the effect of a single treatment with <b>isometamidium</b> chloride at 10 microg/ml on the fly's susceptibility to infection with <b>isometamidium</b> chloride-resistant trypanosome strains, treated flies were infected with one of two resistant isogenic T. congolense IL 1180 strains 3 d after the first feed. Results showed that a single <b>isometamidium</b> chloride treatment at 10 microg/ml blood sufficed to reduce significantly the fly's subsequent susceptibility to infection. Only 6. 8 % of the flies that were treated with <b>isometamidium</b> chloride developed a mature infection with T. congolense in the mouthparts compared with 34. 3 % of the control group.

In the highest risk area, the Kone settlement, an <b>isometamidium</b> block treatment study was conducted from April to June 2001. A total of 300 cattle were included in this study, 100 from each of three villages (Cheleleki, Kolu and Burka). At day minus 14 of the study, all 300 cattle were treated with diminazene aceturate at 7 mg/kg body weight. Subsequently, these cattle were ear-tagged and randomly assigned into two groups, 50 controls and 50 for <b>isometamidium</b> treatment in each village. Fourteen days later (day 0), the 50 treatment cattle were given <b>isometamidium</b> chloride at 1 mg/kg body weight.

40|$|Aim: The {{objective}} of {{present study was}} to determine Plasma Protein Binding (PPB) activity and its effect on clinical efficacy of <b>isometamidium</b> after intramuscular administration in calves. The binding of drugs to plasma proteins {{is an important factor in}} controlling the availability and distribution of drugs. In general, PPB reduces the free fraction of drug available for therapeutic activity, since only the non-protein bound drug is pharmacologically active. Materials and Methods: Six calves were used for PPB study and eighteen for clinical efficacy. <b>Isometamidium</b> was administered @ 0. 5 mg/kg intramuscularly as a single dose for PPB study. Equilibrium dialysis technique was used to determine the PPB activity. For clinical efficacy, infection with Trypanosoma was induced in calves of two groups, untreated control and experimental group. Infection was confirmed after 28 days by mice inoculation test. <b>Isometamidium</b> @ 0. 5 mg/kg was administered to experimental group. Haematoobiochemical and mice inoculation tests were performed after 7 days of drug administration (Day 35). Result: The percentage of PPB activity of <b>isometamidium</b> was 86. 71 &# 177; 0. 59 to 93. 03 &# 177; 0. 63 % against the concentration 9. 76 &# 177; 0. 84 to 4. 39 &# 177; 0. 20 g ml- 1.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of seven populations of T. congolense to the salts of three trypanocides, diminazene, <b>isometamidium</b> and homidium, were determined in vitro using in vitro-derived metacyclic trypanosomes. The trypanosomes were incubated at 35 degree centigrade for 48 hours with various drug concentrations (0. 5 ng- 50 ug/ml) and {{then transferred to}} cultures containing bovine endothelial-cell monolayers, to assess their viability over the following 5 days as compared to control trypanosomes that had been incubated without drug. The sensitivity to each drug was expressed as the minimum effective drug concentration which killed 100 percent of the trypanosomes in a given population within the 5 days. Using this assay, population IL 1180, characterised as being highly sensitive to all three drugs in vivo, required 10 ng/ml <b>isometamidium</b> chloride, 50 ng/ml homidium bromide or chloride and 5000 ng/ml diminazene aceturate to kill the entire population in vitro. In contrast, two derivatives of IL 1180 in which resistance to <b>isometamidium</b> had been induced in mice, IL 3343 and IL 3344, required <b>isometamidium</b> chloride at a concentration of 1000 ng/ml and 2000 ng/ml, respectively, to eliminate the populations. The in vitro {{results showed that the}} increase in level of resistance to <b>isometamidium</b> in these populations was associated with at least a 200 -fold increase in resistance in both populations to homidium, but no increase in resistance to diminazene.

Thereafter, the animals were challenged at monthly intervals with either a drug-sensitive clone (T. congolense IL 1180) or a clone expressing a moderate level of resistance to <b>isometamidium</b> (T. congolense IL 3343). Untreated control cattle were used to confirm the infectivity of each challenge. Of ten drug-treated cattle that were challenged with T. congolense IL 3343, all were refractory to infection at the first challenge, 1 month after drug administration. However, all ten animals succumbed to infection at either the second (seven cattle) or third (three cattle) monthly challenges. By contrast, all five drug-treated cattle challenged with T. congolense IL 1180 resisted four monthly challenges. The mean <b>isometamidium</b> concentration {{at the time of}} the first, 1 month, challenge was 5. 6 (+ or -) 2. 8 ng/ml. At the time of the second monthly challenge the mean concentration was 2. 0 (+ or -) 0. 86 ng/ml; at this time, concentrations were not significantly different between those cattle refractory to challenge with T. congolense IL 3343 and those cattle that were not. Thus, differences in susceptibility to challenge at this time would appear to be due to differences in the drug sensitivity of the parasite challenge. Finally, the mean <b>isometamidium</b> concentration in uninfected cattle {{at the time of the}} fourth monthly challenge was 0. 4 (+ or -) 0. 18 ng/ml. These results indicate that when T. congolense infection occurs in cattle under <b>isometamidium</b> prophylaxis, the parasites may be considered at least moderately drug resistant if the concentration of <b>isometamidium</b> in serum is 2. 0 ng/ml. At concentrations between 0. 4 and 2. 0 ng/ml a low level of drug resistance may be inferred. Below 0. 4 ng/ml, however, no inference regarding drug resistance should be made...|$|E

The study applies a production function framework integrating a damage control function to assess the short term productivity effect of trypanocide use under different epidemiological conditions. We found that the marginal value products of <b>isometamidium</b> in all epidemiological conditions, and the marginal value product of diminazene in high-prevalence-high-resistance conditions are positive and greater than one revealing an underuse of trypanocidal drugs in those conditions. The economical optimum level of <b>isometamidium</b> is far larger than the current use level. In a strict economic interpretation, this implies that in the short term cattle farmers could increase the profitability if they increase trypanocide input beyond current levels.

40|$|Bloodstream {{forms of}} four {{populations of the}} {{livestock}} pathogen Trypanosoma congolense, isolated from different natural infections, {{have been shown to}} exhibit a wide range of sensitivities to the trypanocide <b>isometamidium</b> chloride (Samorin(R)). In mice the 50 % curative doses (CD 50) for Samorin range from 0. 007 to 20 mg/kg body weight. Uptake of <b>isometamidium</b> chloride demonstrated Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics in all the populations, with Km values in the range 0. 35 - 0. 87 microM, and Vmax varied from 17 to 216 pmol/min per 10 (8) cells. The magnitude of Vmax was correlated with sensitivity to the drug. In contrast, no correlation was observed between Km values and drug sensitivity. Pulse-chase experiments indicated two compartments for accumulation of drug. The first consists of freely diffusible drug that is invariant between populations; the other consists of retained <b>isometamidium,</b> which is of variable magnitude between the populations and is correlated with drug sensitivity. Autoradiography and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated initial, rapid accumulation of the drug within the mitochondrion, specifically the kinetoplast. In a drug-sensitive population of T. congolense, agents affecting mitochondrial function were shown to produce dose-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsimito), as measured by the accumulation of the lipophilic cations [3 H]methyltriphenylphosphonium iodide or rhodamine 123. The agents also produced parallel inhibition of <b>isometamidium</b> uptake, suggesting an involvement of DeltaPsimito in the accumulation of the drug. When characterized {{in each of the four}} populations, the spontaneous DeltaPsimito was shown to be characteristic of each population and was correlated with Vmax for drug uptake and sensitivity to the drug in vitro and in vivo. We therefore conclude that in T. congolense DeltaPsimito is an important determinant of the rate and accumulation of the trypanocide <b>isometamidium</b> chloride. Populations of this trypanosome species vary with respect to DeltaPsimito, which is correlated with sensitivity to <b>isometamidium.</b> We suggest that when exposed to drug, the selection of such populations represents a novel mechanism of drug resistance in protozoan parasites...|$|E
40|$|<b>Isometamidium</b> {{chloride}} (Samorin Trypamidium), diminazene aceturate (Berenil, Veriben), homidium chloride (Novidium), {{homidium bromide}} (Ethidium) and the salts of quinapyramine (Trypacide, Triquin) are all anti-trypanosomal compounds that are routinely used in domestic livestock. However, the salts of quinapyramine {{are restricted to}} use in horses and camels. All four compounds {{have been used in}} the field for at least 35 years and the incidence of resistance to each compound appears to be increasing. Furthermore, in some instances, multiple-drug resistance has been Reported and is a particular threat to livestock production. Because <b>isometamidium,</b> homidium, diminazene and quinapyramine are chemically closely related, cross-resistance has been suggested to occur between a number of these compounds and may therefore contribute to the multiple-drug resistance phenotypes observed in the field. However a clear definition of the cross-resistance relationships has not been possible {{due to the lack of}} trypanosome populations in which resistance to individual trypanocides has been unequivocally induced. Trypanosoma congolense IL 1180 is a cloned population that expressed a high level of sensitivity to <b>isometamidium</b> chloride, quinapyramine sulphate, homidium chloride and diminazene aceturate; the dose required to cure 50 percent of infected mice (CD 50 value) are 0. 018 mg/kg body weight (b. w.), 0. 23 mg/kg b. w., 0. 37 mg/kg b. w. and 2. 3 mg/kg b. w., respectively. In the work described here repeated subcurative treatment of infected Swiss white mice with either <b>isometamidium</b> chloride (Samorin) or quinapyramine sulphate (Trypacide) was used to independently increase the resistance of T. congolense IL 1180 to these two compounds. In the first experiment the resistance of T. congolense IL 1180 to <b>isometamidium</b> was increased to a CD 50 of 1. 7 mg/kg b. w. over an 11 -month period of drug selection to produce a population designated t. congolense IL 3343. Trypanosoma congolense IL 3341 and T. congolense IL 3342 were intermediate populations produced after 5 and 7 months drug selection, respectively. In order to determine whether Development of resistance to <b>isometamidium</b> resulted in cross-resistance to other anti-trypanosomal compounds, T. congolense IL 3343 was characterised in mice for its sensitivity to diminazene aceturate, homidium chloride and quinapyramine sulphate and had CD 50 values of 7. 8 mg/kg b. w., 12. 1 mg/kg b. w., respectively. Thus, a 94 -fold increase in resistance to <b>isometamidium</b> chloride was associated with a 3 -fold increase in resistance to diminazene, a 33 -fold increase in resistance to homidium, and a 4 -fold increase in resistance to quinapyramine. Values for T. congolense IL 3341 and T. congolense IL 3342 were intermediate between those of T. congolense IL 1180 and T. congolense IL 3343. In a second study, resistance to quinapyramine sulphate was induced in T. congolense IL 1180 over a 7 -month period of drug selection, resulting in a population designated T. congolense IL 1180 /Stabilate 12. This population had a quinapyramine sulphate CD 50 of > 9. 6 mg/kg b. w., and diminazene aceturate, homidium chloride and <b>isometamidium</b> chloride CD 50 values of 12. 7 mg/kg b. w., 10. g mg/kg b. w. and 0. 10 mg/kg b. w., respectively (Table 2). Thus, an approximately 40 -fold increase in resistance to quinapyramine was associated with a 6 -fold increase in resistance to <b>isometamidium,</b> 1 28 -fold increase in resistance to homidium and a 6 -fold increase in resistance to diminazene. In summary, these data indicate that Development of resistance to <b>isometamidium</b> in T. congolense IL 1180 was associated with a high level of cross-resistance to homidium, but low levels of cross-resistance to diminazene and quinapyramine. In contrast, the present data and those from goats indicate that Development of resistance to quinapyramine in the same trypanosome clone was associated with relatively high levels of cross-resistance to <b>isometamidium,</b> homidium and diminazene. These data therefore confirm the rationale for using <b>isometamidium</b> and diminazene as a "sanative" combination, and indicate that the use of quinapyramine in cattle, sheep and goats is contra-indicated since Development of resistance to the compound results in relatively high levels of cross-resistance to all three anti-trypanosomal compounds recommended for use in these livestock species. Finally, since resistance to diminazene is difficult to induce experimentally with diminazene, and such resistance usually occurs in the field as part of a multiple-resistance phenotype (Peregrine, 1994) ...|$|E

Various workers have demonstrated that the molecule interferes with DNA polymerases purine nucleotide synthesis polyamine metabolism and mitochondrial type II topoisomerase. However, the contribution of such activities to the compound's anti-trypanosomal activity in vivo is not known. In the work presented here we describe the production and characterisation of a set of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that were raised against <b>isometamidium.</b> Such reagents constitute a potential tool for determining the site of action of <b>isometamidium</b> within trypanosomes. Two drug conjugates were synthesised for this work; an isometamidium-human serum albumin (HSA) conjugate was prepared as described by Kinabo and Bogan (1988).

40|$|<b>Isometamidium</b> {{chloride}} {{has remained}} a very important prophylactic and therapeutic drug against trypanosomosis in cattle since its introduction into {{the market in the}} 1950 s with, unfortunately, a concomitant development of resistance in trypanosomosis endemic areas. Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) was used to compare two isogenic clones of Trypanosoma congolense. The parent clone, sensitive to <b>isometamidium,</b> has a CD 50 (the curative dose that gives complete cure in 50 % of the animals) in the mouse of 0. 018 mg/kg and its derivative exposed to increasing doses of <b>isometamidium,</b> has a CD 50 that is 94 -fold higher. Sixty-four combinations of eight Eco RI and eight Mse I primers were used in comparative AFLP analysis to detect subtle genetic differences between the two clones. Thirty-five polymorphic fragments of DNA that were observed only in the resistant clone were purified and then sequenced. The nucleotide sequences were used in searching the GeneDB T. congolense database to find surrounding sequences upstream of an open reading frame and downstream to a stop codon. The sequences of the open reading frames were subsequently compared to the sequences in the genomic databases. A predicted gene coding for an 854 amino acids protein was thus identified. The protein contains a putative ATP binding site, Walker B and LSGG motifs and eight predicted trans-membrane domains. The gene in the resistant strain of T. congolense has a triplet insertion coding for an extra lysine. Using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, the insertion was sought in the genomes of 35 T. congolense strains isolated from different geographic origins and whose response to <b>isometamidium</b> chloride had been determined through single dose mouse tests. The presence of the insertion, specifying an extra codon was found to always be present in the genomes of T. congolense clones that were resistant to <b>isometamidium</b> chloride...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to provide a}} picture of the {{trypanosomosis}} and drug resistance prevalence in Eastern Province of Zambia, to understand the underlying factors of drug resistance (drug use habits), to improve the diagnosis of trypanosomosis in livestock and finally, to improve the diagnosis of <b>isometamidium</b> resistance in T. congolense. After an introductory part where available trypanosomosis and trypanocide resistance diagnostic methods are described and discussed, the body of the thesis is divided in two main sections. In the first section are presented the results of a cross-sectional and a longitudinal epidemiological survey describing the geographical distribution of trypanosomosis cases, of resistant isolates and of cattle treated with <b>isometamidium</b> chloride. The results of the monitoring of unsupervised treatments of cattle with <b>isometamidium</b> by farmers and veterinary assistants with the Isometamidium-ELISA technique are also presented. The second section describes the development of two new diagnostic methods, the first one allowing the diagnosis of trypanosome infections with high sensitivity and specificity through semi-nested polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. This is the first report of a pan-trypanosome PCR test (a single PCR test for the diagnosis of all important pathogenic trypanosomes of cattle). The second new method that was developed allows the diagnosis of <b>isometamidium</b> resistant T. congolense strains by PCR-RFLP. This is the first report of a PCR based diagnostic test of trypanocide resistance in T. congolense. Doctorat en sciences, Spécialisation biologie moléculaireinfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E

In {{order to assess}} the efficiency of two trypanocidal drugs (<b>isometamidium</b> chloride and diminazene) on cattle, a longitudinal study was conducted from September to November 2011 in the research station of Avetonou located in the Prefecture of Agou in Togo. A parasitological survey was carried out on two groups of 90 cattle each (for a total of 180 cattle) using the buffy coat technique at regular intervals of two weeks over a total period of 56 days.

The comparison of the incidence of trypanosomosis between the two groups was performed using three statistical tests: the Chi-squared test, the test of risk Reduction, and the “Eisler ratio test”.

40|$|Kinetoplastid parasites cause lethal {{diseases}} in humans and animals. The kinetoplast itself contains the mitochondrial genome, comprising a huge, complex DNA network {{that is also}} an important drug target. <b>Isometamidium,</b> for example, is a key veterinary drug that accumulates in the kinetoplast in African trypanosomes. Kinetoplast independence and <b>isometamidium</b> resistance are observed where certain mutations in the F 1 -γ-subunit of the two-sector F 1 Fo-ATP synthase allow for Fo-independent generation of a mitochondrial membrane potential. To further explore kinetoplast biology and drug resistance, we screened a genome-scale RNA interference library in African trypanosomes for <b>isometamidium</b> resistance mechanisms. Our screen identified 14 V-ATPase subunits and all 4 adaptin- 3 subunits, implicating acidic compartment defects in resistance; V-ATPase acidifies lysosomes and related organelles, whereas adaptin- 3 is responsible for trafficking among these organelles. Independent strains with depleted V-ATPase or adaptin- 3 subunits were <b>isometamidium</b> resistant, and chemical inhibition of the V-ATPase phenocopied this effect. While drug accumulation in the kinetoplast continued after V-ATPase subunit depletion, acriflavine-induced kinetoplast loss was specifically tolerated in these cells and in cells depleted for adaptin- 3 or endoplasmic reticulum membrane complex subunits, also identified in our screen. Consistent with kinetoplast dispensability, V-ATPase defective cells were oligomycin resistant, suggesting ATP synthase uncoupling and bypass of the normal Fo-A 6 -subunit requirement; this subunit is the only kinetoplast-encoded product ultimately required for viability in bloodstream-form trypanosomes. Thus, we describe 30 genes and 3 protein complexes associated with kinetoplast-dependent growth. Mutations affecting these genes could explain natural cases of dyskinetoplasty and multidrug resistance. Our results also reveal potentially conserved communication between the compartmentalized two-sector rotary ATPases...|$|E

Whole blood was collected from pigs kept in two disease endemic areas, with riverine and open savannah environments. The prevalence of trypanosomiasis was recorded at 8. 1 % in the riverine environment as compared to the 2. 1 % in the open savannah environment and the infections in the former were significantly higher (P < 0. 001). All pigs that received a treatment of <b>isometamidium</b> chloride (Samorin®) at 1 mg/kg body weight did not show relapse when followed up to one month post treatment using microscopy. However, relapses were recorded among pigs treated with diminazene aceturate (Berenil®) at a dose rate of 7 mg/kg body weight and no relapses were recorded in those treated with 14 mg/kg body weight. From this investigation, it is apparent that the trypanosome prevalence among pigs kept under the riverine environment is higher than those kept under the open savannah. In addition, 1 mg/kg and 14 mg/kg <b>isometamidium</b> chloride and diminazene aceturate respectively should be adopted for the treatment of trypanosome infections among the pigs in the trypanosomiasis endemic areas...|$|E

The isolates, T. b. rhodesiense KETRI 237, 2538, 1992, 2709, 2694 and 3530, had been obtained from sleeping sickness patients in Kenya and Uganda between 1960 and 1985. Five groups consisting of six mice each were inoculated intraperitoneally with 105 parasites of each isolate, and 24 h later treated with either melarsoprol, homidium chloride, diminazene aceturate or <b>isometamidium</b> chloride. The control group comprised infected but untreated mice. The mice were monitored for cure {{for a period of}} 60 days post-treatment. The mean prepatent period in the control mice was 5 days while the mean survival period was 22 days. Five of the stabilates, KETRI 237, 2538, 2709, 2694, and 3530, were confirmed to be melarsoprol resistant. Cross-resistance was observed, with the majority of the isolates being resistant to homidium chloride (5 / 6) and diminazene aceturate (5 / 6), but all were sensitive to <b>isometamidium</b> chloride (6 / 6). However T. b. rhodesiense KETRI 1992, which was previously considered as melarsoprol resistant, was sensitive to all the drugs tested.

40|$|Bovine {{trypanosomosis}} is {{a serious}} constraint to livestock development in large parts of Mozambique. In most areas where tsetse flies are present, the disease in livestock is controlled using curative and prophylactic trypanocidal drugs. Those drugs {{have been used for}} many years and new drugs are unlikely to become available in the near future. As a result, trypanosomes have developed resistance against the currently available trypanocidal compounds. Drug resistance has been detected in various African countries and {{is a serious}} impediment to the control of livestock trypanosomosis. A study was initiated to determine whether drug resistant trypanosome strains are present in Zambézia Province of Mozambique. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the sensitivity of Trypanosoma congolense isolates from Chinde, Nicoadala and Maganja da Costa Districts to diminazene aceturate, <b>isometamidium</b> chloride and homidium chloride. To assess the effect of the farming system and the intensity of drug regimens on the development of drug resistance, trypanosome isolates were collected from cattle from subsistence, semisubsistence and commercial livestock production systems. Drug-use practices in each of the production systems were determined using a questionnaire. The methodology used to assess the level of drugs resistance in the trypanosome isolates was the standardized method described by Eisler et al. (2001). Seven isolates were selected for resistance testing. For each of the seven isolates, five different doses varying between 0. 01 - 20 mg/kg body weight for <b>isometamidium</b> chloride, 0. 01 - 10 mg/kg body weight for homidium chloride and 1 - 30 mg/kg body weight for diminazene aceturate were used. For each dose rate six mice were treated intraperitoneally with the appropriate quantity of the drug dissolved in 0. 2 ml of sterile distilled water 24 hours after the inoculation of the blood containing the trypanosomes. The control mice (six mice per trypanocidal drug) received the same amount of water without the drug. In four of the seven isolates high levels of multiple drug resistance (diminazene aceturate and <b>isometamidium</b> chloride) were detected. One isolate had a low level of multiple (diminazene aceturate and <b>isometamidium</b> chloride) drug resistance. Two isolates were susceptible to both diminazene aceturate and <b>isometamidium</b> chloride. One of those was highly susceptible to <b>isometamidium</b> chloride even at the lowest dose rate. The observed levels of drug resistance could in most cases be correlated to the drug-use practices in the particular livestock production system. The results obtained from homidium chloride treatment are not conclusive, because most the mice cured after receiving 10 mg/kg body weight of the drug. Hence more research is required to establish the homidium threshold in mice. The results of this study should be useful to define the strategy of disease control in places where resistance of trypanocide were been reported.
