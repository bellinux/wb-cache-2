The present in vitro studies on isolated perfused rabbit proximal convoluted tubules were designed to examine whether protein concentration gradient must act across the peritubular capillary membrane to influence reabsorption, or whether it can exert a direct effect across the tubular basement membrane 71 proximal tubules were perfused with ultrafiltrate made isosmolal to bathing fluids, the latter having identical electrolyte composition as the perfusing ultrafiltrate, but adjusted to three oncotic pressures: hypooncotic, protein 0. 0 g/ 100 ml; control <b>isooncotic</b> serum, protein 6. 4 g/ 100 ml; and hyperoncotic, protein 12. 5 g/ 100 ml. Net volume flux (nl/mm per min), net Na flux (nEq/mm per min), unidirectional Na flux from bath to lumen (nEq/mm per min), and passive permeability coefficient (× 10 - 5 cm/sec) for Na (PNa), urea (Purea), and sucrose (Psucrose) were determined using isotopic techniques. When the bath was hypooncotic, there was (as compared with <b>isooncotic</b> serum) a significant decrease in net volume (38 %) and net sodium (40 %) flux, but no change in PNa, Purea, or transtubular potential; however, Psucrose increased significantly (78 %).

General physiological knowledge and clinical experience, however, suggest otherwise...|$|E
30|$|Under {{physiologic}} conditions, albumin is {{the molecule}} mainly accountable for intravascular osmotic pressure {{and should be}} an ideal colloid to restore protein loss from the vasculature. However, as a natural colloid, albumin may cause severe allergic reaction and immunologic complications. Current date concerning albumin use to treat hypovolemia mainly originate from critically ill patients. A Cochrane review of 30 randomized, controlled trials, including 1, 419 patients with hypovolemia, showed no evidence for a reduced mortality comparing albumin to crystalloid volume resuscitation. Usage of albumin may contrariwise even increase mortality [38]. More recently, the SAFE Study, including 6, 997 patients and comparing albumin to normal saline fluid resuscitation, found neither beneficial effects nor an increased mortality in the albumin group. Additionally, no differences in days of mechanical ventilation or need for renal-replacement therapy were observed [39]. In contrast to <b>isooncotic</b> albumin, which does not influence the outcome of critically ill patients, treatment with hyperoncotic albumin increased mortality [40]. Therefore, administration of <b>isooncotic</b> albumin may be justifiable in particular cases but not as a routine strategy for volume resuscitation.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY We {{determined}} the contributibn of the dorsal roots, vagi, and gino-aortic nerves to the renal responses to acute isotonic, <b>isooncotic</b> intravascular volume {{expansion in the}} nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis. Expansion of the estimated blood volume by 15 % produced a significant natriuresis and diuresis. There {{was no significant difference}} between the time to peak response for either. Neither dorsal rhizotomy (Ca-T 7) nor vagotomy and sino-aortic denervation had a significant effect on these responses. We conclude that these pathways are not necessary for eliciting the renal responses to hypervolemia in the nonhuman primate. Ore Res 45 : 95 - 99, 1979 ALTHOUGH there has been a number of studies concerning the contribution of neural pathways to salt and water homeostasis in the dog, little data are available for the primate. However, even in the dog, there is disagreement as to whether cardiopul-monary and/or spinal pathways are necessary for, or contribute to, the renal responses observed when blood volume is altered (Gauer and Henry, 1976...|$|E
40|$|A {{recombinant}} 130 kDa dihemoglobin {{which is}} made up of a single-chain tetra-α globin and four β globins has been expressed as a soluble protein in E. coli. The sequence of the single chain tetra-α is: αI-Gly-αII-(SerGlyGly) 5 Ser-αIII-Gly-αIV. This dihemoglobin has been purified and characterized in vitro by size exclusion chromatography, electrospray mass spectroscopy, equilibrium oxygen binding, and analytical ultracentrifugation. The observed values of P 50  and nmax for the dihemoglobin are slightly lower than those observed for the recombinant hemoglobin rHb 1. 1 (a “monohemoglobin” comprised of two β globins and an αI-Gly-αII diα-globin chain). Titration of the deoxy form of dihemoglobin with CO shows that all eight heme centers bind ligand. In vivo, dihemoglobin showed increased circulating halflife and a reduced pressor response in conscious rats when compared to rHb 1. 1. These observations suggest that dihemoglobin is an oxygen carrying molecule with desirable in vivo properties and provides a platform for an <b>isooncotic</b> hemoglobin solution derived solely from a recombinant source. A 260 kDa tetrahemoglobin has also been produced by chemical crosslinking of a dihemoglobin that contains a Lys 16 Cys mutation in the C-terminal α-globin subunit.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Perioperative fluid {{management}} influences patient outcome. Vascular surgery unites various surgical procedures, mainly {{with a high}} impact on patients who often have relevant preexisting illnesses. There are only scarce data on this specialty, forcing the clinician to extrapolate existing data when planning perioperative fluid management. This review aims to summarize the underlying facts. Recent findings Perioperative insensible perspiration does not exceed 1 ml/kg per hour. A third space shift does not exist; therefore, its primary substitution is erroneous. Rather, a crystalloid fluid excess causes a tremendous shift towards the interstitial space. Colloidal volume effects are context sensitive, that is, only their use as a substitute when blood or plasma loss occurs leads to maintenance within the circulatory space, Colloidal hypervolaemia and surgical trauma both {{have the potential to}} deteriorate the vascular barrier, leading to plasma loss into the interstitial space. Current perioperative fluid therapy should aim to maintain normovolaemia of the individual body fluid compartments as far as possible. This might be achieved by combining a protocol-based replacement of extracellular losses (urinary output plus insensible perspiration) with isotonic balanced crystalloids and blood volume optimization using <b>isooncotic</b> colloids. Summary The basis of fluid therapy in vascular surgery is a careful differential indication of the respective classes of preparations. A goal-directed approach might help to avoid hypovolaemi...|$|E
40|$|Disruption of the {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (ANP) {{receptor}} [guanylyl cyclase-A (GC-A) ] gene yields mice with a salt-resistant form of hypertension, raising {{fundamental questions}} {{on the role of}} ANP in acute regulation of the kidney. Here, we show that water intake, food consumption, stool weight, urine volume, and sodium excretion are not significantly different between wild-type and GC-A null mice on standard rodent chow (0. 7 % NaCl) or a high-salt diet (8 % NaCl). In conscious mice with an indwelling catheter, the infusion of a physiological saline solution containing 4 % BSA resulted in a marked natriuresis/diuresis in wild-type mice but no response in GC-A null animals. When physiological saline was given by gavage, however, the kidney response of wild-type and null mice was equivalent, raising the possibility that the gastrointestinal tract can directly regulate kidney function. However, administration of 0. 9 % saline through an intraperitoneal route also resulted in equal kidney responses in wild-type and null mice. When 0. 9 % NaCl lacking protein was infused i. v., wild-type and null mice both responded at the kidney level. Thus, GC-A appears dispensable for regulation of sodium/water excretion in response to changes in dietary sodium concentration, but likely becomes critical in volume expansions where the <b>isooncotic</b> pressure remains constant, such as head-out immersion or the initial and correctable stages of congestive heart failure...|$|E
40|$|In the {{perioperative}} period, artificial colloids {{are most}} often infused in doses of 500 - 1000 mL intravenously. This randomized study compared the effects on intravascular volume and coagulation of approximately 2000 mL of two <b>isooncotic</b> artificial colloids: 6 % hydroxyethyl starch (HES; MW 200, 000; substitution ratio 0. 40 - 0. 55) and 3 % modified fluid gelatin (GEL). We hypothesized more pronounced hypocoagulation with HES and a weaker intravascular volume effect of GEL. Forty-two patients, scheduled for primary total hip replacement, were allocated randomly to receive HES or GEL during acute normovolemic hemodilution and subsequent further intraoperative hemodilution. Blood samples were taken before and after 500 mL and 1000 mL of acute normovolemic hemodilution; intraoperatively after 20 mL/kg of artificial colloid {{and at the end}} of colloid infusion; on arrival in the recovery room; and 3 h later.

40|$|Introduction Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) -based volume {{replacement}} {{solutions are}} currently {{the most frequently}} used artificial colloids. Adverse drug reactions of HES are HES-induced coagulopathy that includes disturbed fibrin polymerization and impaired platelet function, as well as an acquired HES-induced von-Willebrand-like syndrome type 1. Changes of HES formulas relating to molecular weight, degree of substitution and concentration could decrease the impairment of coagulation. Modern HES preparations are of middle molecular weight, low substituted, and mainly <b>isooncotic.</b> Older hyperoncotic HES were associated with improved haemodynamics and oxygen transport, but also with higher impairment of coagulation. Introduction of electrolyte-balanced carrier solutions substituting the classic carrier solution of 0. 9 % sodium chloride attenuated the metabolic disturbances; a benefit concerning the coagulopathy is controversially discussed in the literature. The aim of the study presented was a systematic analysis of the in vitro effect on coagulation that is exerted by concentration and carrier solution of modern, middle molecular weight, low substituted HES in an in vitro model of stepwise increasing haemodilution. Besides, the in vitro reproducibility of blood group dependence of HES-induced, acquired von-Willebrand-like syndrome type 1 was investigated. Materials and Methods Both iso- and hyperoncotic, non-balanced and electrolyte-balanced HES solutions of identical molecular weight (MW 130, 000 Da) and comparable degree of substitution (DS 0. 4 or 0. 42, respectively) were investigated in an in vitro model of haemodilution. Citrated blood was obtained from 10 healthy volunteers of blood groups 0 or A, and the effect of 20 %, 40 % and 60 % haemodilution was measured by conventional coagulation parameters, by von-Willebrand-parameters and by dynamic coagulation parameters of activated thromboelastometry. As conventional coagulation parameters a full blood count, measurement of ionized calcium, prothrombin time ratio in percent (“Quick-value”), activated partial prothrombin time (aPTT), factor VIII (FVIII) as well as quantitative and qualitative assessment of von-Willebrand-Factor (vWF) was performed. In thromboelastometry, parameters CT, CFT and MCF of the EXTEM assay, and MCF of the FIBTEM assay were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric tests. Results Concerning the effect of the concentration of HES, in this study at some dilutional degrees higher Quick-value and FVIII, and lower aPTT, respectively, were measured after dilution with hyperoncotic HES. No benefit could be demonstrated concerning the von-Willebrand-Factor parameters by hyperoncotic HES formulas. In thromboelastometry a higher impairment of coagulation by hyperoncotic HES was seen. Concerning the effect of the carrier solution, in conventional coagulation parameters significantly higher levels of ionized calcium, less impaired Quick- and aPTT-values as well as higher FVIII levels were found after dilution with electrolyte-balanced HES. Neither could a benefit of electrolyte-balanced HES on the von-Willebrand-Factor parameters be demonstrated, nor could the benefit on thromboelastometry, that had been described in previous studies, be reproduced. With regard to the levels of vWF, the associated FVIII, and the functional activity of vWF, blood group 0 had lower values compared to blood group A, at baseline and during stepwise haemodilution. This is in line with the existing literature. Considering the physiologically lower baseline levels, a higher extent of impairment for blood group 0 by modern HES could not be demonstrated by quantitative assessments, although a higher extent of functional impairment could not be excluded. Discussion and conclusion There is a discrepancy between the observed effects of higher concentrated HES that impaired conventional coagulation parameters to a lesser, but thromboelastometry parameters to a higher degree than <b>isooncotic</b> HES. This discrepancy is in line with previous studies, and can be due to an in vitro measurement artifact by turbidimetric measurements. In case of turbidimetric measurements of coagulation parameters, i. e. optical measurements, colloids like HES can cause falsely-elevated readings, so mechanical measurements may be a favorable alternative. Given the lack of valid in vivo data and considering the higher impairment of coagulation demonstrated by thromboelastometry, high-volume resuscitation using a hyperoncotic HES should be restrictively applied. The discussion on potential benefits of electrolyte-balanced carrier solutions in HES-induced dilutional coagulopathy, that had been controversial before, was amended by a significant impact on ionized calcium and calcium-dependent coagulation parameters, e. g. Quick-value, aPTT, FVIII and von-Willebrand-factor parameters, in vitro. As measured by thromboelastometry, HES-induced coagulopathy did not differ between balanced and non-balanced carrier solution. In conclusion, this in vitro study cannot confirm a benefit of electrolyte-balanced carrier solutions on the coagulation system. To test the hypothesis of an in vitro artifact and for clarity concerning the impact of calcium-containing carrier solutions on levels of ionized calcium in vivo – with functioning calcium homeostasis – clinical studies investigating levels of ionized calcium and FVIII are needed...|$|E
