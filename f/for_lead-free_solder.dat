The movement has been triggered by the European Union’s (EU) proposal for a Directive on Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and by the Japanese focus on environmental marketing. The candidate solder alloys that {{have been identified as}} substi-tutes require high soldering temperatures since these alloys have typical melting temperatures between 198 °C and 227 °C. Concern has been raised that the higher processing temperatures required for wave and reflow soldering with these alloys will cre-ate increased drop out due to printed wiring board (PWB) warpage and component failures, since most components are not qualified in terms of reliability for these higher processing tem-peratures.

40|$|Solder joint {{strength}} at high strain {{rates is}} a critical reliability requirement for portable electronic devices. Experimental observations showed low shear rate tests of solder joints cannot be used to accurately predict the mode of deformation and failure behaviors under high speed impact condition. Due to strain rate effect, brittle failure of solder joints under dynamic loadings may not take place at low strain rates. Thus, characterization of solder joints under impact becomes critical in package design and manufacturing for high reliability.

In addition to solder material properties, many other factors, including package locations on the PCB, boundary conditions, input-G level, PCB thickness and solder materials, were also simulated to investigate their effects on stress strain performance of solder joint. Comparing to clamped boundary, the 4 -screw support condition leads to higher stress level in solder joint.

40|$|The under bump {{metallurgy}} (UBM) {{structure is}} {{a critical component of}} any solder interconnect system. The UBM typically provides three functions: adhesion to underlying dielectric and metal, barrier to protect the silicon circuitry, and a solder wettable surface. <b>For</b> <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> bumps, the barrier layer is key to reliability due to their higher Sn content. A common barrier layer used in the industry is electroplated nickel. This layer provides good protection from degradation of the silicon metallurgy by tin rich lead free solders. Controlled Collapse Chip Connection - New Process (C 4 NP) provides an opportunity to eliminate electroplating, and its associated costs for plating chemistry, analysis, supply and waste treatment. This paper analyzes electroless Ni/immersion Au (ENIG), with and without Pd, as an alternative UBM structure. Wafers were fabricated with these UBM structures, solder applied with C 4 NP, and chip level stressing performed to determine the robustne ss of these alternative stack-ups.

40|$|Multilayer ceramic {{capacitors}} (MLCCs) {{are known}} to be susceptible to cracking when subjected to excessive printed circuit board (PCB) flexure, which is called "flex cracking". The bending of the printed circuit board causes stresses to be transmitted through the solder fillets to the surface mount capacitors. These stresses are the highest {{at the bottom of the}} capacitor, where the termination bands end. In order to reduce the amount of stress that is transmitted to the brittle ceramic body of MLCCs through end terminations, a flexible termination system which incorporates a silver-loaded epoxy in end-terminations was developed by some MLCC manufacturers. With the transition to lead-free materials in the electronics industry there is a concern that MLCCs assembled on PCBs with lead-free solder have different susceptibility to flex cracking than those assembled with eutectic tin-lead solder. In this study, the flex cracking of MLCCs assembled with lead-free solder (Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu) was compared with those assembled with eutectic tin-lead (Sn 37 Pb) solder and differences in the results were explained in terms of solder mechanical properties and solder solidification temperature. Tin-silver-copper lead-free solders and eutectic tin-lead solder have different mechanical properties, which affect the stresses that are transmitted to the ceramic body of the capacitor through the solder fillet. The higher solidification temperature <b>for</b> <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> leads to increased residual compressive stresses after the reflow cool-down process for MLCCs assembled with lead-free solder compared with those assembled with tin-lead solder. In this work, the effects of dielectric material, capacitor size, solder assembly process, solder material, and end-termination type on flex cracking of MLCCs were determined for MLCCs from different manufacturers. Since some flexible- and standard-termination MLCCs are made with precious metal electrodes (silver-palladium), there is a possibility of electrochemical silver migration under bias and humidity. In this study, the effects of temperature-humidity-bias on electrical parameters of flexible-termination MLCCs were characterized and compared with standard-termination MLCCs.

40|$|In the {{electronics}} industry, packaging {{is responsible to}} protect chip from atmosphere and provide the path for signal communication as well as thermal dissipation. The realization of these functions in a packaging system depends {{on the performance of}} interconnect materials. Any failure on the interconnect materials could make entire system down. Currently, {{one of the most popular}} interconnect materials is lead-free solder, which has been used for two decades instead of toxic Sn-Pb solder. The updates on processes, equipments and standards <b>for</b> <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> have been completed. However, as continuous increase on the chip power and the miniaturization of consumer electronics, lead-free solder is facing big challenges. The disadvantages of traditional lead-free solder, such as high process temperature, grain coarsening and thermal fatigue failure, are gradually exposed. Therefore, one of the urgent needs for packaging is to develop new interconnect materials. In recent years, as the development of nanotechnology, nanostructured materials are gradually applied on the packaging. Following this tendency, two promising nanostructured interconnect materials are presented in this thesis. The first part of this thesis shows a nanocomposite material. It consists of Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu nanoparticles and Sn- 58 Bi solder matrix. Sn- 58 Bi solder has the advantage on low process temperature. However the inherent brittleness of Sn- 58 Bi limits its application. For this reason, the Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu nanoparticles are added into the Sn- 58 Bi in order to improve the mechanical properties. The result of shear test shows that the shear strength of Sn- 58 Bi increases by two times by the addition of Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu nanoparticles. The result also indicates that the nanocomposite solder has excellent thermal fatigue resistance. The demonstrated properties make nanocomposite solder can be a potential candidate for replacing Sn-Ag-Cu in future. In this thesis, we also present another kind of interconnect material based on vertically aligned carbon nanofibers. High stability and compatibility of carbon nanofibers are always attractive to the packaging industry. By using a series of processes, such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, sputtering, transfer and bonding, the vertically aligned carbon nanofibers are successfully assembled in the packaging system. As interconnect material, vertically aligned carbon nanofibers exhibit acceptable electrical resistance and shear strength.
