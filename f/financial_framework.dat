2500|$|The legal {{proposals}} aim to {{move away}} from the different systems of the Single Payments Scheme in the EU-15 (which allows for historical references, or a payment per hectare, or a [...] "hybrid" [...] combination of the two) and the Single Area Payments Scheme (SAPS) in most of the EU-12, a new [...] "Basic Payment Scheme" [...] will apply after 2013. This will be subject to [...] "cross compliance" [...] (respecting certain environmental, animal welfare & other rules), as at present, although there are various simplifications to the current requirement. It intends to reduce significantly the discrepancies between the levels of payments obtained between farmers, between regions and between Member States. All Member States will be obliged to move towards a uniform payment per hectare at national or regional level by the start of 2019. In line with the Commission proposals within the Multi-Annual <b>Financial</b> <b>Framework,</b> the national envelopes for direct payments will be adjusted so that those that receive less than 90% of the EU average payment per hectare will receive more. The gap between the amounts currently foreseen and 90% of the EU-27 average is reduced by one-third.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1998 the Dutch {{government}} provided {{technical assistance}} to prepare a second national water plan. The National Water Resources Plan (NWRP) was completed in 2003 with a time horizon until 2017. The plan, which is not publicly available, is based on four principles: to develop additional resources, make better use of existing resources, protect {{public health and the}} environment, and improve institutional arrangements. According to the FAO the plan includes both [...] "vertical expansion" [...] through more efficient water use and increased agricultural productivity and [...] "horizontal expansion" [...] by increasing the existing agricultural area of 7.8 million feddan (about 3.12 million ha) by an additional 1.4 million feddan (about 560 000 ha). In June 2005 the Ministry presented an Integrated Water Resources Management Plan, which was prepared with technical assistance from the World Bank, as a [...] "transitional strategy including further reform interventions" [...] building on the NWRP. The Plan, which reads more like a World Bank report than a report by the Egyptian government, includes 39 actions in the fields of institutional reform and strengthening, policies and legislation, physical interventions, capacity building, technological and information systems, water quality, economic and <b>financial</b> <b>framework,</b> research, raising awareness, monitoring and evaluation and transboundary cooperation.

However, such a blueprint is rarely revised: it seems that only fundamental changes such as the privatization of JNR into JR can lead to such revision. Furthermore, these planning schemes originate {{from the time of the}} rapid economic growth – in other words, the scheme aims to fulfill the then rapidly increasing transport demand, or sometimes regional political or socioeconomic wishes.|$|R
