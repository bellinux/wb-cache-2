500|$|... "The Winds of Winter" [...] saw the {{departure}} of several cast members and recurring guest actors from the series. Notables included Dean-Charles Chapman, whose character, King Tommen Baratheon, committed suicide in the episode. Before appearing {{in the role of}} Tommen, which was originally portrayed by actor Callum Wharry, Chapman appeared in the third season of the series as Martyn Lannister, a minor character who was also killed off. Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding my own business, and I got a phone call. I picked up the phone, and instantly, I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b> It was David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two creators of the show, and they stated the facts. But they did it really nice. I couldn't have asked for a better way to have that news broken to me. Them telling me beforehand really helped me out, otherwise I would have been in a state when I read it in the scripts. I probably would have cried." ...|$|E

[...] Safety Marcus Griffin stuffed the play for an 11-yard loss. [...] Commenting on stopping the trick play, Griffin said, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> – we'd been beaten by that {{play in the}} last 10 games. We {{knew it had to}} come, I guess that was the best time for it." [...] Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz described the call as [...] "totally my fault. I was being greedy, I thought we had a secure play." ...|$|E

She goes back to help survivors, while Lexa and Clarke set off to find and kill the spotter who called in the strike. Clarke finds and kills the spotter with Lincoln's help, and realizes the spotter's lack of a hazmat suit means the Mountain Men have started {{harvesting}} her friends. Inside Mount Weather, Jasper (a friend of Clarke's) and the others fight back and find refuge with those in Mount Weather who do not agree with Wallace or Cage.|$|E

I would have given anything to have seen it--from a distance, you <b>know.</b> If <b>it</b> had <b>been</b> the right thing, I would have come and been your backer." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{shooting}} of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African American boy (June 25, 2002 – November 23, 2014), occurred on November 22, 2014, in Cleveland, Ohio. Two police officers, 26-year-old Timothy Loehmann and 46-year-old Frank Garmback, responded {{after receiving a}} police dispatch call of a black male that [...] "keeps pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at people". A caller reported that a male was pointing [...] "a pistol" [...] at random people in the Cudell Recreation Center. At {{the beginning of the}} call and again in the middle he says of the pistol [...] "it's probably fake". [...] Toward the end of the two-minute call, the caller stated [...] "he is probably a juvenile". However, this information was not relayed to Loehmann or Garmback on the initial dispatch. The officers reported that upon their arrival, they both continuously yelled [...] "show me your hands" [...] through the open patrol car window. [...] Loehmann further claimed that instead of showing his hands, it appeared as if Rice was trying to draw the replica: [...] "I knew it was a gun and I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> out". In response, the officer shot twice, hitting Rice once in the torso. He died on the following day.|$|E

60|$|How did Fanny <b>know</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming?</b> She did <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> {{though he}} had said nothing to her beyond his usual parish communications. He was often {{with her in the}} two schools; often {{returned}} with her in the sweet Spring evenings along the lane that led back to the rectory from Cumberly Green; often inspected with her the little amounts of parish charities and entries of pence collected from such parents as could pay. He had never reverted to that other subject. But yet Fanny <b>knew</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> and when she had questioned Harry about his troubles she had been thinking also of her own.|$|R
60|$|By {{the seventh}} round {{he was about}} all in, hanging on and panting and sobbing for breath in the clinches, and I knew I could put him out any time.

60|$|We had {{forgotten}} Don {{and suddenly he}} darted out of the thicket, straight up the slide. Always, in every chase, we were afraid the great hound would run to meet his death.

5000|$|Being {{asked about}} the storyline Miles said: [...] "A long time ago! Our late {{producer}} Gavin Blyth spoke to me about this in September (2010) last year. He was very cautious about it but very excited at the same time. So <b>it's</b> <b>been</b> {{quite a long time}} that I've <b>known</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> up. I think they referred to it for ages as the 'Jimmy Who?' story!" [...] also asked about his reaction to the storyline he commented: [...] "I was a bit like Gav, really - I was excited but also a little bit trepidatious. It's one of those topics that it's rare to do a story about. My main concern was that I did a decent amount of research and knew what I was doing." ...|$|R
60|$|The skipper hurried {{away with}} a serious face. A {{little more than a}} minute after he had left the cabin Lady Greendale heard the rattle of the blocks of the falls.

Pray as you never prayed before," [...] and again he {{stretched}} out his hand towards the whisky bottle. But I stepped between him and it, shaking my head. Thereon he laughed {{for the third time}} and left the cabin. Though I saw him once or twice afterwards, these were really the last words of intelligible conversation that I ever had with Captain Astley.|$|E
5000|$|Gillian Reynolds of The Daily Telegraph said Phil's {{death was}} [...] "beautifully done, in seven scenes, three {{intersecting}} plot lines and all in 13 minutes.

5000|$|... "We practised cornersfor hours, and it {{certainly}} paid off.

At {{the end of the game}} it was a huge feeling of relief that we had proved a point - we were good enough for promotion. We knew as a group of players we could play at a higher level and this gave us a chance to do so. I had a great time at Vale, and this was the greatest of them all.

She was informed of the outcome only while being led back to the holding cells, and was seen to stagger and almost fall with shock. She later declared that [...] "They're going to kill me.

60|$|At last, of course, the {{explosion}} happens.
