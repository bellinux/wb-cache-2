5|$|The present period began about 150,000years ago and {{involved}} {{the development of}} the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 11,000years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them.|$|E

Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fascinating}} phenomena of geophysics is the fact that in <b>the</b> geological <b>past</b> <b>the</b> Earth's magnetic field has frequently reversed its polarity.

The (changes in) reversal frequency <b>during</b> <b>the</b> geological <b>past</b> may tell us something about long-term changes in the lower mantle and outer-core processes, and hence constrain the origin of the field itself. The subject of this thesis, however, deals with an entirely different scale of time: that of individual polarity reversals, taking place in several thousands of years...|$|R
