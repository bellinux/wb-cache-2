However, Andrew Sanchez of Maximum PC praised the game's graphics {{and noted that}} the Dark Engine went [...] "feature-for-feature with the LithTech, Quake, and Unreal engines". He also praised the game's AI, sound and plot. Larka disliked the game's extremely dark areas, which required him to [...] "max out the gamma correction and set [...] monitor to its brightest setting <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> barest details" [...] but called the graphics [...] "seamless". Some reviews complained about collision detection issues.|$|E
500|$|Alan Tudyk as Hoban [...] "Wash" [...] Washburne– Serenity {{pilot and}} Zoe's husband. Deeply {{in love with}} his wife, Wash expresses jealousy over his wife's [...] "war buddy" [...] {{relationship}} and unconditional support of their captain, most particularly in the episode [...] "War Stories", in which he confronts Mal, even as they are being tortured by a dissatisfied customer. He joined pilot training <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> stars, which were invisible from the surface of his polluted homeworld, and he joined Serenity despite being highly sought after by other ships. He is very light-hearted and tends to make amusing comments, despite the severity of any situation.|$|E

500|$|Marcos strategists took {{advantage}} of [...] Imelda's exceptional charm and youth by incorporating these and her other striking qualities into the presidential candidate's overall tone for the Marcos-led Nacionalista campaign. They {{were able to use}} her by attracting normal folk from their daily activities to attend a Marcos rally to see the [...] "beautiful wife of Marcos" [...] themselves. The mere mention of Imelda attending a rally would make people attend the rally and scamper for a place near the stage, not to listen to the speeches, but rather <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> lovely wife of Ferdinand Marcos. She was asked by the Marcos aides to always appear in public at all times at her best regardless of the [...] type of audience. An integral part of their strategy was for Imelda to wear her standard ternos as part of the campaign design.|$|E
500|$|The Cockroaches' former manager, Jeremy Fabinyi, {{became the}} group's first manager. [...] Using their {{previous}} connections, he {{negotiated with the}} ABC to air their TV show {{and to help them}} promote their first recording. [...] The album cost approximately A$4,000 to produce and it sold 100,000 copies in 1991. [...] Field and Cook got teaching jobs, while Page finished his degree, so they could only perform during school holidays; finding time to do so was, as Field reported, [...] "challenging". [...] Fabinyi advised them to tour in unusual settings throughout Sydney and New South Wales. [...] The Wiggles' debut performance was at a friend's daycare facility in Randwick, for about a dozen children. They played for crowds at shopping centres like Westfield in Sydney and at small pre-school events and parties, and busked at Circular Quay, then moved on to regional tours and shows for playgroup associations, averaging about 300 people in the audience. [...] They were promoted by local playgroups or nursing mothers' associations with whom they split their proceeds. [...] They performed at pre-schools with other ABC children's performers; when 500 people attended these concerts <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>The</b> Wiggles, they started doing their own shows, and according to Field, [...] "Suddenly people started rolling up to performances in astonishing numbers".|$|E

During the finale of the tenth season of American Idol on May 25, 2011, the lady contestants joined {{together}} onstage to perform [...] "Single Ladies" [...] and attempted the dance moves from the song's video. [...] "Single Ladies" [...] was covered by The Chipettes in the film [...] {{and is on the}} [...] Their three-part harmonies were all sung by Janice Karman, who recorded all parts, which were then layered and pitched up. The Chipettes attempted the Bob Fosse-styled choreography. Billy Johnson of Yahoo! Music commented {{that for the first time}} the movie includes a performance he wanted to watch, and concluded, [...] "this is definitely one of the best 'Single Ladies' parodies. It is worth it <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> squirrels singing." [...] The film Sex and the City 2 features a performance of the song by American singer and actress Liza Minnelli. On October 18, 2011, Young Men Society sang [...] "Single Ladies" [...] on the third series of The X Factor Australia, and on June 30, 2014, Holly Tapp sang the song on the third series of The Voice Australia.|$|E

2500|$|Colin McDonald was {{captain of}} Victoria and an {{effective}} opener {{with a short}} backlift who had made centuries against South Africa and the West Indies and had stood up to Tyson in 1954-55. He made as fighting 32 and 89 in , but failed {{in the rest of}} the 1956 series. In 1958-59 McDonald's 519 runs (64.87) made him the first batsmen to top 500 runs in an Ashes series since Len Hutton in 1950-51 and the first Australian to do so since Don Bradman in 1948. His opening partner was Jim Burke a stonewaller who took 578 minutes to make 189 against South Africa in 1957-58 [...] and was the butt of the Sydney Hill barrackers; [...] "Burkey, you're so like a statue, I wish I were a pigeon" [...] He didn't make many runs in 1958-59 though he tended to hang around and retired at the end of the season rather than face the increasingly number of fast bowlers. Neil Harvey was Australia's premier batsmen after the retirement of Don Bradman, a left-handed strokemaker whose technique allowed him to make runs while other could hardly get bat to ball. Norm O'Neill made his debut in this series and was like a breath of fresh air in the stagnant cricket of the late 1950s. Athletic, good-looking and a positive strokemaker he was hailed as the [...] "New Bradman" [...] and a favourite with the crowds. Crowds flocked to his games <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Australian Hope" [...] and his striking 71 not out to win the First Test made a mockery of the England's funeral second innings. After Harvey and O'Neill came Ken Mackay sarcastically called [...] "Slasher Mackay" [...] as he rarely indulged in strokeplay, instead the ungainly Queenslander set about occupying the crease for as long a possible. He never made a Test century and only averaged 33.48, but always seemed to make runs when Australia was in trouble. Les Favell had a terrible time as an opener against Tyson and Statham in 1954-55, but was now a powerful middle-order batsman and crowd favourate who replaced Peter Burge after the First Test. Worth a mention is Bobby Simpson, a batting prodigy to match Norm O'Neill and an outstanding slip fielder, who made a duck in his only Test innings in the series, but was often 12th man and used as a substitute fielder. In the lower order were Richie Benaud and Alan Davidson, both hard-hitting all-rounders who liked to attack the bowling, but whose late order heroics were seldom needed.|$|E
