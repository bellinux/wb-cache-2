500|$|Despite the praise, {{the last}} third of the album was {{considered}} the weakest part and the song [...] "Ordinary Morning" [...] was considered a poor choice for a closer. Rolling Stone editor David Fricke also criticized the album for being underdeveloped and lacking originality, and unfavorably compared the song [...] "Hard to Make a Stand" [...] to [...] "Tumbling Dice" [...] by the Rolling Stones and [...] "Sweet Jane" [...] by the Velvet Underground.

Several tracks feature complex guitar solos, as noted by Chamberlain; one such solo, featured on the title track [...] "Get to Heaven", was originally recorded in a hotel room. Another, on the single [...] "Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread", makes heavy use of an MWFX Judder pedal. Robertshaw told Chamberlain that [...] " [...] is a bit of a signature for the new record...

500|$|Much of Fanning's {{writing is}} {{inspired}} by non-rock music, and [...] "My Happiness" [...] is no exception.
