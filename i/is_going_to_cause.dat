His entry for 29 September 1943 reads: [...] "Unfortunately we have had to give up Katyn. The Bolsheviks undoubtedly will soon 'find' that we shot 12,000 Polish officers.

He said, [...] "What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You want to play a catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. You know someone who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters.

And to start off by killing, crucifying etc. That is not correct at all." [...] In response to being asked what the difference between the Islamic Front's and ISIL's version of sharia would be, he said, [...] "One of their mistakes is before the regime has fallen, and before they've established what in Sharia is called Tamkeen , they started applying Sharia, thinking God gave them permission to control the land and establish a Caliphate. This goes against the beliefs of religious scholars around the world. This is what [...] did wrong. This <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> a lot of trouble.

2500|$|Transitions from a HS to a LS state cause a {{decrease}} in the bond distances between the metal center and the ligand. The {{decrease in the number of}} antibonding electrons also strengthens the metal-ligand bond in transitions from a HS to LS state. Because the HS and LS states differ with regard to metal-to-ligand bond distances, the harmonic approximation can be assumed. [...] The LS state will have the smaller equilibrium distance - meaning that it has the larger bond force constant, ωLS>ωHS, and the transitions must fall within the thermal energy, kBT [...] In addition, spin transitions are going to affect the vibrational modes of the ligands. A strong interaction between the metal and the ligand, as is the case of a LS state, <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> a shift of the electronic density to the metal causing a weakness of the interligand bonds, and therefore a red shift of their vibrational modes. [...] Figure 6 shows the FT-IR spectrum of an iron(II) cluster at different temperatures. [...] As the temperature decreases, the Fe-N bond distance decreases. Therefore, the CN stretching band shifts to higher frequencies and at higher temperatures, the CN stretching band increases in energy. In this figure, it is shown how the HS state CN stretching band at 2054cm−1 is predominant at higher temperatures and the LS state CN stretching band at 2099cm−1 is predominant at lower temperatures, in addition to the different mixed HS and LS state and the fading of this band as the temperatures change. The area under the curves of the absorption peaks for these two states are going to be proportional to the fraction of HS and LS states in the sample. Figure 7 shows a plot of the area under the curves of the absorption peaks as a function of temperature for the same iron cluster (vide supra), showing a large hysteresis loop.|$|E

40|$|However large a hand-crafted widecoverage grammar is, there <b>are</b> always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{words and}} constructions {{that are not}} {{included}} in it and <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> parse failure. Due to their heterogeneous and flexible nature, Multiword Expressions (MWEs) provide an endless source of parse failures. As the number of such expressions in a speaker’s lexicon is equiparable to the number of single word units (Jackendoff, 1997), one major challenge for robust natural language processing systems {{is to be able to}} deal with MWEs. In this paper we propose to semi-automatically detect MWE candidates in texts using some error mining techniques and validating them using a combination of the World Wide Web as a corpus and some statistical measures. For the remaining candidates possible lexicosyntactic types are predicted, and they are subsequently added to the grammar as new lexical entries. This approach provides a significant increase in the coverage of these expressions...|$|R
