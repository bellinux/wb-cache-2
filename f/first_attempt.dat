5|$|A Wizard of Earthsea {{was first}} {{published}} in 1968 by Parnassus Press in Berkeley, a year before The Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin's watershed work.

The book has been released in numerous editions, including an illustrated Folio Society edition released in 2015. It was also translated into a number of other languages.
