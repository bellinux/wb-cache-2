50|$|Each time Intel {{launched}} a new microprocessor, they simultaneously provided a System Development Kit (SDK) allowing engineers, university students, and others to familiarise themselves with the new processor's concepts and features. The SDK single-board computers allowed the user to enter object code from a keyboard or upload it through a communication port, and then test run the code. The SDK boards provided a system monitor ROM to operate the keyboard and other <b>interfaces.</b> <b>Kits</b> varied in their specific features but generally offered optional memory and interface configurations, a serial terminal link, audio cassette storage, EPROM program memory.

50|$|The XMC4000 Application Kit is a modular, {{extensible}} application board {{consisting of}} a CPU board {{in the center and}} 3 satellites, the so-called extension boards. Due to this construction, the kit can be functionally extended to certain target applications and customized. The three satellites include the automation I/O Kit, an Ethernet / CAN / RS-485 <b>Interface</b> <b>kit</b> and a standard human <b>interface</b> <b>kit.</b> The Human Interface Board also (HMI), in addition to the OLED display plus audio, a touch and SD / MMC function. The COM board allows developers to create a kind of remote control over Ethernet. This board also supports MultiCAN and RS-485 interfaces. In addition to these three satellites, it allows developers to connect their own boards.|$|E
50|$|In {{some other}} aspects, Haiku is already more {{advanced}} than BeOS. For example, the <b>interface</b> <b>kit</b> allows {{the use of a}} layout system to automatically place widgets in windows, while on BeOS the developer had to specify the exact position of each widget by hand. This allows for GUIs that will render correctly with any font size and makes localization of applications much easier, as a longer string in a translated language will make the widget grow, instead of being partly invisible if the widget size were fixed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{the age of}} {{automation}} we can’t {{be dependent}} totally on manual working of any mechanism, it leads mechanism to take much time with less accuracy. In case of analysis of four bar mechanism if we go by graphical method it {{will take at least}} one hour just for single position of crank and if we analyze it with computer interfacing, it can be done in very short time for different positions of crank with greater accuracy. For third year mechanical engineering students, there are two experiments based on analysis of four bar mechanism in order to construct velocity & acceleration diagram in Theory of Machine Lab, but at this moment they use to do this with graphical method in which they can’t visualize actual motion of different links for different mechanisms. Hence we have prepared such equipment, which will give outputs like angular velocity (w), angular acceleration (a), linear velocity (v), linear acceleration (a) for fraction movement of crank within few minutes and visualization of actual motion of links for different mechanism can be studied, such as 1. Crank-crank mechanism 2. Crank-rocker mechanism 3. Rocker-rocker mechanism 4. Slider crank mechanism And also we have made an arrangement for its manual working and by obtaining both the result of manual & computer outputs we can compare it and this equipment will also help in introducing the students with interfacing knowledge.

40|$|The Asteroid Redirect Crewed Mission (ARCM) {{requires}} a Launch/Entry/Abort (LEA) suit capability and short duration Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) capability from the Orion spacecraft. For this mission, the pressure garment that was selected, for both functions, is the Modified Advanced Crew Escape Suit (MACES) with EVA enhancements {{and the life}} support option that was selected is the Exploration Portable Life Support System (PLSS). The proposed architecture was found to meet the mission constraints, but much more work is required to determine {{the details of the}} required suit upgrades, the integration with the PLSS, {{and the rest of the}} tools and equipment required to accomplish the mission. This work has continued over the last year to better define the operations and hardware maturation of these systems. EVA simulations have been completed in the NBL and interfacing options have been prototyped and analyzed with testing planned for late 2014. For NBL EVA simulations, in 2013, components were procured to allow in-house build up for four new suits with mobility enhancements built into the arms. Boots outfitted with clips that fit into foot restraints have also been added to the suit and analyzed for possible loads. Major suit objectives accomplished this year in testing include: evaluation of mobility enhancements, ingress/egress of foot restraint, use of foot restraint for worksite stability, ingress/egress of Orion hatch with PLSS mockup, and testing with two crew members in the water at one time to evaluate the crew's ability to help one another. Major tool objectives accomplished this year include using various other methods for worksite stability, testing new methods for asteroid geologic sampling and improving the fidelity of the mockups and crew equipment. These tests were completed on a medium fidelity capsule mockup, asteroid vehicle mockup, and asteroid mockups that were more accurate for an asteroid type EVA than previous tests. Another focus was the design and fabrication of the interface between the MACES and the PLSS. The MACES was not designed to interface with a PLSS, hence an <b>interface</b> <b>kit</b> must accommodate the unique design qualities of the MACES and provide the necessary life support function connections to the PLSS. A prototype <b>interface</b> <b>kit</b> for MACES to PLSS has been designed and fabricated. Unmanned and manned testing of the interface will show the usability of the kit while wearing a MACES. The testing shows viability of the kit approach as well as the operations concept. The design will be vetted through suit and PLSS experts and, with the findings from the testing, the best path forward will be determined. As the Asteroid Redirect Mission matures, the suit/life support portion of the mission will mature along with it and EVA Tools & Equipment can be iterated to accommodate the overall mission objectives and compromises inherent in EVA Suit optimization. The goal of the EVA architecture for ARCM is to continue to build on the previously developed technologies and lessons learned, and accomplish the ARCM EVAs while providing a stepping stone to future missions and destinations...|$|E

Seven {{changes have been}} made to the LEXER and YACC code of PPL. Five of the changes are related to the syntax of policy rules in PPL. Two of the changes are related to the semantics of the language. A graphical user <b>interface</b> tool <b>kit</b> for creating, validating, archiving and compiling policies represented in PPL has been developed. The tool kit has a field-by-field interface that allows a policy maker to input and update PPL compliant policy rules, while hiding the subtle details of the PPL syntax from the user. Prior to the work reported here, policy files were created separately and the PPL compiler had to be invoked manually from a command line interface. The GUI combines the processes of forming a policy file and compiling. These processes are performed automatically from the menu items of the tool kit. The GUI itself is password protected, permitting only authorized users access to the system. Protection of the policy rules is also provided via the tool kit.

The participating teacher was trained by us and students had available <b>kits,</b> <b>interfaces</b> and computers equipped with 8051 micro chip programming tools. Student activities were video recorded and the analysis proceeded through writing video protocols,edited into episodes and then classified into categories. Categories were mainly derived empirically. In the analysis, we used concepts such as collaboration and problem solving,in accordance with social constructivism. The data showed that typical learning processes were collaborative (51 % of all episodes) as well as dynamic problem-solving processes, inseveral stages. Students worked quite independently of the teacher, as they learned to use the programming tool autonomously in their technology projects. It appears, however, that more teacher support, such as introducing handbooks, planning tools and advanced programming skills, {{would have been an}} advantage. And it also appears the non-group interations would provide help in the problem solving process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to cover the {{procedure}} of creating and explaining {{how to use a}} tool kit that allows the haptic Application Programming Interface (API) H 3 D from SenseGraphics to be used in conjunction with an advanced physics simulator from Meqon. Both haptic applications and physics engines have developed rapidly {{the last couple of years}} but they are rarely used together. If such a connection would be created it would be possible to interact with complex environments in a new way and a variety of haptic applications can be produced. The physics engine from Meqon has gained recognition for its abilities to produce realistic results due to efficient implementation of collision detection system, friction models and collision handling, among other things. H 3 D is a completely open source API that is based on standards such as OpenGL and X 3 D. H 3 D consists of a data base containing nodes, an XML parser to extract a scene graph from the data base and functionality to produce a graphic and haptic <b>interface.</b> The tool <b>kit</b> produced in this thesis is an extension to H 3 D. A fundamental function of the tool kit is to communicate with the Meqon system and still be a part of the H 3 D structure. The Meqon system has a modular structure where each module has its own abilities. Only the rigid body module is utilised by the tool kit, which however is the most important module. It is possible to define global settings of the engine and rigid body module, add rigid bodies with several elements and insert constraints on the motion of the rigid bodies into the engine. All of these operations are done from the X 3 D file format that H 3 D uses, thus letting all functionality of the H 3 D system available...|$|R
40|$|The Asteroid Redirect Crewed Mission (ARCM) {{requires}} a Launch/Entry/Abort (LEA) suit capability and short duration Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) capability for Orion. The EVAs will involve a two-person crew for approximately four hours. Currently, two EVAs are planned with one contingency EVA in reserve. Providing this EVA capability is very challenging due to system level constraints {{and a new}} and unknown environment. The goal of the EVA architecture for ARCM is one that builds upon previously developed technologies and lessons learned, and that accomplishes the ARCM mission while providing a stepping stone to future missions and destinations. The primary system level constraints are to 1) minimize system mass and volume and 2) minimize the interfacing impacts to the baseline Orion design. In order to minimize the interfacing impacts and to not perturb the baseline Orion schedule, the concept of adding "kits" to the baseline system is proposed. These kits consist of: an EVA kit (converts LEA suit to EVA suit), EVA Servicing and Recharge Kit (provides suit consumables), the EVA Tools, Translation Aids & Sample Container Kit (the tools and mobility aids to complete the tasks), the EVA Communications <b>Kit</b> (<b>interface</b> between the EVA radio and the MPCV), and the Cabin Repress Kit (represses the MPCV between EVAs). This paper {{will focus on the}} trade space, analysis, and testing regarding the space suit (pressure garment and life support system). Historical approaches and lessons learned from all past EVA operations were researched. Previous and current, successfully operated EVA hardware and high technology readiness level (TRL) hardware were evaluated, and a trade study was conducted for all possible pressure garment and life support options. Testing and analysis was conducted and a recommended EVA system architecture was proposed. Pressure garment options that were considered for this mission include the currently in-use ISS EVA Mobility Unit (EMU), all variations of the Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES), and the Exploration Z-suit. For this mission, the pressure garment that was selected is the Modified ACES (MACES) with EVA enhancements. Life support options that were considered included short closed-loop umbilicals, long open-loop umbilicals, the currently in-use ISS EMU Portable Life Support System (PLSS), and the currently in development Exploration PLSS. For this mission, the life support option that was selected is the Exploration PLSS. The greatest risk in the proposed architecture is viewed to be the comfort and mobility of the baseline MACES and the delicate balance between adding more mobility features while not compromising landing safety. Feasibility testing was accomplished in low fidelity analogs and in the JSC Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) to validate the concept before a final recommendation on the architecture was made. The proposed architecture was found to meet the mission constraints, but much more work is required to determine the details of the required suit upgrades, the integration with the PLSS, {{and the rest of the}} tools and equipment required to accomplish the mission.
