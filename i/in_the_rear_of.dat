5|$|Another major {{difference}} between Tarbosaurus and its North American relatives was its more rigid mandible (lower jaw). While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between the bones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the mandible and the dentary in the front, Tarbosaurus had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge {{on the surface of}} the angular, which articulated with a square process on the rear of the dentary.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, late on 13 February, having {{successfully}} regrouped what forces {{he could}} muster at Bergères-lès-Vertus, Blücher had launched {{an attack against}} Marmont's single division, pushing him out of Étoges and advancing as planned towards Champaubert and Fromentières, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> Napoleon's force. However, having read Blücher's intentions, Napoleon had given orders for a concentration of French forces in that very sector.|$|E

5|$|Around noon, Wallace {{began the}} journey along the Shunpike, a route {{familiar}} to his men. A member of Grant's staff, William R. Rowley, found Wallace between 2 and 2:30p.m. on the Shunpike, after Grant wondered where Wallace was {{and why he}} had not arrived on the battlefield, while the main Union force was being slowly pressed backward. Rowley told Wallace that the Union army had retreated, Sherman was no longer fighting at Shiloh Church, and the battle line had moved northeast toward Pittsburg Landing. If Wallace continued in the same direction, he would have found himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the advancing Confederate troops.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1937, {{there was}} an effort to equip many tanks with a second machine gun <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the turret and an {{anti-aircraft}} machine gun on top of it, as well as the addition of two searchlights above the gun for night gunnery, a new VKU-3 command system, and a TPU-3 intercom. Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 gun telescopic sight. Ammunition stowage for the main gun was improved from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45mm model 1934 gun. Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped with radio set, had a PTK commander's panoramic sight.|$|E

50|$|Because {{termites}} {{are social}} insects, {{they share a}} lot of their tasks.

5|$|Kasuga and Nisshin {{participated in}} the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, but only played a minor role as they were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the Japanese battleline. During the battle, the ship's {{executive}} officer was Kantarō Suzuki, later Prime Minister of Japan. Kasuga was not significantly damaged, although she was hit three times with 11 crewmen wounded. Kasuga fired 33 ten-inch shells along with {{an unknown number of}} eight-inch shells during the battle. After the battle the sisters returned to Pigeon Bay where they engaged the Russian fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Kh. Fusail {{was about}} half {{way to the}} Jisr ed Damieh bridge, and after waiting for the {{dismounted}} sections of Meldrum's Force to arrive, the consolidated force advanced to attack Jisr ed Damieh. The 2nd Battalion, British West Indies Regiment remained to garrison Kh. Fusail, occupying a position at Talat Armah to protect Meldrum's right flank and rear, and if necessary to block the track from Mafid Jozele. Aerial reconnaissance flights during the evening of 21 September, confirmed that Shunet Nimrin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> Meldrum's Force was still strongly garrisoned, and that the roads and tracks running west from Amman were carrying normal traffic.|$|E

5|$|On {{the central}} front, the ROK III Corps defended the 38th {{parallel}} north of Gapyeong (Kapyong) and Chuncheon. Composed of the ROK 2nd, 5th, 7th and 8th Infantry Divisions, the ROK III Corps placed the ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the corps' left flank {{in the hills}} north of Gapyeong, while the ROK 5th Infantry Division defended the corps' center at Chuncheon. The winter conditions created great difficulties for the South Korean defenders, with the heavy snow hindering construction and icy roads limiting food and ammunition resupply. North Korean guerrillas were also active in the region, and caused serious disruption <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the ROK III Corps.|$|E
5|$|The 1,380-kW (1,850-hp) Shvetsov ASh-82 {{radial engine}} was {{proposed}} {{as a replacement}} to alleviate the shortage of engines and this modification went into production in late 1942. The exhaust arrangements of the ASh-82 were not compatible with the gun turrets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the engine nacelles and the guns were removed, reducing the aircraft's defensive capability. At the end of 1943, the nose turret was deleted {{in favor of a}} manually operated ShKAS machine gun in a more streamlined nose. This version of the aircraft proved to have much the same range as the diesel-engined versions, but reliability was greatly improved. Production of the Pe-8s totaled 93.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E

5|$|The L191 (also {{formerly}} {{called the}} SS191) is a tracer cartridge designed for easier bullet spotting in dim light. Combustible chemicals packed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the L191 projectile create a light trail visible up to 200m (219yd). The L191 has been manufactured {{with red and}} red-on-black tips. The performance and trajectory of the L191 {{is identical to the}} SS190. For this reason, it is also classified by the ATF as armor-piercing handgun ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.|$|E
5|$|The T48 {{originated}} from an Anglo-American requirement for a self-propelled 6-pounder anti-tank gun. The requirement {{was met by}} emplacing a 57mm gun M1 – the U.S. production version of the British Ordnance QF 6-pounder – <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> an M3 Half-track. The first production batch was ordered in April 1942. The Americans dropped their requirements because of the design of another tank destroyer, the M10. Afterwards, it was intended solely to be supplied overseas {{under the terms of}} the Lend-Lease Program; the T48 was never officially type-classified.|$|E
5|$|The XF6U {{was a small}} {{aircraft}} with tricycle {{landing gear}} and with straight wings and tail surfaces. The wings were short enough {{that they did not}} need to fold. In order to fit more aircraft into crowded hangars, the nose gear could be retracted and the aircraft's weight would rest on a small wheel attached by the ground crew. This raised the tail up so that it could overlap the nose of the aircraft behind it, allowing more aircraft to fit into available hangar space. The turbojet engine was mounted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the fuselage and was fed by ducts in each wing root.|$|E

The {{teenagers}} were children of sharecroppers and had been picking cotton all day. The market mostly served the local sharecropper population and was owned by a white couple, 24-year-old Roy Bryant and his 21-year-old wife Carolyn.

5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the 27th Brigade {{held their}} {{positions}} into the afternoon before the Australians were finally withdrawn to positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the brigade, {{with both sides}} having suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese then {{turned their attention to}} the Canadians on Hill 677, but during a fierce night battle they were unable to dislodge them. The fighting helped blunt the Chinese offensive and the actions of the Australians and Canadians at Kapyong were important in assisting to prevent a breakthrough on the United Nations Command central front, and ultimately the capture of Seoul. The two battalions bore the brunt of the assault and stopped an entire Chinese division during the hard fought defensive battle. The next day the Chinese withdrew back up the valley, in order to regroup. Today, the battle is {{regarded as one of the}} most famous actions fought by the Australian and Canadian armies in Korea.|$|E
