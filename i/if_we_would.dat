5|$|At Survivor Series, Kane {{tried to}} get Edge to bring Paul Bearer out to them but Edge brought out an empty wheelchair. Kane tried to {{interrogate}} Edge during their fight but in the end, Edge unknowingly double pinned his rival, keeping Kane as World Heavyweight Champion before wheeling Kane into a barricade. On November 26, Edge was offered {{a chance at a}} rematch with Kane for the title <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> let Bearer go free. But Edge did not keep his word. At the end of the night, Edge lured Kane outside and drove over a dummy of Paul Bearer before driving off with the real one again.|$|E

But they can afford no instruction to those who read them in their own ability; for, if they depend on their own interpretation, they are as a dead letter, in so much, that those who profess to consider them the proper rule of faith and practice, will kill one another for the Scriptures' sake.|$|E

How we had been made blind, deaf and dumb by this white race of people and how we must return to our people, our God and His religion of peace (Islam), {{the religion of the}} prophets. We must give up the slave names of our slave-masters and accept the name of Allah (God) or one of His divine attributes. He also taught us to give up all evil doings and practices and do righteousness or be destroyed {{from the face of the}} earth. He taught us that the slave-masters had taught us to eat the wrong food and that this wrong food is the cause of our sickness and short span of life. He {{declared that}} he would heal us and set us in heaven at once, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> submit to Him. Otherwise he would chastise us with a severe chastisement until we did submit. And that He was able to force the whole world into submission to his will. He said that he loved us (the so-called Negroes), his lost and found, so well that he would eat rattlesnakes to free us if necessary, for he has power over all things.|$|E

500|$|Wolfenstein: The New Order only {{features}} a single-player mode. The team felt that dividing focus and resources across both a single-player and an online multiplayer mode {{would be less}} efficient. When questioned {{about the lack of}} an online multiplayer mode, Öjerfors explained that the decision was simple. [...] "If we could take every bit of energy and sweat the studio has and pour all that into the single-player campaign, it gives us the resources to make something very, very cool, compared to <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> also have to divert some of our resources to making multiplayer." [...] Executive producer Jerk Gustafsson attributed the choice to the style of game the team is familiar with, stating that MachineGames is [...] "a single-player studio".|$|E
500|$|In October 2007, MTV {{reported}} that Hot Chip {{was planning to}} give [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] to Kylie Minogue. Other reports incorrectly suggested that Hot Chip had written Made in the Darks second single, [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] specifically for Minogue. Taylor explained {{that it was a}} misunderstanding; [...] "It started because someone asked me <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> ever write for Kylie. I said that we'd been asked to write for her but we'd never got round to it. And I said if we had to give her one of our songs, [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] would probably be the most suitable. From that, I got misquoted. We didn't write [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] for Kylie, didn't send it to her and she never heard it." ...|$|E
500|$|Citing Watchmen as {{the point}} where the comic book medium [...] "came of age", Iain Thomson wrote in his essay [...] "Deconstructing the Hero" [...] that the story {{accomplished}} this by [...] "developing its heroes precisely in order to deconstruct the very idea of the hero and so encouraging us to reflect upon its significance from the many different angles of the shards left lying on the ground". Thomson stated that the heroes in Watchmen almost all share a nihilistic outlook, and that Moore presents this outlook [...] "as the simple, unvarnished truth" [...] to [...] "deconstruct the would-be hero's ultimate motivation, namely, to provide a secular salvation and so attain a mortal immortality". He wrote that the story [...] "develops its heroes precisely in order to ask us <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not in fact be better off without heroes". Thomson added that the story's deconstruction of the hero concept [...] "suggests that perhaps the time for heroes has passed", which he feels distinguishes [...] "this postmodern work" [...] from the deconstructions of the hero in the existentialism movement. Richard Reynolds states that without any supervillains in the story, the superheroes of Watchmen are forced to confront [...] "more intangible social and moral concerns", adding that this removes the superhero concept from the normal narrative expectations of the genre. Reynolds concludes that the series' ironic self-awareness of the genre [...] "all mark out Watchmen either as the last key superhero text, or the first in a new maturity of the genre".|$|E

500|$|Insane Clown Posse {{sued the}} FBI, whose National Gang Intelligence Center listed Juggalos as [...] "a loosely {{organized}} hybrid gang" [...] in a 2011 report. The report states that Juggalos are [...] "recognized as a gang in only four states... {{law enforcement officials}} in at least 21 states have identified criminal Juggalo sub-sets". The report also noted that New Mexico was {{seeing a lot of}} Juggalo gang expansion due to their attraction to [...] "the tribal and cultural traditions of the Native Americans". The lawsuit asks for the documents that the FBI used to reach this conclusion; in August 2013, federal authorities had [...] "filed a motion to dismiss the case, saying they had already released several news media reports about Juggalos involved in criminal activity". The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan is working with ICP's lawyers in order [...] "to ensure the right of Juggalos everywhere to gather together and express their support of the I.C.P. without having to worry about being unfairly targeted and harassed by law enforcement". On January 8, 2014, Insane Clown Posse, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, filed suit again against the FBI. The suit aims to have Juggalos no longer considered to be a gang and to have any [...] "criminal intelligence information" [...] about Juggalos destroyed. ICP announced in the edition of December 21, 2012 of the Hatchet Herald that they will be releasing a sideshow EP to The Mighty Death Pop! in 2013. After no word was heard on the album, it was speculated that it had been scrapped. In mid 2013 it was announced that ICP would be releasing their first ever box set titled The First Six. After the release date came and passed, The First Six was not released. In a February 2014 interview with Faygoluvers, the question was asked <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> {{be able to get the}} box set. ICP thought it had already been released. Dog Beats (the first ever release on Psychopathic Records) was set to be the bonus album in the box set, ICP went back and decided to put House of Wax in the box set instead. The First Six was set to be released on October 28, 2014. After a minor setback, was ultimately released on November 25, 2014.|$|E

2500|$|From Dr. Clore's {{experimental}} vineyard, Sauer would {{plant the}} first commercial block of Cabernet franc in Washington State. In 1979, Red Willow began a working relationship with Columbia Winery and their Master of Wine winemaker David Lake. The English-born Lake {{had an interest in}} making Washington wine from European grapes and encouraged Red Willow to expand their plantings. According to Mike Sauer [...] "David was always very encouraging. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> grow it, he would make the wine from it." [...] In 1981, Columbia released the first vineyard designated wine to feature Red Willow on the wine label. From the 1983-1991, Red Willow and Columbia winery would pioneer the commercial planting and first varietal wines of many grape varieties including Malbec, Mourvedre, Nebbiolo, Sangiovese, Syrah, Tempranillo and Viognier.|$|E

He described his visit to Moscow as an [...] "expression of thankfulness that we in this country don't have to speak German, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have become submissive collaborators of Aryan origin", and that [...] "we don't have to say Heil Hitler, Heil Himmler, Heil Göring, and eventually Heil Heydrich, that would have been particularly interesting". Most other EU leaders declared that they would not attend the events due to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. U.S. ambassador Andrew H.
