40|$|Aerobic {{treatment}} {{is an alternative}} to the slower anaerobic treatment processes for concentrated industrial wastewater such as food processing wastewater. This paper reviews the performance of various aerobic treatment methods for the treatment of food processing wastewaters. It was noted that the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies and process capacities were affected by the variations in organic loading rates. The review shows that most suspended growth bioreactors are effective at low organic loading rates for treating food processing wastewaters. All biofilm reactors have a similar level of COD removal, but the highest COD removal efficiency at a high organic loading rate was observed in <b>flexible</b> <b>fibre</b> biofilm reactor (FFBR). Attached growth processes exhibited better performance for treating high strength food processing wastewater effectively, compared with conventional suspended methods. The high specific surface area and low sludge production of <b>flexible</b> <b>fibre</b> biofilm reactors are other advantages, compared with other attached growth biofilm systems. A <b>flexible</b> <b>fibre</b> biofilm reactor is a sound alternative from a process and economic perspective. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|E

A basic constitutive model for sand is adapted to this simple shear element; the fibres are added as a separate component able to withstand tension but without flexural stiffness.

Biomaterial dynamics in a moving drum has also been described in a number of publications (silk, wool and leather), but very rarely using computer modelling and simulation. Discrete element method (DEM) is a proven technique to accurately describe the motion of bodies in a constrained space. Other authors have described the motion of fabric in the drum using three basic models: rotating circular bundle, rigid fibre, and completely <b>flexible</b> <b>fibre.</b> The study reported in this paper considers the rotating circular bundle and the completely <b>flexible</b> <b>fibre</b> model on sensitive biomaterials. The inclusion of shear and tensile modulus through Hertz-Mindlin contact models (with bonding), helps to describe the dynamics of biomaterials, and the variation of the processing parameters gives researchers insight into the forces that can be exerted on sensitive materials before rupture. The research examines the variation of rotation speed, load-volume, density and the inclusion of water into the horizontal drum and their influence on the coefficients of friction and restitution. The research then goes on to analyse the influence the changes have on the angle of repose (of materials slipping off lifters) and the resulting changes in velocity when these process parameters are varied. It is concluded that both the rotating circular bundle and completely <b>flexible</b> <b>fibre</b> model can be used in proprietary DEM software and allow the researcher to alter processing parameters to prevent damage to sensitive materials...|$|E

A <b>flexible</b> <b>fibre</b> biofim reactor (FFBR) has been developed for efficient and cost effective treatment of food processing wastewater. In the process, simple <b>flexible</b> <b>fibre</b> packing with a very high specific surface area is used as support for microorganisms. The COD removal efficiencies for a range of OLRs have been studied. The FFBR can support an increasingly high OLR, but with a corresponding decrease in the COD removal efficiency. Therefore, a two-stage FFBR was developed to increase the treatment efficiency for systems with high OLRs. Experimental results indicated that a high overall COD removal efficiency could be achieved. At an influent COD of about 2700 mg/L and an OLR of 7. 7 kgCOD/m 3 d, COD removal efficiencies of 76 % and 82 % were achieved in the first and the second stage of the reactor, respectively.

40|$|Biological {{treatment}} methods are usually effective and {{commonly used in}} the treatment of organic wastewater. However, {{there are a number of}} problems for conventional biological {{treatment methods}} in treating wastewater from industries such as food processing. For example, microorganisms in the aeration tank in an activated sludge process cannot survive a continuous series of shock loads and the process could become operationally unstable. The associated problem of sludge bulking often occurs when the organic loading to the treatment process is high. In this paper, a new <b>flexible</b> <b>fibre</b> biofilm reactor was developed for the treatment of wastewater from fruit and vegetable processing plants. Experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance of the treatment process. Acclimatisation characteristics of the treatment process were also evaluated. The removal efficiencies for COD and BOD 5 for different influent organic strengths were evaluated. Results indicated that over 90 % COD removal and 95 % BOD 5 removal could be achieved. The performance parameters were also compared with a conventional activated sludge process under similar conditions, operated in parallel. It was found that the biofilm reactor exhibited a number of advantages over the conventional reactor. These include (a) high organic loading rate, (b) long sludge retention times and low sludge discharge rate in the settling tank (about 10 %), (c) elimination of the sludge recycle stream, and (d) no sludge bulking problem at high organic loading rates.

This posed some modelling challenges in terms of stability which were overcome by imposing limits on the particle angular velocity. The results show very good agreement with experimental data in the literature and more detailed in-house experiments for packing volume fraction. Model results on particle orientation are also shown.

The growth and formation of macrofibers were studied with time-lapse microscopy methods. The basic growth mode consisted of fiber elongation, folding, and the helical wrapping together of the folded portion into a tight helical fiber. This sequence was reiterated {{at both ends of}} the structure, resulting in terminal loops. Macrofiber growth was accompanied by the helical turning of the structure along its long axis. Right-handed structures turned clockwise and left-handed ones turned counterclockwise when viewed along the length of a fiber looking toward a loop end. Helical turning forced the individual cellular filaments into a close-packing arrangement during growth. Tension was evident within the structures and they writhed as they elongated. Tension was relieved by folding, which occurred when writhing became so violent that the structure touched itself, forming a loop. When the multistranded structure produced by repeated folding cycles became too rigid for additional folding, the morphogenesis of a ball-like structure began. The dynamics of helical macrofiber formation was interpreted in terms of stress-strain deformations. In view of the similarities between macrofiber structures and those found in multifilament yarns and cables, the physics of helical macrofiber structure and also growth may be suitable for analysis developed in these fields concerning the mechanics of flexible fiber assemblies (C.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of the ciliary bundles of hair {{cells in the}} turtle cochlea was examined by deflecting them with flexible glass fibres of known compliance during simultaneous intracellular recording of the cell's membrane potential. Bundle motion was monitored through the attached fibre partially occluding a light beam incident on a photodiode array. The change in photocurrent {{was assumed to be}} proportional to bundle displacement. For deflexions of 1 - 100 nm towards the kinocilium, the stiffness of the ciliary bundles was estimated as about 6 X 10 (- 4) N/m, with the fibre attached {{to the top of the}} bundle. When the fibre was placed at different positions up the bundle, the stiffness decreased approximately as the inverse square of the distance from the ciliary base. This suggests that the bundles rotate about an axis close to the apical pole of the cell and have a rotational stiffness of about 2 X 10 (- 14) N. m/rad. Step displacements of the fixed end of the <b>flexible</b> <b>fibre</b> caused the hair cell's membrane potential to execute damped oscillations; the frequency of the oscillations in different cells ranged from 20 to 320 Hz. Displacements towards the kinocilium always produced membrane depolarization. The amplitude of the initial oscillation increased with displacements up to 100 nm and then saturated. For small displacements of a few nanometres, the hair cell's mechanoelectrical sensitivity was estimated as about 0. 2 mV/nm. Force steps delivered by the <b>flexible</b> <b>fibre</b> caused the bundle position to undergo damped oscillations in synchrony with the receptor potential. The mechanical oscillations could be abolished with large depolarizing currents that attenuated the receptor potential. When placed against a bundle, a fibre's spontaneous motion increased and became quasi-sinusoidal with an amplitude several times that expected from the compliance of the system. It is suggested that the hair bundle drives the fibre. We conclude that turtle cochlear hair cells contain an active force generating mechanism...|$|E

The formula shows a sulphur excess which may correspond to S-S bonding (persulphide). The new sulphosalt is a late phase in the crystallization sequence, and was formed after orpiment, contemporaneously with quartz II, at a temperature between 157 and 193 degrees C. The name honours Dr Farahnaz Daliran (University of Karlsruhe, Germany) in recognition of her outstanding contributions to research on ore deposits, especially Au, Zn and Fe, in Iran...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{reinforcement}} with discrete <b>flexible</b> <b>fibres</b> {{has always}} been an issue for further research. In Geotechnical engineering field, the research on sandy soil has considerably been more than the clayey one. The main reason for this lack can be expressed as the complexity of clayey material due to their cohesion and interaction between clay and reinforcement. The present research aims to show possibility of discrete fibre usage in clay. For this purpose, selection of material has been conducted with special care to make the project outcome applicable to industry projects. The fibre which was used for this research prepared by BASF Company in Western Australia and currently is used in fibre reinforced concrete for infrastructure projects. Kaolin has been used as soil part and provided by Prestige Company. Experimental approach was applied to investigate the effect of different parameters on composite soil strength. These tests cover the variety range of soil mechanics tests from compaction tests to triaxial compression tests. The results from all the tests were presented in the thesis. A theoretical model was also developed for clayey material {{for the first time with}} the use of modified cam clay model to predict the behaviour of samples precisely. This model is based on the rule of mixture and considers the effect of soil and fibre separately. The model was validated with the results from CD triaxial test...|$|R
