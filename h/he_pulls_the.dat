5|$|The game {{begins as}} three {{boys from the}} small Potos village disobey their Elder's {{instructions}} and trespass into a local waterfall, where a treasure {{is said to be}} kept. One of the boys stumbles and falls into the lake, where he finds a rusty sword embedded in a stone. Guided by a disembodied voice, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> sword free, inadvertently unleashing monsters in the surrounding countryside of the village. The villagers interpret the sword's removal as a bad omen and banish the boy from Potos forever. A traveling knight named Jema recognizes the blade as the legendary Mana Sword and encourages the hero to re-energize it by visiting the eight Mana Temples.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Ritter soon {{discover}} that their prime suspect, Alfred Fellig, {{who has worked}} as a police photographer since 1964, has not aged at all in any of his official photos on his renewal applications. Elsewhere in the city, Fellig watches a criminal kill a youth for his sneakers. When he approaches to take photos of the dying young man, the murderer returns and repeatedly stabs Fellig, but <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> knife out of his back and walks away. Scully and Ritter learn of the crime and of the fact that Fellig's prints are on the knife. Ritter demands to know how Fellig always seems to be around when people die, but Scully realizes that the man is in pain and asks whether he was wounded in the attack which Fellig says he merely observed. When she sees the wounds on his back she sends him to the hospital, much to Ritter's chagrin. Ritter reminds Scully that they are trying to charge Fellig with murder, not let him go.|$|E
5|$|When Lincoln {{finds that}} the camera has not {{detected}} any motion, the group sets out into the forest once more. Wendy is dragged away by the shark and killed. The shark attacks Cameron, and Chapman shoots {{him in the head}} to end his pain. Hoffman and Mike soon join up with Chapman and Lincoln. Hoffman plans to start a large fire to attract the shark, as he surmises that the heat will confuse it, but it kills him before he can drop a lighter. Mike pulls out a hand grenade but the shark bites off his legs, and Chapman and Lincoln make the decision to run away. The shark reappears and attempts to kill Mike, but <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> grenade's pin, causing them both to explode. After reporting the incident to the police station, Chapman and Lincoln see multiple shark fins in the snow and escape. Later, a woman named Daphne approaches Ethan's grave to lay a wreath, and a shark fin approaches her as she walks out of the graveyard.|$|E
60|$|Nathan did so. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> handles apart, {{and held}} them open.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Roy {{reined in}} so sharply that <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> bay up short.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> cord. The {{carriage}} {{rolled to}} a standstill; a footman appeared at the door.|$|R
25|$|In 1898, Empress Sissi {{was assassinated}} {{at the age}} of 60 by an Italian anarchist, Luigi Lucheni, in Geneva, Switzerland. After her death, the palace was sold to the German Kaiser Wilhelm II. In contrast, at the great {{staircase}} in the main hall is a giant painting of the triumphant Achilles full of pride. Dressed in full royal military regalia and erect on his racing chariot, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> lifeless body of Hector of Troy in front of the stunned crowd watching helplessly from inside the walls of the Trojan citadel.|$|E
25|$|That night Sir Thomas drowns in his bath as Blackwood watches, and {{the next}} night Lord Coward calls {{a meeting of the}} Order. He nominates Blackwood to take command in place of Sir Thomas and Blackwood reveals himself to the group. Standish {{attempts}} to shoot Blackwood but is set on fire when <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> trigger of his gun, and runs out a window to his death. Lord Coward issues an arrest warrant for Holmes, causing him to go into hiding. Holmes studies the rituals of the Order and recognizes their symbols in Blackwood's murders that were staged at specific locations; from this he deduces the targets of the final murder are the members of Parliament. With the aid of Lestrade, Holmes fakes arrest and is taken to see Coward, where he uses evidence on Coward's clothes to deduce Blackwood has conducted a ceremony in the sewers beneath the Palace of Westminster.|$|E
500|$|Taylor cabled Washington to say [...] "I {{can well}} {{visualize}} [...] necessity {{at some time}} of using full U.S. leverage ... to induce our Vietnamese friends to get Khánh out of [...] position of commander-in-chief (from which <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> strings) and to install their very best governmental line-up." [...] He also told his State Department superiors that Khánh was very likely aware of his machinations, but {{that he did not}} care about this. At the same time, there was also the question of finding another military-appointed prime minister to replace Hương. Taylor wanted Nguyen Luu Vien, Huong's deputy, to take over, and advised South Vietnamese officers who were on good terms with him to try to engineer this, but they were not able to get enough support. Eventually, Phan Huy Quát was appointed prime minister on February 14. Quát was a moderate Buddhist not associated with the political demonstrators, and seen as a compromise candidate who would be acceptable across the religious spectrum, albeit grudgingly. He was also regarded as being favorable to Khánh, who would not be around {{for more than a few}} more days to support, control or pressure him in any case. All the while, intelligence reports of Khánh's attempted dealings with the communists increased.|$|E
60|$|The doctor's son now understood, {{and raising}} his shotgun {{with one arm}} <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger.|$|R
60|$|But Snap had {{somewhat}} {{recovered from}} his astonishment, and raising his shotgun quickly, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger.|$|R
60|$|D'Arnot sighted {{along the}} blue barrel {{at the crack}} of <b>the</b> door--and then <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger.|$|R
6000|$|... “He doesn’t {{know how}} to. Every time <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> lever marked ‘release’ he only {{releases}} hot steam. There {{are two kinds}} of steam in the bath, ‘bearable’ and ‘scarcely bearable’; he has released them both. By this time I’m probably a widow.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{only one}} way," [...] said Dave, {{significantly}} tapping the black handle of his Colt. [...] "Holderness thinks <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> wool over our eyes by talking {{of the cattle}} company that employs him. He's the company himself, and he's hand and glove with Dene." ...|$|E
6000|$|CRICHTON (she {{clings to}} him, but {{though it is}} his death {{sentence}} he loosens her hold). Bill Crichton has got to play the game. (<b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> levers. Soon through the window one of the beacons is seen flaring red. There is a long pause. Shouting is heard. ERNEST {{is the first to}} arrive.) ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had ordered}} the coachman {{to drive to the}} House of Commons. Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> check-string.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yah!" [...] said <b>the</b> mayor, and <b>pulled</b> {{as hard as}} he dared: but <b>the</b> more <b>he</b> <b>pulled,</b> <b>the</b> {{more the}} lobster pinched, till he was forced to be quiet.|$|R
60|$|They were half-way {{along it}} when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> horse up, {{and once more}} looked down on Winston.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Macumazahn, I do not think, I am sure. He is the {{greatest}} of all wizards, as he was when my father held on to his mother's apron. <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> strings and the Great-ones of the country dance. If he wishes war, there will be war. If he wishes peace, there will be peace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (<b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> {{curtains}} apart, {{and there}} comes a sudden indrawing of breath from all, for no garden is there now. In its place is an endless wood of great trees; the nearest of them has {{come close to the}} window. It is a sombre wood, with splashes of moonshine and of blackness standing very still in it.) ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{interesting}} but unnoticed {{thing about}} these minor characters {{is that they}} all have their life-size prototypes in the novels of Dickens. Thackeray's characters, as he explains in his preface, are [...] "mere puppets," [...] who must move when <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> strings. Dickens {{does not have to}} explain that his characters are men and women who do very much as they please. That is, perhaps, the chief difference between the two novelists.|$|E
60|$|And quite {{suddenly}} <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> {{door open}} to disclose Giuliana standing there, erect but in a listening attitude.|$|R
60|$|Roger had {{the shotgun}} ready, and without {{taking time to}} bring the weapon to his shoulder, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger.|$|R
25|$|At first I {{had very}} little idea how the story would go. But then {{suddenly}} Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> whole story together, and soon <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> six other Narnian stories in after him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Chapter 16. Christ {{miraculously}} widens or contracts gates, [...] milk-pails, sieves or boxes, {{not properly}} made by Joseph, he not [...] being skillful at his carpenter's trade. The King of Jerusalem [...] gives Joseph {{an order for}} a throne. Joseph works on it for two [...] years and makes it two spans too short. The King being angry with [...] him, Jesus comforts him--commands him to pull {{one side of the}} [...] throne while <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> other, and brings it to its proper [...] dimensions.|$|E
6000|$|... “There’s them living who {{say that}} Nathaniel Bumppo's right to shoot on these hills is of older date than Marmaduke Temple’s right to forbid him,” he said. “But if there’s a law about it at all, though who {{ever heard of a}} law that a man shouldn’t kill deer where he pleased!—but if there is a law at all, it should be to keep people from the use of smooth-bores. A body never knows where his lead will fly, when <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> trigger of one of them {{uncertain}} firearms.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's very possible," [...] Ida {{agreed with}} a hint of dryness. [...] "I want you to show him what it means; make him feel the sense of power over material. Jake's rather boyish, and a boy loves to fire a gun because {{something}} startling happens in obedience to his will when <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> trigger. Isn't it much the same when one gives the orders that shatter massive rocks and move ponderous stones? However, that's not all. I want you to keep him at the dam and prevent his making undesirable friends." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> flour bag wider {{open and}} {{presently}} produced a big paper package {{which seemed to}} have lost its shape.|$|R
60|$|He ran to {{a supply}} {{cupboard}} {{and turned the}} handle. The door opened and <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> suits out onto the floor.|$|R
60|$|He {{heaved a}} sigh at her, and then, {{reaching}} out his hand, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> woollen bell-rope {{up and down}} several times.|$|R
60|$|REVOLUTION, n. In politics, {{an abrupt}} {{change in the}} form of misgovernment. Specifically, in American history, the {{substitution}} of the rule of an Administration for that of a Ministry, whereby the welfare and happiness of the people were advanced a full half-inch. Revolutions are usually accompanied by a considerable effusion of blood, but are accounted worth it--this appraisement being made by beneficiaries whose blood had not the mischance to be shed. The French revolution is of incalculable value to the Socialist of to-day; when <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> string actuating its bones its gestures are inexpressibly terrifying to gory tyrants suspected of fomenting law and order.|$|E
60|$|The unfortunate Mr Venus {{gives him}} a shake of the hand {{with a shake of}} his own head, and {{drooping}} down in his chair, proceeds to pour himself out more tea. Mr Wegg, looking back over his shoulder as <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> door open by the strap, notices that the movement so shakes the crazy shop, and so shakes a momentary flare out of the candle, as that the babies--Hindoo, African, and British--the 'human warious', the French gentleman, the green glass-eyed cats, the dogs, the ducks, {{and all the rest of}} the collection, show for an instant as if paralytically animated; while even poor little Cock Robin at Mr Venus's elbow turns over on his innocent side. Next moment, Mr Wegg is stumping under the gaslights and through the mud.|$|E
60|$|My landlord, an officious though well-meaning fellow, {{had sent}} {{away for the}} {{neighbouring}} clergyman; and when my gentleman began to speak of it to him, and talk of sending for him, 'Sir,' says he to him, 'my friend is in the house'; so without any more words he brought them together. When {{he came to the}} minister, he asked him if he would venture to marry a couple of strangers that were both willing. The parson said that Mr. ---- had said something to him of it; that he hoped it was no clandestine business; that he seemed to be a grave gentleman, and he supposed madam was not a girl, so that the consent of friends should be wanted. 'To put you out of doubt of that,' says my gentleman, 'read this paper'; and out <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>the</b> license. 'I am satisfied,' says the minister; 'where is the lady?' 'You shall see her presently,' says my gentleman.|$|E
60|$|Their way led {{past the}} theatre. He {{glanced at his}} watch--the last act was still in full swing. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> check cord.|$|R
5000|$|Hollywood killed Nicholas Markowitz [...] "like <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger himself," [...] Lynn said. [...] "The {{evidence}} will show Mr. Hollywood is a ruthless coward." ...|$|R
