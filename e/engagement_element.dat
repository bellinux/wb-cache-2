40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Teaching and Learning, Washington State UniversityThis {{dissertation}} {{includes two}} studies {{to explore the}} application of task engagement principles in foreign language instructional design and practice. The first study explores how task engagement principles can be integrated into online foreign language instructional design. It employs a design-based research (DBR) approach to combining research and design {{in the development of}} Chinese as a foreign language (CFL) online learning tasks for American teacher education students. With the intent of solving practical problems in a real teaching context, five designers worked as a design team in this study to refine an online learning module. Through the design process, the team explored how task engagement principles could be integrated into an online learning module and how collaboration and interaction among researchers and designers could support the implementation of the design. Finally, five engagement principles were identified as essential elements in designing engaging tasks and an onsite learning segment was suggested by students to offer more opportunities for instant feedback and practice. The second study is designed as a follow-up study to examine whether the refined Chinese learning module is effective in engaging students in practice. This study employs the five engagement principles identified by the first study as the theoretical framework to explore whether and why students perceive engagement in a flipped CFL learning environment in which they learned language content online and practiced onsite. In this flipped learning environment, the online learning segment consisted of the refined learning tasks reported in the first study, and the onsite segment was created according to students' suggestions and feedback. Participants were 50 American undergraduate pre-service teachers who were enrolled in a flipped Chinese for Teachers module in Fall 2013. Surveys, follow-up interviews, focus groups and student documents explored how students perceive their engagement in the Chinese learning tasks and the reasons for their perceptions. Participants' perceptions of five engagement principles are presented and the reasons for their perceptions are discussed under each <b>engagement</b> <b>element.</b> Finally, implications are generated for future instructional design and practice.

40|$|In {{the arena}} of {{planning}} in Hong Kong, the doctrine of community planning is still an abstract idea {{and has not been}} formally adopted by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. Be that as it may, the word “community planning” or “community participation” was always mentioned in strategic dimensions of planning in Hong Kong in recent years. On the other hand, the discussion among community planning around the global asked for a higher and higher participation level in community planning process, shifting from participation to empowerment. Thus, this dissertation attempts to fill this research gap, analyzing the degree of empowerment under the planning frameworks and institutions in Hong Kong and how effective is community planning to empower citizens in Hong Kong. The community <b>engagement</b> <b>elements</b> within the planning related institutional frameworks in Hong Kong were reviewed and analyzed, in order to figure out the extent of empowerment of the community <b>engagement</b> <b>elements</b> in these frame works. On the other hand, a local planning concern group, which adopts community planning based approach, was used as a contextual study of analyzing the effectiveness of community planning based practices to empower citizens in Hong Kong. It was found that the extent of empowerment of the community <b>engagement</b> <b>elements</b> in planning frameworks of Hong Kong is limited, and community planning based practices is effective in empowering citizens. Thus, if planning in Hong Kong is to empower, but not disempower citizens, community planning approaches should be adopted. A series of empowering community planning process was recommended in this final part of this study. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignMasterMaster of Science in Urban Plannin...|$|R

40|$|The {{communities}} located {{adjacent to}} {{and around the}} Airport City are composed of diverse interests and cultures that often {{have little to do}} with the airport and its global service functions. Yet, as most airport managers know, these communities can have a significant impact on airport operations and land use. Community engagement is an essential element to airport planning and management that is often underplayed and given only a token effort. In order for Airport Cities to realize their full potential in global and national markets as well as assume an appropriate level of corporate responsibility there needs to be a strong and enduring connections to local and regional communities. Through a series of nationally held workshops throughout Australia and internationally, we have reviewed the complex relationship between airports and their surrounding communities. We argue the following <b>engagement</b> <b>elements</b> improve both communication and relationships with local communities and must be actively nurtured, developed and pursued by airport managers: connectivity, collaboration and citizenry. ...|$|R

40|$|Internationally, {{assessment}} is acknowledged {{as a critical}} aspect of pedagogical practice and accountability systems, and as having a fundamental bearing upon what knowledge and ways of articulating knowledge come to be valued in schools. Teachers' assessment literacy is arguably fundamental {{to their ability to}} successfully engage with multiple expectations of assessment and to facilitate assessment as a process that continually supports learning. Informed by Hay and Penney's ((2013) Assessment in Physical Education: A Sociocultural Perspective. London: Routledge) assessment literacy framework, a qualitative case study investigation was undertaken with 18 primary physical education teachers in a regional area in Australia to gain insight into their assessment practices. The study utilised informal interviews, survey and document analysis. Primary physical education teachers were shown to be engaging with the comprehension, application, interpretation and critical <b>engagement</b> <b>elements</b> of the assessment literacy framework, albeit with limitations. Assessment practices appear to be embedded in teaching practices but were, in the main, superficial.

40|$|Human Rights {{organizations}} {{have a history}} in fighting against violations and issues that are affecting the individuals, groups and nations worldwide, however, constant challenges faced by such organizations proved to delay effective advancement in access to human rights. The research aims at tackling the challenges {{from the standpoint of}} a necessary change in the organizational perception of campaigning systems to improve performance and achieve significant outcomes. The research proposes the inclusion of new technological trends of engagement that proved effective and resourceful in other sectors. The motivations underlying the behavior of human beings are influenced by the tendency to satisfy psychological needs, such as self-achievement, meaning, recognition, status and altruism. The research will discuss the psychological motivations behind people’s engagement in online activities and extend them to explain why gamification and crowdsourcing harnessed success and why such methods would be significant adaptations for campaigning in human rights. Case study methodology was adopted for this research to examine campaigns of human rights organizations that used gamification and crowdsourcing techniques, where data pertaining to the cases have been collected from the concerned websites and other reliable social media and networking online resources. The findings revealed a positive impact from applying gamification and crowdsourcing in the two selected cases, translated in the raised funds, awareness levels, contribution, participation and interaction. The outcome of this research will help identify what the expectations of people are when they logon into their social profiles and will consequently; assist human rights organizations in selecting the components of their campaigns and various <b>engagement</b> <b>elements</b> according to the interests of the targeted users of social platforms...|$|R
