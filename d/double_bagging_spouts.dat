40|$|The ammonia loss through Nalophan bags {{has been}} studied. The losses {{observed}} for storage conditions and times as {{allowed by the}} reference standard for dynamic olfactometry (EN 13725 : 2003) indicate that odour concentration values due {{to the presence of}} small molecules may be significantly underestimated if samples are not analysed immediately after sampling. A diffusion model was used in order to study diffusion through the bag. The study discusses the effect of concentration gradient (ΔC) across the polymeric membrane of the analyte. The ΔC was controlled by using a setup bag called “double bags. ” Experimental data show a reduction of ammonia percentage losses due to the effect of the external multibarrier. The expedient of the <b>double</b> <b>bag</b> loaded with the same gas mixture allows a reduced diffusion of ammonia into the inner bag. Comparing the inner bag losses with those of the single bag stored in the same conditions (T, P, u) and with equal geometrical characteristics (S/V, z), it was observed that the inner <b>bag</b> of the <b>double</b> <b>bag</b> displays a 16 % loss while the single bag displays a 37 % loss.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of the addition of calcium to bicarbonate solutions for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). We tested single bag (bicarbonate and calcium mixed 24 It before testing) and <b>double</b> <b>bag</b> solutions (mixed immediately before) with and without the addition of 4 mEq/L of acetate. Prescribed calcium varied from 0 to 5 mEq/L. All test solutions containing calcium showed crystallization at light microscopy. the <b>double</b> <b>bag</b> solutions decreased but did not prevent crystallization. the addition of acetate did not interfere with crystallization. Crystallization. as measured by the weight of the crystals after filtration of the solutions, showed a significant positive correlation with the calcium deficit (prescribed minus measured) and with partial pressure of carbon dioxide. the measured level of calcium was lower than expected and correlated with crystallization. Our results suggest that the use of bicarbonate solutions containing calcium as replacement fluids for CRRT is a potentially unsafe procedure.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that the mixture of bicarbonate and calcium in the solutions used for continuous renal replacement therapy led to crystalization and significant changes in calcium concentration and pH. {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the impact of bicarbonate/calcium and lactate/calcium solutions for Continuous Renal Replacement Therapies (CRRT) on the viability and function of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN). We tested four customized bicarbonate buffered solutions: single bag (bicarbonate and calcium mixed 24 h before testing), <b>double</b> <b>bag</b> (mixed immediately before testing), filtered single <b>bag</b> and <b>double</b> <b>bag</b> solutions, and a commercial lactate buffered solution. Blood from 6 volunteers was incubated with the solutions for 30 min followed by PMN isolation. After overnight incubation, viability, phagocytosis, and peroxide production by PMN were determined by flow cytometry. There was no difference between the test solutions with respect to PMN viability and function. Therefore, the presence of microcrystals and the consequent changes in electrolyte concentrations do not seem to impair PMN function.

50|$|Many users report {{degradation}} of alpha-GPC when stored openly or {{for long periods}} of time. Alpha-GPC is hygroscopic and will pull moisture in from the surrounding air. This will cause the powder to turn into {{what appears to be a}} gel. Alpha-GPC with >99% purity will undergo this process at a visible rate (seconds to minutes) and thus requires minimized exposure to the air. This hygroscopic quality can cause gel capsules not fully packed with alpha-GPC to dissolve. Proper storage methods need to be used with alpha-GPC and include removing all air from the container, <b>double</b> <b>bagging</b> with plastic bags rated for chemicals (less likely to leak air), and storing bulk/excess inside the freezer. Vacuum sealed bags are highly recommended. For people accessing alpha-GPC daily it is advisable to separate a month's supply from excess and storing the excess as best as possible. Vacuum sealing a large supply into many 1 month dividends is a method positively reported by many users. It is important to note that hygroscopy is not degradation and leaves the substance still usable, however, the ability to accurately weigh a dose is no longer possible as the substance being weighed will be a mixture of powder and water. Liquefied or gelled alpha-GPC may also be indicative of poor storage and thus have an increased likelihood of actual degradation.|$|R
