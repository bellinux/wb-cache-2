2500|$|Also, the [...] "kuge" [...] that Iwate served {{was a word}} used {{starting}} {{from the age of}} buke, but the Jinki era when the Heian capital <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> been built, so there's also the contradiction that in the era in which Iwate served the aristocratic family, her place of service, Kyō no Miyako, did not even exist. Also, the name [...] "Iwate" [...] was a made-up name from a play titled Iwate, so there is no way a person named that could have really existed. For these reasons, this legend concerning the onibaba's origins is seen as a tale that was made up afterwards as a means to try to fill in the gaps.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, the Skeptical Inquirer {{published}} a detailed three-year study by Ryan Shaffer and Agatha Jadwiszczok that examined Browne's predictions about missing persons and murder cases.

In the rest, where the final outcome was unknown, her predictions could not be substantiated. The study concluded that the media outlets that repeatedly promoted Browne's work had no visible concern about whether she was untrustworthy or harmed people. Among the predictions examined in the study were the following: ...|$|E

[...] Even in recent years, {{as when the}} father of Crazy Horse went to examine his son’s tomb, the custom of Indians in old times, he sound the skeleton had petrified.

[...] Past He Dog’s Village; past one-room log cabins with broken and rusted farm implements strewn about, mostly with a tepee on the outside, ground uncultivated and dead; nothing green. [...] Past a little church once painted white, cross on a low steeple, and set {{in a field of}} little white crosses, reminder of sad ending of babies and youth unable to survive in the environment denominated “reservation” by a “charitable” government. [...] Even jack rabbits and birds were absent in this long desolation. [...] But it was good enough for Indians by the white man’s laws. [...] Miles and miles, and finally a little creek bed was crossed to a service pump, and tiny store, it was Brennan, P.O., and just at the rear was the little monument {{at the head of the}} trench where the soldiers who murdered them, buried the frozen bodies of men, women and children to the number of two hundred and ninety, shot down with machine guns to let lie for two days in sub-zero storms (90 men 200 women and children). In one pile of bodies were two mothers whose babes were clasped close to the breast and within their heavy blanket shawls.
