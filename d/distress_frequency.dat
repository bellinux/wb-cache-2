According to the U.S. Navy investigation Vincennes at that time had no equipment suitable for monitoring civil aviation frequencies, other than the International Air <b>Distress</b> <b>frequency.</b> Subsequently U.S. Navy warships in the area were equipped with dialable VHF radios, and access to flight plan information was sought, to better track commercial airliners.|$|E

Cooper then contacted the upbound saltwater vessel Nanfri and was told that she could not pick up Fitzgerald on her radar. Despite repeated attempts to raise the USCG, Cooper was not successful until 7:54p.m. when the officer on duty asked him to keep watch for a [...] boat lost in the area. At about 8:25p.m., Cooper again called the USCG to express his concern about Fitzgerald and at 9:03p.m. reported her missing.

50|$|There was {{worldwide}} {{shock at}} the huge loss {{of life and the}} procedural errors that had led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety. One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today. Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications—which could have saved many more passengers.Primary to these improved regulations were the installation of radio equipment on ALL ships, fixed <b>Distress</b> <b>frequencies</b> and 24-hour watch on those frequencies.|$|R
