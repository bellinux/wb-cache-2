5|$|William Legrand has {{relocated}} <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> to Sullivan's Island in South Carolina {{after losing}} his family fortune, and has brought his African-American servant Jupiter with him. The story's narrator, {{a friend of}} Legrand, visits him one evening to see an unusual scarab-like bug he has found. The bug's weight and lustrous appearance convince Jupiter that it is made of pure gold. Legrand has lent it to an officer stationed at a nearby fort, but he draws a sketch of it for the narrator, with markings on the carapace that resemble a skull. As they discuss the bug, Legrand becomes particularly focused on the sketch and carefully locks it in his desk for safekeeping. Confused, the narrator takes his leave for the night.|$|E
