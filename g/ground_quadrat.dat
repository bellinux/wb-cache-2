40|$|The loss of {{unimproved}} grassland {{has led to}} species {{decline in}} a wide range of taxonomic groups. Agricultural intensification has resulted in fragmented patches of remnant grassland habitat both across Europe and internationally. The monitoring of remnant patches of this habitat is critically important, however, traditional surveying of large, remote landscapes is a notoriously costly and difficult task. The emergence of small-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) equipped with low-cost multi-spectral cameras offer an alternative to traditional grassland survey methods, and have the potential to progress and innovate the monitoring and future conservation of this habitat globally. The aim of this article is to investigate the potential of sUAS for rapid detection of threatened unimproved grassland and to test the use of an Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI). A sUAS aerial survey is undertaken at a site nationally recognised as an important location for fragmented unimproved mesotrophic grassland, within the south east of England, UK. A multispectral camera is used to capture imagery in the visible and near-infrared spectrums, and the ENDVI calculated and its discrimination performance compared to a range of more traditional vegetation indices. In order to validate the results of analysis, <b>ground</b> <b>quadrat</b> surveys were carried out to determine the grassland communities present. Quadrat surveys identified three community types within the site; unimproved grassland, improved grassland and rush pasture. All six vegetation indices tested were able to distinguish between the broad habitat types of grassland and rush pasture; whilst only three could differentiate vegetation at a community level. The Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI) was the most effective index when differentiating grasslands at the community level. The mechanisms behind the improved performance of the ENDVI are discussed and recommendations are made for areas of future research and study...|$|E
40|$|The last {{surviving}} Mauritian {{fruit bat}} species, Pteropus niger, although endangered, provides essential seed dispersal and pollination {{services for the}} threatened native flora. However, their foraging habitats in native forest remnants are dominated by alien invasive plants and are inhabited by invasive alien animals like long-tailed macaques. Competition for food resources and a decrease of native fruiting trees appear to force fruit bats to top up their diet with cultivated fruits. Consequently, a rapidly escalating conflict with local farmers resulted in a mass cull initiated by the Mauritian government that decimated around 50 % of the fruit bat population. Here, I investigate the impact of invasive alien plant control on the foraging habitat quality of fruit bats, by quantifying fruit production and fruit bat foraging intensity in weeded and non-weeded forest areas using <b>ground</b> <b>quadrats.</b> Moreover, I examine how native tree traits and fruit characteristics affect tree and fruit selection of flying foxes and long-tailed macaques. Weeding significantly increased both native fruit production and fruit bat foraging intensity. Fruit bats preferred to forage in weeded areas on tall trees with a large crown. In addition, fruit bats preferred large and ripe fruits, while long-tailed macaques more often used small unripe fruits. Peak of native fruit use by macaques coincided with lower use by fruit bats, suggesting resource competition. The results suggest that weeded forests provide a better foraging habitat for P. niger than non-weeded areas, and {{emphasize the importance of}} weeding for the recovery of native plant communities and their associated biodiversity. I conclude that weeding and controlling of the introduced long-tailed macaque population may be solutions to mitigate the current human-wildlife conflict. In the long term, failure to improve native foraging habitats of fruit bats is likely to increase their extinction risk on Mauritius...|$|R
40|$|A two-hectare plot of a {{deciduous}} dipterocarp-oak {{forest of}} Doi Suthep-Pui National park of northern Thailand protected against fire for 28 years was {{compared with a}} similar, but frequently burnt forest nearby with respect to changes in plant diversity. The objective of was {{to find out the}} effects of forest fire protection on plant diversity. To survey the tree communities, six meter wide transects with a total length of 650 m in each site were laid out across the slope of the mountain following a bearing of 60. To survey the <b>ground</b> flora, <b>quadrats</b> of 2 2 m 2 area were placed in each site covering 2. 3 percent of the total transect area. The importance value percentage (IP) of trees> 10 cm DBH, species composition and diversity for both tree and ground flora communities were calculated. The species richness of both the ground flora and tree species was higher in the protected areas. The occurrence of evergreen or tropophyllous trees was greater in the protected area than in the burnt area...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Forest {{vertical}} structure {{is critical to}} ecological function, and provides a crucial link to air- and spaceborne remote sensing (including LiDAR), but is difficult to measure from the <b>ground.</b> Laser point <b>quadrat</b> sampling has been suggested as one alternative, but previous statistical approaches to modeling forest structure using such data have required impractical sample sizes. Here, I develop the theory for maximum likelihood estimation of a parametric model of forest {{vertical structure}}, and illustrate it using inclined point quadrat sampling with a handheld laser. Results from three forest stands in arctic Norway suggest excellent qualitative agreement with structure derived from alternative methods. The approach generalizes readily to other hardware configurations, including terrestrial laser scanning...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{phosphite}} at {{concentrations of}} 2 and 4 g a. i. 1 L {{proved to be}} successful in controlling the spread of Phytophthora cinnamomi within different vegetation communities at Anglesea (Alcoa lease area) and Tidal River (Wilson's Promontory National Park). At nine sites, phosphite was sprayed to runoff with a Solo® 422 motorised backpack sprayer with 2 L 125 m' quadrat. Using aerial and <b>ground</b> photography, <b>quadrats</b> were monitored over a two-year period to determine changes in species abundance due to the pathogen. There was a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the proportions of healthy Xanthorrhoea australis in phosphite sprayed quadrats (2 and 4 g a. i. 1 L with 0. 5 % surfactant) compared to those sprayed with a control (water and 0. 5 % surfactant, water only). Vegetation in quadrats where P. cinnamomi was present was protected by phosphite for 2 years (4 g a. i. IL) and 12 months (2 g a. i. IL). However, vegetation in quadrats where the pathogen was present died where phosphite was not sprayed. Phosphite provided protection for X australis, Isopogon ceratophyllus and Monotoca scoparia (3 species highly susceptible to P. cinnamoml). From the results of this research we recommend the use of phosphite in susceptible vegetation communities with 4 g a. i'!L phosphite to assist with already existing management strategies for the protection of Victorian heathlands and forests from P. cinnamomi...|$|R
40|$|International audience& Context Fragmentation is {{a common}} and {{increasingly}} seri-ous problem in tropical rainforests through the world, resulting in changes in species composition and subsequent species extinctions. & Aim The {{aim of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that changes in species composition can originate from the differ-ent selection pressures on pioneer and climax seeds as the habitat changes. & Methods Baccaurea ramiflora seeds were placed on the <b>ground</b> in six <b>quadrats</b> in five different habitats in the field, while graded temperature and relative humidity treatments in the laboratory were used to mimic the changed microclimate in rainforest fragments. Changes in seed moisture and viabil-ity were monitored. & Results B. ramiflora seeds are recalcitrant and highly sen-sitive to both high temperatures and dehydration, with a reduced lifespan when temperature increased or relative hu-midity decreased, and viability is lost when dehydrated to 0. 198 g/g or warmed to≥ 35 °C. Germination was delayed in non-rainforest conditions compared with the rainforest under-story, and only one-third of the seeds assigned to an open site germinated and emerged. & Conclusion The results support our hypothesis that recalcitrant-seeded species have a high dependence on intact rainforests, and that fragmentation and disturbance will reduce their germination and establishment while favoring orthodox-seeded pioneers...|$|R
40|$|Socotra Cormorants (Phalacrocorax nigrogularis) are {{regionally}} endemic seabirds with restricted distribution. To {{better understand}} their nest selection, we assessed vegetation and soil elements in their nesting areas at Siniya Island of United Arab Emirates. Field sampling was done from three areas (2011 nesting area, 2012 nesting area and control area) in February and March in 2013. Sampling consisted of vegetation assessment {{in the field}} and close-range photography. <b>Ground</b> cover within <b>quadrats</b> was classified into the percent of (1) living cover, (2) dead cover, (3) droppings, (4) bare ground and (5) other. Soil samples were analyzed for thirteen elements. Multivariate stepwise discriminant analysis was performed to determine the importance of the attributes on nest sites. The contribution of Function 1 to the discriminant model was estimated to be 77. 4 %, whereas Function 2 contributed 22. 6 % to the discriminant model (P ≤ 0 : 05). Sites could not be classified adequately using ground cover alone; however, discriminant analysis using soil attributes could better distinguish sites. We noted that Fe and Mn had high discriminant ability in Function 1, whereas Al and Cr showed high discriminant roles for Function 2. The contribution of Function 1 to the model, using soil attributes, was estimated to be 90. 7 % (P ≤ 0 : 05). The combination of ground cover and soil attributes did not improve discrimination of nest sites. Furthermore, some soil variables (Ca, Na, Cd and Cr) were much higher than normal levels in soil, indicating high transport of marine nutrients to nesting sites, which could detrimentally affect surrounding vegetation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to assess the}} {{feasibility}} of a photo imaging approach in the assessment of vegetation condition attributes in comparison with the Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management (QDERM) Vegetation Condition Assessment approach. The project applied both the QDERM BioCondition monitoring method and an alternative photo imaging analysis approach to the assessment of vegetation condition attributes on different regional ecosystems. The study focused on the comparability of results and the cost-effectiveness of the photo imaging approach in comparison to the standard BioCondition assessment method. Six regional ecosystems (RE) sites, of varying structural complexity, were selected for this study. They contained a diverse range of different vegetation attributes. Each site was assessed using both approaches. A low-cost Canon PowerShot SX 10 IS camera was used to collect the photographs. It is equipped with a 20 x Optical Zoom lens with a focal length of 5. 0 - 100 mm that allows shooting a scene from wide-angle to telephoto. For the ground cover data collection, two vertical-down photographs were taken of each quadrat. To capture canopy cover, vertical-up photographs were taken at 5 m intervals along the transect midline. A two pole photographic method was developed to estimate tree canopy height. This study found that the use of photo imaging methods to measure most attributes of vegetation for the BioCondition approach is technically possible. However, their application for operational use in ecosystems with closed vegetation canopies is not feasible. The estimation of the vegetation condition variables is constrained, in various degrees, by several factors. The estimation of shrub species richness in grassland and open canopy forests are the only attributes that have potential for operational use. Canopy cover estimates from vertical-up photographs produced comparable Tree Cover Rank results compared to the manually based crown cover estimate method. The photographic technique also has good potential for estimating major classes of <b>ground</b> cover in <b>quadrats.</b> Canopy height can be estimated more easily by using a laser range finder than a photo imaging method. In the future, when the cost of data acquisition becomes less expensive, the suitability of a LiDAR system could be considered to quantify the desired vegetation attributes. ...|$|R
