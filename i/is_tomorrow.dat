25|$|In the 1950s, the London-based Independent Group formed; {{from which}} pop art emerged in 1956 with the {{exhibition}} at the Institute of Contemporary Arts This <b>Is</b> <b>Tomorrow,</b> as a British reaction to abstract expressionism. The International Group was the topic of a two-day, international conference at the Tate Britain in March 2007. The Independent Group {{is regarded as the}} precursor to the Pop Art movement in Britain and the United States. The This <b>is</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> show featured Scottish artist Eduardo Paolozzi, Richard Hamilton, and artist John McHale amongst others, and the group included the influential art critic Lawrence Alloway as well.|$|E
25|$|Just {{what is it}} {{that makes}} today's homes so different, so appealing? was created in 1956 for the {{catalogue}} of the This <b>Is</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> exhibition in London, England in which it was reproduced in black and white. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit. Richard Hamilton has subsequently created several works in which he reworked the subject and composition of the pop art collage, including a 1992 version featuring a female bodybuilder. Many artists have created derivative works of Hamilton's collage. P. C. Helm made a year 2000 interpretation.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} This <b>Is</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> secured Hamilton further {{teaching}} assignments in particular at the Royal College of Art from 1957 to 1961, where he promoted David Hockney and Peter Blake. During this period Hamilton {{was also very}} active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and produced a work parodying the then leader of the Labour Party Hugh Gaitskell for rejecting a policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. In the early 1960s he received {{a grant from the}} Arts Council to investigate the condition of the Kurt Schwitters Merzbau in Cumbria. The research eventually resulted in Hamilton organising the preservation of the work by relocating it to the Hatton Gallery in the Newcastle University.|$|E

500|$|On November 16, 2009, {{the paper}} was {{abruptly}} shut down because of the financial status of its parent company, Window Media, and its majority shareholder, Avalon Equity Partners. [...] Employees at the Blade were aware of Window Media's financial troubles, but the timing and total closure of the publication {{came as a shock}} to the entire staff. [...] Kevin Naff, editor of the Blade, said employees [...] "found out when two of the corporate officers were waiting for us when we got to work this morning". [...] Since the Blade had been a profitable newspaper, and because the debt-ridden Window Media was no longer draining the publication's finances, the same day the Blade shut down, Naff told the Washington City Paper he and the remaining staffers [...] "We're all together. Our first meeting for our new venture <b>is</b> <b>tomorrow</b> morning." [...] Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton said the Blade had been a [...] "weekly must-read", and pledged support for a new publication to serve Washington's LGBT community.|$|E

2500|$|Richard [...] William Hamilton CH (24 February 1922 [...] 13 September 2011) was an English {{painter and}} collage artist. His 1955 {{exhibition}} Man, Machine and Motion (Hatton Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne) and his 1956 collage Just {{what is it}} that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?, produced for the This <b>Is</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> exhibition of the Independent Group in London, are considered by critics and historians to be among the earliest works of pop art. A major retrospective of his work was at Tate Modern until May 2014.|$|E

2500|$|The {{post at the}} ICA also afforded Hamilton {{the time}} to further his {{research}} on Duchamp, {{which resulted in the}} 1960 publication of a typographic version of Duchamp's Green Box, which comprised Duchamp's original notes for the design and construction of his famous work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, also known as The Large Glass. Hamilton's 1955 exhibition of paintings at the Hanover Gallery were all in some form a homage to Duchamp. In the same year Hamilton organized the exhibition Man Machine Motion at the Hatton Gallery in Newcastle. Designed to look more like an advertising display than a conventional art exhibition the show prefigured Hamilton's contribution to the This <b>Is</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> exhibition in London, at the Whitechapel Gallery the following year. Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? was created in 1956 for the catalogue of This <b>Is</b> <b>Tomorrow,</b> where it was reproduced in black and white and also used in posters for the exhibit. The collage depicts a muscle-man provocatively holding a Tootsie Pop and a woman with large, bare breasts wearing a lampshade hat, surrounded by emblems of 1950s affluence from a vacuum cleaner to a large canned ham. Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? is widely acknowledged {{as one of the first}} pieces of Pop Art. Hamilton's written definition of what [...] "pop" [...] is laid the ground for the whole international movement. Hamilton's definition of Pop Art from a letter to Alison and Peter Smithson dated 16 January 1957 was: [...] "Pop Art is: popular, transient, expendable, low-cost, mass-produced, young, witty, sexy, gimmicky, glamorous, and Big Business", stressing its everyday, commonplace values. He thus created collages incorporating advertisements from mass-circulation newspapers and magazines.|$|E

6000|$|... 3-4 October, {{close to}} midnight.--I thought {{yesterday}} would never end. There was over me a yearning for sleep, {{in some sort}} of blind belief that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must now be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one earth box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years. And in the meantime, the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now. This I know, that {{if ever there was a}} woman who was all perfection, that one is my poor wronged darling. I loved her a thousand times more for her sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March. I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy myself, though I am weary [...] . weary to death. However, I must try to sleep. For there <b>is</b> <b>tomorrow</b> to think of, and there is no rest for me until [...] .|$|E
