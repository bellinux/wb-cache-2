5|$|A jonline {{can also}} be used to tether the diver's <b>{{equipment}}</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dive boat before or after the dive. This helps the diver to put on or take off the equipment while in the water without drifting away from the boat. It is similar to a buddy line, which is used to tether two divers together during a dive.|$|E
5|$|By late October, the German {{forces were}} worn out, {{with only a}} third of their motor {{vehicles}} still functioning, infantry divisions at third- to half-strength, and serious logistics issues preventing the delivery of warm clothing and other winter <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front. Even Hitler seemed to surrender {{to the idea of a}} long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks into such a large city without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly capture of Warsaw in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to capture}} weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were {{conducted}} on trains carrying <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front, {{as well as on}} guardhouses and gendarmerie posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.|$|E

5|$|Endeavour docked {{with the}} ISS on 2 December 2000, on mission STS-97, {{bringing}} four more Americans and a Canadian temporarily to the station. The shuttle also brought the {{first pair of}} U.S. provided photovoltaic arrays, which would provide crucial electricity for further development of the station. In total, STS-97 brought 17tons of <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ISS, which also included expandable metal girders, batteries, electronics and cooling equipment.|$|E
5|$|Numerous small {{parks are}} {{throughout}} {{all parts of}} Hamersley, usually joining the ends of several cul-de-sacs {{and in some cases}} containing wooden benches or children's play equipment. The Rannoch-Tay-Earn reserve in eastern Hamersley also contains two barbecues. The introduction of a barbecue and new playground <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reserve first came in the late 1990s. 2008–2009 has seen the introduction of a new barbecue area due west of the playground with more introductions to the reserve to come.|$|E
5|$|The Shuttle is {{the first}} orbital {{spacecraft}} designed for partial reusability. It carries large payloads to various orbits, and, during the Shuttle–Mir and ISS programs, provides crew rotation and carries various supplies, modules and pieces of <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stations. Each Shuttle was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or 10 years' operational life.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Geneva Accord {{requiring}} {{an immediate}} withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind for {{seven to eight}} months. When its troops eventually pulled out, JNA left their <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> RSK. As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire, the UNPROFOR, did not start to deploy until 8 March. The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble in the UNPAs. The UNPROFOR was tasked with demilitarisation of the UNPAs, ceasefire maintenance, monitoring of local police and creating conditions for return of internally displaced persons and refugees. Those comprised more than 300,000 Croats who were exiled from the RSK-controlled territory, and 20,000 Serbs who fled the areas of western Slavonia captured by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) in Operations Swath-10, Papuk-91 and Hurricane-91 in late 1991.|$|E
5|$|Determined Egyptian {{resistance}} {{made progress}} extremely slow for the Israelis, who suffered heavy losses. The Israelis were repeatedly reinforced with armor but {{were unable to}} make much headway, only managing to seize an important crossroad on the second day. Suffering {{from a lack of}} infantry, the Israelis brought up paratroopers during the night of October 16/17. They were tasked with clearing anti-tank defenses for the armor, but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire. The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention long enough for the Israelis to move bridging <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canal undetected. Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers.|$|E
5|$|During {{their time}} on the Western Front, No. 2 and No 4. Squadrons had been used mainly in the fighter role, while No. 3 Squadron was {{primarily}} used for reconnaissance. No. 4 Squadron became the most successful fighter squadron in France, accounting for 199 enemy aircraft, while No. 2 Squadron was credited with the destruction of 185. The total AFC casualties on the Western Front included 78 killed, 68 wounded and 33 taken prisoner. Following {{the end of the}} war on 11 November 1918, No. 4 Squadron was the only Australian unit assigned to the British Army of Occupation, arriving in Germany in December and being based in Cologne. The three AFC squadrons subsequently handed over their <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> RAF in February 1919 and returned to Australia where they disbanded.|$|E

5|$|Early {{mediation}} {{attempts in}} March 1499 had failed because of mutual distrust between the parties. But {{after the battle}} of Dornach, the Swabian League was war-weary and had lost all confidence in the king's abilities as a military leader, and thus refused Maximilian's demands to muster a new army. The Swabian and Habsburg armies had suffered far higher human losses than the Swiss, and were also short on artillery, after repeatedly having lost their <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Swiss. The Swiss also had no interest to prolong the war further, though they refused a first peace proposal that Maximilian presented at Schaffhausen in August 1499.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 Neubronner {{completed}} his task (set in 1909) of photographing the waterworks at Tegel using only his mobile dovecote. Almost 10 years of negotiations {{were scheduled to}} end in August 1914 with a practical test at a maneuver in Strasbourg, followed by the state's acquisition of the invention. These plans were thwarted by {{the outbreak of the}} war. Neubronner had to provide all his pigeons and <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military, which tested them in the battlefield with satisfactory results, but did not employ the technique more widely.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Titterton {{stepped down}} as Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences, and became an {{ordinary}} professor. Once again he spearheaded a proposal to upgrade the department's equipment, this time by using the tandem as an injector for a superconducting linear accelerator. Unable to secure funding in Australia, he managed to persuade the British Science Research Council to donate the required <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ANU from facilities in England that were being closed down. It was installed and commissioned after his death. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1957, and was created a knight bachelor on 1 January 1970.|$|E

On 5 November 1943, she {{was hit by}} a torpedo, but the damage was light, other than the disabled rudder. The ship was under repair and refit until 29 February 1944 at Kure. The air groups of both carriers were reconstituted at Singapore on 1 November. The aircraft transferred to Truk on 1 December and then to Kavieng at the end of December before reaching Rabaul on 25 January 1944; the survivors were back at Truk on 20 February and the air group was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|On 10 December, {{the ship}} carried the Westland Whirlwinds of 848 Squadron to Singapore, {{arriving}} on 8 January 1953. She arrived back at Portsmouth on 11 February and then embarked {{part of the}} 100 Grumman Avengers transferred to the Royal Navy {{under the terms of}} the Mutual Defense Assistance Act in Norfolk, Virginia on 16 March. She arrived back in Norfolk to load the remaining aircraft on 29 April. Perseus was fitted with temporary grandstand seating ("bleachers") in June for Very Important Persons and the press during Elizabeth II's Coronation Fleet Review in Spithead. Later in the year she made a trip transporting troops and <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Far East.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2012, Egypt {{had sent}} athletes to {{nineteen}} {{editions of the}} Summer Olympic Games, the 1906 Intercalated Games, equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics, and the 1984 Winter Olympics. Before the Games began, the Egyptian Olympic Committee distributed counterfeit Nike gear to its athletes, due to its financial troubles following the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Nike, however, ended up donating legitimate <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Egyptians. Tamer Bayoumi, a 2004 Olympic bronze medalist and the nation’s most successful taekwondo practitioner at the 2012 Games, was chosen to carry Egypt’s flag at the closing ceremony.|$|E

5|$|The JNA {{withdrew from}} Croatia in 1992, but {{continued}} to contribute personnel and <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Army of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (ARSK) which controlled the areas previously held by the JNA. Although the United Nations Protection Force peacekeepers deployed to the area {{on the basis of}} the Vance plan and placed most of the ARSK heavy weapons in storage, Osijek was intermittently bombarded throughout the war—the last artillery strike occurred in September 1995. The hostilities ceased in November 1995 through the Erdut Agreement securing restoration of Croatian rule in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{set their}} next major attempt to {{recapture}} Henderson Field for 20 October and moved {{most of the}} 2nd and 38th infantry divisions, totalling 17,500 troops, from the Dutch East Indies to Rabaul in preparation for delivering them to Guadalcanal. From 14 September to 9 October, numerous Tokyo Express runs delivered troops from the Japanese 2nd Infantry Division as well as Hyakutake to Guadalcanal. In addition to cruisers and destroyers, some of these runs included the seaplane carrier , which delivered heavy <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island including vehicles and heavy artillery other warships could not carry because of space limitations. The Japanese Navy promised to support the Army's planned offensive by delivering the necessary troops, equipment, and supplies to the island, and by stepping up air attacks on Henderson Field and sending warships to bombard the airfield.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister took {{other steps}} to deter Hitler from aggression. He doubled {{the size of}} the Territorial Army, created a Ministry of Supply to {{expedite}} the provision of <b>equipment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> armed forces, and instituted peacetime conscription. The Italian invasion of Albania on 7 April 1939 led to guarantees being given to Greece and Romania. On 17 June 1939, Handley Page received an order for 200 Hampden twin-engined medium bombers, and by 3 September 1939, the chain of radar stations girdling the British coast was fully operational.|$|E
