5|$|Rhodium finds use in {{jewelry and}} for decorations. It is {{electroplated}} on white gold and platinum {{to give it}} a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium <b>flashing</b> <b>in</b> the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because of the difficulty of fabrication (high melting point and poor malleability) than because of the high price. The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an electroplate.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} mysterious man holding a briefcase, walking down a futuristic hallway. As the music starts, the girls start dancing in a dark office with lights <b>flashing</b> <b>in</b> the background. As the chorus starts, the girls start {{shooting}} laser beams from their fingers, and dance to the song. The girls teleport into the futuristic labyrinth, looking for {{the man with the}} briefcase. Inter cut scenes features the group dancing and singing to the song, whilst in several different hallways. During the second chorus, the girls continue to search for him without any luck. The man enters the office, sits down on a sofa, with a helmet piece of shiny–coloured plastic on his head. The girls find the office entrance, with CCTV footage catching them enter the room.|$|E
25|$|Headlight <b>{{flashing}}</b> <b>in</b> India {{is often}} used as a signal that the driver flashing you is offering {{to let you go}} first. Such use is however strongly discouraged because it can lead to accidents where the driver flashing has not seen the approach of another road user. It is also used to indicate to an oncoming vehicle to either stop or give way in narrow lanes.|$|E

25|$|In July 1998, amateur {{observers}} in Texas observed an unidentified object <b>flashing</b> <b>in</b> geosynchronous orbit. The object was subsequently lost, however it was rediscovered in June 2000 when its flashes became brighter; some even visible {{with the naked}} eye. Following the 2000 observations amateur observers were still unable to identify the satellite, so began referring to it by the pseudo International Designator 2000-653A and pseudo Satellite Catalog Number 90007.|$|E
25|$|Headlight <b>{{flashing}}</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom {{is often}} used as a signal that the driver flashing you is offering {{to let you go}} first. Such use is however strongly discouraged because it can lead to accidents where the driver flashing has not seen the approach of another road user. Using it to indicate that you are coming through and the other driver must wait, could lead to an accident.|$|E
25|$|Other {{luminescent}} systems: Early in {{his career}} Hastings developed techniques to quantify the level of oxygen required in a luminescent reaction for several different species including bacteria, fungi, fireflies and ostracod crustaceans. This work showed that oxygen gating is the mechanism for firefly <b>flashing.</b> <b>In</b> other work {{when he was in}} the McElroy lab he examined the basic biochemical mechanism of firefly luciferase and demonstrated that coenzyme A stimulates light emission. His lab first demonstrated that the green in vivo coelenterate bioluminescence occurs because of energy transfer from the luminescent molecule (aequorin), which alone emits blue light, to a secondary green emitter which they termed green fluorescent protein (GFP). Once characterized and cloned, GFP has become a crucial molecule used as a reporter and tagging tool for studying gene activation and developmental patterns. Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008 for their work on this remarkable molecule.|$|E

500|$|Weezer {{turned down}} a video {{treatment}} for lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] proposed by Spike Jonze, who had previously helped raise the band's status with his videos for [...] "Undone – The Sweater Song" [...] and [...] "Buddy Holly". Cuomo explained: [...] "I really don't want the songs to come across untainted this time around... I really want to communicate my feelings directly and because I was so careful in writing that way. I'd hate for the video to kinda misrepresent the song, or exaggerate certain aspects." [...] The final video featured the band playing in an assembly hall in Los Angeles, surrounded by light fixtures <b>flashing</b> <b>in</b> time to the music. Mark Romanek, the video's director, quit after numerous arguments with Cuomo, leaving Cuomo to edit the video himself. The video debuted on MTV's 120 Minutes and received moderate airplay.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{went through}} several changes in production: working titles {{included}} [...] "Old Friends" [...] and [...] "Black Ops", {{the latter being}} set in an army base. Davies requested that Whithouse set it in a school instead, mainly for simplicity, but also for a desire for the Doctor to masquerade as a school teacher. Additionally, the Krillitanes were to be named [...] "Krillians" [...] until the BBC found the name was trademarked, and Finch's forename was originally Hector, until the BBC found a real teacher by the same name, and renamed him Lucas. K9's eye grill was initially filmed <b>flashing</b> <b>in</b> sync with his lines, not unlike the Daleks, until Phil Collinson saw the footage and nixed the practice (which was inconsistent with the robot dog's past appearances). A scene that was cut was of Milo's brain being [...] "shorted out" [...] by the Doctor's rapid-fire questions {{at the beginning of}} the episode, which was later alluded to in the episode.|$|E
500|$|The Gallagher {{brothers}} famously share {{a turbulent}} relationship; {{one of their}} arguments was even released on a 1995 bootleg single titled Wibbling Rivalry. Although in recent years their relationship had stabilised, during the band's early career there were a handful of incidents where the two have actually come to blows. In an L.A. show during their first American tour in 1994, Liam took to changing {{the words of the}} songs so that they were offensive to both Americans and Noel. A confrontation after the show which led to a chair being thrown and a brawl caused him to leave the tour and head for Las Vegas; Gallagher later claimed he had [...] "visions of Fear and Loathing <b>flashing</b> <b>in</b> [...] eyes". During recording sessions for the second Oasis album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, the brothers had a violent fight involving a cricket bat, when Liam invited everyone from a local pub back into the studio while he was trying to work. In 1995, Noel was obliged to sing [...] "Wonderwall" [...] on Later... with Jools Holland when Liam failed to turn up.|$|E

500|$|... "Ultraviolet" [...] {{is unusual}} in that the band has only ever played it in concert {{as part of an}} encore, usually {{preceding}} [...] "With or Without You". It was first performed at Lakeland Arena in Lakeland, Florida on 29 February 1992 {{at the start of the}} Zoo TV Tour, and it remained a staple of the band's set lists for the first four legs of the tour, often preceded by a prank call by Bono as his alter-egos Mirror Ball Man or Mr. MacPhisto. The Edge played the song on his Gibson Explorer. [...] It was staged with silver-and-mauve lights thrown against two glitter balls, causing light fragments to swirl around the audience, and with lasers <b>flashing</b> <b>in</b> quick rhythms. [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone characterised its essence as [...] "desperately searching" [...] and said that it helped transition the Zoo TV show towards an ambiguous, introspective conclusion. [...] It became writer Beeaff's favourite live song on the tour, with Bono's intense, unrestrained singing producing a strong communal energy; she singled out the March 1992 Hampton Coliseum show as one in which Bono's fervent performance approached the point of emotional breakdown and generated [...] "a transcendent and draining experience for everyone." [...] Although acknowledging the song is an [...] "epic ... with some gorgeous aspects", Edge has said the song is unwieldy to play live. [...] During Zoo TV, almost all of the numbers from Achtung Baby (and the rest of the set list) were augmented by sequencers to fill out the sound; on [...] "Ultraviolet", under-the-stage keyboard tech Des Broadberry playing a sampled guitar figure in the background during Edge's solo parts. [...] Its last performance as part of the tour was on 28 August 1993 in Dublin, after which the song was retired and did not appear on any of U2's next three subsequent tours (PopMart, Elevation, and Vertigo).|$|E
500|$|To {{deal with}} these limitations, Frye {{simplified}} the maze's intricate pattern of corridors to a more repetitive pattern. The small tan pellets in the arcade original were changed to rectangular [...] "wafers" [...] that shared the wall color on the 2600, a change necessitated because both the pellets and walls were drawn with the 2600's Playfield graphics, which have a fixed width. To achieve the visual effect of wafers disappearing as Pac-Man eats them, the actual map of the maze was updated as the data was written into the Playfield registers, excluding those pellets that had been eaten. The 2600's Player-Missile graphics system (sprites) {{were used for the}} remaining objects, the one pixel-wide Missiles were used to render the flashing power pills and the center of the vitamin. [...] Pac-Man and ghost characters were implemented using the 2600's two Player objects, with one being used for Pac-Man and the other being used in for all four ghosts, with the result that each ghost only appears once out of every four frames, which creates a flickering effect. This effect takes advantage of the slow phosphorescent fade of CRT monitors and the concept of persistence of vision, resulting in the image appearing to linger on screen longer, but the flickering remains noticeable, and makes each individual ghost's color nearly impossible to discern. Frye chose to abandon plans for a flicker-management system to minimize the <b>flashing</b> <b>in</b> part because Atari didn't seem to care about that issue in its zeal to have the game released. His game also did not conform to the arcade game's color scheme in order to comply with Atari's official home product policy that only space type games should feature black backgrounds. [...] Another quality-impact was his decision that two-player gameplay was important, which meant that the 23 bytes required to store the current difficulty, state of the dots on the current maze, remaining lives, and score had to be doubled for a second player, consuming 46 of the 2600's meager 128 byte memory, which precluded its use for additional game data and features.|$|E
2500|$|Photosensitive {{epilepsy}} - This is an epileptic {{reaction to}} flashing lights in susceptible persons, which can range in severity from an unusual feeling or involuntary twitch to a generalized seizure. [...] This epileptogenic response can {{be triggered by}} lights <b>flashing</b> <b>in</b> the frequency range of 10–20Hz, regardless of color. [...] While individual light sources used on emergency vehicles generally have much lower flash rates than this, the Loughborough study suggests that such possibilities be minimized. [...] It also notes that emergency workers may report distraction and eyestrain unrelated to epilepsy from working under the lights.|$|E

2500|$|Turn {{signals are}} {{required}} to blink on and off, or [...] "flash", at a steady rate of between 60 and 120 blinks per minute (1–2Hz). International UN Regulations require that all turn signals flash in simultaneous phase; US regulations permit side marker lights wired for side turn signal functionality to flash in opposite-phase. An audio and/or visual tell-tale indicator is required, to advise the driver when the turn signals are activated and operating. This usually {{takes the form of}} one or two green indicator lights on the vehicle's instrument cluster, and a cyclical [...] "tick-tock" [...] noise generated electromechanically or electronically. It is also required that the vehicle operator be alerted by much faster- or slower-than-normal <b>flashing</b> <b>in</b> the event a turn signal light fails.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{well-documented}} {{instance to}} specifically compare the objects to saucers was the Kenneth Arnold sighting on June 24, 1947, while Arnold was flying near Mount Rainier. He reported seeing 9 brightly reflecting vehicles, one {{shaped like a}} crescent but the others more disc- or saucer-shaped, flying in an echelon formation, weaving like {{the tail of a}} kite, flipping and <b>flashing</b> <b>in</b> the sun, and traveling with a speed of at least 1,200 miles per hour (1,900km/h). In addition to the saucer or disc shape (Arnold also used the terms [...] "pie plate" [...] and half-moon shaped), he also later said he described the motion of the craft as [...] "like a saucer if you skip it across water", leading to the term [...] "flying saucer" [...] and also [...] "flying disc" [...] (which were synonymous for a number of years).|$|E
