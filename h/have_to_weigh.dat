5|$|The main storyline in TNA's X Division {{revolved}} around Team 3D's (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) attempt {{to eliminate the}} X Division. This feud began on the October 18, 2007 episode of Impact! when Team 3D attacked The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin; MCMG) and proclaimed {{they were going to}} eliminate the X Division. MCMG went on to defeat Team 3D at TNA's Genesis PPV event on November 11, 2007. At the same event, Team 3D attacked and stole the TNA X Division Championship from then-champion Jay Lethal. On the November 15, 2007 episode of Impact!, Johnny Devine turned on the X Division and joined Team 3D in their quest. Team 3D and Devine went on to defeat Lethal and MCMG in a Six Man Tag Team Tables Match at TNA's Turning Point PPV event on December 2, 2007. The two teams then faced again at Final Resolution in a Six Man Tag Team Ultimate X match, which Team 3D and Devine won. On the January 10, 2008 episode of Impact!, Devine and Team 3D challenged Lethal and MCMG to a Street Fight at Against All Odds, with the stipulation that if Team 3D won the X Division would disband, but if Lethal and MCMG won they would regain possession of the TNA X Division Championship and the X Division would continue to exist.

60|$|Long have I {{wished to}} see a fair and {{philosophical}} inquisition into the character of Wordsworth, as a poet, on the evidence of his published works; and a positive, not a comparative, appreciation of their characteristic excellencies, deficiencies, and defects. I know no claim that the mere opinion of any individual can <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> down {{the opinion of the}} author himself; against the probability of whose parental partiality we ought to set that of his having thought longer and more deeply on the subject. But I should call that investigation fair and philosophical in which the critic announces and endeavours to establish the principles, which he holds for the foundation of poetry in general, with the specification of these in their application to the different classes of poetry. Having thus prepared his canons of criticism for praise and condemnation, he would proceed to particularize the most striking passages to which he deems them applicable, faithfully noticing the frequent or infrequent recurrence of similar merits or defects, and as faithfully distinguishing what is characteristic from what is accidental, or a mere flagging of the wing. Then if his premises be rational, his deductions legitimate, and his conclusions justly applied, the reader, and possibly the poet himself, may adopt his judgment in the light of judgment and in the independence of free-agency. If he has erred, he presents his errors in a definite place and tangible form, and holds the torch and guides the way to their detection.|$|E

5000|$|According to Wang Xue Qin, a noted {{expert on}} the Chinese futures market and also the vice general {{economist}} of Zhengzhou Commodities Exchange, in theory, a new contract can be listed upon approval by the CSRC.

5000|$|The cockpit {{has been}} {{described}} as being relatively noisy, but also often praised for the provision of excellent external visibility; Flight Magazine stated that [...] "It is almost like being in a four-place open cockpit plane". Typically, the Rallye would be furnished with dual flying controls, each being complete with their own control stick, upon which controls for the intercom would be often mounted. While fully-featured cockpit instrumentation was an available option to be installed upon the Rallye, the additional weight of this equipment would noticeably impact the aircraft's performance; thus,customers would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> up the benefits of having superior flight performance or being able to make use of greater amount of cockpit features.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species is}} one of the medium priced dwarf {{angelfish}} with sales prices usually ranging from $50 to $100 per specimen (2010). Availability may vary but P. multifasciata cannot be considered [...] "rare" [...] in the trade. They usually arrive in fish stores in good health, problems can however arise when keeping them in sterile quarantine settings without live rock where not enough food can be found, as barred angelfish often do not accept artificial or frozen foods initially. Aquarists will therefore <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> the risks of skipping quarantine. Applying freshwater dips before placing P. multifasciata in their tanks is usually sufficient to prevent the introduction of protozoans via these fish.|$|E

50|$|The pistol {{is named}} after the FP-45 Liberator, a single-shot pistol that George Hyde {{designed}} and that the Inland Manufacturing Division of the General Motors Corporation mass-produced for the United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in World War II. The OSS intended to air drop the gun into occupied Europe for resistance forces to use. A project of the OSS (which would later become the CIA), it is thought the Liberator was equally purposed {{as a tool of}} psychological warfare. Occupying forces in Europe would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> evidence of distributed pistols as a factor in planning against civilian resistance, which would complicate their strategy and affect morale. However, though used in France, there is little proof that the pistols were ever dropped into occupied Europe in large quantities.|$|E

I am delighted to be given this chance and I am really looking forward to being part of the squad".|$|E
50|$|The {{terminations}} of the First World War and the Second World War both {{resulted in}} temporary booms for the ship breaking industry {{as hundreds of}} worn-out or obsolete warships were sold for disposal. In the 1930s, it became cheaper to 'beach' a boat and run her ashore as opposed to using a dry dock. The ship would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> {{as little as possible}} and run ashore at full speed. Dismantling operations required a 10 feet rise of tide and close proximity to a steel-works. Electric shears, a wrecking ball and oxy-acetylene torches were used. The technique of the time is almost identical to that of developing countries today. Similarly, Thos W Ward Ltd., one of the largest breakers in the United Kingdom in the 1930s, would recondition and sell all furniture and machinery. Many historical artefacts were sold at public auctions: the Cunarder Mauretania received high bids for her fittings worldwide. However, even with obsolete technology, any weapons and military information were carefully removed.|$|E
5000|$|Lord Bingham noted that,"Any evidence, to be admissible, must be relevant. Contested trials {{last long}} enough {{as it is}} without {{spending}} time on evidence which is irrelevant and cannot affect the outcome. Relevance must, and can only, be judged by reference to the issue which the court (whether judge or jury) is called upon to decide. As Lord Simon of Glaisdale observed in Director of Public Prosecutions v Kilbourne 1973 AC 729, 756, [...] "Evidence is relevant if it is logically probative or disprobative of some matter which requires proof â€¦.. relevant (ie. logically probative or disprobative) evidence is evidence which makes the matter which requires proof more or less probable"."Lord Bingham then concluded that evidence must satisfy a two-stage test before being admitted in a civil case. Firstly, it will be legally admissible if it is probative of a relevant matter. Secondly, judges will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> the argument in favour of admitting the evidence against any arguments against admitting it, such as, the evidence relates to a collateral matter, is potentially prejudicial or unduly burdensome.|$|E
