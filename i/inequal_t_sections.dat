40|$|In {{this study}} the heat {{transfer}} and hydrodynamic parameters were experimentally investigated {{for a single}} microchannel housed in a stainless steel solid base material for different aspect ratios in the laminar regime with water as the working fluid. The stainless steel base material had a low thermal conductivity (15. 1 W / mK) which magnified the conjugative effects {{in order to better}} understand the heat transfer. Rectangular microchannels with a height and width of 0. 64 mm x 0. 41 mm for <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> 1, 0. 5 mm x 0. 5 mm for <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> 2 and 0. 43 mm x 0. 58 mm for <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> 3 were considered. The overall width of the solid substrate was 1. 5 mm and the length was 50 mm for all of the test sections. The aspect ratio of the channel and the solid substrate was kept equal. A constant heat flux of 10 W / cm 2 was applied to the bottom outer wall of the test section. A sudden contraction inlet and a sudden expansion outlet manifold contained pressure ports, to measure the pressure drop across the test sections, and thermocouples measured the mean inlet and outlet fluid temperatures. Thermocouples were used to measure the outer top and side wall temperatures at four equally spaced positions along the axial direction. The amount of axial heat conduction was below 0. 6 % for all of the test sections and therefore warranted the use of a two-dimensional conduction model to determine the heat transfer parameters at the fluid to solid interface based on the outer measured wall temperatures. The local Nusselt number decreased, along the axial direction but increased towards the exit for all of the test sections. The average Nusselt number increased with the flow rate and the critical Reynolds number for fully turbulent flow <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> 1 was 1950, for <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> 2 was 2250 and for <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> 3 was 1650. The average Nusselt number was directly related to the perimeter of the microchannels two side walls and the bottom wall (not the top wall), and thus decreased as the aspect ratio of the channel increased. The experimentally determined Nusselt numbers were larger for all three test sections when compared to common acceptable correlations. The friction factor decreased with the flow rate and was smaller in magnitude when compared to conventional theories. The diabatic friction factor magnitudes were smaller than the adiabatic friction factors. The friction factor decreased as the aspect ratio decreased, where the aspect ratio was calculated by taking the maximum of the microchannels width or height, divided by the minimum of the two. The possibility of a relationship could exist between the Colburn j-factor and the friction factor when considering the results for <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> 1 and <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> 2 but the results for <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> 3 were significantly different.

40|$|The {{specific}} {{objective of this}} research was to determine the drag coefficient of a representative section of a water bed conveyor. This involved the investigation of the drag on a flexible membrane form in a confined open channel. Dimensional analysis was used as a basis for the design of the physical model of the water bed conveyor. The physical model was designed, constructed and installed within a flume. Testing of the physical model consisted of measuring the drag force on the <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> and velocity distribution within the boundary layer developing along the <b>Test</b> <b>Section.</b> The measurements were undertaken while the <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> was loaded with various quantities of different material types. The <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> was fixed in the direction of flow by one load cell, while water was pumped through the flume at 25 l/s, 38 l/s and 63 l s. Momentum principle and the velocity data were used to calculate the drag force on the Test Section; this was then compared with the drag force recorded directly. The drag coefficient was calculated and comparisons were made to establish whether the tension in the membrane and/or the material type set-ups affected the drag coefficient.

40|$|In April 1999, three {{identical}} superheater test {{sections were}} installed into the Niles Unit No. 1 {{for the purpose}} of testing and ranking the coal ash corrosion resistance of candidate superheater alloys. The Niles boiler burns high sulfur coal (3 % to 3. 5 %) that has a moderate alkali content (0. 2 % sodium equivalents), thus the constituents necessary for coal ash corrosion are present in the ash. The test sections were controlled to operate with an average surface metal temperature from approximately 1060 F to 1210 F which was within the temperature range over which coal ash corrosion occurs. Thus, this combination of aggressive environment and high temperature was appropriate for testing the performance of candidate corrosion-resistant tube materials. Analyses of the deposit and scale confirmed that aggressive alkali sulfate constituents were present at the metal surface and active in tube metal wastage. The test sections were constructed so that the response of twelve different candidate tube and/or coating materials could be studied. The plan was to remove and evaluate one of the three test sections at time intervals of 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years. This would permit an assessment of performance of the candidate materials as a function of time. <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> A was removed in November 2001 after about 24 months of service at the desired steam temperature set point, with about 15. 5 months of exposure at full temperature. A progress report, issued in October 2002, was written to document the performance of the candidate alloys in that test section. The evaluation described the condition of each tube sample after exposure. It involved a determination of the rate of wall thickness loss for these samples. In cases where there was more than one sample of a candidate material in the test section, an assessment was made of the performance of the alloy as a function of temperature. <b>Test</b> <b>Sections</b> B and C were examined during the November 2001 outage, and it was decided that, due to excessive wastage, certain tube samples needed to be removed and replaced {{in order to ensure that}} <b>Test</b> <b>Sections</b> B and C would have a chance of remaining in the boiler for their intended exposure period. These suspect tube samples were replaced and the two remaining test sections were put back into service. The tube samples that were removed from <b>Test</b> <b>Sections</b> B and C were set aside for later analysis at the end of the planned exposure period. <b>Test</b> <b>Sections</b> B and C were again examined approximately six months later. At that time, measured wall thickness losses raised concerns about additional tube samples. These suspect samples were also removed, set aside for later analysis, and replaced. The test sections then went back into service until the end of the second exposure period, which was concluded in May 2003 when, due to evidence of excessive wastage, the valves were opened increasing cooling steam flow and thereby effectively stopping corrosion. In August 2003, <b>Test</b> <b>Sections</b> B and C were removed for closer examination. Section C had experienced about 42 months of service at the desired team temperature set point with 28. 5 months at temperature at full temperature. Additional suspect samples were removed from <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> B, then, it was re-installed into the boiler (at the location originally occupied by Section C), where it remained in service until the end of the program. Due to this removal history, the samples from <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> B had a total service duration that varied from a minimum of 15. 5 months (for samples that performed poorly) to 37 months for samples the survived for the full intended service exposure for Section B. The figure below shows a schematic of <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> B and indicates the length of service exposure for different locations. This report provides the results of the evaluation of <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> B, including the samples that remained in the <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> for the full exposure period as well as those that were removed early. This report also is intended to compare and summarize the results for all three test sections. The analysis of <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> B followed much the same protocol that was employed in the assessment of the other two test sections. The focus was on determining and documenting the relative corrosion rates of the candidate materials; however, additional investigations were undertaken to better understand the wastage mechanism, and to characterize how selected candidate materials performed either well, or poorly, in the severe coal ash corrosion environment in the convection pass of Niles Unit No. 1. The detailed results of the investigation are included in this report as a series of twelve appendices. Each appendix is devoted to the performance of one of the candidate alloys.
