5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.|$|E

Meanwhile, Alan and Joanna, after walking into the sea, are last seen hanging onto a buoy waiting to drown. They are still talking and waiting for the ocean to drown them.|$|E

"One of us can't walk," [...] said Martin; [...] "still, perhaps I can manage," [...] and, lifting Foy in {{his arms}} {{as though he had}} been a baby, he passed with the jailers out of <b>the</b> den, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> <b>and</b> into <b>the</b> court-room. Here, seated behind a table, they found Ramiro and the little, squeaky-voiced, red-faced Inquisitor.|$|R

500|$|Both {{exchanged}} heated {{words as}} he was about to depart, a rifle shot in the plaza rang out.

Janolino swung his bolo at Luna, wounding him in the head. Janolino's men fired at Luna, while others started stabbing him, even as he tried to fire his revolver at one of his attackers.

500|$|To {{depict the}} supernatural {{aspects of the}} show, the series makes use of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. Businesses, such as visual effects company Entity FX, were {{contracted}} for production of the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes were filmed in Vancouver and required a new crew that works exclusively for the show. Mary Winchester's death scene, which had the character pinned to the ceiling and burning to death, required actress Samantha Smith to lie on a floor with two propane pipes spouting fire approximately five feet away from her on either side. For the actual burning of the character, a fake body the crew named [...] "Christina" [...] was made out of wire and papier-mÃ¢chÃ©, and was then ignited on a fake ceiling. However, the room quickly caught fire, forcing an evacuation. Green screen coincided with the visual effects for the ghostly Woman in White, and executive producer McG chose to make the imagery of her death sequence an homage to Chris Cunningham's Aphex Twin video [...] "Windowlicker". Japanese horror also influenced the scene, such as the school uniforms worn by the ghost children, the water cascading <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> the Dark Water elements.|$|E
500|$|An unused {{scene was}} drafted showing Chris, {{directly}} after hearing Lois' prison term, flashbacking {{back to him}} watching Six Feet Under, seeing a same-sex couple kissing, and exclaiming [...] "Oh, come on!" [...] The song based around Glen Quagmire was sung and recorded by professional studio singers who sing at {{events such as the}} Academy Awards. The scene following Peter saying to Lois: [...] "I had to do, well you know, that thing that you usually do for me every Thursday night" [...] showing Peter attempting to give himself fellatio, hitting his head on the wall and falling down the stairs was repeatedly fought by broadcasting standards, but they eventually allowed the scene. In the original episode draft, Peter was to be seen falling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> Stewie's foot was to be lodged inside Peter's anus, where he was to lose his shoe. Peter breaks the fourth wall and begins to speak with viewers during his interview with the sumo wrestling employee; Executive Producer David A. Goodman comments in the episode DVD commentary that this is [...] "one of the few times, maybe the only time, when [...] can step out of format and point out the format." [...] The [...] "CBS Asiantown" [...] logo shown on the Griffins' television was prohibited from broadcast on the televised version of the episode.|$|E
60|$|He {{could not}} have done {{anything}} worse, except run away, for a bear's mouth is tough.

6000|$|So {{saying the}} bold man dashed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>and</b> into <b>the</b> next house, {{followed}} by the town-guards, {{who did not know}} him. The prisoners' guards were fortunately searching in another direction. A strict search was made in the next house, at which Quentin assisted. When they were yet in the thick of it he went quietly down-stairs and walked away from the scene, as he expressed it, [...] "hotchin'"--by which he meant chuckling.|$|R

500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E

[...] The reverse of the sign reads [...] "Do you need any cleaning products today?" [...] Gerald heads inside and hides Sabrina's body as Paul waits. Gerald splashes his soup onto the blood and invites Paul to clean it. Ray runs <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> meets Paul; he proceeds to buy rope before returning upstairs. Paul continues to clean, but sees the bullethole in the cushion, and then the suitcase being lowered outside the window. Gerald heads outside to investigate, but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The burglars run past Paul and look out to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul. Paul rings someone and says [...] "Hello, it's me. Yeah, it's done." [...] He looks to the fake painting, and says [...] "I've got it right here. Yeah, it's fine. Not a peep out of anyone." [...] He takes down the painting and walks out, as the real canvas is seen sinking in the pool.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2013, the {{paternity}} of Summer (now 18 years old) is questioned {{upon the}} revelation that Nick declared himself her father despite the initial paternity test being corrupt.

Camryn Grimes (who is playing the Cassie lookalike) stated that Victor and Fake Cassie's [...] "initial plan" [...] was to make Nick believe Sharon was [...] "nuts and seeing ghosts" [...] so that he would not reunite with her. However, [...] "then they find out Sharon has an explosive secret â€” one Victor can really use", that being the secret of Summer's paternity, which Sharon no longer recalls due to recent ECT treatment having resulted in memory loss.|$|E
