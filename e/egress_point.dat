30|$|The above {{mentioned}} issues are typically addressed {{using a variety}} of NAT traversal protocols. NAT traversal is a generic term used to identify techniques that establish and maintain TCP and/or UDP connections across NAT gateways. The general goal of a client implementing a NAT traversal protocol is to know its own external address (i.e., the address behind which the local address space has be hidden). The client can then start the communication by advertising its external NAT address to its peers, rather than the masqueraded (local) address that is not reachable for its peers on the public network. However, NAT traversal techniques are not designed to handle dynamic network <b>egress</b> <b>points,</b> as a matter of fact, a client has no way of notifying its peers that its external address has changed. Possible solutions involve modifying currently used NAT traversal protocols (e.g., Session Traversal Utilities for NAT [19]) in order to support dynamic network <b>egress</b> <b>points</b> or implementing a Mobile IP architecture in order to allow end-users' client to roam across different public networks. Both approaches are highly invasive and as such are out of the scope of this work.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Interdomain route {{changes are}} {{frequent}} {{and they can}} have negative impact on a network’s operation: during route convergence, packets get delayed and dropped; after route convergence, changes in the <b>egress</b> <b>point</b> for reaching a destination can alter the network’s intradomain traffic patterns and trigger new traffic-engineering. In this paper, we look into reducing the impact of interdomain route changes on the network’s operation. First, we investigate a route decision process which avoids the selection of routes that cause <b>egress</b> <b>point</b> changes. However, this decision process does not consider the potential benefit of selecting a more preferred route even if it causes an <b>egress</b> <b>point</b> change. Then, we propose a system which only avoids route changes causing recurring intradomain traffic shifts by processing the route changes history and by selectively modifying route attributes which affect the route decision process. We evaluate both approaches using data from a major European ISP. The modified route decision process avoids 89 % of the observed intradomain traffic shifts caused by interdomain route changes, whereas route attribute modifications {{reduce the number of}} traffic shifts on average by 25 %, and as much as 50 %. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In a large {{backbone}} network, the routers often have multiple egress points {{they could use}} to direct traffic toward an external destination.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we perform a {{detailed}} analysis of point-to-point packet delay in an operational tier- 1 network. The point-to-point delay is the time between a packet entering a router in one PoP (an ingress point) and its leaving a router in another PoP (an <b>egress</b> <b>point).</b> It measures the one-way delay experienced by packets from an ingress point to an <b>egress</b> <b>point</b> across an ISP's network and provides the most basic information regarding the delay performance of the ISP's network. Using packet traces captured in the operational network, we obtain precise point-to-point packet delay measurements and analyze the various factors affecting them. Through a simple, stepby -step, systematic methodology and careful data analysis, we identify the major network factors that contribute to point-topoint packet delay and characterize their effect on the network delay performance. Our findings are: 1) delay distributions vary greatly in shape, depending on the path and link utilization; 2) after constant factors dependent only on the path and packet size are removed, the 99 th percentile variable delay remains under 1 ms over several hops and under link utilization below 90 % on a bottleneck; 3) {{a very small number of}} packets experience very large delay in short bursts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Inter-AS {{outbound}} traffic engineering (TE) {{is a set}} of techniques for controlling inter-AS traffic exiting an autonomous system (AS) by assigning the traffic to the best <b>egress</b> <b>points</b> (i. e. routers or links) from which the traffic is for-warded to adjacent ASes towards the destinations. In practice, changing network conditions such as inter-AS traffic demand variation, link failures and inter-AS routing changes occur dynamically. These changes can make fixed outbound TE solutions inadequate and may subsequently cause inter-AS links to become con-gested. In order to overcome this problem, we propose the deployment of a closed-loop control traffic engineering system that makes {{outbound traffic}} robust to inter-AS link failures and adaptive to changing network conditions. The objective is to keep the inter-AS link utilization balanced under unexpected events while reducing ser-vice disruptions and reconfiguration overheads. Our evaluation results show that the proposed system can successfully achieve better load balancing with less service disruption and re-configuration overhead in comparison to alternative approaches...|$|R

On the whole, standing passengers who remain on board have priority to get a seat over those who will board, but some passengers may prefer to remain standing when their egress station is close.
