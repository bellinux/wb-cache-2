[...] "I could have wept with rage... I showed him the corpses all around him; they too had wanted to rest here... <b>I</b> <b>yelled</b> against the wind...I felt I was not arguing with him, but with death itself, with the death he had already chosen."

500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause {{followed by a}} wry smile at the umpire {{before returning to the}} mound. Galarraga told reporters after the game that the outing [...] "was my best game, so far", and said that Joyce [...] "probably feels more bad than me. Nobody's perfect. Everybody's human. I understand. I give the guy {{a lot of credit for}} saying, 'I need to talk to you.' You don't see an umpire tell you that after a game. I gave him a hug." [...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. I said before, I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to tell my son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. <b>I</b> <b>yelled</b> a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it." [...] Leyland also said that Joyce's call was part of the [...] "human element of the game".|$|E
2500|$|It was a {{freezing}} {{night at}} VFL Park in Melbourne {{and they had}} just introduced the stump microphone. Rainy, miserable night it was. Ray Bright was our 12th man and I spent several overs {{trying to get his}} attention. In the end <b>I</b> <b>yelled</b> into the stump mic, 'Hey Brighty, where's me f—ing jumper?' I thought they'd cut it out, but apparently it went to air. Packer wasn't impressed. Got hauled over the coals for that one! ...|$|E

2500|$|Just {{before the}} derailment, {{witnesses}} recalled observing the train {{passing through the}} crossing at an excessive speed with no locomotive lights, [...] "infernal" [...] noise and sparks being emitted from the wheels. Gilles Fluet, a Musi-Café patron who was leaving the site just before the derailment, said the wheels were smoking lots of white smoke. The runaway train passed [...] behind him moving at highway speed. Travelling with no signals, the train jumped the track, sending a river of burning oil into the lake. [...] "It was moving at a hellish speed ... no lights, no signals, nothing at all. There was no warning. It was a black blob {{that came out of}} nowhere. I realized they were oil tankers {{and they were going to}} blow up, so <b>I</b> <b>yelled</b> that to my friends and I got out of there. If we had stayed where we were, we would have been roasted." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} {{was not without}} its lucky accidents: The company had just finished shooting the final segment of the sequence where Phyllis and Walter make their getaway after dumping their victim's body on the tracks. The crew was breaking for lunch before striking the set. In the script, the pair get in their car and simply drive away. But as Wilder got into his own car to leave, it wouldn't start. Inspired, he ran back and ordered the crew back. Wilder reshot the scene, only this time as Phyllis starts the car, the motor stalls and won't turn over. She tries several more times, but the car won't start and the two {{look at each other}} in growing panic. Walter desperately reaches over, turns the key and guns the motor, finally starting the car. Only then do they speed away from the crime scene. The result {{was one of the most}} suspenseful scenes in the film, but was not in the original script. MacMurray was surprised when he first saw it onscreen: [...] "...When I... turned the key I remember I was doing it fast and Billy kept saying, 'Make it longer, make it longer,' and finally <b>I</b> <b>yelled,</b> 'For Chrissake Billy, it's not going to hold that long,' and he said, 'Make it longer,' and he was right." ...|$|E
