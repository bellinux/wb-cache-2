40|$|Hydropower {{and nuclear}} power are the most {{important}} sources of energy in Sweden. Half of Sweden’s total energy production is produced in the hydropower plants along the Swedish rivers. The size of the hydropower units in these power plants varies. The biggest hydropower unit in Sweden, Harsprånget G 5, has a rotating structure that weighs over 1000 ton and generates almost 500 MW. Hydropower units use the kinetic energy of the falling water and transform it to electrical energy. In a hydropower unit as big as the G 5, approximately 500 m 3 water passes through the turbine each second. The enormous flow of water through the turbine and the enormous mass of the rotating structure results in huge loads on the bearings that supports the rotating structure. The characteristics of generator bearings and the loads acting on it has been analysed in this thesis. A method to determine bearing data from measured loads and displacements in the generator bearing has been developed and evaluated. The loads are measured with a method that allows bearing loads to be measured without disassemble the bearing. Disturbances that affect these measurements has also been analysed. MATLAB were used for mathematical computation and analysis. Data measured at the hydropower units were analysed and some disturbances were found. Most of the measured data were affected by 50 and 100 Hz disturbances. To avoid the influence of these disturbances appropriate filters should be used. Some strange frequency characteristics were also found in the measurements performed with the <b>inductive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>sensors.</b> The huge magnetic field that surrounds the hydropower unit probably affects the <b>inductive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>sensors.</b> <b>Inductive</b> <b>displacements</b> <b>sensor</b> should therefore be avoided in displacement measurements near generators at hydropower units. It is possible to calculate the bearing data for the generator bearing if the displacements and loads in the generator bearing are measured correctly. The bearing data for the generator bearing is calculated in the generator axles static position. The static position of the generator axle depends of the load cases that affect the hydropower unit.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the limitations of}} <b>inductive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>sensors</b> (IDSs) was conducted with the use of electromagnetic finite element analysis (FEA). A comparison of displacement sensing technologies highlighted the advantages of EDSs in harsh industrial environments, but an understanding of the operation of IDSs showed that they are limited by the influence of target material, width and offset. It was proposed that studying the electromagnetic field around IDSs could reveal more information than was available from the simple impedance measurements employed by a commercially available IDS. A test coil sensor and signal processing system was designed and the result was a reliable system for measuring the magnetic field around the IDS. Experiments showed that the 1 MHz field had an amplitude of 5 x 10 (^- 6) T {{at the base of the}} IDS and two- and three-dimensional FEA models were constructed that gave closely matching central field values. The unreliability of the IDS for different target materials was demonstrated experimentally. FEA simulations showed that changing target permeability and varying target displacement both altered the whole field amplitude uniformly. This showed that it was not possible to counteract the target dependence by monitoring the field with the test coil system in this way. Further FEA simulations revealed field patterns that changed with target offset. An experiment with the test coil system confirmed that it was possible to use the change in lobe amplitude to measure the offset of the target; for example when target displacement d, = 25 mm and offset = 1. 2 times the IDS coil diameter, the distance error was 3. 6 %, which corresponded to a normalised test coil output of 0. 54. A similar effect was found from target width FEA simulations. Hence it was possible to correct the output signal from the IDS coil to counteract the effect of an offset small target...|$|R

40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearing (AMB) systems support rotating shafts without any physical contact, using electromagnetic forces. Each radial AMB uses {{two pairs of}} electromagnets at {{opposite sides of the}} rotor. This allows the rotor to float in the air gap, and the machine to operate without frictional losses. In active magnetic suspension, displacement sensors are necessary to detect the radial and axial movement of the suspended object. In a high-speed rotating machine equipped with an AMB, the rotor bending modes may be limited to the operating range. The natural frequencies of the rotor can cause instability. Thus, notch filters are a useful circuit for stabilizing the system. In addition, commercial displacement sensors are sometimes not suitable for AMB design, and cannot filter the noise caused by the natural frequencies of rotor. Hence, implementing displacement sensors based on the AMB structure is necessary to eliminate noises caused by natural frequency disturbances. The displacement sensor must be highly sensitive in the desired working range, and also exhibit a low interference noise, high stability, and low cost. In this study, we used the differential inductive sensor head and lock-in amplifier for synchronous demodulation. In addition, an active low-pass filter and a notch filter were used to eliminate disturbances, which caused by natural frequencies. As a consequence, the <b>inductive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>sensor</b> achieved satisfactory linearity, high sensitivity, and disturbance elimination. This sensor can be easily produced for AMB applications. A prototype of these displacement sensors was built and tested...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the dynamic behaviour of a milling process {{is very important for}} finding an optimum process window. In today's manufacturing industry the machining parameters are often predicted using experimental data from non-rotating spindles. Many times the predicted machining parameters prove to be ineffective and inaccurate which lead to reduced quality of the machined surface, tool wear, noise or at worst spindle failure. The best way to study the dynamics of the milling spindle is of course to measure the spindle response under actual operating conditions. Laser vibrometry is a non-contact, non-disturbing method commonly used for measurements of vibrations on static objects. The technique offers the possibility to measure vibrations on thin-walled (light), and rotating objects as well as sound fields. However, two major problems occur when measuring on rotating spindles: (1) speckle noise and (2) crosstalk between the vibration components. These two drawbacks make vibration measurements on rotating spindles difficult to interpret. In this Licentiate thesis the principles of laser vibrometry is introduced and the speckle noise and the crosstalk between the velocity components of a rotating spindle is studied experimentally. The rotating spindle is excited by an adaptive magnetic bearing and the response is measured by laser vibrometry and non-contact <b>inductive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>sensors</b> simultaneously. The work shows that by polishing the measurement surface optically smooth we are able to avoid the speckle noise and the crosstalk problem. By using this approach, the vibrations as well as the roundness of the measured target can be resolved. Hence, the laser vibrometry technique can be used for measuring the spindle dynamics under operating conditions. Measurements on a bowed violin are performed. The chain of interacting parts of the played violin is studied: the string, the bridge and the plates as well as the generated sound field. The string is excited using a rotating bow apparatus and the vibrations from the string transmits to the violin body via the bridge and produces the sound. The measurements on the string shows stick-slip behaviour and the bridge measurements show that the string vibrations transmit to the bridge both in the horizontal and the vertical direction. Measurements on the plates show complex deflection shapes which are a combination of different eigenmodes. The sound fields emitted from the violin were measured and visualized for different harmonic partials of the played tone. However, the visualized sound field obtained by the laser vibrometer is a projection of the sound field along the laser light and the image obtained is a 2 D map of the real 3 D sound field. This effect is illustrated by measurements of a sound field emitted from three ultrasound transducers. Godkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|R

In static conditions, the resolution is about 0. 01 % of the full scale of the considered sensor, which is on the same order as the one obtained with spectral estimation.

40|$|International audienceElectrical contact {{crimping}} is {{a process}} commonly used in aeronautical and aero spatial applications. One require-ment to perform a resistant assembly is to master crimping parameters. Numerical simulation is then an efficient tool to limit tedious experimental test campaigns. Nevertheless, the numerical model accuracy depends on input data determina-tion, such as material behaviour law parameters. This paper deals with study done to determine material behaviour law parameters of component involved on electri-cal crimping process. The two samples, a strand and an electrical contact, have both small dimensions and specific shapes. For that reason, normalised tensile or compression tests could not be perform. Indeed, inverse analysis is a powerful tool to determine the behaviour laws parameters. The goal is to precisely model the sample mechanical solicitation. A series of computations is launched with various rheological parameters. By comparing experimental and simulated results, {{the goal is to}} minimize a cost function. Thus, the first step of the study has been to determine experimental tests to perform in order to gather the force/displacement experimental data. The copper strands have been studied in compression, with a micro indentation de-vice. A 60 N force sensor has been used to acquire force data, whereas an <b>inductive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>sensor</b> has been used for displacement acquisition data. The 60 N force sensor is too weak to crush completely a copper contact. For that sample, we decided to use an instrumented crimping plier. A series of crimping tests has been performed on empty barrel, and the equivalent simulation has been done. With the best copper strand material parameters set, relative errors between experimental and simulated copper strand data finally amount to 6. 9 % (lower than the 8 % experimental data scattering). On the other side, with the best cop-per contact material parameters set, the cost function amounts to 4 % (lower than the 7 % experimental data scattering). This study allows to determine material parameters sets which are use to simulate efficiently the crimping process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{present the}} data of a mode-I {{fracture}} experiment. The samples are broken under imposed pressure. The acoustic emission of microfractures before {{the breakup of the}} sample is registered. From the acoustic signals, the position of microfractures and the energy released are calculated. A measure of the clustering of microfractures yields information about the critical load. The statistics from energy measurements strongly suggest that the fracture {{can be viewed as a}} critical phenomenon; energy events are distributed in magnitude as a power law, and a critical exponent is found for the energy near fracture. [S 0031 - 9007 (97) 04346 - 9] PACS numbers: 62. 20. Mk, 46. 30. Nz Fracture is a problem which has recently received a lot of attention in the physics community [1 – 3]. It is troublesome to calculate the force needed to break a heterogeneous material. Instead, it is customary to resort to tests involving the destruction of the sample. Therefore it is interesting to provide additional knowledge about cracks by studying the events that occur prior to the fracture. Besides, despite great experimental and numerical efforts [1 – 6], many aspects still remain unclear about the fracture process itself. Conceptually simple models, such as per-colation [6] and self-organized criticality [7], are attractive but often fail to convey the complex phenomenology observed. The main motivation of this work is to understand if these models can reproduce the main features of crack formation. We report here some experimental results that may help to gain valuable information in that direction. Our main tool is the monitoring of the microfractures, which occur before the final breakup, by recording their acoustic emissions (AE). Because of its ability to pinpoint the emission source, this technique has been widely used in seismography and to map the nucleation of fractures [8]. From these signals, we have also obtained the acoustic energy of each microfracture, which is a fraction of the total energy released. The behavior of the energy just before fracture is a good parameter to compare with the above mentioned models. In order to avoid noise, we have designed a setup in which there are no moving parts, the force being exerted by pressurized air (see Fig. 1). A circular sample having a diameter of 22 cm and a thickness of 5 mm is placed between two chambers between which a pressure difference P ෇ P 2 2 P 1 is imposed. The deformation of the plate at the center is bigger than its thickness, then the load is mainly radial [9, 10]. Therefore, the experience can be thought of as a mode-I test with circular symmetry. The pressure difference P supported by the sample is slowly increased and it is monitored by a differential transducer. This measure has a stability of 0. 002 atm. The fracture pressure for the different tested materials ranges from 0. 7 to 2 atm. We regulate P by means of a feedback loop and an electronically controlled valve which connects one of the two chambers to a pressurized air reservoir. The time taken to correct pressure variations (about 0. 1 s) is smaller than the characteristic time of the strain rate. An <b>inductive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>sensor</b> gives the deformation at the center of the plate with a precision of about 10 mm (the deformation just before fracture is of the order of 1 cm). The apparatus is placed inside a copper box covered with a thick foam layer to avoid both electrical and acoustical noise. Four wide-band piezoelectric microphones are placed on the side of the sample (see Fig. 1). The signal is amplified, low-pass filtered at 70 kHz, and sent to a digitizing oscilloscope and to an electronic device which measures the acoustic energy detected by the microphones. The signal captured by the oscilloscope is sent to a computer where a program automatically detects the arrival time of the AE at each microphone. Afterwards, a calculation yields the position of the source inside the sample. A fraction of the detected events is rejected, either as a result of a large uncertainty of the location, or because they are regarded as noise. The mean standard error for the calculated positions is about 6 mm, which results mainly from the uncertainty of the arrival time. The electronic device that measures the energy performs the square of the AE amplitude and then integrates it over a time window of 30 ms, which is the maximum duration of one acoustic event. The output signal is proportional to the energy of the events [11], an...|$|E

It is shown that compared to previously published <b>displacement</b> <b>sensors,</b> based on SRR-loaded coplanar waveguides, the proposed one-dimensional sensor benefits from a much wider dynamic range. Secondly, it is shown that with modifications in the geometry of the BC-SRRs, the proposed one-dimensional sensor can be modified and extended by adding a second element to create a high-dynamic range two-dimensional <b>displacement</b> <b>sensor.</b> Since the proposed sensors operate based on a split in the resonance frequency, rather than the resonance depth, they benefit from a high immunity to environmental noise. Furthermore, since the sensors’ principle of operation {{is based on the}} deviation from symmetry, they are more robust to ambient conditions such as changes in the temperature, and thus they can be used as alignment sensors as well. A prototype of the proposed two-dimensional sensor is fabricated and the concept and simulation results are validated through experiment...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop an {{intelligent}} McKibben actuator with an integrated soft <b>displacement</b> <b>sensor</b> inside, so that displacement of this actuator can be controlled without having any extra devices attached. In addition, the high compliance which is a positive feature of the McKibben actuator is still conserved. This paper consists of four main parts. First of all, different types of soft <b>displacement</b> <b>sensors</b> made out of rubber were composed, and tested for their functional characteristics. Secondly, the intelligent McKibben actuator was developed with the soft <b>displacement</b> <b>sensor</b> incorporated within. Then, experiments of the position servo control with a single intelligent McKibben actuator were carried out. At last a robot arm mechanism was designed with two intelligent McKibben actuators, and those experimental results showed a great potential for its future applications. </p...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a program}} to develop gauges for {{measurement}} of various mechanical properties in hostile environments, the authors fielded purely optical <b>displacement</b> <b>sensors</b> {{at the ends of}} long fiber-optic cables as supplements to the regular <b>displacement</b> <b>sensors</b> of four impulse gauges fielded as {{part of a}} materials study on the Hunters Trophy underground effects test at the Nevada Test Site. These fiber-optic sensor systems and their performance on the Hunters Trophy test are described in this report...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} cutting force {{monitoring}} for high-precision machining. The authors have employed <b>displacement</b> <b>sensors</b> {{to monitor the}} cutting forces, as they are cheap and small enough {{to be built in}} the spindle structure. A monitoring method, which utilizes sensitive <b>displacement</b> <b>sensors,</b> is discussed. The sensors are installed in XY directions near the front bearings of the spindle to detect the small displacements of a spindle caused by cutting forces. Monitoring tests are carried out under end-milling operations and the cutting forces are estimated from the displacement signals by the simple signal processing technique. However, as the <b>displacement</b> <b>sensor</b> measures the variation of the gap size between the sensor head and the target surface, it also records displacements due to error motion of a spindle's axis of rotation in radial direction and roundness errors of the target surface. By comparing the cutting force estimated from <b>displacement</b> <b>sensors</b> with the cutting force measured by using a dynamometer, the machine tool spindle error motions are investigated, and its compensation scheme is proposed. The test results show that the monitoring system is reliable for the adaptive control of machining accuracy for end-milling process...|$|R
