5|$|Isospora anthochaerae is an Apicomplexan {{parasite}} {{that has}} been isolated from the red wattlebird in Western Australia, from oocytes collected from <b>faecal</b> samples. Species of bird louse that have been recorded on the red wattlebird include Menacanthus eurysternus {{and members of the}} genera Brueelia, Myrsidea and Philopterus.|$|E
5|$|A white {{cockatoo}} and a sulphur-crested cockatoo {{were found to}} be infected with the protozoon Haemoproteus and another sulphur-crested cockatoo had the malaria parasite Plasmodium on analysis of <b>faecal</b> samples at Almuñecar ornithological garden in Granada in Spain. Like amazon parrots and macaws, cockatoos frequently develop cloacal papillomas. The relationship with malignancy is unknown, as is the cause, although a parrot papilloma virus has been isolated from an African grey parrot with the condition.|$|E
5|$|Anteaters, aardvarks, pangolins, {{echidnas}} and numbats {{have special}} adaptations for {{living on a}} diet of ants. These adaptations include long, sticky tongues to capture ants and strong claws to break into ant nests. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) {{have been found to}} feed on ants. About 12%, 16%, and 4% of their <b>faecal</b> volume in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively, is composed of ants.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are {{extremely}} harmful to fur-bearing rodents, such as coypu and muskrats. Coypu can be completely extirpated {{in shallow water}} bodies. During 1948–1949 in the Amu Darya, muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal <b>faecal</b> contents, and 71% of muskrat houses were destroyed by jackals. Jackals also harm the fur industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry.|$|E
5|$|A decade-long {{study of}} urine and <b>faecal</b> samples at the Gunung Palung Orangutan Conservation Project in West Kalimantan {{has shown that}} orangutans give birth {{during and after the}} high fruit season (though not every year), during which they consume various {{abundant}} fruits, totalling up to 11,000 calories per day. In the low-fruit season, they eat whatever fruit is available in addition to tree bark and leaves, with daily intake at only 2,000 calories. Together with a long lactation period, orangutans also have a long birth interval.|$|E
5|$|Chicks hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they {{are covered in}} whitish down. Chicks defecate outside of the nest by raising their tail {{to the side of}} the nest, so nests with older chicks are {{surrounded}} by <b>faecal</b> matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over brooding duties while the other leaves to hunt.|$|E
5|$|Female {{elephants}} {{spend their}} entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, {{some of which are}} made up of more than ten members, including three pairs of mothers with offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of <b>faecal</b> corticosterone ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present. The older matriarchs tend to be more effective decision-makers.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} generalist predators, eating microalgae, sponges, bivalves, snails {{and other small}} animals. The crown-of-thorns starfish consumes coral polyps, while other species are detritivores, feeding on decomposing organic {{material}} and <b>faecal</b> matter. A few are suspension feeders, gathering in phytoplankton; Henricia and Echinaster often occur in association with sponges, benefiting from the water current they produce. Various species {{have been shown to}} be able to absorb organic nutrients from the surrounding water, and this may form a significant portion of their diet.|$|E
5|$|The female incubates for 12–14 {{days before}} the altricial chicks are hatched naked and blind. Fledging takes another 10–19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and {{removing}} <b>faecal</b> sacs. The nest is often ill-concealed {{compared with those of}} other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed by the parents for up to three weeks after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults begging for food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone will feed the fledged young. Second broods are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may be raised in the south of the common blackbird's range.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{unambiguous}} termite fossils date to {{the early}} Cretaceous, but given the diversity of Cretaceous termites and early fossil records showing mutualism between microorganisms and these insects, they likely originated earlier in the Jurassic or Triassic. Further evidence of a Jurassic origin {{is the assumption that}} the extinct Fruitafossor consumed termites, judging from its morphological similarity to modern termite-eating mammals. The oldest termite nest discovered is believed to be from the Upper Cretaceous in West Texas, where the oldest known <b>faecal</b> pellets were also discovered.|$|E
5|$|Incubation {{has been}} {{recorded}} as averaging around 17 days. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial; they are born blind and naked, and start to develop down on their heads on day two. Their eyes open around day six, and they begin developing their primary flight feathers around day nine or ten. For {{the first three days}} after hatching, the mother feeds the nestlings alone, with food brought to her by the father. The father feeds them directly from the fourth day onwards, with the mother brooding them afterwards until day seven. Flies, butterflies, moths, caterpillars and beetles predominate in the food fed to the young birds. Flame robins fed a higher proportion of flying insects to their young at Nimmitabel than did scarlet robins, which may have been due to their later start to breeding. Both parents participate in removing <b>faecal</b> sacs from the nest. Parents have been observed feeding young up to five weeks after leaving the nest.|$|E
5|$|The typical clutch size is two eggs, 20.3 × 15.1mm in size, {{which are}} pale blueish green with red or brown splotches that are {{concentrated}} around the wider end. Both sexes share the incubation duties, with each parent incubating for stints of around 25minutes before being relieved. This species is extremely territorial around the nest, chasing away other birds, including brindled white-eyes, rufous fantails, and other golden white-eyes. From laying {{it takes about}} two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The hatchlings are altricial, in other words naked and helpless. Both parents share the brooding and feeding duties, and take away <b>faecal</b> sacs to keep the nest clean. The diet of the chicks is almost exclusively composed of insects and caterpillars. Chicks fledge around 1014 days after hatching. After fledging they may remain with their parents in small groups for some time.|$|E
5|$|To {{build their}} nests, {{termites}} primarily use faeces, which have many desirable properties as a construction material. Other building materials include partly digested plant material, used in carton nests (arboreal nests built from <b>faecal</b> elements and wood), and soil, used in subterranean nest and mound construction. Not all nests are visible, as many nests in tropical forests are located underground. Species in the subfamily Apicotermitinae are {{good examples of}} subterranean nest builders, as they only dwell inside tunnels. Other termites live in wood, and tunnels are constructed as they feed on the wood. Nests and mounds protect the termites' soft bodies against desiccation, light, pathogens and parasites, {{as well as providing}} a fortification against predators. Nests made out of carton are particularly weak, and so the inhabitants use counter-attack strategies against invading predators.|$|E
5|$|Activation of AMPK was {{required}} for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that {{plays an important role}} in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK Activation {{was required}} for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. Mouse models in which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes, have raised doubts over the role of AMPK, since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate). Increased cellular AMP has been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the <b>faecal</b> microbial community profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.|$|E
5|$|Almost all antbirds lay two eggs. A few {{species of}} antshrike lay three eggs, {{and a smaller}} number of antbirds lay one egg, but this is unusual. Small clutch sizes are typical of {{tropical}} birds compared to more temperate species of the same size, possibly due to nest predation, although this is disputed. Both parents participate in incubation, although only the female incubates at night. The length of time taken for chicks to hatch is 14–16 days in most species, although some, such as the dusky antbird, can take as long as 20 days. The altricial chicks are born naked and blind. Both parents brood the young until they are able to thermoregulate, although, as with incubation, only the female broods at night. In common with many songbirds, the parents take <b>faecal</b> sacs for disposal away from the nest. Both parents feed the chicks, often bringing large prey items. When the chicks reach fledging age, after 8–15 days, attending parents call their chicks. As each chick leaves the nest it is cared for exclusively from then on by the parent that was present then. After the first chick fledges and leaves with a parent the remaining parent may increase the supply of food to speed up the process of fledging. After fledging, chicks spend the first few days well hidden as the parents bring them food. Chicks of some species may not become independent of the parents for as long as four months in some antwrens, but two months is more typical {{for the rest of the}} family.|$|E
5|$|Incubation lasts {{thirteen}} days, {{although the}} last egg laid may take 24hours {{longer than the}} first to hatch. Both parents share the responsibility of brooding the eggs, but the female spends more time incubating them than does the male, {{and is the only}} parent to do so at night when the male returns to the communal roost. The young are born blind and naked. They develop light fluffy down within seven days of hatching and can see within nine days. Once the chicks are able to regulate their body temperature, about six days after hatching, the adults largely cease removing droppings from the nest. Prior to that, the fouling would wet both the chicks' plumage and the nest material, thereby reducing their effectiveness as insulation and increasing the risk of chilling the hatchlings. Nestlings remain in the nest for three weeks, where they are fed continuously by both parents. Fledglings continue to be fed by their parents for another one or two weeks. A pair can raise up to three broods per year, frequently reusing and relining the same nest, although two broods is typical, or just one north of 48°N. Within two months, most juveniles will have moulted and gained their first basic plumage. They acquire their adult plumage the following year. As with other passerines, the nest is kept clean and the chicks' <b>faecal</b> sacs are removed by the adults.|$|E
5|$|Most {{termites}} are blind, so communication primarily occurs through chemical, {{mechanical and}} pheromonal cues. These {{methods of communication}} are used {{in a variety of}} activities, including foraging, locating reproductives, construction of nests, recognition of nestmates, nuptial flight, locating and fighting enemies, and defending the nests. The most common way of communicating is through antennation. A number of pheromones are known, including contact pheromones (which are transmitted when workers are engaged in trophallaxis or grooming) and alarm, trail and sex pheromones. The alarm pheromone and other defensive chemicals are secreted from the frontal gland. Trail pheromones are secreted from the sternal gland, and sex pheromones derive from two glandular sources: the sternal and tergal glands. When termites go out to look for food, they forage in columns along the ground through vegetation. A trail can be identified by the <b>faecal</b> deposits or runways that are covered by objects. Workers leave pheromones on these trails, which are detected by other nestmates through olfactory receptors. Termites can also communicate through mechanical cues, vibrations, and physical contact. These signals are frequently used for alarm communication or for evaluating a food source.|$|E
25|$|Drinking {{water quality}} is not {{consistently}} good, especially in smaller systems. Portugal does {{not comply with}} a series of drinking water parameters (iron, manganese, total coliforms, <b>faecal</b> coliforms, <b>faecal</b> streptococci and clostridium) laid down in the EU drinking water directive. For example, almost 50% of water supply zones do not comply as regards total coliforms, while 20% of the zones do not comply with the <b>faecal</b> coliforms parameter.|$|E
25|$|Another {{measure of}} human <b>faecal</b> {{contamination}} is {{the proportion of}} the two 3β-ol isomers in the 5β form. 5α-cholestanol is formed naturally in the environment by bacteria and generally does not have a <b>faecal</b> origin. Samples with ratios greater than 0.7 may be contaminated with human <b>faecal</b> matter; samples with values less than 0.3 may be considered uncontaminated. Samples with ratios between these two cut-offs can not readily be categorised {{on the basis of this}} ratio alone.|$|E
25|$|Since 5β-coprostanol {{is formed}} from {{cholesterol}} in the vertebrate gut, {{the ratio of}} the product over reactant can be used to indicate the degree of <b>faecal</b> matter in samples. Raw untreated sewage typically has a 5β-coprostanol / cholesterol ratio of ~10 which decreases through a sewage treatment plant (STP) such that in the discharged liquid wastewaters the ratio is ~2. Undiluted STP wastewaters may be identified by this high ratio. As the <b>faecal</b> matter is dispersed in the environment, the ratio will decrease as more (non-faecal) cholesterol from animals is encountered. Grimalt & Albaiges have suggested that samples with a 5β-coprostanol / cholesterol greater than 0.2 may be considered as contaminated by <b>faecal</b> material.|$|E
25|$|Spreading {{wastewater}} or {{sewage sludge}} in agriculture {{may also be}} included as sources of <b>faecal</b> contamination in groundwater.|$|E
25|$|More {{accurately}} {{estimate the}} total population of wild bongos through <b>faecal</b> DNA analysis, camera trapping, and transect surveying.|$|E
25|$|Smell from {{flatulence}} {{is commonly}} treated with bismuth subgallate, available over-the-counter in the US as Devrom. Bismuth subgallate {{is commonly used}} by individuals who have had ostomy surgery, bariatric surgery, <b>faecal</b> incontinence and irritable bowel syndrome. Bismuth subsalicylate {{is a compound that}} binds H2S, and one study reported a dose of 524mg four times a day for 3–7 days bismuth subsalicylate yielded a >95% reduction in <b>faecal</b> H2S release in both humans and rats.|$|E
25|$|Flatus {{incontinence}} {{where there}} is involuntary passage of gas, {{is a type of}} <b>faecal</b> incontinence, and is managed similarly.|$|E
25|$|Through <b>faecal</b> DNA analysis, {{estimate}} the genetic {{diversity of the}} remaining wild bongos and calculate the relatedness of the isolated wild populations.|$|E
25|$|In dense colonies, {{there is}} much faeces, however the {{majority}} of <b>faecal</b> contamination is on the pointed end of the egg, therefore the blunt end is cleaner where the chick emerges.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{source of}} 5β-coprostanol {{in the environment}} is from human wastes. The concentration of 5β-coprostanol in raw, untreated sewage is around 2-6% of the dry solids. This relatively high concentration and its stability allows it {{to be used in}} the assessment of the <b>faecal</b> matter in samples, especially sediments.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{drinking}} water, Portugal {{still does}} not comply {{with some of the}} parameters of the EU directive. For example, almost 50% of water supply zones do not comply as regards total coliforms, while 20% of the zones do not comply with the <b>faecal</b> coliforms parameter. The situation improved in 2004, the most recent year for which Portugal provided data.|$|E
25|$|During sewage treatment, 5β-coprostanol may be {{converted}} to 5β-cholestan-3α-ol form, epi-coprostanol. There is also a slow conversion of 5β-coprostanol to epi-coprostanol in the environment and so this ratio will indicate either the degree of treatment of sewage or its age in the environment. A cross-plot of the 5β-coprostanol / cholesterol ratio with the epi-coprostanol / 5β-coprostanol can indicate both <b>faecal</b> contamination and treatment.|$|E
25|$|In {{anaerobic}} sediments and soils, 5β-coprostanol {{is stable}} for {{many hundreds of}} years enabling it {{to be used as}} an indicator of past <b>faecal</b> discharges. As such, records of 5β-coprostanol from paleo-environmental archives have been used to further constrain the timing of human settlements in a region, as well as reconstruct relative changes in human populations and agricultural activities over several thousand years.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{conditions}} {{affecting the}} bowels include infectious diarrhoea and mesenteric ischaemia. Causes of constipation may include <b>faecal</b> impaction and bowel obstruction, which may in turn {{be caused by}} ileus, intussusception, volvulus. Inflammatory bowel disease is a condition of unknown aetiology, classified as either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, that can affect the intestines {{and other parts of}} the gastrointestinal tract. Other causes of illness include intestinal pseudoobstruction, and necrotizing enterocolitis.|$|E
25|$|Specific helminths can be {{identified}} through microscopic examination of their eggs (ova) found in <b>faecal</b> samples. The number of eggs is measured in units of eggs per gram. However, it does not quantify mixed infections, and in practice, is inaccurate for quantifying the eggs of schistosomes and soil-transmitted helmiths. Sophisticated tests such as serological assays, antigen tests, and molecular diagnosis are also available; however, they are time-consuming, expensive and not always reliable.|$|E
25|$|Soil-transmitted {{helminthiasis}} (STH) {{is a type}} of helminth infection (helminthiasis) {{caused by}} different species of roundworms. It is caused specifically by those worms which are transmitted through soil contaminated with <b>faecal</b> matter and are therefore called soil-transmitted helminths. Three types of soil-transmitted helminthiasis can be distinguished: ascariasis, hookworm infection and whipworm infection. These three types of infection are therefore caused by the large roundworm A. lumbricoides; the hookworms Necator americanusor Ancyclostoma duodenale; and by the whipworm Trichuris trichiura respectively.|$|E
25|$|Other animals, such as {{rabbits and}} rodents, {{practise}} coprophagia behaviours – eating specialised faeces {{in order to}} re-digest food, {{especially in the case}} of roughage. Capybara, rabbits, hamsters and other related species do not have a complex digestive system as do, for example, ruminants. Instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut. Soft <b>faecal</b> pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately. They also produce normal droppings, which are not eaten.|$|E
25|$|Herbivores such as {{cows and}} sheep consume {{terrestrial}} plant matter (grass) which contains β-sitosterol {{as the principal}} sterol. β-sitosterol is the 24-ethyl derivative of cholesterol {{and can be used}} as a biomarker for terrestrial plant matter (see section). In the gut of these animals, bacteria biohydrogenate the double bond in the 5 position to create 24-ethyl coprostanol and so this compound {{can be used as a}} biomarker for <b>faecal</b> matter from herbivores. Typical values in different source materials can be seen in the table after Gilpin.|$|E
25|$|When the {{hurricane}} hit North Carolina, it flooded hog waste lagoons and released 25 {{million gallons of}} manure into the rivers, which contaminated the water supply and reduced water quality. Ronnie Kennedy, Duplin County director for environmental health, said that of 310 private wells he had tested for contamination since the storm, 9 percent, or three times the average across eastern North Carolina, had <b>faecal</b> coliform bacteria. Normally, tests showing any hint of faeces in drinking water, an indication {{that it can be}} carrying disease-causing pathogens, are cause for immediate action.|$|E
