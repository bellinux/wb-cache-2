5|$|Negative {{impressions}} of drinking {{alcohol in the}} Biden and Finnegan families and in the neighborhood led to Joe Biden becoming a teetotaler. Biden suffered from stuttering through much of his childhood and into his twenties, and overcame it by spending many hours reciting poetry in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like Hitler, Goebbels practiced {{his public}} {{speaking}} skills in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror.</b> Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. He usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, {{but he was}} also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Gutawa voiced a {{character}} in Meraih Mimpi (Chasing Dreams), the Indonesian adaptation of Sing to the Dawn; the voice recording took four months. She later cited it as a good learning experience. The following year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, Love in Perth, in which she played a shy student studying in Perth, Australia. She considered it challenging; for the most difficult part, {{a scene in which}} she had to cry, she practised in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror.</b> In May 2011 she began dating her Love in Perth costar Derby Romero; the couple split up sometime before January 2012.|$|E

5|$|In {{support of}} Kaleidoscope Dream, Miguel {{embarked}} on a short promotional tour in the United States on September 26, 2012. He also promoted the record with television performances on 106 & Park, The Wendy Williams Show, Late Show with David Letterman, and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. He subsequently toured {{in support of the}} album for six months throughout North America and Europe, including concert dates as a supporting act on Trey Songz' Chapter V World Tour during November 2012 to February 2013, and a headlining tour in the UK and Ireland during January 2013. Miguel opened for Alicia Keys on her Set The World On Fire Tour during March and April. Although he did not choreograph his shows, he routinely rehearsed in a dance studio and practiced singing in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror.</b> In concert, he performed dramatic leaps, staggers, and other moves fashioned after Little Richard and James Brown. He started ripping his shirt off during performances after being inspired by Songz' concerts.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of red nail polish {{dripping}} from a bottle. It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot against the floor. She begins to start feeling her body. In the next scene, Range is seen standing in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> with a red lollipop, where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their hands against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group {{in front of the}} cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} tested how {{the presence}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> one-way <b>mirror</b> raises feelings of vulnerability and test anxiety. In Exp I, 37 male undergraduates performed 5 tasks measuring social desirability, personal history, and ethics either in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> one-way <b>mirror</b> or not. Exp II duplicated Exp I, but used 93 undergraduates and also measured anxiety, insecurity, {{and willingness to}} report confidential material. In Exp III, Ss performed puzzle and learning tasks and completed a personal questionnaire aloud in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> one-way <b>mirror.</b> Task performance was not <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> one-way screen. Reasons are discussed for accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis: (1) Tasks were not susceptible to influence; (2) Ss were not volunteers; and (3) nonpublication of nonsignificant findings may result in Type I errors...|$|R

25|$|The rouge test is {{a version}} of the mirror test used with children. Using rouge makeup, an {{experimenter}} surreptitiously places a dot {{on the face of the}} child. The child is then placed in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> and their reactions are monitored; depending on the child's development, distinct categories of responses are demonstrated. This test is widely cited as the primary measure for mirror self-recognition in human children.|$|E
25|$|Stick heights are {{not only}} {{important}} for visual reasons but they also strongly affect the sound quality. To get a uniform and consistent sound, one must play with even stick heights {{on the right and}} left hand. To practice playing with accurate stick heights, set up your drum or pad in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror.</b> Start with a simple exercise and watch to see if your left heights are even with your right. If you have access to a video camera, you can record yourself and watch it later. It is easier to watch your heights and critique your performance when you are not focusing on playing.|$|E

25|$|Heseltine's biographers Michael Crick and Julian Critchley recount how, despite {{not having}} an innate gift for public speaking, {{he became a}} strong orator through much effort, which {{included}} practising his speeches in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror,</b> listening to tape recordings of speeches by television administrator Charles Hill, and taking voice-coaching lessons from a vicar's wife. In the 1970s and 1980s Heseltine's conference speech was often to be {{the highlight of the}} Conservative Party Conference despite his views being well {{to the left of the}} then leader Margaret Thatcher. He was eventually elected to the Library Committee of the Oxford Union for Hilary (Spring) Term 1953. The Oxford Union minutes record after a debate on 12 February 1953 that “Mr Heseltine should guard against artificial mannerisms of voice and calculated flourishes of self-conscious histrionics; this is only worth saying because he has the makings of a first class speaker”.|$|E
25|$|The {{training}} of the boys was rigorous. The regimen of one singing school in Rome (c. 1700) consisted of one hour of singing difficult and awkward pieces, one hour practising trills, one hour practising ornamented passaggi, one hour of singing exercises in their teacher's presence and in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> {{so as to avoid}} unnecessary movement of the body or facial grimaces, and one hour of literary study; all this, moreover, before lunch. After, half-an-hour would be devoted to musical theory, another to writing counterpoint, an hour copying down the same from dictation, and another hour of literary study. During the remainder of the day, the young castrati had to find time to practice their harpsichord playing, and to compose vocal music, either sacred or secular depending on their inclination. This demanding schedule meant that, if sufficiently talented, they were able to make a debut in their mid-teens with a perfect technique and a voice of a flexibility and power no woman or ordinary male singer could match.|$|E

When the first chorus begins, Flo Rida is seen wandering around in a different bedroom. During the second verse, Mauboy then appears inside the bedroom looking at a photo, packing her bags, and singing in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror.</b> During this time, Rida is also seen standing in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> in his bedroom. As the video progresses, Mauboy makes her way towards the car, and Rida then raps his verse on the telephone to her. The video ends showing Mauboy back at the balcony at the bedroom.|$|E

A {{lot of people say}} it sounds like Peaches, because of the delivery, the spooky vocals." [...] According to Furtado, the song is related to how people become [...] "hot on themselves" [...] when dancing in their underwear in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mirror.</b> [...] " [...] truly has a life of its own; it makes you move", she said.|$|E
