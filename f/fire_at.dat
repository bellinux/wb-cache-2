5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} naval gunnery; he regularly had them <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills would be made into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun on the target themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E
5|$|I {{then got}} some Coal {{from one of}} the Pits nearest thereunto, which I {{distilled}} in a Retort in an open <b>Fire.</b> <b>At</b> first there came over only Phlegm, afterwards a black Oil, and then likewise a Spirit arose, which I could noways condense, but it forced my Lute, or broke my Glasses. Once, when it had forced the Lute, coming close thereto, {{in order to try to}} repair it, I observed that the Spirit which issued out caught <b>Fire</b> <b>at</b> the Flame of the Candle, and continued burning with Violence as it issued out, in a Stream, which 1 blew out, and lighted again, alternately, for several times.|$|E

50|$|Barrages of rockets were <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> Beersheba and Ashkelon. Half of {{them were}} intercepted by the Iron Dome. Mortar shells <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> {{farmland}} in the Eshkol Regional Council contained phosphorus, {{which is designed to}} create a more intense fire after detonation. 40 rockets were fired on Sunday. Several structures were damaged and a car caught fire after two rockets were <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> Ashkelon. A three-month-old infant was injured by glass splinters.|$|R

5|$|The British {{squadron}} {{spotted the}} Germans at 05:37 (ship's clocks were set four hours ahead of local time – the engagement commenced shortly after dawn), but the Germans were already {{aware of their}} presence, Prinz Eugens hydrophones having previously detected the sounds of high-speed propellers to their southeast. The British opened <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> 05:52 with Hood engaging Prinz Eugen, the lead ship in the German formation, and the Germans returned <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> 05:55, both ships concentrating on Hood. Prinz Eugen was probably the first ship to score when a shell hit Hoods boat deck, between her funnels, and started a large fire among the ready-use ammunition for the anti-aircraft guns and rockets of the UP mounts.|$|E
5|$|The {{battleship}} {{was under}} <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Wonsan 27 May– 29 May, but her five-inch (127mm) guns silenced the counter-fire, and her 16-inch shells destroyed five gun emplacements and four gun caves. She also hit a target that flamed spectacularly: either a {{fuel storage area}} or an ammunition dump.|$|E
50|$|The M60 {{is often}} used with its own {{integrated}} bipod or with the M122 tripod. The M60 is considered effective up to 1,100 meters when <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> an area target and mounted on a tripod; up to 800 meters when <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> an area target using the integral bipod; up to 600 meters when <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> a point target; and up to 200 meters when <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> a moving point target. United States Marine Corps doctrine holds that the M60 and other weapons in its class are capable of suppressive fire on area targets out to 1,500 meters if the gunner is sufficiently skilled.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]333 Jeffery was {{originally}} released with two factory loads, a 250 gr g bullet <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> 2500 ft/s and a 300 gr g bullet <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> 2200 ft/s. The 300 gr round {{has a very}} high sectional density and exceptional penetration. Unfortunately the original 250 gr bullet was a copper-capped hollowpoint that was too fragile to be <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> 2,500 fps, making it unpopular and marring the [...]333 Jeffery's reputation for some time.|$|R
50|$|Scientific {{acoustical}} evidence {{establishes a}} high probability {{that at least two}} gunmen <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> the President.

5|$|Third, {{the aerial}} {{resupply}} lines at Nà Sản were never severed, despite Viet Minh antiaircraft <b>fire.</b> <b>At</b> Điện Biên Phủ, Giáp amassed antiaircraft batteries that quickly {{shut down the}} runway, and made it extremely difficult and costly for the French to bring in reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Vulcan B.1 XA894 flew {{with five}} Olympus engines, the {{standard}} four Mk.101s, plus a reheated Olympus 320 {{destined for the}} BAC TSR-2 in an underslung nacelle. This aircraft was destroyed in a ground <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Filton on 3 December 1962.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the United States Military Academy, Devers was commissioned in the field artillery in 1909. During World War I, he was an instructor at the School of <b>Fire</b> <b>at</b> Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and did not serve in France until after the November 11 armistice ended the fighting, when he attended the French artillery school at Treves. Between {{the two world wars}} he was a staunch advocate of mechanization {{at a time when the}} idea of phasing out horses met strong resistance from conservative gunners.|$|E
5000|$|According to T. Ryle Dwyer, {{the prisoners}} [...] "supposedly" [...] {{got hold of}} hand grenades and threw them. One of the sentries testified that he and a {{colleague}} heard a noise behind them and noticed {{that two of the}} prisoners had thrown the grenades at them. They dived for cover behind some mattresses, but the grenades did not detonate. One of the prisoners was also said to have got hold of a rifle according to one of the guards, which he levelled and <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> the guard commander as he entered the room, but missed. The prisoner then turned the rifle and <b>fired</b> another shot <b>at</b> another guard. The guard said he then <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> the prisoner, and the prisoner dropped, and that the guard commander also <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> the prisoner.The guard commander said, on hearing a noise, he entered the room, and [...] "the prisoner McKee <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> me", and that McKee then turned and <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> the sentry. The guard commander also claimed to have dropped McKee. He then said he saw Clancy with a shovel, and that Clancy was attempting to strike another guard. One of the guards (who had dived behind the mattresses) then <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> Clancy and he fell. A fourth witness was to tell much the same story.|$|R

50|$|Because of its {{lightness}} the 7.5 cm GebG 36 {{would jump}} when <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> low angles as the recoil forces {{would force the}} gun's trail spades {{to act as a}} fulcrum and lever the wheels upwards. In fact Charge 5, the largest propellant increment, was forbidden to be <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> angles under 15° because the gun would jump excessively. <b>Firing</b> <b>at</b> higher angles was perfectly safe as the ground absorbed any residual recoil forces not absorbed by the recoil system.|$|R
5|$|A play, The Doom Bar, about {{smuggling}} and wrecking {{was written}} in the early 1900s by Arthur Hansen Bush. Although there was no interest in London it was well received in America, and was scheduled to tour in Chicago and New York. A series of mishaps, blamed on the legendary wrecker Cruel Coppinger, culminating in a <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Baltimore, caused the play to be considered cursed by America's actors' unions and its members were banned from appearing in it.|$|E

5|$|After Frank Boucher of the New York Rangers won {{the award}} seven times within eight years, Lady Byng was so {{impressed}} that {{she gave him the}} original trophy to keep. Lady Byng then donated a second trophy in 1935–36. When Lady Byng died in 1949, the NHL presented another trophy and changed the official name to the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy. In 1962, the original trophy was destroyed in a <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Boucher's home.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with her}} three sister ships, , , and , Grosser Kurfürst {{took part in}} most of the fleet actions during the war, {{including}} the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The ship was subjected to heavy <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Jutland, but was not seriously damaged. She shelled Russian positions during Operation Albion in September and October 1917. Grosser Kurfürst was involved in a number of accidents during her service career; she collided with König and Kronprinz, grounded several times, was torpedoed once, and hit a mine.|$|E
5|$|American forces boarded Diana {{and rapidly}} removed {{everything}} of value, including guns, rigging, sails, clothing, and money.

The guns recovered were probably used in the American positions during the Battle of Bunker Hill.|$|E
5|$|As the French approached, the British lines {{held their}} fire.
