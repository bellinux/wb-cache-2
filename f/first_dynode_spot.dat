The first method is based on Gaussian distributions for the signal, the second method is based on Poissonian signal distributions and the third approach includes a possible production of photoelectrons at the <b>first</b> <b>dynode.</b> The simulation of MaPMT pulse height spectra is discussed with the additional feature of a possible inhomogeneity in the electron multiplication probability {{across the surface of}} the <b>first</b> <b>dynode.</b> The signal loss below a threshold cut is measured with three methods...|$|R
50|$|The {{electrons}} {{emitted from}} the cathode are accelerated toward the <b>first</b> <b>dynode,</b> which is maintained 90 to 100 V positive {{with respect to}} the cathode.

By the time this process has been repeated at each of the dynodes, 105 to 107 electrons have been produced for each incident photon, dependent on the number of dynodes. For conventional dynode materials, such as BeO and MgO, a multiplication factor of 10 can normally be achieved by each dynode stage.|$|R

In {{view of its}} upgrade {{a possible}} option is {{the adoption of the}} flat panel Photon Multipliers Tubes, PMT. An important issue for the good determination of the rings produced in the sensitive media is a negligible level of cross talk. We have experimentally studied the cross talk from the 64 x 64 pixels of the H 9500 PMT from Hamamatsu. Results have shown that at the single photon signal level, as expected at LHCb, the statistics applied to the small number of electrons generated at the <b>first</b> <b>dynode</b> of the PMT chain leads to a cross talk mechanism that must be interpreted in term of the percentage of the number of induced signals rather than on the amplitude of the induced signals. The threshold to suppress cross talk must be increased to a significant fraction of the single photon signal for the worst case. The number of electrons generated at the <b>first</b> <b>dynode</b> is proportional to the biasing voltage. Measurements have shown that the suppressing threshold can be lowered acting on this latter parameter...|$|R

50|$|A sharply focused beam of {{electrons}} (a cathode ray) is generated by the electron gun at ground potential and accelerated by the anode (the <b>first</b> <b>dynode</b> of the electron multiplier) around the gun at a high positive voltage (approx. +1500 V). Once it exits the electron gun, its inertia makes the beam {{move away from the}} dynode towards {{the back side of the}} target. At this point the electrons lose speed and get deflected by the horizontal and vertical deflection coils, effectively scanning the target. Thanks to the axial magnetic field of the focusing coil, this deflection is not in a straight line, thus when the electrons reach the target they do so perpendicularly avoiding a sideways component. The target is nearly at ground potential with a small positive charge, thus when the electrons reach the target at low speed they are absorbed without ejecting more electrons. This adds negative charge to the positive charge until the region being scanned reaches some threshold negative charge, at which point the scanning electrons are reflected by the negative potential rather than absorbed (in this process the target recovers the electrons needed for the next scan). These reflected electrons return down the cathode ray tube toward the <b>first</b> <b>dynode</b> of the electron multiplier surrounding the electron gun which is at high potential. The number of reflected electrons is a linear measure of the target's original positive charge, which, in turn, is a measure of brightness.|$|R

2500|$|The {{electron}} multiplier {{consists of a}} number of electrodes called dynodes. Each dynode is held at a more positive potential, by ≈100 Volts, than the preceding one. A primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon, or about 3eV for [...] "blue" [...] photons, minus the work function of the photocathode. A small group of primary electrons is created by the arrival of a group of initial photons.

40|$|Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) {{widely used}} in {{neutrino}} detectors are critical to reconstructing {{the direction of the}} neutrino accurately. Large photocathode coverage, compact design and good time properties for single-photoelectron light are essential performances to meet the requirements for the next generation detectors. Therefore, a novel digital optical module housing 31 3 -inch. diameter PMTs is developed. In order to maximize the effective photocathode area and improve the time performance, a modified PMT with a larger photocathode area and 10 dynodes is optimized with the aid of the CST Particle Studio in this paper. Based on the Monte Carlo method and finite integration theory, the main characteristics of the modified PMT, such as uniformity, collection efficiency, gain and transit-time spread, are investigated. As the earlier stages of the PMT contribute the greatest weight to the total transit time spread, the transit time spread of single-photoelectron from photocathode to the <b>first</b> <b>dynode</b> (TTSCD 1) is discussed mainly in this paper. The influences of the dynodes position on collection efficiency and TTSCD 1 are analyzed. The voltage ratio scheme is also optimized slightly to obtain better collection efficiency and minimum TTSCD 1. By tracing the trajectories of secondary electrons from the first to the second dynode stage, dynodes are optimized for improving timing performance and secondary electrons collection efficiency. Direct collection efficiency of secondary electrons from the <b>first</b> <b>dynode</b> to the second is improved from 56. 38 % to 61. 01 %. The effective photocathode diameter of the modified PMT is increased from traditional 72 mm to 77. 5 mm and the effective area of photocathode is increased by 30. 87 % compared with the traditional one. What is more, the length of the new PMT is reduced to 103 mm so that the available space of the multi-PMT digital optical module is increased by 63. 09 % compared with the traditional one containing the high-voltage power supplies, front-end and readout electronics, refrigerating equipment, etc. The simulation results show that the mean collection efficiency of the modified PMT is similar to 96. 40 % with the supply voltage of 1000 V and it changes little by changing the supply voltage from 900 V to 1300 V. The mean transit time spread from photocathode to the <b>first</b> <b>dynode</b> is similar to 1 ns which is better than the transit time spread of the traditional model.

Lately a definite technical improvement in increasing {{quantum efficiency}} up to 42 % for position sensitive photomultipliers was achieved. The aim of this work is thus to test this new technological progress and to study the possible implications in imaging applications. Four Hamamatsu PMTs were tested: two multi anode photomultipliers, one with a bialkali (27 % quantum efficiency) and the other one with a super-bialkali photocathode (38 % quantum efficiency), and two 1 x 1 in. PMTs, both equipped with an ultra bialkali photocathode (42 % quantum efficiency). In particular one of the ultra bialkali PMT has also an increased efficiency of <b>first</b> <b>dynode</b> charge collection. The results were compared with the ones obtained with a reference PMT (Hamamatsu R 6231), mainly used in spectroscopy. The PMTs were coupled to LaBr 3 (Ce), NaI(Tl) and LSO(Ce) continuous scintillation crystals. The tests were done using two independent electronic chains: one dedicated for spectroscopic application and a second one, using a multi wire 64 channel readout, for imaging applications. The super-bialkali MA-PMTs have shown high energy resolution, both with spectroscopic and imaging setup, highlighting the appropriateness of these devices for the development of imaging devices with high spectroscopic performance.

50|$|When an {{ionizing}} particle passes into the scintillator material, atoms are ionized along a track. For charged particles the track is {{the path of}} the particle itself. For gamma rays (uncharged), their energy is converted to an energetic electron via either the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering or pair production. The chemistry of atomic de-excitation in the scintillator produces a multitude of low-energy photons, typically near the blue end of the visible spectrum. The number of such photons is in proportion to the amount of energy deposited by the {{ionizing particle}}. Some portion of these low-energy photons arrive at the photocathode of an attached photomultiplier tube. The photocathode emits at most one electron for each arriving photon by the photoelectric effect. This group of primary electrons is electrostatically accelerated and focused by an electrical potential so that they strike the <b>first</b> <b>dynode</b> of the tube. The impact of a single electron on the dynode releases a number of secondary electrons which are in turn accelerated to strike the second dynode. Each subsequent dynode impact releases further electrons, and so there is a current amplifying effect at each dynode stage. Each stage is at a higher potential than the previous to provide the accelerating field. The resultant output signal at the anode {{is in the form of}} a measurable pulse for each group of photons that arrived at the photocathode, and is passed to the processing electronics. The pulse carries information about the energy of the original incident radiation on the scintillator. The number of such pulses per unit time gives information about the intensity of the radiation. In some applications individual pulses are not counted, but rather only the average current at the anode is used as a measure of radiation intensity.|$|R
