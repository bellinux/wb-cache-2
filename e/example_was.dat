5|$|Although very popular, few prints {{have survived}} and {{impressions}} of the first edition are very rare. A fine <b>example</b> <b>was</b> sold at Christie's New York in 2013 for $866,500, setting a new auction record for the artist.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{to what is}} {{regarded}} as entertainment can occur in response to cultural or historical shifts. Hunting wild animals, for <b>example,</b> <b>was</b> introduced into the Roman Empire from Carthage and became a popular public entertainment and spectacle, supporting an international trade in wild animals.|$|E
5|$|Colonists from England {{also brought}} horses of Arabian {{breeding}} {{to the eastern}} seaboard. One <b>example</b> <b>was</b> Nathaniel Harrison, who imported a horse of Arabian, Barb and Turkish ancestry to America in 1747.|$|E
50|$|The four-drive <b>example</b> <b>is</b> {{identical}} {{to a standard}} RAID 1+0 array, while the three-drive <b>example</b> <b>is</b> a software implementation of RAID 1E. The two-drive <b>example</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to RAID 1.|$|R

5|$|During {{the period}} of ÖVP-FPÖ government, many {{amendments}} were introduced to tighten the country's immigration policies. The number of new asylum applications, for <b>example,</b> <b>was</b> reduced from 32,000 in 2003 to 13,300 in 2006.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} scenes that {{appeared}} in the storyboard and animatic were reordered or dropped altogether in {{the final version of the}} episode. Much of the Maggie subplot, for <b>example,</b> <b>was</b> modified before the episode aired. A scene in which the babies lock Ms. Sinclair in her office is missing from the final version of the episode.|$|E
5|$|A third <b>example</b> <b>was</b> {{applied to}} bus 720 on route 3, with the legend 3 Connect. The base colour here is yellow, and was applied {{together}} with a new interpretation of the classic madder and white livery. The 3 Connect branding was replaced by The Lady Victoria branding in October 2010.|$|E
30|$|In this section, four <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> {{given to}} {{demonstrate}} {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed approaches. The first three <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> presented to show the improvement of our results over the existing ones. The last <b>example</b> <b>is</b> used {{to demonstrate the}} applicability of the controller design method.|$|R
5000|$|Curry - The basic Indian {{vegetable}} or meat gravy. It is now {{ubiquitous in}} local Chinese and Malay 'traditional' cuisine. A Peranakan <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Laksa, whose name {{derives from the}} Sanskrit for 'hundred thousand'. A Eurasian <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Devil curry, while a Chinese <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Chilli crab.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>examples</b> <b>were</b> {{manufactured}} using assorted M1855 lock blanks and {{are mounted}} in iron with high and medium high lockplate humps. Later <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> mounted in brass with a graceful [...] "S" [...] shaped hammer. Only {{the very early}} <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> known to have a patchbox.|$|R
5|$|All {{the tissues}} are in Aristotle's view {{completely}} uniform parts with no internal structure of any kind; a cartilage for <b>example</b> <b>was</b> the same {{all the way}} through, not subdivided into atoms as Democritus (c. 460–c. 370 BC) had argued. The uniform parts can be arranged {{on a scale of}} Aristotelian qualities, from the coldest and driest, such as hair, to the hottest and wettest, such as milk.|$|E
5|$|Although several Roman sources {{including}} Livy and Polybius talk {{extensively about}} the Roman {{army of the}} Roman Kingdom period that followed the Etruscan capture of the city, no contemporary accounts survive. Polybius, for <b>example,</b> <b>was</b> writing some 300 years after the events in question, and Livy some 500 years later. Additionally, what records were kept by the Romans at this time were later destroyed when the city was sacked. The sources for this period cannot therefore be seen as reliable, {{as they can be}} for later military history, e.g. from the First Punic War onwards.|$|E
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early <b>example</b> <b>was</b> the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E

5|$|Even {{after the}} change in effects companies, Yuricich {{continued}} to provide many of the matte paintings used in the film, having previously worked on The Day the Earth Stood Still, Ben-Hur, North by Northwest and Logan's Run. The paintings were combined with live action after a selected area of the frame was matted out; the blue Earth sky over Yellowstone, for <b>example</b> <b>was</b> replaced with a red-hued Vulcan landscape. More than 100 such paintings were used.|$|E
5|$|Gan also {{founded a}} school for the poor {{in the village of}} Sam-toh in Fujian, China, where his forefathers were born, and helped to finance and {{maintain}} the Tranquerah Chinese Free School in Melaka. He also enabled young men of promise to realise their potential by paying for their university education. An <b>example</b> <b>was</b> the case of Wee Theam Tew, who gave up a clerical post with Macalister & Co. and proceeded to England to further his studies in law and qualify for the Bar in 1911.|$|E
5|$|Guthy-Renker had a {{media budget}} of $200 million for Proactive as of 2010, {{much of it}} spent on air-time, and was {{spending}} another $12–15 {{million a year on}} celebrity endorsements. Justin Bieber for <b>example,</b> <b>was</b> paid $3 million over two years. Its infomercials have featured celebrities who have themselves suffered from acne problems; the list includes Kelly Clarkson, P. Diddy, Avril Lavigne, Lindsay Lohan, Alyssa Milano, Katy Perry, Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears and Vanessa Williams.|$|E

5|$|In Tlingit and Haida cultures, raven {{was both}} a trickster and creator god. Related beliefs are {{widespread}} among the peoples of Siberia and northeast Asia. The Kamchatka Peninsula, for <b>example,</b> <b>was</b> {{supposed to have been}} created by the raven god Kutkh. There are several references to common ravens in the Old Testament of the Bible and it is an aspect of Mahakala in Bhutanese mythology.|$|E
5|$|In West Africa, {{the sons}} and daughters of Yoruba kings were {{traditionally}} given in marriage to their fellow royals as a matter of dynastic policy. Sometimes these marriages would involve members of other tribes. Erinwinde of Benin, for <b>example,</b> <b>was</b> taken as a wife by the Oba Oranyan of Oyo during his time as governor of Benin. Their son Eweka went on to give birth to the dynasty that rules the Kingdom of Benin today.|$|E
5|$|Killer whales {{have helped}} humans hunting other whales. One {{well-known}} <b>example</b> <b>was</b> the killer whales of Eden, Australia, including the male known as Old Tom. Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as orcas would gather to scavenge {{meat from the}} whalers' catch. Some populations, such as in Alaska's Prince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.|$|E

30|$|In this section, two <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> used to {{illustrate}} {{the effectiveness of the}} algorithms and to verify the above theoretical results. The first <b>example</b> <b>is</b> used to testify the efficiency of the TWSLD operators, the second <b>example</b> <b>is</b> calculated by the presented numerical schemes (3.21), and the validity of our developed algorithms is confirmed.|$|R
5|$|McCarthy's first group, pornographic parodies, {{includes}} 1976's Tintin en Suisse ("Tintin in Switzerland") and Jan Bucquoy's 1992 work La Vie Sexuelle de Tintin ("Tintin's Sex Life"), featuring Tintin and {{the other}} characters engaged in sexual acts. Another such <b>example</b> <b>was</b> Tintin in Thailand, in which Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus travel to the East Asian country for a sex holiday. The book began circulating in December 1999, but in 2001, Belgian police arrested those responsible and confiscated 650 copies for copyright violation.|$|E
5|$|NORAD's {{tracking}} of Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve, for <b>example,</b> <b>was</b> initiated in 1955 {{and has become}} an annual tradition. The stop motion animated film, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer remains an annual telecast on American televisionalmost fifty years after its debut, and Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas! of 1957 has become a literary Christmas classic.|$|E
5|$|Nixon's {{upbringing}} {{was marked}} by evangelical Quaker observances of the time, such as refraining from alcohol, dancing, and swearing. Nixon had four brothers: Harold (1909–33), Donald (1914–87), Arthur (1918–25), and Edward (born 1930). Four of the five Nixon boys were named after kings who had ruled in historical or legendary Britain; Richard, for <b>example,</b> <b>was</b> named after Richard the Lionheart.|$|E

By results of Ueno, another source of <b>examples</b> <b>is</b> provided by varieties X of maximal Albanese dimension and of general type with p_g(X) = 1. <b>Examples</b> <b>were</b> constructed by Chen and Hacon, and again, we prove that in dimension 3, these <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> (up to abelian étale covers) the only ones.
