5000|$|With falling oil and {{associated}} gas production, and {{depletion of the}} Khuff reserves, developing the North field became imperative. In 1984 {{it was decided that}} development would occur in phases. Phase 1 involved installing production, processing, and transport facilities for [...] of natural gas per day to serve local utilities and produce 5,000 tons per day of propane, butane, gasoline, and naphtha. In 1989 a gas sweetening plant and sulfur processing unit were added. Phase one was online by early 1991. Gas from North Field phase one has been primarily used for local demand, and injection into the Dukhan field. Phase two was expected to involve selling North Field gas to its neighbors, possibly through a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) gas grid. Phase three involved exporting to Europe and Asia. Even before the Persian Gulf War, this phase ran into trouble. To justify the investment, Qatar Petroleum (QP) needed two large-scale long-term supply contracts. Despite efforts from QP managing director Jaber al-Marri, contracts were not forthcoming. This switched emphasis to domestic outlets. In 1988, a firm of international consultants presented a plan to QP for developing domestic projects to utilize Qatari gas. Suggestions included an aluminum smelter, a <b>ferro-alloy</b> production plant, methanol production facilities, and expansion of petrochemical and fertilizer operations.|$|E

40|$|High grade steels, {{particularly}} in flat products {{are associated with}} low levels of dissolved nitrogen. For deep drawing steels it is desirable to keep nitrogen levels below 50 ppm, where as a range of 120 to 150 ppm is acceptable for high strength structural steels (1).
