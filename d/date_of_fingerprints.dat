Matching methods can be of two types-verification <b>of</b> <b>fingerprint</b> and identification <b>of</b> <b>fingerprint.</b> Combination <b>of</b> <b>fingerprint</b> for protecting privacy is a system for guarding fingerprint isolation by integrating two distinct fingerprints into new indirect identity. Fingerprints are taken from FVC databases. In the enrolment phase two fingerprints will be taken from two distinct fingers. We will take out the minutiae position from one fingerprint, from other orientation and from both points of references are taken out. From the information taken out an impression of combined minutiae is generated and deposited in the database.
