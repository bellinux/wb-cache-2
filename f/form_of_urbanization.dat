5000|$|Urban sprawl or {{suburban}} sprawl describes {{the expansion of}} human populations away from central urban areas into low-density, monofunctional and usually car-dependent communities, in a process called suburbanization. In addition to describing a particular <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization,</b> the term also relates to the social and environmental consequences associated with this development. In Continental Europe the term [...] "peri-urbanisation" [...] {{is often used to}} denote similar dynamics and phenomena, although the term urban sprawl is currently being used by the European Environment Agency. There is widespread disagreement about what constitutes sprawl and how to quantify it. For example, some commentators measure sprawl only with the average number of residential units per acre in a given area. But others associate it with decentralization (spread of population without a well-defined centre), discontinuity (leapfrog development, as defined below), segregation of uses, and so forth.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to a lack}} {{of strict}} zoning laws, the {{metropolitan}} areas' growth appears haphazard. Central areas like Yaowarat, Siam, Sukhumvit, and Sathorn have seen skyrocketing land speculation as foreign investors are allowed to own condominiums, giving rise to Manhattanization. At the same time, fringe areas are being developed and the boundaries are no longer visible between each provincial city center. Due to the speed of this urban sprawl over the past twenty years, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration has sought to tackle rising problems of commute times, pollution, and deteriorating air quality. Recent administrations have been relatively successful in tackling the air quality issue, however the city still lacks an effective mass transit network and a clean and effective plan to resolve environmental issues. This <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> is not limited to Bangkok. Traces of it can be found in metropolitan areas where there has been a surge in population. The Pattaya-Chonburi Metropolitan Area is a prime example due to the increase in residential high-rise living and the rush for commercial office space. The shared infrastructure of greater Bangkok and greater Pattaya-Chonburi, being physically close, helps fuel the latter's torrid development.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} new, synthesized perspective for explaining the ??????Nonmetropolitan Turnaround?????? in the 1970 s and 1990 s. By studying the definition <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> carefully, using the human ecological perspective, many processes happening during the ??????Nonmetropolitan Turnaround?????? in the 1970 s and 1990 s, such as suburbanization, deconcentration, and counterurbanization, {{can be understood}} as different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> the <b>urbanization</b> processes. When {{the majority of the population}} was rural, the dominant pattern <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> was rural-urban migration. When the majority of the population became urban, the dominant urbanization pattern reversed to urbanrural migration because urban centers had reached beyond their optimal density and processes operated to reduce their density. This paper hypothesizes that the two ??????turnarounds?????? were simply the result of different aspects <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> complicated by metropolitan status reclassifications. The perspectives of suburbanization, counterurbanization and deconcentration are integrated into the urbanization perspective. Using migration flow data compiled by the Census Bureau from 1975 to 1980 and from 1995 to 2000, the summary analyses confirmed that the net migration due to the three <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> largely accounted for all of the net migrant flows.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{relationship}} between urbanization and {{development is a}} vital policy concern, especially in Africa and Asia. This paper reviews the arguments and evidence for whether rapid urban population growth can help to raise living standards. The main finding is that the development effects <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> and the magnitude of agglomeration economies are very variable. There is no simple linear {{relationship between}} urbanization and economic growth, or between city size and productivity. The potential <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> to promote growth is likely to depend on how conducive the infrastructure and institutional settings are. Removing barriers to rural–urban mobility may enable economic growth, but the benefits will be much larger with supportive policies, markets and infrastructure investments. Cities should use realistic population projections {{as the basis for}} investing in public infrastructure and implementing supportive land policies. Governments should seek out ways <b>of</b> enabling <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> that contribute to growth, poverty reduction and environmental sustainability, rather than encouraging (or discouraging) urbanization per se...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{emergent}} phenomenon know as “desakota”, the rapid urbanization of densely populated rural populations in the newly developed world, particularly China, can be simulated using agent-based models which combine both local and global features.

We develop a simple logic which links local household reform to global urban reform, translating these ideas into a model structure which reflects these two scales. Our model first determines the rate of growth of different spatial aggregates using linear statistical analysis. It then allocates this growth to the local level using developer agents who determine the transformation or mutation of rural households to urban pursuits based on local land costs, accessibilities, and growth management practices.

The results indicate that as a result of in situ urbanization, quasi-urban areas and populations are now so well developed that they have become major components of the rural-urban transition process and have generated complex socio-economic and environ-mental issues, thus posing significant challenges for the conventional rural-urban dichoto-mous approach in urban and regional planning.

40|$|In La Question Urbaine Manuel Castells {{defined the}} urban {{question}} {{in terms of}} the alignment of the city as the spatial unit of organization and the establishment of collective consumption (housing, public transport, water and energy provision, leisure, …). As a historical thesis and framework of analysis Castells’ definition is more dubious than ever as the process <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> is subject to fundamental logics of rescaling and has definitively left the contours of the city as a clearly defined territorial unit. Meanwhile, the context of ‘planetary urbanization’ has led to new situations in which questions of collective consumption, previously associated with the city, give rise to new urban questions within new territorial geometries, calling for new ‘urbanisms’ and new <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> governance. This paper studies three provincial projects of electrification within the context <b>of</b> extended <b>urbanization</b> in Belgium in order to problematize the territorial basis of the question <b>of</b> collective consumption. <b>Urbanization</b> in Belgium has historically been marked by what Neil Brenner described as ‘Spatial Keynesianism’: Distributive urban policies led to development models in which a precarious balance was struck between avoiding the problem of collective consumption and the development of alternative modes of providing collective services. Since electricity networks were historically one of the first instances of collective consumption to permeate into the countryside, analyzing them might clarify the logic behind extended <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization.</b> Moreover, studying ‘urban questions’ beyond the city might provide methodological clues on ways in which to move beyond methodological cityism in the study <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> and its politico-ecological implications...|$|R

40|$|In the United States, {{urbanization}} processes {{have resulted}} in a large variety—or “continuum”—of urban landscapes. One entry point for understanding the variety of landscape characteristics associated with different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> is through a characterization of vegetative (green) land covers. Green land covers—i. e., lawns, parks, forests—have been shown to have a variety of both positive and negative impacts on human and environmental outcomes—ranging from increasing property values, to mitigating urban heat islands, to increasing water use for outdoor watering purposes. While considerable research has examined the variation of vegetation distribution within cities and related social and economic drivers, we know very little about whether or how the economic characteristics and policy priorities of green cities differ from those of “grey ” cities—those with little green land cover.

The author analyses two aspects <b>of</b> the <b>urbanization</b> process, the so called physical urbanization and the cultural urbanization (i. e. {{some aspects of the}} urban way of life in rural Macedonia). His study is divided into the following themes: number of urban population as an <b>urbanization</b> measure, transformation <b>of</b> the traditional Macedonian village, some characteristics of the Macedonian village as a territorial community, some <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> <b>of</b> rural settlements, and the conclusion. The basic conceptions elaborated by the author in his study are as follows. Through modern socio- -economic evalutional courses the traditional village in SR Macedonia »retreats« before the progressive modernized village. Due to socio- -economic differentiation of rural population, the rural (local) community is today not just the domicile of agricultural population, but the domicile of other professions as well. At the same time this means that in SR Macedonia the agricultural occupation loses also its economic meaning for the preservation of the rural community. The income coming from other jobs and occupations (in village and town) causes the change in relationship between rural population as well as in intrafamily relations. Farmers-workers, pupils, students and other persons, who are in everyday 2 ̆ 7 s contact with the town, influence the rural community in regard to the way of behaving and living. Through various <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> human interrelations, consumable <b>forms,</b> ways <b>of</b> spending free and leisure time, through building projects and similar, the village becomes all the more urbanized.

40|$|Attempts at {{understanding}} the urbanization process in Southeast Asia have, in recent years, {{focused on the}} emergence of extended metropolitan regions around primate cities. Many have argued that with a landscape of intensively mixed 'rural' and 'urban' activities, such regions represent a distinctive Asian <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> and {{a challenge to the}} conventional urban-rural dualism. The implication, both in theoretical and policy terms, is that such regions of mixed land use form new 'urban' landscapes that will persist into the future on the basis of balanced 'agro-industrial' development. Drawing on fieldwork in a town on Manila's agricultural periphery, this paper argues that such understandings present a static view of these regions, limited by macro-level data and analysis. A more ethnographic understanding of the social processes of 'everyday urbanization' at the interface of the 'urban' and the 'rural' dispels any sense of a stable rural-urban landscape or balanced development. The evidence points to an incompatibility of functions leading to the gradual 'squeezing out' of agriculture due to a changing economic calculus in agricultural households brought on by labour market shifts; environmental conflicts between agricultural and urban-industrial activities; social and cultural transformations in rural society; a political framework of bureaucratic corruption in the regulation of urbanization; and the influence of personalized power relations in agrarian society.

Since 1990 s, there has been an emphasis on the development of mega-urban regions, particularly those surrounding Jakarta as the biggest and the prime city in Indonesia. This research is aimed at elaborating the previous knowledge on the urbanization pattern in Indonesia, and Java in particular.

It is found that the urbanization process in Central Java has transformed the predominantly rural regions in the 1980 s into the urban ones.

40|$|Along {{with the}} likes of public–private {{partnership}} working, transnational networking is commonly cited as one means of coping with the increasingly stringent fiscal climate in which European municipalities have had to operate {{over the past two decades}} or so. The European Commission’s funding of trans-European networks has created new sources of finance for policy development and implementation across a wide range of spheres. The practice of networking itself arguably offers important knowledge spillovers to participating local authorities, and important possibilities in the development of common European urban identities – though significantly these broader benefits may be negated by powerful forces of interlocality competition for private and public investment and by deeply ingrained national patterns of inter-organizational working. In this paper we consider the emergence of one such European network of municipalities – the recently formed edge cities network.

40|$|Globally, world urban {{population}} has been increasing and by 2050 {{it is expected to}} reach 70 % of the world population.

Literatures prove that informal settlements are a major factor in the increase of floods because most of them lack of basic infrastructures and there is poor coordination from the development activities. These together contribute to the increase of vulnerability of informal settlement inhabitants into different risks associated with floods as a result of climatic change. The paper therefore assesses surroundings of informal settlements under the umbrella of factors that cause risks and how they are managed and spell out relevant policy implications. Findings show that factors that increase flood associated risks in the settlement include: housing densification, solid waste management, sewers and drains management, blocked streams, water sources, livestock keeping, and accessibility...|$|R

30|$|The {{development}} {{of industry and}} production in Europe {{during the second half}} of the Twentieth century was fundamental in converting territories into large industrial platforms linked with impressive infrastructure development. It involved agglomerations spread over the land, far from the vertical spatial concept typical of many American factories and some European ones at the beginning of the century. An important example in Europe is Limburg, where the 130 -km long Albertkanaal connecting Liège and Antwerpis able to transport more than the half Belgium’s total production (over 2.7 billion ton-km in 2010). The canal is the real backbone of a territory full of canals, railways, roads and infrastructure, a widespread <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> and impressive industrialization. Various overlapping waves of industrialization, each based on the previous one, have used infrastructures, soil and subsoil, transforming the orography and the environmental system and causing serious problems soil stability problems.

30|$|Smart growth means {{different}} things to different people. Diverse groups and organizations emphasize different selections of its principles. For example, environmentalist groups, such as the Sierra Club, believe uncontrolled outward development is irresponsible and that poorly planned development destroys space, increases traffic, and puts undue pressure on infrastructure facilities (Sierra Club 2001). City officials and urban planners across various urban jurisdictions have interpreted the concept differently and emphasize different principles. While some favor redeveloping existing older areas and repairing existing infrastructures, others stress increasing public transit to reduce vehicle trips and travel miles. Nevertheless, the principles listed in Table  2 are generally considered as key elements of most smart-growth programs. These strategies have one overarching goal: Rather than concentrating development at the urban fringe, urban development efforts should encourage greater compactness and an efficient use of already developed urban areas. In a very broad sense, smart growth is a reaction to the sprawling <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> characterized by low overall densities, unlimited outward and “leapfrogging” expansion of new development, a rigid specialization of land uses, and large-scale conversion of open space and environmentally sensitive lands to urban uses (Filion 2003; Filion and McSpurren 2007; Downs 2005). The concept calls for focusing future growth on existing built-up areas to establish a compact, efficient, and environmentally sensitive pattern of urban development that provides people with various transportation systems and a range of housing and employment choices. Smart growth does not imply no growth; rather, it emphasizes revitalizing the already-built-up environment and, to the extent necessary, fostering compact urban development.|$|E
40|$|Applying complex {{ecosystems}} theory, {{this thesis}} maps and analyzes the codependency of ecological and manufacturing flows affecting cities, the landscape, and the environment. Learning from this analysis, a prototype for a hybrid eco-manufacturing and urban park is proposed on degraded industrial lands. Its design {{is influenced by}} eco-industrial parks including Kalundborg and contemporary urban parks including La Villette, Downsview, and Fresh Kills. The prototype’s design is motivated by the mutating spatiality caused by contemporary trends in North American manufacturing and the degrading environmental state of the Great Lakes. The horizontal expansion of post-Fordist industrial areas on the urban periphery of North American cities has helped lead decentralization of core urban areas. This organization is becoming vulnerable to future energy and environmental concerns. In Hamilton, this trend has resulted in approximately 3, 400 acres of underutilized contaminated land in its historical bayfront industrial areas. The hybrid park prototype will incubate reuse of a 576 acre site within this land by creating a network of eco-operations and public spaces. As part of North America’s Great Lakes, Hamilton Harbour drains into the head of Lake Ontario. The Port of Hamilton’s manufacturing activity strains the ecological systems of these lakes. Some of the most problematic discharge into Hamilton Harbour occurs at Windermere Basin. The basin {{is surrounded by a}} twilight industrial area that contaminates its water, soil, and air. This will be the location of the hybrid park prototype. Light manufacturing spaces that treat industrial contamination will be designed. Their organization will hypothesize a new <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> based on environmentally benign uses of energy and materials...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the 19 th and 20 th century, {{infrastructure}} design increasingly became sectorized and rationalized. As a result, {{the dependency}} between urbanization {{and natural resources}} today often seems to follow wasteful, unsustainable and contradicting logics. In order to reach a Regional Sustainable Development, {{there is a need}} to develop urban design tools for imagining new (life) cycles in which we create infrastructural synergies and connect wasted resources. In order to make complex transition processes visible and understandable, these tools should integrate multiple layers of tangible and intangible components, including the spatial footprints or systems related to the transitions. The proposed urban design tool aims to contribute to envisioning transition. The systemic transect will be further developed in collaboration with stakeholders and decision-makers throughout transition processes. The tool is being developed through research by design in Central Limburg, a region in full materials and energy transition. The systemic transect is conceived as a visual as well as analytical and designerly tool for envisioning complex transition processes, involving stakeholders as well as envisioning the spatial potential of transitions towards less resource dependent <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|University, {{his final}} project {{being on the}} {{political}} economy <b>of</b> sustainable <b>urbanization.</b> While working through his M. A., Martin was a manager of the Ottawa office of an environmental and civil engineering consulting firm called the C 3 Group. Martin is currently a doctoral student at School of Environment and Sustainability at the University of Saskatchewan. His research focus is on socio-technical transitions to urban energy decentralization. This paper endeavours to offer a preliminary overview and {{a survey of the}} key issues related to the political economy <b>of</b> sustainable <b>urbanization.</b> In order to accomplish this, an assessment <b>of</b> three key <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> will be addressed: the slums of the developing world, the middle class suburb, and the metropolitan megacity. As environmental degradation is increasing towards unsustainable levels, both political and economic forces in the global realm are paralyzed in producing effective ameliorative change. Conventional political power that has historically been yielded by the nation-states of the world is beginning {{to make way for a}} more decentralized power dynamic. Cities are becoming increasingly relevant in the global sphere and may become elements of positive change in the future. In addition, cities are ever expanding as a result of a mass exodus of rural dwellers to urban centres. A political economy <b>of</b> sustainable <b>urbanization,</b> then, entails the understanding that although the scope of concerns related to climate change are global, the solutions and forces for change may in fact be more localized, particularly at the urban level.
