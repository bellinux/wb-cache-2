40|$|International audienceDue to the {{development}} and popularization of Internet, there {{is more and more}} research focusing on complex networks. Research shows that there exists community structure in complex networks. Finding out community structure helps to extract useful information in complex networks, so the research on community detection is becoming a hotspot in recent years. There are two remarkable problems in detecting communities. Firstly, the detection accuracy is normally not very high; Secondly, the assessment criteria are not very effective when real communities are unknown. This paper proposes an algorithm for community detection based on hierarchical clustering (CDHC Algorithm). CDHC Algorithm firstly creates initial communities from global central nodes, then expands the initial communities layer by layer according to the link strength between nodes and communities, and at last merges some very small communities into large communities. This paper also proposes the concept of <b>extensive</b> <b>modularity,</b> overcoming some weakness of modularity. The <b>extensive</b> <b>modularity</b> can better evaluate the effectiveness of algorithms for community detection. This paper verifies the advantage of <b>extensive</b> <b>modularity</b> through experiments and compares CDHC Algorithm and some other representative algorithms for community detection on some frequently used datasets, so as to verify the effectiveness and advantages of CDHC Algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{an application of}} a computational tool developed for the extended exergy accounting (EEA) of complex systems. The application is presented in an interactive graphic form to enhance {{its impact on the}} user. The computational part is based on a modular process simulator, originally devised to compute the mass- and energy balances and the exergy accounting of energy conversion systems: the modularity of the code suggested its extension to the analysis of complex energy systems. The main characteristics of the package are its <b>extensive</b> <b>modularity</b> and its ability to handle a wide spectrum of system configurations. The code identifies a system by means of an interconnection matrix, which represents the structural connectivity of the society under examination (i. e. which describes in a synthetic way the interactions of each mass- or energy flux with each sector of that society), and assembles the system of balance equations according to an original protocol. In steady-state simulations, as the one presented here, the code is capable of assembling the proper balance equations starting from the information about an ‘initial state’ of the system, specified by the user together with all necessary constraints. The extension to unsteady operation is not foreseen at the moment. The level of aggregation, the relevant input data and boundary conditions must be assigned by the user, and are scrutinised by the code for internal consistence. Except for this preliminary check, and for the mass- and energy balances at ‘run’ time, the procedure is entirely acritical about the input data, thus allowing a very broad range of sensitivity studies. The total amount of the resources entering the control volume must be assigned, either directly in exergetic form, or otherwise by means of mass- and specific energy flow rate values: the code executes a simple screening on the input data and computes the exergetic value of the incoming flows {{with the help of a}} table of ‘raw exergy data’ available in one of its libraries. Energy- and exergy balances are performed independently: the package generates energy-, exergy- and extended exergy ‘balances’. Irreversible losses are computed separately for each component of the system. The advantage of EEA consists in the inclusion in the system balance of the exergetic equivalent of human work (labour), of capital and of environmental remediation costs. As an application, a series of simulations have been performed on the ‘System Italy’ (on a 1996 database) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{attempt to}} improve {{mechatronic}} design processes is hindered by their complexity. The process complexity is {{mainly caused by}} an <b>extensive</b> process <b>modularity</b> and by the interdependencies of heterogeneous distributed processes which in turn are due to the interrelation of multidisciplinary domains. A new approach is proposed for planning and improving mechatronic design processes by modelling and simulating distributed development processes using object-oriented Petri Nets. For this purpose, this approach not only implements stochastic characteristics of development processes. It integrates design processes from different domains. In summary, a robust tool for planning and analysing mechatronic development processes is created...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{explanations}} for the origin of modularity in genetic and developmental pathways generally assume that modularity confers a selective advantage. However, our results suggest {{that even in the}} absence of any direct selective advantage, genotypic modularity may increase through the formation of new subfunctions under near-neutral processes. Two subfunctions may be formed from a single ancestral subfunction by the process of fission. Subfunction fission occurs when multiple functions under unified genetic control become subdivided into more restricted functions under independent genetic control. Provided that population size is sufficiently small, random genetic drift and mutation can conspire to produce changes in the number of subfunctions in the genome of a species without necessarily altering the phenotype. <b>Extensive</b> genotypic <b>modularity</b> may then accrue in a near-neutral fashion in permissive population-genetic environments, potentially opening novel pathways to morphological evolution. Many aspects of gene complexity in multicellular eukaryotes may have arisen passively as population size reductions accompanied increases in organism size, with the adaptive exploitation of such complexity occurring secondarily...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCommunity {{refers to}} the group of {{entities}} which have similar behavior or characteristic among them. Usually community represents basic functional unit of social network. By understanding the behavior of elements in a community, one can predict the overall feature of large scale social network. Social networks are generally represented in the form of graph structure, where the nodes in it represent the social entities and the edges correspond to the relationships between them. Detecting different communities in large scale network is a challenging task due to huge data size associated with such network. Community detection is one of the emerging research area in social network analysis. In this paper, a spanning tree based algorithm has been proposed for community detection which provides better performance with respect to both time and accuracy. Modularity is the well known metric used to measure the quality of community partition in most of the community detection algorithms. In this paper, an <b>extensive</b> version of <b>modularity</b> has been used for quality assessment...|$|R
40|$|Current routing {{protocols}} for cognitive radio networks are severely {{affected by the}} frequent activity of primary users. Nodes {{that are in the}} interference range of an appearing primary user are not allowed to transmit, and therefore existing routes which utilize such nodes are obliged to undergo a route maintenance phase. This naturally provides other routes to the destination that may incur extra delay or increase packet queuing overhead. In this work, a novel route maintenance protocol is proposed that allows existing routes to endure the event of primary user presence by forming cooperative links between neighboring nodes and nulling out transmission at the primary receiver using cooperative beamforming. Our proposed protocol can be used in conjunction with any of the existing {{routing protocols}}, thus achieving <b>modularity.</b> <b>Extensive</b> simulations are done which prove that our proposed protocol outperforms existing route maintenance techniques in terms of end-to-end delay and loss ratio, with minimal incurred overhead.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{document}} is to present a coherent set of prescriptions about the style, the organization, the documentation and the precautions to be used while developing software in C language. These specifications are particularly important for projects that require the integration and the re-use of software modules developed in a scientific research context by different institutions and people, possibly at different times. While C is a widely used language with a rich availability of compilers, the software designer and developer must be {{fully aware of the}} "low-level" nature of the language, that was born without <b>extensive</b> support for <b>modularity,</b> type checking, etc. It is therefore the responsibility of the designer to assure a high modularity and provisions for documentation, easy maintenance, and re-use. The suggested rules are the result of an analysis of widely adopted rules for "literate" C programming. Contents Introduction 1 1 The Code 3 1. 1 Human semantic aspects : : : [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Space Services and Logistics, Inc. {{represents}} the complete engineering {{design of a}} technically and financially viable commercial space company. The final proposal offers an economically sound program of space vehicles and systems designed to substantially affect a variety of space markets and produce a vertically integrated structure within the next 20 years. Throughout this design process, particular stress {{has been placed on}} attaining the highest possible levels of safety and reliability. The final program financial design requires a considerable initial outlay, but promises a relatively quick return on invested capital, culminating in large annual profits {{by the end of the}} 20 -year scope of the cost outlook. The overall design has been extensively researched and was primarily driven by the present and near-term projected market demands for services uniquely or competitively offered only by space-oriented operations. Heretofore, available capabilities, rather than these market demands, have determined the degree and type of commercial market access. Removing this limitation through <b>extensive</b> use of <b>modularity</b> and reconfigurability allows the company to gear itself to the market, while still remaining extremely competitive with existing systems. The markets identified as lucrative, and that have governed much of the design requirements, are: low-cost launch services to LEO over a wide range of payload masses and inclinations; upper stage payload delivery from LEO to GEO; manned space operations and human transport to and from orbit; EVA assembly and maintenance of large space structures; satellite servicing and repair by both humans and telerobotic operations; a line of customized satellites designed for extended life and capable of reconfiguration or technology upgrade on orbit; small-scale microgravity experimentation and manufacturing supported by spacecraft retrieval capabilities for experimental specimens and manufactured goods; and a full-range of payload integration, testing, design, and support services before launch and once in orbit...|$|R
