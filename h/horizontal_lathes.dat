5000|$|Dipped ware is {{the period}} term used by potters in late 18th- and 19th-century British potteries for {{utilitarian}} earthenware vessels turned on <b>horizontal</b> <b>lathes</b> {{and decorated with}} coloured slip; they are thus a type of slipware. The earliest examples have either variegated surfaces or geometric patterns created {{with the use of}} a rose and crown engine-turning lathe. By the 1790s mocha decoration began to be used, consisting of dendritic (branching) patterns formed by the reaction of the introduction of an acidic coloring agent to the alkalinity of the wet slip surface. Further decorative motifs were developed in the early 19th century, including common cable, called [...] "earthworm" [...] by collectors, as well as [...] "cat's eyes", [...] "dipped fan", and [...] "twig", all collector terms as no surviving period documents have revealed the terminology used by the manufacturers for such motifs. Much of the factory output was intended for export, with large quantities shipped to North America where bowls, mugs, jugs, and other useful forms were used in households and taverns.|$|E

We collect motor load current signals of idling, cylindrical cutting and end cutting processing state in the experiment to process the condition monitoring based on wavelet denoising and wavelet packet transform. We {{take advantage of the}} threshold denoising method to reduce noise of load current signal. Then we use time-frequency analysis methods of wavelet packet transform to extract state characteristic quantity and outstand useful information. So in this paper we monitor the working state of lathes based on the unique advantages of wavelet denoising and wavelet packet transform, and this method can be widely used in various fields of state monitoring...|$|E

Its internal structure and movement form are perplexing, and its real assembling and disassembling involves a large number of parts, and loss or not assembling of small parts often happens. As a result, its assembling and disassembling often takes up a lot of time and efforts. Wit...|$|E

40|$|Productivity {{and surface}} finish are typical user {{manufacturer}} requirements that are restrained by chatter vibrations {{sooner or later}} in every machining operation. Thus, manufacturers are interested in knowing, before building the machine, the dynamic behaviour of each machine structure with respect to another. Stability lobe graphs are the most reliable approach to analyse the dynamic performance. During heavy rough turning operations a model containing (a) several modes, or (b) modes with non-conventional (Cartesian) orientations is necessary. This work proposes two methods which are combined with multimode analysis to predict chatter in big <b>horizontal</b> <b>lathes.</b> First, a traditional single frequency model (SFM) is used. Secondly, the modern collocation method based on the Chebyshev polynomials (CCM) is alternatively studied. The models {{can be used to}} identify the machine design features limiting lathe productivity, as well as the threshold values for choosing good cutting parameters. The results have been compared with experimental tests in a horizontal turning centre. Besides the model and approach, this work offers real worthy values for big lathes, difficult to be got from literature. Basque Country Government, GAITEK program...|$|E

In order to obtain the trend of lathing processing dosage, ordinary <b>horizontal</b> <b>lathe</b> was researched using the power signal frequency spectrum method, through the frequency distribution and the differences of amplitude, the trends of lathing processing dosage was identified. The collected current signal was turned into power signal first, when the cut depth is large, {{it is able to}} identify the trends of processing dosage through the fluctuations of the power signal, but when the cutting depth is small, compared to the power signal of idling state, there is not obvious difference to distinguish them. In this case, the frequency distribution and the differences of amplitude of the power signal were introduced...|$|R
40|$|Over the years, the {{importance}} of the creativity inclusively in the field of design activities was highlighted. In accordance with the opinions of certain researchers, the divergent thinking could contribute to the increase of creative processes efficiency. On the other hand, the axiomatic design method is considered as a method able to stimulate the technical creativity when the problem of designing a mechanical equipment is stated. To increase the efficiency of using the axiomatic design method, the possibility of selecting the most convenient solution among many available solutions could be discussed. The analysis revealed that there are many methods that could be applied in the process of optimum solution selection among many available solutions. In this paper, some aspects concerning the possibilities of using the method of analytic hierarchy process are analyzed, inclusively by considering a case study concerning a device for investigating the universal <b>horizontal</b> <b>lathe</b> rigidity. Afterwards, the first axiom from axiomatic design method was applied to define the selected solution for the approached device...|$|R
50|$|A subtype of <b>horizontal</b> turret <b>lathe</b> is the flat-turret lathe. Its turret is flat (and {{analogous}} to a rotary table), allowing the turret to pass beneath the part. Patented by James Hartness of Jones & Lamson, and first disseminated in the 1890s, {{it was developed}} to provide more rigidity via requiring less overhang in the tool setup, especially when the part is relatively long.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in smart materials have {{renewed interest in}} the development of improved manufacturing processes featuring sensing, processing, and active control. In particular, vibration suppression in metal cutting has received much attention because of its potential for enhancing part quality while reducing the time and cost of production. Although active tool clamps have been recently demonstrated, they are often accompanied by interfacing issues that limit their applicability to specific machines. Under the auspices of the Laboratory Directed Research and Development program, the project titled {open_quotes}Smart Cutting Tools for Precision Manufacturing{close_quotes} developed an alternative approach to active vibration control in machining. Using the boring process as a vehicle for exploration, a commercially available tool was modified to incorporate PZT stack actuators for active suppression of its bending modes. Since the modified tool requires no specialized mounting hardware, it can be readily mounted on many machines. Cutting tests conducted on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>lathe</b> fitted with a hardened steel workpiece verify that the actively damped boring bar yields significant vibration reduction and improved surface finishes as compared to an unmodified tool...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous liquid {{infiltration}} of alumina preforms {{is a well}} known method {{for the production of}} disks to be used in brakes for motorcycles, automobiles and even rail transportation. The pin on disk wear testing is a mean to evaluate the suitability of the Alumina-Aluminum alloy composite for such applications and moreover allows to evaluate the stability of the surface of the rotating composite disk in contact with a stationary counterpart. A series of high velocity dry sliding wear tests were carried out on a properly modified <b>horizontal</b> <b>lathe,</b> against metallic and brake lining counterparts. Friction coefficients as well as the wear rates were determined during pin-on-disk and flat-on-disk tests carried out at different sliding speeds, up to 15 m/s. The sliding speed heavily affects the stability of the composite which showed increasing degradation rate with increasing speed. The microstructural examinations carried out by means of light and scanning electron microscopy showed the important role played by the third body, which enhances delamination, especially during the tests carried out at the highest sliding speed...|$|R
5000|$|When World War II ended, {{the digital}} {{computer}} {{was poised to}} develop from a colossal laboratory curiosity into a practical technology that could begin to disseminate into business and industry. The advent of electronics-based automation in machine tools via numerical control (NC) and then computer numerical control (CNC) displaced to a large extent, but not at all completely, the previously existing manual and mechanically automated machines. Today, most CNC lathes have turrets, and so could logically be called [...] "turret lathes", but the terminology is usually not used that way. <b>Horizontal</b> CNC <b>lathes,</b> with or without turrets, are generally called [...] "CNC lathes" [...] or [...] "CNC turning centers" [...] or [...] "turning centers", and the term [...] "turret lathe" [...] by itself is still usually understood in context to refer to <b>horizontal,</b> manual turret <b>lathes.</b> The changed role in the production process that such machines now play is reflected in another name for them, second-operation lathe, as explained later.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) {{basically}} {{belongs to}} a category of productive systems in which the main characteristic is the simultaneous execution of several processes and sharing a finite set of resource. Analysis and modeling of flexible manufacturing system (FMS) includes priority analysis of machining jobs and machining routing for efficient profit and production. Flexible manufacturing system (FMS) job Priority calculation becomes exceptionally complex {{when it comes to}} contain frequent variations in the part designs of incoming jobs. This paper focuses on priority analysis of variety of incoming jobs into the system efficiently and maximizing system utilization and throughput of system where machines are equipped with different tools and tool magazines but multiple machines can be assigned to single operation. For the complete analysis of the proposed work, a cloud of four incoming jobs have been considered. The Jobs have been assigned the priority according to Slack per Remaining Operations. Usually the probability of incoming job priority is calculated based on three parameters based strategy. In this work an adaptive Neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is developed to calculate the priority of incoming jobs based on Slack per Remaining Operations (S/RO) parameter. Four <b>horizontal</b> CNC <b>lathe</b> machines have been utilized for this work. Therefore, in this paper, an ANFIS system is developed to generate best priority of incoming jobs. The results obtained clearly indicate the higher efficiency of the proposed work to decide the priority of the incoming jobs...|$|R
