500|$|Rick Ross drops by to say hi, {{keeping his}} {{appearance}} so brief that I can't {{help but wonder}} what he's even doing here. Justin Vernon inexplicably bookends the thing, pushing his falsetto into Antony range on the outro and muttering befuddling lyrics {{that have nothing to}} do with the rest of the song. All this over the straight-up funkiest beat Kanye West has made in years, a rippling electro push-pull that adds an effortless strut to his recent progged-out chilliness. But all that other stuff fades into the background when Nicki Minaj shows up. [...] She's a whirlwind of energy, showing her full repertoire of nutso voices and kicking the living <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> of the beat, sounding like she's having an absolute blast the whole time." ...|$|E

[...] Ament said that [...] "Pilate" [...] concerned a question he was asking himself, dealing with a recurring dream Ament had with being old sitting with his dog on the porch, while [...] "Low Light" [...] was the answer, and that it deals with [...] "a kind of gratefulness at finding that place of calm and peace at my center and getting a glimpse of the person I could choose to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Slay Tracks found {{unexpected}} attention {{after the}} Leeds, England-based band The Wedding Present covered [...] "Box Elder" [...] {{on their own}} 1990 EP, Brassneck. The Wedding Present's bassist, Keith Gregory, had been introduced to Slay Tracks by future Pavement bassist Mark Ibold while visiting New York City. The Wedding Present cover {{is different from the}} original in that the line [...] "that I had to get the <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> of this town" [...] was changed to [...] "that I had to get right out of this town". The [...] "Box Elder" [...] cover received radio airplay from influential English disc jockey John Peel, which generated publicity for both The Wedding Present and Pavement. Neither member of Pavement was aware of the cover until Kannberg was informed of it. Kannberg remembered [...] "I was kind of mad. I had no idea that people could do that, so I was all offended." [...] However, his opinion of the cover and its significance later changed: [...] "It was so cool that some band from the UK wanted to cover this obscure, horribly recorded song. At the time I probably never appreciated the full extent of how them covering the song helped Pavement, especially in the UK, but it really did, and I'll always be grateful to them for that." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2009, he {{appealed to}} party activists for £150,000 of extra {{funding for the}} BNP. In the letter, {{he said that the}} party's ailing {{fortunes}} were a direct result of [...] "attacks on the party". He also defended questions by the Electoral Commission about the transparency of BNP funding. In November 2009, Griffin was a witness at the trial of an Asian man, Tauriq Khalid, at Preston Crown Court. The prosecution claimed that in November 2008 Khalid repeatedly drove past a demonstration that Griffin was attending, and on the second occasion shouted [...] "white bastards". Khalid admitted shouting derisory comments at Griffin and other demonstrators, telling the jury he shouted [...] "Nick Griffin, you fucking wanker" [...] and [...] "Get the <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> of Burnley, you're not welcome here", but denied shouting [...] "white bastard". Griffin gave evidence against Khalid, and affirmed that Khalid had shouted [...] "white bastard" [...] at him. Griffin said the man [...] "leaned {{out of the car and}} pointed at me and made a gun and gang gesture", and that he threatened him by shouting [...] "I'm going to...". Griffin said he had left the demonstration early, fearing for his safety. The 23-year-old defendant denied his comments had any racial intent, and was found not guilty. Griffin later commented [...] "I think it's unfortunate and I think it's wrong, but that's the jury's right. They saw all the evidence, I accept their decision. I'm not going to lose any sleep over it." ...|$|E
500|$|In January1994, Simon co-created with comedian George Carlin {{the sitcom}} The George Carlin Show for Fox. It aired for 27 episodes before being {{canceled}} in December1995. Simon served as showrunner throughout its run and directed several episodes. Simon persuaded Carlin {{to do the}} show after writing it as something which would not be [...] "typically sitcomy." [...] He conceived the show as what Carlin's {{life would have been}} like had he never become a comedian; Carlin played a heavy drinking New York taxi driver. Simon commented: [...] "When I was doing The Simpsons, people couldn't see how smart {{it was because of the}} low moments. There's something about this show. People who like it say it's classy. They don't see how vulgar it is." [...] Carlin wrote negatively of his relationship with Simon. On his own website, Carlin wrote of the show: [...] "always check mental health of creative partner beforehand. Loved the actors, loved the crew. Had a great time. Couldn't wait to get the <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> of there." [...] In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words (2009), Carlin elaborated: [...] "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members Alex Rocco, Chris Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... The biggest problem, though, was that Sam Simon was a fucking horrible person to be around. Very, very funny, extremely bright and brilliant, but an unhappy person who treated other people poorly." [...] Simon described himself as [...] "combative" [...] and said that most people see him as having a [...] "bad attitude".|$|E

5000|$|The song {{consists}} {{mainly of}} keyboards and drum machines, along with Prince's vocals. Two verses followed by choruses form the main {{basis of the}} song. The song breaks down to an instrumental section with Prince repeating [...] "I wanna fuck you" [...] followed by him saying [...] "Look here, Marsha; I'm not saying this just to be nasty. I sincerely wanna <b>fuck</b> the taste <b>out</b> of your mouth." [...] The final part of the song is an a cappella with Prince stating his philosophy on life—he loves God for fear of the afterlife but he's going to have fun while he can, a theme echoed in [...] "1999".

2500|$|At a February 2014 {{listening}} {{session for}} the album, Schoolboy Q {{spoke on the}} album's opening track: [...] "When I first made [...] all I wanted to say was that my grandma showed me my first strap.

I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.'

2500|$|A key {{moment in}} that race took place at an all-candidates debate in Montreal on June 2, 1990, where the {{discussion}} quickly turned to the Meech Lake Accord, which had emerged as the major policy issue that divided Martin and Chrétien. At the debate on June 2, 1990, Martin attempted to force Chrétien to abandon the latter's nuanced position on Meech Lake and speak out for or against it, arguing that his position of opposing Meech Lake as it is, but with willing to support with amendments was attempting {{to have it both}} ways. When Chrétien refused to endorse Meech as it was, young Liberal delegates crowding the hall began to chant [...] "vendu" [...] ("sellout" [...] in French), [...] "you're selling out to the Anglos" [...] and [...] "Judas" [...] at Chrétien. One of Chrétien's aides frenetically asked that Martin [...] "get the <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> there and do something" [...] as the Young Liberals continue shouting abuse at Chrétien-to his clear discomfort-only to be told that Quebec youth were [...] "hotheads" [...] whom nobody could control. In private, Chrétien was deeply enraged by the incident, and claimed that the delegates shouting vendu at him were actually Martin supporters from Toronto, charging that their poor French had betrayed that they were not from Quebec. Martin denied involvement in 'coordinating' any response from the floor, or a similar outburst by his supporters at the convention.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, as lead guitarist, Barry Lyde {{joined a}} R group, The Impacts, which {{had formed a}} year earlier with Bob Dames on bass guitar, Mick Hadley on vocals, Fred Pickard on rhythm guitar and Adrian Redmond on drums. The Impacts {{supported}} The Rolling Stones 1965 tour of Australia and when they arrived in Melbourne found another group with the same name, so were renamed The Purple Hearts. They were named for the pep-pills (see purple hearts) favoured by band members – not the US military decoration of same name (see Purple Heart). Their debut recordings were covers of [...] "Gloria" [...] and Graham Bond's [...] "Long Legged Baby" [...] cut to acetate disc in 1965 at Soundtrack Studios, Brisbane. A different version of [...] "Long Legged Baby" [...] was issued as their debut single on Sunshine Records later in 1965. Their highest charting single, [...] "Early in the Morning", was released in October 1966 and peaked at No.24 on Go-Sets National Top40. The band briefly relocated to Sydney {{then moved on to}} Melbourne. They had issued three other singles and an extended play, The Sound of the Purple Hearts before splitting on 23 January 1967. [...] "Dames started calling me Lobby because I would lobby the <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> of people ... My last name's' L-y-d-e, so he put the 'o' in because it rhymed better". 'Lobby' is also used in Queensland for a freshwater crayfish where other Australians would say 'yabby'.|$|E
5000|$|Like many of {{the films}} {{produced}} by the Dark Brothers, Let Me Tell Ya 'bout Black Chicks is controversial. One scene in particular led to {{the withdrawal of the}} film from the home video market. In the scene involving Sahara, Steve Powers, and Mark Wallice, the two men are dressed as members of the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist organization. When the pair encounter Sahara they say [...] "Let's <b>fuck</b> the shit <b>out</b> of this darky!" [...] and begin a series of racist remarks that continues throughout the scene. Despite the insults, or perhaps because of them, Sahara is portrayed as an enthusiastic participant in the sexual encounter, which includes fellatio and double penetration. In relating the encounter to the other maids, Sahara describes the experience as [...] "too good".|$|R
5000|$|These images {{seem to be}} {{inspired}} by the art of Joel-Peter Witkin, as well as Francis Bacon and George Tooker. The video is also very heavily inspired by the Brothers Quay's animated short film Street of Crocodiles. For the television version, certain removed scenes were replaced with a title card that read [...] "Scene Missing," [...] and the instances of the word <b>fuck</b> being edited <b>out</b> were accompanied by a stop in the video motion, making it appear as if the stop {{was a result of}} defective film (this was supposedly done to make sure the flow of the song was not affected). According to director Mark Romanek, the video was filmed using [...] "a slightly out of date film stock but it was still a contemporary film stock.|$|R

[...] While waiting outside, Twan has a nightmare of Sylvester and him in the same situation, being pointed at with guns.

2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} the events following her arrest in Ghazni. American authorities said that two FBI agents, a US Army warrant officer, a US Army captain, and their US military interpreters arrived in Ghazni the following day on 18 July to interview Siddiqui at the Afghan National Police facility where she was being held. They reported they congregated in a meeting room that was partitioned by a curtain, but did not realise that Siddiqui was standing unsecured behind the curtain. The warrant officer sat down and put his loaded M4 carbine {{on the floor by}} his feet near the curtain. Siddiqui drew back the curtain, picked up the rifle, and pointed it at the captain. [...] "I could see the barrel of the rifle, the inner portion of the barrel of the weapon; that indicated to me that it was pointed straight at my head," [...] he said. Then, she was said to have threatened them loudly in English, and yelled [...] "Get the <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> of here" [...] and [...] "May the blood of [...] be on your [...] ". The captain dove for cover to his left as she yelled [...] "Allah Akbar" [...] and fired at least two shots at them, missing them. An Afghan interpreter who was seated closest to her tried to disarm her. At that point the warrant officer returned fire with a 9-millimeter pistol, hitting her in the torso, and one of the interpreters disarmed her. A Justice Department statement said that Siddiqui struck and kicked the officers during the ensuing struggle; [...] "she shout in English that she wanted to kill Americans" [...] and then lost consciousness.|$|E

40|$|This dissertation, {{working in}} concert with a {{parallel}} studio-based investigation culminating in an exhibition of expanded painting outcomes, aims to provide a historical context, theoretical framework and experiential aesthetic vehicle for renegotiating the problem of style. In framing ‘style’ as an open question that bears no singular destination, it seeks to instantiate a dialogue between individually circumscribed notions of subjectivity and the broader contextual markers of space, place and time. Across our present, the sheer multiplicity of contemporaneous artistic activity can sometimes seem like an orgy of competing histories and possibilities all vying for attention. Navigating through this pluralist carnival of possible options, in which all manner of media and disciplinary configuration are noisily meeting and mating, is an activity that can often defy meaningful aesthetic experience. Consequently, this dissertation presents various strategies for making meaningful connections within this ‘all <b>out</b> <b>fuck</b> fest’ of artistic possibilities. To this end, it examines {{the question as to}} why many contemporary artists, myself included, are revisiting and renegotiating the ‘modernist repository’ {{in a manner that is}} no longer effectively described within the now redundant postmodern paradigm. No longer entombed within ironic nostalgia or melancholic longing, many contemporary artists are instead retooling and recalibrating the many great incomplete and unfinished trajectories within modernism as part of a multiplicitous and speculative forward momentum.
