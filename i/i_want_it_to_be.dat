[...] The renovations received some criticisms for being funded by tax-deductible donations, meaning some of it eventually did indirectly come from the tax-paying public.|$|E
500|$|According to Lopez, Anthony had {{the idea}} to {{translate}} [...] "Non Amarmi", an [...] "old Italian song", into Spanish. Two versions of the songs were produced for On the 6, a ballad and a salsa production. The ballad was produced by Dan Shea, while the other was produced by Juan Vicente Zambrano. Lopez stated: [...] "I don't want to be straight Latin! <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more like, y'know, dance-y music-y".|$|E
500|$|Visual {{elements}} employed during Nine Inch Nails concerts {{have often}} included numerous lighting, stage and projection effects employed to accompany and augment presentation.

500|$|Before the album's release, Williams {{spoke about}} his {{hopes for the}} album: [...] "I want people to feel elated, I want them to dance, I want them to forget about {{who they are and}} where they are for 50 minutes – and, within those 50 minutes of [...] forgetting who they are, I also hope people relate to the songs. This is a record that I’m very proud of – I think it’s fucking brilliant. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the record that, if people think of Robbie Williams, they go, Yeah, Reality Killed the Video Star." [...] He also talked about his {{collaboration}} with producer Trevor Horn: [...] "He’s added something to the record that I haven’t had on previous records – his genius".|$|E

"I want {{to write}} my this-is-who-the-fuck-I-am anthem, but I don't {{want it to be}} hidden in poetic wizardry and metaphors. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an attack, an assault on the issue because I think, {{especially}} in today's music, everything gets kind of washy sometimes and the message gets hidden in the lyrical play. Harkening back to the early '90s, when Madonna, En Vogue, Whitney Houston and TLC were making very empowering music for women and the gay community and all kind of disenfranchised communities, the lyrics and the melodies were very poignant and very gospel and very spiritual and I said, 'That's the kind of record I need to make. That's the record that's going to shake up the industry.' It's not about the track. It's not about the production. It's about the song. Anyone could sing 'Born This Way'. It could've been anyone." ...|$|E

"It's {{not really}} a tour, it's more of a {{traveling}} party. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an entire experience from [...] minute you walk in [...] front door to [...] minute I begin to sing. And when it's all over, everyone's going to press rewind and relive it again. [...] It's {{going to be as}} if you're walking into New York circa 1974: There's an art installation in the lobby, a DJ spinning your favorite records in the main room, and then the most haunting performance that you've ever seen on the stage. [...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to go right now,' [...] But to me, the Ball is so important. I want so much to make every depression dollar that everyone spends on my show worth it. And, yeah, I'm paying a lot for it— out of my own pocket. But that's OK. I just don't care about money." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lyrically, I Am Very Far {{is also a}} sharp {{departure}} from their previous work. Whereas previous albums were often composed of highly literate takes on rock legends and tropes, this album's lyrics tend to portray dark and indistinct dreamscapes. Sheff explained that [...] "interiority is a really important thing to me, {{and a lot of}} this record did come from a subconscious, unconscious place, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> respond to that corresponding place in listeners... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> really feel like it was operating on a subterranean level." ...|$|R

5000|$|The bulk of Is the Is Are was {{recorded}} in March 2015 at Strange Weather Recording Studio and The Bunker Studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Regarding the recording process, Smith noted: [...] "I didn’t <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> sound slick or over produced. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> sound human and homemade. And that’s the key <b>to</b> this album, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> show humanity, imperfect and flawed - the album title, the way <b>it</b> {{was recorded}}, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> every element to sound human, then hopefully people can empathise with me rather than judging me." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Rather Die Young" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Beyoncé Beyoncé, Jeff Bhasker, and Luke Steele at Enormous Studios, in Los Angeles, in 2011. Cole Kamen-Green, Alex Asher and Josiah Woodson played the trumpets while Nick Videen and Drew Sayers {{were on the}} tenor and alto saxophones. The horn were arranged by Shea Taylor. Jordan Young then recorded Beyoncé's vocals at the MSR Studios and KMA Studios, in New York City; Steele and Billy Kraven served as background vocalists. Tony Maserati mixed the track, while Pete Wolford, Ryan Kelly, Serge Nudel, Justin Hergett and Jon Castelliall all assisted in the audio engineering of [...] "Rather Die Young"; both tasks were executed at the RMC Studio, in Los Angeles. Speaking about what motivated her to record a song in the vein of [...] "Rather Die Young", Beyoncé said: [...] "I really {{want people to think}} when they listen to my music. I want it to help them through their painful memories, their painful moments, and their most happy moments. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a conversation." ...|$|E
500|$|Goldfaden {{wrote that}} this {{attitude}} put him [...] "pure and simply {{at war with}} the public." [...] His stage was not to be merely [...] "a masquerade"; he continued: [...] "No, brothers. If I have arrived at having a stage, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a school for you. In youth you didn't have time to learn and cultivate yourself... Laugh heartily if I amuse you with my jokes, while I, watching you, feel my heart crying. Then, brothers, I'll give you a drama, a tragedy drawn from life, and you, too, shall cry – while my heart shall be glad." [...] Nonetheless, his [...] "war with the public" [...] was based on understanding that public. He would also write, [...] "I wrote Di kishefmakhern (The Witch) in Romania, where the populace – Jews as much as Romanians – believe strongly in witches." [...] Local superstitions and concerns always made good subject matter, and, as Bercovici remarks, however strong his inspirational and didactic intent, his historical pieces were always connected to contemporary concerns.|$|E
500|$|CDs were {{submitted}} to Weiland containing music in completed demo form, including scratch melodies, which Weiland {{had the option}} to use or discard. Dean did not mind when his melodies were not accepted by Weiland. [...] "hen I write a song, I know what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> melodically. But Scott always... knocks my melodies out of the water." [...] Weiland worked on the lyrics using these demo arrangements, often making suggestions for musical phrases to be doubled or moved. Weiland was credited for the lyrical melodies, but Robert pointed out, [...] "This record was made {{in a way that}} Scott wasn't really there for the creation of these songs, musically." [...] However, both Dean and Robert would be surprised at the direction Weiland would take the songs, which could have been composed with an entirely different vision. Robert found this to be a strength within the band. [...] "People always have this misconception that a band all need to think alike... so many different ways of looking at songs and [...] put together, and that's really the beauty of a great band".|$|E

Of its title he said [...] "The Sufi side of life has helped me with my killer side so I try not to attach myself to any label.

500|$|A {{week before}} the tour began, Spears said of the show: [...] "I come from Broadway, so <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very theatrical. The whole process for me is magical. Hopefully it will be {{something}} people have never even imagined or envisioned in their head. I {{was going through a}} run-through yesterday and was thinking, 'By the time I'm 30, there's not going to be anything left for me to do'". Initial rehearsals for the band started on September 9, 2001. She joined them later after rehearsing the choreography in Los Angeles. [...] The setlist was composed mostly by songs from Britney. She explained her decision in a press conference, saying, [...] "I just want my fans to see me in a different light than they have ever seen me [...] before. This music I am singing right now is such a reflection of me and who I am. Hopefully [...] will come to the show and be inspired and have a lot of fun." [...] Several songs from her previous albums ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again were remixed by Robson to [...] "take [...] in a new direction– flip [...] up a bit".|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wrote the}} initial idea for 'One Sweet Day' with Walter, and I had the chorus...and I stopped and said, 'I really wanna {{do this with}} Boyz II Men,' because...obviously I'm {{a big fan of}} theirs and I just thought that the work was crying out for them, the vocals that they do, so I put it away and said, 'Who knows if this could ever happen, but I just don't wanna finish this song because <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> our song if we ever do it together. [...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [...] was finished, they looked at each other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had {{basically}} the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then and there. We were all kinda flipped about it ourselves. Fate {{had a lot to do}} with that. I know some people won't believe it, but we wouldn't make up such a crazy story." ...|$|E
500|$|Both campaigns {{began to}} use their running mates to attack the other candidate. Republican Vice Presidential nominee Spiro Agnew criticized the current Vice President for being [...] "soft on communism" [...] and [...] "soft on {{inflation}} and soft on law and order." [...] He then compared the nominee to former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. But Agnew often made gaffes on the campaign trail, in contrast to Muskie who {{was viewed as a}} natural campaigner. In Missouri, in preparation for a meeting with former President Harry Truman, Muskie tried to defend his running mate from connections made by the Nixon campaign to the Johnson administration. He reversed the accusation by claiming that Nixon should be held accountable for the shortcomings of the Eisenhower Administration, under his logic. He then lambasted the Republican ticket for ignoring such issues as urban renewal, housing, and federal aid for education and sewage. Muskie was renowned for his speaking ability, and was known to turn around hostile crowds including one well publicized event when he asked an anti-war protester to join him on the stage. Although he provided a small boost for the campaign, Nixon remained fifteen points ahead, 44% to 29% in the September 27 Gallup poll. Diplomat George W. Ball soon resigned his position in the Johnson administration to campaign for and advise Humphrey, hoping to prevent a Nixon victory. At the end of September, Humphrey's chances for the presidency further declined as media outlets observed that the Republican Party would be the likely winners in the election. Humphrey acknowledged his odds, proclaiming at an event in Boston: [...] "regardless of the outcome of this election, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> said of Hubert Humphrey that at an important and tough moment of his life he stood up for what he believed and was not shouted down." [...] The comment drew boos from the crowd. Individuals close to the campaign noted that Humphrey looked tired and worn-out while flying from stop to stop, but would brighten up when he encountered a crowd.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to Japanese musicians, several Irish artists contributed to Creid, including uilleann piper Davy Spillane—formerly of Moving Hearts and Riverdance—and Máire Breatnach, {{who had previously}} played fiddle on another Square album, Final Fantasy IV Celtic Moon. Mitsuda also asked guitarist Tomohiko Kira and singer Yoko Ueno to appear to the album after an acquaintance introduced him to them. [...] Hidenobu [...] "KALTA" [...] Ootsuki worked on the album as an arranger and felt his work was made easier by his familiarity with Mitsuda's music—Creid was his second arrangement project with Mitsuda, after , which he had worked on three years before. According to Ootsuki, Mitsuda and he were complementary in style, which resulted in an album leaving {{a lot of space}} and freedom for the listeners' imagination. He felt that, since Chrono Trigger, Mitsuda's musical style had changed to use less [...] "strong" [...] notes and include more sophistication; upon hearing the Xenogears tracks he [...] "literally" [...] "couldn't wait" [...] to arrange them. Mitsuda has described their collaborative style as that he would first create the [...] "basic backbone" [...] of the song and form the idea of how he wanted the song [...] "to turn out", then take the result to Ootsuki for them to arrange together. The end result would then be changed in the process of recording, as [...] "what sounds good on a synth module doesn't always sound good on live instruments", and occasionally the recording artists would [...] "ad-lib" [...] parts that would make it into the final product. Mitsuda generally also chose the specific percussion instruments to be used while recording, rather than beforehand; he feels that [...] "as long as the final product turns out to be like what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> the process doesn't really matter too much". As working with the other artists gave him a sense of celebration, Mitsuda named the [...] "imaginary band" [...] of performers Millennial Fair and credited them as such in the album.|$|E
