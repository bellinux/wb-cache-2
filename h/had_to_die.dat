5|$|Despite the warlike {{customs of}} the Vikings, {{there was an}} element of fear {{surrounding}} death and what belonged to it. If the deceased was a revenant or draugr, such a sight was frightful and ominous and usually it was interpreted {{as a sign that}} additional family members would die. It was first and foremost in times of starvation, when communities were struck with a series of misfortunes, that rumours about revenants began to flourish. The sagas tell of drastic precautions being taken after a revenant had appeared. The dead person <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> anew; a stake could be put through the corpse, or its head might be cut off in order to stop the deceased from finding its way back to the living.|$|E

500|$|Once a Zoroastrian family {{converted}} to Islam, {{the children had}} to go to Muslim religion school and learn Arabic and the teachings of the Quran and these children lost their Zoroastrian identity. These factors continued to contribute to increasing rates of conversion from Zoroastrianism to Islam. A Persian scholar commented, “Why so many <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> or suffer? Because one side was determined to impose his religion upon the other who could not understand." ...|$|E

500|$|The show's creators {{are also}} willing to kill off major {{character}}s, so that viewers cannot {{assume that a}} given character will survive simply because of a starring role or popularity among fans. In {{response to a question}} on why a certain character <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> David Simon said, [...] "We are not selling hope, or audience gratification, or cheap victories with this show. The Wire is making an argument about what institutions—bureaucracies, criminal enterprises, the cultures of addiction, raw capitalism even—do to individuals. It is not designed purely as an entertainment. It is, I'm afraid, a somewhat angry show".|$|E
500|$|The Sun is a {{population}} I star; {{it has a}} higher abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium ("metals" [...] in astronomical parlance) than the older population II stars. Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, so {{the first generation of}} stars <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> before the Universe could be enriched with these atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals, whereas stars born later have more. This high metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the Sun's development of a planetary system because the planets form from the accretion of [...] "metals".|$|E
500|$|This episode {{concluded}} the story arc about Charlie's death, which began {{earlier in the}} season when Desmond prophesied Charlie's death. [...] Throughout the season, Charlie escaped death; however, Desmond told Charlie that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> in order for his girlfriend, Claire Littleton, to get rescued from the island. [...] The storyline of Charlie's death was conceived while producing {{the latter part of the}} second season, after the storyline of Charlie's drug addiction finished. [...] The news of his character's death was broken to Monaghan two episodes in advance, to which Monaghan felt [...] "relief" [...] for knowing the future of his job on the show. [...] On the night of Monaghan's second-to-last day on set, he was presented with a canoe paddle that had been made by the cast and crew. [...] Monaghan hoped to return to Lost as a guest star in flashbacks or dreams.|$|E

500|$|The {{mayor of}} Rajneeshpuram, David Berry Knapp (known as Swami Krishna Deva or KD), turned state's {{evidence}} and gave {{an account of}} {{his knowledge of the}} Salmonella attack to the FBI. He claimed that Sheela said [...] "she had talked with [...] about the plot to decrease voter turnout in The Dalles by making people sick. Sheela said that [...] commented that it was best not to hurt people, but if a few died not to worry." [...] In Miller's , this statement is attributed to Sheela: According to KD's testimony, she played doubters a tape of Rajneesh's muffled voice saying, [...] "if it was necessary to do things to preserve [...] vision, then do it," [...] and interpreted this to mean that murder in his name was fine, telling doubters [...] "not to worry" [...] if a few people <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> The investigation uncovered a September 25, 1984, invoice from the American Type Culture Collection of microbes, showing an order received by the Rajneeshpuram laboratory for Salmonella typhi, the bacterium that causes the life-threatening illness typhoid fever.|$|E
500|$|Röhm {{was held}} briefly at Stadelheim Prison in Munich, while Hitler {{considered}} his future. In the end, Hitler decided that Röhm <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> On July 1, at Hitler's behest, Theodor Eicke, Commandant of the Dachau concentration camp, and his SS adjutant Michel Lippert visited Röhm. Once inside Röhm's cell, they {{handed him a}} Browning pistol loaded with a single bullet {{and told him he}} had ten minutes to kill himself or they would do it for him. Röhm demurred, telling them, [...] "If I am to be killed, let Adolf do it himself." [...] Having heard nothing in the allotted time, they returned to Röhm's cell at 14:50 to find him standing, with his bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance. Eicke and Lippert then shot Röhm, killing him. In 1957, the German authorities tried Lippert in Munich for Röhm's murder. Until then, Lippert {{had been one of the}} few executioners of the purge to evade trial. Lippert was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison.|$|E
500|$|Another {{anti-hunting}} demonstration {{becomes the}} film's focus, {{this time on}} the Isle of Wight. Nudity and intercourse are practiced freely amongst the demonstrators, and this is contrasted with ancient hunter-gathering groups, who had strict rules concerning nudity. The narrator argues that once hunting had left this group of people, so did their rules toward nudity. Also highlighted is the contradiction that though this people are against hunting, thousands of farm-raised animals <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> to support them. The focus changes to Humboldt penguins, which cannot hunt because of polluted waters, and thus seem detached and without focus. This effect is compared to modern day Eskimos, who no longer hunt since the discovery of oil in their homeland and have fallen into depression and melancholy. To reverse the process, several groups of men go out and revive their hunting ways. Reflected in this is a montage of gun ownership, which the film relates to feelings of masculinity, followed by shots of illegal elephant poaching from Africa. To offset the dwindling number of game due to poaching, warriors from the Lobi tribe celebrate the [...] "Ceremony of Life", in which they masturbate with ceremonial rods and pour the product into the river, hoping the animals will drink the semen and multiply. Attention shifts to large electronic probes in the Peruvian savanna {{used to measure the}} winds of El Niño for optimal fishing conditions. Fishing birds are also electronically tagged so the prime fishing areas can be located based on the birds' fishing habits. This fish frenzy in South America is reflected in the salmon run in Alaska, where kodiak bears hunt and fight for prey.|$|E

500|$|Other Enterprise {{crew members}} include the ship's first officer William Riker, played by {{director}} Jonathan Frakes. Frakes {{said he did}} not have much difficulty directing and acting at the same time, having done so on the television series. Brent Spiner portrays the android Data; rumors before the film's release suggested that since Data's skin had been largely removed {{at the end of the}} story, it would allow another actor to assume the role. LeVar Burton plays Geordi La Forge, the ship's chief engineer. La Forge is a blind character, and for the television series and previous film had worn a special visor to see. Burton lobbied for many years to have his character's visor replaced so that people could see his eyes, since the [...] "air filter" [...] he wore prevented the audience from seeing his eyes and limited his acting ability. Moore finally agreed, giving the character ocular implants that were never explained in the film, beyond showing they were artificial. Gates McFadden plays Beverly Crusher, the ship's doctor. McFadden considered Star Trek women finally on par with the men: [...] "We've come a long way since Majel Barrett was stuck in the sick bay as Nurse Chapel in the [...] and made to dye her hair blond." [...] Crusher was instrumental in helping Picard set the auto-destruct sequence, to prevent the Borg from completely assimilating the Enterprise and Earth. Ship's counselor Deanna Troi is portrayed by Marina Sirtis. The actress missed working on the television show, and was acutely aware that expectations and stakes for First Contact were high: [...] "we were scared that people thought we couldn't cut it without the original cast", she said. Other Starfleet members included former Enterprise chief of security, and commander of the USS Defiant, Worf (Michael Dorn). The Defiant is badly damaged in the battle with the Borg but is left salvageable. An early screenplay draft called for the Defiant to be destroyed, but Deep Space Nine executive producer Ira Steven Behr objected to the destruction of his show's ship and so the idea was dropped. Neal McDonough plays Hawk, the Enterprise helmsman who aids in the defense of the ship until he is assimilated and killed. McDonough was cavalier about his role as an expendable [...] "redshirt", saying that since one of the characters in the deflector dish battle <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> [...] "that would be me".|$|E
500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except {{for one of his}} brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it easy with your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; then you will notice a wisp of cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although London was a socialist, he {{invested}} the semi-autobiographical {{character of}} Martin Eden with strong individualism. Eden {{comes from a}} working-class background, but he seeks self-improvement rather than improvement for his class as a whole. Quoting Nietzsche and Herbert Spencer, he rejects the [...] "slave morality" [...] of socialism, even at socialist meetings. Nevertheless, London stresses that it is this individualism that eventually leads to Eden's suicide. He described the novel as a parable {{of a man who}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> [...] "not because of his lack of faith in God, but because of his lack of faith in men".|$|E

Frog proceeded to juggle the jar from foot to foot and accidentally dropped it, [...] thus letting 'death' out, whereby everything from that point on <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> As a symbolic reference to this story, George is frequently shown caring for an albino Argentine Horned Frog (also known as a Pacman frog) identical to the one shown during the opening narration.|$|E
2500|$|Toby Harnden {{said that}} IRA members in South Armagh {{who talked to}} him in the late 1990s {{generally}} condemned the massacre. One of them, Volunteer M, was quoted as saying that it was [...] "a gut reaction [...] and a wrong one. The worst time in my life was in jail after Kingsmill. It was a dishonourable time". Another, Volunteer G, was quoted as saying that he [...] "never agreed with Kingsmill". Republican activist Peter John Caraher said that those ultimately responsible were [...] "the loyalists who shot the Reavey brothers". He added, [...] "It was sad that those people [...] <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> but I'll tell you something, it stopped any more Catholics being killed". This view was reiterated by a County Tyrone republican and Gaelic Athletic Association veteran who spoke to Ed Moloney. [...] "It's a lesson you learn quickly on the football field... If you're fouled, you hit back", he said. Colin Worton, whose brother was killed in the massacre, said [...] "Kingsmill did stop Catholics being killed in South Armagh, but that doesn't justify it".|$|E

[...] Moreover, Noah told them that they would be taken as a curse for all future generations, as [...] says, [...] "their portion is cursed." [...] And Rabbi Jose of Caesarea taught that the words, [...] "he turns not by the way of the vineyards," [...] {{indicate}} that as the people worked in their vineyards, they asked Noah what prevented God from bringing the Flood at that moment.
