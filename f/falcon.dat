5|$|The {{peregrine}} <b>falcon</b> is host to a {{range of}} parasites and pathogens. It is a vector for Avipoxvirus, Newcastle disease virus, Falconid herpesvirus 1 (and possibly other Herpesviridae), and some mycoses and bacterial infections. Endoparasites include Plasmodium relictum (usually not causing malaria in the peregrine <b>falcon),</b> Strigeidae trematodes, Serratospiculum amaculata (nematode), and tapeworms. Known peregrine <b>falcon</b> ectoparasites are chewing lice, Ceratophyllus garei (a flea), and Hippoboscidae flies (Icosta nigra, Ornithoctona erythrocephala).|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} <b>falcon</b> is {{the national}} animal of the United Arab Emirates. Since 1927, the peregrine <b>falcon</b> has been the official mascot of Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. The 2007 U.S. Idaho state quarter features a peregrine <b>falcon.</b> The peregrine <b>falcon</b> has been designated the official city bird of Chicago.|$|E
5|$|A 2014 {{study of}} falcons of {{different}} species (gyrfalcon, saker <b>falcon,</b> and peregrine <b>falcon)</b> used video cameras mounted {{on their heads}} or backs to track their approaches to prey. Comparison of the observed paths with simulations of different pursuit strategies showed that these predatory birds used a motion camouflage path consistent with CATD.|$|E

50|$|The 1980 Atlanta <b>Falcons</b> {{season was}} the <b>Falcons</b> 15th season. It {{was the first}} season {{division}} title in franchise history. After a 3-3 start the <b>Falcons</b> went on a nine-game winning streak as Quarterback Steve Bartkowski has a career season passing for 3,544 yards while connecting on 31 Touchdown passes, as the <b>Falcons</b> won their first ever division Championship. The <b>Falcons,</b> would earn home field throughout the playoffs. Playing before 60,022 fans at Fulton County Stadium the <b>Falcons</b> lead the Dallas Cowboys 24-10 in the 4th Quarter. However, the Cowboys would score 20 points to stun the <b>Falcons</b> 30-27.|$|R

5|$|BGSU's {{official}} mascots are Freddie and Frieda <b>Falcon.</b> Freddie <b>Falcon</b> {{began appearing}} at athletic events in 1950, while Frieda {{first appeared on}} February 25, 1966 as Mrs. Freddie <b>Falcon.</b> Frieda returned in the 1980–81 academic year as Freddie’s little sister. 1980 marked the first official female Frieda after the 1966 version was played by a male cheerleader. Freddie and Frieda routinely make appearances at BGSU athletic events and other major events around campus and the community. In a similar tradition to SICSIC, {{the identities of the}} students who play Freddie and Frieda are not revealed {{until the end of the}} basketball and hockey seasons.|$|E
5|$|Barbary falcons have a {{red neck}} patch but {{otherwise}} differ in appearance from the peregrine proper merely according to Gloger's Rule, relating pigmentation to environmental humidity. The Barbary <b>falcon</b> has a peculiar way of flying, beating only {{the outer part}} of its wings like fulmars sometimes do; this also occurs in the peregrine, but less often and far less pronounced. The Barbary falcon's shoulder and pelvis bones are stout by comparison with the peregrine, and its feet are smaller. Barbary falcons breed {{at different times of}} year than neighboring peregrine <b>falcon</b> subspecies, but they are capable of interbreeding. There is a 0.6–0.7% genetic distance in the peregrine-Barbary <b>falcon</b> ("peregrinoid") complex.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus cassini, {{described}} by Sharpe in 1873, {{is also known}} as the Austral peregrine <b>falcon.</b> It includes kreyenborgi, the pallid <b>falcon,</b> a leucistic morph occurring in southernmost South America, which was long believed to be a distinct species. Its range includes South America from Ecuador through Bolivia, northern Argentina, and Chile to Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands. It is non-migratory. It is similar to nominate, but slightly smaller with a black ear region. The variation kreyenborgi is medium grey above, has little barring below, and has a head pattern like the saker <b>falcon,</b> but the ear region is white.|$|E

5|$|The {{peregrine}} <b>falcon</b> {{belongs to}} a genus whose lineage includes the hierofalcons and the prairie <b>falcon</b> (F.mexicanus). This lineage probably diverged from other falcons {{towards the end of}} the Late Miocene or in the Early Pliocene, about 5–8million years ago (mya). As the peregrine-hierofalcon group includes both Old World and North American species, it is likely that the lineage originated in western Eurasia or Africa. Its relationship to other falcons is not clear, as the issue is complicated by widespread hybridization confounding mtDNA sequence analyses. For example, a genetic lineage of the saker <b>falcon</b> (F.cherrug) is known which originated from a male saker producing fertile young with a female peregrine ancestor, and the descendants further breeding with sakers.|$|E

5|$|The red-billed chough's predators {{include the}} {{peregrine}} <b>falcon,</b> golden eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl, while the common raven will take nestlings. In northern Spain, red-billed choughs preferentially nest near lesser kestrel colonies. This small insectivorous <b>falcon</b> is better at detecting a predator and more vigorous in defence than its corvid neighbours. The breeding {{success of the}} red-billed chough {{in the vicinity of}} the kestrels was found to be much higher than that of birds elsewhere, with a lower percentage of nest failures (16% near the <b>falcon,</b> 65% elsewhere).|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 300 {{species of}} birds {{are found in the}} forest {{at least part of the}} year. Bald eagle, peregrine <b>falcon,</b> Swainson’s hawk and the prairie <b>falcon</b> are birds of prey that are relatively common. Waterfowl such as Western grebe, Northern pintail, Great blue heron and Barrow’s goldeneye have stable populations and rare sightings of Trumpeter swans are reported. pheasant, ruffed grouse and wild turkey are widely distributed across the open sage lands. Harlequin duck and northern goshawk are generally rare but management plans were implemented to protect various habitats these two species frequent to try and increase their population numbers.|$|E
