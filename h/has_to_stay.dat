5|$|Amy and Rory {{discover}} that the wounded Doctor had told his earlier self to create a diversion, allowing him to rig the Pandorica to fly into the TARDIS explosion. The Doctor postulates that enough of the original universe still exists in the Pandorica to completely restore it via the exploding TARDIS. After a tearful farewell to Amy, Rory, and River where he instructs Amy to focus on her family and Rory to restore them in the new universe, the Doctor engages the Pandorica and flies it into the exploding TARDIS. A second Big Bang occurs. The Doctor comes to consciousness and begins witnessing events in his life in reverse as {{the cracks in the}} universe close. The Doctor <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> outside this new universe in order for that to happen. After a final goodbye to Amelia on the night they met, he enters the cracks and disappears.|$|E
5|$|In the Dunphy household, Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) {{are furious}} at Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) for barging into their room {{while they were}} changing. This leads to their mother, Claire (Julie Bowen) to yell at them, while their dad, Phil (Ty Burrell) {{attempts}} to push himself away from Claire's anger behind her back. Annoyed, Claire confronts Phil about how he always makes her play the 'bad cop' role in their family and keeps the 'good cop' role for himself. He reluctantly agrees to switch roles with her. Claire takes Manny and Luke go-carting (although Phil had been quite keen to go), while Phil <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> and make the girls clean their bathroom. The go-carting goes horribly as Claire, trying to be fun, crashes her cart into the boys, and makes them order large quantities of food. While driving home, Luke gets sick from drinking a milkshake he did not want. Meanwhile, Phil goes berserk when the girls lie to him about cleaning the bathroom and jump on their car {{to stop them from}} leaving, before forcing them to clean the bathroom under his direct supervision and then he had them clean his bathroom. That evening, Phil and Claire admit that they cannot handle each other's natural parent roles, and agree to go back to normal.|$|E

25|$|Islam forbids {{intercourse}} {{outside of}} marriage; like Judaism {{the term is}} Zina/Zena. However, maintaining celibacy {{as an act of}} piety is not recognized, while marriage for all who are able is strongly encouraged. Abstinence is practiced during the time of a woman's menstruation. Abstinence from sexual intercourse is also practiced from dawn to dusk during days where fasting is observed. Also in the time of Hajj people are not allowed to have sexual relationships, because their body <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> pure while performing pilgrimage.|$|E
25|$|The pope is {{the bishop}} of Rome, but nowhere is it written that he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> there (in fact, only 200 years prior, {{cardinals}} would have been required to reside in Rome). Political instability in thirteenth-century Italy forced the papal court to move to several different locations. Destinations included Viterbo, Orvieto, and Perugia. The popes brought the Roman Curia with them, and the College of Cardinals met {{in the city where}} the last pope had died to hold papal elections. Host cities enjoyed a boost to their prestige and certain economic advantages, but the municipal authorities risked being subsumed into the administration of the Papal States if they allowed the pope to overstay his welcome.|$|E
25|$|A Bristol Type 170 Freighter Mk. 11A {{played a}} major role in the 1957 British film The Man in the Sky {{directed}} by Charles Crichton and starring Jack Hawkins who played a test pilot. A major sequence of the film featured Hawkins testing a Bristol Type 170 when one of the engines catches fire and he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> aloft long enough to use up enough fuel in order to make an emergency landing with one engine and one wheel. The film was distributed in the U.S. under the title Decision Against Time. The Bristol Freighter that starred in the film, G-AIFV, was damaged in a crash during filming. After repairs it returned to service with Silver City Airways until it was retired and scrapped in 1962.|$|E

25|$|The 500 {{square meter}} {{facility}} of ABS-CBN Film Archives {{is covered with}} insulated walls. It has two film vaults: the medium-term vault and the long-term vault. The medium term vault holds betacam tapes, U-matic, 16mm negatives and prints, and some 35mm negatives and prints while the long-term vault holds the 35mm negatives and master prints. The facility is protected by a special fire suppression system. Acclimatization rooms are located between the vaults and the exit. Before a film could be taken out from the vault, it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in the first acclimatization room for 24 hours {{and in the second}} acclimatization room for another 24 hours to prevent damage caused by condensation due to rapid temperature change. The temperature in the long-term vault is maintained between 8 and 10°C with 31 to 35 percent relative humidity while in the medium-term vault, the temperature is maintained between 15 and 20°C with 35 to 50 percent relative humidity. The air-conditioning system of the facility operates 24 hours a day. The facility is accessible to visitors for academic and research purposes.|$|E
25|$|Richard and Susan's Mexican nanny, Amelia (Adriana Barraza), {{tends to}} their {{children}}, Debbie (Elle Fanning) and Mike (Nathan Gamble), in their San Diego, California home {{while they are}} in Morocco. When Amelia learns of Susan's injury, she is forced {{to take care of}} the children longer than planned and becomes worried that she will miss her son's wedding. Unable to secure any other help to care for them, she calls Richard for advice, who tells her that she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with the children. Without his permission, Amelia decides to take the children with her to the wedding in a rural community near Tijuana, Mexico. Her nephew Santiago (Gael García Bernal) offers to take her and the kids to the wedding. They cross the border uneventfully and the children are soon confronted by the Mexican culture and street scene. The revelry of the wedding extends well into the evening, and the kids enjoy themselves in the festivities. Rather than staying the night in Mexico with the children, Amelia decides to drive back to the States with Santiago. He has been drinking heavily and the border guards become suspicious of him and the American children in the car. Amelia has passports for all four travelers, but no letter of consent from the children's parents allowing her to take them out of the United States. Intoxicated and worried, Santiago trespasses the border. He soon abandons Amelia and the children in the desert, attempting to lead off the police; his fate after this is unknown.|$|E

500|$|... "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Antonina Armato and Tim James, {{who also}} {{produced}} the track. According to Cyrus, the track's moral is to free yourself from any biding or hindrance, in particular application to women. Cyrus said the song's message applies to different situations. Personally to her, [...] "it is {{about being a}} cage and people looking at you." [...] As for others, she believed it could describe high school, {{in a situation where}} [...] "someone feeling they have to be one way to be with a clique {{and they want to be}} who they are. A relationship, or whatever, it is just breaking out and feeling free." [...] Hollywood Records described [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] as [...] "a self-empowering song in which Miley asserts that she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> true to herself in relationships".|$|E
500|$|A player using {{a second}} {{controller}} {{can join the}} game {{at any time in}} the form of a white-furred version of Crash known as [...] "Carbon Crash".

However, the second player <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in the backpack if the first player is in mid-air or climbing a wall. This method of play is useful for overpowering enemies and collecting Mojo faster. [...] There are two modes of co-op play; in [...] "Leapfrog Mode", the players swap control each time the front player jumps, swings, or slides, while in [...] "Piggyback Mode", each player is equipped with their own backpack and can hide in the other player's backpack if the action becomes too intense, such as when jumping over a chasm.|$|E

[...] Quarshie deemed the episode the greatest work he had done for Holby City, and [...] "one of the best episodes written", expressing his pride for it, and commending the BBC for the season of Africa-related programmes. Potter felt [...] "honoured" [...] {{to be part of the}} episode, deeming it a [...] "privilege" [...] to work on. She was concerned about her ability to work in the 120°F Ghanaian heat, which she described as [...] "like walking into an oven", but through the work of the series' make-up artists, was made to seem temperate on screen.|$|E

500|$|Serbian writer Janko Veselinović {{was well}} acquainted with the {{folklore}} of Tamnava, where {{he worked as a}} teacher in a village.

He runs so fast that no biped can overtake him. After he passes the cloud, he comes back naked and blue as indigo. Then he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in bed for a week.

500|$|... "A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again" [...] is the 19th {{episode of}} the 23rd season of the American {{animated}} television sitcom The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 29, 2012. In the episode, the Simpson family goes on cruise after being convinced by a bored Bart. He enjoys himself on the vacation until Rowan Priddis, {{the director of the}} cruise, performs a song called [...] "Enjoy It While You Can" [...] that makes him realize the cruise is soon to be over and he has to return to his boring life. Bart decides to trick the crew and the passengers on the ship that the world {{is coming to an end}} back on land because of a pandemic and that the ship therefore <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> out at sea. He manages to do this with the help of a large television screen, on which he displays a scene from the film The Pandora Strain that features a general officer named William Sullivan warning humanity about a deadly virus.|$|E

After they leave, Bart decides to throw a party and invites his friends. They make a mess in the house and when Homer and Marge return home, Bart realizes he is in deep trouble. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post thought the video was not [...] "nearly as clever as the cartoon" [...] and that it had [...] "'promotional gimmick' written all over it." [...] "Then again, I never thought the video of the dance rap 'Do the Bartman' would be a ratings hit when it aired in December. So what do I know?", she added.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to small-scale, hand-to-hand combat, the characters sometimes fight from within their respective giant robots, called gears. In gear combat, the limiting factor of AP {{is replaced by}} fuel, with each attack consuming an amount corresponding to its power. For these battles, [...] "deathblows" [...] may only be executed after first building up the [...] "Attack Level"—an abstract concept represented by a number in the bottom-left of the gear combat interface—through the execution of simple strong, moderate, or weak attacks. One deathblow is allowed per point on the Attack Level gauge. There are three levels for normal gear deathblows and, beyond the third level, an [...] "infinite" [...] level with {{its own set of}} deathblows. To reach [...] "Infinity Mode", a character <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> at attack level 3 while performing any other action. With each turn, there is a chance that Infinity Mode will be reached. Having a duration of three turns, Infinity Mode allows fuel to be recharged in much larger quantities and, while in this mode, gears have access to [...] "Infinity" [...] attacks.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the hard}} work by Anthem, the {{producers}} made [...] "Kush" [...] and [...] "Requiem" [...] into bottle episodes, to give the visual effects team a break. Instead, other forms of special effects were used. To create the Himalayan feel of [...] "Kush", the production crew used wind machines and paper snow. However, the fake snow became {{a problem for the}} cast, as they suffered from bloodshot eyes and scratchy throats when exposed to it. Aquariums were placed outside each port hole of the set in [...] "Requiem". To complete the effects where Druitt teleports, Heyerdahl would walk out of the shot while every other cast member <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> still, until the directors signal them to react; the shot of Heyerdahl walking out of frame would later be cut. Another effect involving Heyerdahl is a scene between both his characters, Bigfoot and Druitt, in [...] "Revelations". To complete the shot, Heyerdahl had to film two different shots: one with him as Druitt talking to nothing, and another with him as Bigfoot talking to nothing. When both characters can be seen walking together, a stand-in would replace Heyerdahl as Bigfoot.|$|E
