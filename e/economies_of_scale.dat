5|$|Birmingham's {{explosive}} {{industrial expansion}} started earlier {{than that of}} the textile-manufacturing towns of the North of England, and was driven by different factors. Instead of the <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> of a low-paid, unskilled workforce producing a single bulk commodity such as cotton or wool in large, mechanised units of production, Birmingham's industrial development was built on the adaptability and creativity of a highly paid workforce with a strong division of labour, practising a broad variety of skilled specialist trades and producing a constantly diversifying range of products, in a highly entrepreneurial economy of small, often self-owned workshops. This led to exceptional levels of inventiveness: between 1760 and 1850 – the core years of the Industrial Revolution – Birmingham residents registered over three times as many patents as those of any other British town or city.|$|E

5|$|Before World War II, the {{international}} shipping demand for bulk products was low—about 25million tons for metal ores—and {{most of this}} trade was coastal. However, on the Great Lakes, bulkers hauled vast amounts of ore from the northern mines to the steel mills. In 1929, 73 million tons of iron ore was transported on the Lakes, and an almost equal amount of coal, limestone, and other products were also moved. Two defining characteristics of bulkers were already emerging: the double bottom, which was adopted in 1890, and the triangular structure of the ballast tanks, which was introduced in 1905. After World War II, an international bulk trade began to develop among industrialized nations, particularly between the European countries, the United States and Japan. Due to the economics of this trade, ocean bulkers became larger and more specialized. In this period, Great Lakes freighters increased in size, to maximize <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale,</b> and self-unloaders became more common to cut turnaround time. The thousand-footers of the Great Lakes fleets, built in the 1970s, were among the longest ships afloat and in 1979, a record 214 million ton of bulk cargo were moved on the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Electrical {{power is}} usually {{generated}} by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or {{from other sources}} such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric {{power in the world}} using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention {{in the late nineteenth century}} of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale,</b> and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{electrical}} plant {{construction and}} well drilling cost about €2–5million perMW of electrical capacity, while the break–even price is 0.04–0.10€ perkW·h. Enhanced geothermal systems {{tend to be}} on the high side of these ranges, with capital costs above $4million perMW and break–even above $0.054 perkW·h in 2007. Direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures, so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible. Residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10kilowatt (kW) are routinely installed for around $1–3,000 perkilowatt. District heating systems may benefit from <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs. The capital cost of one such district heating system in Bavaria was estimated at somewhat over 1million€ perMW. Direct systems of any size are much simpler than electric generators and have lower maintenance costs perkW·h, but they must consume electricity to run pumps and compressors. Some governments subsidize geothermal projects.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1946, Renault {{abandoned}} the production of heavy trucks in view of its financial troubles, and the company lost the position of France's market leader which it had before World War II. However, the rapid development and production concentration on that sector made Renault to seek ways {{to enter into the}} market. In 1950, the Renault's technical chief, Fernand Picard, elaborated a plan to launch a limited range of trucks and buses with a single 105 CV engine, taking advantage of the <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale,</b> which proved unsuccessful. In 1953, the strategy was changed and Renault decided to acquire rival manufacturers, starting with Somua and Latil. The company Saviem was formed in October 1955 by the merger of Renault's trucks and buses manufacturing operations with Somua and Latil and both Schneider (owner of Somua) and the Blum family (owner of Latil) had stakes in the new company. Initially, the Saviem name was added besides the existing badges of the three forming companies but, from 1957 onwards, Saviem-LRS appeared as marque's name on the company's products (the acronym representing the former marques Latil, Renault and Somua), which was simplified to Saviem in 1960. In 1959, Saviem became a whole-owned subsidiary of Renault. The early range of the company consisted of small commercial vehicles derived of Renault's existing models (Goélette and Galion), new medium and heavy trucks with Alfa Romeo engines and Chausson support for the coach/bus production. With an aggressive market approach focussed in volume rather than quality, Saviem became the leader by sales in France.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis article {{argues that}} we are in a {{transition}} from an <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> to an <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> choice. It presents the historical context of how design relates to the <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale,</b> and why underlying forces <b>of</b> that <b>economy</b> reduced the relevance of user experience and focused design practice on appearance. It discusses why manufacturers now meet the desire for more consumer choice through over-production. It explains how this leads to an “innovation gap” in which companies know how to make anything without knowing what to make. This article presents a model of the core capabilities of design, showing how they relate to economically viable ways of providing choice. The model involves a closer fit with emerging production processes related to platforms, the maker movement, and open innovation. In this model, such capabilities provide more exploratory and responsive ways to create innovation than a reliance on the predictive methods inherent in the <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale.</b> This leads to a “whole view” model of innovation. The model proposes a way of “sketching” innovation initiatives that involves fundamental questions: What is the offering? Who is it for? Why will it create value?
