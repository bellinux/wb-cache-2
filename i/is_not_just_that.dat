500|$|Intense media {{interest}} in the opinions and private lives {{of the royal family}} during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: [...] "Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards." [...] Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: [...] "The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of... it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not." [...] It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party – Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed [...] "the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift – membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter – to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a [...] "behind the scenes force" [...] in ending apartheid.|$|E

[...] He also translated such historical texts as The Dawn-breakers. His significance <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> of a translator, but he was also the designated and authoritative interpreter of the Bahá'í writings.

2500|$|Released {{in major}} cities as a {{roadshow}} presentation complete with intermission, {{at a time when}} the popularity of movie musicals was on the wane, the film was dismissed as inconsequential by many critics, who found Astaire's obviously frail and aged appearance shocking and Steele's manic performance annoying. In the New York Times, Renata Adler described it as a [...] "cheesy, joyless thing" [...] and added, [...] "there is something awfully depressing about seeing Finian's Rainbow... with Fred Astaire looking ancient, far beyond his years, collapsed and red-eyed... it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> the musical is dated... it is that it has been done listlessly and even tastelessly." ...|$|E

It's hard not {{to wonder if the}} filmmakers have some kind of subconscious agenda....They have made a film that will have the effect of inoculating audiences against the unique historical horror of Oradour—and implicitly rehabilitating the Nazis while making the British seem as evil as history's worst monsters....So it's no wonder that the British press sees this film as a kind of blood libel against the British people." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1986 Richie Hayward, Paul Barrere and Bill Payne {{were invited}} to play on Blue Slipper, the 1987 debut album by Helen Watson. They {{subsequently}} appeared on her second album The Weather Inside. The surviving former members of Little Feat then reformed in 1987 when Barrere, Clayton, Gradney, Hayward and Payne added songwriter/vocalist/guitarist Craig Fuller, formerly from the band Pure Prairie League, and Fred Tackett on guitar, mandolin and trumpet. The band admired Fuller's previous work and were impressed when he toured with them in 1978 {{as part of the}} Fuller/Kaz band. They didn't require an audition, having played with him on tour, and thus, the new Little Feat lineup was formed. The initial release by the new lineup, Let It Roll, was a tremendous success and Fuller's presence proved to be a major factor. His strong vocals and songwriting abilities were showcased, co-writing 8 of the 10 songs and handling a large share of lead vocals. The first single, [...] "Hate to Lose Your Lovin'", earned the band their first No.1 hit on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. All Music Guide critic Stephen Erlewine stated [...] " [...] What's surprising about Let It Roll <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> it works, but that it works smashingly." [...] The LP garnered Feat a certified gold record status on February 14, 1989. On the heels of this success, previous Feat releases experienced a sudden surge in sales. The February 10, 1978 live release Waiting for Columbus went certified platinum on November 8, 1989. Dixie Chicken, originally released on January 25, 1973, went certified gold also on November 8, 1989. The band received more exposure than ever, including an appearance on Saturday Night Live. [...] Concerts were booked nationally and Little Feat played enthusiastic, sold-out shows. [...] Barrere, Payne and company were pleased by the audience reaction; not only were they able to put over the Feat classics, but the new music proved to be artistically and commercially successful. While some Little Feat diehards initially had difficulty accepting the band without Lowell George, the success of Little Feat with Fuller could not be disputed. The band made a comeback that introduced a whole new generation to Little Feat and reignited their past, even though their original creative genius (George) was no longer around.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Flickering Myth critiqued that [...] "Some stories just don’t need telling, and Leatherface {{is one of}} them. It's not that it retcons elements of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre mythology, or that it's a 'pointless prequel' – it's just an empty movie. You'll have forgotten you've seen {{it as soon as}} the credits roll. Prequels, sequels and remakes can all enrich a story and tell it from a new perspective, but Leatherface just doesn’t do that."Screen International called the film [...] "a production line effort with an eye on cashflow rather than the demented work of art Hooper loosed on the world", stating [...] "this eighth entry is above average for its attenuated series. Gore levels are as high as expected and, naturally, the finale leaves things open for further installments." [...] Regarding the film's viewer appeal, HeyUGuys theorised, [...] "Not only is this prequel attempting to deliver something fans of the series don't necessarily want, it doesn't really do what it promises particularly well either. One for completists for sure, but on the whole Leatherface is too detached for TCM fans, and too extreme for the wider public." [...] William Bibbiani of IGN ranked it as the worst Texas Chainsaw Massacre film because [...] "it adds nothing new or interesting to the series. The problem <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> this film is a prequel, so we know exactly where it’s going, but that the road to the inevitable takes us through almost unbearably familiar territory. It honestly looks as though the filmmakers who made Leatherface didn't watch the original films, but watched all of the films that ripped off The Texas Chain Saw Massacre instead." [...] Film critic Rob Gonsalves reviewed that [...] "Hooper's Chainsaw is often imitated, never duplicated (or bested, say I), a sui generis sweatbox odyssey that seems to owe nothing to any other film before it. Leatherface feels properly respectful, made by filmmakers who idolize the original, and that’s also its weakness: it's a jumped-up fan film, and because it's meant to be a prequel to Hooper's movie it's locked into whatever happens in that movie. It can't deviate from what we know, and can't truly surprise us." [...] Heather Wixson of Daily Dead went into Leatherface [...] "primed to love it", but felt that the final product [...] "never quite makes up its mind about just what kind of movie it wants to be, and suffers for its indecision. But as a whole, Leatherface is such a disappointing entry because it spends so much time trying to be so many other things than just a straight-up Texas Chainsaw movie, and I couldn't help but wonder why." [...] Wixson commended the cinematography, practical effects, and Lili Taylor's acting, but slammed the third act.|$|E
