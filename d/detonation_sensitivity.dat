Good agreement is {{found between the}} experiment data and predictions based on the chemical length scales obtained from a detailed chemical kinetic model. To assess the <b>detonation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in methanol–oxygen mixtures, the results are {{compared with those of}} hydrogen–oxygen and methane–oxygen mixtures. Based on the cell size comparison, it is shown that methanol–oxygen is more detonation sensitive than methane–oxygen but less sensitive than hydrogen–oxygen...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} of the detonation of gas-phase mixtures of n-hexane and JP- 4, with oxidizers {{as varied as}} air and pure oxygen, measuring detonation velocities and cell sizes {{as a function of}} stoichiometry and diluent concentration. The induction length of a one-dimensional Zeldovich-von Neumann-Doering detonation was calculated {{on the basis of a}} theoretical model that employed the reaction kinetics of the hydrocarbon fuels used. Critical energy and critical tube diameter are compared for a relative measure of the heavy hydrocarbon fuels studied; <b>detonation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> appears to increase slightly with increasing carbon number...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was set up}} to investigate the transmission of a detonation wave from the smooth section of a tube into an orifice plate filled section. The critical orifice plate diameter required for successful transmission was measured for different stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures. It was shown that the critical orifice plate diameter as a measure of a fuel’s <b>detonation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is consistent with the critical tube diameter. The advantage of the critical orifice plate diameter is in the reduced experiment scale. The experimental results demonstrated that the detonation propagation and the DDT limits are strongly affected by the orifice plate BR...|$|E
40|$|This project {{consists}} of (1) essentially routine experimentation, including evaluation of <b>detonation</b> velocity, gap <b>sensitivity</b> testing, and drop weight-impact machine testing; and (2) an experimental program whose goal {{is the development}} of high precision one and two-dimensional hydrodynamic data for use in establishing empirical detonation product equations of state...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical stimuli in {{energetic}} materials initiate chemical reactions at shock fronts prior to <b>detonation.</b> Shock <b>sensitivity</b> measurements provide widely varying results, and quantum-mechanical calculations {{are unable to}} handle systems large enough to describe shock structure. Recent developments in reactive force-field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-MD) combined with advances in parallel computing have paved the way to accurately simulate reaction pathways along with the structure of shock fronts. Our multimillion-atom ReaxFF-MD simulations of l, 3, 5 -trinitro-l, 3, 5 -triazine (RDX) reveal that detonation is preceded by a transition from a diffuse shock front with well-ordered molecular dipoles behind it to a disordered dipole distribution behind a sharp front...|$|R

This is the first attempt in this work to study a composite explosive with the wedge test. Behavior appears to be quite different from the standard explosives...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} cool flame partial {{oxidation}} on the <b>detonation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of a hydrocarbon fuel was investigated experimentally. The <b>detonation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was quantified {{by measuring the}} run-up distance required for a deflagration to transit to a detonation wave (DDT) in a rough tube. Fuel rich pentane-oxygen mixtures at subatmospheric initial pressures were studied. Subsequent to the injection of the mixture into the heated detonation tube, the mixture underwent cool flame oxidation after a well controlled delay time, as it {{was determined by the}} temperature of the tube. Typical delays ranged from 0. 7 to 2 seconds (depending on temperature) and were reproducible to within one hundred milliseconds. This permitted to spark-ignite the mixture in the detonation tube at various stages of its cool flame process. The results show that increasing mixture temperature from room temperature to values below the cool flame region (below 250 °C) resulted in an increase in run-up distance. However, as the mixture begins to undergo cool flame oxidization a significant reduction in the run-up distance was obtained (as large as 50 %). The sensitization effect was found to occur only at the initial stage of the cool flame oxidation reaction. If the mixture is ignited at times long after the onset of cool flame, the mixture was found to be desensitized and the run-up distance increased. The sensitizing effect of the cool flame partial oxidation may be attributed to the presence of peroxides and free radicals associated with the initial cool flame process. However these radical species are consumed as the cool flame reaction proceeds and the mixture becomes insensitive again...|$|E
40|$|The role of binder {{deformation}} and {{the associated}} energy dissipation on the <b>detonation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of plastically bonded explosives is considered by accounting for dilatation-sensitive viscoelastic shear response. Following the observation that pressurization can prolong the relaxation and retardation times of a viscoelastic elastomer tremendously, {{the implications of this}} phenomenon are considered for a thin layer of a model elastomer, sheared between two blocks of octahydro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetranitro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetrazocine under deformation rates typical in detonation scenarios. The consequences of concurrent pressurization on heat generation are examined using small deformation as well as finite deformation analyses. While a dilatation-insensitive viscoelastic behavior generates notable temperature increases, they are insufficient to cause ignition of the explosive. However, taking into account the increased dissipation associated with the pressure-induced changes in the intrinsic time scale and viscosity of the elastomer leads to temperature rises on the order of 1000 degreesC, which are consistent with "hot spots" held responsible for the initiation of detonation in the adjacent explosive grains...|$|E
40|$|Fast burning rocket {{propellants}} {{based on}} ammonium perchlorate (AP) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) binders have been formulated and basically characterized in aluminized and non aluminized versions. The thermodynamic performance of PDMS bound propellants {{is limited by}} the evaporation point of silicon dioxide (crystobalite at 2863 K), which is formed during the combustion. The maximum specific impulses calculated with an expansion ratio of 70 : 1 are I-SP = 2340 N s/kg (238 s) for AP/PDMS and Isp = 2430 N s/kg (247 s) for AP/Al/PDMS formulations. With a tri-modal AP-fraction of 200 mum, 30 mum and 2 mum it was possible to achieve processable propellants with 83 % and 84 % solid loading. They give burning rates close to 60 mm/s at 10 MPa and pressure exponents between 0. 5 and 0. 6 in the range of 7 - 25 MPa. The thermodynamic specific impulse of these systems was calculated to I-SP = 2319 N s/kg (236 s) for AP/PDMS and I-SP = 2403 N s/kg (245 s) for AP/Al/PDMS formulations at 70 : 1 expansion ratio. Measurements of the glass transition point by DMA and TMA detected a time dependent partial crystallization of the used PDMS close to T-G in the temperature range from - 44 degreesC to - 60 degreesC. Basic tests reveal high thermal and chemical stability with flash points over 300 degreesC and zero <b>detonation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> at 50 mm diameter. The property profile, so far determined, tends to fulfil the demands for applications as propellants with high burning rates and operating pressures together with a high thermal stability and a low vulnerability...|$|E

In terms of transmitted pressure, its sensitivity is comparable to that of LX- 09 - 0. An exponential model was studied as a possible substitute for polynomials in fitting cylinder test data...|$|R
40|$|Thermochemical {{calculations}} of seven metallized monopropellants {{were conducted to}} quantify theoretical specific impulse and density specific impulse performance. On the basis of theoretical performance, commercial availability of formulation constituents, and anticipated viscometric behavior, two metallized monopropellants were selected for formulation characterization: triethylene glycol dinitrate, ammonium perchlorate, aluminum and hydrogen peroxide, aluminum. Formulation goals were established, and monopropellant formulation compatibility and hazard sensitivity were experimentally determined. These experimental {{results indicate that the}} friction <b>sensitivity,</b> <b>detonation</b> susceptibility, and material handling difficulties of the elevated monopropellant formulations and their constituents pose formidable barriers to their future application as metallized monopropellants...|$|R

40|$|Studies were {{performed}} {{in order to}} characterize the thrust augmentation potential of an ejector in a Pulse Detonation Engine application. A 49 -mm diameter tube of 0. 914 -m length was constructed with one open end and one closed end. Ethylene, oxygen, and nitrogen were introduced into the tube at the closed end through {{the implementation of a}} fast mixing injector. The tube was completely filled with a stoichiometric mixture containing a one to one molar ratio of nitrogen to oxygen. Ethylene was selected as the fuel due to its <b>detonation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and the molar ratio of the oxidizer was chosen for heat transfer purposes. Detonations were initiated in the tube {{through the use of a}} spark ignition system. The PDE was operated in a multi-cycle mode at frequencies ranging from 20 -Hz to 50 -Hz. Baseline thrust measurements with no ejector present {{were performed}} while operating the engine at various frequencies and compared to theoretical estimates. The baseline values were observed to agree with the theoretical model at low operating frequencies and proved to be increasingly lower than the predicted values as the operating frequency was increased. The baseline thrust measurements were observed to agree within 15 percent of the model for all operating frequencies. A straight 152 -mm diameter ejector was installed and thrust augmentation percentages were measured. The length of the ejector was varied while the overlap percentage (percent of the ejector length which overlapped the tube) was maintained at 25 percent for all tests. In addition, the effect of ejector inlet geometry was investigated by comparing results with a straight inlet to those of a 38 -mm inlet diameter. The thrust augmentation of the straight inlet ejector proved to be independent of engine operating frequency, augmenting thrust by 40 percent for the 0. 914 -m length ejector. In contrast, the rounded lip ejector of the same length seemed to be highly dependent on the engine operating frequency. An optimum operating frequency observed with the rounded inlet occurred at an operating frequency of 30 -Hz, resulting in thrust augmentation percentages greater than 100 percent. The effect that the engine operating frequency had on thrust augmentation levels attained with an ejector was characterized and optimum performance parameters were established. Insight into the frequency dependent nature of the ejector performance was pursued. Suggestions for future experiments which are needed to fully understand the means in which thrust augmentation is achieved in a PDE-ejector configuration were noted...|$|E
40|$|Munition {{development}} {{has always been}} driven by the necessity of delivering enough explosives to a targeted object to destroy it. Targets that are protected by steel reinforced concrete housings have become increasingly more difficult to destroy. Improvements must be made in munitions engineering design to either deliver more payload to the target or to make the weapon more potent. In most cases, due to aircraft weight limitations, the delivery of more payload is not an option. Therefore, improving the destructive power of a weapon of a given payload {{requires the use of}} more powerful explosives. However, when the potency of an explosive is increased, its sensitivity to premature detonation also increases. The characteristics of the metal casing containing the explosive contribute significantly to the weapon's <b>detonation</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Casing experience significant heating during weapon penetration. This heating can cause the weapon to detonate before it reaches its target location. In the past, computer codes used to model detonating weapons have not taken heating into account in their performance predictions. Consequently, the theoretical models and the actual field tests are not in agreement. New models, that include temperature information, are currently being developed which are based on work done in the area of computational fluid dynamics. In this research, a remotely located, high-speed, infrared (IR) camera is used to obtain detailed measurements of the passive radiation from an object in an energetic environment. This radiation information is used to determine both the emissivity and the temperature of the surface of an object. However, before the temperature or emissivity was determined, the functional form of the emissivity was calculated to be an Mth degree polynomial with respect to wavelength dependence. With the advent of large, high-speed, IR detector arrays, it has now become possible to realize IR imaging spectrometers that have very high spatial resolution. The IR spectrometer system developed in this research utilized a large detector array to allow multiple spectral images to be formed simultaneously on the image plane. In conjunction with the correct emissivity model, this imaging IR spectrometer can determine temperature to within ± 5 degrees Celsius. These experimentally verified temperature maps were then integrated into the newly developed computer models. This additional information will result in more accurate computer codes for modeling the energetic environment. In turn, this will allow the weapon designer to accurately optimize weapon performance with respect to different materials, geometries and kinetics...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the formulation and characterisation of emulsion explosives. This included the manufacture of more than 120 kg of emulsion explosive of which around 105 kg was used on the explosive ordnance range in over 350 individual firings. For each emulsion composition, an average of eight firings was undertaken with which to substantiate the explosive performance data. The formulation was varied {{to determine the effects}} of water content upon the physical characteristics of the emulsion. These physical effects included thermal conductivity, particle size, viscosity and the explosive performance of the emulsion. In respect of explosive performance, microballoons were added to sensitise the emulsion and the proportions of microballoons added were altered to look at their effect on velocity of <b>detonation,</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and the brisance of the emulsions. Emulsion explosives are commonly referred, in literature, as Type 11 non-ideal explosives. This is due to their non-linear behaviour with respect to the variation of velocity of detonation with density. Traditionally, when an emulsion explosive was commercially manufactured, the water content has been kept at a minimum (12 - 17 %). This was accepted as the way to achieve the best explosive performance, based upon the belief that an emulsion with the highest concentration of active ingredients, ammonium nitrate and oil, would give the best explosive performance. This study examined a wider range of emulsion explosive water contents than has been previously studied, from 12 % to 35 % water. It was found, during this study, that higher water content emulsions, specifically 25 % water, had a marked increase in explosive performance. The highest velocity of detonation recorded was in a 39 mm diameter tube, at 25 % water content with 3 % microballoons, was 5558 ms- 1. This was some 15 % higher than any other VOD recorded in this study. The high velocity of detonation, at 25 % water content, was one of a number of physical characteristics in which this water content varied from the other emulsion water contents. This study endeavored to show that emulsion explosives could exhibit two differing types of explosive reaction, thermal explosion and grain burning. This was based on the velocity of detonation and plate dent data, both of which indicated that there was a change in reaction with water content. Emulsion explosives, with a high water and high microballoon content, exhibited a thermal explosion type reaction. They exhibited Type I ideal explosive behaviour, with increasing velocity of detonation with density. Lower water content emulsion explosives, displayed the more commonly expected Type 11 non-ideal behaviour and reacted in a grain burning type detonation.

40|$|Abstract. Effects of {{addition}} of boron (B) particles on performances of RDX-based plastic bonded explosives (PBX) {{have been evaluated}} with regard to prevention against Neumann effect from simulated devices for high explosive anti tank warheads, through measurements of penetration lengths during steel plate penetration tests for PBX samples with various B contents of up to 10 wt%. <b>Detonation</b> velocities, <b>sensitivities</b> against heat and impact, and mechanical properties have also been examined for PBX samples tested: detonation velocities were measured by using a high-speed photographic method; sensitivity against heat was evaluated through Krupp ignition temperature test; sensitivity against impact was evaluated through 5 kg-drop hammer test; and tensile and compression stresses have been measured with regard to mechanical properties. Although there were only slight changes in detonation velocities and in suppression abilities in steel plate penetration lengths when up to 5 wt % B particles were added, improvements have been observed in both aspects, when weight content of B particles increased by up to 10 wt%, even though PBX samples were observed to become more sensitive against heat and impact; and experimental values for tensile and compression stresses of PBX samples have also increased {{with the increase in}} weight content of B particles...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the leading}} {{explosion}} scenarios for Type Ia supernovae involve the nuclear incineration of a white dwarf star through a detonation wave. Several scenarios have been proposed as to how this detonation may actually occur, but the exact mechanism and environment in which it takes place remain unknown. We explore the effects of an off-center initiated detonation on the spatial distribution of the nucleosynthetic yield products in a toy model [...] a pre-expanded near Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. We find that a single-point near edge-lit detonation results in asymmetries in the density and thermal profiles, notably the expansion timescale, throughout the supernova ejecta. We demonstrate that this asymmetry of the thermodynamic trajectories should be common to off-center detonations where {{a small amount of}} the star is burned prior to <b>detonation.</b> The <b>sensitivity</b> of the yields on the expansion timescale results in an asymmetric distribution of the elements synthesized as reaction products. We tabulate the shift in the center of mass of the various elements produced in our model supernova and find an odd-even pattern for elements past silicon. Our calculations show that off-center single-point detonations in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are marked by significant composition asymmetries in their remnants which bear potentially observable signatures in both velocity and coordinate space, including an elemental nickel mass fraction which varies by a factor of two to three {{from one side of the}} remnant to the other.

40|$|TEX is a {{recently}} synthesized explosive that may comply {{to the very}} strict property requirements needed for a commercial or military explosive. As an explosive, TEX is notable for its very high density. Having a measured crystal density of 1. 99, TEX {{has one of the}} highest known densities of all CHNO based explosives. This high density is due to its isowurtzitane structure having a close-packed crystal lattice, with the nitro groups occupying the free space between the cages[1]. TEX is very energetic, combining a high velocity of <b>detonation</b> with low <b>sensitivity</b> to mechanical stimuli and good thermal stability. The seven-membered rings of the isowurtzitane structure put a strain on the cage and thus increase the energy content of the molecule. A part of the explosive power of TEX is derived from this cage strain[1]. The insensitive nature of TEX suggests that it may be a suitable high performance alternative to such explosives as TATB and NTO, thus giving RDX class performance to insensitive compositions[3]. Comparative performance figures for these explosives is shown in Table 1. The original synthesis of TEX reported by Joseph Boyer and colleagues[5] involve...|$|R
