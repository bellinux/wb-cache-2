40|$|One food retail {{concept is}} missing among the food retail offerings in Malaysia in 2011 : the <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> grocer, a chain store format. At 300 - 1, 000 square metres floor area, a typical <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> food store in Europe offers a limited {{assortment}} of 600 - 2, 000, typically own brands / labels. This is {{a fraction of}} both space and assortment {{as compared to the}} typical hypermarket and supermarket in Malaysia. Nevertheless, the <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> concept has been achieving above average food retail industry growth in Europe and USA in the past ten years. Being the antithesis to the hypermarket, the <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> concept has become a voracious competitor to supermarkets and small neighbourhood shops. The <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> stores locate in residential and densely populated neighbourhoods, potentially serving local community needs for proximity shopping. According to ACNielsen (2007), hard discount’s price across categories is lower by 30 - 40 per cent on average; the quality of the own brands is typically good. Food shoppers in Malaysia, being among the most price conscious shoppers in Asia (ACNielsen, 2002) might - or might not - be attracted by the <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> offer were the concept to appear in Malaysia in the future. However, retail on < 2, 000 square metres floor space is currently reserved for Malaysian retailers by regulation. Therefore, <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> food retail needs reinventing in Malaysia by Malaysians - or consumers and local communities will be deprived of the experience. The regulation bars Foreign Direct Investment and, effectively, the entry of foreign, experienced chains into the <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> food segment. This essay contributes a philosophical discussion of the absence of <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> grocery in the retail modernisation of Malaysia and makes comparisons with mature food discount markets Denmark and Germany. The discussion is based on synthesis of secondary data, observations by the researcher, and interviews. The essay will be suggesting that a future successful <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> food launch in Malaysia could potentially change food- and some non-food retail in Malaysia and perhaps as dramatically as the hypermarket did beginning in the mid 1990 s...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis article {{concerns}} the spatial organization of a retail network. During {{the expansion of}} a retail network, the location decision process does not necessarily lead to a regular distribution of outlets throughout the territory. The case of 5 <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> store networks in France in their development stage illustrates this situation. A <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> network strategy to fight against incumbent stores relies on the postulate that its competitiveness stems from its perfect cost control, and consequently, its ability to impose its brands to the consumers. To explain hard discounter spatial strategies, the diffusion theory was primarily developed by retaining only the temporal dimension of the process. But this model is not well established for the disordered {{environment in which the}} networks are managed. The percolation theory facilitates a new approach of the diffusion in this disordered medium that represents the retail network...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe French Observatory of Food Quality (Oqali) aims at {{collecting}} all nutritional {{data provided}} on labels of processed foods (nutritional information and composition), at branded products level, {{in order to}} follow nutritional labeling changes over time. This study carries out an overview of allergens labeling frequencies by distinguishing allergens used in recipes from those listed on precautionary statements, for the fourteen allergen categories for which labeling is mandatory according to European legislation. 17, 309 products were collected, between 2008 and 2012, from 26 food categories. Products were classified per family and type of brand (national brands, retailer brands, entry-level retailer brands, <b>hard</b> <b>discount,</b> and specialized retailer brands). Allergenic ingredients were identified from ingredients lists and precautionary statements. 73 % of the 17, 309 products studied contained at least one allergen in their ingredients list and 39 % had a precautionary statement for one or more allergens. Milk (53 %), gluten (41 %), and egg (22 %) were {{the most commonly used}} allergens in ingredients lists. For precautionary statement, nuts (20 %), egg (14 %), peanut (13 %), soybean (12 %), and milk (11 %) were the most common allergens listed. Precautionary statement was most frequently found among first-price products (<b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> and entry-level retailer brands). National brands seemed to use it less frequently. For all these results, differences depended both on food categories and allergen categories. This study will enable to follow allergens labeling and their use as ingredients over time, particularly by assessing an hypothetical increase in allergens presence in processed food...|$|E

It is well-established that first-time stone formers under the age of 18, those with uric acid, cystine or pure calcium phosphate stone compositions should be evaluated due to their significant risk of underlying metabolic abnormalities and the likelihood that specific medical prophylactic inter-ventions will be of value. 1 The proponents of an in-depth metabolic {{evaluation of}} all first-time calcium oxalate stone formers argue that this strategy leads to a reduction in future symptomatic stone events for these patients as well.

More frequently, seasoned gamers are demanding more physical interaction with a game than simple use of thumbs. In addition, researchers at NMSU’s Learning Games Lab are finding that such non-standard controllers, such as the Wiimotes used to play tennis or the “guitars ” used in the game Guitar Hero, encourage play by {{those who do not}} normally game, such as parents and grandparents.

40|$|Since 1990 {{the grocery}} market in Scotland has been {{restructured}} and re-organised. November 1990 saw {{the opening of}} the first Shoprite <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> grocery store in Scotland. A discount re-orientation and price war had begun. Shoprite expanded (too) rapidly, got into difficulties and have had to sell their stores to Kwik Save. Wm Low, after being adversely affected by the changed competitive structure, have been taken over by Tesco. These events illustrate the increased competitive nature of the Scottish grocery market. Both developments came as a surprise however to dedicated followers of brokers' reports on these retail companies, despite the supposedly close relationships between brokers and retail. This study looks at brokers' reports on Shoprite and Wm Low in the lead up to their take-overs in 1994, and points (admittedly with hindsight) to a divergence in investment recommendations and commercial reality...|$|E
40|$|German food {{discount}} stores {{have changed the}} European retail landscape in the 1990 s as the French hypermarkets did in the 1970 s and 1980 s. But a very limited literature does exist on that topic {{because of the lack}} of available sources. This paper tries to tell the story of this retail format in Europe and focuses on the French situation where the war between German hard discounters and French hypermarkets seem to be critical for the future of both German and French retail industry. Three theories are mobilized to explain this evolution: the wheel of retailing, the retail life cycle and the population ecology. The French retail situation is described through all the strategies implemented by local retailers to resist to the <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> invasion.

40|$|Entry {{barriers}} {{in the retail}} sector are a frequent policy regulation in some countries. We evaluate the price effects of the entry of LIDL, a German <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> supermarket chain, in the Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain) in 2010 and only after winning a long legal battle. We first make a theoretical analysis of how an incumbent reacts when entry by a new operator is announced but does not know the level of quality the entrant will offer. We also analyze the incumbent’s pricing strategy after entry has materialized and uncertainty disappears. Secondly, we use a database obtained from a special survey for {{a representative sample of}} supermarkets in Gran Canaria to estimate how incumbents reacted to entry in the products sold and not sold by LIDL. We show that {{there is some evidence that}} prices for all goods prior to entry were initially lower in supermarkets close to the future entrant compared to supermarkets further away. However, after entry incumbents’ prices for products not sold by the entrant actually rose near the entrant’s new stores, compared to a suitable control group of supermarkets farther away...|$|E
40|$|In the European food sector private labels {{represent}} a relevant and increasing share of total sales. Thus, national brands need to adapt their marketing strategies {{to deal with}} this growing competition. Focusing on price strategies, recent theoretical papers conclude that private label development should cause a decrease in the price of national brands, while some empirical studies do not support this prediction. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore this empirical relationship for the Italian food retail sector, which is of special research interest, since it has undergone a dramatic change in the last 10 years. Using retail sales data, we build time series of market shares of prices of national brands and private labels for different dairy products and we study how prices of national brands react to private label growth. We find that, for most products, the negative impact of private label development on national brand prices is confirmed, and this may be mainly due to the difficulties in implementing product differentiation strategies by national brand manufacturers. A relevant exception is the <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> channel, probably because its success is attracting an increasing number of national brands. private label, pricing, retail sector, dairy products., Consumer/Household Economics, Marketing,...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Previous {{research}} {{on the influence of}} the food environment on weight status has often used impersonal measures of the food environment defined for residential neighborhoods, which ignore whether people actually use the food outlets near their residence. To assess whether supermarkets are relevant contexts for interventions, the present study explored between-residential neighborhood and between-supermarket variations in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), and investigated associations between brands and characteristics of supermarkets and BMI or WC, after adjustment for individual and residential neighborhood characteristics. METHODS: Participants in the RECORD Cohort Study (Paris Region, France, 2007 - 2008) were surveyed on the supermarket (brand and exact location) where they conducted their food shopping. Overall, 7 131 participants shopped in 1 097 different supermarkets. Cross-classified multilevel linear models were estimated for BMI and WC. RESULTS: Just 11. 4 % of participants shopped for food primarily within their residential neighborhood. After accounting for participants' residential neighborhood, people shopping in the same supermarket had a more comparable BMI and WC than participants shopping in different supermarkets. After adjustment for individual and residential neighborhood characteristics, participants shopping in specific supermarket brands, in <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> supermarkets (especially if they had a low education), and in supermarkets whose catchment area comprised low educated residents had a higher BMI/WC. CONCLUSION: A public health strategy to reduce excess weight may be to intervene on specific supermarkets to change food purchasing behavior, as supermarkets are where dietary preferences are materialized into definite purchased foods...|$|E

40|$|For grocery {{retailers}} in Europe, {{intense competition}} from <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> formats like Lidl and Aldi is an established {{part of the}} competitive landscape. Due to the highly competitive retail environment, traditional retailers’ private label (PL) tiers are now set to become the new battle ground in this competition. This study analyzes how PL tiers (i. e. economy, standard and premium) affect the competition between discounters and traditional retailers. We use a representative UK household panel dataset (2009 - 2010) for the ready-to-eat cereal and canned soup category, and estimate a demand model for the choice between national brands (NBs) and PL tiers across the top- 7 UK retailers. Using our demand estimates, we conduct several counterfactual experiments that predict consumer responses to different strategies of traditional retailers and discounters in their fight for the consumer. In particular, we compare the effectiveness of three types of PLs offered by traditional retailers to fight discounters: economy PLs versus standard PLs versus premium PLs. We find that premium PLs are not very effective strategies for traditional retailers to fight with discounters. On the other hand, economy PLs manage to steal some market share from discounters, but as a downside they also cannibalize traditional retailers’ standard PLs. Standard PLs seem the most effective tool to fight with discounters, since they steal most market share from discounters (and NBs). From {{the point of view}} of the discounters, our results indicate that discounters benefit from a further increase in their NB offerings (assortment depth) as well as from a price cut in their own PLs. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|In our communication, we give a {{detailed}} analysis {{on the results of}} the EU accession of the Hungarian wine sector, while {{it is one of the}} significant wine producers of New Member States, and we have nearly three years experience of application of the CMO-wine. We show what was expected by the actors of the Hungarian wine industry from this accession. For this reason, we analyze deep interviews made in 2003 with several represents of the wine enterprises and the represents of the professional organizations before the entry to the EU. Then we examine the implementation of the CMO-wine at the level of the national regulation and we analyzed the available statistics (sources: KSH, HNT, MVH) in relation of the measures of the CMO-wine applied in the wine sector, and its effect on the Hungarian wine economy. After that, we study the effect of the EU accession to the Hungarian wine exchange, the wine export and import of the recent period. Finally, we touch upon the probable influence of the actual version of the CMO-wine reform on the Hungarian wine industry. Our study underlines that the operators of the Hungarian wine sector expected a foreseeable and relatively stable regulation system of wine production or wine markets and therefore they projected a rather stable subvention system. Among the CMO-wine measures, for Hungary, the primary is the restructuring and re-conversion of vineyards, but we examine the exploitation of the other CMO-measures like the distillations, the private storage, the aid for musts usage and the export refund for wine exportation into third countries. Then we analyze the tendency of wine export after the EU accession, which reduced drastically during the recent period for the reason that the concurrence is more and more intensive at the international markets and the cause for the lack of marketing investments. At the same time, the structure of wine import has changed. Its volume rests still marginal, but it shows an increasing tendency, particularly in the category of the bottled wine with favourable quality/price rate, which means a direct concurrence for the Hungarian quality wines in the super-, hypermarket and <b>hard</b> <b>discount</b> chains.
