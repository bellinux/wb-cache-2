5000|$|In her {{analysis}} of Japan's gradual path to economic success and then quick reversal, Jennifer Amyx noted that Japanese experts were not {{unaware of the}} possible causes of Japan's economic decline. Rather, to return Japan's economy back to the path to economic prosperity, policymakers {{would have had to}} adopt policies that would first cause short-term harm to the Japanese people and government. Under this analysis, says Ian Lustick, Japan was stuck on a [...] "local maximum," [...] which it arrived at through gradual increases in its fitness level, set by the economic landscape of the 1970s and 80s. Without an accompanying change in institutional flexibility, Japan was unable to adapt to changing conditions and even though experts may have known which changes needed to be made, they would have been virtually powerless to enact those changes without instituting unpopular policies which would have been harmful in the short-term. Lustick's analysis is rooted in the application of evolutionary theory and natural selection to understanding <b>institutional</b> <b>rigidity</b> in the social sciences.|$|E

Due to its large landholdings and <b>institutional</b> <b>rigidity,</b> a rigidity to which the excessively large ranks of the clergy contributed, many bishops studied law, not theology, being relegated {{to the role of}} property managers trained in administration. While priests emphasized works of religiosity, the respectability of the church began diminishing, especially among well educated urbanites, and especially considering the recent strings of political humiliation, such as the apprehension of Pope Boniface VIII by Philip IV of France, the [...] "Babylonian Captivity", the Great Schism, and the failure of Conciliar reformism. In a sense, the campaign by Pope Leo X to raise funds to rebuild St. Peter's Basilica was too much of an excess by the secular Renaissance church, prompting high-pressure indulgences that rendered the clergy establishments even more disliked in the cities.|$|E

This article interprets the debate over the increase as the consequence of <b>institutional</b> <b>rigidities</b> within German broadcasting regulation that favour the occurrence of regulatory problems in the PSB sector. The Länder are locked in nested games and, therefore, are forced to make what appears for outside observers to be sub-optimal choices.

There are also a number of studies based on micro data that could not explain the high European unemployment rates with <b>institutional</b> <b>rigidity</b> (Card et al. 1996; Krueger and Pischke 1997). At the same time, some other economists were insisting on exploring the aggregate demand deficiency and macroeconomic policies as a potential explanation for employment differences across countries (see Solow 2008; Krugman 2009; Schettkat and Sun 2009; Wolf 2014). However, this evidence appears to have been ignored, and the deregulation of welfare-state institutions remained the main policy recommendations even today in Europe.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the choices of}} mathematical approaches in economics and econometrics, in particular, approaches that either (a) aim for a sharp result or (b) use the least restrictive assumptions. It is argued that, while the choice (a) often necessitates strong mathematical assumptions, choice (b) may lead to only partial identification and may require using less familiar mathematical techniques. This is discussed {{in the context of}} the problem of defining a probability density: existence may fail in function spaces; even after imposing assumptions that ensure existence, the problem is not well posed. A density function may not exist for economic variables as a consequence of <b>institutional</b> <b>rigidity</b> such as an income supplement. The apparatus of generalized functions provides the general solution to identification and well-posedness of density, but at the cost of less sharp results and greater mathematical complexity. ...|$|E

40|$|The key to {{the growing}} {{prominence}} of prosecutors, both in the United States and elsewhere, lies in the prosecutor’s preeminent ability to bridge organizational and conceptual divides in criminal justice.

By blurring these boundaries, prosecutors provide the criminal justice system with three different kinds of flexibility—ideological, institutional, and operational—and they strengthen their own hands in a legal culture that increasingly disfavors <b>institutional</b> <b>rigidity</b> and hard-and-fast commitments. At the same time, though, the mediating role of the prosecutor frustrates traditional strategies for holding government accountable.

Juxtaposing theories of compensation that focus on human capital endowments and labor market segmentation, we hypothesize multilevel and cross-level determinants of compensation.

Results indicate that compensation is directly determined by human capital endowments of education and experience. Institutional differentials do not directly drive compensation, but instead moderate the relationship of human capital endowments to compensation. Large institutions pay more than small institutions to IT professionals with more education, while small institutions pay more than large institutions to IT professionals with less education. Not-for-profit institutions pay more than for-profits to IT professionals with more or IT-specific education. Further, information-intensive institutions pay more than non information-intensive institutions to IT professionals with more or IT-specific education.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the questions {{why and how}} federal systems exhibit different trajectories by picking up conceptual advancements which have been put forth in historical institutionalist theory. As the recent theoretical debate on political change has shown, it seems necessary {{to move beyond the}} narrow focus on path dependence in order to enhance our understanding of how history can influence present and future political developments in various forms. Two considerations seem to be particularly well suited for an analysis of federalism and change: First, the concept of frictions allows for the identification of endogenous sources of political change and can be considered as a valuable analytical alternative to the exogenous shock-argument. Second, the degree of rigidity inherent to political institutions influences how entrepreneurial agents can employ power resources in order to challenge or defend an existing historical outcome. The first parts of the paper (I and II) are dedicated {{to the development of a}} framework for the analysis of federalism and political change informed by historical institutionalism.

When comparing this classification with records {{of economic and}} political reforms before the breakdown of socialism, an apparent historical regularity emerges.

Some political economy explanations for this regularity are suggested. The second part of the paper explores Slovenia 2 ̆ 7 s experience in some detail.
