The second part deals with well-architectured fluoroelastomers. First, fluorinated thermoplastic elastomers obtained either by sequential iodine transfer polymerisation of fluoroalkenes (leading to triblock copolymers) or by a two-step procedure involving a monomer bearing peroxide that generated macroperoxides which thus produced graft copolymers.

40|$|L'accroissement des contraintes subies par les matériaux utilisés dans les {{techniques}} pétrolières et parapétrolières et liées aux températures et pressions élevées ainsi qu'aux agressions chimiques, fait que l'on exige de ces matériaux qu'ils soient de plus en plus performants. Ceci implique, pour les concepteurs et utilisateurs de matériel comportant des élastomères en contact avec les hydrocarbures, une connaissance actualisée des produits existants, lesquels sont en constante évolution. On commence donc par décrire les principales familles d'élastomères résistant en milieu pétrolier actuellement disponibles sur le marché. Puis, après avoir évoqué les problèmes que rencontrent les industries pétrolière et automobile dans l'utilisation des élastomères et présenté sommairement les résultats de travaux réalisés à l'Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP), on définira quelques axes de recherches dont la finalité est de participer à l'amélioration des techniques pétrolières dans le sens d'une meilleure fiabilité et d'une réduction des coûts. The {{materials used}} in the oil and automotive industries are being subjected to higher and higher mechanical, thermal and chemical stresses, so these materials, and especially elastomers, {{have to be more}} and more resistant. For designers and users of equipment containing elastomers in contact with hydrocarbons, this requires an updated understanding of existing products. The aim of this article is thus to describe, first of all, the leading families of resistant elastomers now available for use in a petroleum environment, with particular emphasis on chlorinated, fluorinated, acrylic and nitrile rubbers and their derivatives, which have evolved greatly in recent years with the appearance of new varieties and new types of elastomers, such as Atlas, Vamac, Eypel, etc. For each family of elastomer, the structure is described along with the vulcanization method, its properties and its uses. Then the problems with which elastomers are confronted in the petroleum industry are described. They are mainly linked to the high pressures and temperatures encoutered in boreholes and to chemical attacks due to acid gases, corrosion inhibitors and completion and treatment fluids. Elastomers must also be resistant to blistering, extrusion and abrasion. The proper choice of a material can lead to a reduction in operating costs and to increased safety. Concerted action among elastomer producers and users seems indispensable. Problems in the automotive industry are linked to the increase in thermal stresses due to the raising of the temperature underneath the hood, to the use of new fuels, unleaded gasoline oxygenated fuel, and to the evolution of lubricant additives. This is leading to the progressive forsaking of nitrile rubber and polychloroprene to the benefit of higher-performance but more expensive elastomers such as fluorinated rubbers or hydrogenated nitrile rubbers. <b>Fluorosilicones</b> and acrylics are also being called upon for development in the automotive industry. Then several research findings made at Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP) are described, concerning the comparative analysis of the behavior of nitrile, hydrogenated nitrile and fluorinated rubbers in complex petroleum environments, together with a few examples of applications in the field of pumps, composite-material tubes with an elastomeric liner and gaskets. To conclude some suggestions are made on possibilities of improving elastomers for petroleum applications, based on {{a better understanding of the}} phenomenon of blistering, an improvement of vulcanization systems and the optimizing of some elastomers such as HNBR. Progress is also possible in the behavior of elastomers with regard to lubricants and fuels and in the predicting of the lifetime of seals used in boreholes...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fluorosilicone</b> o-ring aging {{studies were}} performed. These studies {{examined}} the compressive force loss of <b>fluorosilicone</b> o-rings at accelerated (elevated) temperatures and were {{then used to}} make predictions about force loss at room temperature. The results were non-Arrhenius with evidence for a lowering in Arrhenius activation energies as the aging temperature was reduced. The compression set of these <b>fluorosilicone</b> o-rings {{was found to have}} a reasonably linear correlation with the force loss. The aging predictions based on using the observed curvature of the Arrhenius aging plots were validated by field aged o-rings that yielded degradation values reasonably close to the predictions. Compression set studies of silicone o-rings from a previous study resulted in good correlation to the force loss predictions for the <b>fluorosilicone</b> o-rings from this study. This resulted in a preliminary conclusion that an approximately linear correlation exists between compression set and force decay values for typical <b>fluorosilicone</b> and silicone materials, and that the two materials age at similar rates at low temperatures. Interestingly, because of the observed curvature of the Arrhenius plots available from longer-term, lower temperature accelerated exposures, both materials had faster force decay curves (and correspondingly faster buildup of compression set) at room temperature than anticipated from typical high-temperature exposures. A brief study on heavily filled conducting silicone o-rings resulted in data that deviated from the linear relationship, implying that a degree of caution must be exercised about any general statement relating force decay and compression set...|$|E

However, the feed and permeate compositions {{were found to be}} equal in pervaporation experiments when the water content in the feed was approximately 70 mole%. Generally, water-selectivity was enhanced by pervaporation as compared to liquid-vapor equilibrium. Composite membranes were also prepared with a thin layer of <b>fluorosilicone</b> rubber coated on top of a porous substrate polyethersulfone membrane. It was found that the performance of the composite membrane was affected by the molecular weight of polyethersulfone used to prepare the porous substrate.

One crucial aspect amongst others is to investigate the compatibility of alternative fuels with elastomeric materials currently used in gas turbine engines. However, little knowledge about this has been understood so far for commercial aircrafts under real engine conditions. This study combines Stress-Relaxation test and FTIR spectroscopy techniques {{to look at the}} effect of alternative fuels on O-rings made from different materials; such as nitrile, fluorocarbon and <b>fluorosilicone.</b> Results indicated that after immerged in fuels {{for a period of time}} while simultaneously being compressed at certain temperatures, the fluorocarbon O-rings showed minimum change in the eight types of fuels tested. This meant they are compatible with these fuels, with the nitrile O-rings changing the most. Furthermore, FT-SPK+ 20 % hexanol caused the biggest relaxation in <b>fluorosilicone</b> O-rings but had the smallest effect on nitrile ones while all fuels presented similar behavior in fluorocarbon. FTIR spectrum analysis showed molecular composition changes are dependent on the reactions between different materials and fuels. For <b>fluorosilicone</b> O-rings, the absorbance reduction from 1150 to 1050 cm- 1 was caused by the breakdown of (Si-O-Si) while the formation of new O-H bonds enhanced the intensity from 3000 to 2800 cm- 1. For fluorocarbon O-rings, obvious increase in absorption could be found in the region from 1400 to 650 cm- 1, while from 3000 to 2800 cm- 1, the absorption decreased.

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{elaborate}} {{on the effect of}} a low Earth orbit (LEO) space environment the <b>fluorosilicone</b> rubber polymers. In particular, we concentrate on the study of the influen of atomic oxygen (AO) and UV irradiation on their chemical, morphological, and mechani properties. The samples were exposed to the space environment in-flight and in a grou simulation radio frequency (RF) oxygen plasma Asher system. LEO environment was found to have a pronounced destructive effect on t <b>fluorosilicone</b> rubber. Exposure of the samples in space for 18 months (AO fluence 2. 1 × 1020 atoms/cm 2) during the POSA-II experiment resulted in cracking of their surface a changes in chemical composition, namely a decrease in the atomic concentration of fluori and an increase in the amount of oxygen by formation of silicon oxide. These changes indu stresses in the modified region and between the modified and virgin zones. The affect material is characterized by increased hardness and elastic modulus. AO fluence is a dominant factor in the sample deterioration: the specimen facing the M space station received lower AO flux (8 × 1019 atoms/cm 2) and, consequently, has less dama as compared to the specimen that faced outer space. Ground simulation of LEO environment by exposure to RF oxygen plasma produc similar effects to those of the space environment. Its impact is even stronger due to high levels of UV irradiation, albeit more concentrated in the near-surface region, as conclud from the comparison of nanoindentation measurements performed by an atomic for microscope and a conventional nanoindenter. We deduce that <b>fluorosilicone</b> rubber is not suitable for long duration utilization wh exposed to space environment due its chemical and mechanical instability. The undesir effects may include both destruction of the sealing and contamination of neighboring pa within line-of-sight with its outgassing products. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{fiscal year}} 1993, tests of an o-ring/tetraseal {{retainer}} designed {{to replace a}} gasket-type seal used in PUREX-type process jumper connectors encouraged the design of an improved seal block.

The integral seal block uses a standard o-ring nested in a groove to accomplish leak tightness. This seal block eliminates the need to machine acme threads into the lower skirt casting and seal retainers, eliminates tolerance stack-up, reduces parts inventory, and eliminates an unnecessary leak path in the jumper connector assembly.

Despite the moderately high wt% of fluorin in the polymer structure (23. 8 %), these polymers had poor fuel resistance. In fact, swelling measurements indicate that these polymers had apparent solubility parameters of about 18. 2 J (exp 1 / 2) m (exp - 3 / 2) (toluene). Copolymerization of the disilanol monomers with <b>fluorosilicone</b> monomers afforded copolymers containing 20 - 30 wt% of the perfluorocyclobutane-containing structure displayed adequate fuel resistance, enhanced thermal stability, and a Tg low enough {{to meet the requirements}} of a High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) fuel tank sealant. In the second part of this work, trifluorovinylether-terminated oligomers were prepared and polymerized via cyclodimerization. Initially, an alpha, omega-silanol-terminated <b>fluorosilicone</b> was endcapped with trifluorovinylether end groups via a two-step synthetic sequence. The oligomer was thermally cyclodimerized to a polymer that displayed thermal stability similar to that of a <b>fluorosilicone</b> homopolymer.

The pendant trifluoropropyl groups did enhance solvent resistance in aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents, however, no improvement was observed in aromatic hydrocarbon solvents. These polymers also displayed excellent thermal stability. In the last part of this work, a series of monomers was prepared by the DCC-promoted esterification of 4 -[trifluorovinyl(oxy) benzoic acid with alpha, omega-functionalized hydrogenated and partially fluorinated alcohols. The monomers were cyclodimerized to the corresponding polymers. The polymers that did not contain beta hydrogens displayed significantly higher thermal stability than the fully hydrogenated polymers. A commercially-available alpha,omega-hydroxy-terminated perfluoropolyether was then functionalized with 4 -[trifluorovinyl(oxy) benzoylchloride. An attempt was made to polymerize the resulting oligomer via the cyclodimerization of the terminal trifluorovinylether moieties.

Simultaneous chain extension and crosslinking are observed to occur when the purified monomer is heated directly and when the remaining nitrile in the monomer is allowed to react with excess ammonia to form the corresponding amidine, which is then heated.

Following an approach based on the lessons learned in {{the explosion of the}} space shuttle Challenger, investigators have been seeking O-ring materials that exhibit adequate resilience for effective sealing over a broad temperature range: What are desired are O rings that expand far and fast enough to maintain seals, even when metal sealing surfaces at a joint move slightly away from each other shortly after ignition and the motor was exposed to cold weather before ignition. Other qualities desired of the improved O rings include adequate resistance to ablation by hot rocket gases and resistance to swelling when exposed to hydrocarbon-based greases used to protect some motor components against corrosion. Five rubber formulations two based on a <b>fluorosilicone</b> polymer and three based on copolymers of epichlorohydrin with ethylene oxide were tested as candidate O-ring materials. Of these, one of the epichlorohydrin/ethylene oxide formulations was found to offer the closest to the desired combination of properties and was selected for further evaluation...|$|E

First, the "conventional" <b>fluorosilicone</b> are depicted {{and the most}} common one is poly(3, 3, 3 -trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane) (PTFPMS) commercialized nowadays by Dow Corning. Then various ways have thus been employed {{to increase the number}} of fluorine atoms in the materials. One elegant way of preparing these is to simply introduce in the silicone chain, either as a pendant group or inside the backbone, perfluorinated groups of increasing size (typically C 6 or more). Hence, "pendant silicones" are listed containing perfluorinated chains introduced as side groups of the silicone backbone whereas those bearying fluorine atoms into the main backbone are generally referred as "hybrid silicones". Additionally, polymers bearing fluorinated groups both in the main chain and as pendant groups in the class of hybrid copolymers complete that chapter. In each case, the properties of such fluoropolymers and their equivalent (crosslinked) elastomers are reviewed. Particularly, a thorough comparison of the above mentioned two classes of polymers in terms of mechanical, swelling or thermal properties is lacking, especially for the hybrid fluorosilicones. Intermediate conclusions will compare these above classes of polymers in regards with the considered property...|$|E

Different {{factors such as the}} composition of the solvents, polymer concentration, copolymer block length as well as the removal of the common solvent in the system were investigated. Besides, a classical thermodynamic model for surfactant self-assembly was applied to describe the mechanism of the formation and transition between different morphologies. It was found that the transfer free energy, the aggregate core-solvent interfacial free energy, the deformation free energy of the non-soluble block as well as the soluble block steric interactions had their specific contributions to the formation and transition of different morphologies induced from the self-assembly behavior of PDMS-b-PHFBMA. As a whole, the qualitative description of the mechanism of self-assembly and morphology transition behavior in macromolecular system can be easily achieved using the classical thermodynamic approach for surfactant self-assembly, while it still needs to be further improved.
