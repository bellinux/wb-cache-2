5|$|Cowpeas thrive <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This {{makes them}} a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert regions where not many other crops will grow. As {{well as an}} important source of food for humans <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to demonstrate that the perceived importance of wages is a function of thermal climate and national wealth. As hypothesized, analyses of 37 nationally representative samples of 22 483 blue- and white-collar workers and 5544 managers show that wages are perceived as more important <b>in</b> <b>poorer</b> countries with colder climates (e. g., Azerbaijan) than in richer countries with colder climates (e. g., Canada) and <b>in</b> <b>poorer</b> and richer countries with temperate climates (e. g., Uganda, Singapore). The results suggest that performance-related pay may be most effective <b>in</b> <b>poorer</b> countries with colder climates. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

5|$|The First Ostend Raid on 23 April 1918 {{was largely}} a failure, the blockships {{grounded}} {{too far from the}} channels to obstruct them. The second attempt also failed, due to heavy German resistance and British navigational difficulties <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> weather. In anticipation of a raid, the Germans had removed the navigation buoys and without them the British had difficulty finding the narrow channel into the harbour <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> weather. When they did discover the entrance, German resistance proved too strong for the operation to be completed as originally planned: the obsolete cruiser HMS Vindictive was sunk, but only partially blocked the channel.|$|E

Since 1702, the commander there had been Zacharias Animoff, who was old and <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> health. For that reason, in February 1710, Colonel Magnus Stiernstråle officially replaced him; he had de facto headed the efforts to fortify the city.|$|E

5|$|After leaving office, Taft {{returned}} to Yale as a professor, continuing his political activity and working against war through the League to Enforce Peace. In 1921, President Harding appointed Taft as chief justice, an office {{he had long}} sought. Chief Justice Taft was a conservative on business issues, but under him, there were advances in individual rights. <b>In</b> <b>poor</b> health, he resigned in February 1930. After his death the next month, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, the first president and first Supreme Court justice to be interred there. Taft is generally listed near the middle in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E

Bellman, already <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> health from alcoholism, went into decline, drinking increasingly heavily. His drinking very likely contributed to his gout, which troubled him badly in 1790. He also caught tuberculosis: the disease had already killed his mother, and by the winter of 1792, he was seriously ill.|$|E

Approximately 30–60 civilians, largely elderly people, remained in Saborsko. The JNA and SAO Krajina troops forced those who remained behind to leave the village, killing or abusing the civilians. At least 25 civilians were murdered by the troops {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the capture of Saborsko. Some of the victims were shot, while others were beaten or burned to death.|$|E

The First French Republic's finances were <b>in</b> <b>poor</b> shape so its armies would be expected to invade new territories and then live off the conquered lands. Knowing that the French planned to invade Germany, on 20 May 1796 the Austrians announced that the truce would end on 31 May, and prepared for invasion.|$|E
