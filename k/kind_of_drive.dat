50|$|In {{the episode}} Star One, Orac speculated that an unstated {{time before the}} series (but presumably before the {{location}} of Star One was erased), a scout ship from the nearby Andromeda Galaxy had appeared. To protect the Galaxy, thousands of anti-matter space mines were slowly placed between Star One and Andromeda {{as well as at}} other strategic points in the Galaxy. (The logic of this precaution is debatable. Having come two million light years, an invasion force could simply have gone around and approached the planet by the same path as Liberator. On the other hands, since the Andromedans obviously used some kind of faster-than-light drive to make intergalactic flight, it is possible that they were strictly limited by some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> limitation).|$|E
50|$|Two motors were {{mounted in}} each bogie frame. The motors drove large cogwheels via {{spring-loaded}} sprockets on each side, and the cogwheels drove a jackshaft. The crank pins of the jackshafts drove - via a coupling rod - the crank pins {{of the two}} outer drive axles of the bogie. The inner side of this coupling rod contained a pin, which drove the crank pins of the two inner drive axles via a second coupling rod. Because {{of the position of}} the motors, and therefore also the jackshaft, the coupling rods were offset slightly relative to the drive axles. From a maintenance point of view this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> was cheaper than a complex split coupling rod, but during service it was considerably more bumpy.

However, some R/C companies doesn't support this kind of modification and doesn't give any qualification for their officially sponsored events because most enthusiasts can create this kind of modification from recycled parts (gear and pulley fabrication) or parts from [...] companies (e.g. a Yokomo pulley, used on Tamiya chassis which is actually not compatible but fitted through altering of parts), that makes the R/C car out-of-warranty; {{so most of the}} R/C drifting events are usually in open category.|$|E

An appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed to derive some sufficient conditions for designing intermittent sampled-data control as an anti-synchronization law {{in terms of}} LMIs under less restrictive conditions. Thus, the intermittent sampled-data controllers are developed based on the available information to guarantee that the controlled drive system can anti-synchronize with the response system regardless of their initial states. We assume that the intermittent sampling intervals in space are bounded. All the developed results are shown in terms of LMIs and tested on an illustrative example to prove the feasibility and applicability of the proposed method.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To better apply FEA {{technologies}} in product development, viewing {{on the knowledge}} reusing, a knowledge fusion based method was worked out to analyze and optimize product structure. Dynamic knowledge templates were brought into design activities, {{which could be used}} to optimize product solution for more developers conveniently. Therefore, the product design knowledge and optimizing method could be accumulated constantly in enterprises. This method was applied to develop some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>Drive</b> Axle Differential Gear. Actual application shows that the stress concentration area was found, and the unreasonable expanding mechanism was corrected. And then the design of Differential gear was optimized to improve the carrying capacity of base. Thus, the fracture failure rate would be cut down. The drive axle differential gear which features large loading force was one of important parts of automotive transmission. Due to the complexity of loading case, it's difficult to accurately reflect the distribution of stress and deformation by Traditional design methods. The design process of products and the latest design scheme could be analyzed and optimized by FEA technologies. The technology’s high complexity limited more wide application in enterprises. Viewing on the knowledge reusing, a knowledge fusion based method was brought out. B...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of multilevel converters for traction drive systems is being investigated. The main {{advantage of this}} kind of topology is that it can generate almost perfect current or voltage waveforms, because it is modulated by amplitude instead of pulse-width. That means that the pulsating torque generated by harmonics can be eliminated, and power losses into the machine due to harmonic currents can also be eliminated. Another advantage of this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>drive</b> is that the switching frequency and power rating of the semiconductors is reduced considerably. The amplitude modulation is based on a cascade of N converters scaled in a “trinary ” form (three-state “H ” converters). In the chain of N converters of each phase (N-Stage Converter), there is a “Master converter ” that manages more than 80 % of the total power, and N- 1 “Slave converters ” that take the rest of the power (less than 20 %). One important drawback {{of this kind of}} arrangement is that it needs isolated power sources for each one of the N converters, and also for each phase. This paper shows that this problem can be overcome by using isolated motor windings for each phase of the traction motor (which is easy to get in normal machines), and by using low-power high-frequency, bidirectional switching power supplies for the “slave converters”. Simulations using PSIM (Power Electronics Simulator) have demonstrated the feasibility to build drive converters for electric vehicles using multilevel inverters. They are being compared with inverters using the conventional PWM technique. The multilevel converter used in the simulations, works with only four inverters (N= 4) : one Master and three Slaves. In both the cases (PWM and multilevel), the traction motors have a rating of 80 kW, and the battery pack supply is 240 Vdc. The battery pack is connected to the master converters of each phase in parallel, and to the slaves through isolated bi-directional switching power supplies. Copyright 2002 EVS 1...|$|E
