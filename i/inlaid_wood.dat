25|$|The Portrait Hall is {{a formal}} {{apartment}} covering 100 square meters. The room's walls boast large formal portraits of Empress Catherine I and Empress Elizabeth Petrovna, {{as well as}} paintings of Natalya Alexeyevna, sister of Peter the Great, and Empress Catherine II. The inlaid floors of the hall contain precious woods. The Drawing Room of Alexander I was designed between 1752 and 1756 and belonged to the Emperor's private suite. The drawing room stood out {{from the rest of}} the formal rooms in the palace due to the fact that the walls were covered in Chinese silk. Other decor in the room was typical for the palace's formal rooms−a ceiling mural and gilded carvings. The elegant card tables and <b>inlaid</b> <b>wood</b> commode display Japanese, Chinese, and Berlin porcelain.|$|E

60|$|The {{ceiling of}} this {{apartment}} was richly painted, and richly gilt: from it were suspended three lustres by golden cords, which threw a softened light upon {{the floor of}} polished and curiously <b>inlaid</b> <b>woods.</b> At {{the end of the}} apartment was an orchestra.|$|R
50|$|Snowdon {{opened a}} {{workshop}} in Dorking, where he designed and made furniture {{for three years}} before setting up his own company, David Linley Furniture Ltd (now known as LINLEY) where he makes bespoke furniture, upholstery, and interior design products known for their neoclassical appearance and use of <b>inlaid</b> <b>woods.</b> He has written numerous books and lectured around the world. His work is sold in retail stores in Belgravia, Harrods and overseas including the Bespoke Collection.|$|R
60|$|The {{finish of}} this little place is exquisite. We went through some dozen of state-rooms, {{paddling}} along over the slippery floors of <b>inlaid</b> <b>woods</b> in great slippers, without which we must {{have come to the}} ground. How did his Royal Highness the Prince of Orange manage when he lived here, and her Imperial Highness the Princess, and their excellencies the chamberlains and the footmen? They must have been on their tails many times a day, that's certain, and must have cut queer figures.|$|R

Behind it {{appeared}} a high partition of gilt and <b>inlaid</b> <b>wood</b> reaching to the ceiling, and separating the outer from the inner part of the temple. A low archway passage, protected by carved gates similar to those at the front of the building, had been formed in the partition, and through this Ulpius and his prisoners now passed into the recess beyond.|$|E
60|$|Grace {{had been}} taken up into the young lady's own room, and oh! {{what she had to}} tell about tall cheval glasses, and ivory-backed brushes, and rose-coloured curtains, and marble-topped washhand-stands, and a bed and {{wardrobe}} of <b>inlaid</b> <b>wood,</b> with beautiful birds and flowers, and gold-topped bottles and boxes, and downy chairs! The description was enough to last a week, and indeed it did, for fresh details came out continually. It almost made Jessie jealous for Miss Manners. Once when she had been caught in a sudden shower and arrived wet through she {{had been taken}} up to Miss Manners's bed-room to take off her boots and put on slippers.|$|E

Big and little men, like large and small dogs, have usually a sympathetic liking for each other. Dick Moy's chief friend on board was little Jack Shales, who was {{the life of the}} ship, and was particularly expert, as were also most of his mates, in making, during hours of leisure, beautiful workboxes and writing-desks with <b>inlaid</b> <b>woods</b> of varied colours, which were sold at a moderate price on shore, in order to eke out the monthly wage and add to the comforts of wives and little ones at Ramsgate. It may be added that Jack Shales was unquestionably the noisiest man on board. He had a good voice; could sing, and did sing, from morning till night, and had the power of uttering a yell that would have put to shame the wildest warrior among the Cherokee savages! ...|$|R

60|$|I {{opened the}} card-tables. The drawers beneath {{contained}} nothing but cards, {{and the usual}} counters and markers. With {{the exception of one}} pack, the cards in both tables were still wrapped in their paper covers exactly as they had come from the shop. I examined the loose pack, card by card. No writing, no mark of any kind, was visible on any one of them. Assisted by a library ladder which stood against the book-case, I looked next into the two china bowls. Both were perfectly empty. Was there anything more to examine {{on that side of the}} room? In the two corners there were two little chairs of <b>inlaid</b> <b>wood,</b> with red silk cushions. I turned them up and looked under the cushions, and still I made no discoveries. When I had put the chairs back in their places my search on one side of the room was complete. So far I had found nothing.|$|E
6000|$|The {{worst of}} it is, however, that I don't know one thing which I ought very {{thoroughly}} to have known at least thirty years ago, namely, the true {{difference in the way}} of building the trunk in outlaid and <b>inlaid</b> <b>wood.</b> I have an idea that the stem of a palm-tree is only a heap of leaf-roots built up like a tower of bricks, year by year, and that the palm tree really grows on the top of it, like a bunch of fern; but I've no books here, and no time to read them if I had. If only I were a strong giant, instead of a thin old gentleman of fifty-five, how I should like to pull up one of those little palm-trees by the roots--(by the way, what are the roots of a palm like? and, how does it stand in sand, where it is wanted to stand, mostly? Fancy, not knowing that, at fifty-five!)--that grow all along the Riviera; and snap its stem in two, and cut it down the middle. But I suppose there are sections enough now in our grand botanical collections, and you can find it all out for yourself. That {{you should be able to}} ask a question clearly, is two-thirds of the way to getting it answered; and I think this chapter of mine will at {167} least enable you to ask some questions about the stem, though what a stem is, truly, [...] "I am not sent to tell thee, for I do not know." ...|$|E
60|$|The dining-room of {{the ancient}} mansion called Mablethorpe House, {{situated}} in the London suburb of Kensington, is famous among artists and other persons of taste for the carved wood-work, of Italian origin, which covers the walls on three sides. On the fourth side the march of modern improvement has broken in, and has va ried and brightened the scene {{by means of a}} conservatory, forming an entrance to the room through a winter-garden of rare plants and flowers. On your right hand, as you stand fronting the conservatory, the monotony of the paneled wall is relieved by a quaintly patterned door of old <b>inlaid</b> <b>wood,</b> leading into the library, and thence, across the great hall, to the other reception-rooms of the house. A corresponding door on the left hand gives access to the billiard-room, to the smoking-room next to it, and to a smaller hall commanding one of the secondary entrances to the building. On the left side also is the ample fireplace, surmounted by its marble mantelpiece, carved in the profusely and confusedly ornate style of eighty years since. To the educated eye the dining-room, with its modern furniture and conservatory, its ancient walls and doors, and its lofty mantelpiece (neither very old nor very new), presents a startling, almost a revolutionary, mixture of the decorative workmanship of widely differing schools. To the ignorant eye the one result produced is an impression of perfect luxury and comfort, united in the friendliest combination, and developed on the largest scale.|$|E

60|$|I looked round {{quickly to}} see what it might be and lo! there, almost at my side was the veiled Ayesha herself, holding in her hand a little rod made of black <b>wood</b> <b>inlaid</b> with ivory not unlike a field marshal's baton, or a sceptre.|$|R
60|$|But if the King's apartments are sumptuous, {{they are}} as nothing to the Hall of Mirrors, the {{showroom}} of the whole palace, and estimated {{to be the most}} magnificent single room in the world. It extends clear across the end of the rear wing and has a length of 236 feet. It is lighted by vast windows that reach almost to the lofty arch that forms its ceiling; the floor is of polished <b>inlaid</b> <b>wood,</b> on which there stood in Louis the Great's time, tables, chairs, and other furniture of solid silver. The whole inner side of the room is formed by seventeen enormous mirrors set in spaces to correspond in shape to the window opposite, and fitted in between with polished marble. Above them runs a cornice of glittering gilt, and over that again the ceiling curves in a great arch, each panel of it bearing some picture to recall the victories of the Grand Monarch. Ungrateful posterity has somewhat forgotten the tremendous military achievements of Louis XIV--the hardships of his campaign in the Netherlands in which the staff of the royal cuisine was cut down to one hundred cooks--the passage of the Rhine, in which the King actually crossed the river {{from one side to the}} other, and so on. But the student of history can live again the triumphs of Louis in this Hall of Mirrors. It is an irony of history that in this room, after the conquest of 1871, the King of Prussia was proclaimed German Emperor by his subjects and his allies.|$|E
60|$|I {{found myself}} in a large, lofty room, with a {{magnificent}} carved ceiling, and with a carpet over the floor, so thick and soft that it felt like piles of velvet under my feet. One {{side of the room}} was occupied by a long book-case of some rare <b>inlaid</b> <b>wood</b> that was quite new to me. It was not more than six feet high, and the top was adorned with statuettes in marble, ranged at regular distances one from the other. On the opposite side stood two antique cabinets; and between them, and above them, hung a picture of the Virgin and Child, protected by glass, and bearing Raphael's name on the gilt tablet {{at the bottom of the}} frame. On my right hand and on my left, as I stood inside the door, were chiffoniers and little stands in buhl and marquetterie, loaded with figures in Dresden china, with rare vases, ivory ornaments, and toys and curiosities that sparkled at all points with gold, silver, and precious stones. At the lower end of the room, opposite to me, the windows were concealed and the sunlight was tempered by large blinds of the same pale sea-green colour as the curtains over the door. The light thus produced was deliciously soft, mysterious, and subdued; it fell equally upon all the objects in the room; it helped to intensify the deep silence, and the air of profound seclusion that possessed the place; and it surrounded, with an appropriate halo of repose, the solitary figure of the master of the house, leaning back, listlessly composed, in a large easy-chair, with a reading-easel fastened on one of its arms, and a little table on the other.|$|E
60|$|On Friday, we {{all went}} to see the Pope's Palace on the Quirinal. There was a vast hall, and an interminable suite of rooms, cased with marble, floored with marble or mosaics or <b>inlaid</b> <b>wood,</b> adorned with frescos on the vaulted ceilings, and many of them lined with Gobelin tapestry; not wofully faded, like almost all that I have {{hitherto}} seen, but brilliant as pictures. Indeed, some of them so closely resembled paintings, that I could hardly believe they were not so; and the effect was even richer than that of oil-paintings. In every room there was a crucifix; but I did not see a single nook or corner where anybody could have dreamed of being comfortable. Nevertheless, as a stately and solemn residence for his Holiness, it is quite a satisfactory affair. Afterwards, we went into the Pontifical Gardens, connected with the palace. They are very extensive, and laid out in straight avenues, bordered with walls of box, as impervious as if of stone,--not less than twenty feet high, and pierced with lofty archways, cut in the living wall. Some of the avenues were overshadowed with trees, the tops of which bent over and joined one another from either side, so as to resemble a side aisle of a Gothic cathedral. Marble sculptures, much weather-stained, and generally broken-nosed, stood along these stately walks; there were many fountains gushing up into the sunshine; we likewise found a rich flower-garden, containing rare specimens of exotic flowers, and gigantic cactuses, and also an aviary, with vultures, doves, and singing birds. We did not see half the garden, but, stiff and formal as its general arrangement is, it is a beautiful place,--a delightful, sunny, and serene seclusion. Whatever it may be to the pope, two young lovers might find the Garden of Eden here, and never desire to stray out of its precincts. They might fancy angels standing in the long, glimmering vistas of the avenues.|$|E

60|$|The massive tables still {{ran down}} the whole length of the noble room, {{surrounded}} by luxurious couches, as in former days, but not a vestige of food appeared upon their glittering surfaces. Rich vases, flasks, and drinking-cups, all filled with wine, alone occupied the festal board. Above, hanging low from the ceiling, burnt ten large lamps, corresponding {{to the number of}} guests assembled, as the only procurable representatives of the hundreds of revellers who had feasted at Vetranio's expense during the brilliant nights that were now passed for ever. At {{the lower end of the}} room, beyond the grand door of entrance, hung a thick black curtain, apparently intended to conceal mysteriously some object behind it. Before the curtain burnt a small lamp of yellow glass, raised upon a high gilt pole, and around and beneath it, heaped against the side walls, and over part of the table, lay a various and confused mass of rich objects, all of a nature more or less inflammable, and all besprinkled with scented oils. Hundreds of yards of gorgeously variegated hangings, rolls upon rolls of manuscripts, gaudy dresses of all colours, toys, utensils, innumerable articles of furniture formed in rare and beautifully <b>inlaid</b> <b>woods,</b> were carelessly flung together against the walls of the apartment, and rose high towards its ceiling.|$|R
