25|$|The {{appearance}} of cervical mucus and vulvar sensation are generally described together as {{two ways of}} observing the same sign. Cervical mucus is produced by the cervix, which connects the uterus to the vaginal canal.

The production of fertile cervical mucus is caused by estrogen, the same hormone that prepares a woman's body for ovulation. By observing her cervical mucus and {{paying attention to the}} sensation as it passes the vulva, a woman can detect when her body <b>is</b> <b>gearing</b> <b>up</b> for ovulation, and also when ovulation has passed.
