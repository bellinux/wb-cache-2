40|$|Architects intensively use <b>graphic</b> <b>representations</b> to {{communicate}} their design ideas for themselves, between professionals, and others.

25|$|This is {{a parent}} {{education}} and psychotherapy intervention developed by Glen Cooper, Kent Hoffman, Robert Marvin, and Bert Powell designed to shift problematic or 'at risk' patterns of attachment – caregiving interactions {{to a more}} appropriate developmental pathway. It is stated that it is explicitly based on contemporary attachment and congruent developmental theories. Its core constructs are Ainsworth’s ideas of a Secure Base and a Haven of Safety (Ainsworth et al. 1978). The aim of the protocol is to present these ideas to the parents in a user-friendly, common-sense fashion that they can understand both cognitively and emotionally. This is done by a <b>graphic</b> <b>representation</b> of the child's needs and attachment system in circle form, summarising the child's needs and the safe haven provided by the caregiver. The protocol {{has so far been}} aimed at and tested on preschoolers up to the age of 4 years.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, Day & Son was {{commissioned}} by Matthew Digby Wyatt, known for his work as an architect, to produce the book The Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century, an imposing imperial folio in two volumes which illustrates a selection of items from the Great Exhibition of 1851. There are 160 chromolithographed plates. Wyatt himself stated that he had used 'the best means of <b>graphic</b> <b>representation</b> available'. Wyatt proudly {{drew attention to the}} previously unsurpassed scale and speed of production of the book. But what brought the entire project into being was the desire of Day & Son to demonstrate the potential of chromolithography. The firm was particularly associated with the process. However, as Wyatt himself explained, the proposal was not even formalized until after the Great Exhibition had opened. Such a grandiose production must have called into play a significant proportion of Day's resources, including skilled craftsmen and lithographers such as Francis Bedford, J.A. Vinter and Henry Rafter, as well as significant capital, and management. According to Wyatt, four or five of Day's staff were constantly engaged upon the business details of the operation alone.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} bichrome and polychrome vessels {{have also been}} found at Moundville. Stylistically they closely {{resemble}} pottery found along the Tennessee, Cumberland, the lower Ohio River and the central Mississippi Valleys. This pottery was long {{thought to have been}} imported from these other areas as trade items, and modern chemical analysis has shown that much of it is. The same analysis has also proved that some of the pottery was made locally in the Moundville polity. The polychrome pottery has representational motifs painted with red, white, and black pigments. The red and white are applied as slips of colored clay, while the black was made from carbon and applied with a negative or resist technique. Similar in manufacture to the engraved ceramics, the painted pottery has thin walls, was tempered with finely ground mussel shell and was given a polished exterior. This style comes in two major shapes, a bottle with a spherical body and a narrow curving neck and a terraced rectangular bowl that is a Moundville specialty. The rectangular bowl is a vertical-sided, flat-bottomed, rectangular vessel with an eccentric rim, specifically with one side lower than the other three so as to display the containers contents. The designs painted on the rectangular vessels are similar to motifs found on other locally produced wares and include the oblong emblem with an embedded cross-in-circle motif(thought to be a <b>graphic</b> <b>representation</b> of a scalp stretched on a hoop), the hand, the skull, the ogee, concentric circles, rayed concentric circles, rayed semicircles, and rayed spirals.|$|E
500|$|Latin uses {{morphology}} {{to express}} the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of inverse word order in questions, which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase [...] "John is talking to Lucy" [...] is turned into a question, it becomes [...] "Who is John talking to?", and not [...] "John is talking to who?". The latter example {{may be used as}} a way of placing special emphasis on [...] "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called phrases, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels. To the right is a <b>graphic</b> <b>representation</b> of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence [...] "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.|$|E

Reuters reported that an unidentified source informed them on January 27, 1994, that [...] "photos of Michael Jackson's genitalia do not match description given by the boy", which was reported in USA Today on January 28. However, according to child sexual abuse consultant Bill Dworin, {{who was one of the}} lead detectives from the LAPD to the allegations, Jordan Chandler's description comported with the photos taken of Jackson's genitalia. [...] Dr. Richard Strick, who conducted the examination of Jackson's genitals, stated, [...] "I was told later that the photos and description absolutely matched". According to Sneddon in a 2005 memorandum in People v. Jackson, [...] "The photographs reveal a mark on the right side of Defendant's penis at about the same relative location as the dark blemish located by Jordan Chandler on his drawing of Defendant's erect penis" [...] and [...] "Chandler's <b>graphic</b> <b>representation</b> of the discolored area on Defendant's penis is substantially corroborated by the photographs." [...] Sneddon ended his declaration with [...] "I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct except for those statements made on information and belief, as to those statements, I believe them to be true." [...] Sergeant Gary Spiegel, the sheriff’s photographer, claims he observed a dark spot on the lower side of Jackson’s penis.|$|E

2500|$|A {{computer}} <b>graphic</b> <b>representation</b> of {{the projected}} teeth movements, [...] created in the software program ClinCheck, is provided {{to the doctor and}} patient [...] for approval or modification before aligners are manufactured. The aligners are modeled using CAD-CAM (computer-aided-design and computer-aided-manufacturing) software and manufactured using a rapid prototyping technique called stereolithography. The molds for the aligners are built in layers using a photo-sensitive liquid resin that cures into a hard plastic when exposed to a laser. The aligners are made from an elastic thermoplastic material that applies pressure to the teeth to move into the aligner's position. Patients that need a tooth rotated or pulled down may have a small, tooth-colored composite attachment bonded onto certain teeth. More attachments can make the aligners less aesthetically pleasing. Reproximation, (also called interproximal reduction or IPR and colloquially, filing or drilling), is sometimes used at the contacts between teeth to allow for a better fit.|$|E
