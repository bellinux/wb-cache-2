40|$|This {{population-based}} {{cross-sectional study}} evaluates the clinical value of electroretinography and {{visual evoked potential}}s in childhood brain tumor survivors. A flash electroretinography and a checkerboard reversal pattern visual evoked potential (or alternatively a flash visual evoked potential) were done for 51 survivors (age 3. 8 - 28. 7 years) after a mean follow-up time of 7. 6 (1. 5 - 15. 1) years. Abnormal electroretinography was obtained in 1 case, bilaterally delayed abnormal visual evoked potentials in 22 / 51 (43 %) cases. Nine of 25 patients with <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumor</b> location, and altogether 12 out of 31 (39 %) patients {{who did not have}} tumors involving the visual pathways, had abnormal visual evoked potentials. Abnormal electroretinographies are rarely observed, but abnormal visual evoked potentials are common even without evident anatomic lesions in the visual pathway. Bilateral changes suggest a general and possibly multifactorial toxic/adverse effect on the visual pathway. Electroretinography and visual evoked potential may have clinical and scientific value while evaluating long-term effects of childhood brain tumors and tumor treatment...|$|E

Glioblastoma (GBM) rarely presents as an <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumor</b> in adults. The authors present a case of concomitant supratentorial and infratentorial GBM in an adult. A 72 -year-old man presented with headache, nausea, vomiting, and lightheadedness. Initial MR images revealed enhancing masses in the right cerebellum and right posterior periventricular region. The patient underwent a suboccipital craniotomy and resection of the cerebellar lesion. Final histopathology was consistent with glioblastoma. The patient went on to receive standard radiation treatment for GBM with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. However, the patient experienced clinical deterioration {{within a few days}} after starting radiotherapy. He and his family decided to forego treatment and pursue palliative care. Thepatient expired threemonths after the initial diagnosis. Autopsy findings supported the diagnosis of GBM with leptomeningeal gliomatosis and involvement of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The authors review the literature and propose that the pathogenesis of multiple and multicentric GBMmay involve neural stem cells within the subventricular zone or could result from tumor dissemination along established CNS routes, such as white matter tracts and CSF pathways...|$|E

30|$|Considering that CSI did {{not improve}} disease control in {{ependymoma}} at diagnosis (Vanuytsel and Brada 1991), some of our patients received focal radiotherapy for isolated metastasis. The finding of paramount importance {{in this study is}} the lack of long-term disease control of patients undergoing focal techniques (hypoFFRT, FFRT, spinal RT) for isolated metastatic relapses, especially for patients with spinal metastasis of an <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumor</b> compared with a better control for patients treated for metastatic recurrences receiving CSI, even with more extensive disease at relapse. Most of the failures of re-irradiation were outside the radiation field, especially for those treated with a hypoFFRT, suggesting that CSI could improve disease control at this stage as well. To reinforce this idea, we also observed two patients with metastatic relapse re-irradiated by CSI excluding posterior fossa field who experienced posterior fossa RT 2 relapse. Good disease control was achieved in patients with metastatic relapses re-treated by CSI even without recourse of surgery of the metastases proved elsewhere to be associated with a better prognosis. Merchant et al. reported a series of 12 patients with metastatic relapse treated by CSI with OS 100  % at 5  years and 9 of 12 patients without relapse after RT 2 with a median follow up of 22  months (range 3 – 69) (Merchant et al. 2008). Bouffet et al. (2012) also reported good results in his series with all patients treated by CSI due to metastatic disease (n =  4) alive at a median follow up of 1.9  years (range 0.6 – 4.7). Our data showing the lack of efficacy of local irradiation of isolated metastasis speak in favor of a systematic craniospinal re-irradiation without PF sparing that was more efficient also in the two other cases series reported (Bouffet et al. 2012; Merchant et al. 2008).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the incidence of seizures during the intraoperative monitoring of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by electrical brain stimulation in a wide spectrum of surgeries such as those of the orthopedic spine, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves, interventional radiology procedures, and craniotomies for supra- and <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumors</b> and vascular lesions. METHODS The authors retrospectively analyzed data from 4179 consecutive patients who underwent surgery or an interventional radiology procedure with MEP monitoring. RESULTS Of 4179 patients, only 32 (0. 8 %) had 1 or more intraoperative seizures. The incidence of seizures in cranial procedures, including craniotomies and interventional neuroradiology, was 1. 8 %. In craniotomies in which transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) was applied to elicit MEPs, the incidence of seizures was 0. 7 % (6 / 850). When direct cortical stimulation was additionally applied, the incidence of seizures increased to 5. 4 % (23 / 422). Patients undergoing craniotomies for the excision of extraaxial brain tumors, particularly meningiomas (15 patients), exhibited the highest risk of developing an intraoperative seizure (16 patients). The incidence of seizures in orthopedic spine surgeries was 0. 2 % (3 / 1664). None of the patients who underwent surgery for conditions of the spinal cord, neck, or peripheral nerves or who underwent cranial or noncranial interventional radiology procedures had intraoperative seizures elicited by TES during MEP monitoring. CONCLUSIONS In this largest such study to date, the authors report the incidence of intraoperative seizures in patients who underwent MEP monitoring during a wide spectrum of surgeries such as those of the orthopedic spine, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves, interventional radiology procedures, and craniotomies for supra- and <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumors</b> and vascular lesions. The low incidence of seizures induced by electrical brain stimulation, particularly short-train TES, demonstrates that MEP monitoring is a safe technique that should not be avoided due to the risk of inducing seizures...|$|R

Between July- 2004 and March- 2013, 50 patients with intracranial ependymoma (n =  46, grade 3) received involved-field PT at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). Median age at time of PT was 2. 6  years (range 1. 1 - 15. 2). Thirty-six patients had infratentorial and 14 supratentorial ependymomas. Seventeen patients presented with macroscopic residual disease after subtotal resection before starting PT (8 with ≤ 1. 5  cc and 9 with > 1. 5  cc residual tumor respectively). Forty-three (86  %) patients received post-operative chemotherapy before PT according to protocols; 44 (88  %) patients younger than 5  years required general anesthesia. Median prescribed dose was 59. 4  Gy (RBE) (range 54 - 60) delivered in 1. 8 - 2  Gy (RBE) per fraction. Late toxicity was assessed according to CTCAE v 4. 0. With a mean follow-up time of 43. 4  months (range 8. 5 - 113. 7) seven patients experienced local failure (6 with <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumors</b> and 1 with supratentorial tumor); four of the local failures were in patients with residual disease ≥ 1. 5  cc {{at the time of}} PT and 3 without residual macroscopic disease.

The PedsQL™ Brain Tumor Module is comprised of six scales: Cognitive Problems, Pain and Hurt, Movement and Balance, Procedural Anxiety, Nausea, and Worry. In the present study, we developed the Japanese version of the PedsQL™ Brain Tumor Module and investigated its feasibility, reliability, and validity among Japanese children and their parents. Methods Translation equivalence and content validity were verified using the standard back-translation method and cognitive debriefing tests. Participants were recruited from 6 hospitals in Japan and the Children's Cancer Association of Japan, and questionnaires were completed by 137 children with brain tumors and 166 parents. Feasibility of the questionnaire was determined based on the amount of time required to complete the form and the percentage of missing values. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's coefficient alpha. Test-retest reliability was assessed by retesting 22 children and 27 parents. Factorial validity was verified by exploratory factor analyses. Known-groups validity was described with regard to whole brain irradiation, developmental impairment, <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumors,</b> paresis, and concurrent chemotherapy. Convergent and discriminant validity were determined using Generic Core Scales and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for children. Results Internal consistency was relatively high for all scales (Cronbach's coefficient alpha > 0. 70) except the Pain and Hurt scale for the child-report, and sufficient test-retest reliability was demonstrated for all scales (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0. 45 - 0. 95). Factorial validity was supported through exploratory factor analysis (factor-item correlation = 0. 33 - 0. 96 for children, 0. 55 - 1. 00 for parents). Evaluation of known-groups validity confirmed that the Cognitive Problems scale was sensitive for developmental impairment, the Movement and Balance scale for <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumors</b> or paresis, and the Nausea scale for a patient currently undergoing chemotherapy.

40|$|Background: There is {{controversy}} about the global distribution of intracranial tumors (ICTs). The previous reports from Africa suggested low frequency and different pattern of distribution of brain tumors from what obtains in other continents. The limitations at that time, including paucity of diagnostic facilities and personnel, have improved. Objective: The {{objective of this}} study is to analyze the current trend and distribution of histology confirmed brain tumors managed in Enugu, in a decade. Methods: A retrospective analysis of ICTs managed between 2006 and 2015 at Memfys Hospital, Enugu. Only cases with conclusive histology report were analyzed. The World Health Organization ICT classification was used. Results: This study reviewed 252 patients out of 612 neuroimaging diagnosed brain tumors. Mean age was 42. 8 years and male-to-female ratio was 1. 2 : 1. 0. Annual frequency increased from 11 in 2006 to 55 in 2015. Metastatic brain tumors accounted for 5. 6 %, and <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumors</b> represented 16. 3 %. Frequency of the common primary tumors were meningioma (32. 9 %), glioma (23. 8 %), pituitary adenomas (13. 5 %), and craniopharyngioma (7. 5 %) (P = 0. 001). Vestibular schwannoma accounted for 1. 2 %. Meningioma did not have gender difference (P = 0. 714). Medulloblastoma, glioma, and craniopharyngioma were the most common pediatric tumors.

40|$|BACKGROUND Ependymal {{tumors in}} adults are rare, {{accounting}} {{for less than}} 4 % of primary tumors of {{the central nervous system}} in this age group. The low prevalence of intracranial ependymoma in adults limits the ability to perform clinical trials. Therefore, treatment decisions are based on small, mostly retrospective studies and the role of chemotherapy has remained unclear. METHODS We performed a retrospective study on 17 adult patients diagnosed with intracranial World Health Organisation grade II or III ependymoma, who were treated with chemotherapy {{at any time during the}} disease course. Benefit from chemotherapy was estimated by applying Macdonald criteria. Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated from start of chemotherapy, using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Eleven patients had supratentorial and 6 <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumors.</b> Ten patients were treated with temozolomide (TMZ), 3 with procarbazine/lomustine/vincristine (PCV), 3 with platinum-based chemotherapy and 1 patient received epirubicin/ifosfamide. Response rates were as follows: TMZ 8 / 10 stable disease; PCV 3 / 3 stable disease; platinum-based chemotherapy 1 / 3 partial response; epirubicin/ifosfamide 1 / 1 complete response. PFS rates at 6, 12 and 24 months were 52. 9, 35. 3 and 23. 5 %. OS rates at 6, 12 and 24 months were 82. 4, 82. 4 and 70. 1 %. There was no indication for a favourable prognostic role of O (6) -methylguanyl-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation which was detected in 3 / 12 investigated tumors.

Aim: To study the demographic and histopathologic profile of PBTs according to World Health Organization 2007 classification in a single tertiary health care center in India. Materials and Methods: Data regarding age, gender, topography, and histopathology of 76 pediatric patients (0 – 19 years) with brain tumors operated {{over a period of}} 24 months (January- 2012 to December- 2013) was collected retrospectively and analyzed using EpiInfo 7.

Results: PBTs were more common in males (55. 3 %) as compared to females (44. 7 %) with male to female ratio of 1. 23 : 1. Mean age was 10. 69 years. Frequency of tumors was higher in childhood age group (65. 8 %) when compared to adolescent age group (34. 2 %). The most common anatomical site was cerebellum (39. 5 %), followed by hemispheres (22. 4 %). Supratentorial tumors (52. 6 %) were predominant than <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumors</b> (47. 4 %).

40|$|Overall, {{pediatric}} high-grade glioma (pHGG) has a poor prognosis, in {{part due}} to the lack of understanding of the underlying biology. High-resolution 244 K oligo array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used to analyze DNA from 38 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded predominantly pretreatment pHGG samples, including 13 diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs). The patterns of gains and losses were distinct from those seen in HGG arising in adults. In particular, we found 1 q gain in up to 27 % of our cohort compared with 9 % reported in adults. A total of 13 % had a balanced genetic profile with no large-scale copy number alterations. Homozygous loss at 8 p 12 was seen in 6 of 38 (16 %) cases of pHGG. This novel deletion, which includes the ADAM 3 A gene, was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Loss of CDKN 2 A/CDKN 2 B in 4 of 38 (10 %) samples by oligo array CGH was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization on tissue microarrays and was restricted to supratentorial tumors. Only ∼ 50 % of supratentorial tumors were positive for CDKN 2 B expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while ∼ 75 % of <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumors</b> were positive for CDKN 2 B expression (P = 0. 03). Amplification of the 4 q 11 – 13 region was detected in 8 % of cases and included PDGFRA and KIT, and subsequent qPCR analysis was consistent with the amplification of PDGFRA. MYCN amplification was seen in 5 % of samples being significantly associated with anaplastic astrocytomas (P= 0. 03). Overall, DIPG shared similar spectrum of changes to supratentorial HGG with some notable differences, including high-frequency loss of 17 p and 14 q and lack of CDKN 2 A/CDKN 2 B deletion. Informative genetic data providing insight into the underlying biology and potential therapeutic possibilities can be generated from archival tissue and typically small biopsies from DIPG. Our findings highlight the importance of obtaining pretreatment samples...|$|R
40|$|Sixty-seven {{cases of}} non-communicating {{hydrocephalus}} treated {{according to the}} Torkildsen's procedure are reported. The spinal fluid blockage was caused in 55 cases by supratentorial and in 10 cases by infratentorial tumors; in the remaining cases the spinal fluid interruption was due to non-tumoral causes. Ventriculography {{was the most important}} examination performed as far as the local diagnosis was concerned. 15 patients in this series disclosed lethal complications with signs of brain stem lesions. Patient survival was 3. 9 years with variation ranging from 1 to 9 years. The following conclusions were drawn: 1) Ventriculocisternostomy is a valious method for the treatment of non-communicating hidrocephalus for it allows a more physiological drainage of the spinal fluid besides favouring the exploration of the posterior fossa in cases of doudtful pre-operative diagnosis. This procedure is of low cost and involves a relatively simple tecnique as compared with other procedures which demand the use of special valves. 2) According to the review of the pertinent literature the best results have been accomplished in cases where there is a non-tumoral aqueduct stenosis as well as in inoperable tumors of the third ventricle. 3) Bilateral drainage is mandatory in cases of bilateral obstruction of Monro's foramina. It has also been indicated in all cases as a precaution due to the possibility of occlusion of one catheter. 4) Ventriculocisternostomy should also be indicated as a prophylactic treatment of non-communicating hydrocephalus in cases of inoperable tumors of the sela or the basal ganglia with compression of the third ventricle but without completly blockage of the ventricle system. 5) Ventriculocisternostomy should be indicated with some reserve in cases of <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumors</b> as well as in great supratentorial space-occupying lesions. It is however contra-indicated in cases of large tumors and in the inflammatory process involving the posterior fossa. 6) In the present series the obstruction of the draining-system was very uncommon being observed in only three patients. 7) No cases of spinal fluid fistula or meningitis were observed in the present study...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: p 53 is a tumor {{suppressor}} gene implicated in the genesis {{of a variety of}} malignancies including brain tumors. Overexpression of the p 53 protein is often used as a surrogate indicator of alterations in the p 53 gene. AIMS: In this study, data is presented on p 53 protein expression in adult cases (> 15 years of age) of astrocytic (n= 152) and oligodendroglial (n= 28) tumors of all grades. Of the astrocytic tumors, 86 &#x 0025; were supratentorial in location while remaining 14 &#x 0025; were located infratentorially - 8 in the the cerebellum and 13 in the brainstem. All the oligodendrogliomas were supratentorial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: p 53 protein expression was evaluated on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections using streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase technique after high temperature antigen retrieval. RESULTS: Overall 52 &#x 0025; of supratentorial astrocytic tumors showed p 53 immunopositivity with no correlation to the histological grade. Thus, 58. 8 &#x 0025; of diffuse astrocytomas (WHO Grade II), 53. 8 &#x 0025; of anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO Grade III) and 50 &#x 0025; of glioblastomas (WHO Grade IV) were p 53 protein positive. In contrast, all the <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumors</b> were p 53 negative except for one brainstem glioblastoma. Similarly, pilocytic astrocytomas were uniformly p 53 negative irrespective of the location. Among oligodendroglial tumors, the overall frequency of p 53 immunopositivity was lower (only 28 &#x 0025;), though a trend of positive correlation with the tumor grade was noted - 25 &#x 0025; in Grade II and 31. 5 &#x 0025; in grade III (anaplastic oligodendroglioma). Interestingly, p 53 labeling index (p 53 LI) did not correlate with the histopathological grade in both astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, this study gives an insight into the genetic and hence biological heterogeneity of gliomas, not only between astrocytic tumors vs. oligodendrogliomas but also within astrocytic tumors with regard to their grade and location. With p 53 gene therapy trials in progress, this will possibly have future therapeutic implications...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE Pediatric {{high-grade}} gliomas (pHGGs) including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) are primary {{brain tumors}} with high mortality and morbidity. Because of their poor brain penetrance, systemic chemotherapy regimens {{have failed to}} deliver satisfactory results; however, convection-enhanced delivery (CED) may be an alternative mode of drug delivery. Anthracyclines are potent chemotherapeutics that have been successfully delivered via CED in preclinical supratentorial glioma models. This study aims to assess the potency of anthracyclines against DIPG and pHGG cell lines in vitro and to evaluate the efficacy of CED with anthracyclines in orthotopic pontine and thalamic tumor models. METHODS The sensitivity of primary pHGG cell lines {{to a range of}} anthracyclines was tested in vitro. Preclinical CED of free doxorubicin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) to the brainstem and thalamus of naive nude mice was performed. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined based on the observation of clinical symptoms, and brains were analyzed after H & E staining. Efficacy of the MTD was tested in adult glioma E 98 -FM-DIPG and E 98 -FM-thalamus models and in the HSJD-DIPG- 007 -Fluc primary DIPG model. RESULTS Both pHGG and DIPG cells were sensitive to anthracyclines in vitro. Doxorubicin was selected for further preclinical evaluation. Convection-enhanced delivery of the MTD of free doxorubicin and PLD in the pons was 0. 02 mg/ml, and the dose tolerated in the thalamus was 10 times higher (0. 2 mg/ml). Free doxorubicin or PLD via CED was ineffective against E 98 -FM-DIPG or HSJD-DIPG- 007 -Fluc in the brainstem; however, when applied in the thalamus, 0. 2 mg/ml of PLD slowed down tumor growth and increased survival in a subset of animals with small tumors. CONCLUSIONS Local delivery of doxorubicin to the brainstem causes severe toxicity, even at doxorubicin concentrations that are safe in the thalamus. As a consequence, the authors could not establish a therapeutic window for treating orthotopic brainstem tumors in mice. For tumors in the thalamus, therapeutic concentrations to slow down tumor growth could be reached. These data suggest that anatomical location determines the severity of toxicity after local delivery of therapeutic agents and that caution should be used when translating data from supratentorial CED studies to treat <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumors...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{of more than}} one brain tumor in a single patient is not new, resulting from RT- or CT-induced neoplasms, syndromes or casual association. We report on the exceptional case of a 12 -year-old boy harboring three different brain tumors with no definite correlation. The first MRI showed a medulloblastoma with signs of <b>infratentorial</b> and supratentorial <b>tumor</b> spreading, including a small frontal mass. Despite the good response to surgical and adjuvant treatment, the frontal mass remained unchanged and was excised, revealing a lipoastrocytoma. Finally, the possible local recurrence of the original medulloblastoma was a pilocytic astrocytoma with post-radiation alterations. Explanations of this very unusual association include radio-induced tumors, second tumors developing from remnants of medulloblastoma cancer stem cells, or the changing histology after adjuvant therapy...|$|R
40|$|Medulloepitheliomas (WHO grade IV) are rare, {{malignant}} embryonal tumors {{of pediatric}} population, classified under {{the central nervous}} system (CNS) primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET). Histologically, these tumors are characterized by neoplastic neuroepithelium recapitulating the embryonic neural tube. We describe a rare case of infratentorial medulloepithelioma with divergent differentiation in a 1 -year-old male child who presented with headache, vomiting, and seizures. Histopathologic examination of the excised tumor revealed the characteristic neuroepithelium, along with other areas showing primitive neuroectodermal (blastemal) cells in sheets, ependymoblastic rosettes, and nodular areas of neuronal differentiation. Possibly, this proliferating immature neuroepithelium is the cause of poor outcome in medulloepitheliomas. Due to the rarity of these tumors, it remains to be established whether <b>infratentorial</b> location or <b>tumors</b> with divergent differentiation are also predictors of adverse prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to formulate location-wise radiologic diagnostic algorithms and assess their concordance with the final histopathological diagnosis so as to evaluate their utility in a rural setting where only basic facilities are available. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis to assess the concordance of radiology (primarily MRI) with final histopathology report was done. Based on the most common incidence of tumor location and basic radiology findings, diagnostic algorithms were prepared. Results: For supratentorial intraaxial parenchymal location concordance was seen in all high-grade astrocytomas, low- and high-grade oligodendrogliomas, metastatic tumors, primitive neuroectodermal tumors, high-grade ependymomas, neuronal and mixed neuro-glial tumors and tumors of hematopoietic system. Lowest concordance was seen in low-grade astrocytomas. In the supratentorial intraaxial ventricular location, agreement was observed in choroid plexus tumors, ependymomas, low-grade astrocytomas and meningiomas; in the supratentorial extraaxial location, except for the lack of concordance in the only case of metastatic tumor, concordance was observed in meningeal tumors, tumors of the sellar region, tumors of cranial and paraspinal nerves; the infratentorial intraaxial parenchymal location showed agreement in low- as well as high-grade astrocytomas, metastatic tumors, high-grade ependymoma, embryonal tumors and hematopoietic tumors; in the infratentorial intraaxial ventricular location, except for the lack of concordance in one case of low-grade astrocytoma and two cases of medulloblastomas, agreement was observed in low- and high-grade ependymoma; <b>infratentorial</b> extraaxial <b>tumors</b> showed complete agreement in all tumors of cranial and paraspinal nerves, meningiomas, and hematopoietic tumors. Conclusion: A location-based approach to central nervous system (CNS) tumors is helpful in establishing an appropriate differential diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|No {{reliable}} classification is {{in clinical}} {{use for the}} therapeutic stratification of children with ependymoma, such that disease risk might be identified and patients treated to ensure a combination of maximal cure rates and minimal adverse therapeutic effects. This study has examined associations between clinicopathologic and cytogenetic variables and outcome in a trial cohort of children with ependymoma, {{with the aim of}} defining a practical scheme for stratifying this heterogeneous tumor. Intracranial ependymomas (n = 146) from children treated on the RT 1 trial at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital were evaluated for the status of multiple pathological features. Interphase FISH (iFISH) defined the status of loci on chromosomes 1 q (EXO 1), 6 q (LATS 1) and 9, including 9 p 21 (CDKN 2 A). Data relating to these clinicopathological and cytogenetic variables were compared with survival data in order to model disease risk groups. Extent of surgical resection was a significant determinant of outcome in both supratentorial and <b>infratentorial</b> compartments. <b>Tumor</b> cell density and mitotic count were associated with outcome among children with posterior fossa ependymomas (n = 119). Among pathologic features, only brain invasion was associated with outcome in children with supratentorial ependymomas (n = 27). For posterior fossa tumors, gain of 1 q was independently associated with outcome and in combination with clinicopathological variables defined both a two-tier and three-tier system of disease risk. Among children developing posterior fossa ependymomas treated with maximal surgical resection and conformal radiotherapy, key clinicopathological variables and chromosome 1 q status can be used to define tiers of disease risk. In contrast, risk factors for pediatric supratentorial tumors are limited to sub-total resection and brain invasion...|$|R

Their differential diagnosis using computed tomography (CT) and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) is difficult because of similarities in morphologic features with other intracranial tumors and meningiomas. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and CT and MRI findings of 32 patients diagnosed with HPCs via histopathology. We evaluated the location, shape, morphologic patterns, density, and signal intensity of the tumors and classified them into four types. Results: The number of tumors analyzed was 32; 29 were supratentorial and three were <b>infratentorial.</b> Eighteen <b>tumors</b> were lobular, while 14 were oval in shape. Further, 28 tumors had cystic areas, and 16 had signal-void vessels. Among the 20 tumors that had been scanned by MRI; eleven showed isointensity, eight slight hyperintensity, and one slight hypointensity on T 1 -weighted image. Moreover, 12 showed isointensity, and eight showed slight hyperintensity on T 2 -weighted image and T 2 -weighted-fluid-attenuated-inversion recovery. Diffusion-weighted images showed isointensity (9 / 13) or slight hyperintensity (4 / 13). Of the 15 tumors scanned by contrast-enhanced MRI, one showed poor enhancement; six, moderate enhancement; and eight, intense enhancement. Only one tumor exhibited the “dural tail” sign. Moreover, calcification was observed in just one tumor on CT imaging (1 / 22). All tumors (5 / 5) showed intense enhancement on CT angiography, whereas some exhibited dual blood supply (2 / 5). Conclusion: We conclude that tumors present outside the brain parenchyma, with isointense to slightly intense regions on MRI scans, oval/lobular shape, well-/ill-defined margins, signal-void vessels, apparent cystic areas, dual blood supply, and intense enhancement on CT or MRI scans, but without calcification or a “dural tail” sign, may be diagnosed as HPCs.
