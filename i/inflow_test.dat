The code is a direct extension of the hydrodynamic code of Hawley, Smarr, and Wilson, and uses Evans and Hawley constrained transport (CT) to evolve the magnetic fields. Two categories of test cases were undertaken. A one dimensional version of the code (Minkowski metric) was used to verify code performance in the special relativistic limit. The tests include Alfvén wave propagation, fast and slow magnetosonic shocks, rarefaction waves, and both relativistic and non-relativistic shock tubes. A series of one- and two-dimensional tests were also {{carried out in the}} Kerr metric: magnetized Bondi inflow, a magnetized <b>inflow</b> <b>test</b> due to Gammie, and two-dimensional magnetized constant-l tori that are subject to the magnetorotational instability.

40|$|A {{pilot hole}} test was {{conducted}} to support {{the design of the}} Degassing of Groundwater and Two-Phase Flow experiments planned for the Hard Rock Laboratory, Aespoe, Sweden. The test consisted of a sequence of constant pressure borehole <b>inflow</b> <b>tests</b> (CPTs) and pressure recovery tests (PRTs) in borehole KA 2512 A. The test sequence was designed to detect degassing effects from the change in transmissivity, or hydraulic conductivity, and storativity when the borehole pressure is lowered below the groundwater bubble pressure. The entire 37. 3 m of the borehole section was tested without packers. Flow response to pressure changes in CPTs occurred rapidly. Flowrates fluctuated before attaining a steady trend, probably due to effective stress changes when borehole pressure was reduced for the first time. These factors decreased the sensitivity of type-curve fits to values of specific storage. The relationship between borehole pressure and steady-state flowrates was linear over borehole pressures of 1500 kPa (abs) down to 120 kPa (abs) during testing in December 1994, indicating that processes that may change hydraulic conductivity at low borehole pressures, such as degassing, calcite precipitation or turbulence, did not occur to a measurable degree. Test results during January and February of 1995 suggest that degassing may have occurred. The hydraulic conductivity measured at a borehole pressure equal to 120 kPa (abs) was 20 % lower than the hydraulic conductivity measured at a borehole pressure of 1500 kPa (abs); the latter value was 10 % lower than the hydraulic conductivity measured in December, 1994. The volumetric gas content measured during this time was 1 % v/v. Pressures in monitoring well KA 2511 A responded to the testing in KA 2512 A. Step-changes in flowrates coincided with blasting at 3300 - 3400 m tunnel length. The magnitude of these changes was greater at the lower borehole pressures.

This study uses newly collected data on 109 countries {{to examine the}} effects of investment promotion on FDI <b>inflows.</b> We <b>test</b> whether sectors explicitly targeted by investment promotion agencies in their efforts to attract FDI receive more investment in the post-targeting period, relative to the pre-targeting period and nontargeted sectors. The results of our analysis are consistent with investment promotion leading to higher FDI flows to countries in which information asymmetries are likely to be severe. Investment promotion efforts appear to be reasonably cost effective. A dollar spent on investment promotion is found to increase FDI inflows by 189 dollars.

I find that governments are more likely to restrict FDI intended to compete in local markets than FDI that exploits cost advantages.

Our main finding, based on VAR modeling, is that we cannot consider remittances as a driver of economic growth in Belarus: their positive influence on GDP growth is not statistically significant. In fact, in the next period GDP responds negatively to remittances growth (p-value is 0. 005). To some extent {{this may be a}} result of a productivity decrease conditioned by possible brain-drain effects and high employee turnover. Remittances appear to be strongly pro-cyclical with respect to Russian GDP and mildly pro-cyclical with respect to the GDP of Belarus. Analysis shows that negative influence of remittances on GDP is not caused by Dutch disease and inflation: neither exchange rate appreciation nor growth in consumer price is induced by remittances. Instead, lagged REER devaluation Granger causes growth in remittances <b>inflow</b> (Wald <b>test</b> p-value is 0. 051) : when in a crisis devaluation takes place in Belarus more people go abroad to support their families and more transfers come from abroad.

40|$|This paper sheds {{lights the}} on the {{performance}} of Latin American governments in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) through trade policies [...] specifically by signing free trade agreements with other countries. The relationship between FDI and trade for Latin America has previously been analyzed. According to these studies, the relationship between the degree of “openness” (imports plus exports divided by the domestic product) and FDI has not been conclusive. At the same time, the effect of specific trade policies on the behavior of FDI inflows has not been extensively studied. Some state policies on trade could produce a significant impact in attracting FDI inflows. Specifically, through the implementation of several free trade agreements, several Latin American countries have been able to attract greater inflows of foreign direct investment. The implementation of these free trade agreements was part of a more general plan of economic reforms that Latin American countries launched since the mid- 1980 s. Those countries that signed more free trade agreements – or signed them with the largest economies in the world –increased their effectiveness in attracting FDI <b>inflows.</b> I <b>test</b> the impact of this policy on the behavior of FDI inflows through a panel data model (with feasible generalized least squares estimators) for seventeen Latin American countries and for the period ranging from 1985 to 2003. ...|$|R
40|$|We analyze why {{managers}} of open-ended mutual funds choose {{to close their}} funds to new investment. Borrowing from Berk and Green (2004), we develop {{a model of the}} mutual fund closure decision where the main ingredient is a negative relationship between fund size and the fund’s realized return. We show that funds will find it optimal to restrict inflows following a period of superior performance. Because there is uncertainty regarding managerial skill, following closure, there is a net outflow of money that reduces the fund’s size and allows more skilled managers to realize higher returns. Therefore funds reopen after reductions in TNA, which allow them to maintain their pre-closing performance. Moreover, we show that the length of the fund closure period is positively related to post-reopening net <b>inflows.</b> We <b>test</b> the empirical predictions of the model on a sample of 141 equity mutual funds that closed to new investment between 1992 and 2002. Consistent with the model, closing funds outperform matching funds in the year prior to the closing, both in terms of inflows and returns. Closing also enables funds to retain their superior performance in the year following closure. Finally, we find that excess fund flows at reopening are significantly related to the length of the fund closure period.

We have compared the evolution of AGN due to such a DI accretion mode with that arising in a scenario where galaxy interactions (IT mode) produce the sudden destabilization of large quantities of gas feeding the AGN; this constitutes the standard AGN feeding mode implemented in the earliest versions of most semi-analytic models. To study the maximal contribution of DI to the evolution of the AGN population, we extended and developed the Hopkins & Quataert (2011) model to assess the effects of changing the assumed disk surface density profile, and to obtain lower limits for the nuclear star formation rates associated to the DI accretion mode. We obtained the following results: i) for luminosity M 1450 & − 26 AGN the DI mode can provide the BH accretion needed to match the observed AGN luminosity functions up to z ≈ 4. 5; in such a luminosity range and redshift, it constitutes a viable candidate mechanism to fuel AGN, and can compete with the IT scenario as the main driver of cosmological evolution of the AGN population: ii) The DI scenario cannot provide the observed abundance of high-luminosity QSO with M 1450 ≤ − 26 AGN, as well as the abundance of high-redhshift z & 4. 5 QSO with M 1450 ≤ − 24.

The measurements were carried out in the period from 03. 07. 2012 – 20. 9. 2012 once a day from Monday till Friday on the tested filtration device and namely flow measurements and reading of heights in the filtration device chambers and reading of suspended solid contents (TSS) on the continuous measurement on the outflow from the secondary clarifier. Measuring of parameters TSS and COD was carried out in the laboratory. After 17 th of August 2012, the testing of tested filtration device was upgraded by including the simulation of increased load with TSS on the inflow into the device. From that day on, the load with TSS on the <b>inflow</b> into the <b>tested</b> device Mini filter 1 was gradually increased. The purpose of simulation was to reach the load point with TSS where the cloth filtration device Mini filter 1 will be constantly in the procedure of cleaning or removing the captured solid particles from the filtration cloth. This point wasn't reached. Yet a minimum time during rinsing under 2 minutes was achieved. Meaning, that the device was once again in the state of cleaning less than 2 minutes. The cleaning procedure didn't affect the filtration process of inflow water...|$|R
40|$|Inflows affect water quality, {{food web}} dynamics, {{and even the}} {{incidence}} of harmful algal blooms. It may be that inflows can be manipulated to create refuge habitat for biota trying to escape poor environmental conditions, such as fish populations in lakes during times of toxic Prymnesium parvum blooms. Water availability sometimes can be an issue, especially in arid climates, which limits this approach to management. Utilizing source water from deeper depths to displace surface waters, however, might effectively mimic <b>inflow</b> events. I <b>test</b> this notion by conducting in-lake mesocosm experiments with natural plankton communities where I manipulate hydraulic flushing. Results show that P. parvum cell density is reduced by 69 %, and ambient toxicity completely ameliorates during pre-bloom conditions in the lake. During conditions of bloom development, population density is reduced by 53 %, toxicity by 57 %, and bloom proportions are never reached. There is minimal effect of these inflows on total phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass, and little effect on water quality. Shifts toward more rapidly growing phytoplankton taxa are observed, as are enhanced copepod nauplii. In other words, while inflows using deep waters suppress P. parvum bloom initiation and development, they are benign to {{other aspects of the}} lower food web and environment. The results from using deep lake water to suppress harmful algal blooms indicate this may be a promising management approach and further studies are recommended to test whether this mitigating effect can translate to a large-scale in-lake treatment...|$|R
40|$|Liberals {{claim that}} {{countries}} avoid conflict {{in order not}} to disrupt economically beneficial exchange. The statement that economic integration reduces the likelihood of conflict is largely based on the effects of trade. A similar rationale can be applied to economic interdependence in the form of international capital exchange. A state is expected to avoid political risk, especially severe forms such as militarized disputes, {{in order not to}} deter investors. This study tests, on the dyadic and monadic levels of analyses, whether the liberal peace proposition holds when economic integration is operationalized as foreign direct investment (FDI) stocks, inflows, and outflows. The results for the years 1980 - 2000 indicate that inflows and stock of foreign investment reduce the risk of an outbreak of a fatal dispute, regardless of whether they are tested in a single equation or a simultaneous equation model. Thus, reverse causality does not bias the pacifying effect of foreign investment inflows and stock. The results also support the underlying notion of the commercial peace that militarized conflicts inhibit foreign investment. The onset of a fatal conflict reduces FDI <b>inflows,</b> and, if <b>tested</b> in a two-stage instrumental variable approach, FDI stock, the most complete measure of economic integration through foreign investment. Accounting for endogeneity seems particularly important when analyzing the link between the onset of fatal disputes and the outflow of FDI. causality, flows, foreign direct investment, militarized interstate disputes, stocks...|$|R
