Rossini's opera {{has enjoyed}} a high {{critical}} reputation throughout the years: 19th-century critic Henry Chorley said that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> melody, {{there is not an}} ugly bar in Le comte Ory", and Richard Osborne, writing in Grove Music Online, calls details that the work is one of the [...] "wittiest, most stylish and most urbane of all comic operas".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{frequently}} {{compared the}} game to other games, including Crash Bandicoot, and commented on its simplicity and its price, which {{was thought to be}} low. A writer for Complex included it on a list of company-branded games that [...] "didn't suck", commenting that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> game as long as the player can tolerate the large amount of advertisement in it. According to Uchikoshi, the game did not sell well.|$|E
500|$|John Teti of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B+, which tied {{it for the}} best grade of [...] "Animation Domination" [...] after American Dad!. He stated that [...] "The {{showdown}} at Five Corners played out just like 'Cape Feare,' complete with rake gag, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing. If The Simpsons intends to self-plagiarize (and it obviously does), that's a good episode to copy." [...] Sharon Knolle of AOL TV said, [...] "I'd say overall this ep ranks {{with some of the}} better Sideshow Bob eps, if not the very best. Certainly, it beats the heck out of 'The Italian Bob' and 'Funeral for a Fiend.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Populous: The Beginning played very {{differently}} from earlier titles. Edge concluded {{that while the}} more rigid play format of The Beginning was new to the series, it {{had the effect of}} making the end result [...] "less show-stopping"; Edge believed that the game was caught between the god game and RTS genres, and did not excel at either. [...] PCGamer subsequently decided the game {{failed to live up to}} the previous games in the series. More charitably, GamePros Peter Olafson wrote: [...] "Populous: The Beginning <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> game, in fact a good one; but it's a different game—one without a quintessential quality that defined Populous." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the critics}} were divided on Rihanna's {{decision}} to collaborate with Brown again. Toronto Stars Lucas Oleniuk stated that [...] "Nobody's Business" [...] <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> track, [...] "it’s one of the catchiest and freshest-sounding here — but the troubling subtext is as irksome as the irony of titling a song that proudly makes the pair’s business everybody's." [...] Bernard Perusse of Montreal Gazette noted that although it is a pretty fair R smoker, there is something nauseating and sinister about the song and that is its message. Being more critical towards the collaboration, Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times wrote that the track represents a sad inversion of the 1965 single [...] "I Got You Babe" [...] by Sonny & Cher, further noting [...] " [...] Instead of singing about connection, true love and wanting to shout it to the world, the song features a convicted abuser and the woman he assaulted asking everyone to shut up and leave them alone." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{his first}} day of filming, in July 2006, Thompson—who grew up {{watching}} Coronation Street—was starstruck. [...] " [...] was the strangest {{day of my life}} because I was in a room with all these famous people." [...] He added: [...] "It was completely different to how I imagined it would be. Everyone's been really nice to me and it's going well." [...] Prior to the airing of the Connor family's arrival on the famous cobblestone street in August 2006, Thompson commented, [...] "I can't say too much about Ryan and the story lines, but he's very mischievous. The character <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> lad, but he's not a good lad either." [...] Garth Philips, series producer, said at the time, [...] "We held extensive casting sessions to get this family right, and the energy that Sean, Rob, Kym and Ben have will certainly make them a joy to watch on screen." [...] He continued, [...] "They're a twenty-first century Coronation Street family, and we hope our viewers will be as enthralled and excited by them as we are." ...|$|E

500|$|However, {{the film}} was not without its detractors. Richard Roeper gave the film a C+, saying [...] "This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets." [...] Stephen Whitty of Newark Star-Ledger gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and said [...] "The artwork is accomplished, and intricate. The G-rating is genuine, without any gross-out gags. And there's none of the usual winks to the adults with tired, pop-culture references." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote [...] "Both the {{originality}} and stirring emotional complexity of Monsters, Inc., with its exquisitely painful and touching parallels with the human world, are missing." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and said [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> movie, and to small children {{it will be a}} very good one, but it's closer to average than one would wish from the company that gave us Up, WALL-E, The Incredibles, and the Toy Story series." [...] Rene Rodriguez of Miami Herald gave the film two stars out of five and wrote that it [...] "feels half-hearted and lazy, like they weren't even trying. At least show a little effort, guys." ...|$|E
500|$|Aadisht Khanna from Mint praised Tripathi's {{portrayal}} of Shiva in the book, complimenting {{the fact that}} he was able to successfully deliver the humane side of his characters, and their emotions and motivations. He also pointed out that Tripathi's experimentation with Indian Scriptures, has been successful in transforming an otherwise mundane genre, [...] "long overdue in popular literature, especially by an Indian author". However, he was disappointed in the weak dialogue and the grammatical errors scattered throughout the book, especially the inclusion of [...] "glaringly out-of-place world" [...] words, thus having too many anachronism in the book. Rito Paul from Daily News and Analysis shared Khanna's opinion, while saying that the book [...] "is impressive in its conception. But it is executed poorly. [...] "We're thrust into the narrative, mid-action, exactly from where the first book ended. And the breathless pace of the action hardly ever lets up... There are more twists and turns than in a Gordian knot, and at least two revelations of the 'Luke-I-am-your-father' variety... And it really rankles, because there is so much scope for flair, adventure and wonder in the world Tripathi has imagined... The Secrets <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> book. The plot holds your attention and the story races along, but the writing veers between the pedestrian and the ridiculous. Tripathi is an excellent story-teller. But he is a poor writer." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Allistair Pinsof at Destructoid {{reviewed}} the game, {{calling it a}} mix between Paperboy and Muscle March {{in terms of the}} complexity and pace, and compared the gameplay to Crash Bandicoot. He found it to be [...] "such a gloriously twisted, charming spectacle" [...] that it would be difficult not to like it; he said that the main reason to play the game is [...] "the sheer lunacy" [...] of it, saying that the game is [...] "obsessed" [...] with America, and portrays Americans as [...] "unhygienic hillbillies" [...] in a manner that makes it unclear if it is a self-aware parody or not. He concluded that the game is funny, but not great, and that the ridiculous premise and its large amount of small details make the game [...] "charmingly brain-dead". In 2013, Justin Amirkhani at Complex included the game in a list of company-branded video games that [...] "didn't suck", saying that while the game's graphics had not aged well, it was mechanically very similar to Temple Run, which Amirkhani called his favorite iOS game. He concluded that Pepsiman <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> game for people with quick reflexes, {{as long as they can}} stand the high amount of advertising within the game; he claimed that Pepsiman was the advergame with the largest amount of [...] "logos-per-second".|$|E

500|$|Most critics felt KMFDM {{stayed close}} to its usual sound on WTF?!. [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic commented, [...] "The 'ultra heavy beat' sounds as 'ultra' and 'heavy' as ever on WTF?!" [...] He {{went on to say}} the album was [...] "an {{outstanding}} blast of dark dancefloor destruction" [...] and saying the album should be on [...] "the top shelf". [...] Gregory Burkart of FearNet mostly praised the album, saying that while the band doesn't [...] "break new creative ground" [...] on WTF?!, which he said wasn't the [...] "heaviest, fastest or most experimental album", it was [...] "still rock-solid, sporting some outstanding melodies and rhythms, and many memorable moments". [...] Ilker Yücel of ReGen Magazine called WTF?! a [...] "hard-hitting dose of industrial rock that is as familiar as it is unusual". [...] He concluded his review by saying, [...] "In short, it’s KMFDM by-the-numbers, and after 27 years, that's not a bad thing at all." [...] Mark von Pfeiffer of Magnetic said, [...] "WTF? is typical: electronic used to augment electric to over-human speeds and volumes, outrageous claims made in the 3rd-person". [...] He also thought the album was more accessible, saying, [...] "This is industrial, but edible for most anyone looking for a bit of roughage on their playlist." [...] Petra Whiteley of Reflections of Darkness called WTF?! [...] "a solid release bursting with power and determination". [...] She also said of KMFDM, [...] "musically they are not far of their centre and typical sound, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing".|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of Real Adventures {{featured}} J. D. Roth as Jonny, George Segal as Dr. Quest, Robert Patrick as Race, Jesse Douglas as Jessie, Michael Benyaer as Hadji, and veteran voice actor Frank Welker as Dr. Jeremiah Surd. A childhood {{fan of the}} original series, J.D. Roth was inspired by Turner's vision for the new series and swiftly accepted the role of Jonny. Roth was attracted by Jonny's [...] "star quality", and approved of his characterization as a real kid without superpowers. He enjoyed Jonny's infectious enthusiasm and impulsive alacrity. Roth also admired the show's educational quality, something {{he had tried to}} integrate in his personal television pilots. When asked about how he played the relationship with Jonny's father, he commented, [...] "Jonny is crazy about his dad. He looks up to him and thinks he is the smartest man ever to walk to face of the earth. He has the typical teenage relationship with his father, but his father definitely sees something in him. Dr. Quest knows that Jonny is going to be something really special." [...] Michael Benyaer also enjoyed playing Hadji: [...] " [...] {{is one of the few}} roles for an ethnic actor that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> guy. I mean, how many East Indian heroes have been on television? Hadji is for the sensitive kids out there. He is the outsider in all of us." [...] A Star Wars fan, Benyaer was happy to work with Mark Hamill for [...] "In the Realm of the Condor". Peter Lawrence's request for an Indian-descended voice actor was seen as an [...] "unusual case of multi-ethnic casting".|$|E
500|$|Reacting to The Killing Joke and Barbara Gordon's later {{character}} development as Oracle in Batman: Gotham Knights, Ray Tate, a reviewer at Comics Bulletin, wrote [...] "here {{is absolutely no}} reason why Barbara Gordon {{should be in a}} wheelchair. Alan Moore and Brian Bolland meant The Killing Joke as an imaginary tale dealing with the iconography of Batman and the Joker... himself is a certifiable genius in biochemistry. There are countless examples of Batman employing that which is only theoretical in his fight against crime. His knowledge of stem cell technology should surpass that of the real world. There is simply no reason for Barbara Gordon to be confined to that wheelchair." [...] Regarding her representation as a character living with a disability, and her effectiveness as a hero compared to her incarnation as Batgirl, Tate asserts [...] "t's ridiculous to think somebody wakes up thinking how lucky they are to be confined to a wheelchair, and yet the attitude around DC and among the fans is that Oracle is the better character over Batgirl because of her handicap. Rubbish. Batgirl has fought more crime and done more to aid Batman as Batgirl than she has as Oracle. Batgirl has saved Batman's life on numerous occasions. Oracle has not. Barbara in this incarnation <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> character, but she is not better because she no longer hunts the night in cape and cowl." [...] In an article for Bitch magazine entitled [...] "The Cold Shoulder: Saving Superheroines from Comic-book Violence", Shannon Cochran noted a long history of inequality regarding the treatment of female heroes. She quotes Gail Simone, who discussed the gender difference regarding the treatment of Batman and Batgirl regarding paralysis: [...] "Both had their backs broken [...] Less than a year later, Batman was fine. Batgirl—now named Oracle—was in a wheelchair and remained so for many years.” ...|$|E

500|$|Upon the video's release, several {{media outlets}} noticed a {{resemblance}} between the colorful aesthetics of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] {{and those of}} British singer-songwriter and rapper M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz". Melina Matsoukas responded to the allegations that she had copied the idea, and said, [...] "Afterward I was like, 'Oh, this sucks. They tore down my video... video's great too. It definitely wasn't trying to rip anybody off at all, it was just our approach and the animation stuff, it had a similar vibe." [...] Matsoukas explained that {{the inspiration for the}} video did not come from one particular source, but from a variety of pop culture icons. She concluded, [...] "We're all inspired by similar elements and it came together in that way." [...] Several critics noticed the differences between Rihanna's previous singles, [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "Hard", and that [...] "Rude Boy" [...] had adopted a care-free and brighter image. Becky Bain of Idolator also noticed the similarities between M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy", and wrote, [...] "We're digging the reggae-inflected jam, although the Bob Marley-meets-M.I.A. color explosion becomes a little hard on the eyes after awhile." [...] Bain said the video [...] "is colorful, loud, vibrant, and a complete departure from the mostly depressing captivity scenarios and over-the-top war imagery of the previous videos from her Rated R singles." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly also commented on the vibrancy of the video and its resemblance to M.I.A.'s video, [...] "It's a wild explosion of clashing colors, bold block lettering, and shaky camerawork. As many observers instantly pointed out, it all owes more than a little to the aesthetic of M.I.A.which, if you ask me, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing at all." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV commented on the change of visual direction in the video, calling it [...] "a colorful departure from the dark fare previously released from her Rated R album." [...] Vena also wrote about the stylization of the video's content with regard to Rihanna's heritage. She wrote that the video is infused with [...] "a kaleidoscope of prints and colors, embracing her roots in Caribbean dance-hall-inspired costumes." ...|$|E
