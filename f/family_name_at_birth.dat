5000|$|Charles à Court {{was born}} at Heytesbury, Wiltshire in 1858, where {{his father was a}} Conservative Party Member of Parliament. His <b>family</b> <b>name</b> <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> was à Court; in his memoirs, he later wrote: [...] "The à Courts are Wiltshire folk, and in old days {{represented}} Heytesbury in Parliament... The name of Repington, under the terms of an old will, was assumed by all the à Courts in turn as they succeeded to the Amington Hall Estate, and I followed the rule when my father died in 1903." [...] His rich upper-class background may well have contributed to the confidence with which he later criticised senior generals and politicians.|$|E
40|$|Many cancer {{predisposition}} syndromes {{are rare}} or have incomplete penetrance, and traditional epidemiological tools {{are not well}} suited for their detection. Here we have used an approach that employs the entire population based data in the Finnish Cancer Registry (FCR) for analyzing familial aggregation {{of all types of}} cancer, in order to find evidence for previously unrecognized cancer susceptibility conditions. We performed a systematic clustering of 878, 593 patients in FCR based on <b>family</b> <b>name</b> <b>at</b> <b>birth,</b> municipality of birth, and tumor type, diagnosed between years 1952 and 2011. We also estimated the familial occurrence of the tumor types using cluster score that reflects the proportion of patients belonging to the most significant clusters compared to all patients in Finland. The clustering effort identified 25, 910 birth name-municipality based clusters representing 183 different tumor types characterized by topography and morphology. We produced information about familial occurrence of hundreds of tumor types, and many of the tumor types with high cluster score represented known cancer syndromes. Unexpectedly, Kaposi sarcoma (KS) also produced a very high score (cluster score 1. 91, p-value < 0. 0001). We verified from population records that many of the KS patients forming the clusters were indeed close relatives, and identified one family with five affected individuals in two generations and several families with two first degree relatives. Our approach is unique in enabling systematic examination of a national epidemiological database to derive evidence of aberrant familial aggregation of all tumor types, both common and rare. It allowed effortless identification of families displaying features of both known as well as potentially novel cancer predisposition conditions, including striking familial aggregation of KS. Further work with high-throughput methods should elucidate the molecular basis of the potentially novel predisposition conditions found in this study. Public Library of Science open acces...|$|E
