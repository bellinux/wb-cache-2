40|$|At the La Tapy Experimental Station {{in southeastern}} France, {{a plot of}} table grapes is managed {{according}} {{to the principles of}} organic farming in order to study potential technical impediments of this growing system compared to another plot that is managed according to the principles of sustainable agriculture. Muscat de Hambourg, the variety common to these two plots, is used as a reference for the different observations. Results are primarily related to the impact of pest management efficiency on vine quality. The qualitative requirement that powdery mildew be absent on table grapes is difficult to fulfil in the case of organic farming, even with several different treatments and frequent applications. Botrytis management is related to climatic conditions; disease prevention is therefore essential. Small populations of grapeberry moths (Lobesia botrana) and the absence of <b>grape</b> <b>bud</b> <b>moths</b> (Eupoecilia ambiguella) on those plots, as well as the efficacy of specific treatments, even in the context of biological control, using products containing Bacillus thuringiensis, led to either none or negligible damage on the two observed plots. Monitoring of grape leaf hopper populations (Empoasca vitis) revealed that there was no increase in the larva population. The stable level of auxiliaries on this plot partially explains the low incidence of Empoasca vitis...|$|R

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{patterns}} of cyclic larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth</b> population densities, for instance synchrony (valley scale) and travelling waves (Alpine arc scale), {{have been observed}} at different scales and maybe related to distinct causes. In this study, quantification of population data through cross-correlation analysis and spectral analysis revealed that larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth</b> population cycles at the valley scale could {{be considered to be}} in close synchrony with one another. At the Alpine arc scale the presence of travelling waves could generally be confirmed. These results have implications for the understanding of the causal mechanisms behind the observed spatio-temporal patterns, suggesting that at the valley scale synchrony depends not only on distances between subpopulations, but is also affected by environmental/habitat characteristics that vary in space. At the Alpine scale, distance between populations is of greater importance in shaping spatio-temporal patterns than at the valley scale...|$|R

40|$|To {{elucidate}} promoting and inhibiting {{effects of}} hydrogen cynamide (HC) and abscisic acid (ABA) on quiescence release of <b>grape</b> <b>buds,</b> physiological and molecular approaches {{were used to}} explore the mechanisms of quiescence based on metabolic and gene expression analysis. Physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in <b>bud</b> quiescence of <b>grape</b> were studied before and after application of HC, ABA, and ABA-HC. The data showed that ABA inhibited proclamation of quiescence in <b>grape</b> <b>buds</b> and attenuated the influence of HC. Bud quiescence was promoted and regulated by HC and ABA pre-treatment on <b>buds</b> of <b>grape</b> cultivar “Shine Muscat” with 5 % HC, 100 μM ABA and combination of ABA-HC (5 % HC+ 100 μM ABA) during quiescence under forcing condition. Exogenous application of ABA elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) related specific activities, while catalase (CAT) activity was increased during initial period of forcing and then decreased. The concentration of plant growth hormones including gibberellins (GA) and indole acetic acid increased by HC application but decreased the ABA contents under forcing condition. ABA increased the fructose content during quiescence under forcing condition while sucrose and total soluble sugars peaked in HC treated buds as compared to control. Genes related to ABA pathway, protein phosphatase 2 C (PP 2 C family) were down regulated in the buds treated with HC, ABA and ABA-HC as compared to control while two genes related to GA pathway (GID 1 family), out of which one gene showed down regulation during initial period of forcing while other gene was up regulated in response to HC and ABA-HC treatments as compared to control. Exogenous ABA application up regulated genes related to antioxidant enzymes as compared to control. The gene probable fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 1, chloroplastic-like, was up regulated in response to ABA treatment as compared to control. Analysis of metabolites and related gene expression pattern would provide a comprehensive view of quiescence after HC, ABA, and ABA-HC treatments in <b>grape</b> <b>buds</b> which may helpful for ultimate improvement in table grape production...|$|R
40|$|Ideally {{studies on}} the {{population}} dynamics of organisms should be holistic, general, precise, and realistic (64). Much too often, however, support for research on forest pests approximates {{the curve of the}} gradations in time and space, resulting in periodic gathering of bits and pieces of information that differ little from that gathered earlier or elsewhere (68). Therefore {{it is not surprising that}} lack of compre hensive, quantitative information on many generations of a field population has handicapped the progress of theoretical thinking on the dynamics of populations, which badly needs "more light and less heat " (86). It has been proposed that research efforts should be coordinated internationally on a few model insects in order to cope with complexity and diversity of population dynamics at a high level of efficiency (25). We consider that the larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth,</b> Zeiraphera diniana, would meet the criteria for being such a model insect (18). The coincidence of large-scale insect outbreaks, the availability of effective insecti cides, and economic expansion of industry and tourism after World War II pro moted several extensive control actions against such forest pests as the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, in eastern Canada and the larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth,</b> Z. diniana, in Switzerland. Public demand to protect the subalpine larch forests in the recreation area of the Engadine (Switzerland) against the recurring defoliation by the larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth</b> triggered the present research phase. This article is the first attempt to publish the results of the research period (1949 - 1975) comprehensively. In addition, information concerning previous outbreaks of Z. diniana is reviewed on a worldwide base...|$|R
