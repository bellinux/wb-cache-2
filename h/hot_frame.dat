40|$|Abstract An {{absolute}} plate motion (APM) {{model is}} required to address {{issues such as the}} thermochemical evolution of Earth’s mantle. All APM models have to rely on indirect inferences, including those based on hot spots and seismic anisotropy, each with their own set of uncertainties. Here, we explore a seafloor spreading-aligned reference frame. We show that this reference frame fits azimuthal seismic anisotropy in the uppermost mantle very well. The corresponding Euler pole is close to those of <b>hot</b> spot reference <b>frames,</b> ridge motion minimizing models, and geodynamic estimates of net rotation and predicts clear trench motion patterns. We conclude that a net rotation pole guided by the spreading-aligned model (at 64 ∘E, 61 ∘S, with moderate rotation of ∼ 0. 2 … 0. 3 ∘/Myr) could indeed represent a standard, comprehensive reference frame for present-day plate motions with respect to the deep mantle. 1...|$|R

40|$|Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical UnionOver {{the last}} three decades the first-order {{correlation}} in morphology and orientation of seamount trails has been called upon to support the concept of a ‘‘fixed’’ Pacific <b>hot</b> spot <b>frame</b> of reference and to explain the Hawaii-Emperor bend (HEB) by a dramatic change in Pacific plate motion. In this paper, however, we present ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar ages for the Gilbert Ridge and Tokelau Seamounts (Pacific) that show similar changes or bends in their orientation, but at different geological times, up to 20 Myr earlier than the HEB. Changes in Pacific plate motion alone cannot explain these observations, because these asynchronous bends should have been reflected in the morphology of each of these seamount trails. Together with the lack of (linear) age progressions and inconsistent apparent local plate velocities of 131 and 87 mm/yr, we rule out a fixed hot spot origin for the Gilbert Ridge and Tokelau seamount trails. Instead we invoke secondary or alternate processes to explain the complex age systematics and morphologies in these seamount trails. We propose here that the HEB-type bends in these seamount trails were likely formed by short-term ‘‘jerk-like’’ plate extensions in the studied southwestern region of the Pacific plate, reactivating a preconditioned lithosphere that can be characterized by a complex structure and precursory magmatic impingements. The remarkable differences observed in these colinear seamount trails fundamentally question the existence of HEB-type bends in the formation of Pacific volcanic lineaments. They also show us that applying geometric and morphologic observations alone is insufficient in constraining past plate motions. Nevertheless, the need and search for alternate volcano-tectonic mechanisms offer opportunities to better understand intraplate volcanism in general...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinematics}} {{of plates}} {{is defined by}} Euler pole and angular velocity. However, during their journey, plates may be affected by additional simultaneous rotations (i. e., subrotations) while they are rotating about their Euler poles. The kinematic description of this particular plate motion requires a different analytical approach: two angular velocities and two poles are necessary to completely describe plate displacements. If a subrotation occurs, none of the points on a plate moves along circles of the Euler pole but, instead, follows cycloid trajectories because of {{the combination of the}} two simultaneous rotations. Regardless of the forces that move the lithosphere, every time a plate experiences a subrotation, an additional force (or resisting) force could act on the plate, generating the two-rotation motion. In the <b>hot</b> spot reference <b>frame,</b> we applied this model to the North America plate, investigating its past motion for a time interval Dt = 43 Ma up to the present and comparing results with those obtained by Gordon and Jurdy (1986).

This change is coincident {{with the onset of}} the India-Asia collision, and with a rearrangement of plate boundaries in the Indian Ocean. On the basis of a simple model for the forces exerted upon the edges of the plate and the tractions on the base of the plate, we perform force balance calculations for the precollision and postcollision configurations. We show that the observed Euler poles for the Indian plate are well explained in terms of their locations and magnitudes if (1) the resistive force induced by mountain building in the Himalaya-Tibet area is ~ 5 – 6 × 10 ^(12) N/m, (2) the net force exerted upon the Indian plate by subduction zones is similar in magnitude to the ridge-push force (~ 2. 5 × 10 ^(12) N/m), and (3) basal tractions exert a resisting force that is linearly proportional to the plate velocity in the <b>hot</b> spot reference <b>frame.</b> The third point implies an asthenospheric viscosity of ~ 2 – 5 × 10 ^(19) Pa s, assuming a thickness of 100 – 150 km.

40|$|Despite its importance, the {{temporal}} and spatial evolution of continental dynamic topography is poorly known. Australia's isolation from active plate boundaries and its rapid northward motion within a <b>hot</b> spot reference <b>frame</b> make it a useful place to investigate the interplay between mantle convection, topography, and drainage. Offshore, dynamic topography is relatively well constrained and can {{be accounted for by}} Australia's translation over the mantle's convective circulation. To build a database of onshore constraints, we have analyzed an inventory of longitudinal river profiles, which is sensitive to uplift rate history. Using independently constrained erosional parameters, we determine uplift rates by minimizing the misfit between observed and calculated river profiles. Resultant fits are excellent and calculated uplift histories match independent geologic constraints. We infer that western and central Australia underwent regional uplift during the last 50 Myr and that the Eastern Highlands have been uplifted in two stages. The first stage from 120 to 80 Ma, coincided with rifting along the eastern margin and its existence is supported by thermochronological measurements. A second stage occurred at 80 – 10 Ma, formed the Great Escarpment, and coincided with Cenozoic volcanism. The relationship between topography, gravity anomalies, and shear wave tomographic models suggest that regional elevation is supported by temperature anomalies within the lithosphere's thermal boundary layer.

To increase awareness of the benefits these units provided, infant incubators containing premature babies were displayed at the 1897, 1898, 1901, and 1904 World Fairs. This piece of medical equipment helped neonates with compromised immune systems by providing a sanitary environment to {{reduce the likelihood of}} acquiring an infection. Each incubator was an air-tight glass box with a metal <b>frame.</b> <b>Hot</b> air was pumped into the container to keep a constant temperature. Newspapers advertised the incubators with [...] "lives are being preserved by this wonderful method." [...] During the World Fair in 1904, E. M. Bayliss brought these devices for exhibition on The Pike where approximately ten nurses cared for twenty-four neo-natal babies while in the infant incubators. The exhibit required an entrance fee of twenty-five cents and visitors could also purchase souvenirs and refreshments from the adjoining shop and café. These proceeds, totaling $181,632, helped to fund Bayliss's project. There were some setbacks with the infant incubator display as the sanitary conditions were not always consistent and some babies died of illness. The incubator area was then modified by installing glass walls to separate the babies from visitors, thus decreasing the exposure of the infants. The science and technology behind the incubators has since been expanded upon. Now known as [...] "isolettes," [...] these units are a vital component to caring for neonates in modern neonatal intensive care units.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{anomalous}} Cretaceous vertical motion of Australia and distinctive geochemistry and geophysics of the Australian-Antarctic Discordance (AAD) were caused by a subducted slab which migrated beneath the continent during the Cretaceous, stalled within the mantle transition zone, and is presently being drawn up by the Southeast Indian Ridge. During the Early Cretaceous the eastern interior of the Australian continent rapidly subsided, but must have later uplifted on a regional scale. Beneath the AAD the mantle is cooler than normal, as indicated {{by a variety of}} observations. Seismic tomography shows an oblong, slab-like structure orientated N-S in the transition zone and lower mantle, consistent with an old subducted slab. Using a three-dimensional model of mantle convection with imposed plate tectonics, we show that both of these well documented features are related. The models start with slabs dipping toward the restored eastern Australian margin. As Australia moves east in a <b>hot</b> spot reference <b>frame</b> from 130 - 90 Ma, a broad dynamic topography depression of decreasing amplitude migrates west across the continent causing the continent to subside and then uplift. Most of the slab descends into the deeper mantle, but the models show part of the cooler mantle becomes trapped within the transition zone. From 40 Ma to the present, wisps of this cool mantle are drawn up by the northwardly migrating ridge between Australia and Antarctica. This causes a circular dynamic topography depression and thinner crust to develop at the present position of the AAD. The AAD is unique within the ocean basins because it is the only place where a modern ridge has migrated over the position of long term Mesozoic subduction.

For two of these sections, preliminary (; 40;Ar/; 39;Ar) ages are reported to aid in the calibration of the paleomagnetic results. The primary contribution of this report, however, is a compilation of these new data with those already published in order to describe statistically the characteristics of the paleomagnetic field as recorded by the Kerguelen flood basalts. In total, 258 paleomagnetic directions sampled at 13 stratigraphic sections through the lava pile are available and span an approximately 5 Ma window: from 25 to 30 Ma. The composite section represents at least 11 polarity zones that are correlated to the reference geomagnetic polarity timescale. Our approach is to investigate the average normal and reversed polarity field directions over this 5 Ma window. We calculated a paleomagnetic pole found to be located at;λ; = 85. 5 °N, = 189. 3 °E (A; 95; = 2. 3 °, K = 16. 5, N = 233).

40|$|From late Cretaceous {{to present}} time, an {{extensive}} magmatic activity developed both in Europe and northern Africa, showing a progressive transition with time from calc-alkaline to Na-rich alkaline features in areas tightly connected with subduction systems (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Spain, western Italy), while Na-rich basalts and basanites, with minor tholeiitic volcanics, occur at extensional tectonic settings, both associated {{or not to}} orogenic dynamics (Valencia trough, Pannonian, Alboran, Tyrrhenian, and Aegean basins, Pantelleria-Etna-Iblean area, Veneto Province, Cenozoic Rift System). The widespread alkaline magmatism in the European and circum Mediterranean area shows a uniform OIB-HIMU-type signature which has been previously ascribed to a plume-related european astenospheric reservoir (EAR) standing at less than 400 km depth in the upper mantle (Wilson and Downes, 1991). In the same area a large low seismic velocity zone below 900 km depth is evident by tomographic images from whole mantle models. The mantle transition zone under central-western Europe and Mediterranean is instead characterized by a high velocity anomaly, while the top most mantle is again dominated by a low-velocity zone {{on a large scale}} (Goes et al., 1999; Piromallo and Morelli, 2003). The origin of this mantle geochemical/geophysical anomaly has been related to the Mesozoic super-plume activity centered at Madeira-Canary-Cape Verde (MCCV), where the HIMU component appears to have its purest fingerprint (Hoernle et al., 1995; Wilson, 1997; Oyarzun et al., 1997; Gasperini et al., 2003). Achievable interpretations of any relationship between present seismic anomalies and alkaline magmatism in this wide area are restricted to recent time (Hoernle et al., 1995; Goes et al., 1999), since older geochemical and geophysical features depend on the paleo-position of each magmatic center toward the south-west. Assuming that a common and primary mantle plume has been upwelling beneath the present MCCV since at least 65 - 70 Ma, using a <b>hot</b> spot reference <b>frame,</b> we projected that in the early Cenozoic the theoretical positions of the European magmatic centers might outline the old plume head size.

40|$|The geochemical {{properties}} of the SE Alps volcanics (SEAV, Eocene age) call for a plume-related origin of the most primitive basalts {{in contrast to the}} widespread calc-alkaline magmatism which developed some million years later northwestwards along the Periadriatic Lineament. The two contrasting magmatic suites define binary mixing relationships in the Sr-Nd and Pb-Pb isotopic space, the two end members being represented by a lower crustal component, and a HIMU-DM component (the SEAV). The latter shows geochemical features comparable to the numerous magmatic provinces of Tertiary-Quaternary age from the western Mediterranean area for which a plume-related origin has been assessed. The occurrence of a HIMU component, which is the hallmark of hotspot basalts, in a tectonic regime dominated by collision tectonics (the Tertiary convergence of Europe and Africa plates) is an intriguing feature. Here, we combine tectonic reconstruction, plate motion and tomographic images to unravel the evolution of the Alps-Apenninic slabs and their interaction with the plume, at the scale of the upper mantle. Our result shows that the plume could have been captured and detached from its deeper root by the Alpine-Apennine subducting slab during the Paleogene. This model can explain the lack of evident track of the plume on the surface during the northward drift of Europe (<b>hot</b> spot reference <b>frame).</b> The latest evolutionary stage of the system is signed by the break of the Alpine slab that can definitively have trapped the plume material. Evidence for the European slab breakoff comes from seismic tomography which shows that the present-day fast velocity feature, interpreted as the European slab subducted below the Alpine chain, is shorter by about 300 km than the total length of the subducted slab estimated by paleotectonic reconstructions. Slab detachment and ensuing upwelling of deep mantle material through the lithospheric gap is proposed as a viable mechanism for HIMU-type basalt extrusions in SE Alps as well as in other subduction zones of the western Mediterranean area. Interactions between the HIMU component and the shallower depleted mantle may account for the geochemical characteristics of the SEAV. Counterflows of plume material towards the top of the subducting slab may also induce heating and partial melting in the overriding mantle wedge, giving rise to the tholeiitic basalts often bordering the Periadriatic intrusions. Upwelling of these basalts and their underplating at the mantle-lower crust interface could cause partial melting in the latter and generate the widespread tonalitic-trondhjemitic-granodioritic associations observed along the Periadriatic Lineament...|$|R
