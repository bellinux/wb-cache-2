25|$|In 1914, a {{downtown}} redevelopment plan based on City Beautiful movement principles {{led to the}} construction of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad's (D) new headquarters, today the State University of New York (SUNY) System Administration Building. The Flemish Gothic edifice by local architect Marcus T. Reynolds, closely copied from the Cloth Hall in Ypres, Belgium, {{was meant to be a}} focal point for traffic coming down <b>from</b> <b>Capitol</b> <b>Hill</b> to the west via State Street. To further this goal, the industrial structures along the riverfront behind it were demolished.|$|E
500|$|Preparation {{work for}} station {{construction}} began in January 2010, with {{the closure of}} East Denny Way and erection of construction walls around the site. The [...] high wall was painted red and adorned with public artwork by local street artists {{over the course of}} the five-year construction period. Excavation of the station box began in July, and reached the future platform level in December. In June 2011, the first of three tunnel boring machines, named [...] "Brenda", was launched <b>from</b> <b>Capitol</b> <b>Hill</b> toward Westlake station in Downtown Seattle. A separate pair of machines, [...] "Balto" [...] and [...] "Togo", were launched from University of Washington station at the same time and arrived at Capitol Hill station in March and April 2012.

2500|$|South of the Ship Canal Bridge Interstate 5 {{separates}} the Eastlake and Cascade neighborhoods <b>from</b> the <b>Capitol</b> <b>Hill</b> neighborhood, and separates Downtown Seattle <b>from</b> the <b>Capitol</b> <b>Hill</b> and First Hill neighborhoods. Its construction necessitated {{the demolition of}} significantly developed areas and cut off walking commutes to downtown for many First Hill residents, who [...] "were {{by far the most}} vociferous critics of the proposed route," [...] but far from the only ones. Architect Paul Thiry said in the early 1970s, [...] "It was with the Freeway, cutting through {{the very heart of the}} city, that Seattle began taking one of its wrong turns and started to lose its identity as a city." [...] He proposed a lid extending from Columbia Street north to Olive Way, roughly the entire length of downtown.|$|R

25|$|With Langston Golf Course {{closed for}} the third time in 10 years, District of Columbia highway {{officials}} argued the land should be used for a new bridge across the Anacostia River. The Barney Circle Freeway would at last be built (they claimed) to bring the Southeast Freeway north along the west bank of the Anacostia River, through Anacostia Park and Langston Golf Course, and then travel over the new bridge to connect with the Anacostia Freeway. But widespread protests <b>from</b> wealthy <b>Capitol</b> <b>Hill</b> residents, numerous lawsuits, and design changes caused the freeway's cost to balloon to $160 million, and it remained unbuilt by 1992. The D.C. City Council had the final say on whether to proceed with the project or not. In December 1994, the City Council bowed to neighborhood opposition and voted overwhelmingly to cancel the Barney Circle Freeway.|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In April 2007, GAO reported that 96 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions <b>from</b> the <b>Capitol</b> <b>Hill</b> Complex facilities [...] managed by the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) [...] resulted from electricity use throughout the complex and combustion of fossil fuels in the Capitol Power Plant. The report concluded that AOC and other legislative branch agencies could benefit from conducting energy audits to identify projects that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. GAO also recommended that AOC and the other agencies establish a schedule for conducting these audits and implement selected projects {{as part of an}} overall plan that considers cost-effectiveness, {{the extent to which the}} projects reduce emissions, and funding options. AOC and the other agencies agreed with our recommendations. This statement focuses on (1) the status of AOC's efforts to implement the recommendations in our April 2007 report and (2) opportunities for the Senate to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and associated environmental impacts. The statement is based on GAO's prior work, analysis of AOC documents, and discussions with AOC management. ...|$|R
50|$|New zoning {{ordinances}} {{based on}} the 1956 Comprehensive Plan of Seattle forbade any new residential uses in Cascade Neighborhood. The plan also recommended two new freeways through the area. On the northern edge, the Bay Freeway would cover roughly nine city blocks between Mercer and Valley Streets, with ramps connecting to the Aurora Freeway which had been constructed in 1932. The city lacked funding for the project and plans were eventually scrapped along with the R.H. Thomson Expressway. The second freeway was Interstate 5, which was constructed in 1962. More than seven blocks of residences and retail businesses {{on the east side}} of Eastlake were razed to make way for Interstate 5. The freeway cut Cascade off entirely <b>from</b> neighboring <b>Capitol</b> <b>Hill.</b> Previously they had been tied together by multiple streets and stairways. (The upper half-block of the E. Republican Street Stairway or Republican Hill Climb east of Melrose Ave E. remains east of the freeway, and has status as a city landmark; it once extended two blocks farther, down to Eastlake Ave E.) Currently, the only remaining direct route between the two is Denny Way at the south border of the neighborhood.|$|R
