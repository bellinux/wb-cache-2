40|$|In {{almost all}} {{production}} of electricity the rotating machines serves as {{an important part of}} the energy transformation system. In hydropower units, a hydraulic turbine connected to a generator converts the potential energy stored in the water reservoir into electrical energy in the generator. An essential part of this energy conversion is the rotating system of which the turbine and the generator are crucial parts. During the last century the machines for {{production of electricity}} have been developed from a few megawatts per unit, up to several hundreds megawatts per unit. The development and increased size of the hydropower machines has also brought a need for new techniques. The most important developments are the increased efficiency of the turbines and generators, new types of bearings and the introduction of new materials. Vibration measurement is still the most reliable and commonly used method for avoiding failure during commissioning, for periodic maintenance, and for protection of the systems. Knowledge of the bearing forces at different operational modes is essential in order to estimate the degeneration of components and to avoid failures. In the appended Paper A, a method has been described for measurement of bearing load by use of strain gauges installed on the guide bearing bracket. This technique can determine the magnitude and direction of both static and dynamic loads acting on the bearing. This method also makes it possible to find the cause of the radial bearing force among the various eccentricities and disturbances in the system. This method was used in Paper C to investigate bearing stiffness and damping. A principal cause of many failures in large electrical machines is the occurrence of high radial forces due to misalignment between rotor and stator, rotor imbalance or disturbance from the turbine. In this thesis, two rotor models are suggested for calculation of forces and moments acting on the generator shaft due to misalignment between stator and rotor. These two methods are described in appended papers B and D. In Paper B, a linear model is proposed for an eccentric generator rotor subjected to a radial magnetic force. Both the radial force and the bending moment affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the rotor spider hub deviates from the centre of the rotor rim. The magnetic force acting on the rotor is assumed to be proportional to the rotor displacement. In Paper D, a non-linear model is proposed for analysis of an eccentric rotor subjected to radial magnetic forces. Both the radial and bending moments affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the generator spider hub deviates from the centre of the generator rim. The magnetic forces acting on the rotor are assumed to be a non-linear function of the air-gap between the rotor and stator. The stability analysis shows that the rotor can become unstable for small initial eccentricities if the position of the rotor rim relative to the rotor hub is included in the analysis. The analysis also shows that natural frequencies can decrease and the rotor response can increase if the position of the rotor rim in relation to the rotor spider is considered. In Paper E, the effect of damping rods was included in the analysis of the magnetic pull force. The resulting force was found to be reduced significantly when the damper rods were taken into account. An interesting effect of the rotor damper rods was that they reduced the eccentricity forces and introduced a force component perpendicular to the direction of eccentricity. The results from the finite-element simulations were used to determine how the forces affect the stability of the generator rotor. Damped natural eigenfrequencies and the damping ratio for load and no-load conditions were investigated. When applying the forces computed in the time- dependent model, the damped natural eigenfrequencies were found to increase and the stability of the generator rotor was found to be reduced, compared with when the forces were computed in a stationary model. Damage due to contact between the runner and the <b>discharge</b> <b>ring</b> have been observed in several hydroelectric power units. The damage can cause high repair costs to the runner and the <b>discharge</b> <b>ring</b> as well as considerable production losses. In Paper F a rotor model of a 45 MW hydropower unit is used for the analysis of the rotor dynamical phenomena occurring due to contact between the runner and the <b>discharge</b> <b>ring</b> for different grades of lateral force on the turbine and bearing damping. The rotor model consists of a generator rotor and a turbine, which are connected to an elastic shaft supported by three isotropic bearings. The discrete representation of the rotor model consist of 32 degrees of freedom. To increase the speed of the analysis, the size of the model has been reduced with the IRS method to a system with 8 degrees of freedom. The results show that a small gap between the turbine and <b>discharge</b> <b>ring</b> can be dangerous, due to the risk of contact with high contact forces as a consequence. It has also been observed that backward whirl can occur and in some cases the turbine motion becomes quasi-periodic or chaotic. The endurance of hydropower rotor components is often associated with the dynamic loads acting on the rotating system and the number of start-stop cycles of the unit. Measurements, together with analysis of the rotor dynamics, are often the most powerful methods available to improve understanding of the cause of the dynamic load. The method for measurement of the bearing load presented in this thesis makes it possible to investigate the dynamic as well as the static loads acting on the bearing brackets. This can be done using the suggested method with high accuracy and without re-designing the bearings. During commissioning of a hydropower unit, measurement of shaft vibrations and forces is the most reliable methods for investigating the status of the rotating system. Generator rotor models suggested in this work will increase the precision of the calculated behaviour of the rotor. Calculation of the rotor behaviour is important before a generator is put in operation, after overhaul or when a new machine is to be installed. Godkänd; 2008; 20081111 (ysko...|$|E

40|$|For the {{compression}} of a cylindrical plasma by fast rising axial magnetic fields, the initial state of this plasma is {{of critical importance}} (1). Therefore experiments with a preheating discharge {{for the production of}} an initial plasma with known and reproducible properties were started at this laboratory simultaneously with the first experiments on {{the compression}} of a weakly preionized deuterium gas. An electrodeless <b>ring</b> <b>discharge</b> was chosen. The absence of electrodes makes a high degree of purity of the plasma possible. Kolb's experience with a preheating discharge for magnetic com-pression experiments (2) confirmed this conception and gave further impulse to this work. Early experiments were made with a RF-transmitter as current generator, in pulsed as weIl as in stationary operation. Dueto the low inductance of the compression coil considerable difficulties are met in coupling the RF power to the discharge. The maximum available power is limited to some hundred kilowatts. By discharging a low inductance condenser on the compression coil a damped RF pulse with apower of 100 M Watt is easily obtained. To avoid prefiring of the main condenser bank, the voltage of the coil must be lirnited. With the spark gaps used at this laboratory the maximum permissible voltage at the coil was about 5 kV. This voltage, however, is sufficient to start an electrodeless <b>ring</b> <b>discharge</b> in hydrogen. Investigations on this electrodeless <b>ring</b> <b>discharge</b> were made with and without a steady magnetic bias field in a wide pressure range.

40|$|The Voyager {{observations}} of electrical <b>discharges</b> in Saturn's <b>rings</b> strongly support earlier speculations {{on the role}} played by electrostatics, magnetic fields, and lightning phenomena in the primitive solar system. They also suggest conditions then by direct analogy rather than by extrapolating backwards through time from conditions now. The observed discharges show a pronounced 10 h periodicity, which suggests a source in Keplerian orbit at 1. 80 + or - 0. 01 Saturn radii. In that region, the B ring is thicker than optical depth 1. 8 for about 5, 000 km. At 1. 805 + or - 0. 001 Saturn radii, however, the ring is virtually transparent for a gap of width 200 m.

50|$|The grab {{has to be}} {{selected}} so that the combined weight of grab and contents does not exceed the grabbing safe working load of the crane. The mass of the contents depends upon {{the properties of the}} product being handled; its density, flow characteristics, angle of repose, lump/grain size, purity (e.g. is it wet or dry) and, in some cases, degree of settlement (e.g. a ship's cargo has compacted due to vibration, rolling, pitching and yawing over a long voyage). Most bulk-handling cranes are dedicated to a single product, but others will handle various materials and need a selection of grabs. Some applications (e.g. manganese ore) may also require the use of teeth fitted to the grab jaws to enable penetration. Other applications (e.g. rape seed) may require to be self-sealing and have offset lower jaws with serrated, angle cut side cutters to restrain easy-flow properties.When off-loading a ship, the grab may be more efficient if designed with a low-profile extended body which enables reaching under the ship's hatches, negating any need to centre the product with human and machinery access.The grab mechanism may be four rope, double rope, single rope <b>ring</b> <b>discharge,</b> single rope self-dumping, double chain, single chain self-dumping, single chain <b>ring</b> <b>discharge,</b> hydraulic or electro-hydraulic.Rope grabs have rope pulleys in both the upper and lower girders and close by drawing the closing rope(s) to shorten the gap between the two girders. The minimum diameter of the pulley is restricted by the ratio of the pulley diameter to the rope diameter, the strands of the wire rope being subjected to fatigue bending stresses if the pulley is too small, giving premature failure. The physical size of the pulleys then determines the size of the girders, then determining a break point between a four rope and a two rope design. The closing force at the shell jaws, and, inversely, the speed of closure, are determined by the number of pulleys on each closing rope in the two girders. The closing rope is fed into the grab mechanism through either a bellmouth or an arrangement of small rollers. The weight of the grab is supported by the holding rope(s) and pinned to the upper girder allowing some angular freedom. Holding and closing ropes require separate winding drums in the crane.The mechanism on chain grabs operates {{in the same way as}} on rope grabs. The chains are connected to ropes on the crane by (e.g. bordeaux) couplings which allow rotation. A linked chain requires a much small diameter pulley than the equivalent rope which makes a smaller, more compact, design of girder. Chains used on chain pulleys are less easily inspected for wear and fatigue than ropes which show outer strand deformation well before failure. Failure of a rope or chain is a very high severity (dangerous) hazard.|$|R

In the literature promising approaches for (i) the kinetics between sputtered material and reactive gas, (ii) the distribution of sputtered neutral particles as well as (iii) flow kinetics of diluted gas within complex recipient geometries can be found. However, these approaches do not comprise the current-voltage characteristics at the sputter target.

Background: Oscillatory {{activity in}} high-beta and gamma bands (20 - 80 Hz) {{is known to}} play an important role in cortical processing being linked to cognitive processes and behavior. Beta/gamma oscillations are thought to emerge in local cortical circuits via two mechanisms: the interaction between excitatory principal cells and inhibitory interneurons – the pyramidal-interneuron gamma (PING) [1], and in networks of coupled inhibitory interneurons under tonic excitation – the interneuronal gamma (ING) [2]. Experimental evidence underlines the important role of inhibitory interneurons and especially of the fast spiking (FS) interneurons [3, 4]. We show in simulation that an important property of FS neurons, namely the membrane resonance (frequency preference), represents an additional mechanism – the resonance induced gamma (RING), i. e. modulation of oscillatory <b>discharge</b> by resonance. <b>RING</b> promotes frequency stability and enables oscillations in purely excitatory networks. Methods: Local circuits were modeled with small world networks of 80 % excitatory and 20 % inhibitory neuron populations interconnected in small-world topology by realistic conductance-based synapses. Neuron populations were leaky integrate and fire (LIF) or Izhikevich resonator (RES) neurons. We also tested networks of purely inhibitory and purely excitatory RES neurons. Networks were stimulated with miniature postsynaptic potentials (MINIs) [5] and with low frequency sinusoidal (0. 5 Hz) input that mimics the effect of gratings passing trough the visual field. The activity was calibrated to match recordings from cat visual cortex (firing rate, oscillatory activity). Results: Sinusoidal input modulates network oscillation frequency. This effect is most prominent in IF excitatory and IF inhibitory (IF-IF) networks and less prominent (about 4 times) in IF-RES or RES-IF networks where frequency remains relatively stable. The most stable frequency was observed in networks of pure resonators (RES-RES, None-RES, RES-None). Interestingly, purely excitatory RES networks (RES-None) were also able to exhibit oscillations through RING. By contrast purely excitatory or inhibitory IF networks (IF-None, None-IF) were not able to express oscillations under these conditions, matching experimental parameters. Conclusions: In both PING and ING, adding membrane resonance to principal cells or inhibitory interneurons stabilizes network oscillation frequency via the RING mechanism. Notably, in networks of purely excitatory networks, where ING and PING are not defined, oscillations can emerge via the RING mechanism if membrane resonance is expressed. Thus, RING appears as a potentially important mechanism for promoting stable network oscillations...|$|R
