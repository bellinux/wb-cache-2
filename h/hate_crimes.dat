5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} Middle Eastern were {{as likely to be}} victims of <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> against people who may have been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E

The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. <b>Hate</b> <b>Crimes</b> Prevention Act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hate</b> <b>crime</b> {{as an area}} {{of justice}} and social policy has a {{relatively}} recent history, although it's not a new phenomenon. Drawing on evidence primarily from the United Kingdom and United States, this chapter examines four issues of particular salience to understanding <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> victimization policy and practice: how <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> is defined; how <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> is measured; why victims under-report <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> and how to encourage victims to report; {{and the effectiveness of}} services for <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> victims. It concludes by offering a whole system model of support for <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> victims that spans the victim's journey before, during and after the end of their engagement with the criminal justice system...|$|R

He then proceeded to toss books around and smear the mixture on objects in the building. The man, identified by police as Mahoud Samed Almahadin, was charged with burglary, criminal mischief, and aggravated harassment as <b>hate</b> <b>crimes.</b> Two weeks later, 21-year-old film student and Anonymous member Jacob Speregen was charged with aggravated harassment and criminal mischief as <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> after he filmed Almahadin carrying out his prank.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} the All Wales <b>Hate</b> <b>Crime</b> Project. Most <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> {{research has focused on}} discrete victim-types in isolation. For the first time internationally this paper examines the psychological and physical impacts of <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> across seven victim-types drawing on quantitative and qualitative data. It contributes to the <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> debate in two significant ways: i) it provides the first look at the problem in Wales; and ii) it provides the first multi-victim-type analysis of <b>hate</b> <b>crime,</b> showing that impacts are not homogenous across victim groups.

40|$|Grounded {{in group}} {{conflict}} {{theory and the}} defended neighborhoods thesis, this nationwide empirical study of cities and their residential segregation levels examines the occurrence of <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> using data for all U. S. cities with populations over 95, 000 and Uniform Crime Reporting data for <b>hate</b> <b>crime,</b> in conjunction with 2000 census data. <b>Hate</b> <b>crime</b> is any illegal act motivated by pre-formed bias against, in this case, a person’s real or perceived race. This research asks: Do <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> levels predict white/black segregation levels? How does <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> predict different measures of white/black segregation? I use the dissimilarity index measure of segregation operationalized as a continuous, binary, and ordinal variable, to explore whether <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> predicts segrega- tion of blacks from whites. In cities with higher rates of <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> there was higher dissimilarity between whites and blacks, controlling for other factors. The segregation level {{was more likely to}} be “high” in a city where <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> occurred. Blacks are continually multiply disadvantaged and distinctly affected by <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> and residential segregation. Prior studies of residential segregation have focused almost exclusively on individual choice, residents’ lack of finances, or discriminatory actions that prevent racial minorities from moving, to explore the correlates of segregation. Notably absent from these studies are measures reflecting the level of <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> occurring in cities. This study demonstrates the importance of considering <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> and neighborhood conflict when contemplating the causes of residential segregation...|$|R

Clark stops him before he disrupts a local multicultural festival. In Buried Secrets Clark and Lex {{fall in love with}} a mind-reading substitute Spanish teacher, jeopardizing their friendship.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{incidents}} of harassment and <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> against Muslims and South Asians {{were reported in}} the days following the attacks. Sikhs were also targeted because Sikh males usually wear turbans, which are stereotypically associated with Muslims. There were reports of attacks on mosques and other religious buildings (including the firebombing of a Hindu temple), and assaults on people, including one murder: Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh mistaken for a Muslim, was fatally shot on September 15, 2001, in Mesa, Arizona.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to answer}} the question: can the {{aspiration}} for increasing <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> reporting contained in the United Kingdom Government's action plan on <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> (2016 - 2020) be achieved by local agencies in England and Wales? Drawing on findings from research into the barriers to <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> reporting and research undertaken by the authors and colleagues in 2012 to 2013 in a county in England, this paper will {{examine the impact of}} victim decision making and the efficacy of third party <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> reporting centres on <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> reporting. It will propose two solutions to facilitate increased reporting in the UK and other jurisdictions: an end to end, criminal justice system, <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> service framework to more effectively support victims; and a typology of reporting provision which will better enable commissioning agencies to assess the capability and capacity of <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> services...|$|R
40|$|Scholarship on <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> in U. S. neighborhoods has yet {{to learn}} from Los Angeles; this {{dissertation}} addresses that empirical gap and provides theoretical assessment of what <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> law has wrought {{over the last three}} decades in California and the United States. The picture is generally of expansion and then decline in use, while the best evidence shows that rates of <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> victimization remain unchanged. Originally conceived as a statistical monitoring system, <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> law currently monitors its own infrequent use by police across the United States. The system appears broken; public interest in and law enforcement use of <b>hate</b> <b>crime,</b> while mixed, has been at historically low levels until recently. Regression analyses of <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> in Los Angeles neighborhoods demonstrate the distinctive relationships between <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> and changing racial composition and economic characteristics in Los Angeles neighborhoods when compared to other cities covered in the scholarly literature. My analysis of anti-black <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> across Los Angeles from 2003 - 2014 provides evidence in favor of the argument that demographic change and economic inequality increase police reported <b>hate</b> <b>crime.</b> There are nuances to these relationships: neighborhoods with more black households moving into areas that are predominantly Latino or white neighborhood are associated with more <b>hate</b> <b>crime,</b> but only at certain tipping points for the percentage of households that are Latino or white. Income inequality makes a strong difference at moderately high levels, but models predict low numbers of anti-black <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> at low inequality and very high inequality...|$|R

In the original line-up, King, Hanneman and vocalist/bassist Tom Araya {{contributed to the}} band's lyrics, {{and all of the}} band's music was written by King, Hanneman and Lombardo. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, <b>hate</b> <b>crimes,</b> terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism and warfare, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically. Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold 4,900,000 albums in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Little {{published}} {{their next}} two books in April and June 2003. The first, Speed, had Clark fighting <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> in Smallville. The second, Buried Secrets, followed Clark and Lex as they both {{fell in love}} with a mind-reading, substitute Spanish teacher. In the novel, Clark and Lex's friendship was put in jeopardy as the two competed for the teacher's love. On September 9, 2004, Aspect published Shadows, where Clark must stop a girl's scientist father, who has created a monster that is killing people. Runaway featured Clark leaving Smallville and living on the streets of Metropolis with other homeless teenagers. Clark {{fell in love with}} one of the girls before eventually returning home. Smallville: Silence has Clark and his friends investigating the appearance of zombies. Little's Greed followed Clark and his friends as they took jobs as summer counselors to disadvantaged youths.

5|$|Despite DOMA, Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights. During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. Clinton also pushed for passing <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> laws for gays and {{for the private sector}} Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996. Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign. Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.|$|E
5|$|Spokane and its {{metro area}} in general, {{particularly}} northern Idaho has been stigmatized {{in the popular}} consciousness {{by a number of}} hate groups that have been set up in and around Coeur d'Alene, Idaho in the past. Low ethnic diversity made the region a destination for some seeking to escape more cosmopolitan cities for a locale with a relatively homogenous, white population. This trend increased with the arrival of retired engineer Richard Butler from California who traveled to Hayden, Idaho in 1974 to eventually establish a white supremacist church called the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, better known by its political arm, the Aryan Nations. Aryan Nations recruits and associates were responsible for several <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> and terror plots during the mid 1980s and 1990s. The group went defunct in 2000 when the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a civil suit which resulted in a $6.3 million settlement, which led to the eventual bankruptcy and closure of their Hayden compound. Another significant act of hate was the attempted bombing of Spokane's Martin Luther King Day Parade by Kevin Harpham of Addy, Washington in 2011. The Southern Poverty Law Center currently lists three hate groups in the Spokane and Coeur d'Alene metro areas, in the categories of anti-Muslim, Holocaust denial, and general hate.|$|E
5|$|Williamson {{and other}} members of Jamaica's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) community decided to form an organisation to campaign for their rights, resulting in the establishment of the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All Sexuals, and Gays (J-FLAG) in December 1998. J-FLAG sought to enhance LGBT rights through advocacy and encouraging legal reform, as well as through educational and social service programs. They also kept a record of anti-LGBT <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> including assaults, home invasions, and the corrective rape of lesbians, further recording the murder of 30 gay men between 1997 and 2004. From the time of the group's foundation, its members were subjected to repeated death threats. Williamson became the public face of the group, appearing on radio talk shows and television shows such as Perspective and Nationwide in which he argued against homophobia and called for greater government investment to tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Unlike most other LGBT rights activists in Jamaica, Williamson did not seek to protect himself by using a pseudonym, disguising his voice, or hiding his appearance. Facing hostility and threats of violence, Williamson left Jamaica and moved to Canada and then England, before returning to the island in 2002. There, he moved into an apartment in his Haughton Street compound and decided to take a renewed role within Jamaica's LGBT rights movement. He lived in one room of his apartment block and rented out a number of others.|$|E
