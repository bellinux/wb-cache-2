5|$|At around 17:00 a large {{formation}} of enemies {{showed up on}} radar headed towards TG38.3. As before, {{a great deal of}} these were shot down by combat air patrol. The surviving enemy planes flew down to the water level to evade further radar detection. These planestorpedo bombers and fighterssuccessfully ambushed the formation <b>just</b> <b>minutes</b> later. Evasive maneuvers, squall weather, and poor fighter cover {{on the part of the}} Japanese helped TG38.3 escape without suffering any significant damage.|$|E
5|$|At {{least four}} of the gunmen were {{soldiers}} from the UDR, the locally recruited infantry regiment of the British Army in Northern Ireland. Martin Dillon suggested in The Dirty War, that at least five serving UDR soldiers were present at the checkpoint.

5|$|Australia {{travelled}} to Bramall Lane {{under the}} captaincy of Miller. Captain Hassett and his deputy Morris were rested {{and stayed in}} London with the team manager. After the first day's play, he organised a party for that lasted until the next afternoon—the rest day. He woke up with a hangover the next day <b>just</b> <b>minutes</b> {{before the start of}} play. Improvising, Miller arrived at the ground in a hearse.

5|$|Bacteriophages are {{a common}} and diverse group of viruses and are the most {{abundant}} form of biological entity in aquatic environments– there are up to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than there are bacteria, reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per millilitre of seawater. These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell. Within {{a short amount of}} time, in some cases <b>just</b> <b>minutes,</b> bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane, and, {{in the case of the}} T4 phage, in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released.|$|E
5|$|By 7 March, the Seabees had the Momote {{airfield}} ready. Artillery spotting aircraft began {{operating from}} the strip on 6 March and a B-25 made {{an emergency landing}} the next day.

Convinced {{he was in}} a better position to capture the crossing over the River Risle there, he ordered the Netherlands Infantry Brigade to move and join the 5th Parachute Brigade in taking the town. On 26August the men of the parachute brigade, some mounted on the Cromwell tanks of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, raced towards the bridge from the east while the Dutch headed there from the west. The Dutch brigade arrived first, <b>just</b> <b>minutes</b> after the Germans destroyed the bridge, slightly ahead of the 7th Parachute Battalion. The Dutch brigade moved to secure the heights overlooking the river, while the 5th Parachute Brigade occupied the town.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February, {{thousands}} of Bahrainis participated in 55 marches in 25 locations throughout Bahrain. Protests were peaceful and protesters demanded deep reforms. The earliest demonstration started at 5:30a.m. in Nuwaidrat, the last <b>just</b> <b>minutes</b> before midnight {{in the vicinity}} of Salmaniya hospital heading to the Pearl Roundabout. The largest was in Sitra island. Security forces responded to protests by firing tear gas, rubber bullets, stun grenades and birdshot. More than 30 protesters were injured and one was killed by birdshot. The Bahraini Ministry of Interior said a number of security forces were injured after groups of protesters attacked them.|$|E
5|$|While at the hotel, Hendrix {{made several}} {{telephone}} calls. Dannemann said he phoned his lawyer Henry Steingarten, {{asking him to}} find a way out of his contract with his manager Mike Jeffery, and producer Eddie Kramer, for whom Hendrix left a voice message. Mitch Mitchell said that he called Hendrix at the Cumberland on September 17, after having been asked to do so by tour manager Gerry Stickells, who had spoken to Hendrix <b>just</b> <b>minutes</b> earlier. Mitchell said that during the phone conversation Hendrix agreed to join him around midnight at the Speakeasy Club for a previously arranged jam session, which included Sly Stone.|$|E

5|$|On Sunday 30 September, {{the body}} of prostitute Elizabeth Stride was {{discovered}} at about 1am in Dutfield's Yard, inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street (since renamed Henriques Street), Whitechapel. She was lying {{in a pool of}} blood with her throat cut from left to right. She had been killed <b>just</b> <b>minutes</b> before, and her body was otherwise unmutilated. It is possible that the murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard, perhaps Louis Diemschutz, who discovered the body. However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride's murder was unconnected to the others on the basis that the body was unmutilated, that it was the only murder to occur south of Whitechapel Road, and that the blade used might have been shorter and of a different design. Most experts, however, consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride's murder with at least two of the earlier ones, as well as that of Catherine Eddowes on the same night.|$|E
5|$|The game restarted, {{but many}} Bayern players were {{overwhelmed}} with despair, virtually unable {{to continue and}} needed the assistance of referee Pierluigi Collina to drag themselves off the ground. They were stunned to have lost a game they had thought won <b>just</b> <b>minutes</b> before (several celebratory flares had already been ignited by the Munich fans moments before United equalised, and Bayern Munich ribbons had already been secured to the trophy itself {{in preparation for the}} presentation ceremony). United held onto their lead to record their second European Cup title. Samuel Kuffour broke down in tears after the game, beating the floor in despair, and even the giant Carsten Jancker had collapsed in anguish. Matthäus had captained Bayern in the 1987 European Cup Final and lost in similar circumstances to two late Porto goals. He had been substituted with 10 minutes remaining, with victory seemingly assured, and the European Cup was the only major trophy he had failed to win during his career.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his lack}} of game time in the {{campaign}} before, Sparagna admitted during the off-season that he was considering a short term move away from Marseille {{in order to continue}} his development. On 24 July 2016, Ligue 2 side Auxerre announced that they had completed the signing of Sparagna on a season-long loan from Marseille, with no option of purchase being included in the deal. He made his debut for the club in their opening Ligue 2 game on 30 July 2016, playing the full 90 minutes in a 0–0 draw with Red Star. On 19 August, Sparagna was sent off in the 92nd minute of a 1–0 loss to Clermont for committing a second bookable offense. It {{was the first time in}} his career that he had been dismissed at senior club level. The Ligue 2 disciplinary committee later handed Sparagna a three-match ban for his indiscretions, included in which was a one-match suspended sentence. On 21 October, having set up Gaëtan Courtet for Auxerre's equalizer <b>just</b> <b>minutes</b> before, Sparagna netted the first own goal of his career in the 83rd minute of the match to hand Strasbourg a 2–1 win. He made 33 appearances across all competitions as Auxerre ended the Ligue 2 campaign in 17th position, one place above the relegation play-offs, before returning to Marseille at the end of the season.|$|E
