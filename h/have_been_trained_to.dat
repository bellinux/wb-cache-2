5|$|Bears {{in captivity}} have for centuries {{been used for}} entertainment. They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> dance, and were kept for baiting in Europe {{at least since the}} 16th century. There were five bear-baiting gardens in Southwark, London at that time; archaeological remains of three of these have survived. Across Europe, nomadic Romani bear {{handlers}} called Ursari lived by busking with their bears from the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|California {{sea lions}} {{are used in}} {{military}} applications by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. In the Persian Gulf, the animals <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> swim behind divers approaching a U.S. naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver's leg. Navy officials say that the sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that such operations put the animals in danger. The Navy insists that the sea lions are removed once their mission is complete.|$|E

The first swans were trained {{by one of the}} daughters of Bishop Hervey in the 1870s. Two swans which were given to the bishop by Queen Elizabeth II in 2006, are still able to ring for lunch fed to them by the caretakers who live in the gatehouse.|$|E

5|$|Unanticipated deaths among recent condor populations {{occurred}} due {{to contact}} with golden eagles, lead poisoning, {{and other factors}} such as power line collisions. Since 1994, captive-bred California condors <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> avoid power lines and people. Since the implementation of this aversion conditioning program, the number of condor deaths due to power lines has greatly decreased. Lead poisoning due to fragmented lead bullets in large game waste is a particularly big problem for condors due to their extremely strong digestive juices; lead waste is not {{as much of a}} problem for other avian scavengers such as the turkey vulture and common raven. This problem has been addressed in California by the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, a bill that went into effect July 1, 2008 that requires that hunters use non-lead bullets when hunting in the condor's range. Blood lead levels in golden eagles as well as turkey vultures has declined with the implementation of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, demonstrating that the legislation has helped reduce other species' lead exposures aside from the California condor. There is no comparable anti-lead-bullet legislation in the other states in which the condor currently resides.|$|E

500|$|To explain each form, Russell {{provides}} illustrations. The {{power of}} mere force {{is like the}} tying of a rope around a pig's belly and lifting {{it up to a}} ship while ignoring its cries. The power of inducements is likened to two things: either conditioning, as exemplified by circus animals which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> perform this-or-that trick for an audience, or group acquiescence, as when the leader among sheep is dragged along by chains to get the rest of the flock to follow. Finally, the power of propaganda is akin to the use of carrot and stick to influence the behaviour of a donkey, {{in the sense that the}} donkey is being persuaded that making certain actions (following the carrot, avoiding the stick) would be more or less to their benefit. (Russell 1938:24) ...|$|E
500|$|The horses {{who have}} served as Thunder <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> remain calm in {{situations}} that would normally cause a horse to respond with a fight-or-flight response, such as the flashing explosions of a pyrotechnic display, or items suddenly landing on the field including skydivers with parachutes and various objects thrown by spectators, or loud music and the sounds associated {{with tens of thousands}} of cheering fans at Mile High. Ann Judge has explained that because so many unexpected things can happen, it is important that the people working with him remain calm; it is trust in his rider and handlers, not just desensitization, that helps the horse remain steady: [...] "You want them to look to you for the appropriate response and for confidence and faith so that the flight response doesn’t get initiated." [...] She describes the process by saying, [...] "if something is fearful to him, as long as he looks to me, and I tell him he’s OK, he’s OK." [...] The only frightening stimuli that was an ongoing problem for both Thunder Sr. and Thunder II was when the crowd would perform the wave; Thunder Sr. would stand still, but tremble. Thunder II would become tense, requiring ground handlers and his rider to help steady him. Thunder III is the first of the mascots to tolerate wearing earplugs, which help protect his hearing from loud noises during games.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1624 English Village {{section of}} the museum, first-person interpreters <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> speak, act, and dress {{appropriately}} for the period, whereas third-person (or modern) interpreters <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> answer inquiries that guests may have which those in character are unable to answer while in their respective roles. [...] At Plimoth Plantation, they are called historical interpreters, and they interact with their [...] "strange visitors" [...] (i.e., the modern general public) in the first person, answering questions, discussing their lives and viewpoints, and participating in tasks such as cooking, planting, blacksmithing, and animal husbandry. The 1624 English Village loosely follows a time line, chronologically representing the calendar year 1624 from late March through November (the months when the museum is open), depicting day-to-day life and seasonal activities, as well as featuring some key historical events, such as funerals and special celebrations.|$|E
2500|$|Knowing-how, on {{the other}} hand, {{is the way we}} deal with things normally.

2500|$|Communication {{is carried}} out with clicks, creaks, and buzzes at a {{dominant}} frequency of about 60kilohertz, which {{is thought to be}} used for echolocation. Bony fish and fish eggs, cephalopods, and crustaceans are taken as food. Observations of captive animals indicate food may be taken into the mouth by suction. Irrawaddy dolphins are capable of squirting streams of water that can reach up to 1.5 m; this distinct behavior has been known for herding fish into general area for hunting. They do this sometimes while spyhopping and during feeding, apparently to expel water ingested during fish capture or possibly to herd fish.
