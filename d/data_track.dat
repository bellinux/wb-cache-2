Owned and operated by Manchester Airports Group, the airport handles 800,000 passengers annually and supports around 900 full-time equivalent jobs which contribute more than £24million to the local economy. Between 2007 and 2010 the airport underwent a £45million upgrade which included {{the construction of a new}} departure terminal. Other major employers in Christchurch include: BAE Systems, Bournemouth Aviation Services Company (BASCO), Beagle Aerospace, Bournemouth International Airport Ltd, Channel Express, College of Air Traffic Control, <b>Data</b> <b>Track</b> Process Instruments, European Aviation, FR Aviation, Honeywell, Reid Steel, Revvo Castor Company, Sainsbury's, Siemens VAI and SELEX Communications.|$|E

5000|$|Mixed mode CDs are implicitly {{described}} in the original CD-ROM standard (the Yellow Book, later standardized as ISO/IEC 10149 and ECMA-130), which allows a CD-ROM to contain only <b>data</b> <b>tracks,</b> or <b>data</b> <b>tracks</b> and audio tracks. The CD-ROM standard, however, does not mention the term [...] "mixed mode", nor does it describe any particular order of <b>data</b> and audio <b>tracks</b> on the disc. Since the original CD-ROM standard did not support multiple sessions, mixed mode CDs are created using only one session.|$|R
2500|$|A blank CD-R is not [...] "empty"; the pregroove has a wobble (the ATIP), {{which helps}} the writing laser {{to stay on}} track and to write the data to the disc at a {{constant}} rate. Maintaining a constant rate is essential to ensure proper size and spacing of the pits and lands burned into the dye layer. As well as providing timing information, the ATIP (absolute time in pregroove) is also a <b>data</b> <b>track</b> containing information about the CD-R manufacturer, the dye used and media information (disc length and so on). The pregroove is not destroyed when the data are written to the CD-R, a point which some copy protection schemes use to distinguish copies from an original CD.|$|E

Similar content was included and expanded upon on the Shoe Box E.P.; however, the format of the enhanced CD used in the creation of that CD renders the <b>data</b> <b>track</b> inaccessible on modern operating systems.|$|E

40|$|The data {{management}} problem comprises data processing and <b>data</b> <b>tracking.</b> <b>Data</b> processing {{is the creation}} of new data based on existing <b>data</b> sources. <b>Data</b> <b>tracking</b> consists of storing metadata descriptions of available data. This paper addresses the {{data management}} problem by casting it as an AI planning problem. Actions are data-processing commands, plans are dataflow programs and goals are metadata descriptions of desired data products. Data manipulation is simply plan generation and execution, and a key component of <b>data</b> <b>tracking</b> is inferring the effects of an observed plan. We introduce a new action language for data management domains, called ADILM. We discuss the connection between data processing and information integration and show how a language for the latter must be modified to support the former. The paper also discusses information gathering within a data-processing framework, and show how ADILM metadata expressions are a generalization of Local Completeness...|$|R

50|$|A mixed mode CD is a Compact Disc which {{contains}} both data and audio in one session. Typically the first track is a <b>data</b> <b>track</b> {{while the rest}} are audio tracks. The most common use for mixed mode CDs is to add CD-quality audio to video games on a CD.|$|E
