40|$|The {{recent and}} the {{proposed}} entry of new airlines both in the ‘no-frills’ and in the “full service” categories has completely changed the aviation scenario in India. Obviously this explosive increase in capacity will {{have a profound effect}} on the economy of the airlines both in the short term as well as in the long term. A growth of over 25 % per annum in passenger traffic may not be sustainable for long; thus galloping increase in capacity may result in mergers and strategic alliances of airlines on one side and closing down of some of the airlines on the other side. A point to be noted is that most of the new entrants also operate in the major trunk routes and serve the metros and the major cities. What appears to have not been tapped is the equally large potential in the regional and short haul sectors, which serve major, and small city pairs and also act as feeders to the major hubs. Realizing the importance of this, the government in its new civil aviation policy has given thrust to regional/ short-haul air travel. In this paper, an attempt is made to review the hierarchy of airline networks in India with respect to trunk, major and feeder routes. The air passenger traffic carried in each sector in terms of revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) is compared with upper class rail traffic. The present status of feeder airline services in India is outlined. It is pertinent to study the passenger traffic demand in these feeder routes as compared to upper class rail traffic as some percentage of upper class rail passengers are willing to shift to air travel due to marginal difference between airfare and upper class rail fare. The future RPKs are forecasted based on the actual RPKs (1999 - 2004 data) and the estimated RPKs (1999 - 2008) of earlier market survey. A suitable aircraft size for airline operations in these feeder routes is arrived at based on existing air traffic data by a simple method. A macroscopic measure is used to determine the aircraft demand by assuming average block speed and utilization for each aircraft type. A sensitivity analysis was carried out for various levels of traffic growth keeping in view the sharp increase of air travel in recent years and further growth in air traffic fuelled by <b>feeder</b> <b>sector</b> as the hinterland opens up industry, services and tourism. The approach followed in this report will help for assessing alternative fleet scenarios and possibly reflects a quick method of estimation of passenger traffic, aircraft and fleet size for serving feeder air network in India...|$|E
50|$|Oslo Air Traffic Control Center or Oslo ATCC (Oslo Kontrollsentral) is {{responsible}} for the controlled airspace above Eastern Norway. The area control center is located at Røyken, between Oslo and Drammen. The Control Center is owned and operated by the state enterprise Avinor. Avinor's board had originally decided to close Oslo ATCC in 2008, transferring its responsibilities to Stavanger ATCC and a planned new terminal control center at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. However, new management has postponed the actual closing, and redefined Oslo ATCC as an approach control with surrounding <b>feeder</b> <b>sectors.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{effectively}} {{model and}} efficiently {{solve the problem}} of balancing and minimizing the traffic complexities of an airspace of adjacent sectors. The traffic complexity of a sector is here defined in terms of the numbers of flights within it, near its border, and on non-level segments within it. The allowed forms of complexity resolution are the changing of the take-off times of not yet airborne flights, the changing of the remaining approach times into the chosen airspace of already airborne flights by slowing down and speeding up within the two layers of <b>feeder</b> <b>sectors</b> around that airspace, as well as the changing of the levels of passage over way-points in that airspace. Experiments with actual European flight profiles obtained from the Central Flow Management Unit (CFMU) show that these forms of complexity resolution can lead to significant complexity reductions and rebalancing...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{airspace}} configuration concept {{strives to}} remove today’s rigid structure of navigation aids, airways, pre-defined sectors of airspace, and special-use airspace to provide traffic managers with more flexibility to reconfigure airspace to address convective weather and meet fluctuations in user demand. The impact of increasing levels of {{air traffic management}} automation on controller workload and airspace capacity is analyzed. The automation levels represent a current operations baseline; seamless, integrated datalink operations; and automated airspace operations in which separation, merging and spacing guidance is provided for 33, 000 ft and above without human controller involvement. Denver Center traffic and airspace for a good weather day are modeled to predict the effect of increased controller productivity on airspace configuration strategies. Results indicate that integrated datalink operations enable {{the high and low}} altitude <b>feeder</b> <b>sectors</b> for Denver arrivals to be combined into a single sector for the selected traffic demand, facilitating more uninterrupted descents than possible under current operations. Furthermore, results indicate automated airspace operations enable a single en route sector team to manage airspace below 33, 000 ft that is a combination of 5 of today’s sectors. I...|$|R
50|$|While {{this change}} would have ostensibly {{decreased}} the stakes of the Thanaweya Amma test, {{it should be}} noted that Sadat’s education policies also encouraged the growth of private, fee-based education; these policies continued through the Mubarak era, especially in the late 1980s under Education Minister Fathi Sorour. As a result, those with means migrated to a parallel private school system which became the <b>feeder</b> for private <b>sector</b> labor, while success in public school and on the Thanaweya Amma remained the incredibly important for the social mobility of those from lower classes.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{economic}} recession and its adverse impact on air travel, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) continues to forecast {{an increase in}} air traffic demand that may see traffic double or triple by the year 2025. Increases in air traffic will burden the air traffic management system, {{and higher levels of}} safety and efficiency will be required. The air traffic controllers primary task is to ensure separation between aircraft in their airspace and keep the skies safe. As air traffic is forecasted to increase in volume and complexity [1], there is an increased likelihood of conflicts between aircraft, which adds risk and inefficiency to air traffic management and increases controller workload. To attenuate these factors, recent ATM research has shown that air and ground-based automation tools could reduce controller workload, especially if the automation is focused on conflict detection and resolution. Conflict Alert is a short time horizon conflict detection tool deployed in the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), which has limited utility due to the high number of false alerts generated and its use of dead reckoning to predict loss of separation between aircraft. Terminal Tactical Separation Assurance Flight Environment (T-TSAFE) is a short time horizon conflict detection tool that uses both flight intent and dead reckoning to detect conflicts. Results of a fast time simulation experiment indicated that TTSAFE provided a more effective alert lead-time and generated less false alerts than Conflict Alert [2]. TSAFE was previously tested in a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) simulation study that focused on the en route phase of flight [3]. The current study tested the T-TSAFE tool in an HITL simulation study, focusing on the terminal environment with current day operations. The study identified procedures, roles, responsibilities, information requirements and usability, with the help of TRACON controllers who participated in the experiment. Metrics such as lead alert time, alert response time, workload, situation awareness and other measures were statistically analyzed. These metrics were examined from an overall perspective and comparisons between conditions (altitude resolutions via keyboard entry vs. ADS-B entry) and controller positions (two final approach <b>sectors</b> and two <b>feeder</b> <b>sectors)</b> were also examined. Results of these analyses and controller feedback provided evidence of T-TSAFE s potential promise as a useful air traffic controller tool. Heuristic analysis also provided information on ways in which the T-TSAFE tool can be improved. Details of analyses results will be presented in the full paper...|$|R

Primarily a cow-calf state with a substantial backgrounding sector, Kentucky is a large supplier of feeder cattle to the cattle finishing sector. Price relationships within the market for Kentucky feeder cattle were examined using historical price data from Kentucky livestock auction markets. This research revealed many interesting price relationships that Kentucky producers may use in order to increase the profitability of the cow-calf and/or backgrounding operations. A segment of this research includes a Grazing Management Decision Tool which was constructed to enable producers to evaluate the potential profitability of various grazing scenarios using current market forecasts...|$|R

This work {{presents}} a multi-agent system for automatic restoration of power distribution networks. The proposed system {{consists of three}} types of agents: device agent, feeder agent and substation agent. Device agents are associated with system equipment and are responsible for information acquisition of the network; the feeder agents are responsible to manage the feeders; and the substations agents are accountable of manage the network supply capability. The behaviors and interactions of the system agents during the restoration process, aiming to restore the <b>feeder</b> <b>sectors</b> affected by but not in fault, are presented. Eight case studies are presented, which test different possible situations {{likely to be found}} in the distribution systems, such as restoration by uncoordinated protection, partial recovery of the system because of operating system restrictions and recomposition for faults in the transformer substation. To validate the test cases a simulator was developed, which allows the simulation of faults in different locations of the power system under study. Through the simulator, where there are the single line diagram of the system with the state of the equipment and the tool to capture message in JADE, is possible to simulate different scenarios and observe the interaction of agents in search of system restoration. The proposed system is able to locate and isolate the fault, and restore suitably the system, considering operating limits and uncoordinated system protection...|$|R
40|$|Air {{transportation}} is attractive because of time saving {{and its role}} has been increasingly becoming necessitated by deregulation, privatisation and globalisation. It is common in short haul routes that the ratio of airtime to total journey time to accomplish the travel is very small and adverse to have attraction. The access and egress to and from airport facilities is extremely important. The need to improve connectivity in terms of capacity and rapidity to existing and new airports with alternative urban transport technologies like Metro Rail, Light Rail, and Monorail has been emphasised in this paper considering {{the rapid expansion of}} civil aviation, starting of operations by new airlines in India and air travel is becoming a need as against luxury in the past. The sharp increase in air travel in India {{over the last two years}} indicates that the future growth in air traffic will be fuelled by <b>feeder</b> air <b>sector,</b> as the hinterland opens up industry, service and tourism. To derive fully the advantages of short haul air transportation, the integration of transport systems with necessary logistics feeding each transport modes is necessary to perform a seamless journey. This paper aims at addressing these issues also and generates an argument for the need of planning urban transport technologies in a complimentary role for the growth of short haul air routes in India. It is very important to consider at the conceptual stage, the integration of urban transport/traffic management schemes. Such established schemes will make short haul air trips in India seamless and attractive which in turn will help for further growth of civil aviation, thereby enabling India's economic development. Further, issues such as perspectives in city planning and traffic management systems, maintenance-repair-overhaul services of air fleet, Air traffic management infrastructure and human resource development, which also play a catalytic role and prudent to the success of short haul air transport are highlighted in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{over the}} total costs {{assessed}} to the beef industry from {{the implementation of}} mandatory country-of-origin labeling (COOL) regulations warranted {{an investigation into the}} estimation and distribution of marketing and marginal costs of production for retail chain stores and distributors, meat packers and processors, cattle feedlots, cattle backgrounding yards and cow-calf producers. Furthermore, it is thought the implementation of COOL will impose severe market and social welfare effects on the participants in the beef industry. This research focused on two main objectives. The first objective is to provide a full beef industry cost assessment for implementing COOL regulations based on the preliminary guidelines for COOL as published by the United States Department of Agriculture in the proposed rule in October of 2003. Financial and production data was collected and used from U. S. retail chain stores and distributors, meat packers and processors, cattle feedlots, and cattle backgrounding yards and stockers. The second objective was to use the weighted average cost estimates calculated from the data to determine the magnitude of increases in the demand for retail beef, wholesale beef, fed cattle, and feeder cattle needed to negate the increase in costs of implementing mandatory COOL regulations. An equilibrium displacement model was used to demonstrate the supply and demand functions and relationships for retail beef, wholesale beef, fed cattle, and feeder cattle. Estimated elasticities for retail beef, wholesale beef, fed cattle and feeder cattle were used to calculate the relative changes in price and quantity in response to the COOL-induced supply and demand shifts. The quantity intercepts from the estimation of the linear parameters can be used to calculate the increases in consumer demand needed to negate the increases in costs estimated from the survey results for the retail, wholesale, fed cattle, and <b>feeder</b> cattle <b>sectors</b> of the beef industry. A significant cost burden to the beef industry was shown by the weighted average estimates calculated from the research. Retail chain stores and distributors, meat packers and processors, cattle feedlots and cattle stockers are expected to see an increase in marketing and marginal costs of production as a result of implementing COOL...|$|R
