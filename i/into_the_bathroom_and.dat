Clark Bent uses his X-ray vision to peer <b>into</b> <b>the</b> women's <b>bathroom,</b> <b>and</b> Captain Marbles has {{abandoned}} good deeds for the pursuit of money. The conflict between the two characters also parodies the National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications trial.|$|R

At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> sat there by myself. There weren't any people around then and I was just really alone in that stall. I just sat there and thought of anything that was happening during that time. The tears just came."

Although she does not remember the face of her attacker, Emad finds the culprit left his car keys, which he matches to a pick-up parked outside. The attacker also left behind a mobile phone and money which Rana purchased groceries with, thinking Emad had left it for her. Emad increasingly blames Babak for hiding the truth about the former tenant, at one point calling his character Charley a degenerate {{in the midst of a}} performance, although this is not in Miller's script.|$|R
2500|$|The {{problem of}} a weak case against Ethel Rosenberg was solved just 10 days {{before the start of}} the trial when David and Ruth Greenglass were reinterviewed. They were persuaded to change their {{original}} stories. David had said that he'd passed the atomic data he'd collected to Julius on a New York street corner. Now he stated that he'd given this information to Julius in the living room of the Rosenberg's New York apartment and that Ethel, at Julius's request, had taken his notes and [...] "typed them up." [...] In her re-interview Ruth expanded on her husband's version: [...] "Julius then took the info <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> read it and when he came out he called Ethel and told her she had to type this info immediately... Ethel then sat down at the typewriter which she placed on a bridge table in the living room and proceeded to type the info which David had given to Julius." [...] As a result of this new testimony, all charges against Ruth were dropped.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, the girl's siblings heard her scream, [...] "No, don't!" [...] Later, Fred returned downstairs. The girl was found by her siblings writhing in pain, sobbing that her father had raped and sodomised her, at one stage partially strangling her. When Rose returned home, the girl confided in her mother that she had been raped by Fred, although Rose simply replied, [...] "Oh well. You were asking for it." [...] Over the following weeks, the girl was raped on three further occasions, with Rose personally witnessing one of these rapes before following her distressed and bleeding daughter <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> asking the child, [...] "Well, what did you expect?" [...] Fred also filmed one of these rapes. Several weeks later, the girl garnered the courage to confide in a close friend what her father had done; this friend would divulge what had happened to her own mother on 4 August. In response, the friend's mother anonymously informed the police.|$|E
2500|$|June Juanico [...] "recalls a {{time when}} she stood up to Elvis in front of his band of hangers-on, who even then were {{beginning}} to accompany him everywhere. He grabbed her arm, took her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> declared: 'Look, you are so right, I am really sorry.' He kept her there for five minutes, then swaggered out, his image intact." [...] Julie Parrish, Presley's co-star in Paradise Hawaiian Style, relates, [...] "One time on set I had a real pain in my side – a side-effect, I think – and Elvis scooped me up, carried me into his trailer and shut the door. Outside the crew was waiting and wondering, but Elvis was oblivious to the innuendo. He placed his hand over my side and tried to do some healing on me." [...] Playboy star and actress June Wilkinson remembered that she [...] "met Elvis on the set of King Creole. He invited me to dinner at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. ... Then Elvis gave me a tour of his suite, sat me on the bed in his bedroom and sang to me for two hours. That was it. The next day ... we had dinner again. He was very sweet, and he was friendly. He had more than sex on his mind. He got me to the airport on time, and our paths never crossed again." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a New York City park, hippies have {{gathered}} with guitars to sing protest songs. Fritz {{and his buddies}} show up {{in an attempt to}} meet girls. When a trio of attractive females walk by, Fritz and his friends exhaust themselves trying to get their attention, but find that the girls are more interested in the crow standing a few feet away. The girls attempt to flirt with the crow, making unintentionally condescending remarks about blacks, while Fritz looks on in annoyance. Suddenly, the crow rebukes the girls with a snide remark, indicates that he is gay and walks away. Fritz invites the girls to [...] "seek the truth", bringing them up to his friend's apartment, where a wild party is taking place. Since the other rooms are crowded, Fritz drags the girls <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> the four of them have group sex in the bathtub. Meanwhile, the police (portrayed as pigs) arrive to raid the party. As the two officers walk up the stairs, one of the party-goers finds Fritz and the girls in the bath tub. Several others jump in, pushing Fritz to the side where he takes solace in marijuana. The two officers break into the apartment, but find that it is empty because everyone has moved into the bathroom. Fritz takes refuge in the toilet when one of the pigs enters the bathroom and begins to beat up the partygoers. As the pig becomes exhausted, a very stoned Fritz jumps out, grabs the pig's gun, and shoots the toilet, causing the water main to break and flooding everybody out of the apartment. The pigs chase Fritz down the street into a synagogue. Fritz manages to escape when the congregation gets up to celebrate the United States' decision to send more weapons into Israel.|$|E
2500|$|The Normal Heart is a play set between 1981 and 1984. It {{addresses}} a writer named Ned Weeks as he nurses his lover, who is dying of an unnamed disease. His doctors are puzzled and frustrated by having no resources to research it. Meanwhile, the unnamed organization Weeks {{is involved in}} is angered by the bad publicity Weeks' activism is generating, and eventually throws him out. Kramer later explained, [...] "I tried to make Ned Weeks as obnoxious as I could... I was trying, somehow and again, to atone for my own behavior." [...] The experience was overwhelmingly emotional for Kramer, as at one time during rehearsals he watched actor Brad Davis hold his dying lover played by D.W. Moffett on stage; Kramer went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> sobbed, only moments later to find Davis holding him. The play is considered a literary landmark. It contended with the AIDS crisis when few would speak of the disease afflicting gay men, including gays themselves; it remains the longest-running play ever staged at the Public Theater, running for a year starting in 1985. It has been produced over 600 times in the U.S., Europe (where it was televised in Poland), Israel, and South Africa. Actors following Davis who portrayed Kramer's alter ego Ned Weeks included Joel Grey, Richard Dreyfuss (in Los Angeles), Martin Sheen (at the Royal Court in London), Tom Hulce and then John Shea in the West End, Raul Esparza in a highly acclaimed 2004 revival at the Public Theater, and most recently Joe Mantello on Broadway at the Golden Theater. Upon seeing the production of The Normal Heart, Naomi Wolf commented, [...] "No one else on the left at that time... ever used the moral framework that is {{so much a part}} of Kramer's voice, and that the right has coopted so skillfully. [...] Conscience, responsibility, calling; truth and lies, clarity of purpose or abandonment of one's moral calling; loyalty and betrayal..." ...|$|E
