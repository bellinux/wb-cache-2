5|$|Among all predators, ants are the {{greatest}} enemy to termites. Some ant genera are specialist predators of termites. For example, Megaponera is a strictly termite-eating (termitophagous) genus that perform raiding activities, some lasting several hours. Paltothyreus tarsatus is another termite-raiding species, with each individual stacking as many termites as possible in its mandibles before returning home, all the while recruiting additional nestmates to the raiding site through chemical trails. The Malaysian basicerotine ants Eurhopalothrix heliscata uses a different strategy of termite hunting by pressing themselves into tight spaces, as they hunt through rotting wood housing termite colonies. Once inside, the ants seize their prey by using their short but sharp mandibles. Tetramorium uelense is a specialised predator species that feeds on small termites. A scout recruits 10–30 workers to an area where termites are present, killing them by immobilising them with their stinger. Centromyrmex and Iridomyrmex colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are preyed on by these ants. No evidence for any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>relationship</b> (other than a predatory one) is known. Other ants, including Acanthostichus, Camponotus, Crematogaster, Cylindromyrmex, Leptogenys, Odontomachus, Ophthalmopone, Pachycondyla, Rhytidoponera, Solenopsis and Wasmannia, also prey on termites. In contrast to all these ant species, and despite their enormous diversity of prey, Dorylus ants rarely consume termites.|$|E
5|$|Iridomyrmex {{primarily}} {{feeds on}} sweet {{foods such as}} nectar and honeydew. They hunt for insects and other ants to feed to their young, and workers are particularly attracted to seeds with elaiosomes. They collect these seeds, remove the elaiosomes, and then discard the seeds. The seedlings that sprout from these seeds benefit from proximity to the aggressive Iridomyrmex ants, giving them {{a better chance of}} survival. Colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are regularly preyed on by Iridomyrmex; no evidence for any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>relationship</b> (other than a predatory one) is known. Juvenile cane toads are often preyed on, as certain Iridomyrmex species such as I. purpureus and I. ruburrus are immune to the toxins released by the cane toads. As a result, placing Iridomyrmex nests in habitats which house cane toads have been suggested as a method of controlling the cane toad population. The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that feeds on guano.|$|E

25|$|A common {{aspect of}} {{recovery}} {{is said to}} be the presence of others who believe in the person's potential to recover, and who stand by them. While mental health professionals can offer a particular limited <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>relationship</b> and help foster hope, relationships with friends, family and the community are said to often be of wider and longer-term importance. Others who have experienced similar difficulties, who may be on a journey of recovery, can be of particular importance. Those who share the same values and outlooks more generally (not just in the area of mental health) may also be particularly important. It is said that one-way relationships based on being helped can actually be devaluing, and that reciprocal relationships and mutual support networks can be of more value to self-esteem and recovery.|$|E

500|$|We had a {{marvelous}} antagonist, so omnipotent {{that for us}} to defeat it or even communicate with it, or have any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>relationship</b> with it, made the initial concept of the story false.

Actor Josh Holloway was told that an emotional undercurrent of the episode concerned his failed relationship with Kate.

500|$|... 54 {{species of}} ants {{are known to}} inhabit Nasutitermes mounds, both {{occupied}} and abandoned ones. One reason many ants live in Nasutitermes mounds {{is due to the}} termites' frequent occurrence in their geographical range; another is to protect themselves from floods. Iridomyrmex also inhabits termite mounds although no evidence for any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>relationship</b> (other than a predatory one) is known. In rare cases, certain species of termites live inside active ant colonies. Some invertebrate organisms such as beetles, caterpillars, flies and millipedes are termitophiles and dwell inside termite colonies (they are unable to survive independently). As a result, certain beetles and flies have evolved with their hosts. They have developed a gland that secrete a substance that attracts the workers by licking them. Mounds may also provide shelter and warmth to birds, lizards, snakes and scorpions.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the episode, the Doctor behaves erratically, as he {{gradually}} gets used to his {{new body}} and tastes while developing a new personality. Willis stated that he [...] "finally clicks into place" [...] after picking out his new outfit." [...] The rooftop scene {{was not in the}} original script; the Doctor simply ran away from the ward and returned to the TARDIS. Moffat felt that he did not really have a formal introduction, and that more could be made of the costume, as many previous Doctors had picked theirs out quietly. The main story arc is the Doctor meeting the grown-up Amy. Moffat felt that over time the relationships between the Doctor and his companions had become too adult. He wanted to create a childlike relationship like that between Peter Pan and Wendy, rather than boyfriend and girlfriend. He believed this was the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>relationship</b> viewers had with the Doctor, regardless of their age. When the Doctor returns for Amy, she is a very different person from the seven-year-old he had met before. Moffat explains that she developed a tough element and had become distrustful and cynical due to him not returning as promised, forcing her to accept that he was an imaginary friend. Rory was completely in love with Amy, but Amy wanted adventures before admitting she loved him, too. Moffat described Rory as someone who had grown up in the shadow of Amy's imaginary Doctor.|$|E

We examine different types <b>of</b> <b>relationships</b> by length, type, breadth and depth. We find prior relationships, characterized {{in a number of}} different ways – whether pure savings, transactions, credit related, or multi-prong, significantly reduce borrower default probability. To understand why relationship loans default less we examine loan applications and the bank decision acceptance decision. Using selection models we find that the lower default rate is explained by better screening by banks of loans with prior relationships, as well as enhanced monitoring. Our results provide evidence on the value <b>of</b> different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>of</b> retail customers with banks, and empirically document the sources of these benefits...|$|R
