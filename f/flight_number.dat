5|$|Malaysia Airlines retired the Flight 370 (MH370) <b>flight</b> <b>number</b> and {{replaced}} it with Flight 318 (MH318) beginning 14 March. This follows a common practice among airlines to rename flights following notorious accidents. The flight—Malaysia Airline's second daily flight to Beijing—was later suspended beginning 2 May; according to insiders, this was due to lack of demand.|$|E
5|$|The CSM {{for this}} <b>flight,</b> <b>number</b> 012 built by North American Aviation (NAA), was a Block I version {{designed}} before the lunar orbit rendezvous landing strategy was chosen; therefore it lacked capability of docking with the Lunar Module. This {{was incorporated into}} the Block II CSM design, along with lessons learned in Block I. Block II would be test-flown with the LM when the latter was ready, and would be used on the Moon landing flights.|$|E

5|$|Early {{estimates}} on {{rebuilding the}} damaged {{section of the}} Pentagon were {{that it would take}} three years to complete. However, the project moved forward at an accelerated pace and was completed by the one-year anniversary of the attack. The rebuilt section of the Pentagon includes a small indoor memorial and chapel at the point of impact. An outdoor memorial, commissioned by the Pentagon and designed by Julie Beckman and Keith Kaseman, was completed on schedule for its dedication on September 11, 2008.

50|$|Following STS-9, the <b>flight</b> <b>numbering</b> {{system for}} the Space Shuttle program was changed. Thus, the next flight, instead of being {{designated}} STS-11, became STS-41-B; the original successor to STS-9, STS-10, was cancelled due to payload delays. This was done due to fears that a <b>flight</b> <b>numbered</b> STS-13 could suffer a mishap as Apollo 13 did.|$|R

5000|$|AaE flight {{operations}} are somewhat complex and varied. [...] "Next Flight" [...] services use {{space on the}} next available scheduled Qantas passenger flights. Items carried for Overnight, 2 Day Economy and Off-Peak deliveries are flown on both Qantas and Australian airExpress aircraft operated by Express Freighters Australia, National Jet Systems subsidiary National Jet Express, and Pel-Air. The company does not service the Northern Territory 'overnight' from Sydney. Due to the three different service providers, AaE flights operate using different <b>flight</b> <b>numbers</b> and callsigns. The Express Freighters Australia Boeing 737s use Qantas <b>flight</b> <b>numbers</b> and callsigns as the ground handling is done by Qantas/Express Freighters, while National Jet Express uses the aircraft registration as their callsign and uses the IATA designator XM for its <b>flight</b> <b>numbers</b> (and uses the ICAO designator XME). Pel-Air flights also use XM <b>flight</b> <b>numbers</b> but have no specific callsigns. AaE also has an international Division called Australian airExpress International.|$|R
