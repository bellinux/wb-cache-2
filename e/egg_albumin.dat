5000|$|A {{classic example}} of {{denaturing}} in proteins comes from egg whites, which are typically largely <b>egg</b> <b>albumins</b> in water. Fresh from the eggs, egg whites are transparent and liquid. Cooking the thermally unstable whites turns them opaque, forming an interconnected solid mass. The same transformation can be effected with a denaturing chemical. Pouring egg whites into a beaker of acetone will also turn egg whites translucent and solid. The skin that forms on curdled milk is another common example of denatured protein.

A total of 120 Hisex Brown hens, 48 weeks of age, were used. The birds were allocated in a completely randomized design consisting of five treatments, six replicates and four animals per experimental unit. The experimental diets were formulated with corn and soybean meal and the treatments consisted of five levels of sodium (0. 12, 0. 17, 0. 22, 0. 27 and 0. 32 %) derived from common salt. The following parameters were evaluated: feed intake (g), egg production (%), egg weight (g), egg mass (g), feed conversion (kg) per kilogram of eggs and per dozen eggs, specific gravity (g/cm 3), shell thickness (mm), egg components including egg yolk (g and %), albumin (g and %) and shell (g and %), viability (%), and variation in body weight (g) of the birds. There was no effect (P> 0. 05) of sodium levels on egg yolk weight (g) or albumin percentage. A decreasing linear effect (P< 0. 01) was observed for feed intake, which decreased with increasing sodium level in the diet. A quadratic effect (P< 0. 05) was found for egg production, egg weight, feed conversion per kilogram of eggs and dozen <b>eggs,</b> <b>albumin</b> and shell weight, specific gravity, shell thickness, and percentage of shell and egg yolk. A sodium level higher than 0. 27 % negatively influenced egg components and zootechnical performance of the birds.

40|$|Egg, soy or whey protein co-exists with {{wheat gluten}} in {{different}} food products. Different protein types impact {{each other during}} heat treatment. A positive co-protein effect occurs when heat-induced polymerization of a mixture of proteins is more intense {{than that of the}} isolated proteins. The intrinsic protein characteristics of globular proteins which enhance polymerization in mixtures with gluten are unknown. Here, a model was developed to predict potential co-protein effects in mixtures of gluten and globular proteins during heating at 100 °C. A negative co-protein effect with addition of lysozyme, no co-protein effect with soy glycinin or egg yolk and positive co-protein effects with bovine serum <b>albumin,</b> (S-) ovalbumin, <b>egg</b> white, whole egg, defatted <b>egg</b> yolk, wheat <b>albumins</b> and wheat globulins were detected. The level of accessible free sulfhydryl groups and the surface hydrophobicity of unfolded globular proteins were the main characteristics determining co-protein effects in gluten mixtures. status: publishe...|$|R
