As of 2008 trade {{between the two nations}} accounted for US$ 1 billion. Ukraine is a notable exporter to Belgium of precious metals and minerals, oil products and chemicals whilst Belgium is a major supplier to Ukraine of machines, industrial and <b>electrotechnical</b> <b>equipment,</b> chemicals, rubber, and also certain metals. The nations are also connected in the beer industry, with the Belgian brewing company Interbrew having a share of 34.3% in the Ukrainian beer market, thanks to its cooperation with the Ukrainian brewers of Chernigiv, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. General Belgian investments in the economy of Ukraine had grown rapidly and as of July 2008, some US$ 44 million was put in the Ukrainian economy by Belgian investors, with 31.5% into wholesale trade, 16% into transport and communications, 15% into the food-processing industry (15%) and 13% into mechanical engineering respectively.

40|$|Electricity and {{electrotechnical}} industry {{have taken a}} central position in Swedish industrial development ever since the breakthrough of the high-voltage technique in the 1890 s. Some reasons {{for the importance of}} electricity are quite obvious. Due to her natural resources, Sweden had at an early stage developed many energy intensive industries such as iron and steel works and pulp and paper mills. She lacked, however, deposits of fossil fuels while the supply of water power was abundant. Hence, early on there was a strong stimulus to develop a system of generation and transmission of electrical power as well as to invest in <b>electrotechnical</b> <b>equipment.</b> Similarly, there was a strong stimulus {{to the development of a}} domestic electrotechnical engineering industry. This industry became a backbone of the more sophisticated manufacturing that spurred Swedish industrialization from the 1890 s onwards. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{extremely}} low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields (MFs) were measured during the temperature-rise test of various <b>electrotechnical</b> <b>equipment.</b> The number of workers subjected to magnetic fields from the temperature-rise test is small; however, the exposure can be significant as the testing currents {{can be in the}} order of hundreds amperes. The resultant magnetic field during testing can exceed the ICNIRP limits for occupational exposure. The magnetic field exposure was recorded and statistical measures were extracted for three electrotechnical apparatus. It was found that the Time-Weighted Average exposure per unit current can reach 0. 0598 μT/A. Additionally, in order to mitigate the exposure, a rule of thumb regarding safety distances has been proposed. It is shown that the use of this rule of thumb can reduce the magnetic field exposure. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
