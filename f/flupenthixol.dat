40|$|Here we {{attempted}} to clarify the role of dopamine signaling in reward seeking. In Experiment 1, we assessed {{the effects of the}} dopamine D 1 /D 2 receptor antagonist <b>flupenthixol</b> (0. 5 mg/kg i. p.) on Pavlovian incentive motivation and found that <b>flupenthixol</b> blocked the ability of a conditioned stimulus to enhance both goal approach and instrumental performance (Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer). In Experiment 2 we assessed the effects of <b>flupenthixol</b> on reward palatability during post-training noncontingent re-exposure to the sucrose reward in either a control 3 -h or novel 23 -h food-deprived state. <b>Flupenthixol,</b> although effective in blocking the Pavlovian goal approach, was without effect on palatability or the increase in reward palatability induced by the upshift in motivational state. This noncontingent re-exposure provided an opportunity for instrumental incentive learning, the process by which rats encode the value of a reward for use in updating reward-seeking actions. <b>Flupenthixol</b> administered prior to the instrumental incentive learning opportunity did not affect the increase in subsequent off-drug reward-seeking actions induced by that experience. These data suggest that although dopamine signaling is necessary for Pavlovian incentive motivation, it is not necessary for changes in reward experience, or for the instrumental incentive learning process that translates this experience into the incentive value used to drive reward-seeking actions, and provide further evidence that Pavlovian and instrumental incentive learning processes are dissociable...|$|E
40|$|Substance use, {{especially}} alcoholism, {{has been}} recognized as a significant problem in schizophrenic patients, though only a few studies {{on the effects of}} pharmacotherapy in these patients have been conducted so far. The thioxanthene neuroleptic <b>flupenthixol,</b> which can be given intramuscularly (i. m.) for improving compliance, has been studied as a possible anti-craving drug both in animal models of alcoholism and some clinical studies. Pilot studies suggest that comorbid schizophrenics with substance use may benefit from treatment with <b>flupenthixol.</b> Efficacy of <b>flupenthixol</b> (10 - 60 mg i. m.) in reducing alcohol consumption of dual diagnosis patients was studied in an open 6 -month clinical trial in 27 schizophrenics with comorbid alcoholism. Twenty-one patients entered the intention-to-treat analysis. Fourteen subjects were completers, 13 dropped out. Six patients completely abstained from alcohol during treatment. Alcohol consumption was significantly reduced compared to baseline (4 weeks before treatment as measured by timeline follow-back interview). In general, while patients showed a marked improvement concerning alcohol consumption, only a slight improvement in psychopathology was recorded. Overall tolerability was good. These data indicate a probable beneficial effect of <b>flupenthixol</b> in schizophrenic patients with comorbid alcoholism. Although the efficacy of <b>flupenthixol</b> as an anti-craving drug in dual diagnosis patients has to be explored in further studies, the drug may be considered a promising medication for these patients.

40|$|Background: It is {{well known}} that brain {{dopamine}} (DA) signals support risk-based decision making; however, the specific terminal regions of midbrain DA neurons through which DA signals mediate risk-based decision making are unknown. Methods: Using microinfusions of the D 1 /D 2 receptor antagonist <b>flupenthixol,</b> we sought to explore the role of D 1 /D 2 receptor activity in the rat orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and core and shell regions of the nucleus accumbens (AcbC and AcbS, respectively) in the regulation of risky choices. A risk-discounting task was used that involves choices between a certain small-reward lever that always delivered 1 pellet or a risky large-reward lever which delivered 4 pellets but had a decreasing probability of receiving the reward across 4 subsequent within-session trial blocks (100 %, 50 %, 25 %, 12. 5 %). To validate task sensitivity to experimental manipulations of DA activity, we also examined the effects of systemic amphetamine and <b>flupenthixol.</b> Results: Systemic amphetamine increased while systemic <b>flupenthixol</b> reduced risky choices. Results further demonstrate that rats that received intra-AcbC <b>flupenthixol</b> were able to track increasing risk associated with the risky lever but displayed a generally reduced preference for the risky lever across all trial blocks, including in the initial trial block (large reward at 100 %). Microinfusions of <b>flupenthixol</b> into the AcbS or OFC did not alter risk-based decision making. Conclusions: Our data suggest that intra-AcbC D 1 /D 2 receptor signaling does not support the ability to track shifts in reward probabilities but does bias risk-based decision making. That is, it increased the rats’ preference for the response option known to be associated with higher risk-related costs...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBurst firing {{has been}} {{reported}} as a pathological activity of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons in Parkinson's disease. However, the origin of bursts and their causal link with motor deficits remain unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that dopamine D 5 receptors (D 5 Rs), characterized by a high constitutive activity, {{may contribute to the}} emergence of burst firing in STN. We tested whether inhibiting D 5 R constitutive activity depresses burst firing and alleviates motor impairments in the 6 -OHDA rat model of Parkinson's disease. Intrasubthalamic microinjections of either an inverse agonist of D 5 Rs, <b>flupenthixol,</b> or a D 2 R antagonist, raclopride, were applied. Behavioral experiments, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological recordings, and ex vivo functional neuroanatomy studies were performed. Using [(5) S]GTPγ binding autoradiography, we show that application of <b>flupenthixol</b> inhibits D 5 R constitutive activity within the STN. Furthermore, <b>flupenthixol</b> reduced evoked burst in brain slices and converted pathological burst firing into physiological tonic, single-spike firing in 6 -OHDA rats in vivo. This later action was mimicked by calciseptine, a Cav 1 channel blocker. Moreover, the same treatment dramatically attenuated motor impairment in this model and normalized metabolic hyperactivity in both STN and substantia nigra pars reticulata, the main output structure of basal ganglia in rats. In contrast, raclopride as well as saline did not reverse burst firing and motor deficits, confirming the selective action of <b>flupenthixol</b> on D 5 Rs. These results are the first to demonstrate that subthalamic D 5 Rs are involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and that administering an inverse agonist of these receptors may lessen motor symptoms...|$|E

40|$|Although {{progress}} has been made identifying neural mechanisms underlying ethanol's primary reinforcing effects, few studies have examined the mechanisms mediating ethanol-induced conditioned effects. A recent lesion study suggests that expression of ethanol-conditioned behaviors depends upon an intact amygdala and nucleus accumbens core. However, specific mechanisms within these nuclei are unknown. In the present experiments, we used site-specific microinfusions of dopamine and NMDA receptor antagonists to examine the roles of accumbens and amygdala in the expression of ethanol conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice. In experiments 1 and 2, a D 1 /D 2 /D 3 receptor antagonist (<b>flupenthixol)</b> was infused into accumbens or amygdala before testing, while experiment 3 used pretest infusions of an NMDA antagonist (AP- 5) to examine the role of intra-accumbens NMDA receptors. Dopamine antagonism of accumbens was without effect, but intra-amygdala infusions of <b>flupenthixol</b> blocked CPP expression. Moreover, this effect was dependent upon dopamine antagonism within the basolateral nucleus but not the central nucleus of the amygdala. Antagonism of NMDA receptors in accumbens also blocked CPP expression. The present findings suggest that expression of the ethanol-conditioned response depends upon amygdala dopamine and accumbens NMDA receptors. These are the first studies in any species to show a role for amygdala dopamine receptors and the first studies in mice to implicate accumbens NMDA receptors in ethanol-induced conditioned effects.

40|$|Background Rats lever-press {{for access}} to running wheels {{suggesting}} that wheel running by itself is reinforcing. Furthermore, pairings of an episode of wheel running and subsequent confinement in a specific environment can establish a conditioned place preference (CPP). This finding implies that the reinforcing effects of wheel running outlast the actual occurrence of physical activity, a phenomenon referred to as aftereffect of wheel running. Aftereffect-induced CPP involves Pavlovian conditioning, i. e. repeated pairings of the aftereffect of wheel running with a specific environment creates a learned association between aftereffect and environment and, in turn, a preference for that environment. Given the involvement of dopamine systems in mediating effects of Pavlovian stimuli on appetitive behavior, a role of dopamine in mediating aftereffect-induced CPP seems plausible. Here we assessed whether the mixed D 1 /D 2 receptor antagonist <b>flupenthixol</b> (0. 25 mg/kg, i. p.) can block the expression of an aftereffect-induced CPP. Results In line with earlier studies, our results demonstrate that rats displayed a conditioned preference for environments paired with the aftereffect of wheel running and further show that the magnitude of CPP {{was not related to}} the wheel running rate. Furthermore, we found that <b>flupenthixol</b> (0. 25 mg/kg, i. p.) reduced locomotor activity but did not attenuate the expression of an aftereffect-induced CPP.

40|$|BACKGROUND: European Medicines Agency {{guidelines}} recognize {{two different}} treatment goals for alcohol dependence: abstinence and reduction in alcohol consumption. All currently approved agents are indicated for abstinence. This systematic review aimed to identify drugs in development for alcohol dependence treatment and to establish, based upon trial design, if any are seeking market authorization for reduction in consumption. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase (December 2001 -November 2011) to identify agents in development for alcohol dependence treatment. Additional studies {{were identified by}} searching ClinicalTrials. gov and the R&D Insight and Clinical Trials Insight databases. Studies in which the primary focus was treatment of comorbidity, or n≤ 20, were excluded. Studies were then classified as 'abstinence' if they: described a detoxification/alcohol withdrawal period; enrolled patients who had undergone detoxification previously; or presented relapse/abstinence rates as the primary outcome. Studies in patients actively drinking at baseline were classified as 'reduction in consumption'. RESULTS: Of 602 abstracts identified, 45 full-text articles were eligible. Five monotherapies were in development for alcohol dependence treatment: topiramate, fluvoxamine, aripiprazole, <b>flupenthixol</b> and nalmefene. Nalmefene was the only agent whose sponsor was clearly seeking definitive approval for reduction in consumption. Development status was unclear for topiramate, fluvoxamine, aripiprazole and <b>flupenthixol.</b> Fifteen agents were examined in published exploratory investigator-initiated trials; the majority focused on abstinence. Ongoing (unpublished) trials {{tended to focus on}} reduction in consumption.

40|$|Dopamine (DA) modifies {{the motor}} pattern {{generated}} by the pyloric network in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus, by directly acting {{on each of the}} circuit neurons. The 14 pyloric neurons fall into six cell types, and DA actions are cell type specific. The transient potassium current mediated by shal channels (IA) is a common target of DA modulation in most cell types. DA shifts the voltage dependence of IA in opposing directions in pyloric dilator (PD) versus lateral pyloric (LP) neurons. The mechanism(s) underpinning cell-type specific DA modulation of IA is unknown. DA receptors (DARs) can be classified as type 1 (D 1 R) or type 2 (D 2 R). D 1 Rs and D 2 Rs are known to increase and decrease intracellular cAMP concentrations, respectively. We hypothesized that the opposing DA effects on PD and LP IA were due to differences in DAR expression patterns. In the present study, we found that LP expressed somatodendritic D 1 Rs that were concentrated near synapses but did not express D 2 Rs. Consistently, DA modulation of LP IA was mediated by a Gs-adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-protein kinase A pathway. Additionally, we defined antagonists for lobster D 1 Rs (<b>flupenthixol)</b> and D 2 Rs (metoclopramide) in a heterologous expression system and showed that DA modulation of LP IA was blocked by <b>flupenthixol</b> but not by metoclopramide. We previously showed that PD neurons express D 2 Rs, but not D 1 Rs, thus supporting the idea that cell specific effects of DA on IA are due to differences in receptor expression...|$|E

In the present set of experiments the role of DA within the mPOA on the full cascade of female sexual behaviour is investigated. Ovariectomized female rats were bilaterally cannulated into the mPOA and hormonally primed either fully, with estradiol benzoate (EB) and progesterone (P), or partially with EB-alone. Since it was hypothesized that DA plays a facilitative role in female sexual behaviour, a nonselective DA receptor, and selective DA Dl and D 2 receptor agonists (apomorphine, SKF 38393 and quinpirole, respectively) were infused to EB-alone females and nonselective DA receptor, and selective DA Dl and D 2 receptor antagonists (<b>flupenthixol,</b> SCH 23390, and raclopride, respectively) were infused to EB+P rats. Copulatory behaviour was then immediately tested over a period of thirty minutes in a bilevel chamber with a sexually experienced male. Precopulatory behaviours were increased in EB-alone females following infusions of a low dose (0. 25 æg) of apomorphine and both a low (0. 05 æg) and a high dose (0. 2 æg) of quinpirole. Hops and/or darts were decreased following infusion of a low dose (0. 05 æg) of SKF 38393.

40|$|Psychiatrists ' {{consensus}} {{statement on the}} use of high-dose antipsychotics were audited. The baseline survey and two completed audit cycles are described showing improvement in the monitoring and management of out-patients on higher dose depot antipsychotics. Initially the main problem was poor attendance at hospital appointments. Practice was changed by (a) medical staff becoming more assertive and visiting non-attenders at home; (b) a phlebotomist visiting patients at home. Deinstitutionalisation has relocated many patients with chronic psychoses into the community, but services, including the ancillary services, have sometimes been slow to follow. This audit found that the most effective change was the provision of services to patients in their own home. The Royal College of Psychiatrists ' {{consensus statement}} {{on the use of}} high-dose antipsychotic medication (Thompson, 1994) suggested that it should be used to set local standards that could then be audited. High doses are known to increase side-effects, but there is no clearly established relationship with sudden death (Kane. 1994) despite public concern (Hirsh & Barnes, 1994). The evidence for efficacy of high doses is limited and not supported by controlled studies (Thompson, 1994), but the possibility that some patients may benefit has not been ruled out (Kane, 1994). Cookson (1987) reported that, in a group of patients who were thought to have improved on a higher dose, there was increased relapse when the dose was reduced. The consensus statement denned 'high dose' as a total daily dose which exceeded the advisory upper limit for general use in the British National Formulary (BNF) or product licence. Warner et al (1995) highlighted the problem of deciding whether a patient is on high-dose antipsychotics, for the purpose of audit, using the abovedefinition. 'Higher dose ' in this paper is denned as equivalent to a depot dose of <b>flupenthixol</b> 200 mg fortnightly or greater. This dose is well within the BNF limit for <b>flupenthixol</b> but is around the BNF limit for equivalent doses of the other depot antipsychotics (British Medica...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} {{relative}} efficacies of clozapine plus Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) compared against non-clozapine typical and atypical antipsychotics plus ECT {{for the treatment}} of âTreatment Resistant Schizophreniaâ (TRS). Primarily to assess if clozapine delivers a significant improvement over other antipsychotics when combined with ECT. Design: Major electronic databases were searched between 1990 and March 2017 for trials measuring the effects of either clozapine augmented ECT, other antipsychotic-augmented ECT, or both. After the systematic review of the data, a random-effects meta-analysis was conducted measuring the relative effect sizes of the different treatment regimens. Subjects: 1179 patients in 23 studies reporting the usage of ECT augmentation with antipsychotics. A total of 95 patients were tested with clozapine, and ECT (9 studies) and 1084 patients were tested with non-clozapine antipsychotics (14 studies) such as <b>flupenthixol,</b> chlorpromazine, risperidone, sulpiride, olanzapine, and loxapine with concurrent ECT treatment considered for systematic review. Of these, 13 studies reported pre and post-treatment scores were included in the meta-analysis. Main outcome measures: The main outcome measure was the presence and degree of both positive and negative psychotic symptoms, as measured by either of two standardized clinician administered tests, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). Results: The comparison of the different antipsychotics established the supremacy of ECT-augmented clozapine treatment against other typical and atypical antipsychotics. The Forest Plot revealed that the overall standard mean difference was 0. 891 for non-clozapine studies and 1. 504 for clozapine studies, at a 95 % interval. Furthermore, the heterogeneity plots showed that while clozapine studies showed no significant heterogeneity, non-clozapine studies showed an I 2 statistic value at 42. 19 %, suggesting moderate heterogeneity. Lastly, publication bias showed asymmetrical plots and significant values of Kendal's tau and Egger's rank test. Conclusion: ECT augmentation technique was found to be effective in the reduction of psychometric scale scores, and the resulting improvement was significant. Clozapine maintained its stance as the most effective treatment for Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia, followed by <b>flupenthixol.</b> Keywords: Evidence-based medicine, Psychiatr...|$|E
40|$|Regional rat brain uptake of [18 F]GBR 13119, a high {{specific}} activity, positron-emitter labeled {{derivative of}} the potent dopamine uptake antaqonist GBR 12935, is reported. Striat~n to cerebellum ratios of 3 are obtained at 90 minutes post injection. Specific binding in stri-atum can be blocked by pretreatment with dopamine uptake system an-tagonists (mazindol, nomifensine) {{but not with}} receptor antagonists (spiperone, <b>flupenthixol).</b> [18 F]GBR 13119 is proposed as a new posi-tron-emitting radioligand for in vivo PET studies of the pre-synaptic dopamine uptake system. Dysfunctions of the brain dopaminergic system have been demonstrated as the underlying biochemical change in certain neurological diseases (Parkinson's disease) (i) and have been implicated in psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia) (2). The study of the dopamine system in vivo using Positron Emission Tomo-graphv (PET) has been vigorously pursued. Most PET studies of dopamine receptor pharmacology have centered on measurements of the number (Bmax) and affinit...|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{specific}} and stability-indicating reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method {{was developed for}} the simultaneous determination of melitracen hydrochloride and flupentixol dihydrochloride in tablet dosage form. A Brownlee C- 18, 5 [*]μm column having 250 × 4. 6 [*]mm i. d. in isocratic mode, with mobile phase containing 0. 025 [*]M potassium dihydrogen phosphate: methanol (10 [*]:[*] 90, v/v; pH 7. 3) was used. The flow rate was 1. 0 [*]mL/min, and effluents were monitored at 230 [*]nm. The retention times of melitracen hydrochloride and flupentixol dihydrochloride were 7. 75 [*]min and 5. 50 [*]min, respectively. The linearity for melitracen hydrochloride and flupentixol dihydrochloride were {{in the range of}} 0. 5 – 60 [*]μg/mL. The recoveries obtained for melitracen hydrochloride and <b>flupenthixol</b> dihydrochloride was 99. 81 – 100. 77 % and 99. 42 – 100. 12 %, respectively. Both the drugs were subjected to acid and alkali hydrolysis, chemical oxidation, and dry heat degradation and photodegradation. The proposed method was validated and successfully applied to the estimation of melitracen hydrochloride and flupentixol dihydrochloride in combined tablet dosage form...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether morphological brain changes {{occurred in}} brain regions associated with body-weight homeostasis during acute antipsychotic treatment, and if so, {{whether they were}} related to changes in body mass and metabolic profile. Twenty-two antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode schizophrenia received either risperidone long acting injection or <b>flupenthixol</b> decanoate over 13 weeks and were compared by structural MRI with 23 matched healthy volunteers at weeks 0, 4 and 13. Images were reconstructed using freesurfer fully-automated whole brain segmentation. The ventral diencephalon and prefrontal cortex were selected to represent the homeostatic and hedonic food intake regulatory systems respectively. Body mass was measured at weeks 0, 7 and 13 and fasting glucose and lipid profiles at weeks 0 and 13. Linear mixed effect models indicated significant group(⁎) time interactions for the ventral diencephalon volumes bilaterally. Ventral diencephalon volume reduction was strongly correlated bilaterally with body mass increase and HDL-cholesterol reductions, and unilaterally with blood glucose elevation. There were no significant changes in prefrontal cortical thickness. These findings implicate the ventral diencephalon, of which the hypothalamus is the main component, in the acute adipogenic and dyslipidaemic effects of antipsychotic medication...|$|E
