5|$|Meyerbeer's large choral 'tableaux' {{also made}} a major {{contribution}} to the overall dramatic effect; the composer particularly sought opportunities to write such large-scale crowd scenes, and preferred libretti which offered such possibilities.

Forty-six animal health experts participated in the survey and were asked to score clinical signs and risk factors from a list of 34. The top five signs / risk factors for diagnosis of anaplasmosis included, constipation, anaemia, pallor, pyrexia, depression and anorexia. <b>For</b> babesiosis, <b>they</b> included, haemoglobinuria, pyrexia, icterus, anaemia and depression. <b>For</b> cowdriosis, <b>they</b> included, ataxia, pyrexia, anorexia, abnormal behaviour and depression. <b>For</b> fasciolosis, <b>they</b> included, weightloss, pallor, weakness, submandibular oedema and rough coat. <b>For</b> PGE, <b>they</b> included, potbelly, diarrhoea, anaemia, stunted growth and age. <b>For</b> schistosomosis, <b>they</b> included weightloss, pallor, weakness, anaemia and stunted growth. <b>For</b> theileriosis, <b>they</b> included lymph node enlargement, pyrexia, age, breed and reduced milk yield. <b>For</b> trypanosomosis, <b>they</b> included, anaemia, weightloss, staring coat, lymph node enlargement and pallor.

5|$|Along {{with the}} book {{mentioned}} above, in 1908 Leo Tolstoy wrote A Letter to a Hindu, which said that only by using love as a weapon through passive resistance could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish A Letter to a Hindu in Gujarati. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy's death in 1910 (Tolstoy's last letter was to Gandhi). The letters concern practical and theological applications of nonviolence. Gandhi saw himself a disciple of Tolstoy, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> agreed regarding opposition to state authority and colonialism; both hated violence and preached non-resistance. However, they differed sharply on political strategy. Gandhi called for political involvement; he was a nationalist and was prepared to use nonviolent force. He was also willing to compromise. It was at Tolstoy Farm where Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach systematically trained their disciples {{in the philosophy of}} nonviolence.|$|E

His relationship with the People's Republic of China was far warmer, as the Chinese Marxist government supplied ZANLA with armaments without any conditions.

5|$|Relations had {{apparently}} warmed between Tyndall and Jordan, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> met {{up after the}} latter {{was released from prison}} in 1968, and Tyndall again met with Jordan in Coventry in 1972, there inviting him to join the NF. However, a poor showing in the February 1974 general election resulted in Tyndall being challenged by two groups within the party, the 'Strasserites' and the 'Populists', the latter of whom were largely Powellite ex-members of the Conservative Party. The Populist challenge was successful and in October 1974 Tyndall was replaced as chairman by John Kingsley Read. Tyndall then used Spearhead as a vehicle to criticise rival factions with the NF. As a result, he was expelled from the party during a disciplinary tribunal in November 1975. Tyndall took the issue to the high court, who overturned the expulsion. The 'Populists' then left the party, splitting to form the National Party in January 1976, which for a short time proved more electorally successful than the NF. Back in the party and with his main rivals gone, Tyndall regained the position of chairman.|$|E

5|$|The {{defeat and}} death of Richard III at Bosworth field was a double blow for the heralds, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> lost both their patron, the King, and their benefactor, the Earl Marshal, who was also slain. The victorious Henry Tudor was crowned King Henry VII soon after the battle. Henry's first Parliament of 1485 passed an Act of Resumption, in which large grants of crown {{properties}} made by his two predecessors to their supporters were cancelled. Whether this act affected {{the status of the}} College's charter is debatable; however, the act did facilitate the de facto recovery of Coldharbour to the crown. Henry then granted the house to his mother Lady Margaret Beaufort, for life. This was because it was supposed that the house was granted personally to John Writhe the Garter King of Arms and not to the heralds as a corporation. As a result, the heralds were left destitute and many of their books and records were lost. Despite this ill treatment from the King, the heralds' position at the royal court remained, and they were compelled by the King to attend him at all times (albeit in rotation).|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the knee}} injury, Croyle {{received}} interest from members the Southeastern Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference, including Louisiana State and Florida State. Croyle showed interest in playing for Florida State {{due in part}} because of the team's offensive coordinator, Mark Richt. Croyle initially showed little interest in playing for Alabama after their head coach, Mike DuBose had recently been fired, but once Richt took the head coaching job with the Georgia Bulldogs, Croyle followed in his father's footsteps. On the night before he was to announce his college decision to play for Florida State, Croyle announced that he would instead play for the Alabama Crimson Tide. Interestingly enough, the Crimson Tide were not fazed by Croyle’s rather serious ligament tear, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> felt he would heal well enough that his talent still warranted a spot on the roster. Croyle graduated early from high school and enrolled at the University of Alabama in January 2001. After red-shirting his freshman year at Alabama, Croyle earned a spot as the top backup in his second season behind senior starter Tyler Watts. Croyle's coaches voted for him as the Ozzie Newsome Most Improved Freshman after starting two games in 2002. After the 2002 season, Alabama head coach Dennis Franchione resigned to take the same position at Texas A. Washington State head coach Mike Price was hired to replace Franchione in January 2003.|$|E
