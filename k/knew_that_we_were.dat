500|$|McCartney {{summarised}} {{the importance}} of Epstein when he was interviewed in 1997 for a BBC documentary about Epstein, saying, [...] "If anyone was the Fifth Beatle, it was Brian". In his 1970 Rolling Stone interview, Lennon commented that Epstein's death {{marked the beginning of}} the end for the group: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in trouble then... I thought, 'We've had it now'". Thirty years after Epstein's death, McCartney said, [...] "Brian would really be happy to hear how much we loved him". The first contract between the Beatles and Epstein was auctioned in London in 2008, fetching £240,000.|$|E
500|$|On 25 June 1967, the Beatles {{performed}} their forthcoming single, [...] "All You Need Is Love", to {{an estimated}} 350 million viewers on Our World, the first live global television link. Released a week later, during the Summer of Love, the song was adopted as a flower power anthem. Two months later, the group suffered a loss that threw their career into turmoil. Having been introduced to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi only the previous night in London, on 25 August they travelled to Bangor for his Transcendental Meditation retreat. Two days later, their manager's assistant, Peter Brown, phoned to inform them that Epstein, only thirty-two years old, had died. The coroner ruled the death an accidental carbitol overdose, although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide. Epstein {{had been in a}} fragile emotional state, stressed by personal issues. His death left the group disoriented and fearful about the future. Lennon recalled: [...] "We collapsed. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in trouble then. I didn't really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared. I thought, 'We've had it now.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{supposed to have}} been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology. In 1997, during pre-production on Henry Selick's feature, Monkeybone, the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors. After finishing Monkeybone, Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally. In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion; the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot. Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital. After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera, the Canon EOS-1D Mark II, an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm). Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: [...] "One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super 35 film negative, so we could use Nikon lenses and treat them like regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect—the same depth of field and angle of coverage. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1980 {{fan club}} interview, Holder {{spoke of the}} album. [...] "Over {{the last couple of}} years me and Jim have been writing a lot of songs, but we haven't known which way to {{approach}} them really. With Return to Base we were really pleased with the album, we thought that it turned out really well, but it didn't sell. Everyone around the band was saying to us that we weren't coming up with as good songs as we used to, but me and Jim <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> we <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> coming up with strong songs. Some of the songs on Return to Base we thought were some of the best songs that we'd ever written. There only seemed to be me and Jim that had confidence in the songs; people like Chas, Dave and Don said that they didn't think our songs were as strong, some of them they did but some of them they didn't. But we ourselves thought that they were. Thus it was a case of getting the album down; and in our minds it turned out to be a great album." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another Verhoeven film—the erotic thriller Basic Instinct (1992)— {{she took}} on the role that made her a star, playing Catherine Tramell, a brilliant, bisexual, alleged serial killer. Several actresses at the time turned down the role, mostly because of the nudity required. In the film's most notorious scene, Tramell is being {{questioned}} by the police, and she crosses and uncrosses her legs, exposing her vulva, which is not covered by underwear. According to Stone, she agreed to film the flashing scene with no underwear, and although she and Verhoeven had discussed the scene {{from the beginning of}} production, she was unaware just how explicit the infamous shot would be: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to do this leg-crossing thing and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to allude to the concept that I was nude, but I did not think that you would see my vagina in the scene. Later, when I saw it in the screening I was shocked. I think seeing it {{in a room full of}} strangers was so disrespectful and so shocking, so I went into the booth and slapped him and left". Stone claimed in an earlier interview, however, that [...] "it was so fun" [...] watching the film for the first time with strangers. Verhoeven has denied all claims of trickery and said, [...] "As much as I love her, I hate her, too, especially after the lies she told the press about the shot between her legs, which was a straight lie". Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, who later befriended the actress, also claimed in his memoir, Hollywood Animal, that the actress was fully aware of the level of nudity involved.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2004 Daymond told WHAMMO.com.au [...] "I think [...] <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{looking to}} do {{something}} a little different. As a company they'd just gone through some major infrastructure changes {{in the last few}} years and I think by talking to us and realising that we were maybe not as happy as we were on the label when we signed – that the label had changed a lot and the roster was completely different". In an interview for Rolling Stone in May 2011, Thornton told music journalist, Andrew McMillen, that the band's manager at the time [...] "couldn’t be fucked fighting the label for anything that we wanted, and he'd made the decision that we were just going to go with whatever the label reckoned. Near the end, it was fucking soul-destroying for me".|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to break up}} {{came as a surprise}} to many in the industry who believed Bardot {{was in the process of}} establishing a strong and credible reputation. Rumours circulated that the split was a result of Monk's desire to begin a solo career, though she denied this. In 2004, during an interview with FHM magazine, Polihronas revealed, [...] "I think when Sophie went solo, everyone assumed that it was she who broke up the band, which wasn't right. I don't know whether I should say this, but I wanted out for a long time. Sophie and I both <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to fulfil the last album and then move on, but Sophie stayed with the management, and continued on. I took a whole year off without even thinking about it." [...] Soon after Bardot's split, Wood confirmed that at the time, both she and Chapple were the two members keen to continue as Bardot. In 2013, an unreleased track titled [...] "Honesty", written by Chapple and Play It Like That collaborator [...] Michael D'Arcy leaked onto the internet, with lyrics stating a [...] "little girl who wants to sing all the songs / a little blonde caught up in the show" [...] not being honest. [...] This is rumoured to be Chapple's response to Monk starting her solo career at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Star Trek went to {{series on}} the basis of the second pilot, but still fearing {{blacklash}} against Spock's ears, and issues with selling the show to stations in the Bible Belt, NBC airbrushed out the pointed tips in an advertising brochure about the series. Spock's role was used as audition material for new cast members. Nichelle Nichols was intrigued by the role when she read his lines, and asked why the character could not be female. The producers response was that Nimoy would not like it. It was during the filming of the first non-pilot episode to be shot, [...] "The Corbomite Maneuver", that under the direction of Joseph Sargent, Nimoy was directed to remain aloof during a tense moment and said the catchphrase [...] "fascinating" [...] for the first time. This moment was subsequently given by the writing staff as an example of how the character should act. Nimoy liked Spock's newly logical nature, observing that the character is [...] "struggling to maintain a Vulcan attitude, a Vulcan philosophical posture and a Vulcan logic, opposing what was fighting him internally, which was human emotion". Nimoy stated that after [...] "The Naked Time", in which a disease causes Spock to cry, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not playing a man with no emotions, but a man who had great pride, who had learned to control his emotions and who would deny that he knew what emotions were. In a way, he was more human than anyone else on the ship." ...|$|E
