40|$|More {{powerful}} managers {{make more}} important decisions. Therefore, firm performance is more informative about {{the abilities of}} such managers, who, realizing {{that they are more}} visible, are more eager to improve performance. If this reputation effect exists, how should firms allocate power? I analyze the optimal allocation of power and derive implications for several issues that often arise in management practice: the choice of <b>departmentation</b> criteria, the importance given to seniority, and the width of job definitions. Finally, I show that the model is consistent with the empirical evidence on managerial succession. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{some key}} {{structural}} and design dimensions of organizations {{and how they}} apply to electronic business and the virtual organization. The paper reviews the relevant literature on design of electronic commerce organizations. Although few studies have dealt with these issues, the paper highlights some research questions that emerge from the literature, and examines selected dimensions, such as formalization, <b>departmentation,</b> and inter-organizational relations. The paper concludes that electronic commerce organizations are faced primarily with design issues, so that conventional knowledge of structural dimensions is highly applicable to this new business phenomenon.

40|$|THERE is {{no doubt}} that subject depart-mentation {{has become one of the}} most {{significant}} forms of public library organi-zation. O v e r seven million people live in the areas served by the nine public libraries which are organized entirely on the basis of subject departments. M a n y millions more live in the areas served by additional public libraries which have at least one sub-ject department each. Since 1924, with the notable exception of Philadelphia, virtually every major public library build-ing erected in this country has been very largely or entirely a subject-departmental-ized library. T h e purposes of this study are to clarify the meaning of subject <b>departmentation,</b> to summarize its historical development, to in-dicate the problems involved in the plan, and to develop a body of principles for the guidance of administrators of subject-de-partmentalized libraries. A l though it is primarily concerned with public libraries, the discussion has relevance to the academic library as wel l. In the preparation of this study, the first step was to survey the litera-ture on the topic, including annual reports of departmentalized libraries. T h e writ-ings of Barton, M c D i a r m i d, M a r t i n and Phelps should be mentioned as being espe-cially noteworthy. 1 O n the basis of this 1 See the following: Barton, M. "Administrative Problems in Reference Work. " In The Reference Function of the Library, p. survey it was possible to gain some idea of the historical development of subject de-partmentation. It was also possible to con-struct a checklist of what appeared to be the major problems and principles involved in subject <b>departmentation.</b> T h e checklist was submitted in the form of a rating sheet to a group of librarians now working in departmentalized libraries in order to se-cure their judgments as to the importance of the problems and the validity of the principles. A total of 53 replies was re-ceived from the top administrators and subject department heads in five depart...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. Military project management {{for the production}} phase of system acquisition is discussed. A management framework based on analysis of five principles—planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling—is constructed. Organization alternatives for production management are proposed to the Aegis Weapon System Project Manager, who sponsored this research. The results of this analysis indicate that when a project manager's background is categorized as being operational, administrative or technical, significant conclusions can be drawn concerning {{the characteristics of the}} project manager best suited to manage the production phase and the structure of his production organization. Investigation also revealed that the primary functions of military project organizations in the Production phase of system acquisition are: Business Management, Systems Engineering, Production Control, Quality and Testing, and Fleet Support. <b>Departmentation</b> along these functional lines during the Production phase of system acquisition appears to reflect the economic division of work in the military project organization.

40|$|Building on {{the idea}} of {{asymmetric}} adaptability, this study focused on structural and compositional ways to arrange teams in order to maximize both initial performance and structural adaptability. Based on 64 teams that completed a command and control simulation, our results suggest that hybrid teams (teams structured using non-redundant, complimentary elements of both <b>departmentation</b> and centralization) were able to perform well initially and successfully shift structures, while teams structured in traditionally mechanistic and organic manners were not. Furthermore, high mean levels of emotional stability and extraversion helped to ease the difficult transition from organic to mechanistic team structures. The nature of jobs and organizational life is changing. Jobs are no longer static and the external environments that organizations have to deal with are becoming turbulent and unpredictable (Ilgen & Pulakos, 1999). Because of this, organizations need flexibility and the ability to perform well in different environments and situations. At the same time, competitive pressures faced by organizations are also mounting, which puts efficiency requirements at the center of most discussions of organizational design. Finally, many organizations are shiftin...|$|E
40|$|The chapter {{analyses}} and compares {{the integration of}} employment and social policies {{at the local level}} in three major Italian cities (Naples, Rome and Milan). The chapter departs from the modes of governance of integrated activation policies to highlight the importance of <b>departmentation</b> and the relative organisational reforms that shape bureaucratic structures. It analyses how different institutional contexts and local specificities influence the local governance of activation and highlights good and innovative practices of organizing services for active social cohesion policy. The theoretical and methodological approach developed by the LOCALISE project is deployed to analyse the Italian cases, so to identify and compare methods and practices of integration in each case. The barriers to and enablers of integration are explored and good practices in achieving multi-level, multi-dimensional and multi-stakeholder integration are presented, showing that the public administration governance model characterises all Italian cities with limited variations. The chapter underlines that in Italy the multi-dimensional divide exacerbates the multi-level divide, following similar administrative divisions. It then highlights three specific features, relates to the weak possibility of multi-dimensional integration within institutions. First, universality has been a core claim of social policies that only recently has come to be challenged as an effect of the economic crisis. Second, the principle of integration, especially with respect to the horizontal integration, is far from being fully considered in the political and administrative culture. Third, there is still a primacy of the political level over the administrative level and, even if the public bureaucracy has a key role in making and administering policies, it clearly enjoys limited discretion. In particular, the predominance of politics over administration {{is one of the main}} reasons for which, in all the three cases studies clearly surfaced a highly fragmented picture with respect to multi-dimensional integration that impact also on the multi-level coordination. Indeed, it clearly emerges that Italian local bureaucracies are working by “organ pipes” so that each department usually follows its own routines autonomously, trying not to interfere with others, in order to avoid (or deepen the already existent) political competition with other departments or levels. Furthermore, since politics often aims at building consensus, some politicians develop their objectives autonomously, rather than as the result of top-down coordination among the different public officials and bottom-up initiatives deploying the expertise of apical bureaucrats...|$|E
