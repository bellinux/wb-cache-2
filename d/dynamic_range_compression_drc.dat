40|$|The performance, reliability, and {{ubiquity of}} {{automatic}} speech recognition systems has flourished in recent years due to steadily increasing computational power and technological innovations such as hidden Markov models, weighted finite-state transducers, and deep learning methods. One problem which plagues speech recognition systems, especially those that operate offline and have been trained on specific in-domain data, is the deleterious effect of noise on the accuracy of speech recognition. Historically, robust speech recognition {{research has focused on}} traditional noise types such as additive noise, linear filtering, and reverberation. This thesis describes the effects of nonlinear <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> on {{automatic speech recognition}} and develops a number of novel techniques for characterizing and counteracting it. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> is any function which reduces the <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of an input signal. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> is a widely-used tool in audio engineering and is almost always a component of a practical telecommunications system. Despite its ubiquity, this thesis is the first work to comprehensively study and address the effect of <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> on speech recognition. More specifically, this thesis treats the problem of <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> in three ways: (1) blind amplitude normalization methods, which counteract <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> when its parameter values allow the function to be mathematically inverted, (2) blind amplitude reconstruction techniques, i. e., declipping, which attempt to reconstruct clipped segments of the speech signal that are lost through non-invertible <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> <b>compression,</b> and (3) matched-training techniques, which attempt to select the pre-trained acoustic model with the closest set of compression parameters. All three of these methods rely on robust estimation of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> distortion parameters. Novel algorithms for the blind prediction of these parameters are also introduced. The algorithms 2 ̆ 7 quality is evaluated in terms {{of the degree to which}} they decrease speech recognition word error rate, as well as in terms of the degree to which they increase a given speech signal 2 ̆ 7 s signal-to-noise ratio.

In case the speech is dominant, the NR is less active and it is desirable to have as much DRC as possible, whereas in a noise dominant segment the NR is more active and the idea is not to compromise this operation by applying DRC. Experimental results confirmed that a serial concatenation of NR and DRC degrades the SNR improvement, and that the proposed solution offers a better SNR improvement compared to a serial concatenation. 1...|$|E

40|$|Some audio {{experts have}} {{proposed}} that using <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Range</b> <b>Compression</b> (<b>DRC)</b> to increase the loudness of music compromises audio quality. Conversely, in listening tests, researchers sometimes find that audio subjected to DRC is preferred over uncompressed audio. We test the hypothesis that it is DRC configuration, rather than the use of DRC per se, that determines listener preferences. In this study 130 listeners completed 13 A/B preference trials using pairs of RMS loudness-equalized stimuli subjected to different DRC configurations: viz., two magnitudes (heavy, moderate) and two compression types (limiting, compression) applied at three different points in the mix chain (track, subgroup, and master buss, here termed fullsum), along with an uncompressed control stimulus. Our results suggest that listeners prefer audio in which moderate compression {{has been applied to}} fewer signals simultaneously and dislike heavy limiting, particularly when applied to the full-sum, presumably because heavy DRC (and particularly limiting) applied to pre-mixed signals produces disagreeable distortion or because tracks whose amplitude characteristics would not have reached the DRC threshold alone may be deleteriously affected (e. g., attenuated) as a consequence of amplitude peaks in other tracks with which they are grouped...|$|E

40|$|Modern InfraRed (IR) cameras have High Dynamic Range (HDR) and {{excellent}} sensitivity. They collect images using {{a number of}} bits {{much higher than the}} 8 -bits used in displays or than those effectively perceived by the human visual system. In IR imagery, suitable techniques to display HDR images are therefore required in order to improve the visibility of the details while preserving the global perception of the scene. Visualization of HDR images has already been widely studied for visible-light images. In the IR framework only a few works have been proposed which tightly depend on the operating scenario and on the application of interest. In most cases such works have been obtained by modifications of methods proposed for visible light images rather than by developing visualization techniques taking into account the specific mechanism of IR image formation. In the literature, the techniques developed to display HDR images are mainly based on two approaches: contrast enhancement (CE) -oriented techniques and <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> (<b>DRC)</b> -oriented techniques. The former operate on image contrast to increase the perceptibility of details. The latter reduce the signal dynamic thus attenuating the large-scale intensity changes that do not contain relevant information. In addition, some of the proposed methods for HDR take advantage of both the approaches. In this work, a DRC approach is considered for visualization of HDR-IR images of maritime scenarios. A new method is presented that exploits clustering information and maps the output image according to the information content of each cluster by means of a suitable weighting function. The effectiveness of the presented technique is analyzed using IR images of a maritime scenario acquired in two different case studies. Moreover, the output images obtained with the proposed method are compared with those given by techniques previously proposed for visualization of IR images. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in terms of details enhancement, robustness against the horizon effect and presence of very warm objects. © (2012) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Traditionally used to control the dynamic range of signals and {{reduce the risk of}} {{overloading}} recording devices, over time it has developed into a creative colouration effect rather than a preventative measure. This thesis investigates sonic signatures, distortion, non-linearity and how audio material is coloured during the music production process. It explores how methodologies used to measure distortion and timbre can be used to define the sonic signature of hardware compressors and other pieces of music production equipment. A grounded theory and content analysis study was carried out to explore how producers use DRC in their work, how they describe its sound quality, which compressors they frequently use and which audio sources they process with particular types of compressor. The results from this qualitative study reveal that producers use compressors to manipulate the timbre of program material and select specific compressors with particular settings for colouration effects. Tests were carried out on a number of popular vintage hardware compressors to assess their sonic signature. Firstly, a comparative study was conducted on the Teletronix LA 2 A, Fairchild 670, Urei 1176 and dbx 165 A. Secondly a comprehensive in-depth analysis was undertaken of the 1176 to fully catalogue its sonic signature over a range of settings and to compare results from a vintage Urei Blackface 1176 and a modern Universal Audio reissue. Objective analysis was conducted on the compressors using Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), Intermodulation Distortion (IMD) and tone burst measurements. Complex program material was analysed using spectrum analysis, critical listening and audio feature extraction. It was found the compressors all have subtle nuances to their sonic signature as a result of elements in their design colouring the audio with non-linear artefacts. The 1176 was shown to impart significant amounts of distortion when used in its all-buttons mode and with fast attack and release configurations.

30|$|With the {{maturity}} {{of the surface}} roughness detection technology, all the thermal infrared imagers today have extremely high dynamic range (HDR), which can reach up to 14 bits or even higher (in this paper, 14  bits is adopted as an example) [1, 2]. The relatively high dynamic range ensures that the thermal imager can still clearly distinguish {{the details of the}} temperature change in the scene where the temperature change is extremely great [3 – 5]. However, high dynamic range can cause a mismatching issue between the original image captured and the back-end device [6, 7]. As the traditional back-end display and processing devices are all based on 8 -bit gray scale images, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> (<b>DRC)</b> of the adaptive image is a very important aspect in the back-end image processing of the thermal infrared imager [8 – 10]. The DRC processing technology has been greatly developed in recent years. Among them, the methods of automatic gain control (AGC) and histogram equalization (HE) have been most widely applied [11, 12]. The AGC method maps 14 -bit raw data linearly to 8 -bit pixel values after eliminating the interference noise [13, 14]. On the other hand, the HE distributes the gray level of the probability density function (PDF) of the original image to more output gray levels, while merging or compressing the relatively small gray levels of the PDF to enhance the DRC of the image and the contrast. However, the HE method also has some obvious defects [15]. In view of the insufficiency of AGC and HE processing methods in the detailed control [16], some of the more complex algorithms have also been developed [16 – 18]. With the increasing application of computer information technology, computer graphics-related knowledge has been used in many fields, such as film production, games, and computer-intelligent image enhancement,, where computer intelligent image enhancement technology has been applied. In most cases, the resolution of computer intelligent images is relatively high. Generally, the redundant information part needs be removed from the images to improve the efficiency and level of information processing. So far, many image enhancement algorithms are aimed at single, static computer-intelligent images, and there are relatively few studies on dynamically enhanced ones. Through the review of related literatures, it can be concluded that there are still many algorithms for image enhancement, which can be divided into vertex deletion, region merging, and repeated edge contraction specifically. Analysis shows that the most widely used is the edge contraction method. In such algorithm, an SAR framework is constructed based on the fusion of computer-intelligent images to achieve effective refinement of images on this basis. Most of the algorithms previously proposed were for static images, and the effects thus obtained were also very prominent. However, such algorithms fail to take the time consistency issue into full consideration. Hence, it is difficult to apply them directly to dynamic networks.|$|E
40|$|Hearing loss can {{be caused}} by many factors, e. g., daily {{exposure}} to excessive noise in the work environment and listening to loud music. Another important reason can be age-related, i. e., the slow loss of hearing that occurs as people get older. In general hearing impaired people suﬀer from a frequency-dependent hearing loss and from a reduced dynamic range between the hearing threshold and the uncomfortable level. This means that the uncomfortable level for normal hearing and hearing impaired people suﬀering from so called sensorineural hearing loss remains the same but the hearing threshold and the sensitivity to soft sounds are shifted {{as a result of the}} hearing loss. To compensate for this kind of hearing loss the hearing aid should include a frequency-dependent and a level-dependent gain. The corresponding digital signal processing (DSP) algorithm is referred to as <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> <b>compression</b> (<b>DRC).</b> Background noise (from competing speakers, traﬃc etc.) is also a signiﬁcant problem for hearing impaired people who indeed have more diﬃculty understanding speech in noise and so in general need a higher signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) than people with normal hearing. Because of this the noise reduction (NR) is also an important algorithmic component in hearing aids. Another issue in hearing aids is the undesired acoustic coupling between the loudspeaker and the microphone which is referred to as the acoustic feedback problem. Acoustic feedback produces an annoying howling sound and limits the maximum ampliﬁcation that can be used in the hearing aid without making it unstable. To tackle the acoustic feedback problem adaptive feedback cancellation (AFC) algorithms are used. Acoustic feedback is becoming an even more signiﬁcant problem due to the use of open ﬁttings and the decreasing distance between the microphone and the loudspeaker. In this thesis several DSP techniques are presented to address the problems introduced above. For the background noise problem, we propose a NR algorithm based on the speech distortion weighted multi-channel Wiener ﬁlter (SDW-MWF) that is designed to allow for a trade-oﬀ between NR and speech distortion. The ﬁrst contribution to the SDW-MWF based NR is based on using a weighting factor that is updated for each frequency and for each frame such that speech dominant segments and noise dominant segments can be weighted diﬀerently. This can be done by incorporating the conditional speech presence probability (SPP) in the SDW-MWF. The second contribution is based on an alternative and more robust method to estimate and update the correlation matrices, which is very important since an SDW-MWF based NR is uniquely based on these correlation matrices. The proposed SDW-MWF based NR shows better performance in terms of SNR improvement and signal distortion compared to a traditional SDW-MWF. For the problem of background noise and reduced dynamic range, we propose a combined algorithm of an SDW-MWF based NR and DRC. First the DRCis extended to a dual-DRC approach that allows for a switchable compression characteristic based on the conditional SPP. Secondly the SDW-MWF incorporating the conditional SPP is combined and analysed together with the dual-DRC. The proposed method shows that the SNR degradation can be partially controlled by using the dual-DRC. For the acoustic feedback problem, we propose a prediction error method based AFC (PEM-based AFC) exploiting an improved cascaded near-end signal model. The challenge in PEM-based AFC is to accurately estimate the near-end signal model such that the inverse of this model can be used as a decorrelation of the loudspeaker and the microphone signals. Due to the closed signal loop the loudspeaker and the microphone signal are now correlated which causes standard adaptive ﬁltering methods to fail. The proposed PEM-based AFC shows improved performance in terms of maximum stable gain (MSG) and ﬁlter misadjustment compared to a PEM-based AFC using a single near-end signal model. nrpages: 193 status: publishe...|$|E
