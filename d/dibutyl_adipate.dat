40|$|The {{industry}} {{under consideration}} uses chiefly the phthalate plasticizers: predominantly dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and higher alkyl phthalates (DAP- 789); periodically dioctyl phthalate (DOP), diisooctyl phthalate (DIOP), and {{benzyl butyl phthalate}} (BBP). Some formulations contain small amounts {{of one of the}} sebacates (dibutyl sebacate, DBS, or dioctyl sebacate, DOS) or adipates (<b>dibutyl</b> <b>adipate,</b> DBA, or dioctyl adipate, DOA). Tricresyl phosphate (TCP) was a component of the incombustible materials produced in 10 - 20 % of machines assigned to various workers. The literature data on the toxicity of phthalates are sparse and contradictory (1 - 9). In order to clarify the question of the possibility that chronic occupational intoxication could arise under manufacturing conditions and to ascertain the role of phthalate plasticizers in this connection, we studied 147 persons (87 women and 60 men), the majority of them (75 %) not more than 40 years old. The duration of occupational contact with the plasticizers was 1 / 2 -...|$|E
40|$|The paper reports {{viscosity}} {{measurements of}} compressed liquid dipropyl (DPA) and <b>dibutyl</b> (DBA) <b>adipates</b> obtained with two vibrating wire sensors developed in our group. The vibrating wire instruments were operated in the forced oscillation, or steady-state mode. The viscosity measurements of DPA {{were carried out}} {{in a range of}} pressures up to 18. MPa and temperatures from (303 to 333). K, and DBA up to 65. MPa and temperature from (303 to 373). K, covering a total range of viscosities from (1. 3 to 8. 3). mPa. s. The required density data of the liquid samples were obtained in our laboratory using an Anton Paar vibrating tube densimeter and were reported in a previous paper. The viscosity results were correlated with density, using a modified hard-spheres scheme. The root mean square deviation of the data from the correlation is less than (0. 21 and 0. 32) % and the maximum absolute relative deviations are within (0. 43 and 0. 81) %, for DPA and DBA respectively. No data for the viscosity of both adipates could be found in the literature. Independent viscosity measurements were also performed, at atmospheric pressure, using an Ubbelohde capillary in order to compare with the vibrating wire results. The expanded uncertainty of these results is estimated as ± 1. 5 % at a 95 % confidence level. The two data sets agree within the uncertainty of both methods. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|A {{correlation}} and predictive {{scheme for}} the viscosity and self-diffusivity of liquid dialkyl adipates is presented. The scheme {{is based on}} the kinetic theory for dense hard-sphere fluids, applied to the van der Waals model of a liquid to predict the transport properties. A "universal" curve for a dimensionless viscosity of dialkyl adipates was obtained using recently published experimental viscosity and density data of compressed liquid dimethyl (DMA), dipropyl (DPA), and <b>dibutyl</b> (DBA) <b>adipates.</b> The experimental data are described by the correlation scheme with a root-mean-square deviation of +/- 0. 34 %. The parameters describing the temperature dependence of the characteristic volume, V- 0, and the roughness parameter, R-eta, for each adipate are well correlated with one single molecular parameter. Recently published experimental self-diffusion coefficients of the same set of liquid dialkyl adipates at atmospheric pressure were correlated using the characteristic volumes obtained from the viscosity data. The roughness factors, R-D, are well correlated with the same single molecular parameter found for viscosity. The root-mean-square deviation of the data from the correlation is less than 1. 07 %. Tests are presented in order to assess the capability of the correlation scheme to estimate the viscosity of compressed liquid diethyl adipate (DEA) in a range of temperatures and pressures by comparison with literature data and of its self-diffusivity at atmospheric pressure in a range of temperatures. It is noteworthy that no data for DEA were used to build the correlation scheme. The deviations encountered between predicted and experimental data for the viscosity and self-diffusivity do not exceed 2. 0 % and 2. 2 %, respectively, which are commensurate with the estimated experimental measurement uncertainty, in both cases...|$|R
