5|$|Upon {{reading the}} paper, Jack sees an {{advertisement}} about the heir {{of the late}} Lord Stanley. He heads to Hotel Astor and learns that he has received his father's entire fortune. The lawyer accepts a dinner invitation at the wealthy American's house and brings along Jack. The father urges his daughter to win the affections of the rich, handsome and unmarried young Lord Stanley. Upon his arrival, the father who had shunned him is taken aback and greets him, but Ann refuses to <b>even</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the guest. She ignores him, and refuses to face him even as they head towards the dining room, but Jack attempts to kiss her and she pulls away. Suddenly, Ann sees it is Jack and embraces him with a kiss.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to <b>even</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the applications. With an order due out {{for one of}} Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor job because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E

Maria was christened three years later at the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in 1926. When Maria was 4, George Callas opened his own pharmacy, settling the family in Manhattan on 192nd Street in Washington Heights where Callas grew up.|$|E

A player may also go Blind Nil In The Dark where they never <b>even</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> their cards. This is scored the same as a Big Mo. Nil In The Dark is usually only bid if they have no trump cards.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} book, Dumbledore is demoted from Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, voted {{out of the}} Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards, and is almost {{stripped}} of his Order of Merlin First Class due to his speeches regarding the return of Voldemort, although it is reported that he is unconcerned {{as long as he}} is not taken off the Chocolate Frog cards. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Magic does everything they can to discredit him and Harry – mainly through the Daily Prophet. At the beginning of the book, Dumbledore enrages Fudge when he stops by at Harry's hearing with a witness (Arabella Figg) to ensure that he is not expelled. While Harry feels better when Dumbledore assists him, he becomes annoyed {{to the point of being}} angry that the headmaster refuses to speak to or <b>even</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
25|$|On May 30, 2000, {{after the}} New York Knicks beat the Indiana Pacers on Game 4 of the 2000 NBA Eastern Conference Finals, Francesa and Russo {{intended}} {{to board a}} plane to Indianapolis to host Mike and the Mad Dog there. However, the flight got cancelled and the next flight did not have first class seats available. Since Francesa only rode planes with first class seats, {{he walked away from}} the airport and went to the studio. This angered Russo and later that day Russo exploded during a close-door meeting with management. According to Russo, that was their worst fight ever. The duo didn’t talk, or <b>even</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> each other, during commercial breaks for 2 and a half months. Francesa said he went on vacation in the summer of 2000 and told WFAN to figure something out because he refused to work with Russo again when he returned.|$|E

25|$|The fables in {{the third}} book, as well as others, do not {{strictly}} limit to matters of war and peace. Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way. For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance {{so much that she}} refuses to <b>even</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps in the same bed with her back facing the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man. This thrills every limb of the old man. He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last. The aged man rises and profusely thanks the thief, requesting the intruder to take whatever he desires.|$|E
25|$|Shortly thereafter, a long battle {{began to}} return rail transit {{to the region}} and efforts for {{additional}} lines continue at a snail’s pace. It took 32 years to see the first line implemented. In 1972, the Regional Fixed Guideway Study for MTC proposed a $1.3 billion 37- or 57-mile (sources differ) heavy-rail rapid transit system, but the then-separate Metropolitan Council disagreed with that idea—refusing to <b>even</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the plan—and continuing political battles prevented its implementation. The Met Council had its own plans for bus rapid transit in the Cities. Another system using smaller people movers was proposed in the 1975 Small Vehicle Fixed Guideway Study and gained the most traction with the Saint Paul city council, but was eventually dropped in 1980. In the 1980s, light rail was proposed as an alternative and several possible corridors were identified, including the Central Corridor, for which a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) was drawn up in 1982. However, it was another two decades before the Blue Line light rail line began operation on June 26, 2004, by then, just over 50 years since the last regular-service streetcar ran on June 19, 1954, under the old Twin City Lines. Heavy-rail commuter service began on November 14, 2009, with the Northstar Line. The 2010s decade may finally see several new lines open.|$|E

Recalling the incident two years later, Emily wrote that [...] "it seemed to me I should die too if I could not be permitted to watch over her or <b>even</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her face." [...] She became so melancholic that her parents sent her to stay with family in Boston to recover. With her health and spirits restored, she soon returned to Amherst Academy to continue her studies.

500|$|In 1909 Lasker drew a short match (two wins, two losses) against Dawid Janowski, {{an all-out}} attacking Polish expatriate. Several months later {{they played a}} longer match in Paris, and chess historians still debate whether this was for the World Chess Championship. Understanding Janowski's style, Lasker chose to defend solidly so that Janowski {{unleashed}} his attacks too soon and left himself vulnerable. Lasker easily won the match 8–2 (seven wins, two draws, one loss). This victory was convincing for everyone but Janowski, who asked for a revenge match. Lasker accepted and they played a World Chess Championship match in Berlin in November–December 1910. Lasker crushed his opponent, winning 9½−1½ (eight wins, three draws, no losses). Janowski did not understand Lasker's moves, and after his first three losses he declared to Edward Lasker, [...] "Your homonym plays so stupidly that I cannot <b>even</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the chessboard when he thinks.

500|$|Walton of The Moving Picture News {{said the}} film was, [...] "A bright, clean, human {{interest}} tale. It holds the attention {{from beginning to}} end. A thoroughly commendable reel - in every way." [...] The Moving Picture World offers {{a summary of the}} work and was more or less neutral in its review of the film. The reviewer states, [...] "It is a romantic picture, affording ample opportunity for the imagination to run riot {{in a number of different}} directions. ... Much of human nature is disclosed in this film, even though it is, in a way, a travesty upon the way wealthy girls often fall in love with stablemen or others employed about their fathers' places." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was not very critical, but not offering any praise either. The reviewer highlighted the [...] "common fault of actors" [...] by throwing things on the floor and how Ann's refusal to <b>even</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the titled guest was overdone.|$|E

[...] For instance, she would not allow crew members to talk directly to her; they had to talk to her representatives, lest they distract her from the business at hand. She also forbade her dancers from speaking to her and her musicians were not permitted to <b>even</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her unless they were onstage with her. Moreover, when coming on and off the stage, Madonna demanded that road managers hold sheets around her in order to shield her from the eyes of [...] "those who couldn't help but stare". DeMann commented: [...] "She has a way of demanding that compels you to give her your undivided attention", to which Taraborrelli felt that such behavior actually was an indication of how successful and strong Madonna was. [...] "You don't {{behave like a}} bitch until you are that successful. The tour sure helped cement her star status", he commented.|$|E

500|$|Young Lord Stanley, {{possibly}} re-issued as His Only Son, is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced by}} the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Jack Stanley who is disinherited by this father, Lord Stanley, for refusing to marry his cousin. Jack heads to America and takes {{a job as a}} groom. He is dismissed from his position after his employer learns of Jack's affections for his daughter, Ann. Meanwhile, Lord Stanley decides to reinstate Jack in his will and then promptly dies, giving him his entire fortune. Jack reads of his father's death in the newspaper and learns of his father's will. The film concludes with the lawyer bringing Jack to a dinner party as [...] "Lord Stanley". Ann's father wishes for her to earn his affections, but she is defiant and does not <b>even</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him. Once she learns it his Jack, they kiss. The scenario was written by Lloyd Lonergan and the only known actor is Justus D. Barnes as Ann's father. A surviving print of the film exists in the Library of Congress and it shows the improvement of the Thanhouser interior sets over films from months prior. The film was released on October 25, 1910, and was met with mixed reviews.|$|E

He praised {{the size of the}} crowd, stating, [...] "There are four times as many people here than live in the town and more than the number that were here in 1960." [...] The candidate asserted that though his opponent, Vice President Humphrey, claimed that Americans had never had it so good, he should tell that to the farmer. Nixon pledged that he would give special attention to agricultural issues and would make the Secretary of Agriculture a farmer's advocate to the White House. He promised to restore order: [...] "The most important civil right is the right to be free from [...] violence." [...] He noted the many youths in the crowd, stating, [...] "Young Americans know their future is at stake. They don't want four more years of the same." [...] He recalled that his father had hailed from Ohio: [...] "his roots are here and mine are too!" [...] As Nixon spoke, Cole observed him, and thought he was a good family man, looking warm and friendly and appearing much as she expected him to. She later stated that she did not <b>even</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the sign until she was teased about it by a classmate, who suggested the sign, [...] "Bring Us Together Again" [...] was about boys, not politics. She kept the dress, but told the media she threw away the sign.|$|E
