40|$|<b>Greeting</b> card {{communication}} {{reflects the}} highly gendered division of both emotional and domestic labor in American culture. It’s generally thought that American {{men do not}} take as much responsibility for sending <b>greeting</b> cards as women, or display competence in this mode of communication, and both survey data and field work with <b>greeting</b> card consumers confirm this overall pattern. For many women, <b>greeting</b> card communication {{is part of a}} feminized habitus that includes kinship work as well as routine provisioning for the household. For men, taking an interest in <b>greeting</b> cards can seem like discrediting behavior for heterosexual masculinity, and so the belief that “men are bad at cards” circulates as one way of asserting gender difference. The <b>greeting</b> card industry reinforces this gendered view of <b>greeting</b> card communication, incorporating beliefs about gendered communication styles into its marketing, advertising, and card sentiments, and framing cards as a solution to the resulting communication gap. The feminization of <b>greeting</b> card communication illustrates the compulsion to view the world in gendered terms, and its contrast with the telephone, in which the telephone comes to seem the more “masculine” alternative, illustrates elasticity in attributions of gender appropriateness...|$|R
