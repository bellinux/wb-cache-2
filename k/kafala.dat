25|$|The <b>Kafala</b> system {{involves}} a sponsor {{who has the}} legal responsibility for a migrant domestic worker during a contract period, making the worker dependent upon the sponsor. The <b>Kafala</b> system is not legally binding in Lebanon because recruiters cannot act as a sponsor. Instead the system {{is made up of}} a number for administrative regulations, customary practices and legal requirements which bind the worker to the recruiter temporarily.. Once in Lebanon, the migrant domestic worker is assigned an employer. A worker may not change employer or break the terms of the contract unless the employer signs a release waiver. This must be done before a notary public and Lebanese authorities give an official release. A worker becomes illegal if they leave without the consent of their sponsor and the official release from the authorities. Human Rights Watch has said that the <b>Kafala</b> system in Lebanon puts workers at risk of exploitation and abuse, while Anti-Slavery International has said that the system {{is one of the major}} causes of vulnerability of migrant workers. The <b>Kafala</b> system means that the sponsor of the migrant domestic worker is legally responsible for the migrant and the state's responsibility for 'alien surveillance' is then passed on to the employer.|$|E
25|$|Human {{rights in}} Kuwait {{has been the}} subject of criticism, {{particularly}} regarding foreign workers' rights. Expatriates account for 70% of Kuwait's total population. The <b>kafala</b> system leaves foreign workers prone to exploitation. Kuwait has the most liberal labor laws in the GCC. As a result, the International Labour Organization(ILO) removed Kuwait from the list of countries violating workers rights.|$|E

25|$|According to the International Labour Organization {{there are}} 146,000 female migrant {{domestic}} workers {{employed in the}} UAE. In 2014 a Human Rights Watch report spoke to domestic workers who complained about abuse and not being paid due earnings, getting rest periods or days off and excessive workloads as well as documented cases of psychological, physical and sexual abuse. The report documents how the visa sponsorship system, or <b>kafala,</b> {{and the lack of}} labour protections leaves migrant workers exposed to abuse.|$|E
25|$|Lebanon has a {{gone through}} many stages in its {{absorbing}} of migrant workers, {{both before and}} after the Lebanese Civil War. This development has led to multiple problems regarding integration in Lebanese society. The ambiguity of the <b>Kafala</b> system in Lebanon has resulted in migrant domestic workers facing many legal issues and violations to their basic human rights. The government has largely been inactive and ineffective in implementing laws to protect migrant domestic workers but has attempted to manage the situation but to little avail.|$|E
25|$|When the {{employers}} {{were asked about}} the <b>kafala</b> system, 55.8% wanted the system to change. The {{reason for this is}} that {{the employers}} felt that the burden was too high on them. In fact the figure increased to 65% when the employers were informed of the obligation to reimburse the recruitment fees in case of an early termination of contract by the migrant workers. A large amount of the employers even felt that the migrant workers should not be included in the Lebanese labour code, out of fear of the expansion of these rights to other foreigners like the Syrian or Palestinian refugees.|$|E
25|$|Saudi Arabia and Qatar have an {{exit visa}} requirement, {{particularly}} for foreign workers. This {{is part of}} the <b>kafala</b> system, also present in Lebanon, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Kuwait, and Oman. Consequently, {{at the end of a}} foreign worker's employment period, the worker must secure clearance from their employer stating that the worker has satisfactorily fulfilled the terms of their employment contract or that the worker's services are no longer needed. The exit visa can also be withheld if there are pending court charges that need to be settled or penalties that have to be meted out.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the rights {{mentioned}} in an official contract, in practice the rights were ineffective. In the case of conflicts matters were often settled out of court, {{not only in the}} case of nonpayment of salary but also in the case of physical abuses. Under the <b>Kafala</b> system a domestic worker might be administratively detained in the event of fleeing the household of the employer. That in turn places the employer in a better position when negotiating the rights of the worker. As a result, the domestic workers often drop the charges against the employer or even refrain from filing a case before the court.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>kafala</b> system ties {{a migrant}} worker to their employers, who act as their {{sponsors}} {{and makes it}} difficult for them to change employers. If a domestic worker attempts to leave her sponsor before the end of her contract without her sponsor's approval she will be deemed to have [...] "absconded" [...] which usually results in fines and deportation.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2012, {{the number}} of migrant workers is {{estimated}} to be around 158,000 workers; however, these numbers may be inaccurate {{due to the fact that}} many workers come in unofficially. In the process of registering with an agency in their indigenous countries, 63% of the workers end up paying fees for the agency they apply through. When they do end up in Lebanon, the situation turns out different to what they had initially expected. [...] 6% of the workers were misled to believe that they would have other jobs than housework; jobs like security guards or hotel employees. The numbers get higher when it comes to matters of working hours and salaries, 53% of the employees received the salary they were promised. More figures are representing their very working status, 84% were not informed of their working hours, 78% did not receive any information on weekly days off, 64% were not aware of the household composition and 61% did not know whether they would be able to contact their families or not. Considering the figures presented above and the full scope of the <b>Kafala</b> system in Lebanon, as much as 83% of the surveyed said that they would not have traveled to Lebanon had they known of the situation beforehand.|$|E
2500|$|Employment {{agencies}} play three {{roles in}} the process: recruiter, immigration consultant and mediator. A labour recruiter can be either public or private and offers labour recruitment services. These businesses profit from the recruitment of migrants workers from one country and their allocation in jobs in another. Agents charge fees and commission for their services to migrant domestic workers. Sri Lankan migrant domestic worker pay an estimated $1300–1600 to a Lebanese agent while potential workers in the Philippines and Ethiopia pay between $2,400-3500 and $1,700-2100 respectively. [...] The Lebanese agent will also earn anything between $300 and 600 in commission in addition. This money covers travel costs, Lebanese government visa fees, and the agency fee. In some cases, the first three months' salary is signed away as payment. The agency fees {{cover the cost of}} airfare, government charges for issue of visas and agency commissions. The residency, work permit, notary fee and annual insurance are not included in the initial sum and are the responsibility of the employer sum which is calculated to US$500. There is a difference in the amount the agency receives for each group of workers depending on their country of origin. One example is the migrant workers from the Philippines who demand higher costs and monthly salaries because they have a good command of English, both spoken and written. They are deemed better educated and therefore are given a higher respect as maids than those from other countries. Some employment agencies contract migrant domestic worker out on short-term contracts at a cost of up to $450 per month. The high prices involved in recruiting a migrant domestic worker means that employers take precautions to make sure the worker does not leave their position before their contract is up. The migrant domestic worker is also required to make a deposit of $1,000 in a Lebanese back in order to cover return ticket home, which is never available to the worker. Because of the conditions present in Lebanon, legal and illegal agencies flourish and due to the <b>Kafala</b> system a migrant has to rely on agencies to find a Lebanese sponsor and employer.|$|E
5000|$|According to a 2008 HRW report, {{under the}} <b>kafala</b> system in Saudi Arabia, [...] "an {{employer}} assumes {{responsibility for a}} hired migrant worker and must grant explicit permission before the worker can enter Saudi Arabia, transfer employment, or leave the country. The <b>kafala</b> system gives the employer immense control over the worker." [...] HRW stated that [...] "some abusive employers exploit the <b>kafala</b> system and force domestic workers to continue working against their will and forbid them from returning to their countries of origin" [...] {{and that this is}} [...] "incompatible with Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights".|$|E
50|$|As seen above, some states, such as Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE, have {{announced}} {{their commitment to}} amend the legal framework of the <b>kafala</b> system and to extend labor protection to migrant workers. Some of these states have made substantial changes to their labor laws to include migrant workers, other states have not implemented any changes to the <b>kafala</b> system.|$|E

50|$|In the Arab countries, recruiters match {{domestic}} {{workers with}} their employers through the <b>kafala</b> system or sponsorship system. This system binds domestic workers’ visa and legal status {{directly to a}} kafl (or sponsor), who maintains control over her mobility {{for the duration of}} her stay in the host country. Consequently, migrant domestic workers cannot change their place of employment without obtaining prior approval from their employer-sponsor. The <b>kafala</b> system over the years has been credited with the “privatization of regional migration”, creating unequal working conditions and violations of rights of migrant domestic workers.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} concept which regulates migrant {{labor in}} the GCC countries is the <b>kafala</b> system, a sponsorship system which provides the legal basis for both residency and employment of migrant workers in the GCC countries. It relies on a citizen or organization, the kafeel (sponsor) within one of the GCC countries employing migrant workers, {{which is the only}} manner in which the migrant worker can receive an entry visa, residence permit and work permit. Furthermore, under the <b>kafala</b> system, the sponsor takes on both legal and economic responsibility for the migrant worker. This system binds the migrant worker to the employer, as the migrant is allowed only to work for the kafeel and only {{for the duration of the}} contract. The <b>kafala</b> system remains an important part of the laws regulating migrant workers in all of the Gulf states, even though many of these laws have been amended in the Gulf states in the past 15 years.|$|E

The Labour Market Regulatory Law was amended, making the LMRA the official sponsor of migrant workers and, most importantly, allowing migrant workers to leave their employer without the latter’s consent. In December 2016, the Bahraini government announced the official and total abolition of the sponsorship system once more.|$|E
5000|$|According to The Economist, [...] "The migrant workers’ lot is {{unlikely}} to improve until the reform of the <b>kafala</b> system, whereby workers are beholden to the employers who sponsored their visas.
