In January, 1872, a number of {{machinists}} and other [...] working-men organized in the town of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, a [...] Co-operative Foundry Association for the manufacture of stoves, [...] <b>hollow-ware,</b> and fine castings. On a small capital of only $4,000 [...] they have steadily prospered, paid the market rate of wages, and [...] also paid annual dividends, over and above all expenses and [...] interest on the plant, of from twelve to fifteen per cent. In 1867 [...] thirty workmen started a co-operative foundry in Somerset, [...] Massachusetts, with a capital of about $14,000. In the years [...] 1874-1875 the company spent $5,400 for new flasks and patterns, [...] and yet showed a net gain of $11,914.

50|$|The initial {{product of}} copper {{smelting}} was impure black copper, {{which was then}} repeatedly melted to purify it, alternately oxidizing and reducing it.

50|$|Ng took heed of her {{suggestions}} and left Singapore for The Potteries in Stoke-on-Trent in 1962 upon graduating the Academy. He had read pottery design at the North Staffordshire College of Technology / Stoke-on-Trent College of Art between 1962 and 1963, {{and with the}} Farnham School of Art in Surrey, where Ng had spent {{a year as a}} research student of ceramics and sculpture in 1964. He worked with the Carrigaline Pottery in County Cork as a designer of tiles, <b>hollow-ware</b> and tableware after his graduation from Farnham. His commercial designs were exhibited at the Arts and Crafts Centre of Britain and at various Spring Fairs. Ng was beginning {{to make a name for}} himself in the commercial industry, and was even featured in The Irish Press when his designer products became popular with the local market. In 1966, Ng was also awarded with a Diploma by the Society of Industrial Artists and Designers (MSIAD) (now known as the Chartered Society of Designers). But Ng increasingly felt that life in Cork was getting too comfortable, and the work he did was more craft than art. He decided to return home to Singapore to pursue his passion in artistic sculpting.|$|E
50|$|The Birmingham Battery and Metal Co Ltd {{began in}} 1836 in Digbeth {{from where they}} moved to Selly Oak 1871. A {{large part of the}} factory area was turned into a retail {{business}} park in c. 1990 and the works closed in c. 1990 and the buildings were demolished. Only the offices building remained thought by most to be a statutory listed building. There was local shock when this significant landmark building was also demolished. The company was founded by Thomas Gibbins in 1836 and became a limited company in 1897. Joseph Gibbins (1756-1811) was a banker and button maker from South Wales. He was a partner of Matthew Boulton in establishing the Rose Copper Mine. His son, Thomas Gibbins (1796-1863), took over the management of the business. 1n 1884 the very tall chimney was erected and became a local landmark. The Birmingham Battery and Metal Co Ltd used steam engines at Digbeth to work its battery hammers for making <b>hollow-ware.</b> A gas works was built on the site to power the engines driving the five large and several smaller rolling and tube mills, as well as provide lighting. This gas engine was sold in the 1920s, and the steam engines were gradually scrapped from 1908 onwards until by 1926 the factory was all electric. The company also had its own wells and during a drought supplied the canal company with water. The Gibbins family donated the land for Selly Oak Park and Selly Oak Library.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of steel by continuous casting is {{facilitated by the}} use of refractory <b>hollow-ware</b> components. A critical component in this process is the submerged entry nozzle (SEN). The normal operating conditions of the SEN are arduous, involving large temperature gradients and exposure to mechanical forces arising from the flow of molten steel; experimental development of the components is challenging in so hazardous an environment. The effects of the thermal stress conditions in relation to a well-tried design were therefore simulated using a finite element analysis approach. It was concluded from analyses that failures of the type being experienced are caused by the large temperature gradient within the nozzle. The analyses pointed towards a supported shoulder area of the nozzle being most vulnerable to failure and practical in-service experience confirmed this. As a direct consequence of the investigation, design modifications, incorporating changes to both the internal geometry and {{to the nature of the}} intermediate support material, were implemented, thereby substantially reducing the stresses within the Al 2 O 3 /graphite ceramic liner. Industrial trials of this modified design established that the component reliability would be significantly improved and the design has now been implemented in series production...|$|E
40|$|Results of a {{study of}} the {{production}} of <b>hollow-ware</b> by deep-drawing and bulge forming are presented. Axisyrnrnetrical and asymmetrical shapes were successfully produced from soft aluminium flat blanks in one stroke of a punch. The process consists of drawing, ironing and bulging inside a closed die cavity. The constituent operations are studied individually. In deep drawing without a blank-holder, an approach to convex type die design is presented. The investigation evaluates the effect of die profile geometry on the drawing performance. Three dies of the second degree spiral type,one near to the tractrix shape and the other two with larger radius of curvature, are considered. The materials tested include mild steel, stainless steel, soft aluminium and brass. The drawing process through tractrix, exponential spiral, second degree spiral and conical type dies is analysed using a numerical solution formulated earlier and the theoretical results on the punch load and the strain development are compared with the experimental results. Good correlation is obtained on the development of strains. The theoretical prediction of the punch load is reasonably good except for mild steel which is highly anisotropic. It is shown that by modifying the die profile, the 'punch load can be significantly reduced. The reductions predicted by theory are in good agreement with experiment which means that optimum die design for minimum load is possible. In ironing of cups, using soft aluminium blanks, it was found that punch speeds in the range 7 - 45 rom/sec have negligible effect on the drawing load. The ironing load decreases slightly as the speed increases in this range. The reduction is more significant with higher degrees of ironing. Measurement of ironed cup wall thickness showed that thickness variations are attributed to planar anisotropy of the blank and geometrical errors in tooling. Free bulge forming is used as a simplified approach to closed die forming. The bulge profile modes under different loading conditions of internal pressure and axial force, the effect of the unsupported cup length and the effect of the cup wall thickness on the bulge ratio were investigated using a specially designed test rig. For bulging of as deep-drawn cups, the bulge ratio increases with increase of cup wall thickness, and it decreases with increase of length. For bulging of annealed cups the length effect is negligible and the bulge ratio increases slightly with increase of cup wall thickness. The procedure used in producing different <b>hollow-ware.</b> shapes is described together with typical failure examples. The thickness reduction and bulge ratio distributions are shown and comparison is made between annealed and as deep-drawn cups...|$|E
