Hardware software complex <b>of</b> <b>curds</b> taste control is proposed to apply in industry for independent estimate of final product. Operation of neural network model based on usage of artificial neural networks, {{which is one of}} directions of artificial intelligence theory. Neural network model consists of several artificial neurons layers, which emulate nerve cells functioning.

The experiments were performed with heat-treated milk at 87 ºC for 10 minutes to induce chemical interaction between casein and serum proteins and to form the co-called co aggregates. The curd particles were dried at 42 ºC and 45 ºC for 60 minutes and two types <b>of</b> <b>curd,</b> named curd A and curd B were formed afterwards. The results of the experiments showed that the used temperatures had no significant influence on chemical composition <b>of</b> the <b>curd.</b> The average total solids <b>of</b> <b>curd</b> A was 49. 09 %, moisture in fat free basis (MFFB) 68. 78 % protein content 22. 23 %, lactose content 1. 55 %, ash 1. 98 %, titratable acidity 71. 700 T and pH 6. 22.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to predict the effect of {{technological}} parameters on the physical processes of cheesemaking. To this end we developed and modified techniques with which to measure the physical properties <b>of</b> the <b>curd,</b> such as its permeability and its rheological properties. The effects of different factors, such as pH, temperature, the concentration of casein, the geometry <b>of</b> the <b>curd,</b> applied compressive stress and of the deformation on the physical properties <b>of</b> the <b>curd</b> were studied. Further modifications {{and development of the}} method to measure the syneresis <b>of</b> <b>curd</b> grains by estimating the progressive dilution of added tracer were made. The grain size was the most important factor determining the shrinkage <b>of</b> the <b>curd</b> grain in the initial stage of syneresis, whereas the pH was the dominating factor in the later stage. A laser distance meter was used to follow continuously the course of one-dimensional syneresis of rennet-induced skim milk gels. The method made it to follow the initial stage of the syneresis within 10 s after the surface <b>of</b> the <b>curd</b> slab was moistened and the initial syneresis rate was found to be dependent on the thickness <b>of</b> <b>curd</b> slabs in the range of 3 - 35 mm. Further development of the method for measuring the fusion <b>of</b> <b>curd</b> grains, using two plan-parallel surfaces of known area, that were exposed to fusion, and a means of controlling directly the fusion pressure, was undertaken. In this way the total deformation occurring during fusion could be followed, which had not been possible using earlier methods. A novel finding was that there was an optimum amount of syneresis prior to fusion, which led to the fastest fusion. Total fusion could be achieved in a fusion time of 20 - 25 min. We followed the compression behavior with different sample sizes over wide ranges of compression velocities. A key experimental finding was that the force increased almost linearly with the deformation at constant deformation rate, a finding which implied that curd permeability did not control the curd compression behavior. We have for the first time developed a method to determine, at least approximately, the fracture properties <b>of</b> cheese <b>curd</b> with no syneresis. The experiments showed that the time course of the behavior in tension did not replicate the behavior in shear or compression...|$|R

40|$|A Buffalo curd {{packed in}} a clay pot {{is one of}} the most {{traditional}} dairy products in Sri Lanka. Although both clay pots and plastic cups are used for packaging <b>of</b> <b>curd,</b> the clay pot is the most popular package. However, the clay pot is disposable and become a waste after a use. This unsustainable consumption of limited clay resource is not environment friendly and cost effective. Re-using clay pots after re-firing will protect the earth while enhancing profit to the curd producer. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of re-firing <b>of</b> used <b>curd</b> packing clay pots on physical & microbiological qualities, quality <b>of</b> <b>curd</b> and analyze the possible energy saving. A Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used for the experiment with four treatments and eight replicates. The treatments are; Re-firing of used pots only once, twice, thrice and the control (new pots). Pots were re-fired at 800 0 C for one hour using a muffle furnace. Then the physical properties: weight, colour and compressive strength were measured. The initial microbial loads were tested by plate counts. Mold growth on curd was visually observed and pH was also measured to evaluate the shelf life <b>of</b> <b>curd.</b> According to the results, re-firing improved the red colour while reducing initial microbial counts. There was no effect on compressive strength and pot weight. The porosity of pots increased with re-firing. This led to excessive water loss resulting pH reduction <b>of</b> <b>curd</b> after third firing. Mold growth on curd was not observed for 12 days.

Changes in developmental rates, which shorten or prolong the growing time may aggravate or reduce the effects of sub-optimal conditions on yield. Therefore, the effect of defoliation on development of cauliflower was investigated in a number of field experiments. Reduction in curd growth due to defoliation during the curd growth phase was compensated by an increased duration <b>of</b> <b>curd</b> growth.

Measurement of maturity by means <b>of</b> <b>curd</b> specific weight showed that defoliation delayed maturity.
