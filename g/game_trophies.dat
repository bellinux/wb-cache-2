25|$|Old Ebbitt Grill reopened at 675 15th Street NW {{in early}} October 1983. Clyde's Restaurant Group spent $4.4 million {{constructing}} and outfitting the interior. The architectural firm of Andrews & Chatelain designed the interior. The interior decoration {{was designed to}} mimic the bar at 1427 F Street, and included the <b>game</b> <b>trophies</b> (some of which were originals, not recreations, and rumored to have been shot by President Theodore Roosevelt). Old Ebbitt's famous mahogany bar was not installed in the new location, however. A replica was crafted instead. The walls were paneled in mahogany and the ceilings decorated with murals and stencils. The restaurant had seating for 200 at tables and in booths. The booths had green leather seats and velvet-covered walls, and were separated from one another by etched glass dividers. The long bar still sported mounted game animal trophies overhead, the fixtures were of marble or brass, and the curtains of lace. An oyster bar {{was added to the}} rear of the restaurant on the main floor. The kitchen featured a special charcoal-burning grill, and the wine cellar featured a Cruvinet wine dispensing system. Gas lamps were used in the main bar and booth area. A year after the Grill opened, the Washington Post said it had the best dining ambience of any restaurant in the city.|$|E
2500|$|Old Ebbitt Grill {{has four}} bars: [...] the Old Bar (which {{is part of}} the Main Dining Room, and {{features}} the mounted <b>game</b> <b>trophies),</b> the Oyster Bar (to the right of the entry foyer), Grant's Bar (toward the rear of the restaurant, adjacent to the Atrium Dining Room), and the Corner Bar (up the short steps and {{to the left of the}} entry foyer, along G Street NW). The etched glass panels separating the Old Bar from the Main Dining Room were created by Charles Shefts. Grant's Bar, named for American Civil War General Ulysses S. Grant, features a ceiling mural by Carol Loeb. An oil painting by Peter Egeli replicates one of Mathew Brady's famous Civil War photographs of Grant.|$|E
2500|$|The new Old Ebbitt Grill {{improved}} its menu. It reopened at {{the same}} location on October 13, 1970. The mahogany bar was slightly lowered, new HVAC installed, and a general $130,000 refurbishment completed. Clyde's and Old Ebbitt Grill shared the same menus, which lowered costs and led to improved training for kitchen staff. In June 1974, a Washington Post food review declared Old Ebbitt's fare to be [...] "American, plain, and not bad". By 1977, Washington Post food critic Donald Dresden was praising the restaurants bacon cheeseburgers and innovative menu items: [...] "Imitators {{are still trying to}} top Clyde's and the Ebbitt's bacon cheeseburgers and the disc-shaped deep-fried potatoes that come with—but they'll have to keep trying still." [...] The new owners retained Old Ebbitt's dark paneling, shelves of beer steins, mounted <b>game</b> <b>trophies,</b> and spittoons, which it had long showcased. The decor was made more whimsical, however, leading Washington Post architectural critic Wolf Von Eckardt to declare in 1978 that the Grill was [...] "one of the most charming rendezvous on the Eastern Seaboard". The restaurant featured bare, unpolished wood flooring throughout, with a fern bar on the second floor. Washington Post reporter Pamela Kessler said in 1981, [...] "The restaurant feels like old Philadelphia, rather than a slicker, parvenu Washington".|$|E

50|$|Following the 1961 <b>game,</b> the <b>trophy</b> {{was stolen}} several more times and was {{eventually}} forgotten as the football <b>game's</b> <b>trophy.</b> In 1986, artist Spady, now an art teacher in Eugene, spotted the trophy {{in a case}} at Oregon's Leighton Pool.

50|$|Historically, tigers {{have been}} hunted on foot, horseback, elephant-back, and from machans. Any of these {{involved}} considerable danger and the hunting of a tiger {{had been considered}} a manly and a courageous feat with <b>game,</b> <b>trophies</b> being collected as the symbols of valor and prestige. Accounts of British royalty photographed aside dead tiger carcasses during the late 19th and early 20th centuries depict {{the construction of the}} successful conquest of Indian nature, thus symbolizing the imperial, masculine identities desired by the British. In some places such as China, tigers were also perceived to be a threat to human life in the area, so those who managed to kill them were hailed as heroes to the general public.|$|E
