40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of this project was to design and build an autonomous underwater platform that could reach a depth of 20 m. It would be programmed with a trajectory, including horizontal and vertical motion, initially positioned using GPS. Inertial navigation {{would be used for}} part of the way, with recalibration of the position available via GPS if the unit surfaced. The platform would have a camera and the video signal would be compressed and recorded, along with navigational data, on the internal HDD. The platform would also be designed to carry instrumentation if required. The ROV is designed to use four motors for horizontal positioning. Once the ROV arrives at the location to be reached, then it can navigate itself to a point underwater at a pre-established depth by using a depth sensor, and the on-board microprocessor can control the depth of the ROV. Finally by using position detection system such as GPS, the ROV can allocate to the given point directly and positioning at a <b>fixed</b> <b>point</b> for <b>instrumentation</b> or other jobs...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{temperature}} dependence of {{various aspects of}} light-emitting diode (LED) performance, LED temperature sensing is becoming increasingly important in solid-state lighting applications. This thesis presents an electrical technique for junction-temperature sensing based on the measurement of the forward voltage and current of an LED at two bias points. This technique is inspired by techniques commonly used in temperature sensors based on bipolar transistors. While it leads to higher temperature errors than existing electrical techniques, which use the linear relationship between voltage and temperature at a fixed current, the proposed technique {{has the potential to}} significantly reduce calibration costs, as it requires calibration at only one temperature instead of two for existing techniques. Measurements of commercial high-power LEDs show that temperature errors can be reduced by using differential measurements around a <b>fixed</b> voltage-bias <b>point</b> instead of the more commonly used <b>fixed</b> current-bias <b>point.</b> Electronic <b>Instrumentation</b> LaboratoryMicroelectronics & Computer EngineeringElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
