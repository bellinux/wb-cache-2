50|$|Flare {{connections}} {{require that}} the end of a tubing section be spread outward in a bell shape using a flare tool. A <b>flare</b> <b>nut</b> then compresses this bell-shaped end onto a male fitting. Flare connections are a labor-intensive method of making connections, but are quite reliable over the course of many years.|$|E
50|$|Flared {{connectors}} {{should not}} be confused with compression connectors, with which they are generally not interchangeable. Lacking a compression ring, they use a tapered conical shaped connection instead. A specialized flaring tool is used to enlarge tubing into a 45ยบ tapered bell shape matching the projecting shape of the flare fitting. The <b>flare</b> <b>nut,</b> which had previously been installed over the tubing, is then tightened over the fitting to force the tapered surfaces tightly together. Flare connectors are typically made of brass or plastic, but stainless steel or other materials may be used.|$|E
5000|$|Flare {{fittings}} are {{a type of}} {{compression fitting}} used with metal tubing, usually soft steel, ductile (soft) copper and aluminum, though other materials are also used. Tube flaring {{is considered to be}} a type of forging operation, and is usually a cold working procedure. During assembly, a <b>flare</b> <b>nut</b> is used to secure the flared tubing's tapered end to the also tapered fitting, producing a pressure-resistant, leak-tight seal. Flared connections offer a high degree of long-term reliability and for this reason are often used in mission-critical and inaccessible locations.|$|E
50|$|Rigid {{sections}} of liquid line are usually made using copper tubing, although in some applications, steel pipes are used instead. The {{ends of the}} pipes are always double-flared and fitted with <b>flare</b> <b>nuts</b> to secure them to the fittings.|$|R
50|$|JIC fittings, {{defined by}} the SAE J514 and MIL-F-18866 standards, are a type of flare fitting {{machined}} with a 37-degree flare seating surface. JIC (Joint Industry Council) fittings are widely used in fuel delivery and fluid power applications, especially where high pressure (up to 10,000 psi) is involved. The SAE J514 standard replaces the MS16142 military specification, although some tooling is still listed under MS16142. JIC fittings are dimensionally identical to AN (Army-Navy) fittings, but are produced to less exacting tolerances and are generally less costly. SAE 45-degree flare fittings are similar in appearance, but are not interchangeable, though dash sizes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 14, and 16 share the same thread size. Some couplings may have dual machined seats for both 37-degree and 45-degree flare seats.Komatsu and JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) fittings have flare ends similar to JIC fittings. Komatsu and JIS both use a 30-degree flare seating surface. The only difference is Komatsu uses milimeter thread sizes while JIS use a BSP (British Standard Pipe) thread. JIC fitting systems have three components that make a tubing assembly: fitting, <b>flare</b> <b>nut,</b> and sleeve. As with other flared connection systems, the seal is achieved through metal-to-metal contact between the finished surface of the fitting nose and the inside diameter of the flared tubing. The sleeve is used to evenly distribute the compressive forces of the <b>flare</b> <b>nut</b> to the flared end of the tube. Materials commonly used to fabricate JIC fittings include forged carbon steel, forged stainless steel, forged brass, machined brass, Monel and nickel-copper alloys.|$|E
