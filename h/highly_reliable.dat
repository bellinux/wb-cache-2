5|$|Finnhorses {{are popular}} as {{recreational}} riding horses, and well-suited for use at riding schools, trekking, and riding therapy. Of the ten horses currently {{employed by the}} mounted police of Helsinki, two are Finnhorses, though they are considered a bit small for the job. They are also competitive in many disciplines, and in the 1970s separate competition classes for Finnhorses were established at horse shows, which also helped to increase {{the popularity of the}} breed. While in eventing and horse racing, Finnhorses are too slow to compete directly against Thoroughbreds and the sport horse breeds, they are a <b>highly</b> <b>reliable</b> mount for cross-country riding, particularly over difficult terrain; during the Continuation War, the breed successfully crossed any wetland with which it was confronted. In endurance riding. Uusi-Helinä, ridden by Ritva Lampinen, successfully finished the endurance riding world championship competition in Stockholm, Sweden in 1990, finishing 28th.|$|E
5|$|The Gospels {{say that}} Jesus was betrayed to the {{authorities}} by a disciple, and many scholars consider this report to be <b>highly</b> <b>reliable.</b> He was executed on the orders of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Judaea. Pilate most likely saw Jesus' reference to the Kingdom of God {{as a threat to}} Roman authority and worked with the Temple elites to have Jesus executed. The Sadducean high-priestly leaders of the Temple more plausibly had Jesus executed for political reasons than for his teaching. They may have regarded him as a threat to stability, especially after he caused a disturbance at the Second Temple. Other factors, such as Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, may have contributed to this decision. Most scholars consider Jesus' crucifixion to be factual, because early Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader.|$|E

25|$|In {{comparison}} to the standard production Re.2000s, the newer Re.2000GA variant was heavier and significantly slower, possessing an empty weight of 2,190kg compared to the Re.2000's 2,080kg along with a maximum speed of 520km/h at 5,300 meters. The armament {{was a pair of}} 12.7mm SAFAT machineguns, complete with 600 rounds, along with provisions for a Nardi dispenser capable of housing 88 2kg bomblets (this was a typical 'special armament' for the Re.2000). The Re.2000GA was never considered to be <b>highly</b> <b>reliable,</b> even by Re.2000 standards, especially due to its troublesome engine.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} carried artillery system in most indigenous ships is the 37mm anti-aircraft artillery (Type-61/76). This is a manually operated gun, {{with a gun}} crew on an open mount. The Type 61 is carried by most Chinese surface combatants, ranging from the small Shanghai and Hainan coastal combat vessels to the largest combatants of the Luda and Jianghu class. These guns are highly limited—they can be operated only in clear weather conditions and are effective only in daylight conditions since they lack radar coordination or any form of automatic or autonomous targeting. They are, however, economical and <b>highly</b> <b>reliable.</b> Their firepower has been effectively utilized not only against aircraft but also against surface and land targets.|$|E

30|$|In summary, we have {{described}} {{a novel approach}} to chemical sensors based on aligned ZnO NRAs grown on Pt-coated Si substrates with a top–top electrode configuration. The O 2 and NO 2 sensing properties of the fabricated sensor showed both a high sensitivity and an excellent reproducibility during the repeated test cycles.

25|$|Independent twin {{cylinders}}, (Two cylinders {{of about}} the same capacity mounted together {{on the back of}} the diver, each with its own regulator) are unquestionably a redundant gas supply configuration, as there is no possibility of flow from one to the other during the dive. Use of independent twins for bailout requires the diver to ensure that at all times during the dive both cylinders have sufficient gas remaining to ensure a safe ascent, including any decompression that may be required. This requirement is based on the possibility that either of the cylinders may become unusable without warning. This requirement means that the cylinders are usually breathed in turn, and changed before the pressure drops to the critical pressure for that stage of the dive. This system is economical on gas, and <b>highly</b> <b>reliable</b> when done correctly, but relatively heavy on task loading.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Austria {{introduced}} the 5.56×45mm Steyr AUG bullpup rifle, {{often cited as}} the first successful bullpup rifle, finding service with {{the armed forces of}} over twenty countries. It was highly advanced for the 1970s, combining in the same weapon the bullpup configuration, a polymer housing, dual vertical grips, an optical sight as standard, and a modular design. <b>Highly</b> <b>reliable,</b> light, and accurate, the Steyr AUG showed clearly the potential of the bullpup layout. In 1978, France {{introduced the}} 5.56×45mm FAMAS bullpup rifle. In 1985, the British introduced the 5.56×45mm L85 bullpup rifle. In the late 1990s, Israel introduced the 5.56mm NATO Tavor TAR-21. In 1997, China's People's Liberation Army's adopted QBZ-95 in the new 5.8×42mm cartridge, which they claim is superior to the both 5.56×45mm and the 5.45×39mm. By the turn of the century, the bullpup assault rifle design had achieved worldwide acceptance.|$|E
25|$|In the South galleys {{continued}} to be useful for trade even as sailing vessels evolved more efficient hulls and rigging; since they could hug the shoreline and make steady progress when winds failed, they were <b>highly</b> <b>reliable.</b> The zenith {{in the design of}} merchant galleys came with the state-owned great galleys of the Venetian Republic, first built in the 1290s. These were used to carry the lucrative trade in luxuries from the east such as spices, silks and gems. They were in all respects larger than contemporary war galleys (up to 46m) and had a deeper draft, with more room for cargo (140-250 t). With a full complement of rowers ranging from 150 to 180 men, all available to defend the ship from attack, they were also very safe modes of travel. This attracted a business of carrying affluent pilgrims to the Holy Land, a trip that could be accomplished in as little 29 days on the route Venice-Jaffa, despite landfalls for rest and watering or for respite from rough weather.|$|E

25|$|While {{evidence}} such as {{size and}} scale of site and of individual structures (e.g., El Tigre at El Mirador) is compelling, {{developments in the}} Southern area remain resilient against conclusive consensus. The temporal priority of plentiful as opposed to scant evidence of stelae and writing in the Preclassic south compared to the Mirador Basin must be based principally on absolute dating, although this problem, itself, becomes difficult to resolve when events are dated by 14C (“calibrated” or “uncalibrated”) – still {{the most widely used}} absolute dating method in Mesoamerica – and which cannot be rendered more fine-grained than ca. 100 years and often is less precise. Accordingly, the debate about temporal priority will remain unresolved unless and until other absolute dating methods such as archaeomagnetics and luminescence (hitherto, thermoluminescence), are applied more widely, or Long Count-dated texts, e.g., Cycle 6, are found earlier than those found thus far, which are Cycle 7. While relative dating methods – principally ceramic – are <b>highly</b> <b>reliable,</b> having been cross-referenced from many sites, and with sophisticated statistics available, unless anchored to absolute dates, these remain uncertain especially when the scholar’s focus is on the early periods of development in Mesoamerica.|$|E
500|$|One {{important}} use of American kestrels is in falconry. It {{is often}} considered a beginner's bird, though the careful weight control {{needed to maintain}} the kestrel's desire to aggressively hunt takes skill. Falconers experienced in extracting the best performance the species is capable of report they are <b>highly</b> <b>reliable</b> on the normal game of sparrows and starlings. More aggressive individuals are sometimes capable of capturing prey up to approximately twice their own body weight, allowing the occasional capture of true game birds such as quail and dove. However, most falconers interested in the reliable taking of such game do prefer larger falcons or hawks. The advantage the American kestrel offers the experienced falconer is its suitability to simple and urban falconry not requiring large tracts of land {{or the use of}} hunting dogs. This form of falconry is sometimes referred to as [...] "micro-falconry" [...] or [...] "micro-hawking." [...] The other small raptor species commonly used in micro-falconry are the Merlin, the Sharp-shinned hawk (the smallest accipiter), and the European kestrel (a true kestrel).|$|E
500|$|For a {{traditionally}} trained navigator, these inputs include physical {{signals from the}} sea, skies, and stars, memory signals from his knowledge of star, swell, and wind compasses; and cultural knowledge recorded in chants, dances, and stories. Examples of physical signals include the color, temperature, and taste (salinity) of seawater; floating plant debris; sightings of land-based seabirds flying out to fish; cloud type, color, and movement; wind direction, speed, and temperature; the direction and nature of ocean swells and waves; the position of stars in the sky, and his estimation of the speed, current set, and leeway of his sailing craft. The [...] "compass" [...] he carried was not magnetic but a mental model of where islands are located and the star points that one could use to navigate between them. This mental model would have taken years of study to build; dances, chants (rong), and stories help him to recall complex relationships of geography and location. The stars give him <b>highly</b> <b>reliable</b> position information when visible, but navigators such as Mau managed to keep their position and tracks in mind even when blocked by clouds, using other references such as wind and swell as proxies.|$|E
