What is to be prevented is the seizure of these heights for the purpose of establishing batteries to destroy the navy-yard and arsenal. For this purpose the works should be self-sustaining, or relying only upon such aid as a small movable body of troops can furnish, and upon succor, which may be thrown over the Branch after an attack is developed.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{combine to}} create the dump months, most of them {{circumstances}} particular to the United States and Canada, the primary market for most major Hollywood releases. Both periods immediately follow the times of {{year in which the}} distributors concentrate films they <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the biggest critical and/or commercial successes, periods of increased spending on entertainment generally. While this often means that moviegoers have less disposable income afterwards, economics alone does not explain the dump months. The weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump months are further affected by the Academy Awards eligibility rules.|$|E
5|$|The German Geheime Staatspolizei ("Secret state police"), {{known as}} the Gestapo, was {{responsible}} for targeting resistance groups in Belgium. Resistance fighters who were captured could <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interrogated, tortured and either summarily executed or sent to a concentration camp. The Gestapo was effective at using informants within groups to betray whole local resistance network and in examining resistance publications for clues about its place of production. 2,000 resistance members involved in underground press alone were arrested during the war. In total, 30,000 members of the resistance were captured during the war, of whom 16,000 were executed or died in captivity.|$|E

5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term {{that everyone in the}} community would <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used. According to contrast, infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain contrast in their own word use.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Lightning placed 34th in a Famitsu poll {{regarding}} {{the most popular}} video game character in Japan. She was voted the best-liked female Final Fantasy character in a 2013 poll by Square Enix, and, in that year's Dengeki PlayStation Awards, she was voted best video game character {{of the year for}} her appearance in Lightning Returns. She came first in a Microsoft poll to determine the most popular character of the Final Fantasy XIII games. In 2014, readers of IGN voted her the best character in XIII. At PAX Prime 2013, she took third place in a list, compiled by journalists and game developers, of the top female characters in western and Japanese role-playing video games. In a Famitsu poll from 2017, Lightning was voted as the second most wanted character fans <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> featured in another Square Enix's franchise, Kingdom Hearts, being surpassed only by Noctis Lucis Caelum from Final Fantasy XV.|$|E
5|$|The deaths {{caused by}} World War I were {{difficult}} for post-war societies to cope with: their unprecedented scale challenged existing methods of grieving. Furthermore, an expectation had arisen {{during the war}} that individual soldiers would <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> commemorated, {{even if they were}} low ranking members of the military. One method used to address this was the inclusion of lists of names. In part, this was a response to the practical problem of commemorating such large numbers of dead, but it carried additional symbolic importance; in some ways, the physical presence of a name acted to compensate for an absent body. The lists could vary in size from the 21 names listed in a small English village like East Ilsley, to the 54,896 names inscribed on the Menin Gate and the 73,357 on the Thiepval Memorial.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} African Americans in the {{territory}} during this period was quite small but not insignificant. Newcomers continued to bring slaves with them, but there were many free blacks as well, some working as servants and some as completely independent pioneers. Information about the black immigrants during the earlier periods is sparse, but records do show {{that most of those}} at Fort Snelling were slaves. Records from 1850 indicate a population of 39 free blacks out of a total population of 6,077 citizens {{in the territory}} (which excluded Native American tribes). Before the 1840s these free persons could often <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated equal to other racial groups. By the time Minnesota had achieved statehood, however, blacks had been disenfranchised and schools were segregated. Despite this, {{from the start of the}} Minnesota Territory in 1848 the leadership was predominantly antislavery thus ending the practice in this era.|$|E
5|$|The scale, and {{associated}} {{high number of}} casualties, of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead. Previous to World War I, individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers. However, the war required mobilisation of {{a significant percentage of}} the population, either as volunteers or through conscription. An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> commemorated, even if they were low-ranking members of the military. A committee under Frederic Kenyon, Director of the British Museum, presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the cemeteries. Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions. Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses, it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of brotherhood that had developed between serving ranks.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{found so}} many bodies that the {{embalming}} supplies aboard were quickly exhausted. Health regulations permitted that only embalmed bodies could {{be returned to}} port. Captain Larnder of the Mackay-Bennett and the undertakers aboard decided to preserve all bodies of First Class passengers {{because of the need}} to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates. As a result, the majority of the burials at sea were third class passengers and crew. Larnder himself claimed that as a mariner, he would <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> buried at sea. However complaints about the burials at sea were made by families and undertakers. Later ships such as Minia found fewer bodies, requiring fewer embalming supplies, and were able to limit burials at sea to bodies which were too damaged to preserve.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{learning}} of the strong Mexican resistance to his proposed modifications, Webster instructed Letcher to negotiate the most favorable terms to which the Mexicans would agree. On January 25, 1851, Letcher signed a second treaty that was slightly more favorable to the Americans. During the time it had taken both sides to negotiate the treaty, however, public sentiment in Mexico had turned decidedly against any form of treaty with the United States regarding Tehuantepec. On May 22, 1851, the Mexican government declared the agreement with the American investors null on grounds that the provisional government which granted {{it did not have}} the right to do so. Letcher attempted to negotiate a new treaty to re-acquire the rights nullified by the Mexican government, but by February 14, 1852, he reported that he did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to reach any kind of agreement. He returned home in August 1852.|$|E
5|$|Rhonda Latimer, {{an aging}} {{reporter}} for Fox News Channel who is idolized by viewers {{because of her}} good looks, is dismissed when the network's first high-definition broadcast exposes her wrinkles, leaving a job opportunity open. Lois auditions for the part, ignoring Brian's warnings that Fox News is a heavily biased network, and she is chosen as the new reporter. On her first day reporting, she is assigned to do an exposé on Michael Moore {{to prove that he}} is a homosexual. When she spies on him outside his house, she sees Rush Limbaugh coming out, leading her to conclude that Limbaugh and Moore are in a gay relationship. However, Fox News refuses to allow any material against fellow conservative Limbaugh to be broadcast, leading Lois to realize that Brian was right about them. The two decide to take the story into their own hands and confront who they <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Moore and a naked Limbaugh in the same bedroom, only to discover that the both of them are portrayed by Fred Savage, who has created bodysuits of them in order to continue his acting career. A flabbergasted Lois ultimately decides to report his story instead.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days later}} he {{received}} permission for another daylight sortie. Squadron Leader Robertson joined him on this occasion as his flight engineer. He flew to Lasham {{to pick up a}} Mosquito. His target on this occasion would be Denmark. The Luftwaffe kept a number of operational units in the region so he flew to Coltishall in Norfolk to be nearer his destination and conserve fuel during the sortie. Near Aalborg he sighted two aircraft. So far away from the battle zones, the Germans did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attacked by the enemy. Neither made much attempt to defend themselves. The first, a Junkers W 34 transport, was shot down and the second, a Junkers Ju 52, tried a crash-landing only to nose-over and crumple the wings. Braham strafed it to ensure destruction. His gun cameras filmed the action during which he fired 320 rounds. On 4 April he returned to France. Lacking radar, Braham sought out large airfields to be sure of intercepting an enemy aircraft. He flew to Bordeaux looking for He 177s that intelligence suggested were operating against Atlantic convoys from Bordeaux–Mérignac. Braham only encountered a Bücker Bü 131 which fell victim after a brief burst of fire.|$|E

5|$|To prevent South Korea's {{collapse}} the United Nations Security Council {{voted to}} send military forces. The United States' Seventh Fleet dispatched Task Force 77, {{led by the}} fleet carrier , and the British Far East Fleet dispatched several ships, including , to provide air and naval support. Although the navies blockaded North Korea and launched aircraft to delay the North Korean forces these efforts alone did not stop the North Korean Army juggernaut on its southern advance. U.S. President Harry S. Truman later ordered ground troops into the country to supplement the air support. All U.S. Navy units and ships including Leyte were placed on alert. The ship was in the Mediterranean Sea, and Hudner did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deployed to Korea, but on 8 August a relief carrier arrived {{in the area and}} Leyte was ordered to Korea. Naval commanders felt the pilots on Leyte were better trained and prepared than those of other available carriers, and so they were among the first dispatched to the theater. Leyte sailed from the Strait of Gibraltar across the Atlantic Ocean and to Quonset, then through the Panama Canal and San Diego, California, Hawaii, and Japan before arriving in the waters off Korea around 8 October.|$|E
5|$|In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief {{engineer}} Nolan Bushnell, {{designer of the}} first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, saw {{a demonstration of the}} Odyssey at a dealership. Inspired, when he quit Nutting to start his own company, Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game. Alcorn soon developed Pong, which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer once noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors including Nutting, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and Williams Electronics for infringing on Baer's patents for video games played on a television screen. Baer has stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits. The root of the conflict was a pair of patents by Baer—one which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, and an earlier one that went into detail about how the Odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one bounce off, specifically using a game of ping pong as an example.|$|E
