40|$|The Lower Jurassic Sub-system {{comprises}} four stages, in chronological order, the Hettangian, Sinemurian, Pliensbachian and Toarcian. Each {{stage is}} subdivided into {{a sequence of}} `standard zones' (= chronozones) and subzones - each correlated primarily {{on the basis of}} its ammonite fauna. A further increase in stratigraphical resolution is available by the use of intra-subzonal units known collectively as `horizons'. The close link between ammonites and chronostratigraphy means that faunal provincialism may determine which zonal framework, and therefore which subdivision of the Lower Jurassic, applies in different regions of Europe. Such provincialism is of minor importance in the early Jurassic (Hettangian - Lower Pliensbachian) but increases significantly in the Upper Pliensbachian and into the Toarcian where at least three ammonoid faunal provinces are distinguishable. The standard zonal schemes for each relevant <b>faunal</b> <b>area</b> are discussed here, with greatest emphasis being placed on the Northwest European Province, which is characteristic of much of northern Europe throughout most of the Early Jurassic. Intra-subzonal units have only been described in certain regions for parts of the Lower Jurassic but where recognisable these are introduced...|$|E
40|$|The {{divisive}} {{information analysis}} {{was used for the}} hierarchical classifications of <b>faunal</b> <b>areas</b> and <b>faunal</b> elements of Australia from the distribution of 464 species of land birds at 121 selected sites. The <b>faunal</b> <b>areas</b> are delimited from the classification of the sites in terms of the distributions of species, superspecies, genera, and polytypic genera, separately. For the classification of faunal elements only species groups and genera groups were used.

This demonstrates empirically the applicability of the numerical method to zoogeography. Comparison between the species pattern and the genera pattern of distribution suggests the Kimberley line as the oldest barrier separating the central fauna from the northern fauna. This is followed by the barriers separating the faunas of Tasmania, the south-west, and the north-east respectively, in order of increasing recency.

40|$|Samples {{from the}} Neogene and Recent of Sabah, Malaysia, have yielded 43 cladocopine, platycopine and podocopine {{ostracod}} genera which are recorded and variously described. The genera Polycope. Cytherelloidea and Atjehella {{are described in}} detail and contain a total of 27 new species. Polycope is recorded from {{this part of the}} world for the first time. Newly discovered morphological structures suggest that shell ornament may be a valuable aid (to soft parts) in the taxonomy of the genus. The functional significance of many ornamental features of the shell is probably as strengthening devices. Morphology of the marginal pore canals is particularly useful in distinguishing the originally monotypic Atjehella. The existing view, based on foraminifera (Whittaker Hodgkinson, 1979), that the Pliocene Togopi Formation of Sabah was deposited in shallow marine conditions (inner shelf to littoral) is substantiated by its ostracod fauna. At specific level the ostracod assemblages of the Pliocene Togopi Formation and Recent of Darvel Bay, Sabah are new; a comparison of the ostracod fauna of Sabah to known ostracod faunas from the Indian Ocean and adjacent areas (e. g.

40|$|Intensive {{sampling}} of the Tulong Formation in South Tibet has facilitated {{the construction of a}} highly-resolved middle and late Smithian ammonoid succession. The new biostratigraphical sequence comprises the middle Smithian Brayardites compressus beds, Nammalites pilatoides beds, and the Nyalamites angustecostatus beds followed by the late Smithian Wasatchites distractus beds and Glyptophiceras sinuatum beds. This faunal succession correlates very well with that of other Tethyan sequences such as the Salt Range (Pakistan), Spiti (India), Oman and South China.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The marine {{reservoir}} {{effect is}} known to skew radiocarbon dating (marine samples appear “older ” than terrestrial samples of equivalent age), but {{the magnitude of this}} effect is not the same in all locations. Carbon- 14 age determinations from 23 paired samples of terrestrial and marine origin are presented for five areas around the northern and eastern Bering Sea. It appears statistically suitable to average the age differences for three pairs, weighted inversely by variance. Differences from within each of 14 pairs of wood charcoal vs. sea mammal residue (from St. Lawrence Island, Cape Prince of Wales, Nunivak Island, Alaska Peninsula, and Unalaska Island) yield a weighted mean of 737 ± 20 years. Somewhat more variant differences from within each of five additional pairs of wood charcoal vs. sea mammal residue (St. Lawrence Island, Unalaska Island) provide a lower weighted mean of 460 ± 41 years. Differences from within each of four pairs of wood charcoal vs. marine shell (Nunivak Island) produce a weighted mean of 459 ± 32 years. Variations in these apparent reservoir effects presumably result largely from the interplay of differential ocean water upwelling and customary <b>faunal</b> feeding <b>areas,</b> although possible effects of other species characteristics cannot be ruled out. Dating of marine samples from the Bering Sea should thus either proceed with the expectation that age determinations may not be accurate within several centuries, or be approached through experimental measurement of reservoir effect among restricted faunal species in limited areas. Overall, the effect throughout the eastern Bering Sea appears to range from about 450 to 750 years...|$|R
40|$|The Sanderson site (DhMs- 12) is a Mortlach phase <b>faunal</b> {{processing}} <b>area</b> {{located on}} the Souris River in southeastern Saskatchewan. The site is composed of two occupation levels separated by a sterile layer. The upper level of the site is dated to approximately 250 years ago. The site is located within a riverine ecotone, similar in location to other Mortlach sites from Saskatchewan, North Dakota, and Montana. Excavations were {{carried out by the}} Saskatchewan Research Council in order to salvage the site as part of the Rafferty Hydroelectric Dam mitigation project. The excavation area labeled as Block seven west was used as a sample for the faunal analysis of the site and yielded material with excellent preservation but high levels of fragmentation. There were a number of different animal species represented at the site although bison were predominant. A detailed faunal analysis was undertaken to determine the composition of the bison herd and canid species identification.

An actualistic study was designed to determine the effects of freezing on bone breakage. This was done to examine the effects of seasonality on butchering practices. The study indicated that the biomechanical nature of the bone was altered by freezing resulting in a visibly different breakage pattern. The Sanderson site represents a Late Prehistoric Period and the level of bone destruction is typical of the heavy processing of bone for grease that occurred during this time period. The extreme level of this destruction is typical and may indicate a butchery activity that occurred during the colder winter months...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —We {{reviewed}} native fish zoogeography in 22 major tributary basins of the Missouri River basin in the Great Plains geomorphic {{province and}} used island biogeographical ap-proaches {{to study the}} influence of basin area and isolation on <b>faunal</b> composition. Basin <b>area</b> was correlated with elevation range and basin isolation was negatively correlated with annual freeze-free days. Ninety-six species were native to the tributary basins. Ninety-one were of southern (Gulf of Mexico drainage) origin.

Twenty-five widespread species were either present among tributary basins during glaciation or colonized the region during recession of the continental glaciers. Sixty-six more restricted species presumably colonized more recently. Five species colonized from Pacific Ocean drainages via interdrainage connections in the Rocky Mountains.

A transect perpendicular to the coast at 140 N latitude was selected for seabed sampling. Eight stations were sampled in the depth range 34 m to 2546 m and characterized with respect to macrofaunal composition, abundance, biomass, diversity and feeding type. The sediments in the shelf region (34, 48, 100 m) and upper slope (525 m) were characterized by silty and sandy facies, whereas the mid slope (1001 m), lower slope (1524 m) and basin (2001, 2546 m) consisted of clayey silts.

A study of the human burials in the region of Xingó, where whole animals were buried indicates a symbolic ritual context associated with practices of human and animal burial. This grouping raises the possibility of establishing an analogy with what is found in the anthropological literature on South America, which refers to cases with similar characteristics in Peru (Huaca del Sol and Huaca de la Luna complex), where animals served as guides to the realm of death, ones which, in that context, are known as psychopomps.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, growing {{concerns}} have been raised regarding the effects of towed fishing gears, such as trawls and dredges, on deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Trawling disturbs the benthic communities both physically and biologically, and can eliminate the most vulnerable organisms and modify habitat structure; chronically disturbed communities are often dominated by opportunistic species. The European Union is under obligation to designate a network of offshore Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) {{by the end of}} 2012 based on the perceived expectation that these networks will help protect marine biodiversity and that within these <b>areas,</b> <b>faunal</b> abundance and diversity will be higher than the surrounding fished areas. The Darwin Mounds, only discovered in 1998, are located in the Rockall Trough, NE Atlantic at a depth of ~ 1000 m. Deep-water trawling regularly took place in the region of the Darwin Mounds; however in 2004 the mounds were designated as the first offshore SAC in UK and the area is now closed to bottom trawling. As part of the HERMIONE programme the influence of human impact on the Oceans was one of the key themes and in June 2011, an investigation of the macrofaunal community structure at comparable sites both inside and outside of the Darwin Mound SAC was undertaken. Macrofaunal communities were found to differ significantly, with the difference mostly driven by changes in the abundance of polychaetes, crustaceans and nematodes whilst no significant differences were seen for the other phyla. Whereas overall macrofaunal abundance was higher outside the SAC compared to within, this pattern varies considerably between phyla. Diversity indices showed no significant differences between protected and unprotected sites. This could indicate that a few years of preservation are not enough time to determine a recovery by the macrofaunal community of cold-water ecosystems and that a continued monitoring over a longer term is necessary to fully understand the impact of fishery closures...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of ‘BIOMON’, a national program for biological monitoring of marine waters, the invertebrate benthic fauna of the Dutch Continental Shelf (DCS) has been monitored from 1991 onwards. The monitoring {{is based on a}} boxcore sampling program yearly carried out in spring at 100 stations on the DCS. The aim is to generate a time series that can form a basis to detect possible trends in the development of thefauna in different areas within the DCS. From the very beginnng it became clear that in the fauna of the DCS four clusters could be discerned that are geographically well defined: the Dogger Bank, the Oyster Ground, the southern offshore area and the coastal area. At the community level there were no trendwise changes over the period of monitoring. Species diversity was consistently highest at the Dogger Bank and in the Oyster Ground, on average twice as high as in the southern offshore and coastal <b>areas.</b> <b>Faunal</b> densities were generally the highest in the Oyster Ground. The highest biomass values were found in the coastal area, due to the presence of banks of bivalves (Spisula subtruncata and Ensis americanus). At the species level a few trends were observed: the disappearance of the polychaete Aricidea minuta from the DCS around 2000 and a dip in the densities of the brittle star Amphiura filiformis in the Oyster Ground {{during the second half of}} the nineties. A rather strong decrease of silt contents of the sediment in the latter area after 2001 was not reflected in a change in the abundance of one or more common species. A comparison of the monitoring data with data collected in the period 1975 – 1981 appeared to be possible for only a few (mainly mollusc) species in the Oyster Ground, but indicated that the gastropod Turritella communis has strongly decreased since those years whereas there was a significant increase in the abundance of several small bivalve species...|$|R
40|$|Global {{threatening}} {{processes such as}} habitat loss, overexploitation, invasive species, {{and climate}} change are driving many species to extinction at an alarming rate. This has particularly affected mammal populations across Australia where mammal extinctions {{over the past two}} centuries have been the highest in the world. Setting aside areas for protection is the principle strategy for safeguarding against biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem processes. Identifying areas for protection requires comprehensive knowledge of species distributions, where relative comparisons can be made over large scales. Spatially explicit datasets, such as atlases, harbour the greatest potential of large-scale information of biodiversity. These however, are seldom fully utilised for large-scale conservation initiatives and management. This thesis provides concepts, methods, and operational guidelines for conservation efforts using large data over extensive scales. To achieve this, I utilised NSWs atlas data and focused on records of native terrestrial mammals. Chapter 1 provides an overview of global threats, conservation strategies, and specifically the state of Australias mammals. In chapter 2, I demonstrated how atlas data, collated at multiple spatial scales can be used to rank survey methods best suited for the detection of each mammal species. This approach provides a methodological process used to identify efficient monitoring strategies tailored for unique species inventories at regional and bioregional scales. Chapter 3 tests the efficacy of the existing Australian bioregional framework for representing mammal species within protected areas. The bioregional framework, which primarily relies on vegetation communities, is used to measure representation of biodiversity and prioritise new inclusions to the national protected area network. The chapter presents an alternative approach for prioritisation driven by mammal assemblages, using patterns co-occurring species. Results and performance for mammal representation are then assessed against the bioregional framework. Chapter 4 builds upon identified mammal assemblages to model anticipated effects of climate change on whole assemblages simultaneously and identify climate-resilient <b>faunal</b> communities. Identified <b>areas</b> are then used within to prioritise land for additions to the existing protected area network, given impacts of climate change on mammalian distributions. Chapter 5 examines the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms shaping Australias mammal community assemblages. By exploring trait interactions across spatial scales, a more precise scaling for evolving determinants of niche overlap are made. This provides unique insight into the evolutionary pathways and their rates, allowing identification of the scales in which these operate in shaping present-day communities. Finally, in Chapter 6, I summarise the research presented in the thesis and discuss directions for future work...|$|R
40|$|Uracanthus is a {{large group}} of longicorn beetles in the Australian Region. The larvae of this genus are borers of at least 31 genera of trees and {{parasitic}} plants, including some economically important crops such as citrus, litchi, peach, plum, and apricot. Several species are important pests of orchards. Adults visit flowers of various tree species and are attracted to the light. In this thesis, I undertook a thorough taxonomic revision, analysed the phylogeny using morphological and molecular characters, and appraised biogeographic distribution of the genus. In the taxonomic revision, I redefine the scope of the genus, describe and illustrate new and previously known species, and provide a key to all species. The revised Australian Uracanthus includes 39 species, eight of which are established as new to science: U. pseudogigas sp. nov., U. maculatus sp. nov., U. griseus sp. nov., U. bicoloratus sp. nov., U. perthensis sp. nov., U. punctulatus sp. nov., U. quadristriolatus sp. nov., and U. bistriolatus sp. nov. Six new synonyms are proposed (senior synonyms last) : U. multilineatus McKeown with U. ventralis Lea, U. dentiapicalis McKeown with U. parvus Lea, U. marginellus Hope and U. inermis Lea (not Aurivillius) with U. bivittatus Newman, U. fuscostriatus McKeown with U. lateroalbus Lea, and U. daviumbus Gressitt with U. longicornis Lea. Dorsal views of all species are presented as photographs, terminalia of both sexes illustrated, and distributions mapped. Brief comments are also given on the biology of this genus. In the full morphological phylogenetic analyses of all 39 species, I use 55 informative characters and cladistic method to test the monophylies of Uracanthus and its species groups. My results show that the monophylies of the genus and seven species groups are confirmed. However, several species groups still need additional steps to become monophyletic and are currently considered paraphyletic. In the molecular phylogenetic studies, due to the situations beyond my control (difficulties of extracting DNA from some old species and prohibitions of extracting DNA from type specimens), I analyse only 21 species. I extract and amplify the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) region of the mtDNA from 21 species and perform a phylogenetic analysis using molecular characters. To make the molecular phylogeny comparable to the morphological phylogeny, I also cladistically analyse the phylogeny of these 21 species using morphological and combined morphological-molecular characters. A comparison of trees obtained from morphological, mtDNA and combined data shows that the relationships of several closely related taxa remain constant, for example, the sister relationships of U. gigas + pseudogigas, U. insignis + punctulatus, and U. acutus + loranthi. However, the placement of U. insignis and U. punctulatus on the phylogenetic trees varies from the most basal in the full morphological analysis to the highly derived in the combined and molecular analyses. Considering the amount of available data is more limited in the molecular analysis than in the morphological analysis, the molecular phylogeny presented in this study should be interpreted with caution. The Uracanthus fauna can be divided into five subregions: the Kosciuskan, Western and Eyrean in southern and central Australia, and the Torresian and Timorian in northern Australia. The fauna are richest with highest endemism in the Kosciuskan and Western. The Kosciuskan and Western are similar in faunal composition and closely related; the Eyrean has probably acted as a <b>faunal</b> exchange transit <b>area</b> between the Kosciuskan and Western, and the two northern Australian subregions have no endemic species. When the areas of endemism of each species are attached to the phylogenetic tree generated from the full morphological analysis, a clear picture of the distribution patterns of species groups in relation to phylogeny is obtained. It is suggested that the speciation and species radiation of Uracanthus may have occurred first in the Kosciuskan, then in the Western, and finally in the Eyrean, Torresian, and Timorian...|$|R
