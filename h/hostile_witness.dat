2500|$|Many of {{the whites}} in the court room likely resented Leibowitz as a Jew from New York hired by the Communists, and for his {{treatment}} of a southern white woman, even a low-class one, as a <b>hostile</b> <b>witness.</b> Some wondered {{if there was any}} way he could leave Decatur alive. [...] The National Guard Captain Joe Burelson promised Judge Horton that he would protect Leibowitz and the defendants [...] "as long as we have a piece of ammunition or a man alive." [...] Once Captain Burelson learned that a group was on their way to [...] "take care of Leibowitz," [...] he raised the drawbridge across the Tennessee River, keeping them out of Decatur.|$|E

Attorneys can influence a <b>hostile</b> <b>witness's</b> responses by using Gestalt psychology to influence the way the witness perceives the situation, and utility theory to understand their likely responses.

In the ensuing trial, Phelps called Brady to the stand, declared her a <b>hostile</b> <b>witness,</b> and then cross-examined her for nearly a week, during which he accused her of being a [...] "slut", tried to introduce testimony from former boyfriends whom Phelps wanted to subpoena, and accused her of a variety of perverse sexual acts, ultimately reducing her to tears on the stand.

6000|$|This {{result would}} have {{actually}} followed, {{for the nation}} was ill pleased at the immoral alliance between the Foxites and the man whom, {{if they had been}} true to their opinions a thousand times repeated, they ought at that moment to have been impeaching. The Dissenters, who had hitherto been his enthusiastic admirers, but who are rigid above other men in their demand of political consistency, lamented Burke's fall in joining the Coalition, as Priestley told him many years after, as the fall of a friend and a brother. But Shelburne threw away the game. [...] "His falsehoods," [...] says Horace Walpole, [...] "his flatteries, duplicity, insincerity, arrogance, contradictions, neglect of his friends, with all the kindred of all these faults, were the daily topics of contempt and ridicule; and his folly shut his eyes, nor did he perceive that so very rapid a fall must have been owing to his own incapacity." [...] This is the testimony of a <b>hostile</b> <b>witness.</b> It is borne out, however, by a circumstance of striking significance. When the king recovered the reins at the end of 1783, not only did he send for Pitt instead of for Shelburne, but Pitt himself neither invited Shelburne to join him, nor in any way ever consulted him then or afterwards, though he had been Chancellor of the Exchequer in Shelburne's own administration.|$|E
60|$|The Bodily Structure of Man.—It is notorious {{that man}} is {{constructed}} on the same general type or model with other mammals. All the bones in his skeleton can be compared with corresponding bones in a monkey, bat, or seal. So it is with his muscles, nerves, blood-vessels and internal viscera. The brain, {{the most important of}} all the organs, follows the same law, as shewn by Huxley and other anatomists. Bischoff,[3] who is a <b>hostile</b> <b>witness,</b> admits that every chief fissure and fold in the brain of man has its analogy in that of the orang; but he adds that at no period of development do their brains perfectly agree; nor could this be expected, for otherwise their mental powers would have been the same. Vulpian[4] remarks: “Les différences réelles qui existent entre l’encéphale de l’homme et celui des singes supérieurs, sont bien minimes. Il ne faut pas se faire d’illusions à cet égard. L’homme est bien plus près des singes anthropomorphes par les caractères anatomiques de son cerveau que ceux-ci ne le sont non-seulement des autres mammifères, mais mêmes de certains quadrumanes, des guenons et des macaques.” But it would be superfluous here to give further details on the correspondence between man and the higher mammals {{in the structure of the}} brain and all other parts of the body.|$|E

She was a Party member in good standing, he declared, and had no affiliations that would bar marriage to Mao. Kang's personal knowledge of Jiang Qing's past was fragmentary and certainly insufficient to allow him to prove that she was not a KMT agent, but he doctored her record, destroyed adverse material, discouraged <b>hostile</b> <b>witnesses,</b> and coached her on how to answer the probing questions of high-level interrogators who hoped to discredit Mao.|$|R

Over the years since it was handed down, Bronston has remained, {{in the words of one}} commentator, [...] "much-maligned". Criticisms have ranged from prosecutors upset at the limitations it placed on their ability to use the threat of perjury prosecution to compel truthful testimony from <b>hostile</b> <b>witnesses</b> to a Wake Forest professor who cites it as among many aspects of the legal system that have caused a general decline in morality when they became broadly applied outside of the practice of law.|$|R

5000|$|While {{litigation}} presents {{opportunities for}} information denial through {{the rules of}} privilege and work product, even more opportunities to shape the conduct of opposing counsel and <b>hostile</b> <b>witnesses</b> arise in the orientation phase. [...] Psychology offers deep insights into how individuals perceive and misperceive information. Moreover, an individual’s perception of a situation affects how he frames his decisions. By altering perceptions, litigators can shape the decision the party will make. [...] Coupling this understanding of psychology with utility theory / economic game theory, attorneys can {{set the stage for}} adversarial parties to take actions that serve the attorneys’ plan.At the same time, the attorneys must protect their own decision-making while retaining a degree of control over the evolving situation. [...] The methods for protecting one’s own decision-making include making accurate predictions (using tools from psychology and utility theory), validating planned actions, having a clear focus of effort and information flow, and building sound, powerful, and flexible plans, as can be done using a “line of effort.” ...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 : The {{discourse}} of forensic contextsIn an adversarial common-law courtroom, where one party tries {{to defeat the}} other by using words as weapons, polysemous words {{more often than not}} pose a problem to the court interpreter. Unlike in dyadic communication, where ambiguity can be easily clarified with the speaker by the hearer, court interpreters’ freedom to clarify with speakers is to a large extent restricted by their code of ethics. Interpreters therefore can only rely on the context for disambiguating polysemous words. This study illustrates the problem of polysemy in an interpreter-mediated rape trial. It exemplifies how the interpreter’s goal to avoid contradictions by making her interpretation of a polysemous word consistent with the preceding context runs counter to that of the bilingual cross-examiner, whose primary goal is to identify inconsistencies in the <b>hostile</b> <b>witness’s</b> testimony in order to discredit him. This study also manifests a denial of the interpreter’s latitude in the interpretation of contextual clues and her loss of power in a courtroom with the presence of other bilinguals. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
