5|$|Ballistic {{annihilation}} {{describes a}} {{process by which}} moving particles and antiparticles annihilate each other when they collide. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> version of this process, the system consists of a single type of particle and antiparticle, moving at equal speeds in opposite directions in a one-dimensional medium.|$|E
5|$|If the {{reaction}} path proceeds over one or several intermediates, kcat {{will be a}} function of several elementary rate constants, whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> case of a single elementary reaction (e.g. no intermediates) it will be identical to the elementary unimolecular rate constant k2. The apparent unimolecular rate constant kcat is also called turnover number and denotes the maximum number of enzymatic reactions catalysed per second.|$|E
5|$|Selection has {{different}} effects on traits. Stabilizing selection acts {{to hold a}} trait at a stable optimum, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> case all deviations from this optimum are selectively disadvantageous. Directional selection favours extreme values of a trait. The uncommon disruptive selection also acts during transition periods when the current mode is sub-optimal, but alters the trait {{in more than one}} direction. In particular, if the trait is quantitative and univariate then both higher and lower trait levels are favoured. Disruptive selection can be a precursor to speciation.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> type of circulatory system, two lateral {{vessels are}} {{joined at the}} ends to form a loop. However, many species have {{additional}} long-wise and cross-wise vessels. There is no heart nor pumping vessels, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of both the vessels and the body wall's muscles. In some species, circulation is intermittent, and fluid ebbs and flows in the long-wise vessels. The fluid in the vessels is usually colorless, but in some species it contains cells that are yellow, orange, green or red. The red type contain hemoglobin and carry oxygen, but {{the function of the}} other pigments is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, {{but he was}} old and {{physically}} impaired when he met Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{problem to}} the one {{considered}} appears in the physics of normal-metal superconductor interfaces.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> output-limiting circuits, the RO {{is placed}} in the top (series {{connection}}) or lower (shunt) arm of the voltage divider. The series connection provides a greater controlling range (−80dB) at DC and low frequencies. The operation is complicated by the nonlinearity of the resistance vs. the controlling current. The narrowing of the dynamic range due to the parasitic capacitance is significant at frequencies as low as hundreds of Hz. The reaction is significantly faster to the increase than decrease in the controlling current.|$|E
25|$|Temporary {{heat sinks}} are {{sometimes}} used while soldering circuit boards, preventing excessive heat from damaging sensitive nearby electronics. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> case, this means partially gripping a component using a heavy metal crocodile clip, hemostat or similar clamp. Modern semiconductor devices, which {{are designed to}} be assembled by reflow soldering, can usually tolerate soldering temperatures without damage. On the other hand, electrical components such as magnetic reed switches can malfunction if exposed to hotter soldering irons, so this practice is still very much in use.|$|E
25|$|The {{processes}} {{during which}} two neutrinos (or antineutrinos) are emitted {{is known as}} two-neutrino double beta decay. If the neutrino is a Majorana particle (meaning that the antineutrino and the neutrino are actually the same particle), {{and at least one}} type of neutrino has non-zero mass (which has been established by the neutrino oscillation experiments), then it is possible for neutrinoless double beta decay to occur. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> theoretical treatment, known as light neutrino exchange, the two neutrinos annihilate each other, or equivalently, a nucleon absorbs the neutrino emitted by another nucleon.|$|E
