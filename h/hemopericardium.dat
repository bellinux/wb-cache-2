25|$|In an aortic dissection, blood penetrates the intima {{and enters}} the media layer. The high {{pressure}} rips the tissue of the media apart along the laminated plane splitting the inner two-thirds and the outer one-third of the media apart. This can propagate {{along the length of}} the aorta for a variable distance forward or backwards. Dissections that propagate towards the iliac bifurcation (with the flow of blood) are called anterograde dissections and those that propagate towards the aortic root (opposite of the flow of blood) are called retrograde dissections. The initial tear is usually within 100mm of the aortic valve, so a retrograde dissection can easily compromise the pericardium leading to a <b>hemopericardium.</b> Anterograde dissections may propagate all the way to the iliac bifurcation of the aorta, rupture the aortic wall, or recanalize into the intravascular lumen leading to a double-barrel aorta. The double-barrel aorta relieves the pressure of blood flow and reduces the risk of rupture. Rupture leads to hemorrhaging into a body cavity, and prognosis depends on the area of rupture. Retroperitoneal and pericardial ruptures are both possible.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hemopericardium</b> can be {{diagnosed}} using echocardiography, a cardiac ultrasound. Chest X-rays are also often taken when <b>hemopericardium</b> is suspected and would reveal an enlarged heart.

50|$|Symptoms of <b>hemopericardium</b> {{often include}} {{difficulty}} breathing, abnormally rapid breathing, and fatigue, {{each of which}} can be a sign of a serious medical condition not limited to <b>hemopericardium.</b> In many cases, patients also report feeling chest pressure and have an abnormally elevated heart rate.|$|E
5000|$|Studies have {{recently}} shown that <b>hemopericardium</b> can occur spontaneously {{in people with}} essential thrombocythaemia, although this is relatively rare.

5000|$|When discovered, <b>hemopericardium</b> {{is usually}} treated by pericardiocentesis, a {{procedure}} wherein a needle {{is used to}} remove the fluid from the pericardial sac. This procedure typically utilizes an 8-cm, 18-gauge needle that is inserted between the xiphoid process and the left costal margin until it enters the pericardial sac, when it can then be used to drain the fluid from the sac. [...] A catheter is often left in the pericardium to continue draining any remaining fluid after the initial procedure. The catheter can be removed when the <b>hemopericardium</b> no longer persists. The underlying causes of the condition, such as over-prescription of anticoagulants, must be addressed as well so that the <b>hemopericardium</b> does not return.|$|E
50|$|There {{have also}} been cases {{reported}} in which <b>hemopericardium</b> was noted as an initial manifestation of essential thrombocythemia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemopericardium</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to result from various afflictions including chest trauma, free wall rupture after a myocardial infarction, bleeding into the pericardial sac following a type A aortic dissection, and as a complication of invasive cardiac procedures. Acute leukemia has also been reported as a cause of the condition. Several cases of <b>hemopericardium</b> have also been reported as a side-effect of anticoagulants. Patients should be made aware of this fact when prescribed these drugs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemopericardium</b> {{refers to}} {{blood in the}} pericardial sac of the heart. It is {{clinically}} similar to a pericardial effusion, and, depending on the volume and rapidity with which it develops, may cause cardiac tamponade.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hemopericardium</b> is a {{condition}} that affects the cardiovascular system. It typically begins with blood accumulating in the pericardial sac posterior to the heart, and eventually expands to surround the entire heart. The fluid build-up then causes pressure within the pericardial sac to increase. If the pressure becomes greater than the intracardiac pressure of the heart, compression of the adjacent cardiac chambers can occur. [...] This compression, called cardiac tamponade, {{is often associated with}} <b>hemopericardium</b> and can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Early signs of this compression include right atrial inversion during ventricular systole followed by diastolic compression of the right ventricular outflow tract.|$|E
50|$|While <b>hemopericardium</b> {{itself is}} not fatal, it may lead to cardiac tamponade, which can be deadly if not treated promptly. One study found that cardiac tamponade was fatal in 13.3% of cases {{in which it was}} not caused by a {{malignant}} disease.|$|E
50|$|While CPR is a {{last resort}} intervention, without which a person without a pulse will all but {{certainly}} die, the physical nature of how CPR is performed does lead to complications that {{may need to be}} rectified. Common complications due to CPR are rib fractures, sternal fractures, bleeding in the anterior mediastinum, heart contusion, <b>hemopericardium,</b> upper airway complications, damage to the abdominal viscera - lacerations of the liver and spleen, fat emboli, pulmonary complications - pneumothorax, hemothorax, lung contusions.|$|E
50|$|Left {{ventricular}} free wall rupture {{almost always}} results in <b>hemopericardium</b> (the exception {{being in the}} scenario where the patient has had prior open heart surgery and has obliterative fibrous pericardial adhesions; these would prevent egress of blood) and pericardial tamponade. An accumulation of as little as 75 ml of blood, acquired acutely in a patient without pre-existing pericardial effusion, is sufficient to produce tamponade (wherein the ventricles are incapable of filling and are thus incapable of producing adequate stroke volume).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} 2 {{cases of}} <b>hemopericardium</b> following treatment with dabigatran. CASE SUMMARIES: A 70 -year-old male {{with a history}} of dabigatran use presented with cough, fatigue, and bloody stools. The patient had a large hyperdense pericardial effusion caused by accumulation of bloody fluid, leading to hypotension and shock. Approximately 1000 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was drained from the pericardial space. A 77 -year-old female was admitted for treatment of pneumonia and atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran was initiated and, after 6 doses, the patient developed abdominal pain, respiratory distress, and shock. She was diagnosed with pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis procedures removed a cumulative total of 2000 mL of bloody fluid. DISCUSSION: Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor approved for the reduction of stroke and systemic embolism risk in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. In December 2011, the Food and Drug Administration released a statement describing serious bleeding events associated with dabigatran use. According to the Naranjo scale, the cases presented here had probable associations between <b>hemopericardium</b> and dabigatran. While there is no known literature supporting this relationship, there are documented cases of warfarin-induced <b>hemopericardium.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These case reports highlight the potential for dabigatran to cause <b>hemopericardium</b> and cardiac tamponade. Additional reports may better elucidate (or characterize) the risk of dabigatran-induced <b>hemopericardium</b> and cardiac tamponade...|$|E

40|$|Post mortem {{computed}} tomography (PMCT) {{can be used}} as a triage tool to better identify cases with a possibly non-natural cause of death, especially when high caseloads make it impossible to perform autopsies on all cases. Substantial data can be generated by modern medical scanners, especially in a forensic setting where the entire body is documented at high resolution. A solution for the resulting issues could be the use of deep learning techniques for automatic analysis of radiological images. In this article, we wanted to test the feasibility of such methods for forensic imaging by hypothesizing that deep learning methods can detect and segment a <b>hemopericardium</b> in PMCT. For deep learning image analysis software, we used the ViDi Suite 2. 0. We retrospectively selected 28 cases with, and 24 cases without, <b>hemopericardium.</b> Based on these data, we trained two separate deep learning networks. The first one classified images into hemopericardium/not <b>hemopericardium,</b> and the second one segmented the blood content. We randomly selected 50 % of the data for training and 50 % for validation. This process was repeated 20 times. The best performing classification network classified all cases of <b>hemopericardium</b> from the validation images correctly with only a few false positives. The best performing segmentation network would tend to underestimate the amount of blood in the pericardium, which is the case for most networks.

40|$|Abstract Background Cardiac tamponade {{is a rare}} but severe {{complication}} of pericardial effusion with a poor prognosis. Prompt diagnosis using transthoracic echocardiography allows guiding initial therapeutic management. Although etiologies are numerous, cardiac tamponade is more often due to a <b>hemopericardium.</b> Rarely, a coronary injury may result in such a <b>hemopericardium</b> with cardiac tamponade. Coronary artery aneurysm are the main etiologies but blunt, open chest trauma or {{complication of}} endovascular procedures have also been described. Case presentation A 83 -year-old hypertensive man presented for dizziness and hypotension. The patient had oliguria and mottled skin. Transthoracic echocardiography disclosed a circumferential pericardial effusion with a compressed right atrium, confirmed by contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scan. A pig-tail catheter allowed to withdraw 500 mL of blood, resulting in a transient improvement of hemodynamics. Rapidly, recurrent hypotension prompted a reoperation. An active bleeding was identified {{at the level of}} the retroventricular coronary artery. The pericardium was thickened with several "sharping" calcified plaques in the vicinity of the bleeding areas. On day 2, vasopressors were stopped and the patient was successfully extubated. Final diagnosis was a spontaneous cardiac tamponade secondary to a coronary artery injury attributed to a "sharping"calcified pericardial plaque.
