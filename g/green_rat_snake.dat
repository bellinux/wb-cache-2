50|$|Belize {{is home to}} many {{different}} tropical snake species, including both venomous and nonvenomous snakes. The families found in Belize consist of Colubridae, Boidae, Elapidae and Viperidae, of which the latter two families are highly venomous and may present a potential health hazard to humans if provoked. Out of 1500 different species of colubrids known in the world, 60 of these species live in the tropical habitats of Belize. Many of the colubrid species found in Belize are often Neotropical forms of the Neartic colubrids found in Mexico, the United States, and Canada, {{with some of the}} species of colubrid snakes consisting of the water snakes, brown snakes, garter snakes, whip <b>snakes,</b> <b>green</b> <b>snakes,</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> and king snakes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>Snakes,</b> <b>Rat</b> or Barn <b>Snakes</b> and Garden Snakes are {{examples}} of non-venomous snakes seen across the hollows and wide bottoms along the major rivers, sharing habitat with the copperhead. Painted turtles live in most ponds and brooks. These and major rivers also hold snapping turtles, hunted as a delicacy with a WVDNR permit. The box turtle is found in nearly every meadow and wood.|$|R
50|$|Whitetail {{deer are}} the largest {{indigenous}} mammals found in the Southeast, {{with the exception of}} small, isolated populations of black bear and the endangered Florida panther. Many small mammals inhabit this region including raccoons, fox squirrels, eastern gray squirrels, foxes, cottontail rabbits, armadillos and opossums. Bobwhite and wild turkey are the main game bird that {{can be found in the}} region. Other very common birds found in the Southeast are mourning doves, pine warbler, cardinal, summer tanager, Carolina wren, ruby-throated hummingbird, blue jay, hooded warbler, eastern towhee, and tufted titmouse. Many non-game migratory birds and migratory waterfowl are common as well. The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker is also native to the region. Numerous species of reptiles and amphibians can be found here as well, such as the American alligator, common and alligator snapping turtles, fence and glass lizards, and salamanders. The forest snake species found include cottonmouth moccasin, copperhead, rough <b>green</b> <b>snake,</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> coachwhip, and speckled kingsnake. Manatees are found in estuaries and channels throughout the state. Coral reefs serve as habitat for many tropical fish species.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{following}} snakes {{were located}} and acquired: two albino black rat snakes; one xanthlc black <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> one hypoplgmented black <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> with phenotype not previ-ously described; one leucistic Texas <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> one F, wild-type black <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> heterozy-gous for albinism, and one male and two female F ^ wild-type Texas <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> heterozy-gous for albinism. Between 1975 and 1983 these snakes {{were subjected to}} various breed-ing combinations to determine their genetics. The results of 29 matings are summarized. All of the aberrant phenotypes {{were found to be}} autosomal recessive mutations. Allellc and nonallellc forms of albinism were found to exist in the black <b>rat</b> <b>snake.</b> The xanthlc form of hypopigmentatlon was found to be tyroslnase-positive partial albinism. Leucism In the Texas <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> appears to be associated with bilateral exophthalmos in some in-stances. The previously undescribed black <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> phenotype was designated "brlndle" because of its appearance. It appears to be a genetically determined alteration In the quantity or quality of pigment, or both, and it does not undergo ontogenetic loss of pattern. It is not a form of tyrosinase-positive albinism analogous to the xanthlc phenotype.

50|$|Most of the Elaphe {{start their}} {{hibernation}} in October and emerge {{again the next}} Spring. The length of the hibernation period varies among species. Elaphe longissima, or Aesculapian snake, may hibernate {{for as long as}} from October to next May as it is among the northernmost occurring <b>rat</b> <b>snakes.</b> However, Elaphe bimaculata, or the twin-spotted <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> only need to hibernate for 2 to 3 months.Interestingly, species like black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> or Elaphe obsoleta, like to hibernate with other <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> and/or many other snake species, most notably timber rattlesnakes, racers, and bull snakes.|$|R

50|$|Though beauty <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> are {{typically}} in less accessible caves, the top predators of these serpents are birds and mammals. Currently, {{there is no}} specific information of the predators of beauty <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> available.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rat</b> <b>snakes</b> {{are most}} {{vulnerable}} to predators as juveniles. Predators of P. alleghaniensis include hawks (Buteo spp.), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), foxes, raccoons, and domestic cats. Adult eastern <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> have few known predators other than humans. When frightened, a <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> will freeze. If harassed, it will produce a foul-smelling musk to deter predators. If provoked further, it may coil, shake its tail, and snap at its attacker.|$|R
50|$|Predators {{of adult}} red-bellied {{woodpeckers}} include {{birds of prey}} such as sharp-shinned hawks and Cooper's hawks, black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> and house cats. Known predators of nestlings and eggs include red-headed woodpeckers, owls, pileated woodpeckers, gray <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> and black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes.</b> When approached by a predator, red-bellied woodpeckers either hide from the predator, or harass it with alarm calls. They defend their nests and young aggressively, and may directly attack predators that come near the nest.|$|R
5000|$|Euprepiophis conspicillatus, {{commonly}} known as the Japanese forest <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> is a species of nonvenomous colubrid snake endemic to Japan.

50|$|Relatively small, {{the beauty}} <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> {{typically}} feeds on ground rodents such as mice and, {{due to the}} snake's climbing abilities, even bats that are roosting within the caves they share. In addition to small mammals, beauty <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> have also been known to eat birds and bird eggs occasionally. As constrictors, this species uses heat receptors to find prey by sensing the prey's body heat.
