40|$|The <b>guenons</b> (Cercopithecus spp.) of Central Africa are medium-sized, mostly frugivorous or {{granivorous}} monkeys, {{which are}} able to adapt their diet to some extent to the available resources at a given site or in a given season (Gautier-Hion, 1988 a; Gautier-Hion, Gautier & Maisels, 1993; Tutin et al., 1997; Chapman et al., 2002; Lambert, 2002). Among all <b>guenons,</b> insects comprise between 10 % and 20 % of the diet (Chapman et al., 2002). In Gabon, <b>guenons</b> are mostly frugivorous (Gautier-Hion, 1980; Tutin et al., 1997; Tutin, 1999), but the degree of insectivory varies with habitat. In one study in closed-canopy forest in northern Gabon, {{the proportion of the}} total dry weight ingested by <b>guenons</b> ranged between 10 % and 15 % (Gautier-Hion, 1980). In a second study in Lope´, central Gabon, also in closed-canopy forest with high fruit abundance and diversity, insect eating only comprised 3 - 9 % of the total time spent feeding (Tutin et al., 1997). However during a study in a fruit-poor forest fragment in a savannah area of Lope´, guenon's time budget included 24 - 35 % spent feeding on insects (Tutin, 1999) ...|$|R

25|$|Zoo-keeping {{seems in}} fact, in the {{surviving}} evidence, {{the most common}} work performed by dwarfs. Royal zookeepers mostly {{took care of the}} king's pets such as hunting dogs, domestic cats and guenons. This may be because these animals were very easy to tame and would not become a danger to the dwarfs. A unique relief from the mastaba of the high official Nyankhnesw (6th Dynasty) shows a dwarf taking a leopard for a walk. In another tomb (that of the high official Nofer, also of the 6th Dynasty), one relief shows a dwarf and his <b>guenon</b> while the little ape pilfers grapes from a fruit basket and plays with his cord. Further Old Kingdom reliefs suggest that guenons literally assisted their keepers: in the tomb of Kaaper a unique relief depicts a dwarf and his <b>guenon,</b> as they both specify the clock for a pair of musicians. In contrast, depictions of dwarfs working themselves as musicians are very rare.|$|E

Rene <b>Guenon</b> founded the gnostic review, Le Gnose in 1909, before moving to a more Perennialist position, and founding his Traditionalist School. Gnostic Thelemite organizations, such as Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica and Ordo Templi Orientis, trace themselves to Crowley's thought.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} Westerners have {{embarked}} {{with varying degrees}} of success on the path of Sufism. One of the first to return to Europe as an official representative of a Sufi order, and with the specific purpose to spread Sufism in Western Europe, was the Swedish-born wandering Sufi Ivan Aguéli. René <b>Guénon,</b> the French scholar, became a Sufi {{in the early twentieth century}} and was known as Sheikh Abdul Wahid Yahya. His manifold writings defined the practice of Sufism as the essence of Islam but also pointed to the universality of its message. Other spiritualists, such as George Gurdjieff, may or may not conform to the tenets of Sufism as understood by orthodox Muslims.|$|E
25|$|A piece {{authored}} in 1930 saw Eliade defining Julius Evola {{as a great}} thinker {{and offering}} praise to the controversial intellectuals Oswald Spengler, Arthur de Gobineau, Houston Stewart Chamberlain and the Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg. Evola, who continued to defend the core principles of mystical fascism, once protested to Eliade about the latter's failure to cite him and <b>Guénon.</b> Eliade replied that his works were written for a contemporary public, and not to initiates of esoteric circles. After the 1960s, he, together with Evola, Louis Rougier, and other intellectuals, offered support to Alain de Benoist's controversial Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne, part of the Nouvelle Droite intellectual trend.|$|E
50|$|The {{classification}} of the Chlorocebus monkeys is undergoing change.

More species and subspecies {{are expected to be}} identified as scientists study this genus further.|$|R
50|$|Among cercopithecines, forest <b>guenons</b> such as Wolf's mona monkey {{have very}} {{developed}} cheek pouches. These cheek pouches are {{second only to}} macaques.

25|$|In {{his work}} on the history of religion, Eliade is most highly {{regarded}} for his writings on Alchemy, Shamanism, Yoga and what he called the eternal return—the implicit belief, supposedly present in religious thought in general, that religious behavior is not only an imitation of, but also a participation in, sacred events, and thus restores the mythical time of origins. Eliade's thinking was in part influenced by Rudolf Otto, Gerardus van der Leeuw, Nae Ionescu and the writings of the Traditionalist School (René <b>Guénon</b> and Julius Evola). For instance, Eliade's The Sacred and the Profane partially builds on Otto's The Idea of the Holy to show how religion emerges from the experience of the sacred, and myths of time and nature.|$|E
25|$|In {{the cult}} of Shiva, found in Anatolia from circa 6,000 BC, the young, naked ithyphallic god appears in a horned mask. In the Greek bacchanalia and the Dionysus cult, which {{involved}} the use of masks, the ordinary controls on behaviour were temporarily suspended, and people cavorted in merry revelry outside their ordinary rank or status. René <b>Guénon</b> claims that in the Roman saturnalia festivals, the ordinary roles were often inverted. Sometimes a slave or a criminal was temporarily granted the insignia and status of royalty, only to be killed after the festival ended. The Carnival of Venice, in which all are equal behind their masks, dates back to 1268 AD. The use of carnivalesque masks in the Jewish Purim festivities probably originated in the late 15th century, although some Jewish authors claim {{it has always been}} part of Judaic tradition.|$|E
25|$|Douala Edéa Wildlife Reserve, a {{wildlife}} reserve in the Littoral Region of Cameroon, {{is located on}} either side of the mouth of the Sanaga River along the shores of the Bight of Biafra opposite the island of Bioko. The reserve was established in 1932. As of 2000, it covered 160,000 hectares (400,000 acres). Cameroon designated the reserve as {{a wildlife}} park for scientific purposes in 1971, Lake Tissongo, a lagoon connected to the south bank of the Sanaga river by a 5 kilometres (3.1mi) tidal channel, is included in the reserve. 80% of the reserve is covered by tropical lowland equatorial forest, and 15% by Atlantic mangrove forests. Fauna include forest elephants, primates (chimpanzees, monkey species such as black colobus), antelopes (sitatunga, blue duiker, etc.), West African manatees, sea turtles, dolphins, crocodiles, alligator, many fish species, terrestrial and water bird species. The red-capped mangabey was reported to be common in the reserve in 1972. The endangered red-eared nose-spotted <b>guenon</b> was reported in the Lombé part of the reserve in densities of 2-3 groups per square kilometers, but populations had dropped elsewhere due to hunting.|$|E
50|$|The Biaka (Bayaka) and Baka pygmies of the {{northern}} Congo basin relate tales of the Mokèlé-mbèmbé, a legendary, dinosaur-like creature purportedly inhabiting the Lake Tele region of the Republic of the Congo (ROC). It is thought to feed on Landolphia, a type of liana. Other denizens of the ROC include moustached <b>guenons,</b> crowned <b>guenons,</b> red colobus monkeys, okapis and the blue duiker. Figs sustain great blue turacos, black mangabeys and various hornbills. The forests of Tanzania’s Gombe National Park support common chimpanzees and the bais of Dzanga-Sangha National Park in the Central African Republic support numbers of forest elephant. Other Congolese inhabitants featured include red river hogs, bongos, forest buffalo, orb-web spiders and colonial spiders. Returning again to the ROC, the Biaka are seen to expertly craft Portuguese-style crossbows and arrows made from seven different kinds of wood and other plants.

50|$|In one study, Wolf's mona monkeys {{were found}} associating with Bonobos within 20 metres {{for an average}} time of 20 minutes (although {{sometimes}} for over an hour). These interactions were mainly initiated by, and departed by, the guenons; this indicates that the <b>guenons</b> most benefited from these associations. Although the common chimpanzee is known to hunt sympatric primates, {{this is not the}} case with the Bonobo. No aggressive interactions occurred during the study period. The red-tailed monkey (C. ascanius) was also found to associate with Bonobos, and on five occasions the association was initiated by a mixed group of <b>guenons</b> (C. ascanius and C. wolfi). When a mixed group was involved in the association, it always lasted for over an hour. Interactions occurred once every seven hours. Associations mainly occurred while the bonobos were feeding or resting. Wolf's mona monkey was found to feed in the trees while the bonobo fed or rested.|$|R
