5|$|Beiderbecke's most {{influential}} recordings date from {{his time with}} Goldkette and Whiteman, although they were generally recorded under his own name or Trumbauer's. The Whiteman period also marked a precipitous <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> Beiderbecke's health, {{brought on by the}} demand of the bandleader's relentless touring and recording schedule in combination with Beiderbecke's persistent alcoholism. A few stints in rehabilitation centers, as well as the support of Whiteman and the Beiderbecke family in Davenport, did not check Beiderbecke's <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> health. He left the Whiteman band in 1930 and the following summer died in his Queens apartment at the age of 28.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEvidence {{suggests}} substantial <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> HIV prevalence {{in parts}} of sub-Saharan Africa. However, the observed aggregate declines {{at the national level}} may obscure local variations in the temporal dynamics of the infection. Using spatial scan statistics, we identified marked spatial variability <b>in</b> the within-country <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> HIV prevalence in Tanzania, Malawi, Kenya, and Zimbabwe. Our study suggests that the <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> the national HIV prevalence in some of the SSA countries may not be representative of downward trends in prevalence in areas of high HIV prevalence, as much as the result of sharp <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> prevalence in areas of already low HIV prevalence. Our findings provide insights for resource allocation and HIV prevention interventions in these countries...|$|R

40|$|Plant species {{diversity}} has <b>declined</b> rapidly <b>in</b> grasslands, {{and it is}} poorly known how {{to establish and maintain}} diverse mixtures containing grasses, forbs, and legumes. Each of these groups can be important in at least some situations, with grasses and forbs producing forage and increasing resistance to weeds, and legumes producing forage and maintaining high fertility by fixing nitrogen. There is some evidence that exotic (introduced) plant species and changes in land use are contributing to <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> diversity. Exotic species could be causing <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> diversity in situations where they differ from native plant species in growth rates and other plant traits. However, previous studies were based on correlative data, and we have a poor understanding of whether exotic species themselves are causing direct <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> diversity or if associated land-use changes are causing the <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> diversity...|$|R
5|$|In 2012, however, it was {{reported}} that the series' ratings were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the series might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> Nickelodeon's overall ratings. Media analyst Todd Juenger directly attributes the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> Nickelodeon's ratings to the availability of streaming video content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media.|$|E

Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the common myna.|$|E

5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.|$|E
