But their power is only as great as their surroundings, which are very much shaped by human contrivance. They are, in fact, fire-variants of kept creatures.

40|$|Farmer {{participatory}} tillage {{trials were}} conducted in a highland Vertisol area of Ethiopia during the 1999 and 2000 cropping seasons. This participatory initiative clearly demonstrated that incorporating farmers’ knowledge, ideas and preferences could improve the wheat production package. A traditional practice of Chefe Donsa farmers—applying ash from their homesteads to their fields to enable early-sown crops to withstand frost—led to the verification of the yield-enhancing effect of inorganic potassium fertilizer on wheat. Farmer adoption of a minimum tillage production system increased the gross margin of wheat production by US$ 132 per hectare—based on 1999 prices—relative to the traditional flat seedbed system. The minimum tillage system was characterized by a much lower level of soil manipulation relative to the traditional flat seedbed system, and, as a consequence, markedly reduced the total human labor and <b>draft</b> <b>oxen</b> requirements for wheat production. Thus, the minimum tillage system could be an effective intervention for soil conservation due to early-season vegetative cover of the soil surface.

Using a farming system approach, we investigate how the distribution of key resources among farming households influence their engagement in soil maintenance practices such as fallowing, manuring, crop rotation, chemical fertilizer, terracing, stone diversion, tree planting and contour plowing. Among these practices we stress households' use of animal dung because their ability to use dung as manure is limited by their use of animal dung as primary source of fuel. We stratify households {{by the number of}} <b>draft</b> <b>oxen</b> they own and gender head of households both of which have shown to reflect households' access to key resources. In contrast to the simple perception that the poor are active agents of environmental degradation, our findings reveal that households' engagement in soil maintenance practices are complex and not necessarily reflection of their access to key resources. The results of our investigation indicate that while female headed households engage less in soil maintenance practices the same clear trend is not present among households with less oxen.

40|$|Ethiopia has {{the largest}} {{livestock}} population in Africa with approximately 30 million cattle, of which 9 to 10 million oxen are used for draft purposes. About 85 percent of the estimated 55 million human population lives in rural areas, with agriculture as the primary occupation. About 90 percent of these rural communities use draft animals for various purposes. Among farmers who use draft animal power, about 29 percent have a pair, 8 percent three or more, 34 percent have one and 29 percent have no <b>oxen.</b> Access to <b>draft</b> power at specific {{time of the year}} can therefore be a key factor influencing the crop agriculture. The Ethiopian highlands represent 40 percent of the total land mass of 1, 098, 000 km 2 and is inhabited by about 90 percent of the human population. The main purpose of keeping cattle in the highlands is for draft power, and it is estimated to account for about 60 percent of the cattle product by value. In crop production, <b>draft</b> <b>oxen</b> are estimated to contribute to more than 26 percent of the total labour requirements. About 66 percent of the country's 14 million crop land is cultivated with the use of animal power. The average land size in the highlands is about 2. 5 hectares and land preparation and subsequent cultivation is done primarily with a pair of oxen drawing the maresha. It is estimated that herds of 8 to 10 cattle have to be kept by individual farmers at any one time to ensure availability of a pair of working oxen during land cultivation. The major feed resources that support livestock in the highlands include about 23 million hectares of grazing land and crop residues. Zebu oxen are the main animals used for tillage and threshing. In some areas where oxen are in short supply, horses, mules and donkeys are either hitched with the same species or in mixed pairs. Sometimes oxen are paired with equine or barren cows for ploughing. Oxen work for about 2 months per year, although the work potential of draft cattle can be 8 to 10 months as is estimated in India. The non-use of oxen for transport and other task during the long non-cultivation period {{is one of the reasons}} for the low utilization of oxen in Ethiopia. In the last three decades to 1991, food production per head fell steadily, mainly as a result of civil war, soil exhaustion, erosion and over-population in the marginal highland agrarian areas. This created dependence on food imports ranging from 100, 000 tons in 1980 to 1 million tons in 1995 / 96 as a result of favourable weather and intervention. However, the growing scale of the structural food deficit indicates that the country needs to produce an extra 320, 000 tons of food per year simply to keep pace with population growth. Almost all the food production is dependent on mainly <b>draft</b> <b>oxen</b> which plough a total land area of about 7 million ha, generating a total power output of 250, 566, 840 kwh per year. The draft power generated for ploughing per year would be equivalent to about 27 percent of the total amount of electricity sold in the country. Availability of oxen and their work efficiency could have substantial impact of food production.

Furthermore, various data sources, including crop enterprise budgets, project reports, expert opinions and group discussions, were used. The findings of the study showed that in the Eastern Caprivi 81 % of the farmers used oxen, with an additional 8 % using oxen and tractors. Nine percent of the farmers used tractors, and only 2. 2 % used a hand hoe exclusively. Eighty-three percent felt that the use of oxen was an essential and sustainable farm power source.

60|$|The {{mechanical}} revolution, {{the process}} of mechanical invention and discovery, was a new thing in human experience and it went on regardless of the social, political, economic and industrial consequences it might produce. The industrial revolution, on the other hand, like most other human affairs, was and {{is more and more}} profoundly changed and deflected by the constant variation in human conditions caused by the mechanical revolution. And the essential difference between the amassing of riches, the extinction of small farmers and small business men, and the phase of big finance in the latter centuries of the Roman Republic on the one hand, and the very similar concentration of capital in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries}} on the other, lies in the profound difference in the character of labour that the mechanical revolution was bringing about. The power of the old world was human power; everything depended ultimately upon the driving power of human muscle, the muscle of ignorant and subjugated men. A little animal muscle, supplied by <b>draft</b> <b>oxen,</b> horse traction and the like, contributed. Where a weight had to be lifted, men lifted it; where a rock had to be quarried, men chipped it out; where a field had to be ploughed, men and oxen ploughed it; the Roman equivalent of the steamship was the galley with its bank of sweating rowers. A vast proportion of mankind in the early civilizations were employed in purely mechanical drudgery. At its onset, power-driven machinery did not seem to promise any release from such unintelligent toil. Great gangs {367} of men were employed in excavating canals, in making railway cuttings and embankments, and the like. The number of miners increased enormously. But the extension of facilities and the output of commodities increased much more. And as the nineteenth century went on, the plain logic of the new situation asserted itself more clearly. Human beings were no longer wanted as a source of mere indiscriminated power. What could be done mechanically by a human being could be done faster and better by a machine. The human being was needed now only where choice and intelligence had to be exercised. Human beings were wanted only as human beings. The drudge, on whom all the previous civilizations had rested, the creature of mere obedience, the man whose brains were superfluous, had become unnecessary to the welfare of mankind.|$|R
40|$|The World Bank {{argued that}} West Africa's Guinea Savannah zone forms part of “Africa's Sleeping Giant,” where {{increases}} in agricultural production {{could be an}} engine of economic growth, through expansion of cultivated land in sparsely populated areas. The district of Bougouni, in southern Mali, falls within this zone. We used multiple data sources including a panel survey, remote sensing-based land cover classification, population data, and farmer focus group discussions, to investigate whether the area is following a commonly-described pathway of agricultural intensification due to increasing land scarcity. We then used our understanding of historical change to explore plausible future pathways. Bougouni forms part of the expansion zone of the CMDT, which since the mid- 1980 s has provided support for intensive agricultural systems of cotton-maize rotations with animal traction and use of mineral fertilizer. In {{the period of the}} panel survey (1994 – 2012), cropped land at household level was correlated with household size: households with less than one full team of <b>draft</b> <b>oxen</b> cultivated 0. 50 ha/family member, while households with two or more teams cultivated 0. 82 ha/family member (R 2 > 0. 8). At the village level, cropped land increases varied with the amount of remaining available land and the importance of off-farm income. We see some intensification in maize and cotton, and corresponding improvements in food self-sufficiency. However, despite increasing fertilizer use, average maize and cotton yields remain around 1600 and 900 kg/ha respectively, well below national averages. Other crops are still grown in outfields relying on long fallows with limited nutrient inputs. Thus rather than either intensification or extensification the agricultural situation may be best described as stagnation. This may be due to limited incentives to invest in agriculture when compared to opportunities such as gold mining or small businesses, which (in 2012) contribute at least 25 % of household income to ten out of 29 households. In future, cropland expansion will likely continue, which could lead to increased conflict between farmers and transhumant herders, and could lead to increased inequality at village level. Factors mitigating the tendency to land expansion include opportunities for off-farm income and migration, or market opportunities and capacity to produce high-value crops such as mango, cashew, or vegetables. This could preserve some remaining savannah area for grazing use and conservation purposes. Understanding household livelihood systems as part of a network of complex social and ecological factors allows the identification and exploration of multiple viable pathways towards desirable futures. </p...|$|R

Productivity and {{economic}} risks. his second part concerns {{the analysis of}} land productivity and labour results within a traditional farming system and two improved systems experimented on a site in the center-west part of the Senegalese groundnut basin. Intensified farming systems associate farming and livestock and use motorized or <b>draft</b> cultivation (<b>oxen)</b> as means of mechanization. Results show that intensification systematically increases crop yields and gives rise to larger amounts of by-products fitting well for use as animal feed. Furthermore, yields stabilize with soil fertility improvement. The economic risk linked to intensification strongly depends on the climatic context. A 400 mm annual rainfall appears as a threshold to insure a net increase of land and labour productivity, justifying an intensification operation that combines plowing, liming material, organic and minerai fertilizer applications. In the climatic risk zone like that where the experimentation took place, the diversification of farming activity increases and stabilizes income. Therefore, productions as cassava or bissap and the integration of a perennial forage crop offer interesting development perspectives. The constraints limiting the adoption of intensified and diversified farming systems are linked to market conditions, time-labour feasibility, soil fertility management and institutional context. To minimize the risks, tactical adjustments are also analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Farmers in {{semi-arid}} West Africa {{could get}} more {{work out of}} their oxen simply by slightly modifying the way they manage their animals, {{according to a recent}} report from the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine (CTVM), Edinburgh, UK and the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Kenya. Key elements among the report's recommendations are that farmers should use larger-framed oxen, keep them 'in 'training' by working them during the dry season, and work them during the cool periods of the day The study found that the amount of work <b>draft</b> <b>oxen</b> can do is more dependent on their body weight than on their body condition, so farmers should select large-framed animals. Trying to keep oxen in good condition during the dry season is largely a waste of feed: the better the initial body condition of the oxen, the more weight they lost when working. A better strategy is to feed the oxen well after the working period, as they then rapidly regain the live weight lost through compensatory growth. The report highlights the need to keep oxen 'm training during the dry season. In semi-arid areas the growing season is short, so farmers need their draft animals to work hard from the outset. Trials showed that the amount of work oxen could do increased as the sea progressed, indicating that the animals were 'out of practice at the start of the season. Farmers could therefore get more work out of their oxen at the beginning of the rains by making them pull carts throughout the dry season. The report also recommends that farmers work their animals during the cool periods of the day and provide shade and water during rest. This is based on findings that power output was greatest when air temperature was lowest, and that extra water also boosted power output. It would seem that the extra water helps the animals dissipate excess heated stored during work. Feeding practices will obviousIy affect how much work the animals can do, and the report makes a number of recommendations on how to feed oxen better. These focus on making better use of local roughages by supplementing them with brans, oilseed cakes and hay wherever available. Feed is plentiful during the rainy season and farmers must do more to conserve this feed for use during the dry season, the report states. Incorporating these feeding and work strategies into the existing farming systems in semi-arid areas will enable farmers to make more efficient use of their draft animals. 1 Mr Abdou Foll CTVM Easter Bush Roslin Midlothian EH 25 9 RG UKFarmers in semi-arid West Africa could get more work out of their oxen simply by slightly modifying the way they manage their animals, {{according to a recent report}} from the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine (CTVM), Edinburgh, UK and the [...] ...|$|R

The furnaces were heated by natural gas brought by bamboo pipes, yet gas brought up from [...] below the surface could cause an explosion {{if it was not}} properly mixed with oxygen first, so the Han-era Chinese built underground carburetor chambers and siphoned some of the gas off with exhaust pipes. The drill bit for digging boreholes was operated by a team of men jumping on and off a beam while the boring tool was rotated by a <b>draft</b> animal, usually <b>oxen</b> or water buffaloes. Han boreholes dug for collecting brine could reach hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the Earth's surface. Mining shafts dating to the Han dynasty have been found which reach depths of hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the earth, complete with spacious underground rooms structured by timber frames along with ladders and iron tools left behind.|$|R
40|$|Cambodia has {{achieved}} food security {{with respect to}} rice production and now {{has an opportunity to}} pay more attention to boosting production of upland crops such as maize (corn), soybean, sesame, mungbean, cassava, peanut and cowpea. While rice remains the main crop in Cambodia, the production of other crops is undergoing a rapid expansion and will be especially important for the development of those parts of the Kingdom unsuited to lowland rice. We present results from socio-economic surveys carried out in the Battambang, Kampong Cham and Takeo Provinces to identify available resources, management practices and key constraints for emerging upland cropping systems. These are mainly cash crops, so the important issues to consider are profitability, technological and management changes, and household and social issues. The surveys were conducted in the Districts of Kamrieng, Sampov Lun, Rotonak Mondol and Banan in Battambang Province, Chamkar Leu, Ou Reang Ov and Tbong Khmum in Kampong Cham Province, and Tramkak in Takeo Province. Sample sizes were 181 in Battambang and Kampong Cham, and 50 in Takeo. Generally farm families had a male head aged in the mid- 40 s, with 3 to 4 years of schooling. However, there are significant numbers of female farmers among survey respondents. Family size averaged 5 to 6 persons; with 2 to 3 being dependents and levels of off-farm work very low. Average farm size was 2 to 8 ha, and capital items owned included <b>draft</b> animals, <b>ox</b> carts and mouldboard ploughs, as well as tractors and disc ploughs in some areas. The main reasons given for not growing crops were poor yield performance, lack of knowledge (especially about insects), concerns about profitability, land/soil constraints, labour/equipment issues, and agronomic and climate risk (including drought). These results point to the need for focused research on new technologies and management as they affect crop yields and profits, and for increased extension of this information to Cambodian farmers...|$|R
