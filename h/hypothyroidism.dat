5|$|<b>Hypothyroidism</b> {{is caused}} by {{inadequate}} function of the gland itself (primary <b>hypothyroidism),</b> inadequate stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland (secondary <b>hypothyroidism),</b> or inadequate release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the brain's hypothalamus (tertiary <b>hypothyroidism).</b> Primary <b>hypothyroidism</b> is about a thousandfold more common than central <b>hypothyroidism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most <b>hypothyroidism</b> is {{primary in}} nature. Central/secondary <b>hypothyroidism</b> affects 1:20,000 to 1:80,000 of the population, or about {{one out of}} every {{thousand}} people with <b>hypothyroidism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Subclinical <b>hypothyroidism</b> is a milder form of <b>hypothyroidism</b> {{characterized}} by an elevated serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. This milder form of <b>hypothyroidism</b> is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In adults it is diagnosed when TSH levels are greater than 5 mIU/L and less than 10mIU/L. The presentation of subclinical <b>hypothyroidism</b> is variable and classic {{signs and symptoms of}} <b>hypothyroidism</b> may not be observed. Of people with subclinical <b>hypothyroidism,</b> a proportion will develop overt <b>hypothyroidism</b> each year. In those with detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO), this occurs in 4.3%, while in those with no detectable antibodies, this occurs in 2.6%. Those with subclinical <b>hypothyroidism</b> and detectable anti-TPO antibodies who do not require treatment should have repeat thyroid function tests more frequently (e.g. yearly) compared with those who do not have antibodies.|$|E
5|$|Women {{are more}} likely to develop <b>hypothyroidism</b> than men. In {{population-based}} studies, women were seven times {{more likely than men to}} have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical <b>hypothyroidism</b> will progress to overt <b>hypothyroidism</b> each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical <b>hypothyroidism</b> is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical <b>hypothyroidism</b> is more common in the elderly, and in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is <b>hypothyroidism,</b> in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{about one}} billion people are {{estimated}} to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in <b>hypothyroidism.</b> In large population-based studies in Western countries with sufficient dietary iodine, 0.3–0.4% of the population have overt <b>hypothyroidism.</b> A larger proportion, 4.3–8.5%, have subclinical <b>hypothyroidism.</b> Of people with subclinical <b>hypothyroidism,</b> 80% have a TSH level below the 10mIU/l mark regarded as the threshold for treatment. Children with subclinical <b>hypothyroidism</b> often return to normal thyroid function, and a small proportion develops overt <b>hypothyroidism</b> (as predicted by evolving antibody and TSH levels, the presence of celiac disease, and the presence of a goiter).|$|E
5|$|Even mild or {{subclinical}} <b>hypothyroidism</b> {{leads to}} possible infertility and {{increased risk of}} miscarriage. <b>Hypothyroidism</b> in early pregnancy, even with limited or no symptoms, may {{increase the risk of}} pre-eclampsia, offspring with lower intelligence, and the risk of infant death around the time of birth. Women are affected by <b>hypothyroidism</b> in 0.3–0.5% of pregnancies. Subclinical <b>hypothyroidism</b> during pregnancy has also been associated with gestational diabetes and birth of the baby before 37 weeks of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Infants with {{thyroid hormone}} {{deficiency}} (congenital <b>hypothyroidism)</b> can manifest problems of physical {{growth and development}} as well as brain development, termed cretinism. Children with congenital <b>hypothyroidism</b> are treated supplementally with levothyroxine, which facilitates normal growth and development.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cases of}} <b>hypothyroidism</b> are {{associated}} with mild elevations in creatine kinase and liver enzymes in the blood. They typically return to normal when <b>hypothyroidism</b> has been fully treated. Levels of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and lipoprotein (a) can be elevated; the impact of subclinical <b>hypothyroidism</b> on lipid parameters is less well-defined.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} <b>hypothyroidism</b> {{symptoms}} and confirmed thyroxine deficiency {{are treated with}} a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (L-thyroxine). In young and otherwise healthy people with overt <b>hypothyroidism,</b> a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in the elderly and people with heart disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications. Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical <b>hypothyroidism,</b> while people with central <b>hypothyroidism</b> may require a higher than average dose.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{is a rare}} but {{life-threatening}} {{state of}} extreme <b>hypothyroidism.</b> It may occur in those who {{are known to have}} <b>hypothyroidism</b> when they develop another illness, but it can be the first presentation of <b>hypothyroidism.</b> The illness is characterized by very low body temperature without shivering, confusion, a slow heart rate and reduced breathing effort. There may be physical signs suggestive of <b>hypothyroidism,</b> such as skin changes or enlargement of the tongue.|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in <b>hypothyroidism.</b> Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} common cause of <b>hypothyroidism</b> worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of <b>hypothyroidism</b> can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hypothyroidism</b> {{is managed}} with {{replacement}} of the hormone thyroxine. This is usually given daily as an oral supplement, and may take {{a few weeks to}} become effective. Some causes of <b>hypothyroidism,</b> such as Postpartum thyroiditis and Subacute thyroiditis may be transient and pass over time, and other causes such as iodine deficiency may be able to be rectified with dietary supplementation.|$|E
5|$|In overt primary <b>hypothyroidism,</b> TSH {{levels are}} high and T4 and T3 levels are low. Overt <b>hypothyroidism</b> may also be {{diagnosed}} in {{those who have a}} TSH on multiple occasions of greater than 5mIU/L, appropriate symptoms, and only a borderline low T4. It may also be diagnosed in those with a TSH of greater than 10mIU/L.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation of {{the thyroid}} is called thyroiditis. Inflamed thyroids may cause {{symptoms}} of hyperthyroidism or <b>hypothyroidism.</b> Two types thyroiditis initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes {{followed by a}} period of <b>hypothyroidism</b> – Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis. There are other disorders that cause inflammation of the thyroid, and these include subacute thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, Riedel's thyroiditis and traumatic injury, including palpation thyroiditis.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated <b>hypothyroidism</b> usually {{requires}} {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with <b>hypothyroidism).</b> Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the <b>hypothyroidism,</b> levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species that}} are less {{commonly}} affected include cats and horses, {{as well as other}} large domestic animals. In cats, <b>hypothyroidism</b> is usually the result of other medical treatment such as surgery or radiation. In young horses, congenital <b>hypothyroidism</b> has been reported predominantly in Western Canada and has been linked with the mother's diet.|$|E
5|$|People with <b>hypothyroidism</b> {{often have}} no or only mild {{symptoms}}. Numerous symptoms and signs {{are associated with}} <b>hypothyroidism,</b> and {{can be related to}} the underlying cause, or a direct effect of having not enough thyroid hormones. Hashimoto's thyroiditis may present with the mass effect of a goiter (enlarged thyroid gland).|$|E
5|$|Prevention at the {{population}} level {{has been with}} the universal salt iodization. <b>Hypothyroidism</b> can be treated with levothyroxine. The dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels. Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy. While a certain amount of dietary iodine is important, excessive amounts can worsen certain types of <b>hypothyroidism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Screening for <b>hypothyroidism</b> is {{performed}} in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH. This {{has led to the}} early identification of many cases and thus the prevention of developmental delay. It is the most widely used newborn screening test worldwide. While TSH-based screening will identify the most common causes, the addition of T4 testing is required to pick up the rarer central causes of neonatal <b>hypothyroidism.</b> If T4 determination is included in the screening done at birth, this will identify cases of congenital <b>hypothyroidism</b> of central origin in 1:16,000 to 1:160,000 children. Considering that these children usually have other pituitary hormone deficiencies, early identification of these cases may prevent complications.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid may be {{affected}} by several diseases. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, {{the most common cause}} being Graves' disease — an autoimmune disorder. In contrast, <b>hypothyroidism</b> is a state of insufficient thyroid hormone production. Worldwide, the most common cause is iodine deficiency. Thyroid hormones are important for development, and <b>hypothyroidism</b> secondary to iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability. In iodine-sufficient regions, {{the most common cause of}} <b>hypothyroidism</b> is Hashimoto's thyroiditis—also an autoimmune disease. In addition, the thyroid gland may also develop several types of nodules and cancer.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} <b>hypothyroidism</b> (lack of production of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the thyroid). Typical symptoms are tiredness, intolerance to cold, constipation, weight gain, hair loss and slowed thinking, {{as well as}} a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure. In children, <b>hypothyroidism</b> leads to delayed growth and in extreme inborn forms to a syndrome called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|Women with anti-TPO {{antibodies}} who {{are trying}} to become pregnant (naturally or by assisted means) may require thyroid hormone supplementation even if the TSH level is normal. This is particularly true if they have had previous miscarriages or have been hypothyroid in the past. Supplementary levothyroxine may reduce the risk of preterm birth and possibly miscarriage. The recommendation is stronger in pregnant women with subclinical <b>hypothyroidism</b> (defined as TSH 2.5–10mIU/l) who are anti-TPO positive, in view of the risk of overt <b>hypothyroidism.</b> If a decision is made not to treat, close monitoring of the thyroid function (every 4 weeks in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy) is recommended. If anti-TPO is not positive, treatment for subclinical <b>hypothyroidism</b> is not currently recommended. It has been suggested that many of the aforementioned recommendations could lead to unnecessary treatment, {{in the sense that the}} TSH cutoff levels may be too restrictive in some ethnic groups; there may be little benefit from treatment of subclinical <b>hypothyroidism</b> in certain cases.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, {{too little}} iodine {{in the diet}} {{is the most common}} cause of <b>hypothyroidism.</b> In {{countries}} with enough iodine in the diet, {{the most common cause of}} <b>hypothyroidism</b> is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of <b>hypothyroidism,</b> when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common clinically significant congenital disorder of the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of <b>hypothyroidism</b> as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect <b>hypothyroidism</b> in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E
5|$|Aberrations in {{prenatal}} {{development can}} result in various forms of thyroid dysgenesis which can cause congenital <b>hypothyroidism,</b> and if untreated {{this can lead to}} cretinism.|$|E
5|$|Delayed {{relaxation}} after {{testing the}} ankle jerk reflex is a characteristic sign of <b>hypothyroidism</b> and {{is associated with}} the severity of the hormone deficit.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hypothyroidism,</b> {{also called}} underactive thyroid or low thyroid, {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the endocrine {{system in which the}} thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated <b>hypothyroidism</b> during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|If the TSH {{level is}} normal or low and serum free T4 levels are low, this is suggestive of central <b>hypothyroidism</b> (not enough TSH or TRH {{secretion}} by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus). There {{may be other}} features of hypopituitarism, such as menstrual cycle abnormalities and adrenal insufficiency. There might also be symptoms of a pituitary mass such as headaches and vision changes. Central <b>hypothyroidism</b> should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
5|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, {{dogs are}} the species most commonly affected by <b>hypothyroidism.</b> The {{majority of cases}} occur {{as a result of}} primary <b>hypothyroidism,</b> of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. There is often lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with <b>hypothyroidism,</b> {{as well as a number}} of other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable antibodies against thyroglobulin, although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common cause of primary <b>hypothyroidism</b> and endemic goiter worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, <b>hypothyroidism</b> is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E
5|$|Metformin {{has also}} been {{reported}} to decrease the blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone in people with <b>hypothyroidism.</b> The significance of this is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hypothyroidism</b> may be {{prevented}} {{in a population}} by adding iodine to commonly used foods. This public health measure has eliminated endemic childhood <b>hypothyroidism</b> in countries where it was once common. In addition to promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods such as dairy and fish, many countries with moderate iodine deficiency have implemented universal salt iodization (USI). Encouraged by the World Health Organization, 130 countries now have USI, and 70% of the world's population are receiving iodized salt. In some countries, iodized salt is added to bread. Despite this, iodine deficiency has reappeared in some Western countries {{as a result of}} attempts to reduce salt intake.|$|E
5|$|Pregnancy {{leads to}} marked changes in thyroid hormone physiology. The gland is {{increased}} in size by 10%, thyroxine production is increased by 50%, and iodine requirements are increased. Many women have normal thyroid function but have immunological evidence of thyroid autoimmunity (as evidenced by autoantibodies) or are iodine deficient, and develop evidence of <b>hypothyroidism</b> {{before or after}} giving birth.|$|E
5|$|Some Giant Schnauzers develop central {{diabetes}} insipidus, {{autosomal recessive}} <b>hypothyroidism,</b> selective malabsorption of cobalamin, narcolepsy, cataplexy, and various seizure disorders. Some are also sensitive to sulphonamides and gold. Bone diseases and joint problems are also an issue. The most common {{causes of death}} in Giant Schnauzers are lymphoma and liver cancer, followed by heart attacks and heart failure.|$|E
5|$|Very severe <b>hypothyroidism</b> and myxedema coma are {{characteristically}} {{associated with}} low sodium {{levels in the}} blood together with elevations in antidiuretic hormone, as well as acute worsening of kidney function due {{to a number of}} causes.|$|E
5|$|Very severe <b>hypothyroidism</b> and myxedema coma are rare, with it {{estimated}} {{to occur in}} 0.22 per million people a year. The majority of cases occur in women over 60 years of age, although it may happen in all age groups.|$|E
