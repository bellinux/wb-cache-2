5|$|Clam <b>dip</b> is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a <b>dip</b> for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel.

40|$|Abstract. We report {{spectral}} fitting {{results for}} Rosat PSPC {{observations of the}} <b>dipping</b> source X 1755 - 338.

Remarkably, the low energy cutoff of the spectrum does not change appreciably in <b>dips,</b> and {{it can be seen that}} <b>dipping</b> takes place in the higher part of the PSPC band where the blackbody contributes to the spectrum. Thus <b>dipping</b> consists primarily of absorption of this component, whereas the low energy cut-off is determined by the power law. Thus, above 0. 5 keV, the <b>dipping</b> is approximately independent of energy as seen in Exosat and 10 ± 0. 4 % deep. Below 0. 5 keV, there may be a small residual <b>dipping</b> effect of up to 3 %; however <b>dipping</b> is certainly substantially reduced compared with the 20 % seen by Exosat, and this is the first time that the effective cessation of <b>dipping</b> at low energies in such sources has been seen...|$|R
