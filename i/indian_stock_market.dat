40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> returns and volatility in the <b>Indian</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> using AR(1) -EGARCH(p, q) -in-Mean model. The study considers daily closing prices of two major indexes of <b>Indian</b> <b>stock</b> exchanges, viz., S&P CNX NIFTY and the BSE-SENSEX of National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), respectively for the period from July 1, 1997 to December 31, 2013. The empirical results show positive but insignificant relationship between stock returns and conditional variance {{in the case of}} NSE Nifty and BSE SENSEX <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> Besides, the analysis reveals that volatility is persistent and there exists leverage effect supporting the work of Nelson (1991) in the <b>Indian</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> The present study suggests that the capital market regulators, investors and market participants should employ the asymmetric GARCH-type model that sufficiently captures the stylized characteristics of the return, such as time varying volatility, high persistence and asymmetric volatility responses, in determining the hedging strategy and portfolio management and estimating and forecasting volatility for risk management decision making at <b>Indian</b> <b>Stock</b> Exchange. ...|$|R

Detection of outliers in time series data has gained much attention in recent years. We present a new approach based on clustering techniques for outlier.

Regression based outlier technique is used to detect influence point. The analysis of outliers and influential points {{is an important step}} of the regression diagnostics. Several indicators are used for identifying and analyzing outliers. The proposed approach gave effective results within optimum time and space when applied to synthetic data set.
