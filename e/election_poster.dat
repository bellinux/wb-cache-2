500|$|In 1930, the German press {{described}} the Nefertiti bust as their new monarch, personifying it as a queen. As the [...] "'most precious... {{stone in the}} setting of the diadem' from the art treasures of 'Prussia Germany'", Nefertiti would re-establish the imperial German national identity after 1918. Hitler {{described the}} bust as [...] "a unique masterpiece, an ornament, a true treasure", and pledged to build a museum to house it. By the 1970s, the bust had become an issue of national identity to both German states—East Germany and West Germany—created after World War II. In 1999, Nefertiti appeared on an <b>election</b> <b>poster</b> for the green political party Bündnis 90/Die Grünen as a promise for cosmopolitan and multi-cultural environment with the slogan [...] "Strong Women for Berlin!" [...] According to Claudia Breger, another reason that the Nefertiti bust became associated with a German national identity was its place as a rival to the Tutankhamun find by the British, who then ruled Egypt.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, 22-year-old Polish graphic {{designer}} Tomasz Sarnecki transformed Marian Stachurski's 1959 Polish {{variant of the}} High Noon poster into a Solidarity <b>election</b> <b>poster</b> for the first partially free elections in communist Poland. The poster, which was displayed all over Poland, shows Cooper armed with a folded ballot saying [...] "Wybory" [...] (i.e., elections) {{in his right hand}} while the Solidarity logo is pinned to his vest above the sheriff's badge. The message {{at the bottom of the}} poster reads: [...] "W samo południe: 4 czerwca 1989," [...] which translates to [...] "High Noon: 4 June 1989." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Marge takes Homer to {{the wall}} of fame for the second time, Homer says, [...] "Is that why you brought me here, spirits?", a {{reference}} to Charles Dickens' novel A Christmas Carol. In the class presidential election at least one vote is shown to have been cast for Fonzie, a character from the sitcom Happy Days, while Homer fails to understand that Bruce Wayne is the true identity of the superhero Batman. Additionally, Homer's <b>election</b> <b>poster</b> claims he is endorsed by the films Star Wars and Jaws and sees him hugging Darth Vader and the shark respectively from each. During the episode's couch gag, the Simpsons chase the couch through the streets of San Francisco, mirroring the car chase in the 1968 film Bullitt.|$|E
