500|$|A year later, Moore {{still did}} not {{understand}} the controversy that caused photos of a naked, pregnant woman to be viewed as morally objectionable. Moore stated that, [...] "I did feel glamorous, beautiful and more free about my body. I don't know how much more family oriented <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> have gotten." [...] She considered the cover to be a healthy [...] "feminist statement." [...] In 2007, Moore stated that the picture was not originally intended for publication. [...] She had posed in a personal photo session, not a cover shoot. [...] Leibovitz has had personal photo sessions of Moore and all of her daughters.|$|E
500|$|... "Ben Franklin" [...] {{received}} mixed, {{but mostly}} good, reviews from critics. IGN's Brian Zoromski wrote that [...] "The Office [...] was in truly excellent form this week." [...] Zoromski {{went on to}} credit the [...] "great progression" [...] in the Jim-Pam-Karen love triangle and Michael being [...] "his completely inept self" [...] as parts of the episode that made it [...] "one of the best Office episodes this season". Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad was less enthusiastic about the episode, writing that although it was [...] "solid", [...] "not much happened here other than the Jim-Karen-Pam triangle." [...] Abby West, of Entertainment Weekly, praised the love triangle, saying [...] "The Pam/Karen confrontation was as uncomfortable as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> hope for. It's so gratifying to see Pam's armor cracking." [...] West also praised {{the work of the}} supporting cast.|$|E
500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I {{would like to say}} something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked by}} the BBC whether she was {{concerned}} that her work might be manipulated for political gain, she replied: [...] "Of course I worry, but all the work I've ever done, both medically and in the reviews I've done for government - and I think they know this - have [...] been as evidence-based as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> make them".|$|E
2500|$|... "I had my {{attorneys}} {{tell me that}} I {{was crazy}} because I wasn't buying anything. I was paying $2million and they were saying 'What are you getting? Lorenzo Fertitta revealed to Fighter's Only magazine, recalling the lack of assets he acquired in the purchase. [...] "And I said 'What you don't understand is I'm getting the most valuable thing that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> have, which is those three letters: UFC. That is what's {{going to make this}} thing work. Everybody knows that brand, whether they like it or they don't like it, they react to it.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a scathing}} review, Billy Hamilton of Under the Radar critiques the poptimism {{narrative}} surrounding Jepsen and her perceived effort to appease [...] "indie tastemakers", regarding her as [...] "the pet project of a creative hipsterati that's determined to prove pop is cooler than you, or <b>I,</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> ever imagine," [...] further expressing that [...] "Carly Rae Jepsen and her production team try overly {{hard to be}} clever." [...] In a similar conclusion, Evan Sawdey of PopMatters writes that [...] "Emotion {{is still a very}} pleasing album if not just a shade overambitious, clearly trying too hard to make the same genius pop moments that Kiss churned them out with effortless flair." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 1990 Hepburn went to Vietnam, in {{an effort}} to {{collaborate}} with the government for national UNICEF-supported immunisation and clean water programmes. In September 1992, four months before she died, Hepburn went to Somalia. Calling it [...] "apocalyptic", she said, [...] "I walked into a nightmare. I have seen famine in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, but I have seen nothing like this â€“ so much worse than <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> have imagined. I wasn't prepared for this." [...] Though scarred by what she had seen, Hepburn still had hope. [...] "Taking care of children {{has nothing to do with}} politics. I think perhaps with time, instead of there being a politicisation of humanitarian aid, there will be a humanisation of politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sobers went on {{his first}} {{overseas}} tour {{in the early months}} of 1956 when, aged 19, {{he was part of the}} West Indian tour of New Zealand. The series was not successful personally for Sobers, who struggled on the foreign batting wickets. West Indies pitches had little or no grass to speak of, while in New Zealand the pitches were green. [...] "I took one look and asked myself how <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> bat on that? How could I make runs? I was out before I even walked to the crease," [...] Sobers later wrote. Playing in all four Tests, he totalled 81 runs and two wickets. As a batsman, Sobers needed time to develop at Test level and, in nine Tests as a teenager, he scored only one half century, and averaged 29.33 with the bat.|$|E
2500|$|Ali was not {{originally}} {{a member of}} the Democratic party but changed parties after listening to Representative Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). Ali was [...] "so enamored of Van Hollen's foreign policy positions that he changed his party affiliation from Green to Democratic." [...] Ali soon became [...] "the first elected President of the District 39 Democratic Club". Ali's political activity first gained media attention when he [...] "was the Legislative District 39 Coordinator for the Howard Dean presidential campaign in 2003 and early 2004." [...] After Dean failed to win the primary, Ali supported the John Kerry and John Edwards presidential ticket. During that election season, Ali became a full-time campaign volunteer for Rep. Chris Van Hollen, because of Van Hollen's foreign policy positions and his stance on the Iraq War. During Van Hollen's 2004 reelection campaign, Ali said [...] "I'm really motivated against this war and have never felt so animated before. I thought, 'What is the most head-turning thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> do?'" [...] and he [...] "bought 500 bumper stickers at a buck apiece and applied more than 400 to the car". It was noted that the family's other car was kept [...] "very pristine" [...] as [...] "That's the one his wife drives." [...] Later that year he was Co-Chair of the Montgomery County Democratic Spring Ball. Also in 2004, Ali, {{a member of the}} Montgomery County Muslim Council, helped plan [...] "the first Muslim-Jewish Day of Friendship" [...] with [...] "congregations Temple Shalom in Chevy Chase, Adat Shalom in Bethesda, Bethesda Jewish Congregation and Fabrangen Cheder" [...] to [...] "clean up a historic Underground Railroad stop in Germantown". Ali hoped the event would [...] "allow people to start lasting friendships and show the ability of these groups to come together for a common good." [...] In 2005, Ali's political activities expanded when he helped form the [...] "Longdraft Road Coalition", an organization opposing the expansion of this [...] "quiet, residential two-lane road to a bustling four-lane byway." [...] Ali became [...] "co-chairman of the 180-person plus group" [...] whose efforts were largely viewed as successful. In September 2005, Ali also co-organized [...] "The 2nd annual Montgomery County Muslim-Jewish Day of Friendship". In 2005, Ali was a campaign supporter of Jun Choi, the Democratic candidate for Mayor of Edison, New Jersey, which Choi won.|$|E

60|$|Then, {{for lack}} of breath, ensued a silence, at the deepest point of which, tickled by the oddity of {{surprising}} my grave associates in this masquerading trim, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>possibly</b> refrain from a burst of laughter on my own separate account.|$|R

6000|$|Astonishment, dismay, {{and anger}} held me dumb between {{them for a}} few moments. Then, as the power of speech returned, I said: [...] "Confound you, Mackay! You don't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> have had any hand in that?" ...|$|E
