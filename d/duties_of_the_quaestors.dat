50|$|To {{enable the}} Prefect to {{exercise}} his authority, the cohortes urbanae, Rome’s police force, and the nightwatchmen (vigiles) under their prefect (praefectus vigilum), were placed under his command. The Prefect also had <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> publishing <b>the</b> laws promulgated by the Emperor, {{and as such}} acquired a legal jurisdiction. This extended to legal cases between slaves and their masters, patrons and their freedmen, and over sons who had violated the pietas towards their parents. Gradually, <b>the</b> judicial powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prefect expanded, as the Prefect's office began to re-assume its old powers from the praetor urbanus. Eventually there was no appeal from the Prefect’s sentencing, except to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Emperor, unlike <b>the</b> sentencing <b>of</b> other officials. Even <b>the</b> governors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman provinces were subject to the Prefect’s jurisdiction. The Prefect also possessed judicial powers over criminal matters. Originally these powers were exercised in conjunction with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quaestors,</b> but by <b>the</b> 3rd century, they were exercised alone.|$|R
50|$|In 420 BC, Medullinus {{was elected}} {{consular}} tribune {{for the third}} time, once again with Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus and Aulus Sempronius Aratinus, and with a new colleague, Marcus Manlius Vulso, all patricians. <b>The</b> election <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quaestors</b> was conducted and overseen by Aulus Sempronius Atratinus who had opened the election to patrician candidates, which provoked <b>the</b> anger <b>of</b> tribunes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plebs Aulus Antistius, Sextus Pompilius, and Marcus Canuleius. They moved to punish Gaius Sempronius Atratinus (consul in 423 BC), <b>the</b> cousin <b>of</b> Aulus Sempronius Atratinus, for his conduct <b>of</b> <b>the</b> election for <b>quaestors.</b> <b>The</b> tribunes reproached Sempronius with the errors committed during {{the war against the}} Volsci at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> his consulship and made him pay amends with a fine of 15,000 asses.|$|R
25|$|In 370, several {{senators}} {{were tried}} for alleged magic practices by prefect Maximinus; Praetextatus led a senatorial legation to emperor Valentinian I, including Volusius Venustus and Minervius, {{which had the}} task to ask Valentinian to avoid torture for those senators involved in trials; <b>the</b> three <b>of</b> them were allowed at <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emperor, who denied having given such a disposition, but, thanks to <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quaestor</b> Eupraxius, <b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> senators were restored.|$|R
25|$|As {{part of his}} reforms, in 539 Emperor Justinian I created another office named {{quaestor}} {{or alternatively}} quaesitor (Greek: κυαισίτωρ) who was given police and judicial powers in Constantinople, and also tasked with <b>the</b> supervision <b>of</b> new arrivals to the imperial capital. By <b>the</b> turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 9th century, <b>the</b> original <b>quaestor</b> had lost most <b>of</b> his former <b>duties</b> to other officials, chiefly the logothetēs tou dromou and the epi tōn deēseōn. <b>The</b> functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle Byzantine <b>quaestor</b> were essentially those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quaesitor: he was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kritai ("judges") <b>of</b> Constantinople. However, as John B. Bury notes, an examination of his subordinate staff, {{and the fact that}} it could be held by a eunuch, shows that the later office was <b>the</b> direct continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quaestor</b> sacri palatii.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> office <b>of</b> <b>quaestor</b> was {{considered}} <b>the</b> lowest-ranking <b>of</b> all major political offices.

Magistrates often chose which quaestor accompanied them abroad, and these quaestors often functioned as personal secretaries responsible for <b>the</b> allocation <b>of</b> money, including army pay. Urban quaestors had several important responsibilities, such as <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public treasury, (the aerarium Saturni) where they monitored all items going into, and coming out <b>of,</b> <b>the</b> treasury. In addition, they often spoke publicly about the balances available in <b>the</b> treasury. <b>The</b> <b>quaestors</b> could only issue public money for a particular purpose if they were authorized {{to do so by}} <b>the</b> senate. <b>The</b> <b>quaestors</b> were assisted by scribes, who handled the actual accounting for the treasury. The treasury was a repository for documents, as well as for money. <b>The</b> texts <b>of</b> enacted statutes and decrees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Senate were deposited in the treasury under <b>the</b> supervision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quaestors.</b>|$|R

50|$|Territorially, the quaestura exercitus {{contained}} <b>the</b> Roman provinces <b>of</b> Moesia Inferior and Scythia Minor, {{located in}} the lower Danube region, as well as <b>the</b> provinces <b>of</b> Cyprus, Caria, and the Aegean Islands (i.e. <b>the</b> Cyclades). All <b>of</b> these provinces were detached from <b>the</b> Praetorian prefecture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East and placed under <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> a new army official known as <b>the</b> <b>quaestor</b> exercitus ("Quaestor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army"). <b>The</b> authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quaestor</b> was <b>the</b> equivalent {{to that of a}} magister militum. Since the strategically vital Danubian provinces were economically impoverished, <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quaestura exercitus was to help support the troops that were stationed there. By connecting the lower Danubian provinces with wealthier provinces, Justinian was able to transport supplies via the Black Sea.
