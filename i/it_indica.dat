30|$|Two other CMS types {{have the}} {{potential}} to be utilized in hybrid rice production. LD-CMS was obtained by Watanabe et al. ([1968]) by performing a backcross of the japonica variety Fujisaka 5 to the Burmese rice cultivar ‘Lead Rice’, giving <b>it</b> <b>indica</b> cytoplasm and a japonica nucleus (Figure  1). The pollen grains of LD-CMS can be slightly stained with I 2 -KI, but they cannot germinate on stigmas (Figure  1). The other CMS type is CW-CMS, which has the cytoplasm of O. rufipogon and a japonica nucleus. It produces morphologically normal pollen grains that can be stained darkly with I 2 -KI but lacks the ability to germinate (Figure  1; Fujii and Toriyama [2005]). Both LD-CMS and CW-CMS are gametophytically controlled and hence half of the pollen grains of F 1 plants are viable (Figure  1).|$|E

The most studied component is the terpenoid azadirachtin which is used for its insecticidal and putative antimicrobial properties.

We show that the semi-purified fractions have moderate to strong cytotoxicity. However, this is not attributable to azadirachtin but to other active compounds present in the mixture. Each fraction was further purified by appropriate extraction procedures and we observed a differential cytotoxicity in the various sub-fractions. This led us to investigate the mode of cell death. After treatment with the oil fractions we observed positivity to TUNEL staining and extensive internucleosomal DNA degradation both indicating apoptotic death. The anti-proliferative properties of the neem oil-derived compounds were also assayed by evaluation of the nuclear PCNA levels (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen). PCNA is significantly reduced in cells treated with a specific fraction of neem oil.

30|$|All biofungicides {{effectively}} managed {{disease by}} improving growth and physiological attributes in cowpea plants. Soil incorporation with T. harzianum proved more effective {{as compared to}} T. viride and dry leaf biomass of A. indica. In either case, combined application of Trichoderma spp. with leaf biomass showed a better effect on cowpea as compared to either biofungicides given alone. However, T. harzianum in combination with dry leaf biomass of A. indica showed the maximum disease management and improvement in plant growth. Lower level of disease incidence and improvement in plant growth attributes after incorporation of soil amendments {{could be due to}} their antifungal action that could be further ascribed to enhancement in host resistance, induction of a hypersensitive response through inhibiting growth of M. phaseolina, and conservation of root system function (Vinale et al. 2008). As the Trichoderma species exhibit the ability to grow fast and produce large spore that would be another factor behind the disease suppression as Trichoderma can uptake nutrients more efficiently as compared to a pathogen (Vinale et al. 2008). Besides improvement in soil texture, soil physicochemical properties with better aeration may provide a more suitable environment for the beneficial microbes as compared to the pathogen. The net results of soil amendments seemed to improve plant physiology ultimately resulting in better plant health. Likewise, allelochemicals effect induced by leaves biomass of A. indica might have antagonist effect on the pathogen.

East Nile Locality {{was selected as the}} study area and several parts were surveyed: Ailafoon, Elhaj Yousif, Umdawanban, Kutrang and Keriab. Sampling was done in the three chosen categories namely forest, residential and farms. In each sample, trees and/ or shrubs were identified and enumerated; ten trees were randomly selected for each of the dominant tree species for determining crown projection as a measure of tree cover. The main variables presented were: Tree species, Tree density, Crown projection and Frequency. In the residential sites, square sample plots with an area of approximately 0. 1 ha were used. Altogether 150 sample plots were laid down at the following locations: Ailafoon, Elhaj Yousif, Umdawanban, Kutrang and Keriab villages. The study showed the following species as most frequent: Acacia tortilis subspp tortilis, Accia tortilis sub-species radiana, Acacia ehrenbergiana, Azadirachta indica, Albizia lebbeck and Phoenix dactylifera. Acacia tortilis subspecies tortilis were more common in forest sites, while Azadirachta indica was more common in the residential areas. Overall, 53 tree and shrub species were encountered. The number of species in the residential areas was far greeter than in the forest areas, because they included a lot of horticulture and ornamental species. Density of trees ranged between 54 and 427 per ha in forest sites ie 189 ± 3 which is very low. IV In forest sites, the highest species density was shown by Acacia tortilis subsp tortilis.

We collected DNA sequences covering the target region of three cultivars, Nipponbare, 93 - 11, and Guangluai 4. The Nipponbare chromosome 4 was sequenced completely (Feng et al. 2002). 93 - 11 is a parental cultivar of a superhybrid rice grown in China.

Guangluai 4 belongs to <b>Indica.</b> <b>Its</b> 2.3  Mb of three contiguous segments of chromosome 4 was sequenced (Feng et al. 2002). We also selected a Kasalath BAC clone K 0211 H 09 covering the HWC 2 region by BLAST searching for BAC end sequences ([URL] Katagiri et al. 2004). Shotgun sequencing was performed for the clone. We have already constructed a BAC library of Jamaica, which consists of 19, 282 clones with average insert size of 104  kb, to clone HWC 1 gene from Jamaica. From the BAC library, we selected three Jamaica BAC clones covering the HWC 2 region by PCR screening using the most tightly linked DNA markers of HWC 2 at that point using three-dimensional BAC pools as template DNA. Shotgun sequencing was performed also for these clones. The sequences of Kasalath and Jamaica consisted of several contigs and were therefore incomplete, but they provided sufficient information {{for the development of}} new DNA markers. The complete sequences of the two cultivars covering the HWC 2 region will be published elsewhere in the near future. We made alignments of the sequences of the five cultivars using DNAsis Pro (Hitachi Software Engineering Co. Ltd.) and detected substitutions and insertion/deletion (indels). We tried to produce STS markers by designing primers encompassing indels using Primer 3 (Rozen and Skaletsky 2000) if the indel size was longer than three bases. Regarding substitutions and indels shorter than four bases, we searched for restriction enzyme recognition sites along the polymorphic sequences with DNAsis Pro. We tried to produce CAPS markers by designing primers encompassing restriction enzyme recognition sites using Primer 3 if restriction enzyme recognition sites were present. Otherwise, we tried to make dCAPS markers by designing dCAPS primers including necessary mismatches using dCAPS finder 2.0 (Neff et al. 2002) and reverse primers using Primer 3.|$|R
