50|$|Once {{plenty of}} {{mushrooms}} have been grown and safely packed-away for pick-up the player {{can send a}} message to Earth to have a spaceship sent en route to the colony to pick up. The player can also order supplies (extra seeds, <b>fencing,</b> <b>panels</b> and other useful items) for the ship to deliver. The game provides an ETA for the ship which the player must keep an eye on. The ship requires the colony's landing beacon to be on when it arrives. If the beacon is on then the ship will land at the landing-bay (the player must not be on this screen at the time or the droid will be crushed!), drop off its crates of supplies there and pay for the mushrooms (the money can be used when next ordering supplies). If the beacon is not on, the ship will dump all the supplies at random in the surrounding desert and many of them will be lost to the aliens. The beacon drains the colony's power-supply quickly so it is important to only leave it on as long as necessary and also to ensure that the colony's power-storage is suitably high before activating it.|$|R
40|$|The Permian Rotliegend gas {{play of the}} UK Southern North Sea {{consists}} of aeolian sandstones that pass distally into evaporite-rich lacustrine claystones. Previous development of the southern North Sea Basin has focused on high-quality aeolian sandstones. However, as these are now maturing, focus has shifted to exploring the potential of more heterogeneous, marginal reservoirs (so-called “feather-edge ” play). Vertical and lateral heterogeneity within these marginal reservoirs poses a high risk to their successful development, {{as a result of}} low permeability stratigraphic units acting as potential barriers to flow. The well-exposed Page (aeolian/sabkha) and Cedar Mesa (aeolian/fluvial) sandstones in southern Utah are analogous to elements of the marginal Rotliegend play and have been studied at outcrop to investigate sedimentologic heterogeneity at reservoir and inter-well scales. Measured sections and <b>fence</b> <b>panels</b> from the outcrop analogs have enabled the lateral extent and connectivity of different sandbodies to be mapped in three dimensions. 3 D reservoir models of each outcrop analog have been constructed to create an accurate realization of facies architecture.

Simulation of dry gas production from the models provides improved understanding {{of the way in which}} heterogeneity affects fluid flow patterns, reservoir behaviour, and potential development of Rotliegend “feather-edge ” reservoirs...|$|R

60|$|In such {{a village}} as my colored brother drove me {{through on the}} way to the beach it was of an {{absolute}} fitness; and I wish I could convey a due sense of the exquisite keeping of the place. Each white house was more or less closely belted in with a white <b>fence,</b> of <b>panels</b> or pickets; the grassy door-yards glowed with flowers, and often a climbing rose embowered the door-way with its bloom. Away backward or sidewise stretched the woodshed from the dwelling to the barn, and shut the whole under one cover; the turf grew to the wheel-tracks of the road-way, over which the elms rose and drooped; and from one end of the village to the other you could not, as the saying is, find a stone to throw at a dog. I know Holland; I have seen the wives of Scheveningen scrubbing up for Sunday to the very middle of their brick streets, but I doubt if Dutch cleanliness goes so far without, or comes from so deep a scruple within, as the cleanliness of New England.

40|$|Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) {{represents}} around 16 % of {{the area}} of commercial conifer plantations in Great Britain, but around 30 % in north and north-eastern Scotland. Most of the timber produced from these forests goes into lower-value markets such as <b>fencing</b> and <b>panel</b> products, and only a small proportion is converted into high-value structural timber. In order to maximise financial returns from this resource in the medium and long term, {{it will be necessary}} to increase the outturn of structural timber. However, this requires knowledge of the variation in those wood properties that influence structural timber performance and of the effects of silviculture on wood quality. Changes in silvicultural practices in recent decades—wider initial spacings, a preference for artificial regeneration, and an increased use of mechanised thinnings, have led to concerns about the suitability of Scots pine timber for use in structural applications due to potentially poorer stem form, a greater proportion of juvenile wood and larger, more numerous knots. As part of the research presented here, novel predictive equations were developed for the key physical, mechanical and branching properties that determine structural timber quality in Scots pine, namely: microfibril angle, wood density, clearwood bending strength and stiffness, and branch number, size, insertion angle and status (alive or dead). Simulations were carried out using these equations to examine the effects of different silvicultural regimes on each wood and branch property of interest. Based on these simulations it is recommended that in order to produce high quality Scots pine timber, trees are planted at narrower initial spacings and grown on longer rotations than currently prescribed, and, where appropriate, thinnings should be delayed. Together, these measures will restrict final branch size and the amount of mechanically inferior juvenile wood in the final crop. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

5000|$|The beaverslide is {{constructed}} of a rigid pole frame {{in the form}} of a right-angle triangle that supports a steeply inclined, slatted, plank ramp, with or without sides, approximately 50 - 60 ft long. The size and angle of individual beaverslides varies greatly and reflects local needs. Beaverslides were originally of all-wooden construction, usually lodgepole pine, and could last 10 to 15 years. In the 1970s, some components began to be made of metal, which are longer-lasting. The inclined ramp, about 15 - 20 ft wide, is made of smooth wooden or metal slats and is about two thirds the length of the poles. In the 1920s it became possible to extend the height of the slide so that the hay could be thrown further. In the 1950s movable wings were placed on either side of the ramp so that the hay could be stacked more neatly. A flat, toothed wooden platform called a [...] "basket" [...] or rack is suspended by a system of cables and pulleys from the poles. It is raised to bring hay to the top of the slide, and then lowered back down along the length of the ramp. A backstop, usually an open wooden grid held up by poles, is set at the far end of the stack helps hold the completed stack in place. A <b>fence</b> of wood <b>panels</b> or other materials is often placed around the stack to keep out livestock.|$|R
