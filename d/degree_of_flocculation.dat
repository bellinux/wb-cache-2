40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{performance}} of polyacrylamide grafted cellulose flocculant derived from Pandan leaves to treat reactive black 5 (RB 5) dye from aqueous solution were investigated. Response surface methodology (RSM) and Box-Behnken design (BBD) of experiment {{were employed to}} identify the optimum condition for chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction in RB 5 dye. The optimization was based on three operating variables; initial dye concentration, flocculant dosage and pH. The optimum condition for COD reduction was achieved at initial dye concentration of 0. 03 g/l with flocculant dosage of 0. 06 g, at pH 11. 72. Under this condition, the reduction of COD was achieved up to 54. 24 %. Linear and quadratic effects of flocculant dosage and pH are the most significant in affecting the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> efficiency.

40|$|In {{this study}} on the surface charges and {{structural}} characterization of kaolinite clay, {{it is found that}} the highly pH dependent edge charges are important to the interparticle forces and associated fabric formations. When the pH is below the isoelectrical point of the edge surfaces, IEPedge, the Coulombian attraction between faces and edges dominates, which favors the formation of an opened edge-to-face (EF) association and a higher final sediment volume. At pH > IEPedge, the double-layer repulsion prevails at all surfaces to result in a deflocculated and dispersed fabric, which tends to form denser soil packing in the sediment. Increasing the ionic strength (with NaCl as the electrolyte) leads to the opposite behavior in clay suspensions below and above the IEPedge: the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> fabric <b>flocculation</b> and the final sediment volume decrease with an increased ionic strength at pH IEPedge. The measured pore-size distribution reveals a distinct dual-porosity characteristic in the pH 4 with salts (0. 15 mol/L NaCl) specimen: it consists of inter-aggregate spaces (similar to 1. 10 mu m) and intra-aggregate pores (similar to 0. 30 mu m). Soils with a higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> EF <b>flocculation</b> due to the prevailing Coulombian or van der Waals attraction can render a higher liquid limit...|$|R

40|$|By {{comparing}} the original particle gradation of sediment from the Three Gorges Reservoir {{with the single}} particle gradation, the differences in these two particle gradations showed that there is sediment flocculation in the Three Gorges Reservoir, which can accelerate the sediment deposition rate in the reservoir. In {{order to determine the}} influence <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> on the sediment settling velocity, sediment was collected at the Three Gorges Reservoir, and the indoor quiescent settling experiment was performed to study the mechanism <b>of</b> sediment <b>flocculation.</b> The experimental results showed that sediments aggregated from single particles into floccules in the settling processes.

40|$|Effects of {{hydrodynamic}} mixing intensity on {{the initial}} stage dynamics of bridging flocculation induced by adsorbing polyelectrolyte were analyzed {{as an extension of}} previous report on the effect of ionic strength (J. Coll. Int. Sci. 204 (1998) 328). Mixing condition were changed by adopting forked flask of varying depth, mounted on an end-over-end rotation apparatus. At low ionic strength, no significant influence due to the difference of mixing intensity was observed. Flocculation proceeded in a way consistent with the picture of kinetically-controlled polymer adsorption and ultimate <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> increased with increasing mixing intensity. At high ionic strength, a qualitatively different behavior of the progress of flocculation was found. At higher mixing intensity, flocculation started slowly, implying a flat conformation of the adsorbing polyelectrolyte in the beginning of adsorption. This result was interpreted as an immediate spreading of attached polyelectrolyte chains on the bare surface. However, a remarkable enhancement of the rate of flocculation sets in after a while. The point of this onset roughly corresponds to the half coverage of the surface. This is an indication of the formation of a thicker adsorption layer presumably caused by the fact that pre-adsorbed chains hamper the spreading of new comers in their neighborhood. These results mean that the rate of reconfirmation is a function of surface coverage. It was also confirmed that the ultimate <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> converged to a constant level independent of mixing intensity, implying a complete relaxation of the meta-stable state. These observations are explained in terms of the effect of salt on (i) polyelectrolyte conformation and (ii) strength of the ion pair bond between charged segments and charged groups on the particle surface...|$|E

The second method makes use of boundary liquid (such as water, oil, or polymer solution) which is injected at comparatively small flowrates into the pipe downstream from the pump to form a lubricating annulus adjacent to the pipe wall. The third method involves gas injection into the pipe downstream from the pump to form a slug flow pattern which results in substantial frictional pressure loss reductions for shear-thinning, non-Newtonian slurry, initially flowing in the laminar flow regime prior to gas injection. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{elucidates}} {{the relative}} importance of soil structure and various compositional factors in influencing the liquid limit of natural kaolinitic soils. Earlier studies dealt with purified systems and anticipated that the liquid limit of the soils would increase with percentage clay size fraction and surface area, and that soils with a greater <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> paricle <b>flocculation</b> would possess a higher liquid limit than soils with a more parallel particle arrangement. The results revealed that the inter-particle attraction and repulsion forces have a prominent role in determining the liquid limit of kaolinitic soils. These forces determine the particle arrangement (clay fabric) which in turn regulates the liquid limit values. The influence of clay fabric was ascertained from the relationships of liquid limit with shrinkage limit and sediment volume (in water) values. It was anticipated that kaolinitic soils with a greater <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> particle flocculatin and a higher liquid limit would shrink less and occupy a higher sedimentation volume. As expected an increase in liquid limit was accompanied by an increase in shrinkage limit and sediment volume in water...|$|R

At pH 3 – 5, anionic alginate adsorbed to the surfaces of β-Lg coated droplets due to electrostatic attraction. At pH 6 and 7 adsorption did not occur because of the strong electrostatic repulsion between the anionic alginate and anionic droplets. Emulsion droplets coated by β-Lg-alginate complexes were prone to bridging flocculation, which promoted creaming instability. However, high intensity ultrasound treatment was able to reduce the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> droplet <b>flocculation</b> in these emulsions, thereby increasing their creaming stability. These results suggest that stable emulsions containing droplets surrounded by β-Lg–alginate interfacial complexes can be produced (at pH 4 and 5) by using ultrasound treatment to disrupt any flocs formed when the polysaccharide and emulsion are mixed together.

This study evaluated physical, morphological and pedogenetic attributes related to water yield potential in small watersheds in Guarapari, ES, Brazil. The following representative profiles were selected, morphologically described and sampled in area of Atlantic Forest domain: Lithic Udifolists, Oxyaquic Udifluventes, Typic Paleudults, Typic Hapludults, Typic Hapludox, Oxic Dystrudepts and Typic Endoaquents. Samples were collected in the soil profiles for physical analysis. Measurements of field-saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil penetration resistance were perfomed in some profiles, which were under different uses. The Endoaquents of Limão Creek can be considered efficient as temporary water reservoirs. However, the use of artificial drainage tends to reduce this effect.

40|$|Dispersion of {{magnetic}} iron oxide powder, γ-Fe 2 O 3 in the mixture of toluene and cyclohexane was studied to decrease the viscosity of the slurry and prepare the stable slurry {{in the presence of}} some saturated fatty acids with a straight chain as dispersing agents. The dispersion of γ-Fe 2 O 3 is controlled by the steric hindrance of the dispersing agent adsorbed on it. Therefore, the viscosity and dispersion of the slurry significantly depend on the carbon number and the amount of the fatty acids. Since water content of γ-Fe 2 O 3 greatly influences the control of the viscosity and dispersion degree, low water content is required to get lower viscosity and more stable dispersed state.

40|$|Lithium ion {{batteries}} are the current technology {{of choice for}} electric vehicles due to their light weight, high volumetric and gravimetric energy density, low selfdischarge rate, quick charge acceptance, excellent cycle life and wide operating temperature range. However the current manufacturing process {{requires the use of}} polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), in order to bind the anode components within the electrode which prevents the recycling of the electrode materials. Furthermore PVDF necessitate the application of N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP), an environmentally toxic material as a solvent during the manufacturing. The aim of this research was to investigate the suitability of using water soluble Na-alginate as an alternative binder for the anodes of lithium ion batteries to reduce the environmental impact from current manufacturing processes and to allow recycling of the active anode components. The main function of the binder is the improvement of the mechanical strength and the adhesion of the electrode on the current collector. The properties of the binder which are most important during manufacturing are the rheological characteristics of the slurries comprising binder and active materials. This was the focus of this investigation. The viscosity of Na-alginate suspensions at 1 % or 1. 5 % loading in water were typically 1 to 8 Pa·s which are similar to PVDF suspensions with loadings of 2. 5 to 3. 0 %. Comparing to the benchmark Na-CMC, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> shows that for the same concentration of binder in water, Na-alginate suspensions are more stable, Na-alginate has a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> of 1. 17 while for Na-CMC it was 1. 90.

The system consists of a flat sheet membrane with air scouring operated at constant transmembrane pressure to assess the influence of pressure on resistance of fouling layers.

Tests on membrane bioreactor sludge showed high reproducibility.

40|$|Aims: To {{identify}} the nutrients that can trigger the loss <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> under growth conditions in an ale-brewing strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC 1195. Methods and Results: Flocculation was evaluated {{using the method}} of Soares, EX. and Vroman, A. [Journal of Applied Microbiology (2003) 95, 325]. Yeast growth with metabolizable carbon sources (glucose, fructose, galactose, maltose or sucrose) at 2 % (w/v), induced the loss <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> in yeast {{that had previously been}} allowed to flocculate. The yeast remained flocculent when transferred to a medium containing the required nutrients for yeast growth and a sole nonmetabolizable carbon source (lactose). Transfer of flocculent yeast into a growth medium with ethanol (4 % v/v), as the sole carbon source did not induce the loss <b>of</b> <b>flocculation.</b> Even the addition of glucose (2 % w/v) or glucose and antimycin A (0. 1 mg lˉ¹) to this culture did not bring about loss <b>of</b> <b>flocculation.</b> Cycloheximide addition (15 mglˉ¹) to glucose-growing cells stopped flocculation loss. Conclusions: Carbohydrates were the nutrients responsible for stimulating the loss <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> in flocculent yeast cells transferred to growing conditions.

At a low starch concentration (1. 5 %), the extent of coalescence was higher in the emulsions containing modified amylopectin starch than in those containing unmodified amylopectin starch. All emulsions containing moderate levels of unmodified or modified amylopectin starch showed flocculation of oil droplets by a depletion mechanism. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>flocculation,</b> which was dependent on the molecular weight and the radius of gyration of the amylopectin molecules, was considered to correlate with the extent of coales-cence of the oil droplets in these emulsions. At high levels of added starch (> 1. 5 %), the degree of coalescence decreased gradually, apparently {{because of the high}} viscosity of the aqueous phase...|$|E
40|$|Fresh {{activated}} sludge in many {{wastewater treatment plants}} may be considered unhealthy due to {{the large amount of}} organic and organism content. Due to the lack of research on municipal sludge, there is an apparent scarcity of actual data. Thus, this work will focus on the characterization of fresh {{activated sludge}}. The effect of dosage of different polyelectrolytes and coagulants has been investigated at pH level in a comparative fashion that is commonly associated with fresh activated sludge. The results indicated that the cationic polyelectrolytes had significant effluence on the sludge properties, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> and water quality. With respect to the optical analyses, it was observed that the floc sizes and densities were increased with rise concentrations of both types of cationic polyelectrolytes. It was found that the cationic CPAM- 80 was the most effective chemical among other six used chemicals especially for solutions with pH near neutrality despite of the variations in feed properties of the fresh activated sludge. This polyelectrolyte gave lower turbidity, lower sludge volume index, faster zone settling rate and large floc density...|$|E
40|$|Clay {{particles}} in suspension {{are surrounded by}} an electrical double layer, whose inner layer consists of OH -. There is a linear relation {{between the amount of}} OH - in this inner coat and the pH of the equilibrium solution. Consequently the charge on clay particles {{is a function of the}} pH of the equilibrium solution. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> depends mainly on the electrokinetic potential of the clay particles. Therefore differences in flocculation with several salts are closely related to valency and polarizability of the ions. Calculations from measurements of the capacity of the electrical double layer suggested a specific surface area of 500 m 2 per g of bentonite. Cation exchange does not occur only on clay minerals containing AI in tetravalent positions as it was earlier suggested. Ground kaolinite and halloysite, neither of which contains tetravalent AI, have a considerable cation-exchange capacity. Anion exchange rarely occurs on clays. This follows from the fact that after breaking such a layer as Al 2 (OH) 6 of a clay mineral, there are usually no Al ions in the equilibrium solution to form a double layer with Al as inner coat. <p/...|$|E
40|$|Dynamics <b>of</b> ortho-kintetic <b>flocculation</b> <b>of</b> PSL {{particles}} with long-chain polycation of low charge density was studied {{together with}} the adsorption process of polyelectrolyte near isoelectric point {{as a function of}} ionic strength. Within the range of investigation, the initial rate <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> was found to take the maximum value immediately after the onset of mixing, but the flocculation gradually slows down with the progress of adsorption. The initial rate <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> goes through the minimum as ionic strength increases. Without salt addition, the rate <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> is about three times faster than that of salt-induced rapid coagulation. With slightly increasing ionic strength the rate <b>of</b> <b>flocculation</b> slows down because of the reductions of the stiffness and the size of polymer coil in solution and also of the smooth rearrangement of adsorbed chains. The adsorption process monitored by the electrophoresis demonstrates that the zero mobility appears much earlier than the time predicted by collision process in the presence of salt (KCl 100 mM). This trend {{can be explained by the}} concept of electrokinetically stagnant layer and by smooth spreading of polyelectrolyte on the colloidal surface. The kinetics of adsorption is in good accordance with the change in the flocculation rate...|$|R
