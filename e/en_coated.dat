40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effect of surface {{coatings}} on the fatigue behaviour of two engineering alloys; the AISI P 20 steel and the Al 7075 -T 6, which are most commonly used to manufacture plastic injection molds, and in aerospace structures respectively. These alloys are studied for their fatigue life behaviour with and without surface coatings {{in the presence of}} machined notches, fastener holes, or clamped region which induces fretting wear. The selected surface coatings are; (1) physical vapour deposition (PVD) coatings which are most commonly used in tool applications for the AISI P 20 steel, and (2) electroless Ni-P (EN) coatings as the coating provides a uniform deposition at low process temperatures, which is beneficial for the studied aluminium alloy. First, an investigation was conducted on the fatigue performance of both studied alloys in the presence of stress raisers (notch, fretting, and a combination of notch and fretting). Fatigue tests for both alloys revealed a more dominant effect from notches compared to the fretting wear conditions. However, fractographic analyses confirmed the presence of cracks initiating from the fretting damaged surface of the combined notch and fretting fatigue Al 7075 -T 6 test specimens. Significant fretting wear marks were also observed for the combined notch and fretting fatigue AISI P 20 tool steel specimens. In the second part of this study, the fatigue behaviour of TiAlN and TiAlN/CrN PVD coatings deposited on a v-notched AISI P 20 steel was investigated. The major findings are as follows: • Unlike the un-notched (smooth) coated specimens, which are known to exhibit great improvements in fatigue life at high cycle fatigue, considerable reductions in fatigue life of the coated notched specimens were observed. This was understood to be due to the coating's brittleness at the notch tip, which induces fatigue crack initiations. • The effectiveness of the PVD coatings in resisting fretting fatigue failure of the AISI P 20 tool steel was also investigated. A significant increase in fretting fatigue life of both PVD coatings was observed. Both PVD coatings showed a beneficial compressive residual stress and substantial increases in its resistance to plastic deformation (H 3 /E 2) as well as surface hardness compared to the uncoated AISI P 20 tool steel. Finally, the fatigue behaviour of <b>EN</b> <b>coated</b> Al 7075 -T 6 fastener holes with symmetrical through slits was studied. Uncoated open-hole, <b>EN</b> <b>coated</b> open-hole, uncoated bolted hole and <b>EN</b> <b>coated</b> bolted hole specimens were fatigue tested. The major findings are as follows: • The S-N curves that were produced, showed improvements in the fatigue life due to the combined beneficial properties introduced by depositing the EN coating and bolt clamping. • The fretting fatigue life of the <b>EN</b> <b>coated</b> Al 7075 -T 6 specimens tested at high cycle fatigue was significantly improved. The harder <b>EN</b> <b>coated</b> surface was found to reduce the contact stress due to the clamping pressure and thus assisted in improving the fretting fatigue life. The <b>EN</b> <b>coated</b> surface was also found to decrease the friction coefficient which assisted in mitigating surface wear damage, thus reducing the probability for fretting cracks to initiate...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{study on}} {{mechanical}} and fracture properties, through the experimentation techniques {{has been carried}} out on a Al 7075 -T 6 and it coated with an Electroless Nickel deposits of 10 – 20 μm in coating thickness. In the recent years there has been considerable interest in the Electroless Nickel plating due to its extensive use in electronics, automobiles, aerospace and other industries. Electroless Nickel plating is a controlled autocatalytic reduction of nickel ions using suitable reducing agent such as sodium hypophosphite. ASTM Standard – E 399 for plane strain fracture toughness determination was adhered in this investigation. The results obtained, show that the <b>EN</b> <b>coating</b> can give rise to a significant improvement in the fracture behavior (performance) of the substrate and also it has shown that <b>EN</b> <b>coating</b> exhibit a very good adhesive property to the alloy material when the tensile stresses exceeding the yield strength are applied to the system and performance of these pretreatments was studied by SEM analysis...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out in order to study the fatigue and corrosion–fatigue behavior of a 7075 -T 6 aluminum alloy coated with an electroless Ni–P (EN) deposit, in the as-plated condition, of approximately 38 – 40 μm in thickness and a high P content, of approximately 18 wt%. The results obtained, show that the <b>EN</b> <b>coating</b> can give rise to a significant improvement in the fatigue and corrosion–fatigue performance of the substrate, depending on the testing conditions. When the coated system is tested in air, it is observed that the increase in fatigue properties decreases as the alternating stress applied to the material increases. At stresses of the order of 0. 4 σ 0. 2 % the increase in fatigue life is more than about 100 %. However, as the stress increases to values in the range of 0. 7 σ 0. 2 %, no improvement in the fatigue performance of the system is observed and the behavior {{is similar to that of}} the uncoated substrate. Under corrosion–fatigue conditions, the fatigue life is observed to increase between approximately 60 % and 70 %, depending on the stress applied. It is shown that fatigue cracks are associated with nodular-like defects present on the surface of the coated samples. The deleterious effect of such defects seems to be more pronounced as the alternating stress applied to the material increases. A crude estimate of the yield strength of the <b>EN</b> <b>coating</b> from tensile measurements indicates that such a parameter is in the range of 3. 8 GPa, in agreement with the computation of the absolute hardness of the deposit, of about 4 GPa, by means of Meyer's law. It is also shown that the EN deposit has a very good adhesion to the substrate even when the system is subjected to tensile stresses greater than the yield strength. Such characteristics as well as the higher mechanical properties of the <b>EN</b> <b>coating</b> in comparison with the aluminum alloy substrate and the preservation of its integrity during fatigue testing contribute to the better fatigue performance of the coated system...|$|R
40|$|During {{preliminary}} {{vehicle design}} reviews, requests {{were made to}} change flight termination systems from an electroless nickel (<b>EN)</b> connector <b>coating</b> to a zinc-nickel (ZN) plating. The reason for these changes was due to a new NASA-STD- 6012 corrosion requirement where connectors must meet the performance requirement of 168 hr of exposure to salt spray. The specification for class F connectors, MIL-DTL- 38999, certifies the <b>EN</b> <b>coating</b> will meet a 48 -hr salt spray test, whereas the ZN is certified to meet a 168 -hr salt spray test. The ZN finish is a concern because Marshall Space Flight Center has no flight experience with ZN-finished connectors, and MSFC-STD- 3012 indicates that zinc and zinc alloys should not be used. The purpose of this test was to run a 168 -hr salt spray test to verify the electrical and mechanical integrity of the EN connectors and officially document the results. The salt spray test was conducted per ASTM B 117 on several MIL-DTL- 38999 flight-like connectors mounted to an aluminum 6061 -T 6 bracket that was alodined. The configuration, mounting techniques, electrical checks, and materials used were typical of flight and ground support equipment...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of Electroless Nickel-Phosphorus (EN) coatings has witnessed a staggering increase {{during the last}} two decades. Many outstanding characteristics of the <b>EN</b> <b>coating</b> method have generated {{a lot of interest in}} various industries including oil and gas, electronic, chemical, automotive, aerospace, and mining. Some of the highlighted characteristics of EN coatings are superior corrosion and wear resistance especially in environments containing H 2 S and CO 2, superior mechanical properties, uniform coating thickness, excellent surface finish properties, superb adhesion characteristics, and wide range of thickness. The <b>EN</b> <b>coating</b> process is based on a redox reaction in which a reducing agent is oxidized and Ni+ 2 ions are reduced on the surface of the substrate materials. Once the first layer of Ni is deposited, it acts as a catalyst for the process. Consequently, a linear relationship between coating thickness and time usually occurs. If the reducing agent is sodium hypophosphite, the deposit obtained will be a nickel-phosphorus alloy. The objective of this research was to evaluate various properties of three types of EN coatings, namely, low, medium, and high phosphorus. In the first phase of this work an automated prototype EN bath was designed and engineered. As a result, three types of EN coatings were deposited on various substrates. In the second phase of this research, various qualitative and quantitive methods were implemented to evaluate various properties of EN coatings. Also, the effects of various coating parameters including coating thickness and phosphorus content on properties of EN coatings were comprehensively investigated. Furthermore, the effect of post heat treatment on various properties of EN coatings was studied. Heat treatment on EN deposits in the range of 300 - 400 °C for one hour caused the hardness to increase due to the formation of various types of nickel phosphide (NixPy). The results of this study showed that various properties of EN coatings are directly related to the phosphorus content of the coatings. EN coatings with lower phosphorus content are crystalline, hard and brittle. As a result, they have superior wear resistance. On the other hand, EN coatings with higher phosphorus content are amorphous with superior corrosion resistance. iii EN coatings in general have excellent adhesion properties. However, the degree of adhesion is affected by several parameters including coating thickness, phosphorus content, post heat treatment, and ductility of the substrate. Moreover, it was shown that due their brittle nature EN coatings in general and heat-treated low phosphorus <b>EN</b> <b>coating</b> in particular have a detrimental effect on fatigue properties of their substrates. It was also shown that EN coatings in general, improve the kinetic coefficient of friction. In other words, EN coatings exhibit a self-lubricating behavior. Also, it was shown that EN coatings completely follow the surface profile of their substrate unlike conventional electroplating. Corrosion and wear studies on EN coatings revealed that EN coatings are excellent candidates for materials subjected to excessive corrosion and wear in a potash brine environment. Finally, the microstructure study of EN coatings using TEM and STEM electron microscopy revealed valuable information regarding the phase transformation during the heat treatment. It was shown that heat treatment at 400 °C for one hour caused the precipitation of various nickel phosphide particles. As a result, significant changes in various properties of EN coatings occurred...|$|R
40|$|AbstractElectroless nickel (EN) {{deposits}} {{are classified}} as anefficient class of coatings used mainly to enhance the surface performance characteristics {{of a range of}} substrates. Electroless coating differs from conventional electrolytic coating on the basis of uniform deposition, coating of nonconductive materials and operation without the aid of electricity. Severalinvestigations devoted to the engineering facetsof EN and their technologies along with the applications have been published. Co-deposition of inert elements such as silicon carbide, Teflon or boron improved the mechanical properties of EN deposits. Furthermore, introduction of a third element (forming alloy of Ni-P-X/Ni-B-X; X=Cu, W, Mo, Sn, etc.) is also found to enhance the coating performance. The improvementin tribological featuresdone with modiﬁcation of the bath formulation and the coatingprocedurehas persisted as a key research interest in investigators. Application of coating in high temperature field again reveals the softening of the material and deterioration in the wear resistant activity causing the shortening of life of the component. In brief, the performance of EN depends upon various process parameters, composition, heat treatment, operating temperature, etc. In the present work, an effort has been made to review the properties of <b>EN</b> <b>coating</b> at elevated temperature...|$|R

40|$|Microarc {{oxidation}} (MAO) coating {{was developed}} as an interlayer for the electroless nickel (<b>EN)</b> top <b>coat</b> {{to improve the}} corrosion resistance of Mg alloy. Prior to the electroless nickel coating, oxide layer was activated by using NaBH 4 solution {{as a replacement for}} traditional chromate and HF activation process. The EN coatings were prepared from the alkaline carbonate bath. The prepared coatings were characterized for the surface morphology and composition using Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) attached with Energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDX). Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were carried out in non-deaerated 3. 5 % NaCl solution to find out the corrosion resistance of the coatings. The MAO coating showed porous morphology with micro cracks whereas, MAO/Ni-P coating exhibited dense nodular structure. The composition analysis on the surface of MAO/Ni-P showed 10 wt. % P indicated the high P coating. The cross- sectional images showed good adhesion between MAO and Ni-P layers. This clearly indicates that the present activation process results in dense with uniform pores of MAO coating which supply excellent bonding interface for Ni–P coat. The MAO/EN coating combination showed about 97 times improved corrosion resistance as compared with the substrate and similar behaviour was observed by EIS studies...|$|R
