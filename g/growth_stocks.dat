25|$|Investors, {{including}} {{the likes of}} Warren Buffett, and researchers have disputed the efficient-market hypothesis both empirically and theoretically. Behavioral economists attribute the imperfections in financial markets {{to a combination of}} cognitive biases such as overconfidence, overreaction, representative bias, information bias, and various other predictable human errors in reasoning and information processing. These have been researched by psychologists such as Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, Richard Thaler, and Paul Slovic. These errors in reasoning lead most investors to avoid value stocks and buy <b>growth</b> <b>stocks</b> at expensive prices, which allow those who reason correctly to profit from bargains in neglected value stocks and the overreacted selling of <b>growth</b> <b>stocks.</b> Investors prefer riskier funds in spring and safer funds in autumn.|$|E

One way is to examine the performance of simple value strategies, such as buying low PE ratio stocks, low price-to-cash-flow ratio stocks, or low price-to-book ratio stocks. Numerous academics have published studies investigating the effects of buying value stocks. These studies have consistently found that value stocks outperform <b>growth</b> <b>stocks</b> and the market as a whole.|$|E
