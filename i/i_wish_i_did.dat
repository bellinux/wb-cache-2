Lifted had produced the beat in November 2011, and his manager was responsible for playing the beat to West which led to him wanting to work with Lifted. Furthermore, Kanye played the embryotic version to Anthony [...] "The Twilite Tone" [...] Khan and additional production was done including {{but not limited to}} samples and the part in which Kanye raps over. [...] Both Pusha T and Big Sean recorded their verses in January 2012 and the song was mixed and finalized in March. Producer Hit-Boy, known for producing West's [...] "Niggas in Paris", commented that [...] "It's fresh, it's new, it's something you haven't heard before. It's elements of trap, but it's just some fresh, new-sounding stuff. I'm excited about it. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it, but I didn't".|$|E
60|$|LORETTA. [Sobbing.] That's the trouble. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> love him. Oh, I wish I were dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} know where to find him; and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> for he has only to take two more trout to win," [...] Lilian added significantly.|$|E
60|$|I {{explained}} that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know her, and though <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{because she was}} so pretty, it would not perhaps be quite right to go to her house to see her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} was a joke! but <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> hadn't <b>done</b> it. It seemed {{at the moment that}} I should look to be cross if <b>I</b> didn't <b>do</b> as he bade me. But when he had said that about being at home--! Oh, Mrs. Roden, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had not <b>done</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The others {{told me you}} had a headache. I'm {{very sorry}} to hear that. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> {{something}} {{to make you feel}} better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No more I know, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> [...] And I {{would tell}} {{it all to}} you; [...] For what became of this poor child [...] There's none that ever knew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet!" [...] he begged. [...] "It's early. You say I don't {{understand}} you, Janet--my God, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did!</b> It breaks me {{all up to}} see you cry like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not?" [...] {{she said}} helplessly. [...] "I don't know. Perhaps {{that is what}} I do wish. Ah, but what are wishes! I know now that they don't matter at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{she said}} in an {{undertone}} of intimacy. [...] "Genius.... A great irresponsible genius.... Difficult to help.... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> more for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, many a time I've {{looked at}} people smoking, and thought well <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> that; but <b>I</b> never thought I could," [...] said Tom.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see." [...] The {{former teacher}} of Oak Hall gritted his teeth. [...] "Oh, how <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> {{something}} to punish Porter and those others!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Tom! <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{know where}} you have gone!" [...] said Fred, shaking his head sadly as he gazed on the floor, and taking no notice {{whatever}} of the threatening action of his visitor.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Devil take you,' {{interrupted}} Jonas, {{but in a}} suppressed voice still; 'what harm do {{you suppose}} she has come to? I know no more where she is than you do; <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Wait till she comes home, and see; she can't be long. Will that content you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{look like}} Mother either. She was tiny and dark--she had a sweet little face and velvet-brown eyes and soft curly dark hair. Oh, I {{remember}} her look so well. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> resemble her. I loved her so--I {{would have done}} anything to save her suffering and trouble. At least, she died in peace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No Sally; it's not my secret. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> something--help them somehow. Yes, it's sure {{a terrible}} mix. I don't {{care so much}} about myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} we're to end. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> did--How <b>do</b> bad people end?--especially {{as to their}} COMMON crimes. You have made me as bad as yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's an outrage! Oh, Sam, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> something!" [...] And {{unable to}} control his feelings, Tom clenched his hands and began to pace the floor.|$|R
6000|$|Said Kim in English, distressed for the lama's agony: 'I {{think if}} you will let me go now we will walk away quietly and not steal. We will look for that River like before I was caught. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not come here to find the Red Bull and {{all that sort of}} thing. I do not want it.' ...|$|E
60|$|That was how {{he killed}} his first deer. How the others were taken I do not know; <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> since this one exploit of a Wiltshire {{shepherd}} has more interest for me than I find in fifty narratives of elephants slaughtered wholesale with explosive bullets, written for the delight and astonishment of the reading public by our most glorious Nimrods.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know any}} good word to say," [...] she answered, [...] "except {{that you take}} {{excellent}} care of babies, and I am {{not at all sure}} that that would have any weight with Stephen Petter. Since you are going to the inn, and since we have already talked together so much, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> properly know you. Did you ever have a sister at Vassar?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O Matildy, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> {{something}} for you! I {{want to help}} you so. I feel so bad that I didn't come before. Ain't they somethin'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know how}} you feel," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> so; but <b>I</b> can't make an {{exception}} in your favor without offending the Parkers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} the {{slightest}} idea. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> know," [...] <b>I</b> declared truthfully. [...] "There is no man whom I am more anxious to see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Which of {{them are}} you reading? 'Country Walks.' That is not one that I care about, it is a mere hash of old recollections; {{but there are some}} very {{sensible}} and superior ones, so that I have heard it sometimes doubted whether they are man's or woman's writing. For my part, I think them too earnest to be a man's; men always play with their subject." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is another}} little device that men inevitably will rediscover. It is called gunpowder. It was what {{enabled us to}} kill surely and at long distances. Certain things which {{are found in the}} ground, when {{combined}} in the right proportions, will make this gunpowder. What these things are, I have forgotten, or else I never knew. But <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> know. Then would I make powder, and then would I certainly kill Cross-Eyes and rid the land of superstition--" ...|$|E
6000|$|No more I know, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> [...] And I {{would tell}} {{it all to}} you [...] For what became of this poor child [...] There's none that ever knew [...] And if a child was born or no, [...] There's no one that could ever tell; [...] And if 'twas born alive or dead, [...] There's no one knows, as I have said: [...] But some {{remember}} well, [...] That Martha Ray about this time [...] Would up the mountain often climb." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The more I see of America," [...] sighed Archie, [...] "the more it amazes me. All you birds seem to {{have been}} doing things from the cradle upwards. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> things!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I don't {{want him}} to turn out a dull blockhead,' he said, 'and so I propose that you should take charge of him, and teach him to keep himself young. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had <b>done</b> it, myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>wish,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>wish,</b> <b>I</b> had a boat to mend,' {{cried the}} fox again, {{as if he}} had not heard. And the man grew angry and seized him by the tail, and threw him far out in the stream close to the edge of an island; which was just what the fox wanted. He easily {{scrambled}} up, and sitting on the top, he called: 'Hasten, hasten, O fishes, and carry me to the other side!' And the fishes left the stones where they had been sleeping, and the pools where they had been feeding, and hurried to see who could get to the island first.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Johnny. [...] "I sleep right through, thank goodness. Sometimes I wake up {{very early}} in the spring before the snow is all gone, earlier than <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> That is where my fat comes in handy. It keeps me warm and keeps me alive until I can find the first green plants. Perhaps you have noticed that early in the spring I am as thin as I was fat in the fall. This is because I have used up the fat, waiting for the first green things to appear." ...|$|E
6000|$|XIV [...] "More know I not, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> [...] 145 [...] And {{it should}} all be told to you; [17] [...] For what became of this poor child [...] No mortal ever knew; [18] [...] Nay--if a child to her was born [...] No earthly tongue could ever tell; [19] [...] 150 [...] And if 'twas born alive or dead, [...] Far less could this with proof be said; [20] [...] But some {{remember}} well, [...] That Martha Ray about this time [...] Would up the mountain often climb. [...] 155 ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see your}} face in every scene of my dreams, and hear your voice in every sound. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not. It {{is too much}} what I feel. They say such love never lasts. But it must! And yet once, I remember, I saw {{an officer of the}} Hussars ride down the street at Budmouth, and though he was a total {{stranger}} and never spoke to me, I loved him till I thought I should really die of love--but I didn't die, and at last I left off caring for him. How terrible it would be if a time should come when I could not love you, my Clym!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear so," [...] said Coote. [...] "Really, you know, {{an awfully}} fine young fellow--Gifted! But full of this dreadful Modern Spirit--Cynical! All this Overman stuff. Nietzsche and all that.... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> {{something}} for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear brother, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> {{more for}} you; but till Mr. Enderby goes, I cannot, for the {{soldiers}} are about the kitchen, and our maid, Deborah, talks too much to be trustworthy, though she is thoroughly faithful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{she left}} {{it on the table}} where I was sitting, where I could see it, and it is this very one, so I must not look at it; <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> sums as fast as she can.' ...|$|R
