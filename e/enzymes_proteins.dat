40|$|The {{inactive}} precursor {{form of the}} pneumococcal autolytic enzyme cloned in Escherichia coli {{was isolated}} by affinity chromatography on Sepharose-linked choline. The enzyme was recovered in an electrophoretically pure and activated form by elution from the affinity column with radioactive choline solution. When radioactive choline was used for elutions, the <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein</b> isolated contained protein-bound choline, at approximately 1 mol of choline per mol of <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein,</b> indicating {{the presence of a}} single choline recognition site. Radioactive choline remained bound to the <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein</b> during dialysis, precipitation by trichloroacetic acid or ammonium sulfate, and during gel filtration, but not during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Incubation of the choline-labeled autolysin with pneumococcal cell walls at 0 degrees C resulted in the adsorption of the enzyme to the wall particles and a simultaneous release of free choline from the <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein.</b> It is suggested that the choline molecules that became bound to the <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein</b> during the activation of autolysin are expelled from the choline-binding site and replaced by choline residues from the wall teichoic acid as the autolysin molecules adsorb to their insoluble substrate before the onset of enzymatic wall hydrolysis...|$|R

40|$|It was {{demonstrated}} that r-cystathionase [EC 4. 4. 1. 1] incorporates the S-atom of L-cystine as a labile sulfane S-atom {{in the course}} of the cystine cleavage reaction. The MS-labeled native f-cystathionase gradually released MS. However, when the <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein</b> was denatured with 5 % trichloroacetic acid, the release of MS from the <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein</b> was considerably suppressed. The release of MS from the native <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein</b> was markedly enhanced by incubation with L-cystine. "S was eliminated from the native enzyme with L-cystine as the sulfide ion, which was identified by trapping with lead acetate. The apparent Km of L-cystine for the 35 S release (2. 7 x 10 ~ 5 M) was comparable to that of ["SJcystine for MS incorporation into the <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein</b> (2. 5 x 10 ~ 6 M). SH compounds such as dithiothreitol could also release the S-atom from the <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein.</b> The elimination reaction by these SH compounds seems to be nonenzymatic, since these SH compounds could eliminate MS from the denatured "S-labeled enzyme. Iodoacetamide did not inhibit the homoserine deaminase, cystathionine lyase or cystine cleavage activities of 7 -cystathionase. However, the incorporation of the S-atom from L-cystine into the <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein</b> and the release of the S-atom from the <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein</b> with L-cystine were markedly inhibited in the presence of 5 mM iodoacetamide, indicating that iodoacetamide inhibits the S-atom incorporation by trapping the thiol formed from L-cystine by cystine cleavage. The thiol trapped with iodoacetamide was analyzed by using ["Qiodoacetamide, [^Qcystine or P'S]-cystine. The compounds formed from the thiol and iodoacetamide were identified as cystine-thioglycolamide mixed disulfide and thioglycolamide disulfide, which was enzymatically derived from the mixed disulfide. From these results, the mechanism of the cystine cleavage reaction catalyzed by 7 [...] cystathionase is proposed to be as follows: (1) L-cystine is cleaved to pyruvate...|$|R

40|$|A {{radioimmunoassay}} for {{ornithine decarboxylase}} {{was used to}} study the regulation of this enzyme in rat liver. The antiserum used reacts with ornithine decarboxylase from mouse, human or rat cells. Rat liver ornithine decarboxylase enzyme activity and <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein</b> (as determined by radioimmunoassay) were measured in thioacetamide-treated rats at various times after administration of 1, 3 -diaminopropane. Enzyme activity declined rapidly after 1, 3 -diaminopropane treatment as did the amount of <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein,</b> although the disappearance of enzyme activity slightly preceded the loss of immunoreactive protein. The loss of <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein</b> after cycloheximide treatment also occurred rapidly, but was significantly slower than that seen with 1, 3 -diaminopropane. When 1, 3 -diaminopropane and cycloheximide were injected simultaneously, the rate of disappearance of enzyme activity and <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein</b> {{was the same as}} that seen with cycloheximide alone. These results show that the rapid loss in enzyme activity after 1, 3 -diaminopropane treatment is primarily due to a loss in <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein</b> and that protein synthesis is needed in order for 1, 3 -diaminopropane to exert its full effect. A macromolecular inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase that has been termed antizyme is induced in response to 1, 3 -diaminopropane, but our results indicate that the loss of enzyme activity is not due to the accumulation of inactive ornithine decarboxylase-antizyme complexes. It is possible that the antizyme enhances the degradation of the <b>enzyme</b> <b>protein.</b> Control experiments demonstrated that the antiserum used would have detected any inactive antizyme-ornithine decarboxylase complexes present in liver since addition of antizyme to ornithine decarboxylase in vitro did not affect the amount of ornithine decarboxylase detected in our radioimmunoassay. Anti-(ornithine decarboxylase) antibodies may be useful in the purification of antizyme since the antizyme-ornithine decarboxylase complex can be immunoprecipitated, and antizyme released from the precipitate with 0. 3 M-NaCl...|$|R

50|$|The {{structure}} of a transcription factory appears {{to be determined by}} cell type, transcriptional activity of the cell and also the method of technique used to visualise the structure. The generalised view of a transcription factory would feature between 4 - 30 RNA polymerase molecules and it is thought that the more transcriptionally active a cell is, the more polymerases that will be present in a factory {{in order to meet the}} demands of transcription. The core of the factory is porous and protein rich, with the hyperphosphorylated, elongating form polymerases on the perimeter. The type of proteins present include: ribonucleoproteins, co-activators, transcription factors, RNA helicase and splicing and processing enzymes. A factory only contains one type of RNA polymerase and the diameter of the factory varies depending on the RNA polymerase featured; RNA polymerase I factories are roughly 500 nm in width whereas RNA polymerase II and III factories a magnitude smaller at 50 nm. It has been experimentally shown that the transcription factory is immobilised to a structure and it is postulated that this immobilisation is because of a tethering to the nuclear matrix; this is because it has been shown it is tied to a structure that is unaffected by restriction <b>enzymes.</b> <b>Proteins</b> that have been thought to be involved in the tethering includes spectrin, actin and lamins.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation system in liver and cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy known to accumulate very long chain fatty acids. In {{order to examine}} whether the deficient peroxisomal oxidation of very long chain fatty acids in these patients results from a deficiency {{in one of the}} peroxisomal beta-oxidation <b>enzyme</b> <b>proteins</b> (acyl-CoA oxidase, bifunctional protein with enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities and 3 -oxoacyl-CoA thiolase) we carried out immunoblotting experiments using antibodies directed against the peroxisomal beta-oxidation <b>enzyme</b> <b>proteins</b> from rat liver.
