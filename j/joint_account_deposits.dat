5000|$|Sometimes a {{temporary}} <b>joint</b> <b>account</b> is opened by two parties entering into a transaction where one party needs a {{security for the}} fulfilment of the transaction and the other party has to pay the sum (deposit), being the security for the other party.

5000|$|In the United States, {{there are}} {{typically}} {{two types of}} <b>joint</b> <b>accounts</b> - survivorship accounts and convenience <b>accounts.</b> Either <b>joint</b> owner of the account may withdraw funds during the lifetime of both owners, and most states have statutes protecting the bank from claims brought by one joint owner against the bank if the other owner [...] "wrongfully" [...] withdraws funds from the <b>joint</b> <b>account.</b> The distinction between survivorship and convenience accounts matters at {{the death of one}} of the owners. If the <b>joint</b> <b>account</b> is a survivorship account, the ownership of the account goes to the surviving <b>joint</b> <b>account</b> holder. <b>Joint</b> survivorship <b>accounts</b> are often created in order to avoid probate. If two individuals open a <b>joint</b> <b>account</b> and one of them dies, the other person is entitled to the remaining balance and liable for the debt of that account.|$|R

Temporary <b>joint</b> <b>accounts</b> are used in transactions in which large sums of money are involved as an alternative to letters of credit or escrow accounts.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a fundamental conundrum {{at the heart}} of meaning-making: how are multiple meanings accommodated within a <b>joint</b> <b>account,</b> given the plurivocal nature of organizations? While a new strategic initiative introduces new meanings that must coexist within multiple prevailing meanings; studies on meaning-making processes place different emphases on the accommodation of such multiplicity within a <b>joint</b> <b>account.</b> Based on the findings from a longitudinal case study conducted in a university setting, we develop a framework that demonstrates two patterns of meaning-making on the basis of distinct micro processes of expanding, combining and reframing that are involved in the accomplishment of a <b>joint</b> <b>account.</b> Our study offers counter-intuitive insights into the way vested interests enable or constrain the construction of a <b>joint</b> <b>account</b> of meaning. In doing so, we contribute to knowledge about resistance, ambiguity and the role of agreement, or lack of agreement in constructing <b>joint</b> <b>accounts</b> within a plurivocal context...|$|R

30|$|While the {{presence}} of banks {{may be seen as}} a benchmark of financial development, the types of services banks offer may also be important. There are four types of accounts offered by banks in this study: checking <b>accounts,</b> time <b>deposit</b> <b>accounts,</b> demand <b>deposit</b> savings <b>accounts,</b> and credit card accounts. The communities in which banks are present show positive numbers of checking <b>accounts</b> and time <b>deposit</b> <b>accounts.</b> However, not all banked communities offer demand <b>deposit</b> savings <b>accounts</b> or credit card accounts.

When the Bank debited the trust account the next day, it was not making a payment to M or to an agent acting for him alone.

In April 1829 £6117 10s was transferred from that <b>joint</b> <b>account</b> to a separate account in the sole name of Foley. The bank sent a letter enclosing the receipt and agreeing to pay 3 per cent interest on the sum. From 1829 until 1834, when the <b>joint</b> <b>account</b> was closed, Foley's share of the profits of the collieries was paid by cheques drawn on the <b>joint</b> <b>account</b> by the agents managing the collieries. These cheques were paid in cash or by bills drawn by them on their London bankers in favour of Foley, and none of them were paid into his separate account.
