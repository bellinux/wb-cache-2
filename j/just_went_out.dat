5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E
25|$|In October 2011, it was {{reported}} that Fox Broadcasting Company and Sony Pictures were considering a television adaption of the series to be aired on CBS, with Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese writing the script, but with the main actors of the original film likely not returning. The television program was planned to begin in fall, 2012. These plans did not come to fruition. In January 2013, it was revealed that the casting call for the production <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> for the main characters, with a few changes to the movie for the show and the addition of two new characters, Atlanta and Ainsley.|$|E

6000|$|MALISE. Thick as blackberries. I <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and cry, [...] "MALISE, {{unsuccessful}} author, too honest journalist, freethinker, co-respondent, bankrupt," [...] {{and they}} tumble! ...|$|R
2500|$|Following a brief tour in Europe, Hodges {{arranged}} {{an engagement}} for Double Trouble as The Moody Blues' opening act during a two-month tour of North America. Hodges stated {{that many people}} disliked the idea of Double Trouble opening for The Moody Blues, but asserted that a common thread that both bands shared was [...] "album-oriented rock". Shannon described the tour as [...] "glorious": [...] "Our record hadn't become that successful yet, but we were playing in front of coliseums full of people. We <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> and played, and it fit like a glove. The sound rang through those big coliseums like a monster. People were going crazy, {{and they had no}} idea who we were!" [...] After appearing on the television series Austin City Limits, the band played a sold-out concert at New York City's Beacon Theatre. Variety wrote that their ninety-minute set at the Beacon [...] "left no doubt that this young Texas musician is indeed the 'guitar hero of the present era.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2000 Dirty Three {{released}} another studio album, Whatever You Love, You Are which McFarlane found showed [...] "deep, rich, emotional musical vistas, and furthered the band's {{connection to}} the music and approach of jazz great John Coltrane". In 2002, Dirty Three toured Taiwan together with US indie rocker Chan Marshall (aka Cat Power) and both artists returned in 2004. Also in 2004, they gigged at the Meredith Music Festival where a rain storm threatened their set, Ellis later remembered [...] "we <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> and played like our lives depended on it ... and you all went for it; otherwise it just fell to pieces". In late 2005, Dirty Three released their seventh major album, Cinder. Although following {{in the spirit of}} Ocean Songs, it diverges from their previous works: it was their first album to feature vocals (from Marshall and from Sally Timms of The Mekons), albeit on two of nineteentracks. Its tracks are generally shorter and more concise; and instead of their usual live-in-the-studio technique they recorded each member's work individually.|$|E

60|$|I didn't {{get back}} here till nearly ten, and the maid told me Jenny had <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out.</b> I thought she'd gone back to her mother's.|$|R
5000|$|... "He's small," [...] said Tagg. [...] "He's {{not that}} good-looking; he's not a robust horse by any means. He <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> there and gets it done." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I cannot say for certain," [...] Ronald replied; [...] "but {{if you ask}} {{my opinion}} I should say, that having no stomach for meeting people outside, he <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> the way I came in, {{especially}} as I heard the worshipful magistrate say that a board in the attic had been lifted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, you do {{not know}} yourself. You have lived all your life in the {{neighbourhood}} of that Mr. Morton who <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> and you feel pity for his illness. He does indeed look very ill--but you have yet to learn what it is to love. I ask the high favour of being permitted to attempt the office of--of--of--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said Patty {{in utter}} bewilderment, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to Mr. Reid's {{and asked for}} the gentleman who was visiting there--I'd {{forgotten}} his name--and Mr. Reefer came down and I told him my brother had been detailed to interview him {{on behalf of the}} Chronicle about the bill, and that Clifford had missed his train, and wouldn't he let me interview him in his place and excuse my inexperience--and he did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's nothing I {{want to do}} {{more than}} help you to get better. I'll <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and send a wire, and then I'll be right back." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It was terrible. It {{was some}} kind of a stroke. He had been working too hard and taking no exercise. You know when he sent Steve away that time he didn't engage anybody else in his place. He went back to his old way of living, which the doctor had warned him against. He worked and worked, until one day, Bailey says, he fainted at the office. They brought him home, and he <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> like a burned-out candle. I--I went to him, but for a long time he wouldn't see me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure. But I don't {{know what}} struck 'm. All {{of a sudden}} his heart got into it. He <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> like a streak and cleaned up all the little local fellows. Seemed to want the money, and he's won a bit, though his clothes don't look it. He's peculiar. Nobody knows his business. Nobody knows how he spends his time. Even when he's on the job, he plumb up and disappears most of each day soon as his work is done. Sometimes he just blows away {{for weeks at a}} time. But he don't take advice. There's a fortune in it for the fellow that gets the job of managin' him, only he won't {{consider}} it. And you watch him hold out for the cash money when you get down to terms." ...|$|E
5000|$|According {{to another}} version, Banykin was not {{involved}} in any fighting. The local Tolyatti historian Alexander Turaev wrote in the 1960s that Banykin <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of town and on the outskirts was shot dead by a [...] "local White Guard".|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{so sorry}} that Lady Mountjoy has <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out.</b> She did not expect you till the later train. You have been staying at Boulogne. What on earth made you stay at Boulogne?" ...|$|R

5000|$|In June 1975, Tierney was {{questioned}} by New York City police {{in connection with}} the apparent suicide of a 24-year-old woman who had jumped from the window of her high-rise apartment.

5000|$|From 1933 {{editorial}} {{about the}} futility of war (referring to World War I): The boys who died <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> and died.

5000|$|We never {{recorded}} as The Sisterhood, we <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> and played some gigs. ... Andrew {{recorded as}} The Sisterhood, {{and since he}} released something prior to us he got to claim the name. ... To be terribly honest now, I think Andrew was right. I mean, {{two members of the}} band going off and trading on their old band? It's like two ex-members of The Mission going off and naming themselves as The Missionaries. It's a bit cheap.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> on her donkey--somewhere {{about the}} place. She rides on a donkey mostly every day. But you'll stop {{and take a}} bit of dinner with us? Eh, now do 'ee, Master Frank." ...|$|R

60|$|When Gyp {{was shown}} into this well-remembered room he was seated, his yellow fingers buried in his stiff grey hair, grieving over a pupil who had <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out.</b> He did not {{immediately}} rise, but stared hard at Gyp.|$|R
