40|$|Background: A {{decrease}} in core body temperature caused by heat distribution {{depends on the}} anesthetic agent used. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the effects of sevoflurane and propofol on core temperature during laparoscopic major abdominal surgery requiring pneumoperitoneum of more than 90 min. Methods: Fifty adult patients undergoing laparoscopic major abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to either a sevoflurane group (n = 25) or a propofol group (n = 25). In the sevoflurane group, anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg, remifentanil 1. 0 μg/kg, and maintained with 0. 8 - 2. 0 vol % sevoflurane and 0. 1 - 0. 2 μg/kg/min remifentanil. In the propofol group, anesthesia was induced with the effect-site concentration of propofol of 5. 0 μg/ ml and remifentanil 4 ng/ml, and maintained with the effect-site concentration of propofol of 2 - 3. 5 μg/ml and remifentanil 3 - 5 ng/ml. Core body temperature was measured with an <b>esophageal</b> <b>stethoscope</b> with a temperature sensor after the start of the pneumoperitoneum (baseline) and at 15 -min intervals until completion of surgery. Results: During the study period, core temperature was comparable between the two groups. When compared with baseline values, core temperatures in both groups were significantly decreased 45 min after pneumoperitoneum. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that in patients undergoing prolonged laparoscopic surgery, a {{decrease in}} core body temperature during sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia was not different than propofol-remifentanil anesthesia, and the incidence of hypothermia of the two groups did not differ.

40|$|Background: The basic {{requirements}} for monitoring anesthetized patients during surgery are assessing cardiac and respiratory function. Esophageal stethoscopes {{have been developed}} for this purpose, but these devices may not provide clear heart and lung sound due to existence of various noises in operating rooms. In addition, the stethoscope is not applicable for continues monitoring, and it is unsuitable for observing inaccessible patients in some conditions such as during CT scan. Objective: A wireless electronic <b>esophageal</b> <b>stethoscope</b> is designed for continues auscultation of heart and lung sounds in anesthetized patients. The system consists of a transmitter and a receiver. The former acquires, amplifies and transmits the acquired sound signals to the latter via a frequency modulation transmitter. The receiver demodulates, amplifies, and delivers the received signal to a headphone to be heard by anesthesiologist. Results: The usability and effectiveness of the designed system was qualitatively evaluated by 5 anesthesiologists in Namazi Hospital and Shahid Chamran Hospital, Shiraz, Iran on 30 patients in several operating rooms in different conditions; e. g., when electro surgery instruments are working. Fortunately, the experts on average ranked good quality for the heard heart and lung sounds and very good on the user friendly being of the instrument. Conclusion: Evaluation results demonstrate that the developed system is capable of capturing and transmitting heart and lung sounds successfully. Therefore, {{it can be used to}} continuously monitor anesthetized patients’ cardiac and respiratory function. Since via the instrument wireless auscultation is possible, it could be suitable for observing inaccessible patients in several conditions such as during CT scan...|$|E
