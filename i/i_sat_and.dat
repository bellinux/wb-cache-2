"Can't Hold Us Down" [...] lyrically {{discusses}} feminism; {{the song}} criticizes [...] "common" [...] gender-related double standards, {{in which men}} are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave {{in a similar fashion}} are disdained. In the book Therapeutic Uses of Rap and Hip-Hop, Susan Hadley and George Yancy discuss that [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] is a hip hop song that [...] "encourages young women to be proud, strong, and empowered to be all that they can be". At the song's first verse, Aguilera sings [...] "Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind / Guess it's easier for you to swallow if <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>and</b> smiled"; she later rejects that all women [...] "should be seen, not heard" [...] and encourages them to [...] "shout louder" [...] during the chorus. Aguilera comments on the double standard with the lyrics [...] "The guy gets all the glory the more he can score / While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore". Lil' Kim shares a similar sentiment during her verse in the bridge, questioning why a man is able to give a woman [...] "some sex or sex her raw" [...] while [...] "if the girl do the same and then she's a whore".|$|E

40|$|A new assay for the {{determination}} of lactosylceramide- 2, 3 -sialyltransferase (<b>SAT</b> <b>I,</b> EC 2. 4. 99. 9) <b>and</b> monosialoganglioside sialyltransferase (<b>SAT</b> IV, EC 2. 4. 99. 2) is described. The assay utilised the commercially available fluorophore labelled sphingolipids, boron dipyrromethene difluoride (BODIPY) lactosylceramide (LacCer), and BODIPY-monosialotetrahexosyl-ganglioside (GM 1) as the acceptor substrates, for <b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>SAT</b> IV, respectively. HPLC coupled with fluorescence detection was used to analyse product formation. The analysis was performed in a quick and automated fashion. The assay showed good linearity for both BODIPY sphingolipids with a quantitative detection limit of 0. 05 pmol. The high sensitivity enabled the detection of <b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>SAT</b> IV activities as low as 0. 001 mU, at least 200 fold {{lower than that of}} most radiometric assays. This new assay was applied to the screening of <b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>SAT</b> IV activities in ovine and bovine organs (liver, heart, kidney, and spleen). The results provided evidence that young animals, such as calves, start to produce ganglioside sialyltransferases as early as 7 days after parturition and that levels change during maturation. Among the organs tested from a bovine source, spleen had the highest specific ganglioside sialyltransferase activity. Due to the organ size, the greatest total ganglioside sialyltransferase activities (<b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>SAT</b> IV) were detected in the liver of both bovine and ovine origin...|$|R
