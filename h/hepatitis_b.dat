5|$|During {{the period}} of time of removal of thiomersal, the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> vaccine in {{children}} not at risk for hepatitis. This decision, though following the precautionary principle, nevertheless sparked confusion, controversy and some harm. Approximately 10% of hospitals suspended the use of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> vaccine for all newborns, and one child born to a Michigan mother infected with <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus died of it. Similarly, a study found that the number of hospitals who failed to properly vaccinate infants of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> seropositive mothers rose by over 6 times. This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly liver cancer.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> A and <b>B</b> {{represent}} a significant threat to international travelers.

Current vaccination recommendations should be revised to ensure adequate immunity for all international travelers against <b>hepatitis</b> A and <b>B,</b> as both diseases pose comparable danger. Since exposure to the viruses cannot be predicted, vaccination should be offered to all individuals visiting destinations with intermediate or high endemicities of <b>hepatitis</b> A and/or <b>B,</b> regardless of length of stay and standard of accommodation. Risk groups and endemicity of <b>hepatitis</b> A and <b>B</b> overlap, therefore, a combination vaccine against both forms is beneficial...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{covers the}} topic of <b>Hepatitis</b> type <b>B.</b> The goal of the thesis was {{to find out the}} public knowledge about this illness {{and at the same time}} also to find out whether the citizens use their own personal hygiene products and protective means. The results of the research say that the citizens outside the health industry older 15 years of age in České Budějovice and Pelhřimov do not have the knowledge on the ways of transfer and protection for the <b>Hepatitis</b> type <b>B,</b> but they know the health risks. During the research investigation, we also have found out that the citizens do not use their own personal hygiene products, and that the citizens of České Budějovice use the protective means more often than the citizens of Pelhřimov. <b>Hepatitis</b> type <b>B</b> is a serious and complicated illness, which daily threatens all the citizens. With respect to the results of the research, it is important that the citizens get more information on <b>Hepatitis</b> type <b>B,</b> especially on the vaccination possibility, about using only ones own personal hygiene products and using preservatives and rubber medical gloves in risk situations. The citizens could acquire the information from this bachelor thesis or from the seminars lead by general nurses...|$|R
5|$|All {{those with}} a risk of {{exposure}} to body fluids such as blood should be vaccinated, if not already.

5|$|Co-evolution {{hypothesis}} : This is {{also called}} the virus-first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid {{at the same time}} as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E

Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E

Three such cases are described to illustrate that the disease is clinically indistinguishable from <b>hepatitis</b> A or <b>B.</b> The diagnosis is based on the absence of serologic markers of <b>hepatitis</b> A and <b>B</b> and of infection by Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, or on serologic evidence of previous infection with <b>hepatitis</b> A and <b>B...</b>|$|R

5|$|Hermética's last {{concert was}} held in Mar del Plata. Their second concert in Obras was canceled; rumors that Iorio had {{contracted}} <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> {{turned out to be}} false. The other members sent him a formal request to attend the concert but Iorio refused and the band broke up. Iorio did not attend any meeting since then and ordered the other band members to stop using the name Hermética, which Iorio had invented. Iorio gave his first interviews after the break-up to the Clarín newspaper and the other members to the music magazine Madhouse. Iorio said that the band had always been united, but few weeks before their final concert, the members were not talking to each other. He said he had lied about having <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B,</b> expecting to end the hostilities, but it did not work. Iorio flew from Mar del Plata to Buenos Aires to avoid seeing the other members, who returned by bus. O'Connor, Romano, and Strunz stated in Madhouse magazine that the harsh relation was because Iorio had not consulted the others about the decisions he was making, that he received most of the money, and that he avoided meeting them when they were discussing the problems in the band.|$|E
