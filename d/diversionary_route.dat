5|$|With Pick {{wanting to}} abandon freight {{services}} and seeing no {{future for the}} extremities of the former Metropolitan Railway as passenger routes, the LPTB decided to abandon all passenger services beyond Aylesbury. All services on the Brill Tramway were officially withdrawn on 1 December 1935, with the last trains running on 30 November. While services were withdrawn completely from the Brill Tramway, the LPTB considered the Verney Junction branch as having a use as a freight line and as a <b>diversionary</b> <b>route,</b> and continued to maintain the line and to operate freight services until 6 September 1947.|$|E

This <b>diversionary</b> <b>route</b> will be electrified {{as part of the}} transpennine electrification scheme, to be completed by December 2018.|$|E
25|$|The train {{had been}} {{diverted}} from its usual route because of engineering {{work on the}} East Coast Main Line. A conductor driver had taken the controls of the locomotive, an English Electric Type 4, because the regular driver {{did not know the}} <b>diversionary</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Gotthard Base Tunnel {{opened in}} 2016, and the Ceneri Base Tunnel is now {{set to open}} in 2020. After they have opened, all rail traffic will still {{need to use the}} {{existing}} route north of Erstfeld, between Biasca and Bellinzona, and south of Lugano. The bypassed sections of the existing route will be retained for local passenger services, for general capacity and as a <b>diversionary</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Marshgate Junction (Doncaster) to Colton Junction (York) (two-track) When {{signalling}} renewals are due, bi-directional signalling {{and associated}} works over this section should be introduced. Additionally, opportunities {{to enhance the}} various <b>diversionary</b> <b>routes</b> should be examined.|$|R
25|$|More {{recently}} the line has experienced an upturn in fortunes. Eight formerly closed stations have reopened and passenger levels have increased significantly since the 1980s, with 1.2 million passengers recorded in 2012. Ribblehead station features a special visitor centre. The line {{is an important}} <b>diversionary</b> <b>route</b> from the electrified West Coast Main Line during engineering works. However, as the line is not electrified, electric trains such as Pendolinos need to be hauled by diesel locomotives (typically a Class 57 Thunderbird) along the diversion section.|$|E
25|$|The {{full report}} {{disclosed}} that the minimum cost of reinstatement would be £141.0m for single track. Intermediate stations at Isfield and Barcombe would add £7.4m, and double tracking would add £25.5m, both options together would add £38.8m. It was estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 trips per day (450,000 to 620,000 trips per annum) would be {{generated by a}} variety of routes including London-Uckfield-Eastbourne and London-Uckfield-Newhaven fast services. The majority of trips would, however, be to existing stations on the Uckfield Line and the new routes would encourage only 2% growth for existing lines due to longer journey time to the south coast compared with the Brighton Main Line. The benefit of the reinstated line as a <b>diversionary</b> <b>route</b> was also judged negligible due to the low occurrence of total closures on the Brighton line.|$|E
500|$|Quainton Road {{remained}} open, {{but with}} {{the closure of the}} Brill Tramway it was no longer a significant junction. A connection between the GCR and the former Buckinghamshire Railway at Calvert was opened in 1942, leaving the A route to Verney Junction with no purpose other than as a <b>diversionary</b> <b>route.</b> It was closed to passengers on 6 July 1936. London Transport passenger services beyond Aylesbury were withdrawn, leaving the former GCR (part of the London and North Eastern Railway after 1923) as the only [...] passenger services to Quainton Road.|$|E
50|$|Three of the schemes also link {{currently}} separate {{parts of}} the network, Leicester - Burton, Washington (Leamside Line) and Brownhills (Walsall - Lichfield line), bringing possible additional benefits for freight traffic and provision of <b>diversionary</b> <b>routes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Marshgate Junction (Doncaster) to Whitehall Junction (Leeds) (two-track) When {{signalling}} renewals are due, bi-directional signalling {{and associated}} works over this section should be introduced. Additionally, opportunities {{to enhance the}} <b>diversionary</b> <b>routes</b> (via Hambleton Junction or Normanton) should be examined.|$|R
5000|$|Four-track {{sections}} where {{lines are}} paired by direction without any <b>diversionary</b> <b>routes</b> The prime example given is Langley Junction to Hitchin Cambridge Junction. When signalling renewals are due, install bidirectional signalling allowing {{some level of}} service to be retained using a pair of lines during engineering/disruption.|$|R
500|$|Support for the {{reconstruction}} of the [...] to Carlisle was given by Alex Salmond, then First Minister of Scotland, in April 2014. The comment was given as part of a speech in Carlisle {{in the run-up to the}} Scottish independence referendum. Reinstating the line would not only provide an opportunity to access the vast areas of forestry land around Kielder, but also provide a strategic <b>diversionary</b> <b>route</b> in the event of closure of the East Coast or West Coast Main Lines. Calls for the line's reopening have also come from the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Select Committee. Transport Scotland has ruled out a [...] extension of the line from Tweedbank to Hawick in favour of connecting bus services and improved cycling and walking routes.|$|E
500|$|Until the Severn Road Bridge {{was opened}} in 1966, the Severn Railway Bridge was often {{referred}} to as the Severn Bridge. [...] There was a small station known as [...] on the Lydney side, adjacent to the Gloucester to Newport Line, which the Severn Bridge Line crossed over. The bridge was used as a <b>diversionary</b> <b>route</b> for passenger services when the Severn Tunnel was closed for engineering work. The south-to-north chord at Berkeley Loop South Junction used for this route was closed when the bridge was abandoned. The remaining line from Berkeley Rd Junction to Sharpness Docks remains and on the north side of the Severn estuary, the line from the former Otters Pool Junction at Lydney to the Severn Bridge has long been lifted but a short section of the track exists as part of the Forest of Dean Railway network.|$|E
500|$|Frank Pick, Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, {{aimed to}} move the network away from freight {{services}} and saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes, concluding that over £2000 (about £ in [...] ) would be saved by closing the Brill Tramway. As a consequence, the LPTB decided to abandon all passenger services beyond Aylesbury. The Brill Tramway was closed on 1 December 1935, with the last trains running on 30 November. Services on the Brill Tramway were withdrawn completely following the transfer to public ownership; the LPTB considered the Verney Junction branch as having a use as a freight line and as a <b>diversionary</b> <b>route,</b> and they continued to maintain the line and operate freight services until 6 September 1947.|$|E
2500|$|The zone covers most of Greater London (with minor {{deviations}} {{to allow}} <b>diversionary</b> <b>routes</b> and facilities {{to turn around}} without entering the zone and the M25 motorway). The boundary of the zone, which operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, is marked by signs. The LEZ emissions standards are based on European emission standards relating to particulate matter (PM), which are emitted by vehicles, which {{have an effect on}} health. The following vehicles are not charged: ...|$|R
25|$|Diversion routes {{are marked}} with black symbols on a yellow patch (square, triangle, circle, or diamond). These mark <b>diversionary</b> <b>routes</b> {{in the event}} that the road ahead is closed for any reasons. Motorists can {{navigate}} following the symbol, and can find their way back to the original road at a junction above the closure. The four symbols may be filled (solid) or outlines. They are most commonly placed on directional signs, following the route number (e.g. A 25) but may be free standing.|$|R
5000|$|The planned {{congestion}} charge scheme {{would be in}} place by 2013. An anticipated reduction of 10-15% {{in the number of}} cars entering the charging zone was expected to both reduce congestion, and decrease journey times. [...] A traffic information and control system would be installed along all of the major routes into Manchester city centre, to monitor incidents, and provide information on problems and <b>diversionary</b> <b>routes.</b> [...] There would be improved park and ride facilities, including new sites on many of the Metrolink extensions and the Leigh-Manchester bus route.|$|R
2500|$|The Lisburn-Antrim railway line {{is still}} maintained, and {{occasional}} crew training operations are performed. [...] While {{it is also}} available as a <b>diversionary</b> <b>route,</b> Knockmore, Ballinderry, Glenavy and Crumlin stations have closed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, closure notices {{were posted}} at the S's {{remaining}} stations. However, {{local authorities and}} rail enthusiasts joined together and campaigned to save the S, pointing out that British Rail was ignoring the S's potential for tourism, ignoring {{the need for a}} <b>diversionary</b> <b>route</b> to the West Coast main line, and failing to promote through traffic from the Midlands and Yorkshire to Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|The line to [...] {{closed on}} 2 February 1970 and its tracks were lifted the {{following}} year. [...] The disused formation is still visible, though the A629 bypass road occupies a short section immediately {{west of the}} former junction with the line to Carlisle & Lancaster. An organisation called SELRAP is campaigning for the re-instatement of the link and runs occasional charter trains between the two stations, using a long <b>diversionary</b> <b>route</b> {{to point out the}} eleven mile [...] "missing link." ...|$|E

5000|$|At first, Karnazes ran direct routes {{from school}} to his home. Later, he began to run <b>diversionary</b> <b>routes</b> that would extend his run and take him into uncharted territory. [...] By third grade, he was {{participating}} in and organizing short running events with other children. As Karnazes grew older, he began testing his limits: by age eleven he had hiked rim-to-rim across the Grand Canyon and had climbed Mount Whitney, the highest mountain in the contiguous United States; for his 12th birthday, he cycled 40 mi to his grandparents' home for fun without telling his parents.|$|R
50|$|When in October 2004, {{major roads}} works {{were carried out}} between Enzisreute and Ravensburg, the {{importance}} of the B30 as a major traffic artery became apparent. <b>Diversionary</b> <b>routes</b> up to 60 km were necessary that had to split into two different routes. On {{the first day of the}} road works, there were traffic jams of more than 4 km at the exits leading to the diversions. On the diversions themselves, traffic collapsed completely at times. The raof works enabled the inhabitants of Gasibeuren to measure the width of the B30, showing that the road in Gaisbeuren is up to 16 m wide.|$|R
2500|$|The Golden Valley Line {{serves as}} a diversionary line for several other lines in the area as well as serving its normal traffic. It {{will be a major}} <b>diversionary</b> <b>route</b> during the {{electrification}} of the Great Western main line. The line between Swindon and Kemble was reduced to a single track in 1968, limiting its capacity. In his March 2011 Budget, the Chancellor George Osborne approved a project to re-double this section of line, after several years of campaigning by local politicians. [...] The scheme was completed in August 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Services on {{this line}} began when London and North Western Railway (LNWR) {{completed}} the Camden to Watford Junction new line in 1912, {{to provide additional}} suburban capacity and more outer-suburban services running non-stop to Euston. [...] It incorporated part of the LNWR Rickmansworth branch (formerly the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway) between Watford Junction and Watford High Street Junction {{and part of the}} original slow main line between Queen's Park and South Hampstead stations; two single-track tunnels take the line from South Hampstead to Camden, whence the line reaches Euston station by the main-line tracks. [...] Prior to 1912, at which time the entire route was finally electrified, services were steam operated. Although the operation of the line is mostly self-contained, connections at Watford Junction and Camden allow other trains onto it, a facility used occasionally with trains diverted from the West Coast Main Line should an alternative <b>diversionary</b> <b>route</b> be not available.|$|E
2500|$|Speculation {{remains that}} the Lisburn-Antrim route could re-open, {{potentially}} {{to offer an}} alternative Antrim – Lisburn – Belfast service. The line is maintained both for crew training and as a <b>diversionary</b> <b>route,</b> and passes close to Belfast International Airport at Aldergrove. For {{a number of years}} there have been suggestions for a station to serve the airport. The airport has marked the building of a new station in its list of future plans, while EasyJet, which is the largest operator into Belfast International, have been strong in advocating an airport rail link. The reopening of the Lisburn-Antrim line is seen not simply in terms of provision of a link to the airport – it would also allow for the further economic development of the area, which has seen increases in population as people use the towns in South Antrim as dormitory settlements for Belfast. In May 2009, the Minister for Regional Development stated that a proposal had been received from a private developer, the Kilbride Group, to restore the Knockmore line, indicating that he would be prepared to part fund a study into this if the local authorities provided the rest of the funding. The route was also included in a wider study of the development of the Northern Rail Corridor published at the end of 2009 ...|$|E
5000|$|The ATOC {{report also}} {{identified}} 16 potential 'link lines' {{on the existing}} rail network where new services could be run as part of National Rail services, {{but not with the}} primary purpose of opening new stations. These would bring the benefit of providing new journey opportunities for passengers, as well as more options for <b>diversionary</b> <b>routes</b> for traffic on the national network. None of these would provide new stations for populations over 15,000, and as such none of the link lines were evaluated for a specific benefit-cost ratio (BCR), but were evaluated as physically feasible. The links identified were as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Although this {{electrification}} {{scheme and}} associated works {{has come to}} mean Edinburgh -Glasgow via Falkirk High due to be complete by December 2016, the rolling programme will then follow with the route via Shotts. The scheme via Carstairs {{in association with the}} ECML electrification was completed in the early 1990s. With other infills in the central belt of Scotland there will soon be 4 different electrified routes between the two cities with assorted <b>diversionary</b> <b>routes.</b> The December 2016 date was not met and in May 2017 a further delay to the wires going live was announced due to a safety critical component possibly for the whole route needing to be replaced.|$|R
2500|$|When the West Coast Main Line was {{upgraded}} by Network Rail in the 2000s, {{it became}} necessary to operate <b>diversionary</b> <b>routes</b> whilst work was going on. As a result, Midland Mainline {{was asked by}} the then Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) to operate services between London and Manchester via the Midland Main Line and Hope Valley Line into [...] while West Coast Main Line renovation works took place. In a temporary operation dubbed Project Rio, {{a large percentage of the}} stored Virgin CrossCountry power cars were overhauled and returned to service in an enlarged Midland Mainline fleet. Ending on 10 September 2004, the Project Rio fleet was gradually disbanded, with power cars moving to First Great Western, GNER or CrossCountry.|$|R
