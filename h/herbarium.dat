5|$|An {{extensive}} {{collection of}} living and dried plants was returned to Paris by Delahaye but these were scattered after his death, <b>herbarium</b> specimens now being housed in Paris, Geneva, Mauritius and Java. His original <b>herbarium</b> of 2,699 plants included specimens dated and numbered in his journal as follows: New Ireland (Bismarck Archipelago, Jul 17–24 1792, collection numbers 699-786); Ambon (Sept 6 – Oct 12, 1792, nos. 787-1113), Boeroe (Sept3–5, 1793, nos 1517-1669), Sourabaya, East Java (Oct 29 1793–Aug 1794, nos 1670-1962), Java (from 1794–96, nos 1963-2296), Batavia, west Java (Jun 1796–Jan 1797, nos 2297-2419) and the remainder from Isle de France.|$|E

5|$|The first <b>herbarium</b> {{collection}} of B.epica {{was not made}} until October 1973, when Ernest Charles Nelson visited Toolinna Cove to collect specimens for a taxonomic revision of Adenanthos. Nelson was stimulated to make that revision from {{an interest in the}} problem of disjunct plant distributions in southern Australia, and therefore collected specimens of a range of plant species. On 22 October, he collected a specimen of B.epica in old flower, but incorrectly identified it as B.media, and later lodged it in the <b>herbarium</b> at Canberra under that name.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving to}} London, Stearn {{produced}} a steady output of publications {{during his years}} at the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library (1933–1952). These covered {{a wide range of}} topics from bibliography to plant nomenclature, taxonomy and garden plants, with a particular emphasis on Vinca, Epimedium and Lilium. Within two years of joining the Library in 1933, he had produced his first major monograph, Lilies (1935), in collaboration with Drysdale Woodcock and John Coutts. This text, in an expanded and revised edition, as Woodcock and Stearn's Lilies of the World (1950) became a standard work on the Liliaceae sensu lato. While at the Library he also continued his collaboration with his Cambridge colleagues, publishing catalogues of the <b>Herbarium</b> collections, including the Catalogue of the Collections of the <b>Herbarium</b> of the University Botany School, Cambridge (1935). The second task imposed on him at this time involved the RHS role in maintaining revision of the Code of Botanical Nomenclature (see Botanical taxonomy).|$|E
5|$|After {{turning over}} his non-research duties to Sargent, Goodale, Farlow, and Watson, Gray {{concentrated}} more {{on research and}} writing, especially on plant taxonomy, as well as lecturing around the country, largely promoting Darwinian ideas. Many of his lectures during this time were given at the Yale Divinity School. Liberty Hyde Bailey worked as Gray's <b>herbarium</b> assistant for two years during 1883–1884.|$|E

5|$|Delahaye {{was one of}} many gardener-botanists {{employed}} on European colonial voyages {{of scientific}} exploration in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Their duty was to assist with the collection, transport, cultivation and distribution of economic plants. They worked with the naturalists on these expeditions, but gave particular assistance to the botanists by collecting live plants and seed, as well as plant specimens for <b>herbarium</b> collections. They often maintained journals and records of their collections and made observations on the vegetation encountered during the voyage. On this particular expedition, Delahaye assisted the naturalist and botanist Jacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardière—who accumulated one of the largest <b>herbarium</b> collections of that era and published what was, in effect, the first Flora of Australia based on the collections he made on the New Holland (Australian) leg of the expedition. Delahaye also made numerous botanical collections of his own.|$|E
5|$|Despite Gray {{constantly}} seeking {{collectors and}} {{people to help}} him with the Harvard <b>herbarium,</b> in the first fifteen years he was at Harvard, no graduate entered botany as a career. This changed in 1858 with the arrival of Daniel Cady Eaton, who had graduated from Yale University in 1857 and came to Harvard to study with Gray. Eaton later returned to Yale to be a botany professor and oversee its <b>herbarium,</b> just as Gray did at Harvard. Daniel Eaton was the grandson of Amos Eaton, whose textbooks Gray had studied during his college days. Eaton influenced the teaching style of Gray, and both required practical work of their students. Gray retained the Fisher post until 1873 while living in the Asa Gray House.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson's <b>herbarium,</b> {{which is}} now held in the Houghton Library at Harvard University, was {{published}} in 2006 as Emily Dickinson's <b>Herbarium</b> by Harvard University Press. The original work was compiled by Dickinson during her years at Amherst Academy, and consists of 424 pressed specimens of plants arranged on 66 pages of a bound album. A digital facsimile of the <b>herbarium</b> is available online. The town of Amherst Jones Library's Special Collections department has an Emily Dickinson Collection consisting of approximately seven thousand items, including original manuscript poems and letters, family correspondence, scholarly articles and books, newspaper clippings, theses, plays, photographs and contemporary artwork and prints. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College has substantial holdings of Dickinson's manuscripts and letters {{as well as a}} lock of Dickinson's hair and the original of the only positively identified image of the poet. In 1965, in recognition of Dickinson's growing stature as a poet, the Homestead was purchased by Amherst College. It opened to the public for tours, and also served as a faculty residence for many years. The Emily Dickinson Museum was created in 2003 when ownership of the Evergreens, which had been occupied by Dickinson family heirs until 1988, was transferred to the college.|$|E
50|$|The {{index was}} {{originally}} {{published by the}} International Association for Plant Taxonomy, which sponsored the first six editions (1952-1974); subsequently the New York Botanical Garden took over {{the responsibility for the}} index. The Index provides the supporting institution's name (often a university, botanical garden, or not-for-profit organization) its city and state, each <b>herbarium's</b> acronym, along with contact information for staff members along with their research specialties and the important holdings of each <b>herbarium's</b> collection.|$|R

5|$|His work at Hartekamp led {{to another}} book, , a {{catalogue}} of the botanical holdings in the <b>herbarium</b> and botanical garden of Hartekamp. He wrote it in nine months (completed in July 1737), {{but it was not}} published until 1738. It contains the first use of the name Nepenthes, which Linnaeus used to describe a genus of pitcher plants.|$|E
5|$|In 1859 Gray {{was elected}} a foreign {{member of the}} Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Sciences was created by Congress on March3, 1863, {{and he was one}} of the {{original}} 50 members. In 1864 Gray donated 200,000 plant specimens and 2,200 books to Harvard with the condition that the <b>herbarium</b> and garden be built. This effectively created the botany department at Harvard, and the Gray <b>Herbarium</b> was named after him. He was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1872 and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 1863–1873. Gray was also a regent at the Smithsonian Institution in 1874–1888 and a foreign member of the Royal Society of London in 1873.|$|E

50|$|Short owned a botanical {{collection}} with 15,000 plant samples. In his will, {{he requested}} {{that it be}} donated to the Smithsonian Institution. However, {{it was given to}} the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. An 1865 book said that the botanical collection {{was one of the most}} valuable private <b>herbariums</b> in the world. The book also stated that it was one of the most complete <b>herbariums</b> in the United States. Additionally, after retiring, Short owned a garden that spanned several acres.|$|R

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by American mycologists Alexander H. Smith and Harry D. Thiers in their 1978 monograph on the boletes of Michigan. The type collection {{was made by}} Smith near Ann Arbor, and is stored at the University of Michigan <b>Herbarium.</b> The specific epithet rubroflammeus derives from the Latin words ruber ("red") and flammeus ("flaming").|$|E
5|$|While {{working at}} the {{bookshop}} he made many friends amongst the Cambridge botanists and participated in their activities, including botanical excursions. In addition to Professor Seward, those influencing him included the morphologist Agnes Arber, Humphrey Gilbert-Carter the first scientific director of the Botanic Garden, John Gilmour then curator of the university <b>herbarium</b> and later director of the Garden (1951–1973), the horticulturalist E. A. Bowles (1865–1954), who became his patron, Harry Godwin, then a research fellow and later professor and Tom Tutin who was working with Seward at that time. Seward gave him full research facilities in the <b>herbarium.</b> He continued his research, visiting the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, in 1930, {{at the age of}} 19, and also spent two weeks at the <b>herbarium</b> of the Musée National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, {{with the aid of a}} £15 grant from the Royal Society to study Epimedium. Also in 1930, the Fifth International Botanical Congress was held at Cambridge, and Stearn was able to attend this. During this time he commuted between the bookshop, the Botany School, Botanic Garden and home by bicycle, his preferred means of transportation throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|At the time, no type {{specimen}} was specified, as the practice only arose later, in the 19th century. When a lectotype (type selected amongst original material) was designated, it {{was assigned to}} specimen 242.1 of Linnaeus' <b>herbarium,</b> the only V.thapsus specimen. The species had previously been designated as type species for Verbascum. European plants exhibit considerable phenotypical variation, {{which has led to}} the plant acquiring many synonyms over the years. Introduced American populations show much less variation.|$|E
50|$|Miriquidica deusta is {{a species}} of lichen in the Lecanoraceae family. A North American native, it {{generally}} grows on siliceous rocks. It belongs to the Ascomycota division and Pezizomycotina subdivision, and to the Lecanorales order. These are found in both general and Estonian <b>herbariums.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{noteworthy}} {{collection of}} the botanical museum is that of botanical illustration, and in particular, painted <b>herbariums</b> (Herbiers peints), dating from the late 18th century to the present day. Works by botanical illustrators include those by Rosalie de Constant (1758-1834), Marie Mousson (1805-1895), Mary Grierson (born 1912).|$|R
50|$|Noltie {{noted in}} Bot.
