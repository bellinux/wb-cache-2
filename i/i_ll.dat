Keeping on this analogy, Ehrhard and Regnier introduced Differential Linear Logic (D <b>I</b> <b>LL)</b> — an extension of Multiplicative Exponential Linear Logic with differential constructions. In this setting, promotion (the logical exponentiation) can be approximated by a sum of promotion- free proofs of D <b>I</b> <b>LL,</b> via Taylor expansion.

Precisely, we deﬁne merging reduction — a rewriting system which merges a ﬁnite sum of D <b>I</b> <b>LL</b> proofs into a proof with promotion whenever the sum is an approximation of the Taylor expansion of this proof.

5000|$|At {{least since}} the days of Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson, {{analysis}} of the play has centred on the question of Macbeth's ambition, commonly seen as so dominant a trait that it defines the character. Johnson asserted that Macbeth, though esteemed for his military bravery, is wholly reviled. This opinion recurs in critical literature, and, according to Caroline Spurgeon, is supported by Shakespeare himself, who apparently intended to degrade his hero by vesting him with clothes unsuited to him and to make Macbeth look ridiculous by several nimisms he applies: His garments seem either too big or too small for him - as his ambition is too big and his character too small for his new and unrightful role as king. When he feels as if [...] "dressed in borrowed robes", after his new title as Thane of Cawdor, prophesied by the witches, has been confirmed by Ross (<b>I,</b> 3, <b>ll.</b> 108-09), Banquo comments: [...] "New honours come upon him, / Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould, / But with the aid of use" [...] (<b>I,</b> 3, <b>ll.</b> 145-46). And, at the end, when the tyrant is at bay at Dunsinane, Caithness sees him as a man trying in vain to fasten a large garment on him with too small a belt: [...] "He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause / Within the belt of rule" [...] (V, 2, ll. 14-15), while Angus, in a similar nimism, sums up what everybody thinks ever since Macbeth's accession to power: [...] "now does he feel his title / Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe / upon a dwarfish thief" [...] (V, 2, ll. 18-20).|$|R

40|$|In this paper, network flow {{algorithms}} for bipartite {{networks are}} studied. A network G = (V. E) is called bipartite if its vertex set V can be partitioned into two subsets V 1 and V 2 such that all edges have one endpoint in VY {{and the other}} in V 2. Let n = <b>I.,</b> nl = <b>ll</b> <b>I</b> 1, n = IV 21, m = El and assume without loss of generality that n s < n 2. A bipartite network is called unbalanced if n << n and balanced otherwise. (This notion is necessarily imprecise.) It is shown that several maximum flow algorithms can be substantially sped up when applied to unbalanced networks. The basic idea in these improvements is a ntwo-edge push rule that allows one to &quot;charge&quot; most computation to vertices in VI, and hence develop algorithms whose running times depend on n rather than n. For example, it is shown that the two-edge push version of Goldberg and Tarjan's FIFO preflow-push algorithm runs in O(nlm + n 3) time and that the analogous version of Ahuja and Orlin's excess scaling algorithm runs in O(n m + n log U) time, where U is the largest edge capacity.
