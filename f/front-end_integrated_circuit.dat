Circuit models for transducer elements in ultrasonic arrays have {{to account for}} the coupling effect for an accurate representation of their radiation impedance. In this paper, we present a circuit model for the cross-coupling effects among capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (cMUT) elements. Using the finite element method (FEM) we first show that the mutual radiation impedance of cMUT cells with a physical distance much smaller that the acoustic wavelength obey the analytic results derived for plane piston transducers. Then, we show that this mutual impedance can be modeled by an electrical RLC tank circuit suitable to be used in general circuit simulators.

In order to implement this frontend, an EM simulation based device modeling methodology together with the corresponding design flow has been proposed, which is tailored for the specific 65 nm CMOS design kits and the available simulation tool. Based on thorough analysis of the process feature, efforts on device modeling for 60 GHz operation have been taken. For active device, an EM model, using exiting transistor compact model as core, is developed for the NFET valid in vicinity of 60 GHz to account for parasitic elements due to wiring stacks. Solutions for implementing the passive components in the specific circuit blocks have been illustrated. In particular, constructing, optimizing and physically characterizing of spiral inductor operating around 60 GHz frequency band has been demonstrated.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Fabrication {{techniques}} and process integration considerations for amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) thin-film transistors (TFTs) constitute {{the central theme}} of this dissertation. Within this theme three primary areas of focus are pursued. The first focus involves formulating a general framework for assessing passivation. Avoiding formation of an undesirable backside accumulation layer in an AOS bottom-gate TFT is accomplished by (i) choosing a passivation layer in which the charge neutrality level is aligned with (ideal case) or higher in energy {{than that of the}} semiconductor channel layer charge neutrality level, and (ii) depositing the passivation layer in such a manner that a negligible density of oxygen vacancies are present at the channel-passivation layer interface. Two AOS TFT passivation schemes are explored. Sputter-deposited zinc tin silicon oxide (ZTSO) appears promising for suppressing the effects of negative bias illumination stress (NBIS) with respect to ZTO and IGZO TFTs. Solution-deposited silicon dioxide is used as a barrier layer to subsequent PECVD silicon dioxide deposition, yielding ZTO TFT transfer curves showing that the dual-layer passivation process does not significantly alter ZTO TFT electrical characteristics. The second focus involves creating an adaptable back-end process compatible with flexible substrates. A detailed list of possible via formation techniques is presented with particular focus on non-traditional and adaptable techniques. Two of the discussed methods, "hydrophobic surface treatment" and "printed local insulator," are demonstrated and proven effective. The third focus is printing AOS TFT channel layers in order to create an adaptable and additive <b>front-end</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> fabrication scheme. Printed zinc indium aluminum oxide (ZIAO) and indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) channel layers are demonstrated using a SonoPlot piezoelectric printing system. Finally, challenges associated with printing electronic materials are discussed. Organic-based solutions are easier to print due to their ability to "stick" to the substrate and form well-defined patterns, but have poor electrical characteristics due to the weakness of organic bonds. Inorganic aqueous-based solutions demonstrate good electrical performance when deposited by spin coating, but are difficult to print because precise control of a substrate's hydrophillic/hydrophobic nature is required. However, precise control is difficult to achieve, since aqueous-based solutions either spread out or ball up on the substrate surface. Thickness control of any printed solution is always problematic due to surface wetting and the elliptical thickness profile of a dispensed solution...|$|E
40|$|Motivation/Background: <b>Front-end</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> {{design for}} 2 D {{ultrasonic}} array elements is challenging due to reduced element sensitivity. The pulse driver and return echo amplifier circuits can be optimized {{by the use}} of a precise circuit model of the transducer array at the design stage. An equivalent circuit that models transmit and receive operations of the array enables the matching of the IC to the transducer. This helps the designer to optimize the front-end IC before fabrication. Statement of the Contribution/Methods: In this paper, we present an equivalent circuit model for a 2 D CMUT array element to asses the overall pulse-echo behavior. The circuit is {{a modified version of the}} conventional model in which the radiation term in the Mason equivalent circuit has been replaced by an RLC network to model the finite size of the transducer. The new circuit includes (i) an RC network to model the frequency dependent diffraction losses and attenuation in the transmitted and reflected acoustic waves, (ii) transmission lines for propagation delays, (iii) a VCVS to model the reflection from the imaging surface (which is the oil-air interface in our experiments). Component values of this model circuit were calculated using analytic expressions for the electro mechanic transformer ratio of CMUTs, based on the work in [1] and [2]. Pulse-echo measurements were carried out using a front-end IC designed in AustriaMicroSystems H 35 high-voltage CMOS technology. An array element of 14 × 14 CMUT elements of 20 µm radius and 1 µm membrane thickness was wire-bonded to the IC. The resulting pulse and pulse echo response responses were then compared to the simulation results based on the developed model. Results: The equivalent circuit model was verified by running simulations on Cadence Spectre. The post-layout extracted netlist of the IC is combined with the proposed equivalent circuit that models the wire bonded array elements. The elements were fired with a unipolar pulse of 20 Volts and the signal at the amplifier output was than compared to the experimental data. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the experimental data and simulation result. Discussion and Conclusions: We demonstrated that the information obtained from the pulse-echo model is consistent with experimental results and can be used for further IC designs to enhance overall system performance.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Front-end</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> for signal {{processing}} {{are useful in}} neuronal recording systems that engage {{a large number of}} electrodes. Detection, alignment, and sorting of the spike data at the frontend reduces the data bandwidth and enables wireless communication. Without such data reduction, large data volumes need to be transferred to a host computer and typically heavy cables are required which constrain the patient or test animal. We explore Neuroprocessor electronic chips for portable applications. The Neuroprocessor can be placed next to the recording electrodes and provide for all stages of spike processing, stimulating neuronal tissues and wireless communication to a host computer. It can dissipate only a limited amount of power, due to supply constraints and heat restrictions. We introduce hardware architectures for automatic spike sorting algorithms in Neuroprocessors, designed for low power. Some of the algorithms are based on principal component analysis. Others employ a novel Integral Transform analysis and achieve 98 % of the precision of a PCA sorter, while requiring only 2. 5 % of the computational complexity.

Abstract The recent {{release of the}} unlicensed 60 GHz band tackles the increasing demand for more bandwidth in the wireless consumer electronics market. In {{order to meet the}} cost require-ments of this market, many research groups have worked towards 60 GHz front-end elec-tronics in mainstream silicon technologies, i. e., CMOS and BiCMOS. However, the tech-nology choice for suitable antennas has not been as unitary and is controversially discussed. While there is a wide consensus that the antenna should be integrated in the same package with the <b>front-end</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> (IC), there are three main approaches on the realiza-tion. First, there is the Antenna-in- Package approach, in which the antenna is implemented in the IC's packaging technology. Second, there is the Antenna-on-Chip approach, in which the antenna is directly implemented in the back-end of the IC. Finally, the third approach can be considered as a hybrid of Antenna-on-Chip and Antenna-in-Package, in which the feed-point of the antenna is implemented on-chip while the radiating element itself is real-ized off-chip. This thesis focuses Antenna-on chip main integration strategies. Its goal is to explore the challenges and potentials of this technology with respect to millimeter-wave antenna inte-gration. For this, integrated antenna concepts for the 60 GHz band are developed using mainstream technologies. This restriction is necessary in order to achieve cost-effective solutions for the highly price-competitive wireless consumer electronics market. The main challenge of antenna design in a planar technology is the trade-off between radiation effi-ciency and bandwidth. To obtain a large bandwidth, a relatively thick dielectric layer is needed. However, a thicker dielectric layer introduces more losses due to surface-wave excitation in the dielectric. Silicon with low resistivity substrates also introduce special challenges for high efficiency millimeter wave on-chip antennas. First, their low resistivity of 0. 1 - 20 [omega]-cm results in high dielectric loss and significantly reduces the antenna effi-ciency. Second, TE and TM surface waves are easily triggered in 200 - 500 [mu]m thick silicon substrates and can have serious detrimental effects on the antenna pattern and efficiency. A lot of work has been done to improve the radiation efficiency of planar antennas while maintaining a large bandwidth. Particularly, the use of electromagnetic band gap (EBG) materials that suppress the surface-wave excitation has received a lot of attention. How-ever, EBG materials are either difficult to manufacture, or too large to be used in planar array configurations. Another approach to improve the radiation efficiency is presented in literatures, where a superstrate antenna is used. This solution shows good perfor-mance. But careful consideration reveals that most designs are not readily amenable to mass production and many purposed structures are very inefficient. Some designs which are efficient require extra process steps such as trenching. This extra process hinders to achieve truly low fabrication cost. The fabrication process should be fully compatible with current substrate processing technology. To tackle these challenges, antenna on chip (AOC) structures, named virtual loop antenna (VLA) structures, were studied and utilized for low profile Si CMOS on-chip antenna de-sign and realization. The concept proposed in this work avoids the extra steps but provides for comparable good antenna efficiency. We propose the design of this antenna for use on CMOS ICs technology that promises to integrate a complete 60 GHz system on single chip that combines a good performance in both bandwidth and radiation efficiency. The result-ing design is completely planar, and the use of vias is avoided. This result in inherently low fabrication cost, light weight, and low volume antenna. Its design is essentially a joint op-timization of bandwidth and power efficiency. The design of this integrated loop antenna for use on 60 GHz CMOS receivers was based on silicon substrates of low resistivity that varies from 5 - 20 [omega]-cm. The design was based on intensive electromagnetic simulations using HFSS software package. The width and length of the antenna is less than half a free-space wavelength, such that the antenna can be readily used for the realization of a plana...|$|E

In addition, an ultralow-power low-noise amplifier architecture is proposed to increase the power efficiency of the RX circuitry. The ASIC has a compact element matched layout and consumes only 0. 27 mW/channel while receiving, which is lower than the state-of-the-art circuit. Its functionality has been successfully demonstrated in 3 -D imaging experiments. </p...|$|R

To make rapid {{implementation}} and verification for the systems becomes important in <b>front–end</b> Application Specific <b>Integrated</b> <b>Circuits.</b> Therefore, a field {{programmable gate array}} based hardware/software codesign prototyping environment is proposed to simulate the software {{implementation and}} verify the hardware implementation of a baseband OFDM system.

40|$|Laser {{detection}} and ranging (LADAR) systems {{are commonly used}} to acquire real-time three-dimensional (3 D) images using the time-of-flight of a short laser pulse. A static unitary detector (STUD) -based LADAR system is a simple method for obtaining real-time high-resolution 3 D images. In this study, a switched 4 -to- 1 transimpedance combining amplifier (TCA) is implemented as a receiver <b>front-end</b> readout <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> for the STUD-based LADAR system. The 4 -to- 1 TCA is fabricated using a standard 0. 18 μm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, and it consists of four independent current buffers, a two-stage signal combiner, a balun, and an output buffer in one single integrated chip. In addition, there is a switch on each input current path to expand the region of interest with multiple photodetectors. The core of the TCA occupies an area of 92 μm × 68 μm, and the die size including I/O pads is 1000 μm × 840 μm. The power consumption of the fabricated chip is 17. 8 mW for a supplied voltage of 1. 8 V and a transimpedance gain of 67. 5 dBΩ.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents various ?efficient? design {{techniques for}} mm-wave <b>front-end</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> {{in regards to}} dc power, bandwidth, and chip size. The ideas, while suitable for different CMOS/BiCMOS processes, were implemented using a 0. 18 -?m SiGe BiCMOS process. The proposed techniques are validated through the actual implementations of several building blocks constituting two different front-end sections: a V-band OOK/pulse transceiver front-end and a concurrent K-/V-band receiver front-end, where K-band ranges from 18 to 27 GHz and V-band from 40 to 75 GHz. As one of the constituent components in the V-band pulse transmitter, a 60 -GHz active OOK/pulse modulator has been designed {{with an emphasis on}} the enhancement in the ON/OFF isolation. Having a decent gain (higher than 10 dB), the designed modulator can also be used as a driver stage, which can save the chip area and possibly the dc power consumption compared to the combination of a switch-based passive modulator and a drive amplifier. For the receiver front-end, a wideband V-band low-noise amplifier (LNA) has been designed. Employing a wideband gain shaping technique through two T-type inter-stage matching networks, the designed LNA features very high gain-bandwidth product compared to the conventional gain-staggered wideband amplifier designs for a given dc power consumption. For the concurrent K-/V-band receiver front-end, a low-noise and variable gain stages have been designed. As the first component of the receiver chain, a concurrent dual-band LNA has been designed within a similar footprint required for a single-band amplifier operating either at K- or V-band. The most significant direct intermodulation (IM) product and harmonics are suppressed by a simple rejection network between the input and cascode devices of the 1 st stage. This network also plays a crucial role in achieving dual-band input matching through Miller effect. For amplitude control purposes in the RF stage, a variable gain amplifier (VGA) operating concurrently at K- and V-bands has been developed starting from a wideband amplifier design. By replacing the inductors in the wideband design with the transformer-coupled resonators (TCRs), the critical direct IM products can be suppressed without increasing the active chip area. Gain tuning is achieved by conventional current steering, but a new technique is applied to reduce phase variation in the course of gain tuning process, {{which is one of the}} most critical concerns, especially in phased array systems...|$|R
40|$|The NanoStreeM project {{collects}} and summarizes data on nanomaterials {{that come}} or may come {{of interest in}} future manufacturing of semiconductor devices and circuits. The layout and results of a systematic literature survey are {{described in the present}} document. The structured approach starts with the definition of the goals and definition of the research field followed by a delineation against areas that are beyond the scope of the task. In detail, only fabrication processes related to the manufacture or post-processing of silicon <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> are under investigation. Although this field has been adressed by other authors, a thorough study is not existent. After discussing the applicability of available sources, a two-stage strategy is developed for retrieving relevant data. As groundwork, the chapters on Emerging Research Devices and Emerging Research Materials of the meanwhile discontinued International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (2011 version) were used for the retrieval of keywords and the subsequent elaboration of search phrases for an extended literature search on a standard repository. A total of 58 keyword families with numerous variation possibilities were identified. As a compendium offering a thorough overview on the history and future of silicon based devices and respective manufacturing, the proceedings of the IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) from 1954 up to now were chosen. It is assumed that all relevant developments regarding Si related device concepts and processing should have been presented at this conference. Based on this survey, a total of 1080 articles (as of spring 2017) were identified that contain information on the application of nanomaterials in <b>front-end</b> silicon <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> manufacturing. These instances were gathered in a literature database and categorized for further evaluation...|$|R

Composed of 32 channels, it reads out signals in both polarities from {{each side of}} a Silicon strip sensor, 2 mm thick 27 cm long, characterized by a strip capacitance of 30 pF. Each front-end channel provides low-noise charge amplification, shaping with a stabilized baseline, discrimination, and peak detection with an analog memory. The channels can process events simultaneously, and the read out is sparsified. The charge amplifier makes uses a dual-cascode configuration and dual-polarity adaptive reset, The low-hysteresis discriminator and the multi-phase peak detector process signals with a dynamic range in excess of four hundred. An equivalent noise charge (ENC) below 200 electrons was measured at 30 pF, with a slope of about 4. 5 electrons/pF at a peaking time of 4 {micro}s.

The key feature of such Compton telescopes is the high energy resolution that is crucial for high angular resolution and high background rejection capability. The energy resolution around 1 keV is required to approach physical limit of the angular resolution due to Doppler broadening.

40|$|A biopotential {{acquisition}} analog <b>front-end</b> (AFE) <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> (IC) is presented. The biopotential AFE {{includes a}} capacitively coupled chopper instrumentation amplifier (CCIA) to achieve low input referred noise (IRN) and to block unwanted DC potential signals. A DC servo loop (DSL) {{is designed to}} minimize the offset voltage in the chopper amplifier and low frequency respiration artifacts. An AC coupled ripple rejection loop (RRL) is employed to reduce ripple due to chopper stabilization. A capacitive impedance boosting loop (CIBL) is designed to enhance the input impedance and common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) without additional power consumption, even under an external electrode mismatch. The AFE IC consists of two-stage CCIA that include three compensation loops (DSL, RRL, and CIBL) at each CCIA stage. The biopotential AFE is fabricated using a 0. 18 μm one polysilicon and six metal layers (1 P 6 M) {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) process. The core chip size of the AFE without input/output (I/O) pads is 10. 5 mm 2. A fourth-order band-pass filter (BPF) with a pass-band in the band-width from 1 Hz to 100 Hz was integrated to attenuate unwanted signal and noise. The overall gain and band-width are reconfigurable by using programmable capacitors. The IRN is measured to be 0. 94 μVRMS in the pass band. The maximum amplifying gain of the pass-band was measured as 71. 9 dB. The CIBL enhances the CMRR from 57. 9 dB to 67 dB at 60 Hz under electrode mismatch conditions...|$|R
