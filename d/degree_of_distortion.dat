40|$|We {{show that}} in {{principal}} only a small <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> probability <b>distortion</b> is necessary for agents to exhibit the Allais paradox. We also show that the choices observed in the Allais experiments employing small real payoffs cannot be explained by Cumulative Prospect Theory without the assumption <b>of</b> low <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> probability <b>distortion</b> that rule out gambling at unfair odds on {{all but the most}} extreme longshots in CPT.

Replacement of Ba 2 + ions by Sr 2 + ions that are smaller in size effects the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> octahedrons located either in a hexagonal R-block or at its boundary with S-block.

50|$|Until {{the advent}} of multicoatings and the {{popularity}} of the Plössl, orthoscopics were the most popular design for telescope eyepieces. Even today these eyepieces are considered good eyepieces for planetary and lunar viewing.

25|$|Sublimation is {{important}} in the preparation of certain classes of biological specimens for scanning electron microscopy. Typically the specimens are prepared by cryofixation and freeze-fracture, after which the broken surface is freeze-etched, being eroded by exposure to vacuum till it shows the required level of detail. This technique can display protein molecules, organelle structures and lipid bilayers with very low <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Cabinet {{projection}} is similar, {{but only}} one axis is skewed, the others being horizontal and vertical. Originally used in cabinet making, the advantage is that a principal side (e.g. a cabinet front) is displayed without distortion, so only the less important sides are skewed. The lines leading away from the eye are drawn at a reduced scale to lessen the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion.</b> The cabinet projection is seen in Victorian engraved advertisements and architectural textbooks, but has virtually disappeared from general use.|$|E
5000|$|The 4-element orthographic {{eyepiece}} {{consists of}} a plano-convex singlet eye lens and a cemented convex-convex triplet field lens achromatic field lens. This gives the eyepiece a nearly perfect image quality and good eye relief, but a narrow apparent field of view — about 40°-45°. It was invented by Ernst Abbe in 1880.

50|$|The {{glass in}} old windows {{can be as}} {{important}} as the sashes themselves, varying from very early 'plate' or 'broad' glass to 'crown' or 'cylinder'. Old glass is easily recognised by its imperfections ('ream') which give a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> both when looking through it and when looking at it from the outside. Of these, the only glass still currently being manufactured in the traditional way is cylinder. All other old glass is therefore irreplaceable and should be carefully conserved and/or protected before any work is carried out.|$|E
50|$|The {{essence of}} {{elasticity}} is reversibility. Forces applied to an elastic material transfer {{energy into the}} material which, upon yielding that energy to its surroundings, can recover its original shape. However, all materials have limits to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> they can endure without breaking or irreversibly altering their internal structure. Hence, the characterizations of solid materials include specification, usually in terms of strains, of its elastic limits. Beyond the elastic limit, a material is no longer storing all of the energy from mechanical work performed {{on it in the}} form of elastic energy.|$|E

His studies {{of the difference between}} the material artwork and human perception of it indicated that perception differs with the subject of an image. Great artists deliberately distorted perspective, and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> depends on the subject.|$|E

40|$|Explanation of the Allais paradox and the {{preference}} of many for multiple prize lottery tickets provide {{a rationale for}} why a model of agent's choice under uncertainty should embody the assumption that they distort probabilities. However the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> probability <b>distortion</b> required to explain gambling on long shots in Cumulative Prospect Theory appears problematic since it implies subjective expected rates of return are dramatically higher than objective returns. Here we show that a Markowitz model of expected utility, supplemented by a small <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> probability <b>distortion,</b> has qualitatively similar predictions as Cumulative Prospect Theory for numerous experimental outcomes {{as well as the}} indifference curves between expected return and objective probabilities for a given stake gamble. In addition we show how a small <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> probability <b>distortion</b> can lead to a preference for a multiple prize lottery which has a rather different prize structure and associated probabilities than the optimally chosen one prize lottery even though the utility gain is small.

50|$|Addition of a two carbon group between carbons 6 and 14 (e.g., 6,14-ethano, 6,14-etheno, and 6,14-ethyno), {{and which}} {{significantly}} distorts the C ring, may increase potency 1,000 to 10,000 times, or greater, compared to morphine, as in etorphine, and others. The relative potency {{is thought to}} be associated with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> of the C ring, and is perhaps greatest in diprenorphine, where this group is α,α-dimethyl-6,14-etheno. Diprenorphine (M5050) is the recommended etorphine (M99) antagonist, but it is not a pure opioid antagonist (i.e., it is also a weak opioid agonist), so naloxone remains a significant therapeutic tool in suspected cases of opioid overdose.

50|$|The {{ionosphere}} bends {{radio waves}} {{in the same manner}} that water in a swimming pool bends visible light. When the medium through which such waves travel is disturbed, the light image or radio information is distorted and can become unrecognizable. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> (scintillation) of a radio wave by the ionosphere depends on the signal frequency. Radio signals in the VHF band (30 to 300 MHz) can be distorted beyond recognition by a disturbed ionosphere. Radio signals in the UHF band (300 MHz to 3 GHz) transit a disturbed ionosphere, but a receiver {{may not be able to}} keep locked to the carrier frequency. GPS uses signals at 1575.42 MHz (L1) and 1227.6 MHz (L2) that can be distorted by a disturbed ionosphere. Space weather events that corrupt GPS signals can significantly impact society. For example, the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) operated by the US Federal Aviation Administration is used as a navigation tool for North American commercial aviation. It is disabled by every major space weather event. Outages can range from minutes to days. Major space weather events can push the disturbed polar ionosphere 10° to 30° of latitude toward the equator and can cause large ionospheric gradients (changes in density over distance of hundreds of km) at mid and low latitude. Both of these factors can distort GPS signals.|$|E

30|$|As Fig.  3 c, d shows, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> (for both {{distances}} and angles) distinctly {{depends on the}} type of doping and has no evident correlation with the adsorbent structure. Only the GR-und- 2 configuration does not conform to the tendency since it is characterized by far different adsorption geometry (see Fig.  2 and accompanying text). When the anions are adsorbed on the B-doped adsorbents, they undergo weaker distortions as compared to adsorption on undoped structures. In turn, the distortions become stronger when the anions are adsorbed on the N-doped carbon nanostructures. The picture <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> is well consistent with the indicated above decrease (increase) of the strength of chemical bonding due to B(N)-doping.|$|R
40|$|Corruption, {{particularly}} {{political or}} “grand” corruption, distorts the entire decision-making process connected with public investment projects. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> is higher with weaker auditing institutions. The evidence presented shows that higher corruption {{is associated with}} (i) higher public investment; (ii) lower government revenues; (iii) lower expenditures on operations and maintenance; and (iv) lower quality of public infrastructure. The evidence also shows that corruption increases public investment while reducing its productivity. These are five channels through which corruption lowers growth. An implication is that economists should be more restrained in their praise of high public sector investment, especially in countries with high corruption. ...|$|R

30|$|To sum up, {{the skip}} mode targets rate {{reduction}} without invoking a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> that undermines the RD performance.
