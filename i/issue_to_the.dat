5|$|A related <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> classic horizon problem arises {{because in}} most {{standard}} cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before electroweak symmetry breaking occurs, so inflation {{should not be}} able to prevent large-scale discontinuities in the electroweak vacuum since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the electroweak epoch ended.|$|E
5|$|From 2011 to 2015, {{the village}} was {{involved}} in an annexation proposal with the town of Ossining. A petition circulated in Ossining election districts 17 and 20 (comprising 1,600 people), which was signed by about 20 percent of the residents. The petition was filed in October 2013, and a public hearing was held with both government boards in December 2013. In March 2014, Briarcliff's board approved the proposal, and Ossining's board rejected it. In 2014, Briarcliff Manor {{was in the process}} of appealing the <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Appellate Division Court, though in May 2015 the Briarcliff board voted to discontinue its appeal.|$|E

5|$|General Bell {{had been}} the manager {{of one of the}} coal mines in Cripple Creek where the strike was taking place. It wasn't any {{surprise}} to Haywood that soldiers seemed to be working {{in the interests of the}} employers; he had seen that situation before. But when the Colorado legislature acknowledged the complaints of organized labor and passed an eight hour law, the Colorado supreme court declared it unconstitutional. So the WFM took the <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> voters, and 72 percent of the state's voters approved the referendum. But the Colorado government ignored the results of the referendum.|$|E

5|$|Larkin {{had asked}} {{on his deathbed}} that his diaries be destroyed.

When she died on 15 February 2001, Jones, in turn, left one million pounds to St Paul's Cathedral, Hexham Abbey, and Durham Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|The {{presiding}} consul began each {{meeting with}} a speech on an issue, and then referred the <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> senators, who discussed the matter by order of seniority. Unimportant matters could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands, while important votes resulted in a physical division of the house, with senators voting by taking a place {{on either side of}} the chamber. Any vote was always between a proposal and its negative.|$|E
5|$|The tribe {{sued the}} United States for {{compensation}} in the US Court of Claims, which ruled that tribal members still had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and that Congress had not abrogated the rights. The opposite rulings {{by the state and}} federal courts brought the <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court. In 1968, the Supreme Court held that the tribe retained its hunting and fishing rights under the treaties involved and the rights were not lost after federal recognition was ended by the Menominee Indian Termination Act without a clear and unequivocal statement by Congress removing the rights.|$|E

The first issue had a publication date of 1 January 1951, and the first eight issues had publication dates of the 1st and 15th of each month. From the ninth <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end Authentic maintained a completely regular monthly schedule; the publication date was given in the magazine as the 15th of each month from issue 9 through issue 73; thereafter the date was just given as the month and year.|$|E

5|$|England made 141 and Bradman {{forced them}} to follow on. Miller removed Hutton again, this time caught by Sid Barnes from the first ball of the innings. He {{combined}} with Barnes 45 minutes later to remove Hutton's opening partner Washbrook to leave England at 3/33. The pitch, still rain-affected, hastened England's defeat by an innings and 332 runs within 44 overs. Miller finished with 2/17 from 11 overs in the second innings to end with match figures of 9/77. England had fallen to their heaviest Test defeat on Australian soil, losing 15 wickets {{in the space of}} 210 minutes on the fifth day. Miller's highly productive Ashes debut led to further speculation as to whether he was willing to end his Test career to turn professional in England. Miller continued to ignore Rawtenstall's requests for confirmation and refused to comment on the <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media, hoping that he would get a better job offer in Australia in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|For the Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen) each {{decontamination}} battery (Entgiftungs-Batterie) {{was authorized}} six Sd.Kfz. 10/1 and six Sd.Kfz. 10/2. Eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/3 {{were held at}} the battalion level for <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> batteries in lieu of their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s if needed. If necessary they could be substituted for Sd.Kfz. 11s of the appropriate type. When the decontamination units were authorized to be re-equipped with heavy rocket launchers in November 1941 seven Sd.Kfz. 10/1s were used to tow the 28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 launchers and another {{was used by the}} platoon leader to tow an anti-tank gun. Similarly decontamination units usually retained their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s and used them just like the 10/1s after removing their special equipment. However, it seems that the 10/3s were turned in when the unit was reorganized.|$|E
5|$|In February 1836 Edwards landed 170 {{black people}} in Texas, taking {{advantage}} of the confusion surrounding the end of the Texas Revolution and the establishment of the independent Republic of Texas, which had not yet outlawed the importation of slaves. William Fisher, the customs collector on the Brazos River, wrote to the Texas Constitutional Convention that Edwards did not report the importation to the authorities, and Fisher went to Edwards' plantation to confront Edwards. Because of uncertainty about the legality of importing slaves, Fisher did not seize the slaves but referred the <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> newly formed Texas Government after securing a monetary bond from Edwards. Although the new Texas Republic eventually outlawed the importation of slaves from anywhere but the United States, Edwards' landing of slaves from Cuba in early 1836 was never prosecuted. After this, Edwards also established a slave market on Galveston Bay, near present-day San Leon. In 1837, he was sued by Robert Peebles for fraud involving the sale of a slave with tuberculosis to Peebles. Peebles won the case.|$|E
