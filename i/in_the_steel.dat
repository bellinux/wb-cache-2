5|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{industrial use}} of vanadium was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>steel</b> alloy chassis of the Ford Model T, inspired by French race cars. Vanadium steel allowed for reduced weight while simultaneously increasing tensile strength (ca. 1905).|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} oxidizers like sodium nitrate {{are added to}} enhance the reaction. The result is {{aluminium}} oxide and ferroniobium, an alloy of iron and niobium used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>steel</b> production. Ferroniobium contains between 60 and 70% niobium. Without iron oxide, the aluminothermic process is used to produce niobium. Further purification is necessary to reach the grade for superconductive alloys. Electron beam melting under vacuum is the method used by the two major distributors of niobium.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{participated in}} a five-man {{gauntlet}} match for the number one contender's spot for the WWE Championship on April 11 episode of Raw, but was eliminated by R-Truth. The next week on Raw, Morrison challenged R-Truth to a match {{later on in the}} night, with the stipulation that if Morrison won, he would take R-Truth's place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>steel</b> cage match at Extreme Rules. Truth accepted, and lost the match, making Morrison the new number one contender. At Extreme Rules, R-Truth interfered in the match, attacking Morrison and preventing him from winning the match. The next night on Raw, Morrison was attacked by Truth again, prior to a scheduled match between the two which did not happen as a result. Morrison then underwent surgery to correct a legitimately pinched nerve in his neck.|$|E

40|$|Investigations of {{precipitation}} and its development during ageing at 475 °C in four maraging steels with different Mo- and Si-contents {{have been conducted}} using high resolution techniques such as 3 -dimensional atom probe and energy filtered electron microscopy. <b>The</b> precipitation sequence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>steels</b> proved to be quite complex and involved formation of different phases one on the other. Presence of Mo <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>steels</b> contributed to a higher complexity {{of precipitation}} process and kept the interparticle distance being small up to 100 h of ageing.

40|$|SEM in-situ {{investigations}} of the micromechanisms of damage initiation and fracture in tool <b>steels</b> are described. <b>The</b> critical state of the material and the damage growth were observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tests.

A hierarchical finite element model of damage initiation, which included a macroscopic model of the deformation of the specimen under real experimental conditions and a mesomechanical model of damage in real microstructures of steels was developed.

5|$|The {{approach}} quickly {{caught on}} in Chicago. In 1889 the Tacoma Building replaced the bolted metal design with a stronger riveted approach, and Chicago's Chamber of Commerce Building introduced interior light courts to the structural design of skyscrapers. The 1890 Rand McNally Building became {{in the first}} entirely self-supporting, steel-framed skyscraper. Some buildings, such as The Rookery and the Monadnock Building, combined elements of both the newer and older styles, but generally Chicago rapidly adopted steel structures as a flexible and effective way to produce a range of tall buildings. Structural engineers specializing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>steel</b> frame design began to establish practices in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} another {{standard}} match involving Shelton Benjamin and Kerwin White. White {{tried to get}} in the ring, but Benjamin slid out and tripped him. Benjamin threw White into the ring barricade, which led him to throw him back in the ring as the bell rang to officially start the match. In the ring, Benjamin body slammed White, which was followed by a running forearm. White retaliated with a dropkick to Benjamin's knee. The match concluded after White grabbed a golf club that he hid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>steel</b> steps and tried to assault Benjamin with it. Benjamin, however, countered with a T-Bone Suplex and covered White and got the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>steel</b> erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E
40|$|Strength and {{work-hardening}} in steels {{have been}} discussed {{from the viewpoint of}} heterogeneous deformation.

5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>steel</b> of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building turns off its lights during bird migration seasons.|$|E

40|$|We studied three {{series of}} Z-phase {{strengthened}} steels using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography {{to reveal the}} detailed microstructure of these <b>steels.</b> <b>In</b> particular, <b>the</b> phase transformation from M(C,N) to Z-phase (CrMN) was studied. Carbon content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>steels</b> is <b>the</b> governing factor <b>in</b> this transformation. <b>The</b> impact toughness of some test alloys was rather low. This is attributed {{to the formation of}} a continuous W-rich film along prior austenite grain boundaries.

25|$|The {{collapse}} of the AA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>steel</b> industry was due {{not only to the}} shock of the loss at Homestead, but by changing conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>steel</b> industry. So long as steel, like iron smelting, remained a craft-like endeavor, the AA—with the allegiance of each plant's skilled workers—could control the industry. But as the steel industry mechanized, the skills needed to manufacture steel shrank. Inexperienced workers could learn the unskilled work quickly. Steel manufacturers also realized that having multi-plant operations meant that production could continue if the union struck a particular facility.|$|E
