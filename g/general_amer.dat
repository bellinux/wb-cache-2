50|$|In 1986 a West German company built {{a factory}} in Taji to {{manufacture}} steel for several military uses. It was enlisted to retrofit and rebuild tanks already on duty in the Iraqi Army, such as T-54/55s, T-62s, and several hundred of Soviet and Polish T-72s, imported during {{early stages of the}} war with Iran.In the late-1980s plans were made to produce new T-72M1 tanks in Taji. These tanks were to be assembled from knockdown kits delivered by the Polish state-owned company Bumar-Łabędy. The assembly was to start in 1989 and the tanks would receive the name Asad Babil (Lion of Babylon). According to Polish officials not a single T-72M1 was finished, even though in 1988 a T-72M was displayed on an Iraqi arms show, which was claimed to be locally produced. The local assembly of the T-72 started in Taji in early 1989 as suggested by Iraqi officials. A number of Iraqi officials such as Lt. <b>General</b> <b>Amer</b> Rashid however did not like the idea of being dependent on knockdown kits supplied by another country and pushed for the complete production of the T-72M1 tank instead.In 1991 the Taji plant was destroyed by an airstrike while being upgraded by Bumar-Łabędy.|$|E

However, Bizri fell out with Nasser soon after the union because Nasser appointed his friend Egyptian <b>General</b> Abdel Hakim <b>Amer</b> as governor of Syria. Nasser distrusted Bizri's communist leanings, and eventually dismissed him from office in June 1959, and outlawed the communist party soon after.|$|R

During the 1952 revolution led by the Free Officers, Boghdadi commanded jet fighter units to circle around Cairo to prevent possible outside interference in the coup against King Farouk. After the Free Officers assumed power, Gamal Abdel Nasser—the principal leader of the coup and the new Prime Minister of Egypt—made Boghdadi chairman of a special court established to try members of the monarchy, sentencing former <b>general</b> Hussein Sirri <b>Amer</b> and a Wafd party leader Fouad Sarrag Eddine, among others, to long-term prison sentences. Most sentences were commuted, however.|$|R
500|$|On 11 October 1951, the Wafd {{government}} abrogated the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, {{which had}} given the British control over the Suez Canal until 1956. The popularity of this move, {{as well as that}} of government-sponsored guerrilla attacks against the British, put pressure on Nasser to act. According to Sadat, Nasser decided to wage [...] "a large scale assassination campaign". In January 1952, he and Hassan Ibrahim attempted to kill the royalist <b>general</b> Hussein Sirri <b>Amer</b> by firing their submachine guns at his car as he drove through the streets of Cairo. Instead of killing the general, the attackers wounded an innocent female passerby. Nasser recalled that her wails [...] "haunted" [...] him and firmly dissuaded him from undertaking similar actions in the future.|$|R

50|$|In a leaked {{document}} from summer 2014, {{the ties}} between Iran and Sudan {{are described as}} being “strategic”, “military” and “defensive”. <b>General</b> Siddiq <b>Amer,</b> Director <b>General</b> of Intelligence and Security, - “Iran is our biggest ally in the region, in terms of cooperation {{in the areas of}} intelligence and military industrial production.” General Abd al-Rahim Mohammed Husein, Minister of Defence, said: “ All the advancement in our military industry is from Iran. They opened the doors of their stores of weapons for us, at a time the Arabs stood against us. The Iranian support came when we were fighting a rebellion that spread in all directions including the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The Iranians provided us with experts and they trained our M.I. Intelligence and security cadres. They also trained us in weapons production and transferred to us modern technology in the military production industry. There is one full battalion of the Republican Guards still with us here and other experts who are constructing interception and spying bases in order to protect us, plus an advanced Air Defense system. They built for us Kenana and Jebel Awliya Air Force bases.” The Kenana Air Force base is likely situated south of the city of Rabak (White Nile State), near the Kenana Sugar Company facilities. The minutes reveal that Sudan has also provided weapons to the Houthis (a Shia insurgent group) operating in Yemen.|$|R
5000|$|Caught up in Arab {{enthusiasm for}} {{military}} action and encouraged {{by the lack of}} response to the closure of the Straits, Egyptian Field Marshal Amer planned for initiating an attack on Israel in late May. He told one of his generals that [...] "This time we will be the ones to start the war." [...] This was counter to Nasser's strategy of pushing Israel to start the war. Historian Michael Oren states that Egyptian sources are divided over why Nasser did not veto Amer's plan. Oren suggests that [...] "Nasser was apprised of plan but lacked the political strength to override Amer's order. Also, the preparation of an Egyptian invasion of Israel had certain advantages for Nasser..." [...] The Egyptian attack plan was code-named Operation Dawn, and was planned by <b>General</b> Abdel Hakim <b>Amer.</b> It called for the strategic bombing of Israeli airfields, ports, cities, and the Negev Nuclear Research Center. Arab armies would then invade Israel, and cut it in half with an armored thrust through the Negev.|$|R

5000|$|In 1990, came Galal Ibrhim {{became the}} {{president}} of the club due to the death of Eng. Hasan Abo el Fetouh. This temporary board was held till September 1990 when the general club meeting was held with the elections of which Eng. [...] "Mohamad Nour El Daly" [...] became {{the president of}} the new board till 1992. In 1992, Galal Ibrhim came as the new president of the club. As the rules were changed right then and the vice treasurer was to be selected mostly by the board members, and then Hamada emam was selected by default to that position while Abdel Hamid Shaheen was elected to the treasurer position. As for the board members, it consisted of: Dr. Ahmed Shereen Fawzy, Mahmoud Marouf, Mohamad Fayez El Zummur, Raouf Gaser, and Tarek Ghonaim. As per the rules, it was also new to have two members of the board under the age of 30. For these two spots, Samy Abo El Kheir and Ihab Ibrahim were elected. As for the appointed members by the high committee for youth and sports, Dr. Mohamad <b>Amer,</b> <b>General</b> Hanafy Reyad, and Farouk Abo El Nasr were added to the board. By 1994, Abdel Hamid Shaheen was not able to continue his duties due to his sickness, but the board chose to keep him in the position in honor of his devotion to the club, and thus Farouk Abo El Nasr was appointed to take the duties while keeping Abdel Hamid Shaheen in the position. In 1995, changes came to the board due to the court removal of four members in the board due to their absence from the board meetings for 6 times. These members were Mahmoud Marouf, Mohamad Fayez El Zummur, Dr. Mohamad Amer. The newly appointed members were Mortada Mansour, Mahmoud Abdallah, Mounnir Hassan, and Ibrahim Latif. Still the high committee for youth and sports objected on linking the appointed members with the elected ones and as a result Mounnir Hassan, and Ibrahim Latif forfeited their positions for the better good of the club and to remove any embarrassment happening to the board. And as a surprise, the newly two appointed members for the club board were Dr. Mohamad Amer and Farouk Abo El Nasr in support of their abilities and their dedication. As a result, Dr. Shereen Fawzy was selected to be treasurer till the new elections. On Thursday 4 July, came the decision by Dr. Abd El Menem Emarah to release the club board and the Egyptian Football Federation board after the sad incidence in the game between Ahly and Zamalek season 95/96, as the board decided to freeze the football activity in the club. Meanwhile, the EFF made a series of wrong decisions which caused it to be released too. As a result, a one-year temporary club board was selected of which Dr. Kamal Darweesh was the president and General Abd EL Aziz Kabil was vice president with the board members consisting of General Hanafy Reyad, Magdy Sharaf, Ismail Selim", Azmy megahed, and [...] "Mohamad Abd El Rahman Fawzy. Also, accountant Mahmoud Badr El Deen was appointed as treasurer.|$|R
