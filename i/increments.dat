5|$|Jump {{distance}} is measured {{from the edge}} of the table to the placement of landing by <b>increments</b> of 0.5m. This is done using electronic and video monitoring systems together with event personnel assigned to observe jumps by the side of the hill, known as 'distance measurers'. If enough jumps are deemed to be too far beyond the hill size, or near the 'fall line' as determined by the jury – the zone where the slope begins to flatten out – an immediate meeting is held between the jury and race director, which usually results in the start gate being lowered so as to check inrun speeds and therefore distances. For spectators and judges, <b>increments</b> of 5m are clearly indicated by rows of fir across the hill; a painted red line is used for the K-point, and a dashed red line for the hill size. Both sides of the hill are also marked highly visible in red to indicate the 'landing zone', while the point beyond the hill size is marked in green on the sides.|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of a brief <b>increment</b> in {{the intensity of}} a longer duration pedestal is commonly used {{as a measure of}} intensity-resolution. <b>Increment</b> detection is known to improve with increasing duration of the <b>increment</b> and also with increasing duration of the pedestal, but the relative effects of these two parameters have not been explored in the same study. In several past studies of the effects of <b>increment</b> duration, pedestal duration was increased as <b>increment</b> duration increased. In the present study, <b>increment</b> and pedestal duration were independently manipulated. Increment-detection thresholds were determined for four subjects with normal-hearing using a 500 - or 4000 -Hz pedestal presented at 60 dB sound pressure level (SPL). <b>Increment</b> durations were 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 ms. Pedestal durations were 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 ms. Each <b>increment</b> duration was combined with all pedestals of equal or greater duration. Multiple-regression analyses indicate that <b>increment</b> detection under these conditions is determined primarily by pedestal duration. Follow-up experiments ruled out effects of off-frequency listening or overshoot. The results suggest that effects of <b>increment</b> duration have been confounded by effects of pedestal duration in studies that co-varied <b>increment</b> and pedestal duration. Implications for models of temporal integration are discussed...|$|R

At the time, it was established UN practice to seek consent of the country where its peacekeepers were deployed, and the letter effectively required UNPROFOR to withdraw completely from Croatia. Such action would also require abolishment of the UNPAs, which had been identified as integral parts of Croatia by United Nations Security Council Resolution 815 of 30 March 1993.

5|$|The US Navy Heliox {{saturation}} decompression rates {{require a}} partial pressure of oxygen {{to be maintained}} at between 0.44 and 0.48 atm when possible, but not to exceed 23% by volume, to restrict the risk of fire.

Decompression is done for 16 hours in 24, with the remaining 8 hours split into two rest periods. A further adaptation generally made to the schedule is to stop at 4fsw for the time that is would theoretically take to complete the decompression at the specified rate, i.e. 80 minutes, and then complete the decompression to surface at 1fsw per minute. This is done to avoid the possibility of losing the door seal at a low pressure differential and losing the last hour or so of slow decompression.|$|E
