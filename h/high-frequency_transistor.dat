40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a directly modulated, 60 GHz zero-IF transceiver architecture suitable for single-carrier, low-power, multi-gigabit wireless links in nanoscale CMOS technologies. This mm-wave front end architecture requires no upconversion of the baseband signals in the transmitter and no analog-to-digital conversion in the receiver, thus minimizing system complexity and power consumption. All circuit blocks are realized using sub- 1. 0 V topologies, that feature {{only a single}} <b>high-frequency</b> <b>transistor</b> between the supply and ground, and which are scalable to future 45 nm, 32 nm, and 22 nm CMOS nodes. The transceiver is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process with a digital back-end. It includes a receiver with 14. 7 dB gain and 5. 6 dB noise figure, a 60 GHz LO distribution tree, a 69 GHz static frequency divider, and a direct BPSK modulator operating over the 55 – 65 GHz band at data rates exceeding 6 Gb/s. With both the transmitter and the receiver turned on, the chip consumes 374 mW from 1. 2 V which reduces to 232 mW for a 1. 0 V supply. It occupies 1. 28 0. 81 mm. The transceiver and its building blocks were characterized over temperature up to 85 C and for power supplies down to 1 V. A manufacturability study of 60 GHz radio circuits is presented with measurements of transistors, the low-noise amplifier, and the receiver on slow, typical, and fast process splits.

40|$|Graphene {{demonstrated}} {{potential for}} practical applications owing to its excellent electronic and thermal properties. Typical graphene field-effect transistors and interconnects built on conventional SiO 2 /Si substrates reveal the breakdown current density {{on the order}} of 1 uA/nm 2 (i. e. 10 ^ 8 A/cm 2) which is 100 × larger than the fundamental limit for the metals but still smaller than the maximum achieved in carbon nanotubes. We show that by replacing SiO 2 with synthetic diamond one can substantially increase the current-carrying capacity of graphene to as high as 18 uA/nm 2 even at ambient conditions. Our results indicate that graphene's current-induced breakdown is thermally activated. We also found that the current carrying capacity of graphene can be improved not only on the single-crystal diamond substrates but also on an inexpensive ultrananocrystalline diamond, which can be produced in a process compatible with a conventional Si technology. The latter was attributed to the decreased thermal resistance of the ultrananocrystalline diamond layer at elevated temperatures.
