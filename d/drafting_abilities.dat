50|$|Day {{was born}} in Hamilton, New Zealand. At the age of eleven, Day began Saturday morning classes at Elam School of Art, University of Auckland, under the tuteleage of Archie Fisher, John Weeks, Lois White and Ida Eise. In 1939, {{he went on to}} study as a {{full-time}} student at Elam, graduating with a preliminary diploma in fine arts two years later. Apart from a brief period at Auckland Teachers’ Training College, Day spent the remaining war years in the New Zealand Army and then the Royal New Zealand Air Force. Due to his <b>drafting</b> <b>abilities</b> he worked on topographical and landscape views of the Matakana area and Mototapu Islands.|$|E
50|$|The Vyatka breed was {{influenced}} by the climate and terrain of the Kirov, Udmurtia and western Perm regions; Estonian horses and Kleppers brought to northern Russia by Novgorod colonists in the 14th century may have affected its conformation, as may later imports of Estonian horses for mining work in the Ural Mountains. The Vyatka horse became known for <b>draft</b> <b>abilities</b> including endurance, speed and frugality. By the middle of the 19th century it was considered the best horse for pulling troikas; some were exported from the Vyatka region, including to Poland.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} {{performance}} of the swamp buffalo concerning reproductive traits, growth and carcass, milk production, and work capacities was presented. The potential for breeding improvement of certain traits was discussed. Breeding objectives and goals to suit the need of Asian smallfarmers were emphasized. Breeding of swamp buffalo for draft and for multi-purpose was discussed. Genetic selection and crossbreeding of the swamp buffalo were reviewed. It was proposed that genetic selection for weight and gain should improve meat production as well as <b>draft</b> <b>ability</b> of the swamp buffalo, while crossbreeding {{should be limited to}} experimental scale until crossbred buffaloes have been well tested for farmers 2 ̆ 7 acceptance under prevailing smallfarm conditions. The aspect of germplasm conservation was also emphasized...|$|R

50|$|Conventional mines {{of the era}} {{employed}} a contact-fuzed explosive charge within a buoyant shell suspended over an anchor attached by a wire rope. Use of such mines against surface ships required the mine to be suspended at a depth no greater than the ship's <b>draft.</b> <b>Ability</b> of a submarine to submerge under that depth would require several layers of contact-fuzed mines at differing depths to afford equal probability of destruction. The World War I mine barrage had {{reduced the number of}} mines required by using a copper wire antenna with a float to extend it above the mine. A ship's steel hull touching the copper antenna would form a battery, and seawater acted as an electrolyte completing a circuit with an insulated copper plate on the mine surface to actuate a detonating relay within the mine.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Domestic cow, Bos taurus {{is one of}} the {{important}} species selected by humans for various traits, viz. milk yield, meat quality, <b>draft</b> <b>ability,</b> resistance to disease and pests and social and religious reasons. Since cattle domestication from Neolithic (8, 000 - 10, 000 years ago) today the population has reached 1. 5 billion and further it’s likely to be 2. 6 billion by 2050. High magnitude of numbers, breed management, market need of traceability of breed product, conservation prioritization and IPR issues due to germplasm flow/exchange, has created a critical need for accurate and rapid breed identification. Since ages the defined breed descriptors has been used in identification of breed but due to lack of phenotypic description especially in ova, semen, embryos and breed products molecular approach is indispensable. Further the degree of admixture and non-descript animals characterization, needs of molecular approach is imperative. Till date breed identification methods based on molecular data analysis has great limitations like lack of reference dat...|$|R
50|$|It was in {{this period}} also that the ADG {{finalised}} rate cards for directors' fees. And while directors’ contracts had also been <b>drafted,</b> the <b>ability</b> to negotiate with producers for their implementation still remained a stumbling block. In 2014, following discussions with MEAA and SPAA, the ADG received unanimous support from its members for the constitutional changes necessary for registration as an industrial union.|$|R
50|$|Tabbed No. 18 {{overall in}} the 2006 PBA <b>Draft,</b> Luanzon's <b>ability</b> to defend the quicker players and hit the {{perimeter}} opens an opportunity for him to reach the big league. He played for Habrour Center in the PBL where he only suited up for four games. And the youngster knows that his role will be limited with the Aces but will be ready when given the opportunity.|$|R
25|$|During the Vietnam War, the {{military}} <b>draft</b> (and the <b>ability</b> {{to avoid the}} draft by enrolling in college) contributed to increases in college attendance throughout the US. Attendance at the college increased but then fell when the draft ended in the 1970s causing financial strain not unlike the losing of students to the Civil War had done in the then distant past.|$|R
5000|$|The Minnesota Vikings {{first round}} draft choice in 1973, Chuck Foreman was {{selected}} with the 12th overall {{pick in the}} <b>draft.</b> His pass-catching <b>ability</b> out of the backfield, combined {{with the ability to}} make the first tackler miss, was a key in the Minnesota Viking offense, which was sort of a precursor of the West Coast Offense which became popular in the following decades. Chuck is widely known as [...] "The Spin Doctor" [...] for his elusive way of avoiding would-be tacklers.|$|R
5000|$|Lame ducks {{are often}} found in sport. The teams that are {{eliminated}} from playoff contention are lame ducks, and have nothing remaining to play for, often with several weeks of games remaining on the schedule. In some cases, losing the remaining games can be more favorable than attempting to win them, due to more favorable positioning in a <b>draft</b> and the <b>ability</b> to land more talented players. Teams in Europe (especially those without drafts) discourage [...] "losing out" [...] by imposing a relegation system that expels the lowest teams from the league. A draft lottery is used in some North American professional leagues to discourage losing out by randomizing who gets the top draft picks, while still assuring the less talented teams {{have access to the}} players necessary to compete.|$|R
40|$|Rehabilitation {{hospitals}} {{provide a}} striking contrast between young, fit and largely able-bodied staff and {{patients who have}} experienced significant, often sudden, life-changing events. Bridging the gap between these worlds is not easy, {{but it can also}} be difficult to reconcile the values that the patients held before injury or illness with those that have begun to emerge on the road to recovery. Those working in rehabilitation medicine often endorse a process model of consent because they understand that patients with fresh injuries may need time for their values to adapt to their new lives. Despite this understanding, it can be a challenge to understand how best to respect patient autonomy whilst helping those same patients to appreciate some of the limits on their <b>abilities.</b> <b>Drafting</b> the following personal narrative, drawn from my own experience as a healthcare ethicist and reluctant patient, gave me greater insight into these perplexities. This reflection explores my changing approach to my professional practice – and especially my view of patient autonomy – in light of my own experience with post-partum depression...|$|R
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an {{office at the}} University of Melbourne in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books {{on a variety of}} topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled Changing Patterns: An Atypical Autobiography, which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final <b>draft,</b> and his <b>ability</b> to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published Cellular Immunology, considered his magnum opus on immunity, attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote Immunological Surveillance, which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of glycogen synthase 1 (GYS 1) mutation on performance traits in Noriker draft horse stallions. Individual scores of 32 performance traits and the final performance score were obtained from 169 stallions that took part in the standardized stationary 30 -day performance test throughout the years 2002 to 2014. In 2014 the stallions have been genotyped for the GYS 1 mutation resulting in 105 non-mutation-carriers, 57 heterozygous, and 7 homozygous animals. The mean frequency of animals carrying the mutation was 38  % (64 of 169). The final performance score and 32 single performance traits were analyzed using a linear model including the GYS 1 mutation genotype, the testing year and age as fixed effects. For the final performance score no effect of the GYS 1 mutation was found. In three single traits – driving <b>ability,</b> <b>drafting</b> manner, and kindness in the discipline heavy-load lodging – significantly lower scores for heterozygous horses than for non-carrier animals were obtained. Homozygous animals did not differ significantly from both groups. Our results from this retrospective study suggest no effect of the GYS 1 mutation on performance traits and on the final performance score...|$|R
5000|$|The Far West was light, {{strong and}} speedy. She was {{initially}} {{owned by the}} Coulson Packet Line who contracted with the Army in the 1870s to provide steamboats to support Army expeditions on the Yellowstone River in the Montana Territory. The Far West {{was used in this}} capacity, along with its sister riverboat the Josephine. The Far West was often piloted by the famous river boat captain and pilot, Grant Marsh. The Far West was known as a fast boat because she had powerful engines, a hull with limited water resistance, and a low profile that reduced wind resistance. She set a number of speed records for both upstream and downstream travel on the Missouri and the Yellowstone. By virtue of her shallow <b>draft</b> and her <b>ability</b> to [...] "grasshopper" [...] over sand bars (using spars and steam capstans {{on the front of the}} boat to lift the boat and swing it forward a few feet at a time) she was famous for being able to get through shallow channels and low water conditions on the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers that turned back other steamboats.|$|R
40|$|Public health {{labs and}} food {{regulatory}} agencies globally are embracing whole genome sequencing (WGS) as a revolutionary new method that is positioned to replace numerous existing diagnostic and microbial typing technologies {{with a single}} new target: the microbial <b>draft</b> genome. The <b>ability</b> to cheaply generate large amounts of microbial genome sequence data, combined with emerging policies of food regulatory and public health institutions making their microbial sequences increasingly available and public, has served {{to open up the}} field to the general scientific community. This open data access policy shift has resulted in a proliferation of data being deposited into sequence repositories and of novel bioinformatics software designed to analyze these vast datasets. There also has been a more recent drive for improved data sharing to achieve more effective global surveillance, public health and food safety. Such developments have heightened the need for enhanced analytical systems in order to process and interpret this new type of data in a timely fashion. In this review we outline the emergence of genomics, bioinformatics and open data in the context of food safety. We also survey major efforts to translate genomics and bioinformatics technologies out of the research lab and into routine use in modern food safety labs. We conclude by discussing the challenges and opportunities that remain, including those expected {{to play a major role}} in the future of food safety science...|$|R
40|$|A {{performance}} evaluation of several computers was necessary, so an evaluation program, or benchmark, was run on each computer to determine maximum possible performance. The program {{was used to}} test the Computer Aided <b>Drafting</b> (CAD) <b>ability</b> of each computer by monitoring the speed with which several functions were executed. The main objective of the benchmarking program was to record assembly loading times and image regeneration times and then compile a composite score that could be compared with the same tests on other computers. The three computers that were tested were the Compaq AP 550, the SGI 230, and the Hewlett-PackardP 750 C. The Compaq and SGI computers each had a Pentium III 733 mhz processor, while the Hewlett-Packard had a Pentium III 750 mhz processor. The size and speed of Random Access Memory (RAM) in each computer varied, as did the type of graphics card. Each computer that was tested was using Windows NT 4. 0 and Pro/ENGINEER{trademark} 2000 i CAD benchmark software provided by Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC). The benchmarking program came with its own assembly, automatically loaded and ran tests on the assembly, then compiled the time each test took to complete. Due to the automation of the tests, any sort of user error affecting test scores was virtually eliminated. After all the tests were completed, scores were then compiled and compared. The Silicon Graphics 230 was by far the overall winner with a composite score of 8. 57. The Compaq AP 550 was next with a score of 5. 19, while the Hewlett-Packard P 750 C performed dismally, achieving a score of 3. 34. Several factors, including motherboard chipset, graphics card, and the size and speed of RAM, were involved in the differing scores of the three machines. Surprisingly the Hewlett-Packard, which had the fastest processor, came back with the lowest score. The above factors most likely contributed to the poor performance of the Hewlett-Packard. Based on the results of the benchmark test, the SGI 230 appears to be the best CAD software solution. The Hewlett-Packard most likely performed poorly {{due to the fact that}} it was only running a 100 mhz Front Side Bus (FSB), while the SGI machine was running at a 133 mhz. The Compaq was using a new type of RAM called RDRAM. While this RAM was at first perceived to be a great performer, various benchmarks, including this one, have found that the computers using RDRAM really only achieve average performance...|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some that {{this is perhaps the}} most interesting of all the series events, including the race itself. In this event there are heats of 5–8 riders, depending on the number of riders signed up for the day. These heats are seeded according to the results of each rider's ITT. Riders are placed along the starting line in order from fastest (on the inside) to slowest (on the outside) and are then given one lap to get the position they want in the pack and to gain some speed. Once they cross the start/finish line again, the race begins. The riders race around the track and every time the pack crosses the start/finish line, the last one to cross is out and must leave the track. Riders keep racing until there are only three riders left. These three riders {{move on to the next}} round. This process continues until the final heat of 8. In this heat, riders continue to race and get out until you have the last three and then they commence a one lap full out sprint and the first, second, and third-place winners are determined by the order in which the riders cross the start/finish line. This is a great event because it really measures the skill of a rider, because in order to win, a rider must be more than just fast. If a rider hopes to win, she must also have good <b>drafting</b> skills, the <b>ability</b> to find good positioning, the intuition to know when to get out of the pack and sprint around the outside, and the endurance to be able to do this all day.|$|R
