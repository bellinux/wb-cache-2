50|$|Parsons {{turned to}} <b>Gothic</b> <b>writing</b> as a genre that was highly popular at the time. Critics often claimed her works were ill-written and disorganised. Parsons was a deeply {{religious}} Protestant, {{who believed in}} the good being rewarded and the wicked punished, which shows through in her works. Her first novel, The History of Miss Meredith, appeared in 1790, the year of her husband's death. The better-known The Castle of Wolfenbach followed in 1793, in a period when opinion in England and France was starting {{to turn away from}} arranged marriages. The Castle of Wolfenbach portrays this idea, along with belief in a strong patriarchal family and respect for the middle class rather than aristocracy. Other novels of hers include Women as They Are (1797) and The Valley of Saint Gotthard (1799). Parsons shows female Gothic-writing characteristics by having a heroine trick her way into an inheritance while pretending to be vulnerable and innocent.|$|E
5000|$|Skal's first nonfiction {{work was}} 1990's Hollywood Gothic: The Tangled Web of Dracula from Novel to Stage to Screen. This book {{discusses}} the various adaptations of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula, {{and the role}} of the vampire archetype in popular culture. A large portion of the book describes the efforts of Stoker's widow Florence to protect the rights to her husband's work. The book also contains the first in-depth study of a Spanish-language Dracula film produced in 1931. Kathleen Quinn of the New York Times praised Hollywood <b>Gothic,</b> <b>writing,</b> [...] "Skal tracks Transylvania's most popular vampire with dry wit and the skills of a fine detective." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "witty and comprehensive", and quipped that it was [...] "something to gnaw on long after those trick-or-treaters are gone". Writing in 2004, David Colton of USA Today noted that the book had [...] "become one of the field's essential reads" [...] and had [...] "raised the standards for horror researchers".|$|E

Single vowels are sometimes long where a historically present nasal consonant has been dropped {{in front of an}} [...] (a case of compensatory lengthening). Thus, the preterite of the verb briggan [...] "to bring" [...] (English bring, Dutch brengen, German bringen) becomes brahta [...] (English brought, Dutch bracht, German brachte), from the proto-Germanic *braŋk-dē. In detailed transliteration, when the intent is more phonetic transcription, length is noted by a macron (or failing that, often a circumflex): brāhta, brâhta. This is the only context in which [...] appears natively whereas , like , is found often enough in other contexts: brūks [...] "useful" [...] (Dutch gebruik, German Gebrauch, Icelandic brúk [...] "use").|$|E

5000|$|Another {{theme of}} The Castle of Wolfenbach, and often of gothic novels as a genre, {{is that of}} secret parentage, unknown identity, and questing to find oneself. As Diane Long Hoeveler points out in her Introduction to the Valancourt Edition of the novel, “Matilda’s {{challenge}} in the novel is to discover the secret of her birth, find her parents, and inherit her rightful property.” Robert Miles, in his genealogy of <b>Gothic</b> <b>Writing,</b> claims that in these novels, [...] "the usurped and disposed find their rights restored; the lost are found, and a true genealogy reasserts itself.” In fact, these things do happen for Matilda; she discovers her parentage, finds her mother, and inherits her noble class title. The gothic and romantic genres are obsessed with perfect, unsullied aristocratic lineages, and it is Matilda's unwritten and unknown history that keeps her so long apart from her true love, the Count de Bouville; she cannot admit that she loves the Count until she discovers her ancestry. As she discovers, [...] "she was of noble birth; no unlawful offspring, no child of poverty: then {{she thought of the}} Count”.|$|E
50|$|Rivarol {{began his}} {{statement}} by the language of Goethe. He blamed German people for having denied their own language during the 16th century. The French essayist declared that the inferiority position of German with regard to Latin explained {{in the fact that}} the Prussian empire had never been unified under the same crown. Another argument criticised the difficulty of German syntax that appeared to be an obstacle to the learning of this language. In addition, the glottal pronunciation, as well as the <b>gothic</b> <b>writing</b> “shocked people of the south”. Rivarol even dared to express in front of the Berlin Academy the revolting feelings that people from Latin origins associated with northern languages. Nevertheless, he mitigated his statements by describing the German language as “too rich and too hard at the same time”.He praised the German literature for giving to the world poets and writers of genius. However, as Germany fell behind its neighbours in terms of art and literature, its language faced difficulties in finding a privileged place at the international level. The German language projects an image of “antique and modest” people, too conventional and sedentary. Rivarol finished his critique on Germany by pointing out another argument against a possible development of the German language: the blind tolerance and the warm welcome that the Academy presented to foreign idioms.|$|E

40|$|Le Gothic {{provides}} a valuable corrective {{to the idea}} that Gothic fiction is mainly an Anglo-American phenomenon. Charting numerous influences and appropriations that took place between Europe and America between the late eighteenth and the twentieth centuries, it shows how <b>Gothic</b> <b>writing</b> flourished by crossing national and linguistic boundaries. It traces the importance of revolutionary Paris in the evolution of Gothic and explores cross-channel fertilizations and transatlantic exchanges in film and literature. Opening up new contexts, the contributors offer fresh perspectives on the work of Rousseau, de Sade, Charles Brockden Brown, James Hogg, Victor Hugo, Gaston Leroux, Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe, Huysmans, Machen, T.

40|$|Preoccupied {{with the}} anxieties of modernity, {{academic}} criticism has largely characterized Gothic fiction as a literature {{of fear and}} anxiety - yet most <b>Gothic</b> <b>writing</b> engages with the comic {{in one form or}} another. However, {{in the midst of a}} welter of 'spoofs' and 'ironic slasher movies', 'comic Gothic' has perhaps been easily dismissed as parody in its lower sense. Gothic and the Comic Turn offers a fresh perspective on Gothic fiction, arguing that the value of the comic turn in Gothic texts has been largely overlooked. <b>Gothic</b> <b>writing</b> does indeed express the fragmentation of the modern subject but this expression is characterized by irony, scepticism, and the enjoyment of comic incongruity even as it engages with anguish, fear, isolation and alienation. Tracing an historical trajectory from the late Romantic period through to the late twentieth century, this book examines how varieties of comic parody and appropriation have interrogated the complexities of modern subjectivity. Writers examined include Maria Edgeworth, Eaton Stannard Barrett, E. T. A. Hoffmann, George Meredith, George du Maurier, Djuna Barnes, Evelyn Waugh, Stella Gibbons, Barbara Comyns, Muriel Spark, Iain Banks, Patrick McGrath, Fay Weldon and Angela Carter. ...|$|E
40|$|A popular {{critical}} {{debate in}} recent years has concerned the significance of spectrality in neo-Victorian fiction. With reference to Freud, Derrida, and a range of neo-Victorian authors, this essay argues that the emphasis on {{the ways in which the}} past returns to haunt in the neo-Victorian permits a reading of the psychoanalytic discourse of trauma as a mode of neo-Victorian <b>Gothic</b> <b>writing.</b> By recognising the similarities between these two 'genres', we see how we might use neo-Victorian fiction as a model for developing trauma theory and understanding the ethics of representing traumatic memory and history. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} Emile Habiby's Saraya, The Ghoul's Daughter (1991) and Bharati Mukherjee's Jasmine (1989) as two postcolonial novels seeking {{to rewrite the}} history of Palestinian and Indian diaspora according to their respective myths of Oriental vampires. Habiby's recycling of the Palestinian folktale of the ghoul and Mukherjee's recuperation of the Hindu myth of Lord Shiva aim to spotlight the classical vampiric topoi of otherness, unspeakableness, foreignness, and border existences in colonial and post-colonial contexts. Postcolonial <b>Gothic</b> <b>writing</b> is thus shown to foreground gender, nationality, and ethnicity as sites of both power conflict and cultural exchange.

40|$|In recent years, Gothic {{literary}} studies have increasingly acknowledged {{the role played}} by Shakespeare in authorial acts of appropriation. Such acknowledgement is most prominently stated in Gothic Shakespeares (eds. Drakakis and Townshend, 2008) and Shakespearean Gothic (eds. Desmet and Williams, 2009), both of which base their analyses of the Shakespeare-Gothic intersection on the premise that Shakespearean quotations, characters and events are valuable objects in their own right which mediate on behalf of the ‗present ‘ concerns of the agents of textual appropriation. In light of this scholarship, this thesis argues the case for the presence of ‗Gothic Shakespeare ‘ in <b>Gothic</b> <b>writing</b> during {{the latter half of the}} eighteenth century and, in doing so, it acknowledges the conceptual gap whereby literary borrowings were often denounced as acts of plagiarism.

40|$|Book synopsis: The {{literary}} mode of the Gothic is {{well established}} in English Studies, and there is growing interest in its internationality. Gothic fiction is seen as transgressive, especially {{in the way it}} crosses borders, often illicitly [...] for instance, in the form of plagiarized texts or pseudo-translations of nonexistent sources. In the 1790 s, when the English Gothic novel was emerging, the real or ostensible source of many of these uncanny texts was Germany. This first book in English dedicated to the German Gothic in over thirty years is aimed at students and researchers in German Studies and English Studies, and redresses deficiencies in existing sources, which are outdated, piecemeal, or not sufficiently grounded in German Studies. The book examines the international reception of German Gothic since the 1790 s heyday of the Gothic novel in Britain and Germany; traces a line of <b>Gothic</b> <b>writing</b> in German to the present day; and inquires into the extraliterary impact of German Gothic. Thus the essays do full justice to the Gothic as a site of conflict and exchange [...] both between cultures and between discourses...|$|E
