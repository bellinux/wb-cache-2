40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} current {{knowledge}} about human hair photodamage and the photodegradation mechanisms {{proposed in the}} literature. It is shown {{that there are still}} a number of questions without answer regarding this issue. For example, {{a better understanding of the}} hair structural changes caused by different radiation wavelengths is still lacking. We also <b>find</b> <b>controversies</b> about the effects of sun exposure on different hair types. Explanations to these questions are frequently sustained on the amount and type of melanin of each hair, but factors such as the absence of knowledge of melanin structure and of established methodologies to use in human hair studies make it difficult to reach a general agreement on these issues. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies 2006...|$|E

However, the progressive [...] "co-ed" [...] policies practiced at Genesee would soon <b>find</b> <b>controversy</b> at the new university in Syracuse. Colleges and universities admitted few women students in the 1870s. Administrators and faculty argued women had inferior minds and could not master mathematics and the classics. Dr. Erastus Otis Haven, Syracuse University chancellor and former president of the University of Michigan and Northwestern University, maintained that women should receive the advantages of higher education. He enrolled his daughter, Frances, at Syracuse where she joined the other newly admitted female students in founding the Gamma Phi Beta sorority. The inclusion of women in {{the early days of}} the university led to the proliferation of various women's clubs and societies.

This paper investigates this in detail. The obtained results show that the hot carrier degradation only benefits from an isotope effect when deuterium is introduced in the post metal anneal. At the same time, charge to breakdown for high quality oxides does not benefit from an isotope effect, regardless of the processing stage deuterium is introduced, or the gate oxide thickness used. This is verified on two different sets of wafers fabricated in two different laboratories...|$|R
40|$|Polarization {{of opinion}} is an {{important}} feature of public debate on political, social and cultural topics. The availability of large internet databases of users' ratings has permitted quantitative analysis of polarization trends-for instance, previous studies have included analyses of controversial topics on Wikipedia, {{as well as the}} relationship between online reviews and a product's perceived quality. Here, we study the dynamics of polarization in the movie ratings collected by the Internet Movie database (IMDb) website in relation to films produced over the period 1915 - 2015. We define two statistical indexes, dubbed hard and soft controversiality, which quantify polarized and uniform rating distributions, respectively. We <b>find</b> that <b>controversy</b> decreases with popularity and that hard controversy is relatively rare. Our findings also suggest that more recent movies are more controversial than older ones and we detect a trend of "convergence to the mainstream" with a time scale of roughly 40 - 50 years. This phenomenon appears qualitatively different from trends observed in both online reviews of commercial products and in political debate, and we speculate that it may be connected with the absence of long-lived "echo chambers" in the cultural domain. This hypothesis can and should be tested by extending our analysis to other forms of cultural expression and/or to databases with different demographic user bases.

40|$|AbstractGlobalization mechanisms, the new {{economic}} orientation of Romania after the Communism collapse and as a member state of the European Union have led to several transformations in the mountain rural space, which meant, beside others, changes of the land use, the closing down of the unproductive mines. The {{study was conducted in}} Stulpicani commune, Suceava County, Romanian Carpathians, between 2013 and 2014, where people turned into farming as the only country uranium active mining, nearby was resized and others were decommissioned. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the semi-subsistence farmers’ perception about their farms’ development in the framework of a large return to agriculture due to the declining mining activities, and Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). In order to assess this, a field survey has been applied on 342 house heads of semi-subsistence farms involved in getting specific funding, which was processed in SPSS v. 17 soft through Chi-square test and PCA. The results show that semi-subsistence farms represent still suitable forms of economic development of the Romania's mountain rural areas in consent with traditions and environmental offer.

Responding to Hawass' assertion in the press that Egyptians were not Black or that Egypt was not an African civilization, Keita claims that Hawass' statement obscures the reality of research in the Nile valley that paints a very complex picture and that most people familiar with this research would not get up in front of a group to make such a claim so openly.|$|R

The argument needs to be set in context; the problem they describe is a dilemma of the social sciences as a whole, not just the sociology of scientific knowledge. It is a commonplace among sociologists that attempts at neutral analysis are seen as subversive by dominant ideologies. For example, it is in the interest of states to minimize and disguise social and economic problems. Sociologists who suggest- through the most neutrally intentioned re-search- that things are worse than they appear, are branded as ideologically motivated subversives. This is what gives teeth to the idea that sociology i...|$|R
40|$|In 2010, the Illinois Supreme Court invalidated certain {{statutory}} caps on non-economic {{damages in}} medical cases because they “unduly” infringed “upon the inherent {{power of the}} judiciary. ” Such judicial authority originated within {{the separation of powers}} clause of the Illinois Constitution. The caps were deemed to “encroach” on the judiciary’s “sphere of authority” because they impeded “the courts in the performance of their function. ” Elsewhere, American state statutory damage caps have also been challenged on state constitutional separation of powers grounds. These challenges include settings where the caps operate for non-medical cases and where the limits extend beyond non-economic damages. Given state constitutional diversity, are there core separation of powers principles guiding all American state statutory damage caps? If so, do they apply similarly to all forms of damage caps? With or without such core principles, are there other doctrines, not involving individual rights, that better speak to damage caps? The paper first explores the Illinois precedents on damage caps and separation of powers. Then it examines other state precedents, where it <b>finds</b> the <b>controversies</b> usually involve allocations of civil procedure lawmaking powers. It observes that caps on “statutory causes of action” or during “special proceedings” are often treated differently, as are caps on punitive damages and caps that operate in alternative public forums like administrative agencies. The paper concludes that separation of powers analyses should usually be replaced in damage cap cases with judicial rulemaking analyses. It finds no core principles within state constitutional separation of powers provisions that implicate damage caps. Interstate differences in constitutional allocations of procedural rulemaking authority (and, at times, of justiciable matters) should be recognized more often. This last observation has implications beyond damage caps. Judicial/legislative tensions elsewhere, as with evidence privileges, should also be explored with judicial rulemaking analyses...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the field of}} modeling and hindcasting of the total solar irradiance (TSI) based on different proxy data that extend further back in time than the TSI that is measured from satellites. We introduce a simple method to analyze persistent frequency-dependent correlations (FDCs) between the time series and use these correlations to hindcast missing historical TSI values. We try to avoid arbitrary choices of the free parameters of the model by computing them using an optimization procedure. The method can be regarded as a general tool for pairs of data sets, where correlating and anticorrelating components can be separated into non-overlapping regions in frequency domain. Our method is based on low-pass and band-pass filtering with a Gaussian transfer function combined with de-trending and computation of envelope curves. We <b>find</b> a major <b>controversy</b> between the historical proxies and satellite-measured targets: a large variance is detected between the low-frequency parts of targets, while the low-frequency proxy behavior of different measurement series is consistent with high precision. We also show that even though the rotational signal is not strongly manifested in the targets and proxies, it becomes clearly visible in FDC spectrum. The application of the new method to solar data allows us to obtain important insights into the different TSI modeling procedures and their capabilities for hindcasting based on the directly observed time intervals.

40|$|Since 2015, the {{community}} of extreme event attribution (EEA) has witnessed a scientific controversy between {{what is called a}} " risk-based approach " — estimating how the probability of event occurrence correlates with climate change — and a " storyline approach " — evaluating the influence of climate change on thermodynamic processes leading to the event. We confront those two approaches to the methodologies used in a collection of 105 case studies from 5 BAMS special issues on extreme events. We <b>find</b> that the <b>controversy</b> fails to describe the 1 various ways to perform EEA. In order to go beyond the controversy, we define EEA, based on corpus of interviews conducted with researchers working in the field. EEA is the ensemble of scientific ways to interpret the question " is this event caused by climate change? " and answer it. In order to break down the subtleties of EEA, we decompose this initial question into three main problems a researcher has to deal with when framing an EEA case study. First, one needs to define the event of interest. Then, one has to determine the chain of causality behind the attribution, and the subsequent level of conditioning to parameters of interest. Finally, one has to determine how to represent climate change. We conjecture that the apparent dispute on EEA is connected to its perceived potential use by stakeholders outside of academia, and not to actual scientific practice...|$|R
5000|$|This {{proceeding}} aroused a {{storm of}} indignation among the followers of Maimonides. The communities of Provence, which stood foremost in point of culture, now excommunicated Solomon and his two disciples and hastened to <b>find</b> allies. The <b>controversy</b> became more fierce, the adherents of both parties increasing and growing more bitter; and the discord threatened to spread throughout all Jewry. Many of the rabbis of northern France, frightened at the unexpected consequences, retired from the controversy; but Solomon decided upon a shameful and dangerous step. He went to the Dominican monks; and on a certain day in 1233 the citizens of Montpellier saw servants of the Church, filled with hatred of the Jews and incited by an overpious rabbi, publicly burn {{the works of the}} greatest rabbi of post-Talmudic times. The news of this event filled all the Jews with horror; and Solomon and his pupils were universally condemned, his follower Al-Fakhkhar trying vainly to excuse him. But the matter did not rest there; Solomon, believing that he had gained nothing by destroying the works of Maimonides so long as his admirers were still in the field, denounced them to the authorities. It seems, however, that the Maimonists, with the help of friends in favor at the court of King James I of Aragon, paid Solomon back in his own coin; for several of the calumniators in his party had their tongues cut out. The fate of Solomon himself is not known. Luzzatto infers from the epithet [...] "Ḳadosh" [...] applied to him that he also suffered this shameful mutilation.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{theoretical}} thesis about ethical counselling/psychotherapy. Its {{aim is to}} re-think {{some of the many}} problems that beset the “psy” professions, by addressing some of therapy’s foundational assumptions. It takes the view that these are still expressed in five ethical principles: autonomy, fidelity, justice, non-maleficence and beneficence. It considers this re-thinking a prerequisite to the development of “just” practice in the twenty-first century. Counselling/psychotherapy is still an emerging profession and contains many contradictions and unanswered questions. The thesis begins by foregrounding the ambiguous relationship of therapy to social justice and to the global environment. It describes the range of internal disruptions and discrepancies which the profession contains. It then presents ethical commitment as the uniting factor, and as the topic of study {{for the rest of the}} thesis. The re-thinking draws on a variety of poststructural tools and reviews literature throughout. It takes a discursive approach, drawing in particular on a framework suggested by Foucault in 1968. Each of chapters three to seven focuses on one of the five ethical principles. Each principle is subjected to both a meta-analysis, which locates it within wider discursive contexts and a micro-analysis, which tracks its expression in various versions of the New Zealand Association of Counsellors’ ethical codes. This re-thinking seeks to foreground other “truths” that may have been excluded. The thesis <b>finds</b> that various <b>controversies</b> play a distracting role in a discourse that struggles to exclude immanent relationship with “other things”, including the planet. It finds that therapy continues to play out traditional and oppositional philosophical themes. It finds that morality, expressed rationally as ethics, suffers an erasure. It becomes mis-represented. The thesis ends by proposing a theory of materiality that bridges the gap between discourse analysis and identity politics. It concludes that ethical therapy would do better to free itself from reason’s stranglehold. It calls for an emphasis on dialogic community and the honouring of irrational relationship with the natural environment...|$|R
40|$|In 1985 - 1986, Abilene Christian University endured {{what one}} {{observer}} called the worst attack in “size, nature and intensity” on a university affiliated with Churches of Christ. The flashpoint was whether two biology professors were teaching evolution as fact without refutation. The university denied it, but the controversy raged for two years. Left unanswered {{was the most}} basic of questions: Did ACU professors actually teach evolution without a creationist rebuttal? Which leads to another: Why in 1985 – 130 years after the publication of On the Origin of Species and 60 years after ACU had fired a professor who questioned readings of Genesis – did the controversy erupt? This study attempts to provide those answers. This study answers the first question principally through the use of primary sources – including interviews with those participants still alive and able to relay memories of the events, as well as memos, letters, and notes written by ACU administrators, faculty and students, and by the accusers and their allies. Secondary sources are used to help describe the history of Darwinism among Churches of Christ, especially in the decades leading to the ACU controversy. These sources include previously published material, and articles and letters written by those who were influential in shaping the assumptions of the movement. The study <b>finds</b> that the <b>controversy</b> occurred when it did because of the decades-long assumption among Churches of Christ – reinforced by ACU leaders – that evolution was profoundly anti-Christian. But this attitude was not universally held, especially among science faculty at ACU, who had become increasingly willing to accept aspects of evolution. The study also finds that the accused faculty members did indeed teach evolution as fact without rebuttal in their classes. The semantic ambiguity surrounding the subject, however, allowed the university to issue denials eliding the substance of the evidence presented against the professors. This study concludes that the attack was ultimately unsuccessful in its aims. The same forces that had led to the controversy – an unraveling of the consensus around certain beliefs among Churches of Christ beginning in the 1970 s – also limited the effectiveness of the attacks...|$|R
