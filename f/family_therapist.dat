Using a qualitative research methodology, <b>family</b> <b>therapists</b> were interviewed about the process of the therapy, the relational dynamics, and the personal and professional effects of their experiences. Through thematic analysis, it was found that <b>family</b> <b>therapists</b> are a unique client population who experience increased vulnerability as clients, require heightened sensitivity to boundaries and trust issues, bring forth unique ethical dilemmas, and function in simultaneous dual roles as therapist and client in the therapy room. Based on these findings, the researcher made recommendations for the development of ethical guidelines, impairment remediation programs, and treatment strategies for helping distressed <b>family</b> <b>therapists.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|All U.S. {{state and}} Canadian {{province}} licensing boards {{are members of}} the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) which created and maintains the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP).

Most states also require a certain number of continuing education credits per year in order to renew a license, which can be obtained though various means, such as taking audited classes and attending approved workshops. Clinical psychologists require the Psychologist license to practice, although licenses can be obtained with a masters-level degree, such as Marriage and <b>Family</b> <b>Therapist</b> (MFT), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), and Licensed Psychological Associate (LPA).|$|E

25|$|Cline's privately {{published}} work Hope for high risk and rage filled children also cites <b>family</b> <b>therapist</b> and hypnotherapist Milton Erickson as a source, and reprints {{parts of a}} case of Erickson's published in 1961. The report describes {{the case of a}} divorced mother with a non-compliant son. Erickson advised the mother to sit on the child {{for hours at a time}} and to feed him only on cold oatmeal while she and a daughter ate appetizing food. The child did increase in compliance, and Erickson noted, with apparent approval, that he trembled when his mother looked at him. Cline commented, with respect to this and other cases, that in his opinion all bonds were trauma bonds. According to Cline, it illustrates the three essential components of 1) taking control, 2) the child's expression of rage; and, 3) relaxation and the development of bonding.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} {{sessions}} {{depends on the}} situation, but the average is 5-20 sessions. A <b>family</b> <b>therapist</b> usually meets {{several members of the}} family at the same time. This has the advantage of making differences between the ways family members perceive mutual relations as well as interaction patterns in the session apparent both for the therapist and the family. These patterns frequently mirror habitual interaction patterns at home, even though the therapist is now incorporated into the family system. Therapy interventions usually focus on relationship patterns rather than on analyzing impulses of the unconscious mind or early childhood trauma of individuals as a Freudian therapist would do - although some schools of family therapy, for example psychodynamic and intergenerational, do consider such individual and historical factors (thus embracing both linear and circular causation) and they may use instruments such as the genogram to help to elucidate the patterns of relationship across generations.|$|E
