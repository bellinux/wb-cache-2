5|$|A last {{group of}} sheep breeds {{is that of}} fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. Hair sheep {{are similar to the}} early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> shearing. Hair sheep are also more {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|E
5|$|A {{person can}} obtain more {{or all of}} the {{categories}} at once. But the set of categories needs to be known before the exam and highest score needs to be met. Typically, people obtain E and B category because these two categories provides the best versatility (almost any firearm can be owned and carried concealed). The D category is required by the law for the members of the municipal police (members of the state police <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> license for on duty firearms) and does not itself permit private gun ownership (unless the person obtains also other license category).|$|E
5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size. Resident-type chicks will, if {{provided with the}} same amount of food, grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. Satellite males do not have to expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to be as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.|$|E

5|$|Brachycera are ecologically very diverse, {{with many}} being predatory at the larval stage and some being parasitic. Animals {{parasitised}} include molluscs, woodlice, millipedes, insects, mammals, and amphibians. Flies are {{the second largest}} group of pollinators after the Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and relatives). In wet and colder environments flies are significantly more important as pollinators. Compared to bees, they need less food as they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to provision their young. Many flowers that bear low nectar and those that have evolved trap pollination depend on flies. It is thought {{that some of the}} earliest pollinators of plants may have been flies.|$|E
5|$|In a competition, {{using the}} engine ends the soaring flight. Unpowered gliders are lighter and, as they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> a safety margin for {{starting}} the engine, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions {{will no longer}} support soaring flight, while unpowered gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer.|$|E
5|$|Low-tech {{communication}} {{aids are}} defined as those that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> batteries, electricity or electronics. These are often very simple communication boards or books, from which the user selects letters, words, phrases, pictures, and/or symbols to communicate a message. Depending on physical abilities and limitations, users may indicate the appropriate message with a body part, light pointer, eye-gaze direction, or a head/mouth stick. Alternatively, they may indicate yes or no while a listener scans through possible options.|$|E

Notably, pharmacists <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to participate in CPAs to provide many pharmacy practice services that are already covered by their traditional scope of practice, such as performing medication therapy management, providing disease prevention services (e.g. immunizations), engaging in public health screenings (e.g. screening patients for depressive disorders, such as major depressive disorder, via administering the PHQ-2), providing disease-state specific education (e.g. as a certified diabetes educator), and counseling patients on information regarding their medications.|$|E
5|$|Several hundred frog {{species in}} {{adaptive}} radiations (e.g., Eleutherodactylus, the Pacific Platymantis, the Australo-Papuan microhylids, {{and many other}} tropical frogs), however, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> any water for breeding in the wild. They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, passing through the tadpole stage within the egg. Reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent {{not only on the}} quantity of rainfall, but the seasonal timing.|$|E
5|$|Some enzymes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> {{additional}} {{components to}} show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors {{to be bound}} for activity. Cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). These cofactors serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing nucleophilic species within the active site. Organic cofactors can be either coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase).|$|E
