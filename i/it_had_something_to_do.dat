500|$|Geisel gave varying {{accounts}} {{of how he}} created The Cat in the Hat, but in the version he told most often he was so frustrated with the word list from which he could choose words to write his story {{that he decided to}} scan the list and create a story based on the first two words he found that rhymed. The words he found were cat and hat. The book met with immediate critical acclaim and financial success. Reviewers praised it as an exciting alternative to traditional primers. Three years after its debut, the book had already sold over a million copies, and in 2001 Publishers Weekly listed the book at number nine on its list of best-selling children's books of all time. The book's success {{led to the creation of}} Beginner Books, a publishing house centered on producing similar books for young children learning to read. In 1983, Geisel said, [...] "It is the book I'm proudest of because <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the death of the Dick and Jane primers." [...] The book was adapted into a 1971 animated television special and [...] a 2003 live-action film.|$|E

Without The Cat, Seuss would have {{remained}} a minor light {{in the history of}} children's literature." [...] Donald Pease concurs, writing, [...] "The Cat in the Hat is the classic in the archive of Dr. Seuss stories for which it serves as a cornerstone and a linchpin. Before writing it Geisel was better known for the 'Quick, Henry, the Flit!' ad campaign than for his nine children's books." [...] The publication and popularity of the book thrust Geisel {{into the center of the}} United States literacy debate, what Pease called [...] "the most important academic controversy" [...] of the Cold War era. Academic Louis Menand contends that [...] "The Cat in the Hat transformed the nature of primary education and the nature of children's books. It not only stood for the idea that reading ought to be taught by phonics; it also stood for the idea that language skills—and many other subjects—ought to be taught through illustrated storybooks, rather than primers and textbooks." [...] In 1983, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, [...] "It {{is the book}} I'm proudest of because <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the death of the Dick and Jane primers." ...|$|E

Dalton Trumbo's troubles were that The Hollywood Reporter had publicly named him and a dozen or so other industry professionals as communist sympathizers, and that the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) had seized upon this list as the starting point for their investigation into communist influence in Hollywood. [...] Paulette Goddard was a rising star at Paramount and the studio was heavily invested in her, but she was also at risk of being swept into the HUAC's investigation by virtue of her marriage to actor Burgess Meredith, whose communist affiliations were a matter of record.|$|E

It was originally recorded by Nikola Bedingfield as the title track for her debut EP. Cheryl's A at Polydor had remembered the track and suggested she record it with Braide at his studio. Cheryl was attracted to the song for its lyrics and vibe, saying it [...] "felt right." [...] In an interview with HitQuarters Braide said, [...] " [...] very emotional song.

2500|$|The {{reason for}} Frazier's sudden removal {{from the top}} of the card was never explained, but Kevin Nash (Diesel) implied <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with his wrestling style. Nash said in an {{interview}} with Kayfabe Commentaries that Frazier's style was very reckless and he had little regard for the safety of his fellow wrestlers. Nash said that entering the match at SummerSlam, Frazier had already injured [...] "six or eight" [...] of his colleagues in the ring. Nash said that one of the injuries was to one of the Samoans on the roster (Fatu), which he implied was not easy to do and should have raised a red flag. Nash pointed to Frazier's use of a frequently utilized move by wrestlers of comparable size, the sitdown splash. Most wrestlers who perform this move, such as the aforementioned Fatu (who adopted the move later in his career) and Earthquake, do so without incident as they perform it in such a manner that very little of their body weight actually comes in contact with the opponent's body. Frazier, as described by Nash, would kick his legs out while performing the move and thus did not allow himself to stop before impact, which caused all of Frazier's 500-plus pound body weight to shift to his rear end and land on the opponent. Further, Frazier did not perform the maneuver on an opponent's chest like usual, instead using the move on the lower back of his opponents. With this in mind Nash told Frazier to leave the move out of the match. Frazier disregarded the request and performed the sitdown splash on Nash's lower back anyway, which caused his spine to compress and his core muscles to stretch out and left Nash with a badly strained abdomen that affected his performance the rest of the match, along with the feeling that he had suffered some sort of permanent damage to his spine. Backstage, Nash recounted that a furious Vince McMahon was ready to fire Frazier immediately after the match and was about to hand him his release papers, but Nash stepped in and convinced McMahon otherwise as he did not feel Frazier should lose his job over the incident. However, it is worth mentioning that no other wrestlers when asked about Frazier have agreed with this sentiment.|$|E
