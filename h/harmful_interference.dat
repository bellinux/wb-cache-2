40|$|Abstract—The Spectrum Sensing is a {{fundamental}} function-ality of the Cognitive Radio (CR) paradigm since a reliable detection {{of the presence of}} spectral holes is a mandatory requirement to avoid <b>harmful</b> <b>interferences</b> to licensed users. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a widely linear (WL) cooperative strategy at a fusion center side where the CR user statistics have been received by means of multipath fading channels. The proposed strategy jointly elaborates the received signal and its conjugate version to take advantage by the information contained in the statistical pseudo-covariance function of the received signal. We design the WL strategy to maximize a modified deflection coefficient and we compare it with a strictly linear (SL) cooperative strategy. Results of numerical simulations show that the WL fusion-rule outperforms the SL one in operative conditions of practical interest. I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMinimizing the cross-tier and co-tier {{interferences}} {{while maintaining}} high system throughput or spectrum efficiency {{is one of}} the major fundamental challenges within femtocell networks. Cognitive radio enabled techniques can play a key role in mitigating the interferences effectively by providing more secondary spectrum access opportunities, especially in dense femtocells deployment scenarios. Supported by cognitive radio functionality, femtocell users can access and share the licensed spectra including the frequency bands of both macrocells and other licensed systems (e. g. TV White Spaces) as long as not causing <b>harmful</b> <b>interferences</b> to the coexisting licensed systems. In this paper, based on cognitive sensing, we propose a joint scheme of channel assignment, power allocation and macrocell-femtocell scheduling, so as to minimize the aggregate interferences from the multiple femtocells to the licensed users while taking into account each femtocell's capacity and power budget. Moreover, we come up with the concepts of Physical Cluster (PC) and Virtual Cluster (VC) and synthetically apply the related algorithms to reduce the interferences step by step. Finally, the performances of the proposed algorithms are analyzed, and numerical results have verified the viability and effectiveness of the proposed scheme in managing the femtocell interferences...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we numerically analyze {{the impact of}} interfer-ences in {{wireless}} networks. More particularly, {{the impact on the}} proba-bility of success of a localization algorithm. This problem is particularly relevant in the context of sensor networks. Actually, our numerical exper-iments provide information about this algorithm, even when we do not consider interferences. Indeed, in this case, sharp threshold is observed on the probability of success of the algorithm. Moreover, our numerical computations show that the main <b>harmful</b> <b>interferences</b> are the ones oc-curring between sensors which get localized {{at the same time and}} send in turn their own location. This is demonstrated by varying the time span of the random waiting time before the emissions. We then observe that the longer the waiting time the closer the curves are to the ones obtained without considering interferences. Hence, this proves to be an ecient way of reducing the impact of interferences on the localization algorithm. Moreover, our numerical experiments demonstrate that among the sec-tors of disk with same area, the one with the smaller radius of emission and larger angle of emission is the more appropriate to the localization algorithm. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} resource allocation for a large-scale wireless network consisting of multiple amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative links. To effectively manage interlink interference and achieve efficient resource allocation, we propose a novel two-stage game model in which links form coalitions in the first stage, {{and in the second}} stage, they engage in a noncooperative game given the coalition structure determined in the first stage. This model is distinct from the classic coalitional game theory as it captures the important possibilities of externalities across coalitions. In the coalitional game formulation, we have derived an analytical expression for the asymptotic throughput of an AF cooperative system in the regime of large number of relays and have incorporated opportunistic relaying as an effective technique to combat <b>harmful</b> <b>interferences.</b> In the sequential noncooperative game formulation, the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium has been established for the general N-player case, which generalizes previous works on the two-player game. Simulation results demonstrate over 200 % sum rate enhancement relative to the noncooperative approach, primarily due to the improved pattern of frequency reuse and the benefit of multiuser diversity...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. With the growth of wireless networks such as sensor networks and mesh networks, the challenges of sustaining higher data rates and coverage, coupled with requirement for high quality of services, need to be addressed. The use of spatial diversity proves to be an attractive option due to its ability to significantly enhance network performance without additional bandwidth or transmission power. This thesis proposes the use of cooperative wireless relays to improvise spatial diversity in wireless sensor networks and wireless mesh networks. Cooperation in this context implies that the signals are exchanged between relays for optimal performance. The network gains realised using the proposed cooperative relays for signal forwarding are significantly large, advocating the utilisation of cooperation amongst relays. The work begins with proposing a {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) based relaying strategy that provides improvement in bit error rate. A simplified algorithm has been developed to calculate the roots of a polynomial equation. Following this work, a novel signal forwarding technique based on convex optimisation techniques is proposed which attains specific quality of services for end users with minimal transmission power at the relays. Quantisation of signals passed between relays has been considered in the optimisation framework. Finally, a reduced complexity scheme together with a more realistic algorithm incorporating per relay node power constraints is proposed.
