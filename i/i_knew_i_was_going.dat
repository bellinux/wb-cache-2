2500|$|Stern met {{his first}} wife, Alison Berns, while at Boston University through a mutual friend. He used Berns {{in a student}} film he made about Transcendental Meditation. Stern wrote, [...] "Within a week after our {{relationship}} began, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to marry her." [...] They married at Temple Ohabei Shalom in Brookline, Massachusetts, on June 4, 1978; both were 24 years old. They have three daughters: Emily Beth (b. 1983), Debra Jennifer (b. 1986), and Ashley Jade (b. 1993). In October 1999, they decided to separate. Stern said, [...] "I was totally neurotic and sort of consumed with work. I took work {{as the most important}} thing and the only thing." [...] He moved from the home he shared with Berns in Old Westbury, New York into a 4,000-square-foot apartment in Millennium Tower in the Upper West Side of Manhattan which he bought in 1998 for $4.9 million. The marriage ended in 2001 with an amicable divorce and settlement.|$|E
2500|$|Once in the lead, Barrichello quickly {{opened up}} a {{considerable}} gap back to Schumacher, and by his first pit stop on Lap 27, he led by 12.5 seconds. He returned from the pits in fifth place, behind the two McLarens, as Schumacher returned to the lead. Montoya, meanwhile, was flying as his Michelin tires began to gain traction and provide him an advantage. On Lap 34, just a lap after nearly losing control in Turn 4, Montoya took the lead by outbraking Schumacher down the inside of Turn 1 {{as they approached the}} Minardi of Alex Yoong. [...] "I was trying to get close enough coming into the straight," [...] Montoya said later, [...] "and that time <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get close enough because of traffic. I just went for it." [...] Michael Schumacher said later, [...] "I don't know where he came from." [...] Almost immediately, Montoya built a 2.3-second advantage, recording the fastest lap of the race before pitting on Lap 36 and returning in fifth. Once again, Schumacher led, this time from Häkkinen, with neither car having visited the pits.|$|E
2500|$|At the 6 June Bislett Games in Oslo, a Golden League event, Tirunesh Dibaba set a {{world record}} in the 5000 metres, running the {{distance}} in 14:11.15. Lucy Wangui Kabuu from Kenya ran a personal best and finished in second place, 22 seconds behind Dibaba. Tirunesh's sister Ejegayehu Dibaba finished in third place {{with a time of}} 14:36.78 (4.04 seconds off her personal best). Dibaba bettered Meseret Defar's world record by 5.48 seconds. Tirunesh said after the race, [...] "I've been thinking about {{this for a long time}} and this is a very special day for me. I was trying my best, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to break the record with two laps to go. The early part of the race was pretty good, but at 3000 metres we were a little behind, so then I had to catch up on the pace. I could have run faster if the pacing was a little better." [...] Tirunesh's 800 metre split times were: 2:13.7 - 2:19.0 (4:32.7 through 1600 metres) - 2:22.5 (6:55.2 through 2400 metres and 8:03.7 through 2800 metres) - 2:17.8 (9:13.0 through 3200 metres) - 2:15.4 (11:28.4 through 4000 metres)- 2:10.1 (13.38.5 though 4800 metres), with a last 200 metre split of 32.7.|$|E

Passing the window of the room in which I had left her, I looked back. She had taken her place, at a table before the window, apparently watching for what might happen. There was something about her, as her eyes met mine (I can't say what), which made me feel uneasy at the time. Adopting your view, I am almost inclined to think now, horrid as the idea is, that she had the expectation of seeing me treated as she had been treated in former days. It was actually a relief to me--though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to run a serious risk--to lose sight of her.

I kept as far as I could out of sight, waiting till the talk was over. It was impossible for me to help hearing it. The two men were trying to persuade Geoffrey Delamayn to speak to the elderly gentleman. They pointed to him as a famous medical man.

6000|$|When {{my husband}} returned, {{he asked me}} at dinner if I persevered in my {{resolution}} of leaving England; to which I answered in the affirmative. [...] "Well," [...] says he, [...] "as all my affairs will not take up a week's time to settle, I {{will be ready to}} go from London with you in ten days' time." [...] We fixed upon no particular place or abode, but in general concluded to go to Dover, cross the Channel to Calais, and proceed from thence by easy journeys to Paris, where after staying about a week, we intended to go through part of France, the Austrian Netherlands, and so on to Amsterdam, Rotterdam, or the Hague, as we were to settle before we went from Paris. As my husband did not care to venture all our fortune in one bottom, so our goods, money, and plate were consigned to several merchants, who had been his intimates many years, and he took notes of a prodigious value in his pocket, besides what he gave me to take care of during our journey. The last thing to be considered was, how we should go ourselves, and what equipage we should take with us; my thoughts were wholly taken up about it some time; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be a countess, and did not care to appear anything mean before I came to that honour; but, on the other hand, if I left London in any public way, I might possibly hear of inquiries after me in the road, that I had been acquainted with before. At last I said we would discharge all our servants, except two footmen, who should travel with us to Dover, and one maid to wait on me, that had lived with me only since the retreat of Amy, and she was to go through, if she was willing; and as to the carriage of us, a coach should be hired for my husband, myself, and maid, and two horses were to be hired for the footmen, who were to return with them to London.|$|E
