40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, European {{regional}} policy has developed {{into one of the}} principal areas of EC activity. 1 From the creation of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in 1975, it has developed into the second most important policy area within the EU <b>in</b> <b>budget</b> <b>terms</b> taking up 35 per cent of the EU budget in 2000 (European Commission, 2000). While the European regional policy’s impact on the reduction of regional disparities has remained limited at best (European Commission, 2001) its impact on European governance, i. e. the question of how regional policy should be conducted in Europe, has been much more significant. Reasons for this can be found if one acknowledges the importance of three key dichotomies that have shaped the evolution of the European regional policy regime: (1) development versus compensation; (2) intergovermentalism versus multi-level governance; and (3) cohesion versus competition. A closer analysis of these dichotomies can help to eliminate certain myths that have been persistent in this policy area. First, i...|$|E
40|$|Mexico's private {{toll road}} program of 1989 - 1994 is famous both {{as one of}} the first and the most ambitious highway {{privatization}} programs among the developing countries and {{as one of the}} most dramatic failures. In just five years Mexico awarded 52 concessions totaling over 5300 Â km of toll roads, but as early as 1993 many of the concessions had to be renegotiated and in 1997 the government was forced to takeover 23 of them at an immediate financial cost of billions of dollars. This paper reconsiders the Mexican program and, with the benefit of hindsight, argues that it does not deserve its bad reputation. Although Mexico made some important mistakes in the design of the concessions, many of the highways turned out to be socially worthwhile investments. Moreover, the restructuring of the concessions in 1993 - 1997 converted many of them into financially profitable projects over the long-term, while the 1997 bailout ended up costing the government little <b>in</b> <b>budget</b> <b>terms.</b> Road Concession BOT Bailout Mexico...|$|E
40|$|Some of the {{channels}} {{through which the}} global financial crisis are affecting Nigeria are the reduction in volume of, and price of oil, low commodity prices, exit and reduction in capital flows, cut in tourism, cut in foreign credit lines and low remittances. Reduction in the demand for, and price of, oil in particular is providing a platform for reduced macro-economic performance through its usual channel of government revenue and foreign exchange earnings. <b>In</b> <b>budget</b> <b>terms,</b> {{the average price of}} oil hovered just above US $ 40, less than the benchmark for the 2009 budget. Impact on Nigeria In Nigeria, the budgetary crisis caused by steadily dwindling oil revenue, may make it difficult for the government to put into joint venture operation the US$ 5 billion it allocated for the purpose in the 2009 federal budget of N 3. 1 trillion. Although the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) claims it has, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Finance, secured all the financial instruments necessary to raise the balance of US$ 5. 87 billion required to meet government equity commitment to joint-venture projects in 2009, the global financial climate makes it doubtful if such funding can be successfully accessed. As we go through early 2009, operators will likely take a restrained approach to E&P activities.

Hemispheric contrasts <b>in</b> the energy <b>budget</b> <b>terms</b> are {{used to determine the}} radiative and combined sensible and latent heat contributions to the cross-equatorial heat transports in the atmosphere (AHT_EQ) and ocean (OHT_EQ). The contrast in net atmospheric radiation implies an AHT_EQ from the northern hemisphere (NH) to the southern hemisphere (SH) (0. 75 PW), while the hemispheric difference in sensible and latent heat implies an AHT_EQ in the opposite direction (0. 51 PW), resulting in a net NH to SH AHT_EQ (0. 24 PW). At the surface, the hemispheric contrast in the radiative component (0. 95 PW) dominates, implying a 0. 44 PW SH to NH OHT_EQ. Coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP 5) models with excessive net downward surface radiation and surface-to-atmosphere sensible and latent heat transport in the SH relative to the NH exhibit anomalous northward AHT_EQ and overestimate SH tropical precipitation. The hemispheric bias in net surface radiative flux is due to too much longwave surface radiative cooling in the NH tropics in both clear and all-sky conditions and excessive shortwave surface radiation in the SH subtropics and extratropics due to an underestimation in reflection by clouds...|$|R

Energy budgets for areas that enclose regions of intense convection are shown to have systematic changes {{that relate to the}} life cycles of the convection. Some of the synoptic-scale energy processes associated with the convection are found to be larger than those observed in the vicinity of mature cyclones. Volumes enclosing intense convection are found to have large values of cross-contour conversion of potential to kinetic energy and large horizontal export of kinetic energy. Although small net vertical transport of kinetic energy is observed, values at individual layers indicate large upward transport. Transfer of kinetic energy from grid to subgrid scales of motion occurs in the volumes. Latent heat release is large in the middle and upper troposphere and is thought to be the cause of the observed cyclic changes <b>in</b> the <b>budget</b> <b>terms.</b> Total potential energy is found to be imported horizontally in {{the lower half of the}} atmosphere, transported aloft, and then exported horizontally.
