5|$|No {{news about}} the game was made {{available}} for 18 months after it was initially announced. Davis thought the game was announced too early, causing excitement for it to die <b>down</b> <b>too</b> far from the release date. The developers carried out focus tests during this period, and the gameplay {{was found to be}} too slow-paced compared to competitors such as Call of Duty. As a result, the team spent time to speed up the game's action so that it would more closely match the narrative.|$|E

25|$|The {{accident}} investigation determined {{the causes of}} the accident were that the crew touched <b>down</b> <b>too</b> far down the runway, at too high a speed, following a non-stabilised approach, and that they failed to properly utilise the aircraft's brake and reverse thrust systems, which resulted in their being unable to stop the aircraft within the available runway and overrun distance.|$|E
25|$|Transmembrane α-helical {{proteins}} are unusually stable {{judging from}} thermal denaturation studies, {{because they do}} not unfold completely within the membranes (the complete unfolding would require breaking <b>down</b> <b>too</b> many α-helical H-bonds in the nonpolar media). On the other hand, these proteins easily misfold, due to non-native aggregation in membranes, transition to the molten globule states, formation of non-native disulfide bonds, or unfolding of peripheral regions and nonregular loops that are locally less stable.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} {{was found to be}} pilot error. The aircraft had not been in a stable approach, landed at too high a speed, and touched <b>down</b> <b>too</b> far along the runway to have sufficient distance available in which to stop. The location where the aircraft ended up meant that the post-crash fire was exacerbated. Only one of the three fire engines had a key to the gate, which delayed their arrival at the crash site. Subsequent to this accident, the airport operator has ensured that all fire engines are provided with keys to all gates they need access to. All four on board the aircraft survived the accident, but were killed by the post-crash fire.|$|E

25|$|Gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus (GDV), {{also known}} as bloat, is the greatest killer of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. GDV occurs in deep-chested breeds and requires immediate veterinary care. It {{can be caused by}} wolfing <b>down</b> <b>too</b> much water, too much food too fast, exercise after eating, stress or unknown conditions. Symptoms are distended abdomen, excessive salivating, depression and lethargy. When GDV occurs it cuts off the esophagus, and blood supply to the heart is lessened causing low blood pressure as well as other cardiac problems; the dog can go into shock. Organ damage can occur as well and the stomach may rupture causing peritonitis to set in. If not treated, the dog may die.|$|E
25|$|The real {{exchange}} rate appreciated through 1981 and 1982, public sector investment rose 54 percent {{in real terms}} from 1979 to 1982, and public sector consumption rose 25 percent during the same three-year period. The combination effectively turned the current-account surplus into a large deficit, as increased spending plus import liberalization practically doubled imports {{of goods and services}} between 1979 and 1981. The appreciation also turned manufacturing exports back downward, and a plunge in external prices of primary exports brought them <b>down</b> <b>too.</b> And then the mistake of focusing on the earlier export surplus as the main cause of inflation became clear: the increases in spending led to a leap of inflation despite the return to an external deficit. The rate of inflation went from 59 percent in 1980 to 111 percent by 1983.|$|E
25|$|Yoke valves (sometimes called A-clamps {{from their}} shape) {{are the most}} popular {{regulator}} connection in North America and several other countries. They clamp the high pressure inlet opening of the regulator against the outlet opening of the cylinder valve, and are sealed by an O-ring in a groove in the contact face of the cylinder valve. The user screws the clamp in place finger-tight to hold the metal surfaces of cylinder valve and regulator first stage in contact, compressing the o-ring between the radial faces of valve and regulator. When the valve is opened, gas pressure presses the O-ring against the outer cylindrical surface of the groove, completing the seal. The diver must take care not to screw the yoke <b>down</b> <b>too</b> tightly, or it may prove impossible to remove without tools. Conversely, failing to tighten sufficiently can lead to O-ring extrusion under pressure and a major loss of breathing gas. This can be a serious problem if it happens when the diver is at depth.|$|E

25|$|The old fleurs-de-lis, {{especially}} the ones {{found in our}} first kings' sceptres, have a lot less in common with ordinary lilies than the flowers called flambas , or irises, from which the name of our own fleur-de-lis may derive. What gives some colour of truth to this hypothesis that we already put forth, {{is the fact that}} the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named Leie in the Flanders. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises —as many plants grow for centuries in the same places—: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of lis. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, bend down so that the middle one seems to make one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals bend <b>down</b> <b>too</b> when the flower blooms.|$|E

500|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the film}} {{shattered}} attendance records at the London Plaza Cinema, but nearly all British critics gave it poor reviews, questioning Hitchcock's taste and judgment. Reasons cited for {{this were the}} critics' late screenings, forcing them to rush their reviews, their dislike of the gimmicky promotion, and Hitchcock's expatriate status. Perhaps thanks to the public's response and Hitchcock's efforts at promoting it, the critics did a re-review, and the film was praised. TIME switched its opinion from [...] "Hitchcock bears <b>down</b> <b>too</b> heavily in this one" [...] to [...] "superlative" [...] and [...] "masterly", and Bosley Crowther put it on his Top Ten list of 1960.|$|E

[...] He perceived that Patrick [...] "has been dumbed <b>down</b> <b>too</b> far." [...] As for the character of SpongeBob, he criticized his changing voice that has become [...] "more nasal over the years."

500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch.

On the choice of not working with a producer, frontman Chris Cornell said that [...] "a fifth guy is too many cooks and convolutes everything.

[...] Drummer Matt Cameron added that while working with Michael Beinhorn in Superunknown had good results, it was [...] "a little more of a struggle than it needed to be", and self-production would make the process go faster. Adam Kasper, who previously had worked with Soundgarden as an assistant engineer on Superunknown, worked with the band as a production collaborator and mixed the album.|$|E
