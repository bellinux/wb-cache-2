The similarity of both concepts is a pathway of two actions: 1) reduce energy demand by means of energy efficiency measures and passive energy use; 2) generate energy from renewable sources. However, the Net ZEBs grid interaction and plans to widely increase their numbers evoke considerations on increased flexibility in the shift of energy loads and reduced peak demands.|$|E

50|$|In August 2014 Ukrtransgaz, the {{operator}} of the Ukrainian gas transport system, {{along with its}} Slovakian counterpart Eustream, launched natural gas supplies from Slovakia to Ukraine after signing a Memo of mutual understanding in April. This initiative was driven by Russia’s decision in June to cease gas supplies to Ukraine {{in retaliation for the}} country seeking closer ties with the European Union. By launching reverse flows, Ukraine claims it is seeking no concessions - only implementation of existing EU law on EU territory. The Third Energy Package was proposed by the European Commission in 2007 and adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in July 2009. This legislation clearly allows for gas to be traded like other commodities, thus creating a more efficient market which is less vulnerable to political pressure.

5000|$|Early {{development}} of wind energy in Canada was located primarily in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta. Throughout the late 1990s and {{early years of}} the 21st Century every Canadian province has pursued wind power to supplement their provincial <b>energy</b> <b>grids.</b> Alberta built the first commercial wind farm in Canada in 1993. British Columbia was the last province to add wind power to its grid with the completion of the Bear Mountain Wind Park in November 2009. With increasing population growth, Canada has seen wind power as a way to diversify energy supplies away from traditional reliance on fossil fuel burning thermal plants and heavy reliance on hydroelectricity in some provinces. In provinces like Nova Scotia, where only 12% of electricity comes from renewable sources, the {{development of}} wind energy projects will provide a measure of electricity security that some jurisdictions are lacking. In the case of British Columbia, wind energy will help close the electricity deficit that the province is facing into the 2010s and help reduce the reliance on importing power from other jurisdictions that may not use renewable energy sources.An additional 2,004 megawatts of wind power is to come on stream in Quebec between 2011 and 2015.
