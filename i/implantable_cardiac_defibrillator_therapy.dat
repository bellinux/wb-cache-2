40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{examined}} the relationship between diabetes mellitus and outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. BACKGROUNDAlthough diabetes is associated with poor outcomes after CABG surgery among unselected patients, the relationship between diabetes and mortality after CABG surgery among patients with LV dysfunction is less certain. METHODSUsing data from The CABG Patch Trial, a study of <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapy,</b> we analyzed 900 patients with ejection fraction < 0. 36 who underwent CABG surgery from 1990 to 1996. RESULTSDiabetics comprised 38 % of the patients, and 48 % of diabetics were prescribed insulin. Diabetes was associated with hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of stroke, clinical heart failure and rales on physical exam. Diabetics were at higher risk for postoperative superficial sternal wound infection and renal failure. With an average follow-up time of 32 ± 16 months, actuarial all-cause mortality 48 months after CABG surgery was 26 % in diabetics and 24 % in nondiabetics (p = 0. 66, log-rank test). Diabetes was not associated with long-term mortality in Cox multiple regression analyses. Actuarial re-hospitalization rates 48 months after CABG surgery were 85 % in diabetics and 69 % in nondiabetics (p = 0. 0001, log-rank test). Diabetics had a 44 % higher risk of re-hospitalization for any cause (p = 0. 0001) and a 24 % higher risk of re-admission for cardiac causes (p < 0. 05). Unexpectedly, fewer arrhythmic events were found in diabetics. CONCLUSIONSDiabetes was not a predictor of mortality after CABG surgery among patients with LV dysfunction despite associated comorbidities. However, diabetes was associated with increased postoperative complications and re-hospitalization...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the efficacy of <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>defibrillator</b> (ICD) <b>therapy</b> in preventing sudden cardiac death (SCD) in post-infarction patients with advanced left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. BackgroundThe Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT-II) randomized 1, 232 post-infarction patients with an ejection fraction of ≤ 30 % to ICD or conventional therapy. In the ICD group, there was a 31 % decrease in the risk of total mortality. However, a better understanding of the mode of death is desirable in order to refine therapeutic interventions in high-risk populations. MethodsWe evaluated the 202 deaths, using a variation of the Hinkle-Thaler classification system as well as a clinical classification system to determine the incidence of SCD and the incidence of cardiac death due to progressive LV failure. ResultsThe SCD rates were 10. 0 % in the conventional group and 3. 8 % in the ICD group (p < 0. 01). The hazard ratio for the risk of SCD in the ICD group compared with the conventional therapy group was 0. 33 (95 % confidence interval 0. 20 to 0. 53, p < 0. 0001). The ICD had no meaningful effect on non-sudden death (p = 0. 32). The effect of <b>defibrillator</b> <b>therapy</b> in reducing SCD was similar in subgroup analyses stratified according to relevant baseline characteristics. ConclusionsThe decrease in mortality with ICD therapy in MADIT-II is entirely due to a reduction in SCD, with similar reductions in SCD in a spectrum of subgroups stratified according to relevant baseline characteristics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESTo {{assess the}} {{clinical}} significance of inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias among patients with unexplained syncope. BACKGROUNDInduction of sustained ventricular arrhythmias at electrophysiology study {{in patients with}} unexplained syncope and structural heart disease is usually assigned diagnostic significance. However, the true frequency of subsequent spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias {{in the absence of}} antiarrhythmic medications is unknown. METHODSIn a retrospective case-control study, the incidence of <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>defibrillator</b> (ICD) <b>therapies</b> for sustained ventricular arrhythmias among patients with unexplained syncope or near syncope (syncope group, n = 22) was compared with that of a control group of patients (n = 32) with clinically documented sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Sustained ventricular arrhythmias were inducible in both groups and neither group received antiarrhythmic medications. All ICDs had stored electrograms or RR intervals. Clinical variables were similar between groups except that congestive cardiac failure was more common in the syncope group. RESULTSKaplan-Meier analysis of the time to first appropriate ICD therapy for syncope and control groups produced overlapping curves (p = 0. 9), with 57 ± 11 % and 50 ± 9 %, respectively, receiving ICD therapy by one year. In both groups, the induced arrhythmia was significantly faster than spontaneous arrhythmias, but the cycle lengths of induced and spontaneous arrhythmias were positively correlated (R = 0. 6, p < 0. 0001). During follow-up, three cardiac transplantations and seven deaths occurred in the syncope group, and two transplantations and five deaths occurred in the control group (36 -month survival without transplant 52 ± 11 % and 83 ± 7 %, respectively, p = 0. 03). CONCLUSIONSIn patients with unexplained syncope, structural heart disease and inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias, spontaneous sustained ventricular arrhythmias occur commonly and at a similar rate to patients with documented sustained VT. Thus, electrophysiologic testing in unexplained syncope can identify those at risk of potentially life-threatening tachyarrhythmias, and aggressive treatment of these patients is warranted...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{association}} between influenza vaccination and <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>defibrillator</b> (ICD) <b>therapies</b> during influenza season {{is not known}} and is described in this study. Understanding this association is important since reduction in ICD therapies during influenza season via use of influenza vaccination would benefit patients physically and psychologically. MethodsPatients presenting to the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center ICD clinic between September 1 st, 2011 and November 31 st, 2011 {{were asked to complete}} a survey evaluating their use of the influenza vaccine. The number of patients with any ICD therapy and the total number of ICD therapies in the six months before and the three months during the 2010 – 2011 influenza season were determined. Poisson regression analysis was employed to assess differences in the average number of ICD therapies received during the influenza season based on vaccine status (vaccinated vs. unvaccinated). The analysis was repeated after limiting the cohort to patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35 %. ResultsA total of 229 patients completed the survey, 78 % of whom received the influenza vaccine. Four patients had more than one ICD shock during the study period. Electrical storm was rare (n= 2). A trend toward more ICD therapies (unadjusted incident rate ratio (IRR) = 3. 2; P= 0. 07) and appropriate ICD shocks (unadjusted IRR= 9. 0; P= 0. 17) was noted for unvaccinated compared to vaccinated patients. This association persisted when analysis was limited to patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35 % (all ICD therapies: unadjusted IRR= 5. 8; P= 0. 045; adjusted IRR= 2. 6; P= 0. 33). No patient who received the influenza vaccine, and had a reduced ejection fraction, received an approprite ICD shock during influenza season (unadjusted P< 0. 002). ConclusionA trend toward more ICD therapies during influenza season was observed in patients who did not receive the influenza vaccine compared to those who did. The association was stronger in patients who received appropriate ICD shocks and in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Further work to confirm these findings is recommended...|$|R
