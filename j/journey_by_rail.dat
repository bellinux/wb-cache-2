2500|$|For {{the third}} convention, the city hall in Syracuse, New York was {{selected}} as the site. Because Syracuse was nearer to Seneca Falls (two days' travel by horse, several hours' <b>journey</b> <b>by</b> <b>rail),</b> more of the original signers of the Declaration of Sentiments were able to attend than the previous two conventions in Massachusetts. Lucretia Mott was named president; at one point she felt it necessary to silence a minister who offended the assembly by using biblical references to keep women subordinate to men. A letter from Elizabeth Cady Stanton was read and its resolutions voted on. At sessions taking place September 8–10, 1852, Susan B. Anthony and Matilda Joslyn Gage made their first public speeches on women's rights. Ernestine Rose spoke denouncing duties without rights, saying [...] "as a woman has to pay taxes to maintain government, she has a right to participate in the formation and administration of it." [...] Antoinette Brown called for more women to become ministers, claiming that the Bible did not forbid it. Ernestine Rose stood up in response, saying that the Bible should not be used as the authority for settling a dispute, especially as it contained much contradiction regarding women. Elizabeth Oakes Smith called for women to have their own journal so that they could become independent of the male-owned press, saying [...] "We should have a literature of our own, a printing press and a publishing house, and tract writers and distributors, as well as lectures and conventions; and yet I say this to a race of beggars, for women have no pecuniary resources." [...] Antoinette Brown lectured about how masculine law can never fully represent womankind. Lucy Stone wore a trousered dress often referred to as [...] "bloomers", a more practical style she had picked up during the summer after meeting Amelia Bloomer. She spoke to say [...] "The woman who first departs from the routine in which society allows her to move must suffer.

60|$|Meanwhile the {{concentration}} was proceeding. All {{the troops in}} Dongola, {{with the exception of}} scanty garrisons in Merawi, Korti, and Debba, were massed at Berber. The infantry and guns, dropping down the river in boats, entrained at Kerma, were carried back to Halfa, then hustled across the invaluable Desert Railway, past Abu Hamed, and finally deposited at Railhead, which then (January 1) stood at Dakhesh. The whole <b>journey</b> <b>by</b> <b>rail</b> from Merawi to Dakhesh occupied four days, whereas General Hunter with his flying column had taken eight--a fact which proves that, in certain circumstances which Euclid could not have foreseen, two sides of a triangle are together shorter than the third side. The Egyptian cavalry at Merawi received their orders on the 25th of December, and the British officers hurried from their Christmas dinners to prepare for their long march across the bend of the Nile to Berber. Of the eight squadrons, three were pushed on to join Lewis's force at the position which will hereinafter be called 'the Atbara encampment,' or more familiarly 'the Atbara'; three swelled the gathering forces at Berber; and two remained for the present in the Dongola province, looking anxiously out towards Gakdul Wells and Metemma.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Mapleside {{lived in}} a pretty little house on the terrace {{overlooking}} the market-place; and when I arrived that evening, she received me with an almost motherly affection and interest. She would hardly allow me to go upstairs, to take my things off.

For the last fifty years she had never been beyond Whitstable or Ramsgate, to one or other of which places she made an expedition for a fortnight or so every two years; always going in the coach, as long as coaches ran, and after that in some friend's carriage; for the railway to her was a terrible monster, and nothing would convince her that collisions and catastrophes of all sorts were not its normal state of being. She expressed her gratitude to Providence most warmly that I should have been preserved from destruction on the way, and seemed to think that an almost special dispensation had taken place in my favour.|$|E
60|$|In the morning-room of his sister-in-law's house Groby Lington fidgeted {{away the}} passing minutes with the demure restlessness of {{advanced}} middle age. About {{a quarter of}} an hour would have to elapse before it would be time to say his good-byes and make his way across the village green to the station, with a selected escort of nephews and nieces. He was a good-natured, kindly dispositioned man, and in theory he was delighted to pay periodical visits to the wife and children of his dead brother William; in practice, he infinitely preferred the comfort and seclusion of his own house and garden, and the companionship of his books and his parrot to these rather meaningless and tiresome incursions into a family circle with which he had little in common. It was not so much the spur of his own conscience that drove him to make the occasional short <b>journey</b> <b>by</b> <b>rail</b> to visit his relatives, as an obedient concession to the more insistent but vicarious conscience of his brother, Colonel John, who was apt to accuse him of neglecting poor old William's family. Groby usually forgot or ignored the existence of his neighbour kinsfolk until such time as he was threatened with a visit from the Colonel, when he would put matters straight by a hurried pilgrimage across the few miles of intervening country to renew his acquaintance with the young people and assume a kindly if rather forced interest in the well-being of his sister-in-law. On this occasion he had cut matters so fine between the timing of his exculpatory visit and the coming of Colonel John, that he would scarcely be home before the latter was due to arrive. Anyhow, Groby had got it over, and six or seven months might decently elapse before he need again sacrifice his comforts and inclinations on the altar of family sociability. He was inclined to be distinctly cheerful as he hopped about the room, picking up first one object, then another, and subjecting each to a brief bird-like scrutiny.|$|E
500|$|Lincoln faced {{three major}} opponents. A {{split in the}} Democratic Party had led northerners to {{nominate}} Senator Douglas, while southerners chose Vice President John C. Breckinridge. The Constitutional Union Party, a new party consisting mostly of former Southern Whigs, selected former Tennessee senator John Bell. As Lincoln would not even be {{on the ballot in}} ten southern states, he needed to win almost every northern state to take the presidency. Douglas was said to be strong in Illinois and Indiana, and if he took those, the election might be thrown into the House of Representatives. Seward was urged to undertake a campaign tour of the Midwest in support of Lincoln and did so for five weeks in September and October, attracting huge crowds. He <b>journeyed</b> <b>by</b> <b>rail</b> and boat as far north as Saint Paul, Minnesota, into the border state of Missouri at St. Louis, and even to Kansas Territory, though it had no electoral votes to cast in the election.

60|$|All this inculcated adult docility, which wrecks every civilization {{as it is}} {{wrecking}} ours, is inhuman and unnatural. We must reconsider our {{institution of}} the Coming of Age, which is too late for some purposes, and too early for others. There should be a series of Coming of Ages for every individual. The mammals have their first coming of age when they are weaned; and {{it is noteworthy that}} this rather cruel and selfish operation {{on the part of the}} parent has to be performed resolutely, with claws and teeth; for your little mammal does not want to be weaned, and yields only to a pretty rough assertion of the right of the parent to be relieved of the child as soon as the child is old enough to bear the separation. The same thing occurs with children: they hang on to the mother's apron-string and the father's coat tails as long as they can, often baffling those sensitive parents who know that children should think for themselves and fend for themselves, but are too kind to throw them on their own resources with the ferocity of the domestic cat. The child should have its first coming of age when it is weaned, another when it can talk, another when it can walk, another when it can dress itself without assistance; and when it can read, write, count money, and pass an examination in going a simple errand involving a purchase and a <b>journey</b> <b>by</b> <b>rail</b> or other public method of locomotion, it should have quite a majority. At present the children of laborers are soon mobile and able to shift for themselves, whereas it is possible to find grown-up women in the rich classes who are actually afraid to take a walk in the streets unattended and unprotected. It is true that this is a superstition from the time when a retinue was part of the state of persons of quality, and the unattended person was supposed to be a common person of no quality, earning a living; but this has now become so absurd that children and young women are no longer told why they are forbidden to go about alone, and have to be persuaded that the streets are dangerous places, which of course they are; but people who are not educated to live dangerously have only half a life, and are more likely to die miserably after all than those who have taken all the common risks of freedom from their childhood onward as matters of course.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} working class railway excursions {{in the setting}} of Oldham and Saddleworth; a relatively small area close to Manchester that sits Janus-like between industrial East Lancashire and West Yorkshire, with the Pennines and open moorland forming a natural border. To put the work into context, it concentrates on the evolution of excursions as a social institution in the area, from a point when railways were established in 1830 until 1915 by which time such journeys were diminishing with the advent of alternative modes of travel and destinations. All of which encouraged many working class people to look further afield for their leisure activities. These two ostensibly different areas were linked by the trans-Pennine railways that connected parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire from 1842 onwards. The study uses research criteria into the complex interaction between availability, accessibility and affordability in the evaluation of railway excursions. Availability {{comes in the form of}} the establishment of rail links to and from the area that offered opportunities for a new type of travel and to experience new spaces. Accessibility considers the time constraints placed on workers as they moved from a home based economy to that of industrialization with a restriction on their leisure time and subsequent progress on how they were overcome. Affordability briefly considers the economics of excursions and excursionists that ensured the development of this type of leisure. The study also acknowledges the continuity and change of some forms of leisure activities from ca 1830 although their developments are by no means exclusive to one-day <b>journeys</b> <b>by</b> <b>rail.</b> ...|$|R

Should we not persuade the organizations in Dublin and in London, when the time drew near for the unveiling of our statue, or even perhaps for the laying of its foundation stone, to invite the leaders of Parnellite or Anti-Parnellite, of the new group of Unionists who had almost changed sides in their indignation at the over-taxation of Ireland, to lay their policy before our Convention--could we not then propose and carry that the Convention sit permanently, or appoint some Executive Committee to direct Irish policy and report from time to time. The total withdrawal from Westminster had been proposed in the 'Seventies, before the two devouring heads were of equal strength, {{and now that the}} abstract head seemed the strongest, would be proposed again, but the Convention could send them thither, not as an independent power, but as its delegation, and only when, and for what purpose the Convention might decide. I dreaded some wild Fenian movement, and with literature perhaps more in my mind than politics, dreamed of that Unity of Culture which might begin with some few men controlling some form of administration. I began to talk my project over with various organizers, who often interrupted their attention which was perhaps only politeness, with some new jibe at Mr. Dillon or Mr. Redmond. I thought I had Maud Gonne's support, but when I overheard her conversation, she commonly urged the entire withdrawal of the Irish Members, or if she did refer to my scheme, it was to suggest the sending to England of eighty ragged and drunken Dublin beggars or eighty pugilists [...] "to be paid by results." ...|$|R

As Carton de Wiart comments in his book, [...] "I learnt also that twenty-four hours elapsed before our exit hole had been discovered, and then only by Gussie's dog (Mickey, a cross St Bernard & white sheep-dog). Gussie (as Lieutenant Agosto Ricciardi their previous Italian guard and Gaoler was known) had left it behind when he had been sent away, but the dog proved too intimate a friend to us, and had unwittingly given away our secret."A new camp commander was appointed and the garrison was increased by fifty-percent - there were now some hundred infantry and Carabinieri to guard eleven officers and fourteen other ranks. The final and successful escape was not made until after the Italian surrender in September 1943. However, in the preceding months, the inmates of the castle had through MI9 contacts continued to receive parcels with much concealed escape material including over 20,000 lire in Italian money, various maps, compasses and some clothing material.|$|R
