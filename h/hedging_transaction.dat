40|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} approaches to option hedging with transaction costs is the utility-based approach, pioneered by Hodges and Neuberger [Rev. Futures Markets, 1989, 8, 222 - 239]. Judging against the best possible trade-off between the risk and the costs of a hedging strategy, this approach seems to achieve excellent empirical performance. However, this approach has one major drawback that prevents the broad application of this approach in practice: the lack of a closed-form solution. We overcome this drawback by presenting a simple yet efficient analytic approximation of the solution. We provide an empirical testing of our approximation strategy against the asymptotic and some other well-known strategies and find that our strategy outperforms all the others.

40|$|We {{consider}} optimal hedging {{decisions for}} a firm whose stock returns {{are affected by}} market returns and an idiosyncratic factor that is orthogonal to the market return. We show {{that the level of}} firm’s cash flows depend on the level of the market and the level of the idiosyncratic factor multiplicatively because of compounding. Minimizing the variance of the cash flow requires a substantial offsetting position in the market index. However, minimizing the costs of financial distress associated with low cash flow realizations is complex and requires only a modest hedge against the market factor. This insight holds even in continuous time and with dynamic hedging policies. We clarify that using return regressions to measure economic exposure to generate optimal hedging deltas is erroneous and that <b>hedging</b> <b>transaction</b> exposure to idiosyncratic risks such as exchange risks is sensible...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{theoretical}} {{work has}} been devoted to the problem of option pricing and hedging with transaction costs. A variety of methods have been suggested and are currently being used for dynamic hedging of options in the presence of transaction costs. However, very little was done on the subject of an empirical comparison of different methods for option hedging with transaction costs. In a few existing studies the different methods are compared by studying their empirical performances in hedging only a plain-vanilla short call option. The reader is tempted to assume that the ranking of the different methods for hedging any kind of option remains the same as that for a vanilla call. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} show that the ranking of the alternative hedging strategies depends crucially on the type of the option position being hedged and the risk preferences of the hedger. In addition, we present and implement a simple optimization method that, in some cases, improves considerably the performance of some hedging strategies.

40|$|This {{paper was}} printed using funds made {{available}} by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. Abstract: We propose {{a new approach to}} the pricing and hedging of contingent claims under transaction costs in a general incomplete market in discrete time. Under the assumptions of a bounded mean-variance tradeoff, substantial risk and a nondegeneracy condition on the conditional variances of asset returns, we prove the existence of a locally risk-minimizing strategy inclusive of transaction costs for every square-integrable contingent claim. Then we show that local risk-minimization is robust under the inclusion of transaction costs: The preceding strategy which is locally risk-minimizing inclusive of transaction costs in a model with bid-ask spreads on the underlying asset is also locally risk-minimizing with-out transaction costs in a fictitious model which is frictionless and where the fictitious asset price lies between the bid and ask price processes of the original model. In particular, our results apply to any nondegenerate model with a finite state space if the transaction cost parameter is sufficiently small.

40|$|A {{survey on}} {{derivative}} usage and {{financial risk management}} in New Zealand shows that the currency forward is {{the most frequently used}} derivatives in <b>hedging</b> <b>transaction</b> exposure. This paper examines whether forwards performs better than over-the-counter option for a New Zealand exporter in hedging NZD/USD transaction exposure. This research adopts Hsin, Kuo and Lee’s (1994) model of hedging effectiveness which maximizes the exporter’s expected negative exponential utility function to compare and evaluate the ex-ante hedging effectiveness of both forwards and options synthetic forwards. The results show that prior to the 1997 Asian Crisis, forwards are marginally more effective than options synthetic forwards for an ordinary risk-averse exporter to hedge against her/his 1, 3, 6 and 12 -month transaction exposures. However, during and after the 1997 Asian Crisis, options synthetic forwards are more effective than forwards for hedging exposures of 1, 3 and 6 months. The results are robust to the exporter’s degree of absolute risk aversion (JEL G 1, G 11).

40|$|Companies {{especially}} multinational {{companies are}} now exposed to risks caused by unexpected movements in exchange rate. The management of foreign exchange risk has become essential {{for the survival of}} companies in today’s volatile financial markets. This paper reviews the traditional types of exchange rate risk faced by firms, namely translation, transaction and operating risk, presents measurement and management method for foreign exchange exposure and objectives of foreign exchange management. The central purpose of this thesis is to examine the foreign exchange risk management in American, Japanese and Chinese companies by comparing hedging practices among 30 companies, of which are 10 from each country. We approach our research by analyzing the annual report of our sample companies in the year of 2006, it is found that American and Japanese companies tend to hedge foreign exchange risk more than Chinese companies, also have more diversity of derivatives usage. Although China has reformed the exchange rate policy from pegging US dollar to a managed floating exchange rate system recently, it is still suggested that Chinese firms are less active than American and Japanese firms in the foreign exchange management activity. After we did our research, we found the companies always put focus on <b>hedging</b> <b>transaction</b> risk, the companies in China prefer to use home country currency as function currency while American and Japanese companies prefer to use domestic currency as function currency. So after we did our analysis, we feel that in China, the company need to reinforce the consciousness to hedge exchange rate risk, use diversification instrument to hedge foreign exchange risk and doing adjustment in accounting rules in translation of foreign currencies. For very little have been investigated on financial risk management in Chinese companies, we wish our study can contribute to the foreign exchange risk management research...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{thesis is}} {{addressing}} the inventory valuation method called moving average {{and how this}} inventory method handles exchange rate differences. Intentions {{of the study is}} also to highlight differences and similarities between the two methods standard cost and moving average. This study fills an existing gap in science regarding pros and cons with the moving average method which made the topic very interesting.   It also has strong practical contribution regarding possible benefits and problems of relevance to companies that have intentions of implementing moving average on their inventory. The relationships between foreign exchange rate risks and inventory leads to the formulated research question for this thesis: What are the effects of currency movements in the cost of goods sold from an inventory valued at moving average method? Based on the technical problem statement was a constructive approach and interpretive standpoint considered best suited for the study. The gathering of data was conducted by using a qualitative research strategy. Three different topics are used in the theoretical frame; inventory valuation, exchange rates and hedging. The theoretical frame describes the accounting standards behind inventory valuation and exchange rates, as well as the theories addressed. Third and final topic hedging is about how to manage exchange rate exposures using different hedging techniques. The in-depth investigation was made for four business units with inventories valued according to the moving average method. Sampling was divided into two parts one for the companies and another choosing respondents. Selection of companies was a convenient sample within the non-probability samples used and the respondents were selected using a snowball sample. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine respondents. Both the empirical- and analysis chapter follows the same three topics as the theory structure and the empirical answers are divided into companies to facilitate the comparison. A short summary of the analysis is that moving average is most suitable for inventories with; high inventory turnovers, sales from shelf and stable costs. There is a need to identify input costs to manage exchange rate differences correctly. The final part about hedging showed that different exposures need different hedging techniques. Forward contracts were the most common financial instrument used for <b>hedging</b> <b>transaction</b> exposures. Input risks also identified as an economic risk is one of the hardest to manage. This study has showed that effects from exchange rate fluctuations affect the moving average inventory value different than other inventory models. The input currencies need to be identified and separated from the sales currencies otherwise there is a potential risk to make wrong decisions...|$|E
