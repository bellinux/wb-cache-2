40|$|Injury {{criteria}} and risk curves {{are needed for}} anthropomorphic <b>test</b> devices (<b>dummies)</b> to assess injuries for improving human safety. The present state of knowledge is based on using injury outcomes and biomechanical metrics from post-mortem human subject (PMHS) and mechanical records from <b>dummy</b> <b>tests.</b> Data from these models are combined to develop dummy injury assessment risk curves/values (IARCs and IARVs). This simple substitution approach involves duplicating dummy metrics for PMHS tested under similar conditions and pairing with PMHS injury outcomes. It {{does not account for}} the age of each specimen tested in the PMHS group. Current substitution methods for injury risk assessments use age as a covariate and dummy metrics (e. g., accelerations) are not modified so that age can be directly included in the model. The age-infusion methodology presented in this perspective article accommodates for an annual rate factor that modifies the dummy injury risk assessment responses to account for the age of the PMHS that the injury data was based on. The annual rate factor is determined using human injury risk curves. The dummy metrics are modulated based on individual PMHS age and rate factor, thus infusing age into the dummy data. Using PMHS injuries and accelerations from side-impact experiments, matched-pair <b>dummy</b> <b>tests</b> and logistic regression techniques, the methodology demonstrates the process of age-infusion to derive the IARCs and IARVs...|$|R
40|$|During mass {{properties}} testing on the X- 48 B Blended Wing Body aircraft (The Boeing Company, Chicago, Illinois) at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, California, large inertia measurement errors {{were observed in}} results from compound pendulum swings when compared to analytical models. By comparing periods of oscillations as measured from an average over the test period versus the period of each oscillation, it was noticed that the frequency of oscillation was shifting significantly throughout the test. This phenomenon was only noticed during compound pendulum swings, and not during bifilar pendulum swings. The frequency shift was only visible upon extensive data analysis of the frequency for each oscillation, and did not appear in averaged frequency data over the test period. Multiple test articles, test techniques, and hardware setups were used in attempts to eliminate or identify {{the cause of the}} frequency shift. Plotting the frequency of oscillation revealed a region of minimal shift that corresponded to a larger amplitude range. This region of minimal shift provided the most accurate results compared to a known test article; however, the amplitudes that produce accurate inertia measurements are amplitudes larger than those generally accepted in {{mass properties}} testing. This paper examines two case studies of the frequency shift, using mass properties testing performed on a <b>dummy</b> <b>test</b> article, and on the X- 48 B Blended Wing Body aircraft...|$|E
40|$|Process capability, {{which is}} an {{important}} concept within statistical process control (SPC), describes {{the ability of a}} process i. e. a thermal process to produce components within the tolerance limits. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify possible methods for how to perform process capability study and temperature uniformity survey. In this essay the capability of the case hardening at continuous furnaces have been studied, considering a number of quality parameters. The outcome form these parameters described how well the process could produce components within the tolerances. The parameters of interest were case depth, core hardness, surface hardness, and surface carbon content. Practical work was done at Volvo Construction Equipment (VCE), Eskilstuna and Getrag All Wheel Drive AB, Köping. The parameters were measured from <b>dummy</b> <b>test</b> specimens in Getrag All Wheel Drive AB, and were analyzed by statistical software Minitab version 16. Temperature uniformity surveys (TUSs) were studied for both companies according to standard AMS 2750 D. However, it was not written in it how to make analysis of temperature data. In TUSs, a datapaq with ten thermocouples where used during production from which the temperature could be logged at different positions of the stacking trays and over the entire cross-section of the furnaces. The furnace temperature was within the specified tolerances; however, the significant differences within each track from each of the furnaces were recorded. One of the furnaces was constructed with two parallel tracks while the other was constructed with three parallel tracks. It’s related with the ratio of production capacity for the actual furnace, it will also give information of how the degree of production capacity is influenced by temperature uniformity. The author recommends that both companies perform the same test next year. It is also recommended that further research should be carried out by the methodology that was utilized in this essay...|$|E
40|$|Current thermosonic {{flip chip}} bonding {{technologies}} are adversely affected by chip-to-substrate co-planarity errors and bump/pad height variations {{which can lead to}} uneven bonding strength and, in extreme cases, chip cratering. This has limited the industrial uptake of thermosonic flip chip assembly. The aim of the research reported here was to explore the use of laser-generated ultrasound as an alternative ultrasound source in {{flip chip bonding}}. The research was motivated by the idea that, with greater control over the distribution of ultrasonic energy applied over the bonding interface, {{it should be possible to}} compensate for and mitigate the above effects. The main objective of this research work was to establish a working flip-chip bonding process using laser induced ultrasonic vibration. Initially, a literature review on current flip-chip bonding methods and laser ultrasonic methods was carried out. This suggested that confined laser ablation would be the most appropriate technique for generating strong ultrasonic vibration. Next, through modelling and simulation, an investigation was carried out to determine the suitable parameters and methods to be implemented during the experimental stage, including the pressure pulse amplitude, cavity width (irradiance spot size) and type of sacrificial material. Additional investigations were also carried out to explore the effect of applying different materials in generating ultrasonic vibration and also to show the effect of applying multiple pressure pulses simultaneously. In the experimental phase, a custom bonding rig was developed and used to explore the parameter space for thermosonic bonding on polymer substrates using ultrasound generated by a diode-pumped solid-state laser (355 nm wavelength). Initial experiments showed unstable bond strength due to the accumulation of heat which resulted in the appearance of an unwanted glue-like substance at the bonding interface. However, this issue was overcome through careful choice of process parameters combined with the introduction of off-axis laser irradiation. A process for bonding <b>dummy</b> <b>test</b> chips to flexible substrates was successfully established, and in the best case a die shear strength of 9. 3 gf/bump was achieved. Open Acces...|$|E

The data that researchers acquire from these <b>test</b> <b>dummies</b> are more useful if the <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> represents the population being studied. The goal {{of this study was}} to measure the validity of a 50 th percentile Hybrid II <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> (HTD) as an accurate representation of a wheelchair user. A test pilot with T 8 paraplegia due to traumatic spinal cord injury served as a basis for validation. Simple modifications were made to the HTD to approximate the trunk stability characteristics of a person with a spinal cord injury. An HTD, a modified HTD, and a human test pilot were seated in an electric-powered wheelchair and several braking tests performed. The standard HTD underestimated the kinematics when compared to the test pilot. The modified HTD had less trunk stability than the standard HTD during all braking methods. The modified HTD and wheelchair test pilot had similar trunk stability characteristics during kill switch and joystick full-reverse braking conditions. The modified HTD is a satisfactory representation of a wheelchair user with a spinal cord injury; however, the modified <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> underestimates the trunk dynamics during the less extreme joystick release braking. Work should continue on the development of a low-speed, low-impact <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> that emulates the wheelchair user population. © 2001 IPEM...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first results from `Violin-Mode' measurements {{made on the}} four suspension fibres of a fully suspended 40 kg test mass. These measurements were made at the LIGO lab, Gravitational Wave Observatory test facility, at MIT. Here, an aluminium-alloy (<b>dummy)</b> <b>test</b> mass, simulating an advanced LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) test mass/mirror, had been suspended in air from a test suspension by four fused-silica suspension fibres, each measuring 400 mu m in diameter x 600 mm long. Violin-Mode measurements were made on these highly tensioned fibres by retrofitting a prototype system of four novel shadow sensors to the test suspension, one per fibre, these sensors having, collectively, a displacement sensitivity of (6. 9 +/- 1. 3) x 10 (- 11) m (rms) Hz(- 1 / 2), at 500 Hz, over a measuring span of +/- 0. 1 mm. Violin-Mode fundamental resonances were detected in all four fibres: with frequencies similar to 485 Hz when the test mass was supported lightly from below, and at similar to 500 Hz when it was fully suspended. In the latter case the Violin-Mode detection took place whilst the test mass, together with its suspension fibres, was undergoing relatively large-amplitude `pendulum-mode' motion, at similar to 0. 6 Hz. This motion was measured to have a peak-peak amplitude {{at one of the}} suspension fibres of up to similar to 140 mu m (35 mu m, rms) -the shadow sensors each having subsidiary outputs for monitoring such low-frequency, large amplitude, motion. Under fully suspended conditions, a calibrated Violin-Mode `free-oscillation' amplitude of 430 +/- 20 picometres, rms, was measured at 500. 875 Hz, in the same suspension fibre which was found to be undergoing, simultaneously, the similar to 140 mu m peak-peak motion. Over the bandwidth monitored (dc to 3. 2 kHz), Violin-Mode harmonics up to the sixth were recorded in an evoked response. It was concluded that the prototype system had demonstrated amply its practical viability as a detector of Violin-Mode resonances in the test-mass suspension fibres of gravitational wave interferometers, such as those of advanced LIGO...|$|E
40|$|Last year 319 {{people were}} killed in traffic {{accidents}} in Sweden. The majority of these were car drivers and passengers. In order to minimize the number of people killed in traffic, vehicle safety is very important. Crash tests are frequently used to develop safety systems in cars. Both mechanical testing with crash dummies and simulations with mathematical models of the crash dummies are used. However, a disadvantage with the crash dummies is that they have limited biofidelity in order to be durable for repeatable testing. Therefore {{there is a difference between}} their kinematics in a collision compared to the kinematics of humans. To be able to predict the response of a human body, mathematical human body models have recently been developed, e. g. the Total HUman Model for Safety (THUMS). Since THUMS is a relatively new model there have been limited validation done to establish its kinematic performance. In pure frontal impact some validations have been done, by means of pendulum and sled tests, but in oblique frontal impacts, a rather common crash situation, no evaluation have been done. The aim of this project is to evaluate the kinematics of THUMS version 2. 21 against Post Mortem Human Subjects (PMHS) in oblique frontal collisions. Two sled test series with belted PMHS and Hybrid III 50 th percentile male (HIII) dummies have been used in the project. The velocities in the tests were approximately 30 km/h and the acceleration pulses in the sleds were approximately 13 g. The two sled setups have been modelled and simulated with an HIII dummy model and with THUMS. The HIII simulations were used to validate the sled environment and then THUMS was evaluated against the PMHS data. The results consist of belt force, acceleration and displacement comparisons between the mechanical test results and the mathematical model predictions. The results from the HIII simulations shows good conformity with the HIII <b>dummy</b> <b>test</b> results for both sled environments. In the THUMS evaluation there are issues with THUMS interaction with the simulated seat belt. The belt elements entangle with the elements in the neck and the chest of THUMS and the belt therefore get stuck. However, THUMS replicates post mortem human kinematics even though THUMS appears to be somewhat stiffer than the PMHS...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Whiplash Associated Disorders (WADs), or ‘whiplash injuries’, due to low {{severity}} vehicle crashes are {{of great}} concern in motorised countries and it is well established {{that the risk of}} such injuries is higher for females than for males, even in similar crash conditions. Recent protective systems {{have been shown to be}} more beneficial for males than for females. Hence there is a need for improved tools to address female WAD prevention when developing and evaluating the performance of whiplash protection systems. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a finite element model of a 50 th percentile female rear impact crash test dummy. Methods The anthropometry of the 50 th percentile female was specified based on literature data. The model, called EvaRID (Eva - female/RID - Rear Impact Dummy), was based on the same design concept as the existing 50 th percentile male rear impact dummy, the BioRID II. A scaling approach was developed and the first version, EvaRID V 1. 0, was implemented. Its dynamic response was compared to female volunteer data from rear impact sled tests. Results The EvaRID V 1. 0 model and the volunteer tests compared well until 250 ms of the head and T 1 forward accelerations and rearward linear displacements, and of the head rearward angular displacement. Markedly less T 1 rearward angular displacement was found for the EvaRID model compared to the female volunteers. Similar results were received for the BioRID II model when comparing simulated responses with experimental data under volunteer loading conditions. The results indicate that the biofidelity of the EvaRID V 1. 0 and BioRID II FE models have limitations, predominantly in the T 1 rearward angular displacement, at low velocity changes (7 km/h). The BioRID II model was validated against <b>dummy</b> <b>test</b> results in a loading range close to consumer test conditions (EuroNCAP) and lower severity levels of volunteer testing were not considered. Conclusions The EvaRID dummy model demonstrated the potential of becoming a valuable tool when evaluating and developing seats and whiplash protection systems. However, updates of the joint stiffness will be required to provide better correlation at lower load levels. Moreover, the seated posture, curvature of the spine and head position of 50 th percentile female occupants needs to be established and implemented in future models...|$|E
