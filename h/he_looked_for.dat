5|$|Suffering {{from what}} would today be {{described}} as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Murphy slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> solace in addictive sleeping pills. In his last few years, he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials {{because he did not}} want to set a bad example. Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971, which was shortly before his 46th birthday. He was interred with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. His grave is one of the most visited sites in the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of the telegraph {{and the development of}} the telephone gave McKinley a greater control over the day-to-day management of the war than previous presidents had enjoyed, and he used the new technologies to direct the army's and navy's movements {{as far as he was}} able. McKinley found Alger inadequate as Secretary of War, and did not get along with the Army's commanding general, Nelson A. Miles. Bypassing them, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> strategic advice first from Miles's predecessor, General John Schofield, and later from Adjutant General Henry Clarke Corbin. The war led to a change in McKinley's cabinet, as the President accepted Sherman's resignation as Secretary of State; Day agreed to serve as Secretary until the war's end.|$|E
5|$|The trailer piqued the {{interest}} of Twitch Film editor Todd Brown, who inquired if the project had entered production. When Matti {{told him that the}} film did not yet have a screenplay, Brown encouraged him to write it while <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> investors for financing. On the script's ninth revision, screenwriter Michiko Yamamotoknown for films such as Magnifico (2004) and Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros (2006)came on board to help finalize the remainder of the draft. Four uncredited consultants were also hired to develop details in the story.|$|E

5|$|Calvert took an {{interest}} in the British colonisation of the Americas, at first for commercial reasons and later to create a refuge for persecuted English Catholics. He became the proprietor of Avalon, the first sustained English settlement on the southeastern peninsula on the island of Newfoundland (off the eastern coast of modern Canada). Discouraged by its cold and sometimes inhospitable climate and the sufferings of the settlers, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> a more suitable spot further south and sought a new royal charter to settle the region, which would become the state of Maryland. Calvert died five weeks before the new Charter was sealed, leaving the settlement of the Maryland colony to his son Cecil (1605–1675). His second son Leonard Calvert (1606–1647) was the first colonial governor of the Province of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 Sir Kenneth Muir Mackenzie, who {{had served}} as Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, was close to retirement. The current Lord Chancellor Lord Haldane {{believed}} that the duties of a Lord Chancellor were too much for one man, and should be divided between a Lord Chancellor and a Minister of Justice. As such <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> a Permanent Secretary who was a qualified lawyer and who could help him set up a Ministry of Justice after the war, appointing Schuster in early 1915. The two did not work together, however, until Haldane became Lord Chancellor {{for a second time}} in 1924; he was forced to resign several months before Schuster started work on 2 July 1915 after being accused of pro-German sympathies.|$|E
5|$|Tim Downs scouted {{possible}} {{areas for}} location filming. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> a location that could {{stand in for}} three different venues without the production having to move or change hotels: the film's opening scene; the God planet's establishing shots; and the Nimbus III Paradise City. Downs {{was familiar with the}} Mojave desert and thought that locations near Ridgecrest, California, would serve the production's needs, so he took photos based on sketches Rodis had provided of what the locations might look like. Downs also shot photos with filters and tried to accomplish dust effects with his car to replicate ideas for how some sequences would be shot. When Downs returned with the photos, Shatner felt that the locations the scout found would be perfect for the film.|$|E

25|$|Siegel {{believed}} publishers kept rejecting {{them because}} he and Shuster were young and unknown, so <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> an established artist to replace Shuster. When Siegel told Shuster what he was doing, Shuster reacted by burning their rejected Superman comic, sparing only the cover.|$|E
25|$|Sergeant Joe DeLisio {{ran through}} the intense German gunfire and Lt. Karl H. Timmermann and the others {{followed}} him. Bratge tried to organize a counterattack to throw the Americans back across the bridge, but the American tanks' shell fire stopped him. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> Scheller and found he had already escaped out {{the far end of}} the tunnel.|$|E

25|$|In his biographic {{writings}} Arslan {{states that}} <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> an alternative destination, without elaborating on the reasons. By then, ambassador to France was Na‘ūm Pāšā, former mutaṣarrif of Mount Lebanon during Arslan's tenure as mudīr in 1893. Apparently Arslan {{did not have}} good relations with Na‘ūm; 17 years before, a conflict with him had caused his resignation as mudīr and his exile.|$|E
25|$|With his arm injured, Paige {{suddenly}} found himself unemployable. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> {{work as a}} manager or coach, but was unsuccessful. One ballclub owner {{was willing to give}} him a chance to play ball again—J.L. Wilkinson of the Monarchs. Wilkinson offered him the modest opportunity to play, not for the Negro American League Monarchs, but for a second-string barnstorming team called the Travelers, which was now renamed the Satchel Paige All-Stars. Paige would pitch when he could and play first base when he could not.|$|E
25|$|The {{films that}} he made next were overtly political, and earned him the {{reputation}} as a Marxist artist. This was also the time of large-scale political unrest throughout India. Particularly in and around Calcutta, this period underwent what {{is now known as}} the Naxalite movement. This phase was immediately followed by a series of films where he shifted his focus, and instead of looking for enemies outside, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> the enemy within his own middle class society. This was arguably his most creative phase.|$|E

25|$|Atkinson {{pursued a}} {{business}} career from 1882 onwards and in 1894 he was admitted {{as an attorney}} to the Bar of Pennsylvania. While he gained much material success in his profession as a lawyer, the stress and over-strain eventually took its toll, and during this time he experienced a complete physical and mental breakdown, and financial disaster. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> healing and in the late 1880s he found it with New Thought, later attributing the restoration of his health, mental vigor and material prosperity to {{the application of the}} principles of New Thought.|$|E
25|$|Contestants ages 12–15 {{were chosen}} each spring from five-minute {{audition}} tapes sent in {{by more than}} 12,000 teens to the show's production team. Twenty players were selected to participate {{in each of the}} first five seasons of Endurance; this was reduced to sixteen in Season 6. In a 2004 newspaper interview, Roth revealed that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> as diverse a group as possible. Shooting of the series took place each summer over a three-week period and began with the selected teenaged contestants arriving at a secret remote location in late July. Each season was taped in a different location, including California, Hawaii, Mexico, and Fiji.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Fortuné {{moved to}} FC Utrecht in the Dutch Eredivisie. Finding himself {{back in the}} winger role he enjoyed a {{successful}} time at the club but struggled {{after the death of}} his friend, neighbour and teammate David Di Tommaso. During his time at Utrecht, Fortuné scored a total of 13 goals in 56 league and cup appearances for Utrecht. During the January transfer window of the following season <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> a move back to France after an unsettling period in the Netherlands. He secured a move back before the transfer deadline and was signed by Coupe de la Ligue winners and Ligue 1 side Nancy.|$|E

25|$|Structuration theory allows {{researchers}} {{to focus on}} any structure or concept individually or in combination. In this way, structuration theory prioritizes ontology over epistemology. In his own work, Giddens focuses on production and reproduction of social practices in some context. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> stasis and change, agent expectations, relative degrees of routine, tradition, behavior, and creative, skillful, and strategic thought simultaneously. He examined spatial organization, intended and unintended consequences, skilled and knowledgeable agents, discursive and tacit knowledge, dialectic of control, actions with motivational content, and constraints. Structuration theorists conduct analytical research of social relations, rather than organically discovering them, since they use structuration theory to reveal specific research questions, though that technique has been criticized as cherry-picking.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish born German writer John Henry Mackay {{found out}} about Stirner while reading a copy of Friedrich Albert Lange's History of Materialism and Critique of its Present Importance. Later <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> a copy of The Ego and Its Own and after being fascinated with it he wrote a {{biography}} of Stirner (Max Stirner – sein Leben und sein Werk), published in German in 1898. Mackay's propaganda of stirnerist egoism and of male homosexual and bisexual rights affected Adolf Brand who published the world's first ongoing homosexual publication, Der Eigene in 1896. Another later German anarchist publication influenced deeply by Stirner was Der Einzige. It appeared in 1919, as a weekly, then sporadically until 1925 and was edited by cousins Anselm Ruest (pseud. for Ernst Samuel) and Mynona (pseud. for Salomo Friedlaender).|$|E
25|$|Mato Medović {{was born}} on 17 November 1857 in Kuna on the Pelješac {{peninsula}} into a peasant family. Young Mato got his first education at a nearby Franciscan monastery dedicated to Our Lady of Loreto (Delorita). In 1868, {{at the age of}} 11 he joined the Franciscan seminary in Dubrovnik, where he took his vows in 1874, taking the name of Celestin. The artistic talent of the young monk was noticed by Abbot Portoguaro Bernardino, on a visit from Rome. So in 1880, Medović was placed in the monastery of St Isidoro in Rome, known for its Nazarene painters. He was assigned to Lodovico Seitz, an influential artist who painted the frescoes in the Cathedral of Đakovo. However, the rigid and outdated artistic style did not suit Medović, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> a different teacher in Giuseppe Grandi, then in the private school of Antonio Ciseri in Florence.|$|E
