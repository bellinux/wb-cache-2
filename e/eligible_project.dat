40|$|This report {{describes}} Pacific Northwest Laboratory`s (PNL`s) {{evaluation of}} the impact of an energy conservation project completed in the fall of 1992. The project (a mill tailings thickener) was installed at J. R. Simplot Company`s (Simplot`s) Smoky Canyon Mine in Caribou County, Idaho near Afton, Wyoming. The project at Simplot is one in a continuing series of industrial energy conservation projects to have its impact evaluated by PNL. All of the projects have received or will receive acquisition payments from the Bonneville Power Administration (Bonneville) under the Energy $avings Plan (E$P) Program. The E$P is being offered to reduce electricity consumption in the industrial sector of Bonneville`s service territory.

40|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised among the {{scientific}} communities about the increased atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2). Carbon sequestration rates can be maintained or increased by afforestation, reforestation, avoided deforestation, forest preservation and particular tending and cultural operations on existing forests. Of these, afforestation and reforestation are the only <b>eligible</b> <b>project</b> activities under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Of the three market-based mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol (KP), CDM {{is the only one}} designed for developing countries where, coincidently, community based forest management systems (CBFMS) are becoming the main form of forest management. Under these systems, enhanced natural regeneration, forest preservation and wise utilization through different sets of cultural and tending operations are widely practiced in Africa, Asia and Latin America. These systems are often more compatible with the essence of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) than are alternative management systems. Using Nepal as a case study, this paper highlights the importance of community forests in developing countries and then explains why many of them may not be eligible for CDM project activities. After that, some reasons why enhanced natural regeneration and fores...|$|E

40|$|There are {{two areas}} where borrowers’ counsel can easily misstep when {{representing}} a charitable organization in a tax-exempt bond deal. The first is failing {{to recognize that}} “private business use” under § 145 can (and does) result in situations that would not constitute an “unrelated trade or business” of the borrower. The second occurs when borrowers’ counsel conflate the test for “unrelated business taxable income” under § 512 {{with the use of}} “unrelated trades or businesses” in the definition of a qualified 501 (c) (3) bond under § 145. A mistake in either of these areas could lead to an erroneous opinion that the use of bond proceeds will not result in taxation of interest on the bonds. This article will explain these distinctions and include helpful examples. In addition, there are two areas where charitable organizations often take actions that subsequently preclude the use of tax-exempt bonds for an otherwise <b>eligible</b> <b>project.</b> The first of these involves the reimbursement of project expenses with bond proceeds advanced from the charity’s available funds. Borrowers’ counsel may not be aware of rules that require certain actions contemporaneous with the advances if the advanced funds ultimately will be reimbursed with the proceeds of tax-exempt debt. Similarly, charitable organizations may inadvertently use donation solicitation materials that foreclose the future use of tax-exempt bond financing for a specific project. Although borrowers’ counsel may be asked to review these materials before they are sent to potential donors, these counsel may not be sensitive to the application of the tax-exempt financing rules that govern the use of bonds to finance projects which are the subject of a capital campaign or other donation. This article will discuss the Treasury Regulations promulgated under § 148, defining arbitrage bonds and governing the creation of replacement proceeds, and their applicability to the reimbursement of advances and solicitation of donations...|$|E
