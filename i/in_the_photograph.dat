5|$|About a {{week before}} the wedding of couple Grace and Keir Johnston of Colonsay, Scotland, the bride's mother, Cecilia Bleasdale, took a {{photograph}} of a dress she planned to wear to the wedding and sent it to her daughter. After disagreements over the perceived colour of the dress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> the bride posted the image on Facebook, and her friends also disagreed over the colour; some saw it as white with gold lace, while others saw it as blue with black lace. For a week, the debate became well known in Colonsay, a small island community.|$|E

5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (as {{exemplified}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> The Falling Man), landing {{on the streets and}} rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below. Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access doors were locked. No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E
5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) convinces Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) not {{to include}} a {{photograph}} of the glee club in the school yearbook, as in previous years, glee club photographs have been heavily defaced in the library copy of the yearbook by fellow students. Club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) personally buys a meager section of advertising space in the book so that a photograph featuring at least two members can be included. Fearing unpopularity, the club nominates Rachel (Lea Michele) to represent them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b> Rachel convinces Finn (Cory Monteith) to appear alongside her, but after being teased by his peers, he drops out. When it transpires that the school photographer (John Ross Bowie) is soon to direct a commercial for his brother-in-law, a local mattress store owner, Rachel convinces him to cast the glee club in it, believing that local celebrity status will prevent the other students from mocking them.|$|E
5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E

5|$|The retrial {{was delayed}} {{for one day}} to give the {{defendants}} more time to prepare. The new jury selection was marked by attempts by Williams to be relieved of her duties, owing to disagreements with Shakur {{as well as with}} Hilton's attorney. Judge Arnold Bauman denied the application, but directed another lawyer, Howard Jacobs, to defend Shakur while Williams remained the attorney of record. Shakur was ejected following an argument with Williams, and Hilton left with her as jury selection continued. After the selection of twelve jurors (60 were excused), Williams was allowed to retire from the case, with Shakur officially representing herself, assisted by lawyer Florynce Kennedy. In the retrial, White testified that the six alleged robbers had saved their hair clippings to create disguises, and identified a partially obscured head and shoulder in a photo taken from a surveillance camera as Shakur's. Kennedy objected to this identification {{on the grounds that the}} prosecutor, assistant United States attorney Peter Truebner, had offered to stipulate that Shakur was not depicted in any of the photographs. Although both White and Rivers testified that Shakur was wearing overalls during the robbery, the person identified as Shakur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> was wearing a jacket. The defense attempted to discredit White on the grounds that he had spent eight months in Matteawan Hospital for the Criminally Insane in 1968, and White countered that he had faked insanity (by claiming to be Allah in front of three psychiatrists) to get transferred out of prison.|$|E

Ira Hayes, together with Navy corpsman John Bradley, became celebrities upon their participation in a war bond selling tour after the battle. Two subsequent Marine Corps investigations into {{the identities of the}} six men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> determined in 1946 and 1947 that Henry Hansen was misidentified as being Block (both Marines died 6 days after the photo), and in May and June 2016 that Bradley was not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> and Pfc.

50|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the bulky {{equipment}} and lighting issues, wedding photography was largely a studio practice for most of the late 19th century. Over time, technology improved, but many couples still might only pose for a single wedding portrait. Wedding albums started becoming more commonplace towards the 1880s, and the photographer would sometimes include <b>the</b> wedding party <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs.</b> Often <b>the</b> wedding gifts would be laid out and recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> as well.|$|R
