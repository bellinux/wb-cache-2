5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and {{his company}} had been {{considered}} {{a continuation of the}} cinema of attractions. The first few years of the 20th century were a period in which many film-makers began placing a higher emphasis on portraying a narrative story, and lesser so more on the image and the ability to show something. The film is considered a step forward in both film grammar and structure.

5|$|Adams {{is home to}} {{a fairly}} wide variety of animal species. Several hoofed mammals call the {{mountain}} home: mountain goats, Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, and mule deer. Large carnivores include cougar, black bear, coyote, bobcat, and the Cascade mountain fox, an endemic subspecies of the red fox. There have also been sightings of wolverine and unconfirmed reports of wolves. Many small mammals also make Adams their home. Squirrels and chipmunks are numerous throughout the forest. Douglas squirrels, least chipmunks, and Townsend's chipmunks live throughout the forest with golden-mantled ground squirrels and California ground squirrels occupying drier areas as well. These squirrels are preyed upon by the elusive and secretive pine martens that also call Adams their home. <b>Hoary</b> marmots and pikas make their home on open rocky areas at any altitude while the elusive snowshoe hare lives throughout the forest.|$|E

25|$|In the {{richness}} of this region many animal species pass through this zone at least one season a year such as mountain goat, black-tailed deer, American black bear, elk, cougar, and many bird species.

Besides {{the richness}} of mammals there is a richness of insects that are integral to the abundance of flowering plant species in this area.

25|$|Wind {{pollination}} is {{the reproductive}} strategy {{adopted by the}} grasses, sedges, rushes and catkin-bearing plants. Other flowering plants are mostly pollinated by insects (or birds or bats), {{which seems to be}} the primitive state, and some plants have secondarily developed wind pollination.

The <b>hoary</b> plantain is primarily wind pollinated, but is also visited by insects which pollinate it. In general, showy, colourful, fragrant flowers like sunflowers, orchids and Buddleja are insect pollinated. The only entomophilous plants that are not seed plants are the dung-mosses of the family Splachnaceae.|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} that among angiosperms, {{entomophily}} is the primitive state; this is indicated by the vestigial nectaries in the wind-pollinated Urtica and other plants, {{and the presence of}} fragrances in some of these plants.

However a number of plants in multiple families have secondarily adopted wind pollination in contrast to other members of their groups. Some plants are intermediate between the two pollination methods. common heather is regularly pollinated by insects, but produce clouds of pollen and some wind pollination is inevitable, and the <b>hoary</b> plantain is primarily wind pollinated, but is also visited by insects which pollinate it.|$|E
