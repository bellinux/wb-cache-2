40|$|The {{fact that}} it takes time for the brain to process {{information}} from the changing environment underlies many experimental phenomena of awareness of spatiotemporal events, including a number of astonishing illusions. These phenomena have been explained from the predictive and postdictive theoretical perspectives. Here I describe the most extensively studied phenomena {{in order to see}} how well the two perspectives can explain them. Next, the neurobiological perceptual retouch mechanism of producing stimulation awareness is characterized and its work <b>in</b> <b>causing</b> the <b>listed</b> illusions is described. A perspective on how brain mechanisms of conscious perception produce the phenomena supportive of the postdictive view is presented in this article. At the same time, some of the phenomena cannot be explained by the traditional postdictive account, but can be interpreted from the perceptual retouch theory perspective...|$|R
50|$|The {{outbreak}} of the war convinced Western leaders of the growing threat of international communism. The United States began to encourage Western European countries, including West Germany, to contribute to their own defense, though this was perceived as a threat by its neighbors, especially France. West Germany had not fought in the Korean war, {{as it had been}} demilitarized. As the war continued, however, opposition to rearmament lessened and China’s <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> the war <b>caused</b> France to revise its position towards German rearmament. To contain the situation French officials proposed the creation of the European Defence Community (EDC), a supranational organisation, under the leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).|$|R

The authors used information on residency and death as gathered from municipal offices and, additionally, by record-linkage with the Swiss cause of death statistics. Slightly more than 80 % of the cases were identified unequivocally as of January 1996. Among them, 21 % of the cases died during the ten-year period; 70 % of them have an MS <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> the <b>cause</b> of death statistics, mostly as {{the main cause of}} death.

Failed anchor rods made of AIS 309 SS were analyzed for chemical composition, hardness, tensile strength and microstructural condition.

Overheating from flue gas <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> the gaps <b>caused</b> by inadequate expansion joints resulted in damage to the backup insulation layers. At such high temperatures, the SS anchor-MS weld will have a lesser strength and weld failure occurred. Loss of anchor reinforcement resulted in falling of refractories...|$|R

These banks were commercial not investment banks: they made short term loans and could not take land as collateral.

Counties getting a bank increased production per person substantially and tilted production towards agriculture over manufacturing by expanding land under cultivation, not improving yields.

Access to the traditional livelihood of harvesting marine resources has profound implications for the sustainability of the economy of Alaska's rural Native villages.

Although the alternatives may have had similar or worse effects on the village, limited entry is perceived as a major cause of economic and social dysfunction.

After being imprisoned in a primate sanctuary, Caesar uses his ingenuity {{to launch an}} uprising. The screenplay contains numerous complex connections to other <b>entries</b> <b>in</b> the series, <b>causing</b> some confusion as to its exact relation to them. Oliver Lindler writes that while the film's premise might identify it as a remake of Conquest, official dispatches and professional reviewers typically avoided the term, instead calling the film a prequel or [...] "origin story" [...] to the original Planet of the Apes film, and/or a reboot of the series, although fans and bloggers were more apt to make the [...] "remake" [...] connection. The completed script attracted director Rupert Wyatt. To portray ape characters realistically, the production avoided practical effects and animal actors in favor of performance capture acting, partnering with New Zealand visual effects company Weta Digital. Wyatt cast James Franco as Will Rodman, while veteran performance capture actor Andy Serkis signed on to star as Caesar.|$|R

40|$|In 2004, China {{attempted}} to set its national standard for mobile security (wireless LAN authentication and privacy infrastructure (WAPI)) {{which was to}} be used for wireless LAN. In 2005, Korea implemented a national standard for the mobile Internet platform (wireless Internet platform for interoperability (WIPI)). This paper examines and compares the two cases in terms of the role of government, characteristics of each standard and the process of standards setting. Despite some similarities of 'aiming for a de jure national standard', 'government-initiated' and 'anticipatory', the outcomes of the two efforts are different. WIPI was ratified in Korea, while WAPI was indefinitely postponed as the national standard and failed to be ratified as an international standard. It is contended here that the different outcomes are attributed to differences in the openness of the standards and of institutional processes of standardization, combined with the government role and the timing of market <b>entry.</b> <b>In</b> the <b>cause</b> of national security, China adhered to the original goal of WAPI; in the WIPI case, compromises were made to satisfy to some extent the various demands from many stakeholders despite the original goal being undermined. The findings from this comparison reinforce findings by previous studies on open standard and open standardization processes. This paper makes a unique contribution in that it first examines the international standards-setting attempts by newcomers, China and Korea, in the race for international standards. They used to be standard adopters but now want to become standard setters. Given the narrowing gap of technological capabilities at the global level and the huge size of markets in countries like China, these standards challenges from newcomers are not one-off episodes, but will happen repeatedly in the future. Further research is required in this area. WAPI WIPI International standards China Korea Standards war...|$|R
