Despite regime shifts during the 1980 s and full liberalization of the Polish economy in the beginning of 1990, cointegration relationships are found between broad real money holdings, real household income, an interest rate on an alternative asset, the inflation rate and shortage of goods. Because Poland knew severe policy shocks and monetary data show a development from a cash to a savings economy, extensive attention is paid to parameter constancy and stability of the cointegration relationships. Tests generally confirm stability of long-run income and <b>interest</b> <b>elasticities.</b> Short-run money demand estimates illustrate expectations of increased income and <b>interest</b> <b>elasticities,</b> as well as an increasingly active adjustment behavior.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{stability}} of long-run log-linear demand functions for narrowly defined monetary aggregates (M 1, Monetary Base) in the U.

The hypotheses that the individual time series which appear in such equations (real M 1, real Monetary Base, real Personal Income and short-term and long-term nominal interest rates) all have unit roots cannot be rejected. The primary conclusion {{of this study is}} that with proper attention to the time series properties of the available data, there exists strong evidence in support of a stable equilibrium demand function for real balances in the post-World War II U. S. economy. The hypothesis of a unitary equilibrium real income elasticity (a velocity function) cannot be rejected. Further, the estimates of equilibrium <b>interest</b> <b>elasticities</b> are approximately -. 5 to -. 6 for real M 1 and -. 4 to -. 5 for real monetary base. The estimated <b>interest</b> <b>elasticities</b> are significantly different statistically depending on whether long- term or short-term interest rates are used, but the observed differences in these estimates are not of economic significance. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{liberalization}} {{of interest rates}} has {{become more and more}} an integrated part of the policy advice given to developing countries in order to stimulate domestic savings and to improve the allocative efficiency of investments. One of the most critical assumptions behind this policy approach refers to a high and positive <b>interest</b> rate <b>elasticity</b> of savings. Empirically, this assumption seems not to be supported unanimously. Giovannini (1983), for instance, concludes from his survey of a sample of econometric studies that the notion of a positive impact of higher interest rates on national savings is not warranted empirically. This would lead {{to the conclusion that the}} expected success from interest liberalization policies would be questionable. However, such a judgement is not justified because the mentioned survey has various shortcomings. First, the range of empirical studies covered in the overview is rather limited. Second, the discussion of the <b>interest</b> rate <b>elasticity</b> of savings is not differentiated enough with respect to different savings aggregates. Third, some of the specification and methodological problems existing in estimating <b>interest</b> <b>elasticities</b> of savings are not tackled sufficiently. ...|$|R

This thesis {{explains the}} difference between the long run and short run income and <b>interest</b> <b>elasticities</b> of money demand by the presence of a fixed input into the creation of transactions in a cash-in advance model of money demand. This structure implies a time element for the response of money demand to changes in income and interest. The implication of the fixed input into the consumer’s transactions technology causes the income elasticity of money demand to be more elastic in short run whereas the <b>interest</b> rate <b>elasticity</b> to be more elastic in the long run. Besides, the presence of a fixed input provides a micro foundation for price stickiness and a time dynamic welfare cost of inflation. Empirical evidence from the US over 1959 : 1 – 2006 : 4 period verifies the predictions of our theoretical model on elasticities. To demonstrate that the theoretical model explains observed price stickiness, we use the empirical model to derive a version of the P-Star model of sticky prices. The estimated parameters point out the higher relative productivity of fixed input than of variable input, and a considerably high welfare cost of inflation. Başdaş, ÜlkemM. S...|$|R
