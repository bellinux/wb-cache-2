40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} how {{the characteristics of}} feedback receiver, <b>feedback</b> deliverer <b>and</b> <b>feedback</b> information influence psychological feedback reactions of the feedback receiver while largely neglecting that feedback intervention {{is a kind of}} social interaction process. To address this issue, this study proposes that employees’ perceived insider status (PIS), as a kind of employee-organization relationship, could also influence employees’ reactions to supervisory feedback. In particular, this study investigates the influence of PIS focusing on affective <b>and</b> cognitive <b>feedback</b> reactions, namely <b>feedback</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>feedback</b> utility. Surveys were conducted in a machinery manufacturing company in the Guangdong province of China. Samples were collected from 192 employees. Data analysis demonstrated that PIS <b>and</b> <b>feedback</b> utility possessed a U-shaped relationship, whereas PIS <b>and</b> <b>feedback</b> satisfaction exhibited positively linear relationships. The analysis identified two kinds of mediating mechanisms related to <b>feedback</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>feedback</b> utility. Internal feedback motivation attribution partially mediated the relationship between PIS <b>and</b> <b>feedback</b> satisfaction but failed to do the same with respect to the relationship between PIS <b>and</b> <b>feedback</b> utility. In contrast, external feedback motivation attribution partially mediated the relationship between PIS <b>and</b> <b>feedback</b> utility while failing to mediate the relationship between PIS <b>and</b> <b>feedback</b> satisfaction.

5|$|Jane Austen lived {{her entire}} life {{as part of a}} large and close-knit family on the lower fringes of the English gentry. Her family's steadfast support was {{critical}} to Austen's development as a professional writer. Austen read draft versions of all of her novels to her family, receiving <b>feedback</b> <b>and</b> encouragement, and it was her father who sent out her first publication bid. Austen's artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about thirty-five. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried and then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. With the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{argues that}} trust and {{reputation}} models should {{take into account}} not only direct experiences (local trust) and experiences from the circle of ”friends”, but also be attack resilient by design {{in the presence of}} dishonest <b>feedbacks</b> <b>and</b> sparse network connectivity. We first revisit EigenTrust, {{one of the most popular}} reputation systems to date, and identify the inherent vulnerabilities of EigenTrust in terms of its local trust vector, its global aggregation of local trust values, and its eigenvector based reputation propagating model. Then we present EigenTrust ++, an attack resilient trust management scheme. EigenTrust ++ extends the eigenvector based reputation propagating model, the core of EigenTrust, and counters each of vulnerabilities identified with alternative methods that are by design more resilient to dishonest <b>feedbacks</b> <b>and</b> sparse network connectivity under four known attack models. We conduct extensive experimental evaluation on EigenTrust ++, and show that EigenTrust ++ can significantly outperform EigenTrust in terms of both performance and attack resilience in the presence of dishonest <b>feedbacks</b> <b>and</b> sparse network connectivity against four representative attack models.

5|$|Other {{institutions}} were also formed {{with the purpose}} of providing <b>feedback</b> <b>and</b> monitoring activities on the ground. To enhance the protection of its crown colony further from internal skirmishes and attacks, in August 1915, the legislative council passed the Reserve Force and Civil Guard Ordinance. This was the first Act passed in a British colony which imposed compulsory military service on all male subjects between the ages 15 to 55 who were not in the armed forces, volunteers, or police. Additionally, a Reserve force in the Volunteer Corps was created for fit men over the age 40. From the slew of new initiatives enforced, {{it was clear that the}} British had taken the debacle of the mutiny as a serious lesson to learn from and to prevent from happening again.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid {{feedforward}} <b>and</b> <b>feedback</b> {{structures are}} useful for active noise control (ANC) applications where the noise can only be partially obtained with reference sensors. The traditional method uses the secondary signals of both the feedforward <b>and</b> <b>feedback</b> structures to synthesize a reference signal for the feedback structure in the hybrid structure. However, this approach introduces coupling between the feedforward <b>and</b> <b>feedback</b> structures <b>and</b> parameter changes in one structure affect the other during adaptation such that the feedforward <b>and</b> <b>feedback</b> structures must be optimized simultaneously in practical ANC system design. Two methods are investigated in this paper to remove such coupling effects. One is a simplified method, which uses the error signal directly as the reference signal in the <b>feedback</b> structure, <b>and</b> the second method generates the reference signal for the feedback structure by using only the secondary signal from the <b>feedback</b> structure <b>and</b> utilizes the generated reference signal as the error signal of the feedforward structure. Because the two decoupling methods can optimize the feedforward <b>and</b> <b>feedback</b> structures separately, they provide more flexibility {{in the design and}} optimization of the adaptive filters in practical ANC applications...|$|R
5|$|Rocks have a {{porphyritic}} texture. Basaltic andesites typically contain {{less than}} 10% crystals while dacites generally {{have more than}} 20% crystals. The Alconcha group lavas of the first one million years are crystal-poor and lack biotite; later lavas contain biotite and more crystals. Based on geothermometric data, the highest temperatures occurred during phases of high activity and lower temperatures are associated with low output periods. It is likely that crustal <b>feedback</b> <b>and</b> increased deep crustal influx of mantle-derived basalts drive increased magmatic flux. During {{the time of the}} Polan eruption on the west flank, magma output was spatially segregated with the peripheral Miño Volcano generating andesite lavas and the more central volcanos generating dacites.|$|E

5|$|While {{some forms}} of birth control do not affect the menstrual cycle, {{hormonal}} contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative <b>feedback</b> <b>and</b> the lack of estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development {{and the absence of}} a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E

5|$|Drew Karpyshyn, who {{previously}} {{served as a}} senior writer for Knights of the Old Republic, was the lead writer for Mass Effect. Despite of the fact that each of the game's planets had one primary writer, all of the writers involved in the production had to review each other's work and offer criticism. This process of collaborative <b>feedback</b> <b>and</b> individual effort is common at BioWare, and it behoved Karpyshyn to make sure the style was consistent across all different areas. One of the biggest challenges the writers faced was the amount of volume they were required to write to support the game's multiple dialogue paths and story outcomes. It took them three years to get everything into the game, which featured about 400,000 words and more than 20,000 lines of spoken dialogue. According to Karpyshyn, this is roughly the equivalent of 20 movies or 4-5 full novels.|$|E
5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} were reworked for this sequel. Some changes were made due to user <b>feedback</b> <b>and</b> others {{were meant to be}} included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints. The camera was switched to the right analog stick of the DualShock controller instead of the shoulder buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked. The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that. Other changes included more integration between exploration and battles. The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more choices in battles. The inclusion of worlds based on live-action Disney films was aided by technology that generated the character models from live-action pictures.|$|E
