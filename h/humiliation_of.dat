5|$|Chan Gailey came to Georgia Tech in 2002 after head {{coaching}} stints with the Dallas Cowboys, Samford Bulldogs, and Troy Trojans. Gailey's first team in 2002 managed to win seven games under the quarterbacking of A.J. Suggs. The most notable {{game of the}} 2002 season was an upset of National Title Contender North Carolina State. Georgia Tech rallied {{in the fourth quarter}} to upset NC State and end Philip Rivers's Heisman Trophy hopes. In 2003, eleven Georgia Tech players were found academically ineligible. Despite the academic losses and the playing of true freshman Reggie Ball, Gailey would lead Tech to a seven-win season and <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> Tulsa in the Humanitarian Bowl. P.J. Daniels racked up over 300 yards rushing in the effort.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{integration}} of southern Vietnam into the central administration, newly appointed imperial officials arrived in Saigon. The new mandarins carried out a detailed inquiry into Duyệt's rule and claimed that widespread corruption and abuse of power took place. Bạch Xuân Nguyên, {{the head of the}} inquiry, called for Duyet's posthumous prosecution, which resulted in 100 lashes being applied to his grave. Many of Duyệt's subordinates were arrested and 16 of his family members were executed. This action prompted the Duyệt's officials—fearful of their positions and security under the central system—to launch a revolt under the leadership of his adopted son Lê Văn Khôi. Historical opinion is divided with scholars contesting whether the <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> Duyệt or the loss of southern autonomy was the main catalyst.|$|E

5|$|Kitsune {{are often}} {{presented}} as tricksters, with motives that vary from mischief to malevolence. Stories tell of kitsune playing tricks on overly proud samurai, greedy merchants, and boastful commoners, while the crueler ones abuse poor tradesmen and farmers or devout Buddhist monks. Their victims are usually men; women are possessed instead. For example, kitsune {{are thought to}} employ their kitsunebi to lead travelers astray {{in the manner of}} a will o' the wisp. Another tactic is for the kitsune to confuse its target with illusions or visions. Other common goals of trickster kitsune include seduction, theft of food, <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> the prideful, or vengeance for a perceived slight.|$|E
5|$|President Sadat {{believed}} that Egypt's economic, political, social and military problems were {{a result of}} the Six Day War. He believed the solution to these problems lay with erasing the <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> the 1967 defeat, which required regaining the Sinai. In 1971 Sadat began the coordinated political and military groundwork to achieve this. In February, he proposed a phased Israel withdrawal from the Sinai, which would involve a reopening of the Suez Canal, and Israeli fulfillment of the UNSCR 242, including resolving the Palestinian refugee problem. In return Egypt would sign a peace treaty with Israel and reestablish relations with the United States. However Israeli insistence on retention of territory necessary for its security ended diplomatic efforts.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of the <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> Casey, {{the deaths of the}} topmen, and the severe punishment {{of the rest of the}} sailors appears to have driven the crew to mutiny. These factors, however, were arguably the final events in a series of harsh and brutal punishments by the captain. Dudley Pope, in his book The Black Ship, argues that it was not Pigot's cruelty that drove the men to mutiny but the general injustice that he showed in his favouritism to some and overly harsh punishment of others. Had Pigot remained more even-handed in his leadership, the mutiny might have been avoided.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the wealth}} of {{theoretical}} claims about the emotion <b>of</b> <b>humiliation</b> {{and its effect on}} human relations, there has been a lack of empirical research investigating what it means to experience humiliation. We studied the affective characteristics <b>of</b> <b>humiliation,</b> comparing the emotional experience <b>of</b> intergroup <b>humiliation</b> to two other emotions humiliation is often confused with: anger and shame. The defining characteristics <b>of</b> <b>humiliation</b> were low levels of guilt and high levels of other-directed outrage (like anger and unlike shame), and high levels of powerlessness (like shame and unlike anger). Reasons for the similarities and differences <b>of</b> <b>humiliation</b> with anger and shame are discussed in terms of perceptions of undeserved treatment and injustice.

5|$|Understanding {{that they}} could not hold out against the might of the British Empire indefinitely, Kruger hoped for a {{solution}} at the earliest opportunity. The triumvirate wrote to Colley on 12 February that they were prepared to submit to a royal commission. Colley liaised by telegraph with Gladstone's Colonial Secretary Lord Kimberley, then wrote to Kruger on 21 February that if the Boers stopped fighting he would cease hostilities and send commissioners for talks. Kruger received this letter on 28 February and readily accepted, but by now it was too late. Colley had been killed at the Battle of Majuba Hill the day before, another decisive victory for the Boers under Smit. This progressive <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> the Imperial forces in South Africa by a ragtag collection of farmers, to paraphrase Meintjes and the historian Ian Castle, stunned the Western world.|$|E
5|$|A popular lakon named Irawan Rabi ("Irawan's wedding") {{tells about}} {{the love of}} Irawan and Titisari, a {{daughter}} of Kresna (Krishna). While Titisari is engaged to Irawan, Baladewa (Baladeva), Kresna's brother and an ally of the Kurawas (Kauravas), wants her to marry Lesmana Mandrakumara, the son of Durjudana (Duryodhana), initiating a dramatic conflict. The conflict that ensues ends up being three-sided, among the Pandawas, Kurawas and the ogre-kingdom, whose evil ogre-king Barandjana plans to kidnap Titisari. The confusion that follows results in the outwitting and <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> the Kurawas. Siti Sendari, the eldest daughter of Kresna and the estranged wife of Abhimanju, {{takes advantage of the}} situation and schemes to bring Irawan and Titisari together, while also mending her relationships with her husband. Though officially Irawan and Titisari are the hero and heroine of the lakon, in reality they are mere spectators, not the movers, in the play. Brandon describes Irawan as a minor character. Irawan is also depicted as unassertive and manipulated by others, which is common in South Asian theatre. Another lakon called Serat Lampahan Pregiwa Pregiwati also relates a tale about the love of Irawan and Titisari.|$|E
5|$|Following the Empire-wide seizure and {{imprisonment}} of all Venetians in March 1171, the Byzantine fleet {{was strong}} enough to deter an outright attack by the Venetians, who sailed to Chios and settled for negotiations. Manuel sent a fleet of 150 ships under Kontostephanos to confront them there and employed delaying tactics, until, weakened by disease, the Venetians began to withdraw and were pursued by Kontostephanos' fleet. It was a remarkable reversal of fortunes, compared with the <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> 1125. In 1177, another fleet of 70 galleys and 80 auxiliary ships under Kontostephanos, destined for Egypt, returned home after appearing off Acre, as Count Philip of Flanders and many important nobles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem refused to participate in the campaign. However, by the end of Manuel's reign, the strains of constant warfare on all fronts and the Emperor's various grandiose projects had become evident: the historian Niketas Choniates attributes the rise of piracy in the latter years of Manuel's reign to the diversion of the funds intended for the maintenance of the fleet for other needs of the imperial treasury.|$|E

5|$|Gaveston was not exiled immediately; he did {{not have}} to leave the realm until 25 June, but faced excommunication by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Winchelsey, should he return. Edward used the {{intervening}} period to provide for his favourite's continued prosperity and political importance. As a compensation for the loss of the earldom of Cornwall, which was another condition of the exile, Gaveston was granted land worth 3,000 marks annually in Gascony, and land amounting to the same value in England. Further to this, he was appointed the King's Lieutenant of Ireland, so that a certain amount of honour could be maintained despite the <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> the exile. The appointment came the day after Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, had been given the same position, indicating that it was an improvised measure. Gaveston's appointment came with wider authority than Ulster's, however, for he had full regal powers to appoint and dismiss any royal officers.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's only {{significant}} military defeat {{occurred during the}} Siege of Petersburg. His II Corps moved south of the city, along the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, tearing up track. On August 25, Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth attacked and overran the faulty Union position at Reams's Station, shattering the II Corps, capturing many prisoners. Despite a later victory at Hatcher's Run, the <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> Reams's Station contributed, along with the lingering effects of his Gettysburg wound, to his decision to give up field command in November. He left the II Corps after {{a year in which}} it had suffered over 40,000 casualties, but had achieved significant military victories. His next assignment was to command the ceremonial First Veteran Corps. He performed more recruiting, commanded the Middle Department, and relieved Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan in command of forces in the now-quiet Shenandoah Valley. He was promoted to brevet major general in the regular army for his service at Spotsylvania, effective March 13, 1865.|$|E
5|$|In August 1805, the French Grande Armée {{invaded the}} German states {{in hopes of}} {{knocking}} Austria {{out of the war}} before Russian forces could intervene. On 25 September, after great secrecy and feverish marching, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of 160 miles (260km). Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Bavaria. Napoleon hoped to swing his forces northward and perform a wheeling movement that would find the French at the Austrian rear. The Ulm Maneuver was well executed, and on 20 October Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered at Ulm, bringing the total number of Austrian prisoners in the campaign to 60,000. The French captured Vienna in November and went on to inflict a decisive defeat on a Russo-Austrian army at Austerlitz in early December. Austerlitz led to the expulsion of Russian troops from Central Europe and the <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> Austria, which signed the Treaty of Pressburg on 26 December.|$|E

Although Kartik had scored 45 and 27 in his two innings, he totalled only three Duleep Trophy wickets {{at an average of}} 131.33. The selectors were unsatisfied by these performances, and despite a shoulder injury to Kumble, Kartik was discarded as India hosted Australia in the 2001 Border Gavaskar Trophy. Harbhajan was recalled and took 32 wickets at 17 to engineer an Indian series win and permanently establish himself as India's leading spinner alongside Kumble.

5|$|The Maya {{political}} landscape was highly complex and Maya elites engaged in political intrigue to gain {{economic and social}} advantage over neighbours. In the Late Classic, some cities established {{a long period of}} dominance over other large cities, such as the dominance of Caracol over Naranjo for half a century. In other cases, loose alliance networks were formed around a dominant city. Border settlements, usually located about halfway between neighbouring capitals, often switched allegiance over the course of their history, and at times acted independently. Dominant capitals exacted tribute in the form of luxury items from subjugated population centres. Political power was reinforced by military power, and the capture and <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> enemy warriors played an important part in elite culture. An overriding sense of pride and honour among the warrior aristocracy could lead to extended feuds and vendettas, which caused political instability and the fragmentation of polities.|$|E
5|$|The empire was {{its peak}} {{again during the}} rule of the illustrious VikramadityaII (733–744) who is known not only for his {{repeated}} invasions of the territory of Tondaimandalam and his subsequent victories over Pallava NandivarmanII, but also for his benevolence towards the people and the monuments of Kanchipuram, the Pallava capital. He thus avenged the earlier <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> the Chalukyas by the Pallavas and engraved a Kannada inscription on the victory pillar at the Kailasanatha Temple. During his reign Arab intruders of the Umayyad Caliphate invaded southern Gujarat which was under Chalukya rule but the Arabs were defeated and driven out by Pulakesi, a Chalukya governor of Navsari. He later overran the other traditional kingdoms of Tamil country, the Pandyas, the Cholas and the Cheras in addition to subduing a Kalabhra ruler. The last Chalukya king, KirtivarmanII, was overthrown by the Rashtrakuta King Dantidurga in 753. At their peak, the Chalukyas ruled a vast empire stretching from the Kaveri in the south to the Narmada in the north.|$|E
