25|$|Zanfona (Spain). Typically guitar-shaped body, {{with three}} melody strings, and two drone strings. Some older {{examples}} had a diatonic keyboard, and most modern models have a chromatic keyboard. Zanfonas are usually {{tuned to the}} key of C major, with the melody strings tuned in unison to G above the middle C on the piano. The drones are: the bordonciño in G (one octave below the melody strings) and the bordón in C (two octaves below middle C). Sometimes, two of the melody strings are in unison, and the remaining string is tuned an octave lower, in unison with the bordonciño (this string was sometimes known as the human voice, because <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> someone is humming the melody an octave lower).|$|E
500|$|Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{gave the}} album {{one out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "the cheapest-sounding record in recent memory; <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was {{recorded}} in less time that it takes to play." [...] He did note Hung's improvement as a vocalist, saying that [...] "he sings with more confidence and at least vaguely sings something resembling the melody." [...] The New York Daily News called the album a cult classic.|$|E
500|$|While {{other members}} went to local pubs, Araya spent his free hours reading factual books {{regarding}} serial killers, including Gordon Burn's Happy Like Murderers: The Story of Fred and Rosemary West. Araya was seeking inspiration, and aimed to sound convincing while singing the lyrics, avoiding himself {{to sound like}} a gimmick. Araya sang the lyrics more [...] "over-the-top" [...] than done on previous albums, as King's writing style is more [...] "aggro." [...] This resulted in Kerrang! reviewer Jason Arnopp describing the album's lyrics as [...] "so packed with foul and abusive language that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> D-12 and the Sopranos family were going head-to-head in a celebrity swearathon." ...|$|E
60|$|But to Gerald <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were insistent {{rather than}} confident.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Chick-a-dee-dee, ma'am, chick-a-dee-dee!'" [...] {{answered}} the {{bird in the}} same cheerful tone. And <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he said, 'I shall be cared for. I'm not afraid.' ...|$|R
50|$|The British version, by Alain Legrand, {{removed the}} vocals and {{increased}} the tempo of the tune while making <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were played on a fairground organ.|$|R
500|$|Thom Jurek of Allmusic {{wrote that}} the album [...] "feels more like a band record than {{anything}} [...] done in decades". He praises Clarke's choice in bandmates, calling them [...] "prodigies in their own right" [...] but does not praise the whole album. He called [...] "Larry Has Traveled 11 Miles and Waited a Lifetime for the Return of Vishnu's Report" [...] a [...] "clumsy, failed attempt at summing up the music's history to date" [...] and that [...] "Bass Folk Song No. 6" [...] does not [...] "work [...] well" [...] {{as some of the}} other tracks but [...] "these are minor complaints on an otherwise fine recording". Jeff Winbush of All About Jazz commented that there [...] "are no radical departures" [...] on this album and <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Clarke is [...] "taking a victory lap here, revisiting past triumphs" [...] but that he [...] "still pull sounds out of his assortment of electric, acoustic and Alembic basses like nobody else, and [...] still slapping, plucking and thumbing his way through contemporary, fusion jazz, rock, funk and whatever else he puts his mind to".|$|E
2500|$|David Brooks {{reviewed}} the follow-up {{book about the}} next generation titled Millennials Rising (2000). [...] "Millennials" [...] is a term coined by Strauss and Howe. Brooks wrote: “This {{is not a good}} book, if by good you mean the kind of book in which the authors have rigorously sifted the evidence and carefully supported their assertions with data. But it is a very good bad book. It's stuffed with interesting nuggets. It's brightly written. And if you get away from the generational mumbo jumbo, it illuminates changes that really do seem to be taking place.” [...] Further, Mr. Brooks wrote that the generations aren't treated equally: [...] "Basically, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> America has two greatest generations {{at either end of the}} age scale and two crummiest in the middle".|$|E
2500|$|Tracy E. Hopkins of Barnes & Noble {{wrote that}} the song [...] "won't wow too many fans with its nursery rhyme-like." [...] Spence D. of IGN was mixed, writing, [...] "The {{obligatory}} star power guest shot occurs with 'Call On Me' featuring Nelly. Janet goes for her delicate wisp, but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she's trying hard to maintain the crispness, straining to keep from cracking. Nelly delivers a slippery grind, making this also the obligatory 'time to get your sex on' number." [...] Don Baiocchi of Blogcritics was mixed, writing that [...] "to kick off a comeback with the mediocre 'Call On Me,' a duet where she actually makes Nelly sing, is just plain wrong. 'Call on Me' wasn't {{the way to do}} that." [...] He also noted that [...] "details like the tiny hand claps in 'Call On Me' are bizarre missteps." [...] Evan Serpick of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "it shamelessly re-creates 'Dilemma,' the St. Louis rapper's collaboration with Kelly Rowland." [...] Johnny Loftus of Metro Times was also negative, writing that the song [...] "falls flat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, do {{call him}} in and make him dance!" [...] cried the girls, all {{chirping}} at once, till <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a flock of sparrows had taken possession of the shed.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} moment the {{children}} fired, the Indians in hiding discharged their weapons, detonations being echoed and reëchoed from mountain to mountain, until <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a severe engagement was in progress.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he {{were asking}} if he had caught cold or hurt his foot, and Strether for a minute but smoked and smoked. [...] "I {{want to see her}} again. I must see her." ...|$|R
60|$|JULIA. Don't say that: I hate it. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were a mere animal.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{favourite}} indoor sport!" [...] said Freddie with enthusiasm. [...] "Hullo! What's up? <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{there were}} dirty {{work at the}} cross-roads!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, dear. I know <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{all their}} insides {{were coming out}} of their mouth. But we want to be serenaded, don't we, nurse?--" ...|$|E
60|$|Again {{and again}} the {{question}} was asked, and the answer became fainter and fainter, although <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was a distant cry in response to Rujub's shout rather than spoken in an ordinary voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's splendid!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} {{and he could}} not doubt the {{approval}} in her voice. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she meant to applaud him as well as show her satisfaction with the consequences of his exploit.|$|R
50|$|The musicians {{included}} the Everlys on guitars, Floyd Cramer on piano, Floyd Chance on bass and Buddy Harman on drums. The distinctive drum sound {{was achieved by}} recording the drums with a tape loop, making <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there were two drummers.|$|R
60|$|Lady Bracknell. This {{noise is}} {{extremely}} unpleasant. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{he was having}} an argument. I dislike arguments of any kind. They are always vulgar, and often convincing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not entirely, if it please your honour," [...] said Joceline; [...] "but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{you were}} preaching a sermon, {{and has a}} marvellous twang of {{doctrine}} with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not--if {{it means}} what <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it did," [...] Jacob replied. [...] "I am asked here because I am very rich {{and because the}} Marquis is {{interested}} in money-making schemes. Do you like being a nursery governess?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "By {{fostering}} {{better life}} decisions and stronger relationship skills, marriage programs can increase child well-being and adult happiness and reduce child poverty and welfare dependence. Yet opponents make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{the government would}} be forcing people into unhappy unions. It's nonsense." ...|$|R
5000|$|Audiomatic - This is a {{sound effects}} unit that adds vintage audio quirks to music, making <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were being played back from past devices such as analog tape, a vinyl record, a {{crackling}} radio, an old television set, etc.|$|R
60|$|Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock {{grappled with}} Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, {{and there was}} a terrific battle all over the kitchen. To the rabbits {{underneath}} <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the floor would give way at each crash of falling furniture.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't {{listen to}} such talk, daddy; for <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{you were out}} of your head again, as when we were alone that night. You'll perk up after we're at Antelope Spring, an' show the people there what you can do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What kind of years?" [...] "Why, latter years-- [...] Different {{from early}} years." [...] "I see them, too. [...] You didn't count them?" [...] "No, the further off [...] So ran {{together}} that I didn't try to. [...] It can scarce {{be that they}} would be in number [...] We'd care to know, for we are not young now. [...] And bang goes something else away off there. [...] <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were the men went down, [...] And every crash meant one less to return [...] To lighted city streets we, too, have known, [...] But now are giving up for country darkness." ...|$|E
60|$|Every summer I suffer {{much from}} indignation. I {{love to watch}} the {{swallows}} building. They build beneath the eaves outside my study window. Such cheerful little chatter-boxes they are. Long after sunset, when all the other birds are sleeping, the swallows still are chattering softly. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were telling one another some pretty story, and often I am sure there must be humour in it, for {{every now and then}} one hears a little twittering laugh. I delight in having them there, so close to me. The fancy comes to me that one day, when my brain has grown more cunning, I, too, listening in the twilight, shall hear the stories that they tell.|$|E
50|$|During the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, Giants radio {{flagship}} KNBR rebroadcast Game 7, electronically re-editing NBC Radio announcer George Kell's description to make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> McCovey's ninth-inning liner {{had gotten}} past Richardson, with Alou and Mays scoring {{to win the}} game and Series for San Francisco.|$|R
5000|$|... "You make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{all we have}} to do to win is not lose. It’s {{not that}} easy! You don’t win wars just by not losing. People need a victory, they need to prove themselves… We’ve got to beat the Luftwaffe just to show it can be done." ...|$|R
60|$|Hardly had Peter {{curled up}} for that nap {{when he heard a}} voice. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> came from a long way off, but he knew just where it came from. It came from the doorway of that old house. He knew, too, whose voice it was. It was Jimmy Skunk's voice.|$|R
60|$|There is a rough boat here, and we {{will get}} into it and have a row over this dark and gloomy river. Whenever our guide shouts we hear the wildest kind of echoes, and {{everything}} seems solemn and unearthly. At one time our boat stops for a moment, and the guide goes on shore, and directly we hear the most awful crash imaginable. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a dozen gong-factories had blown up at once, and we nearly {{jump out of the}} boat! But we soon see that it was nothing but the guide striking on a piece of sheet-iron or tin. The echoes, one after another, from this noise had produced the horrible crashing sounds we had heard.|$|E
6000|$|By {{and by a}} fat hen {{walked over}} to the bars of the cowyard and hopped up on the lower bar. There she sat for some time. Then, making up her mind that she would see what was outside, she hopped down and {{walked over to the}} pile of old boards. Right then things {{happened}} all at once. That red spot behind the pile of old boards suddenly came to life. There was a quick spring, and that fat hen was seized by the neck so suddenly that she didn't have time to make a sound. At the same instant the black spot in the top of the tall tree came to life, and Blacky the Crow flew over to the roof of the barn, screaming at the top of his lungs. Now those who know Blacky well, know when he is screaming [...] "Fox! Fox! Fox!" [...] although <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were saying [...] "Caw! Caw! Caw!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a difference," [...] said Anne meditatively. [...] "I think it's because Ruby {{is really}} so CONSCIOUS of boys. She plays at love and love-making. Besides, you feel, {{when she is}} boasting of her beaux that she is doing it to rub it well into you that you haven't half so many. Now, when Phil talks of her beaux <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she was just {{speaking}} of chums. She really looks upon boys as good comrades, and she is pleased when she has dozens of them tagging round, simply because she likes to be popular and to be thought popular. Even Alex and Alonzo--I'll {{never be able to}} think of those two names separately after this--are to her just two playfellows who want her to play with them all their lives. I'm glad we met her, and I'm glad we went to Old St. John's. I believe I've put forth a tiny soul-root into Kingsport soil this afternoon. I hope so. I hate to feel transplanted." ...|$|E
50|$|John {{was famous}} for his nose whistle, a {{whistling}} sound he would make, both on purpose and involuntarily, through his nose. The nose whistle {{was also one of}} John's tactics for making opposing lawyers nervous in court since John was also capable of making <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the whistle came from someone else's nose.|$|R
5000|$|Casting Crowns' Mark Hall (lead singer) {{states that}} when he was a teenager, he heard a song being played with just a {{keyboard}} in the background. He liked that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the singer was right there with him in that room. This is where [...] "The Acoustic Sessions: Volume One" [...] was born.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album 4½ stars stating [...] "Although {{the title of}} this CD makes <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> tenor-saxophonist Joe Lovano was {{performing}} veteran jazz classics on this date, {{all but one of the}} ten songs played by his quintet are actually Lovano originals... Lovano is consistently creative during the modern mainstream music".|$|R
