5|$|After 1912, when Skopje was annexed by Serbia, {{the city}} was {{drastically}} westernised. Wealthy Serbs built mansions and town houses such as the 1926 Ristiḱ Palace. Architecture of that time {{is very similar to}} the one of Central Europe, but some buildings are more creative, such as the Neo-Moorish Arab House and the Neo-Byzantine train station, both built in 1938. Modernism appeared as early as 1933 with the former Ethnographic Museum (today the City Gallery), designed by Milan Zloković. However, modernist architecture only fully developed in Skopje after the 1963 earthquake. The reconstruction of city centre was partially planned by Japanese Kenzo Tange who designed the new train station. Macedonian architects also took part to the reconstruction: Georgi Konstantinovski designed the City Archives building in 1968 and the <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> Goce Delčev in 1975, while Janko Konstantinov designed the Telecommunication Centre and the main post office (1974–1989). Slavko Brezovski designed the Church of St. Clement of Ohrid. These two buildings are noted for their originality although they are directly inspired by brutalism.|$|E
5|$|Elliott entered Ormond College, the Presbyterian <b>hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> at the University of Melbourne in 1898 {{to study}} law.

In March 1900, the Imperial authorities asked the Australian colonial governments to raise a force of 2,500 Imperial Bushmen for service in the South African War.
