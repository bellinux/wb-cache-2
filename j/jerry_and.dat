5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the episode were cut prior to broadcast.

Another scene which was cut featured Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) entering Jerry's apartment carrying a plate with cantaloupe on toothpicks. Originally, the scene in which Jerry tells George that he is dating Marlene took place in a library, with a librarian repeatedly shushing George and <b>Jerry</b> <b>and</b> kicking them out of the library {{at the end of the}} scene.

5|$|Storm surge {{and rough}} surf {{along the coast}} of Texas {{destroyed}} a 20-mile (32km) section of Texas State Highway 87, which was never repaired. Due to strong winds, about 52,000homes and businesses were left without electricity, most of them in the Galveston area. Many homes, businesses, and buildings were inflicted damage because of strong winds and three tornadoes spawned by the storm. Despite the issuance of a hurricane warning just eight hours prior to landfall, Jerry caused only three fatalities in Texas, possibly due to the storm's small size; a car fell over the Galveston Seawall, killing its three occupants. Minor wind and coastal flood damage was reported in Louisiana. <b>Jerry</b> <b>and</b> its remnants brought flash flooding to portions of the Upland South, particularly in the states of Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia. In eastern Kentucky, hundreds of homes were flooded and many bridges, culverts, and roads were washed out; this left hundreds of residents stranded. Damage in Kentucky reached at least $5million. Similar impact occurred in Virginia; with $3.4million (1989USD) in damage in Buchanan County. In West Virginia, overflowing rivers in the western portions of the state forced hundreds to evacuate. Throughout the United States, Jerry resulted in about $70million in damage.|$|E
