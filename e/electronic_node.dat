40|$|In many novel {{industrial}} applications, piezoelectric transducers (PZT) {{are used}} in sensing or actuating systems. These applications could be, for example, piezo-based structural health monitoring systems for aircrafts or active vibration reducing systems for automotive. Due {{to the fact that}} PZT materials are brittle, depolarize at high-temperature exposure or that the bonding layer to host structures for bonded transducers can degrade, monitoring of the reliability of these transducers is crucial to guarantee proper system operation. The electromechanical impedance (EMI) method allows monitoring of structural changes with only a single PZT applied to the surface of a structure. In the data analysis, it is furthermore possible to distinguish whether the host structure, the PZT material itself, or the bonding between PZT material and host structure is affected by damage. Object of this work is the implementation of the electromechanical impedance method on a compact, <b>electronic</b> <b>node.</b> Investigations of the EMI method and verification of the <b>electronic</b> <b>node</b> are conducted on an aerospace conform fiber reinforced plastic structure.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} {{on how to}} reduce the internode communication latency in distributed multiprocessor systems. The strategy consists of replacing the "store and forward" mechanism that is usually carried out on each <b>electronic</b> <b>node</b> by a free diffusion of optical packets along an optical bus. No routing, no extraction of optical packets and no access arbitration into the bus are needed. Intermediate nodes between two processors engaged in a communication are optically transparent. These specifications considerably simplify the optoelectronic interface of the node and reduce the latency of communication. In the asynchronous operation mode that we consider, each node multiplexer inserts on the fly optical packets into the bus. The optical demultiplexer identifies the packet destination address before transmitting the data to the node electronics.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{reduction}} of the internode communication latency in distributed-memory multiprocessor machines on the assumption of developing a new generation of optical busses. We consider quasi-transparent optical busses which convey optical packets in the asynchronous mode. The critical property of these busses is that the intranode latency is small compared to the internode propagation time so that the propagation of packets along the bus is determined by the sole velocity of light in the fibers. For 2 D networks, this is just the contrary: the <b>electronic</b> <b>node</b> processing time generally controls the propagation of messages. We show that the optical bus outdoes several 2 D electronic topologies both for the shortness of the latency and for the magnitude of the bandwidth.

40|$|Wearable health-monitoring {{systems are}} {{becoming}} very popular, especially in enabling the noninvasive diagnosis of vital {{functions of the}} human body. Besides typical singular heartbeat or perspiration sensors, which have been commercially available in recent years, the deployment {{of a series of}} body-worn sensors can enable an effective health-monitoring mechanism. The combined information obtained from such systems can either be relayed directly to any health-monitoring personnel in the case of emergencies or can be logged and analyzed as a part of preventive health measures. However, the deployment of on-body nodes for humans must be performed with care, as they may interfere with the patients' regular movements. This is especially challenging because the relationship between the electromagnetic waves is influenced by the patient's movements, distance from the nearest base station, operating environment, etc. Additional challenges to the deployment of such mechanisms are also faced in situations where the nodes require additional on-body space, impose additional weight, or are not conformal enough to the patient's body. On the hardware design aspect, the sensory and communication functions on the <b>electronic</b> <b>node</b> have to be designed using special materials to avoid reliability issues or damage due to repeated or intense movements.

40|$|Since charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) {{reactions}} {{represent the}} simplest class of solvent-driven electron transfer reactions, {{there has been}} considerable interest in understanding the solvent motions responsible for electron ejection. The major question that we explore in this paper is what role the symmetry of the electronic states plays in determining the solvent motions that account for CTTS. To this end, we have performed a series of one-electron mixed quantum/classical nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations of the CTTS dynamics of sodide, Na-, which has its ground-state electron in an s orbital and solvent-supported CTTS excited states of p-like symmetry. We compare our simulations to previous theoretical work on the CTTS dynamics of the aqueous halides, in which the ground state has the electron in a p orbital and the CTTS excited state has s-like symmetry. We find that the key motions for Na- relaxation involve translations of solvent molecules into the node of the p-like CTTS excited state. This solvation of the <b>electronic</b> <b>node</b> leads to migration of the excited CTTS electron, leaving one of the p-like lobes pinned to the sodium atom core and the other extended into the solvent; this nodal migration causes a breakdown of linear response. Most importantly, for the nonadiabatic transition out of the CTTS excited state and the subsequent return to equilibrium, we find dramatic differences between the relaxation dynamics of sodide and the halides that result directly from differences in electronic symmetry. Since the ground state of the ejected electron is s-like, detachment from the s-like CTTS excited state of the halides occurs directly, but detachment cannot occur from the p-like CTTS excited state of Na- without a nonadiabatic transition to remove the node. Thus, unlike the halides, CTTS electron detachment from sodide occurs only after relaxation to the ground state and is a relatively rare event. In addition, {{the fact that the}} electronic symmetry of sodide is the same as for the hydrated electron enables us to directly study the effect of a stabilizing atomic core on the properties and solvation dynamics of solvent-supported electronic states. All the results are compared to experimental work on Na- CTTS dynamics, and a unified picture for the electronic relaxation for solvent-supported excited states of any symmetry is presented.

40|$|Today's {{telecommunications}} networks are still largely optically opaque - consisting of <b>electronic</b> <b>nodes</b> connected by point-to-point optical links, {{relying on a}} series of optical-electrical conversions. Moving to all-optical switching will allow increased bit rates and low latency movement of data, providing greater routing agility, reducing energy requirements and simplifying network structures.

Future network architectures will require a new generation of highly integrated devices capable of functions such as all-optical switching and mode (de) multiplexing.

30|$|The non-full-availability {{group is}} the {{so-called}} state-dependent system [14, 15]. This dependence results from the particular structure of the system in which calls arriving at the input {{have access to a}} limited amount of resources, substantially lower than the total capacity of the system. Until the 1980 s, non-full-availability groups with single-service traffic were used in electromechanical switching nodes of telecommunications networks. With the advent of <b>electronic</b> <b>nodes,</b> groups of this type ceased to be used in their direct form, though they were, and still are, used in analytical models of more complex systems, such as, for example, single- and multi-service switching networks [16 – 18], network systems with reservation [19, 20], systems with traffic overflow [21 – 23], video on demand (VoD) systems [24, 25], or radio and Iub interfaces of the UMTS system [26 – 28]. One of the most extensive elaborations on non-full-availability groups is provided in the [29]. This paper presents all of the most important methods of modelling single-service non-full-availability groups. Among different types of the non-full-availability group, particular attention should be given to Erlang’s ideal grading, the structure of which and the first single-service analytical model was presented by Erlang [30]. The first model of the ideal grading with multi-service traffic and identical value of the availability parameter for all classes of calls serviced by the group is proposed in [13]. Stasiak and Hanczewski [31] discuss a model of the group with multi-service traffic and a variable value of the availability parameter. This model is then expanded to include the possibility of performing calculations for non-integer vales of availability [31]. The most extensive description of multi-service non-full-availability groups is provided in [14] in which different models of multi-service ideal non-full-availability groups, defined for different types of call streams and different structures of groups, are presented.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- We {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} optical network designs using relatively few switch nodes at which wavelength conversion and electronic regeneration is possible. A simple heuristic for placing the fewest such nodes to reach a given blocking probability {{is based on the}} ranked frequency of shortest-path routes transiting each node. This strategy is found to be efficient in designing a “translucent ” optical network with sparse electronic switch placement that performs very close in blocking to that of an “opaque ” optical network. In addition, we apply a new 2 -D Dijkstra’s algorithm for routing and wavelength assignment in the resultant translucent optical network. Simulation results indicate that a translucent optical network with sparse electronic switch placement based on the heuristic has much lower blocking than a fully transparent optical network when the constraint of the maximum transparent distance before regeneration is also considered. Moreover by placing the switches according to the heuristic, lightpath blocking can approach that of a fully opaque network with significantly fewer electronic switches in total. In our results, lightpath blocking as low as the fully opaque network case was obtained with electronic switches selectively placed at approximately 1 node in 3 on average. The heuristic also performs well against random searching for an effective subset of <b>electronic</b> switch <b>nodes</b> and performs better than a prior optima...|$|R

The largest obstacle became the design and production of the circui...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} optical network designs using relatively few switch nodes at which wavelength conversion and electronic regeneration is possible. A simple heuristic for placing the fewest such nodes to reach a given blocking probability {{is based on the}} ranked frequency of shortest-path routes transiting each node. This strategy is found to be efficient in designing a translu-cent optical network with sparse electronic switch placement that performs very close in blocking to that of an opaque optical network. In addition, we apply a new two-dimensional Dijkstra algorithm for routing and wavelength assignment in the resultant translucent optical network. Simulation results indicate that a translucent optical network with sparse electronic switch placement based on the heuristic has much lower blocking than a fully transparent optical network when the constraint of the maximum transparent distance before regeneration is also considered. Moreover, when the switches are placed according to the heuristic, lightpath blocking can approach that of a fully opaque network with significantly fewer total electronic switches. In our results, lightpath blocking as low as that with the fully opaque network case was obtained with electronic switches selectively placed at approximately one node in three on average. The heuristic also performs well against random searching for an effective subset of <b>electronic</b> switch <b>nodes</b> and performs better than a prior optimal method that is based on a combinatorially exhaustive search and that is limited to assuming fixed shortest-path routing. © 2002 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 060. 4250, 060. 4510. 1...|$|R
30|$|As {{an issue}} for consideration, delay {{tomography}} burdens source and destination nodes with clock synchronization between them. A packet route delay, which is required in the formulation, can be known from the transmission time at a source node and the reception time at a destination node, so precise clock synchronization between them seems essential and unavoidable, {{but it is difficult}} in reality. In wireless sensor networks, the <b>electronic</b> components of <b>nodes</b> are sometimes too untrustable to meet the requirement of clock synchronization in terms of precision and complexity [16, 17]. Global positioning system (GPS) may provide precise clock synchronization among wireless nodes [18], but all nodes cannot be equipped with GPS receivers. Network time protocol (NTP) [19] is applicable and several methods using the medium access control layer (MAC) time stamp [20 – 22] have been proposed for clock synchronization, but they require all nodes to exchange packets specialized for clock synchronization. It must be more energy-efficient to accomplish active delay tomography without the use of such specialized packets.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Optical Packet Switched (OPS) {{networks}} {{are known to}} suffer from high packet losses due to contentions. Techniques such as fiber delay line (FDL) buffering and wavelength conversion help to relieve contentions to an extent, but are expensive and are therefore used sparingly. This pa-per explores how <b>electronic</b> edge <b>nodes</b> can condition the traffic entering the OPS network {{with the objective of}} utilising the few available FDLs (or wavelength converters) more effectively to reduce contention losses further within the all-optical core. The benefits of ingress traffic conditioning in electronic {{networks are}} well known, but we believe its advantages for OPS networks with sparse contention resolution resources have not been fully evaluated. This paper considers a time-slotted OPS network comprising core nodes with limited FDL buffering. The edge-nodes are allowed to condition the ingress traffic by controlling the release of packets into the optical network in accordance with a particular scheme. In this context, our contributions are two-fold. First, we show analytically that for an optical switch with given FDL buffer-ing capacity, contention losses on its output link can be minimised by evenly spacing packets on that link. This motivates edge traffic conditioning as an effective means of reducing contention losses in the OPS core. However, ingress traffic conditioning incurs a penalty, namely an increased queue-ing delay at the edge node. As our second contribution, we quantify via simulation the reduction in packet losses and the accompanying increase in end-to-end delay as the traffic conditioning varies. Our simulated OPS net-work topology is based on an actual trans-continental Australian network called CeNTIE (a research network in the same vein as Internet 2 and Ca-narie), modeled with realistic traffic flows carrying long-range dependent traffic. We believe our proposal can assist a network operator to trade-off delay for loss when choosing an operating point for the OPS network...|$|R
