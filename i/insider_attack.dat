50|$|On 1 January, {{an armed}} group of Taliban fighters ambushed {{a group of}} 40 policemen as they were eating lunch in the remote village of Shaghzay. A number of Taliban fighters {{infiltrated}} through the village {{and set up the}} well planned and coordinated assault on Afghan security forces. An Afghan police officer who survived the attack said it started when militants began shooting at policemen killing many. Policemen then turned their weapons on each other, defecting to the Taliban. The rest of the remaining officers were slaughtered with hails of gunfire then they were beheaded and had their bodies mutilated. Eight Afghan policemen managed to escape to a nearby town. The mother of one of the slain policemen was also killed when she pleaded for her son's live. Residents in the village claimed that the bodies of the policemen were scattered along the road, one said he counted the bodies of two dead Taliban fighters as well. Police reinforcements arrived an hour later and successfully took back Shaghzay, after the Taliban abandoned the town along with several defected police officers. The Taliban claimed it was an <b>insider</b> <b>attack</b> as one former policemen gave them information about the police group and when to ambush them, in return he defected.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are {{especially}} useful in providing mission critical {{services such as}} in emergency networks or battlefield scenarios. However, DTNs are vulnerable to <b>insider</b> <b>attacks,</b> in which the legitimate nodes are compromised and the adversary nodes launch blackhole attacks by dropping packets in the networks. The traditional approaches of securing routing protocols can not address such <b>insider</b> <b>attacks</b> in DTNs. In this paper, we propose a method to secure the history records of packet delivery information at each contact so that other nodes can detect <b>insider</b> <b>attacks</b> by analyzing these packet delivery records.

40|$|Abstract—The Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are {{vulnerable}} to <b>insider</b> <b>attacks,</b> in which the legitimate nodes are compromised and the adversary modifies the delivery metrics of the node to launch harmful attacks in the networks. The traditional detection approaches of secure routing protocols can not address such kind of <b>insider</b> <b>attacks</b> in DTNs. In this paper, we propose a mutual correlation detection scheme (MUTON) for addressing these <b>insider</b> <b>attacks.</b> MUTON takes into consideration of the transitive property when calculating the packet delivery probability of each node and correlates the information collected from other nodes.

40|$|Abstract. An {{authenticated}} group key exchange (AGKE) protocol allows {{participants to}} construct a common key and provide secure group communications in cooperative and distributed applications. Recently, Choi et al. proposed an identity (ID) -based authenticated group key exchange (IDAGKE) protocol from bilinear pairings. However, their protocol suffered from an <b>insider</b> colluding <b>attack</b> because it didn’t realize the security issue of withstanding <b>insider</b> <b>attacks.</b> Withstanding <b>insider</b> <b>attacks</b> mean that it can detect whether malicious participants exist in the group key exchange pro-tocol. Nevertheless, an AGKE protocol resistant to <b>insider</b> <b>attacks</b> is still unable to find “who are malicious participants”. In this paper, we propose an ID-based AGKE protocol with identifying malicious participants. In our protocol, we use a confirmed computation property to achieve identi-fying malicious participants. Certainly, it is also secure against <b>insider</b> <b>attacks.</b> In the random oracle model and under related mathematical hard problems, we prove that the proposed protocol a secure AGKE protocol with identifying malicious participants...|$|R

30|$|The {{vulnerability}} of sensor nodes makes them potential victims of cyber/physical attacks driven by intelligent adversaries. Attacks to information networks are usually categorized into outsider <b>attacks</b> and <b>insider</b> <b>attacks.</b> Outsider attacks include (distributed) {{denial of service}} (DoS) attacks, which use the broadcasting nature for wireless communications to disrupt the communications capabilities [10]. In contrast, in <b>insider</b> <b>attacks</b> the adversary “recruits” sensor nodes by malware through cyber/wireless means, or directly by physical substitution [13]. Following the classical Byzantine generals problem [14], these “Byzantine nodes” are authenticated, and recognized as valid members of the network. Byzantine nodes can hence generate false data, exhibit arbitrary behaviour, and collude with others to create network malfunctions. In general, <b>insider</b> <b>attacks</b> {{are considered to be}} more potentially harmful to information networks than outside attacks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Almost {{all systems}} {{all over the}} world suffer from {{outsider}} and <b>insider</b> <b>attacks.</b> Outsider attacks are those that come from outside the system, however, <b>insider</b> <b>attacks</b> are those that are launched from insiders of the system. In this paper we concentrate on <b>insider</b> <b>attacks</b> detection on the application level; database is our focus. <b>Insider</b> <b>attacks</b> differ from outsider attacks in many ways; most importantly, insiders have more knowledge about the underlying systems. Because of their knowledge and their privileges of the system resources; their risk can be greater and more severe. In fact, insiders can find vulnerabilities in the system easily. Several techniques have been proposed that tackled the insider threat problem, but most of them concentrate on insider threat detection in computer system level. We describe a method for insider threat detection in database systems that handle entrants on the role of <b>insiders</b> for such <b>attacks.</b> Our simulation results show resistance against such attacks. Also, our results show good performance in terms of reducing false alarms to the minimum.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a systematic analysis}} of <b>insider</b> <b>attacks</b> against mobile ad-hoc routing protocols, using the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol as an example. It identifies a number of attack goals and then study how to achieve these goals through misuses of the routing messages. To facilitate the analysis, this paper classifies the <b>insider</b> <b>attacks</b> into two categories: atomic misuses and compound misuses. Atomic misuses are performed by manipulating a single routing message, which cannot be further divided; compound misuses are composed of combinations of atomic misuses and possibly normal uses of the routing protocol. The analysis results in this paper reveal several classes of <b>insider</b> <b>attacks,</b> including route disruption, route invasion, node isolation, and resource consumption. This paper also includes simulation results that demonstrate {{the impact of these}} attacks. ...|$|R

40|$|Cyber {{intrusion}} {{is becoming}} an increasingly global and urgent problem. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are deployed to identify intrusions and mitigate their damage.

However, insider attackers may severely degrade the efficiency of CIDNs. This paper provides a survey of some CIDNs and analyzes their robustness against <b>insider</b> <b>attacks.</b> We first classify network intrusions, IDSs, and <b>insider</b> <b>attacks</b> for CIDNs according to their behaviors and the techniques they use.

40|$|Abstract—In {{geographic}} routing a node forwards data packets to {{a neighbor}} which {{is closer to the}} destination than itself. However, most of the existing geographic routing protocols have not been designed to work effectively in scenarios with malicious nodes. Some protocols use cryptographic schemes, reputation schemes and other sorts of complex and costly (especially for a wireless sensor network) solutions to provide security to the routing protocols. Moreover, these schemes are not able to deal with attacks from legitimate nodes compromised (<b>insider</b> <b>attacks).</b> We analyze in detail the effects of <b>insider</b> <b>attacks</b> (Sybil and Sinkhole) in beaconless geographic routing protocols and propose a Self-Protected Beaconless Geographic Routing (SBGR) protocol. We show that by just enhancing the forwarding logic of our routing protocol to make additional transmissions when suspicious traffic is detected, we can deal with these <b>insider</b> <b>attacks</b> without the extra cost and overhead of deploying complex reputation systems.

40|$|The {{security}} problems of {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSN) have attracted people’s wide attention.

Therefore, a reliable secure routing protocol should be proposed in order to defense the <b>insider</b> <b>attack.</b> In this paper, we focus on insider selective forwarding attack. The existing detection mechanisms, such as watchdog, multipath retreat, neighbor-based monitoring and so on, have both advantages and disadvantages. According to their characteristics, we proposed a secure routing protocol based on monitor node and trust mechanism. The reputation value is made up with packet forwarding rate and node’s residual energy. So this detection and routing mechanism is universal because it can take account of both the safety and lifetime of network. Finally, we use OPNET simulation to verify the performance of our algorithm...|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} for understanding and predicting insider attacks In this paper an <b>insider</b> <b>attack</b> {{is considered to be}} deliberate misuse by those who are authorized to use computers and networks. Applying this definition in real-life settings {{to determine whether or not}} an attack was caused by an insider is often, however, anything but straightforward. We know very little about insider attacks, and misconceptions concerning insider attacks abound. The belief that “most attacks come from inside ” is held by many information security professionals, for example, even though empirical statistics and firewall logs indicate otherwise. This paper presents a framework based on previous studies and models of insider behavior as well as firsthand experience in dealing with insider attacks. This framework defines relevant types of insider attack-related behaviors and symptoms—“indicators ” that include deliberate markers, meaningful errors, preparatory behaviors, correlated usage patterns, verbal behavior and personality traits. From these sets of indicators, clues can be pieced together to predict and detect an attack. The presence of numerous small clues necessitates the use of quantitative methods; multiple regression equations appear to be a particularly promising approach for quantifying prediction.
