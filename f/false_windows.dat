It has sash windows {{to the south}} and north, with <b>false</b> <b>windows</b> on the east and west ends. Access to the pool is through the ground floor lobby of the cottage. Inside, the original panelled ceiling remains intact as well as a hob and fireplace in the bedroom and another early 19th-century fireplace on the ground floor. On either side of the cottage are six changing cubicles with sloping roofs covered with asbestos sheets. At the western end are two further dressing rooms and the perpetual shower which was linked to the ladies' pool.|$|E
25|$|Beyond the Great Hall is {{the dining}} room for the courtiers in {{attendance}} (the Courtiers-in-Attendance Dining Room). The room was designed by Rastrelli in the mid-18th century. The small room is lit by four windows which look out into the formal courtyard. The architect placed <b>false</b> <b>windows</b> with mirrors and mirrored glass on the opposite wall, making the hall more spacious and bright. Decorated in the typical baroque interior style, the hall is filled with gilded wall-carvings, complex gilded pieces on the doors, and ornamental patterns of stylized flowers. The ceiling mural was painted by a well-known student of the Russian School from the mid-18th century. It {{is based on the}} Greek myth of the sun god Helios and the goddess of the dawn, Eos.|$|E
2500|$|In 1747, {{the broad}} frieze below the dome with its <b>false</b> <b>windows</b> was [...] "restored," [...] but bore little {{resemblance}} to the original. In {{the early decades of the}} 20th century, a piece of the original, as could be reconstructed from Renaissance drawings and paintings, was recreated in one of the panels.|$|E
5000|$|Smedestraat 33 (Smedestraat 33) is {{the address}} of a doorway in Haarlem. The {{brickwork}} of the doorway, including a round <b>false</b> <b>window,</b> is from {{the second half of}} the 17th century, and has been declared one of the national monuments of The Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|The great arched window {{over the}} {{entrance}} {{is a false}} as the grand lobby is approximately 40 ft behind the <b>window.</b> This <b>false</b> <b>window</b> (largest {{of its kind in}} the country) has a curved back wall with over 50 ornate mirrors that reflected the light from chandelier out to the street. Although the tall narrow chandelier is gone, new lighting has been installed within the 5 story tall window chamber.|$|R
5000|$|The main temple has square ground plan. The {{entrance}} into the garbhagriha (main room) is located on west side, flanked with two <b>false</b> <b>window,</b> or niches adorned with kala-makara decoration. On the north, east, and southern walls there are three niches on each side also adorned in kala-makara style. The center niche are slightly higher than other two flanking niches. These niches are now empty, probably these niches once contains Hindu murti (statues).|$|R
2500|$|Decorative {{features}} include lavish stonework and finials {{on the west}} wing bay window and <b>false</b> <b>windows</b> on the kitchen chimney stack wall creating a decorative feature on a plain wall. The Legh Keck coat of arms is carved in stone above the front porch, with two carved green men {{on either side of}} the doors. Other features from the 1832 renovation include Legh Keck's initials [...] "G.A.L.K" [...] and [...] "1833" [...] inscribed above the Italian bay windows. There were once cast iron ram's heads holding laurel sprigs and maiden's heads on the building. The lead rain hoppers have the initials as above and there are stone statues on the tower battlements. Another feature is the chimney stacks, which are diamond shaped, while others are square and the chimneys on the west wing are octagonal. The clocks on the tower feature a fleur-de-lis at each corner of their faces, thought to be from the Bannastre family coat of arms.|$|E
60|$|Poverty has its whims {{and shows}} of taste, as wealth has. Some of these cabins were turreted, some had <b>false</b> <b>windows</b> painted on their rotten walls; {{one had a}} mimic clock, upon a crazy tower of four feet high, which {{screened}} the chimney; each in its little patch of ground had a rude seat or arbour. The population dealt in bones, in rags, in broken glass, in old wheels, in birds, and dogs. These, in their several ways of stowage, filled the gardens; and shedding a perfume, not of the most delicious nature, in the air, filled it besides with yelps, and screams, and howling.|$|E
6000|$|... {{drove the}} English from French soil. His house, which to-day {{is used as}} a Palais de Justice, appears to have been {{regarded}} {{at the time it was}} built very much as the residence of Mr. Vanderbilt is regarded in New York to-day. It stands on the edge of the hill on which most of the town is planted, so that, behind, it plunges down to a lower level, and, if you approach it on that side, as I did, to come round to the front of it you have to ascend a longish flight of steps. The back, of old, must have formed a portion of the city wall; at any rate it offers to view two big towers which Joanne says were formerly part of the defence of Bourges. From the lower level of which I speak--the square in front of the post-office--the palace of Jacques Coeur looks very big and strong and feudal; from the upper street, in front of it, it looks very handsome and delicate. To this street it presents two tiers and a considerable length of façade; and it has both within and without a great deal of curious and beautiful detail. Above the portal, in the stonework, are two <b>false</b> <b>windows,</b> in which two figures, a man and a woman, apparently household servants, are represented, in sculpture, as looking down into the street. The effect is homely, yet grotesque, and the figures are sufficiently living to make one commiserate them for having been condemned, in so dull a town, to spend several centuries at the window. They appear to be watching for the return of their master, who left his beautiful house one morning and never came back.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we develop}} a new TCP-aware link layer {{retransmission}} scheme that can offer almost full reliable transmission over wireless channels and efficiently avoid the adverse interaction of different layer protocols. We introduce time-stamp in our scheme to offer reliable delivery for out-of-order segment and use explicit retransmission notification (ERN) to avoid <b>false</b> <b>window</b> deflating and multiple retransmission of TCP source. By simulation, we conclude that our proposal can greatly improve TCP performance over wireless networks...|$|R
5|$|Executive {{producer}} R. W. Goodwin recalls {{being on}} {{location for the}} episode's opening scene, in which Detective Barbala is thrown from a window. The room used for the scene had two windows side-by-side, and one had been replaced with sugar glass for the stunt. When the <b>false</b> <b>window</b> was blown out to simulate someone being thrown through it, the crew found that the glass <b>window</b> beside the <b>false</b> one had also accidentally been blown out. The episode's key grip, Al Campbell, suggested that the next shot show Barbala's dog lying beside his body to explain the second window breaking.|$|R
50|$|Between 1990 and 1999, gay artist Scott Swoveland painted {{more than}} 500 scenes on the four-paneled Plexiglas front window once per week, portraying events, advertisements, tributes, and other scenes. Swoveland, {{who had been}} hired as a barback, {{was asked by the}} owner to paint the murals. His designs each took one full day to create. The Houston Police Department {{sometimes}} called in with complaints against his often suggestive designs. During the AIDS epidemic, Swoveland worked to create more jovial, upbeat memorials to combat the numerous deaths and memorial services within Houston's LGBT community. Other scenes on the outside walls portrayed Janis Joplin, a memorial to a former owner's German Shepherd, and a <b>false</b> <b>window</b> depicting the inside of the bar.|$|R

50|$|Within {{two years}} of their arrival the Shaw family had {{constructed}} a two storey addition to {{the south side of}} the ‘L’ shaped existing building and more than doubled their floor area. The front entrance, entrance hall, reception area and staircase were built. On the same floor reception rooms which later became classroom 1, the computer room, Friere room were added. Upstairs there were bedrooms which later became the assistant admin office, DEA office, the KDSC Director’s office, the boardroom, and assistant director’s office. These rooms are approximately one hundred and seventy five years old. The Shaw family had remodelled Kimmage House until it acquired its unique Tudor style with triangular gables, spiral turrets and tall chimneys and <b>false</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
50|$|The house used in {{exterior}} shots, which bears little {{relation to}} the interior layout of the Bradys' home, is located in Studio City, within the city limits of Los Angeles. According to a 1994 article in the Los Angeles Times, the San Fernando Valley house was built in 1959 and selected as the Brady residence because series creator Schwartz felt {{it looked like a}} home where an architect would live. A <b>false</b> <b>window</b> was attached to the front's A-frame section to give the illusion that it had two full stories. Contemporary establishing shots of the house were filmed with the owner's permission for the 1990 TV series The Bradys. The owner refused to allow Paramount to restore the property to its 1969 look for The Brady Bunch Movie in 1995, so a facade resembling the original home was built around an existing house.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} a Z 2 symmetric model of one scalar field Ï in (1, 1) dimension. The model {{is characterized by}} a continuous transition from a potential V(Ï) with two vacua to the vacuumless case. The model has kink and antikink solutions that minimize energy. Stability analysis is described by a SchrÃ¶dinger-like equation with a potential that transits from a volcano-shape with no vibrational states (in the case of vacuumless limit) to a smooth valley with one vibrational state. We are interested in the structure of two-bounce windows present in kinkâantikink scattering processes. The standard mechanism of CampbellâSchonfeldâWingate (CSW) requires the presence of one vibrational state for the occurrence of two-bounce windows. We report that the effect of increasing the separation of vacua from the potential V(Ï) has the consequence of trading some of the first two-bounce windows predicted by the CSW mechanism by <b>false</b> two-bounce <b>windows.</b> Another consequence is the appearance of <b>false</b> two-bounce <b>windows</b> of zero-order...|$|R

The ceilings of the overhangs on the street level were badly damaged but have since been repaired.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{original}} design, a massive three-tiered tower is {{topped by a}} bell-shaped, copper cupola. The first and second tiers (which were of equal width) are cubic in shape, with large, Georgian-style painted shutters covering a <b>false</b> <b>window</b> opening. The third stage is octagonal, with Palladian-shaped, closed, Georgian-style painted shutters covering false openings [...] At {{the bottom of the}} cupola, the guilloche-patterned cornice molding was repeated with the octagonal bell cupola surmounted by a lightning-rod spire with a large, copper ball finial. Further Georgian influence can be detected in {{the original}} design's twin chimneys, which featured cornice-like molding that matched the dentils elsewhere on the structure. Inside the tower, in the third tier below the cupola, a large copper bell was used to call citizens to the courthouse for public functions (only twenty-five years later, in 1862, the bell was donated to the Confederacy, and shipped to Georgia to be melted down).|$|R
500|$|... "Born Free" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel Cerone and {{executive}} producer Melissa Rosenberg, and was directed by Michael Cuesta. Cerone and Rosenberg have written two previous episodes each, while this episode marked Cuesta's fifth time returning as director. Guest stars in this episode include Geoff Pierson, C. S. Lee, Mark Pellegrino, Christian Camargo, Judith Scott and Scott Atkinson. Rudy's apartment was set in Miami, Florida, however filming took place in Long Beach, California. The apartment was a brown, triangular apartment condo, so the producers altered its appearance; a false brick wall was {{placed in front of}} the garage entrance and a door was created. The producers also concealed a narrow door of the garage entrance with a potted plant, and added <b>false</b> <b>window</b> panes to the windows, concealing the existing vertical blinds. The shipping yard shown in the episode was set in the Port of Miami, yet filming took place in a port dock at the Port of Los Angeles. The scene was filmed in San Pedro, California, in a waterfront lot of Harbor Boulevard.|$|R

5000|$|In plan, the façade and {{the width}} of the cathedral are 67 ft, and its length is 96.6 ft. The {{exterior}} surface is painted light blue-grey with white border. The western facade houses the bell tower at the center and measures approximately 40 ft. It is {{in the shape of a}} cupola. It has eight arched openings, each fitted with a bell. The dome is needle shaped and has a triple bar Orthodox cross. [...] The cupola is circumscribed by a balustrade. <b>False</b> <b>windows</b> are designed on top half of the tower. A round clock with Roman numerals and a pediment is fixed between the two 15-light <b>false</b> <b>windows</b> in the north, south, and west directions. A central double door provides entry into the vestibule or narthex of the cathedral in the lower floor of the bell tower, to the east of which is the nave. The cruciform plan of the cathedral is formed by the exterior walls which are extended arms to the west of the two chapels.|$|E
50|$|The main {{entrance}} to the building is situated {{at the corner of}} Bolshaya Sadovaya street and Khalturinsky alley. On both sides of the mansion there were placed <b>false</b> <b>windows,</b> decorated with stucco architraves. Above the corner portion rises a gazebo with a dome ― it is the composite core of the mansion. On the second floor there is a balcony with a balustrade. The facade is richly decorated with stucco: decorative vases in niches, Atlantes, caryatids, medallions, sea shells, garlands and floral ornament.|$|E
50|$|Features of Free Classic Queen Anne style {{architecture}} and Folk Victorian predominate the structure.

50|$|Dominating the {{north-western}} {{end wall}} of the foyer is a large <b>false</b> Gothic <b>window,</b> made from plaster with panels of reflective bronze paint imitating glass. This feature is repeated on the opposite wall, with the lower portion serving as the doorway {{at the top of}} the grand marble staircase. Decorative friezes run across the north-western end wall at above door height, and two small lanterns are attached on either side of its Gothic window. All other wall surfaces throughout the grand foyer are scored and painted to resemble travertine block work.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{believed}} to have been designed by Anthony Keck, who had designed a similar property at Iscoed in Carmarthenshire, Whitson House had many Nash-inspired additions including the unsupported cantilever stone spiral staircase in the hall, similar to that of Ffynone Mansion at Manordeifi in Pembrokeshire, with an arched door frame underneath and plasterwork known to have been used at other Nash houses. There were also <b>false</b> plaster <b>windows</b> added {{to the ends of the}} adjoining pavilions which were typical of John Nash. In the same year (1791), Nash was working on his design for Newport Bridge and The Lodge at Whitson Court is a typical Nash design.|$|R

He included the Blake family crest - a martlet surmounting a cap of maintenance - on a frieze in 22-carat gold leaf in the dining room. A new frontage was designed by the architect James Nesbit of Kelso. A feature of the new mansion was the creation of six <b>false</b> <b>windows</b> on the south elevation, which substantially improved the external appearance of the new building but avoided the burden of window tax.|$|E
