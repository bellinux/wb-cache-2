25|$|The only {{fact that}} can be adduced {{in support of the}} {{assertion}} that Grimm wished to deprive Rask of his claims to priority <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not expressly mention Rask's results in his second edition. But {{it was part of the}} plan of his work to refrain from all controversy or reference to the works of others. In his first edition, he expressly calls attention to Rask's essay, and praises it ungrudgingly. It is true that a certain bitterness of feeling afterwards sprang up between Grimm and Rask, but this may have well been Rask's fault, who, impatient of contradiction and irritable in controversy, refused to consider the value of Grimm's views when they called for the modification of his own.|$|E
25|$|Details of Timesitheus' {{policies}} and achievements as the (probable) de facto {{ruler of the}} Empire {{during the reign of}} his son-in-law are sparse. There is evidence of substantial road repairs undertaken {{in many parts of the}} Roman World which would have been of economic and strategic significance. Monuments were restored in major cities which might have lifted civilian morale as well as providing employment for sculptors, stonemasons etc. It also seems that there was a thoroughgoing adjustment of the African frontier. It is not possible to tell how far such measures reflected policy guidelines issued by Timesitheus' office to provincial authorities, still less what detailed planning was carried out there. The most that can be said with any confidence <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not seem to have stood in the way of functionaries, such as the procurator of Mauretania, who conceived and drove forward such works.|$|E

500|$|David McNaughton argues that, {{even if the}} agent's {{commitment}} to his/her principles is not undermined, two-level utilitarianism does not succeed in its goal of showing, [...] "how, on utilitarian principles, {{it is a good}} idea to think and reason in a pluralist and non-consequentialist manner." [...] It is impossible, he claims, to compartmentalise one's thinking in the way the two-level account requires—to simultaneously think like a utilitarian and act in a non-utilitarian way. Hare's response to this type of criticism <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> his own moral thinking in this way, therefore the challenge that this type of moral thinking is impossible must be false.|$|E
500|$|In January 2005, Ferguson and Wenger were {{embroiled in}} a new row over what had {{happened}} in the tunnel after Pizzagate. Ferguson alleged that Wenger called his players [...] "cheats" [...] and never apologised for his team's behaviour: [...] "It's a disgrace, but I don't expect Wenger to ever apologise, he's that type of person." [...] Wenger then claimed Ferguson was guilty of bringing the game into disrepute; he told reporters that he [...] "will never answer any questions any more about this man," [...] but went further to question the motive of the press: [...] "What I don't understand <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> what he wants and you are all at his feet." [...] Both managers came under pressure from the Metropolitan Police Service, then Sports Minister Richard Caborn and Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore {{to put an end to}} the bickering. Ferguson and Wenger agreed to tone down their words, in an attempt to defuse the rivalry. In later years, Ferguson said Arsenal's defeat [...] "scrambled Arsène’s brain" [...] and caused their relationship to breakdown for almost five years.|$|E

2500|$|Tarzan {{is a white}} European {{male who}} grows up with apes. According to [...] "Taking Tarzan Seriously" [...] by Marianna Torgovnick, Tarzan is {{confused}} with the social hierarchy {{that he is a}} part of. Unlike everyone else in his society, Tarzan {{is the only one who}} is not clearly part of any social group. All the other members of his world are not able to climb or decline socially because they are already part of a social hierarchy which is stagnant. Turgovnick writes that since Tarzan was raised as an ape, he thinks and acts like an ape. However, instinctively he is human and he resorts to being human when he is pushed to. The reason of his confusion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not understand what the typical white male is supposed to act like. His instincts eventually kick in when he is in the midst of this confusion, and he ends up dominating the jungle. In Tarzan, the jungle is a microcosm for the world in general in 1912 to the early 1930s. His climbing of the social hierarchy proves that the European white male is the most dominant of all races/sexes, no matter what the circumstance. Furthermore, Turgovnick writes that when Tarzan first meets Jane, she is slightly repulsed but also fascinated by his animal-like actions. As the story progresses, Tarzan surrenders his knife to Jane in an oddly chivalrous gesture, which makes Jane fall for Tarzan despite his odd circumstances. Turgovnick believes that this displays an instinctual, civilized chivalry that Burrough believes is common in white men.|$|E
