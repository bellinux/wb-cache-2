In The Thousand Orcs (2002), Drizzt and his friends encounter the powerful orc Obould Many-Arrows, who has employed frost giants to aid him in gaining control of the region. After a battle at the town of Shallows, Drizzt believes the other Companions of the Hall to have fallen in battle, and he sets off <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> to fight all orcs in vengeance.

5|$|In 1974, R.A. Powell raised two fisher kits for {{the purpose}} of {{performing}} scientific research. His primary interest was an attempt to measure the activity of fishers in order to determine how much food the animals required to function. He did this by running them through treadmill exercises that simulated activity in the wild. He compared this to their food intake and used the data to estimate daily food requirements. The research lasted for two years. After one year, one of the fishers died due to unknown causes. The second was released back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back on Cybertron, Bumblebee {{struggles to}} {{maintain}} control, particularly after Ratbat's plots to have Skywarp assassinate him during a memorial for the Lost Light (which was presumed destroyed during its launch). Prowl and Arcee foil the attempted murder thanks to Starscream, who sees no benefit to restarting the war, {{and begins to}} work with Bumblebee and Metalhawk {{to form a new}} united government for Cybertron. Though many Decepticons are provided with jobs and fall into line, Bombshell continues with mysterious experiments that result in Prowl, {{at the end of his}} tether and increasingly emotionally closed-off, executing him. Fortunately, Ironhide is able to prevent chaos by successfully petitioning to have the I/D chips installed in the Decepticons turned off, restoring a sense of equality. Ironhide then recruits the Dinobots to join him in venturing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> to searching for the missing Aerialbots, only to go missing themselves. It is while they are being searched for by the other Autobots, Decepticons and NAILs that something else is discovered instead: a Metrotitan has returned to Cybertron, and it dubs Starscream the destined leader of the Transformer race. Before Starscream can exploit this new standing to any great extent, Megatron makes a surprising return and is taken into custody, causing the Decepticons to riot in the streets. It turns out that Megatron has secretly been working with a small team of Decepticons within Iacon to perfect the combination process, and he creates a new, more-powerful Devastator out of the Constructicons and Prowl, who has been under the mind-control of the still-living Bombshell. Ironhide, the Dinobots and the Aerialbots—now Superion—make a triumphant return to take Devastator down, while Megatron himself is neutralized by a failsafe created by Wheeljack. In the chaos, however, Starscream kills Metalhawk and uses his death to secure his position as sole ruler of Iacon, casting the Autobots and Decepticons out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness.</b>|$|E
