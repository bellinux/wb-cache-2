5|$|Almost {{every nation}} has {{associated}} blood <b>drinking</b> <b>with</b> {{some kind of}} revenant or demon, {{or in some cases}} a deity. In India, for example, tales of vetālas, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the Baitāl Pacīsī; a prominent story in the Kathāsaritsāgara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. Piśāca, the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.|$|E
5|$|Bacon: A Love Story, A Salty Survey of Everybody's Favorite Meat is a 2009 non-fiction {{book about}} bacon, written by American writer Heather Lauer. Lauer started the blog Bacon Unwrapped {{and a social}} {{networking}} site about bacon in 2005, after the idea came to her while she was out <b>drinking</b> <b>with</b> her two brothers; her online success inspired her to write the book, which describes curing and cooking bacon, gives over 20 bacon recipes, and analyzes the impact of bacon on popular culture. The text is interspersed with facts about bacon and bacon-related quips from comedian Jim Gaffigan.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{tried to}} {{maintain}} a sophisticated household that combined hunting and <b>drinking</b> <b>with</b> cosmopolitan literary discussion and courtly values. Nonetheless, Henry's passion was for hunting, for which the court became famous. Henry {{had a number of}} preferred royal hunting lodges and apartments across his lands, and invested heavily in his royal castles, both for their practical utility as fortresses, and as symbols of royal power and prestige. The court was relatively formal in its style and language, possibly because Henry was attempting to compensate for his own sudden rise to power and relatively humble origins as the son of a count. He opposed the holding of tournaments, probably because of the security risk that such gatherings of armed knights posed in peacetime.|$|E

5|$|Since his {{participation}} in an FIA European road safety campaign, {{as part of his}} punishment after the collision at the 1997 European Grand Prix, Schumacher continued to support other campaigns, such as Make Roads Safe, which is led by the FIA Foundation and calls on G8 countries and the UN to recognise global road deaths as a major global health issue. In 2008, Schumacher was the figurehead of an advertising campaign by Bacardi to raise awareness about responsible <b>drinking,</b> <b>with</b> a focus on communicating an international message 'drinking and driving don't mix'. He featured in an advertising campaign for television, cinema and online media, supported by consumer engagements, public relations and digital media across the World.|$|E

5|$|Tales of the undead {{consuming}} {{the blood}} or flesh of living beings {{have been found}} in nearly every culture around the world for many centuries. Today we know these entities predominantly as vampires, but in ancient times, the term vampire did not exist; blood drinking and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the devil was considered synonymous with the vampire. Almost every nation has associated blood <b>drinking</b> <b>with</b> some kind of revenant or demon, from the ghouls of Arabia to the goddess Sekhmet of Egypt. Indeed, some of these legends could have given rise to the European folklore, though they are not strictly considered vampires by historians when using today's definitions.|$|E
5|$|Venables brought Gary Lineker {{back from}} Barcelona, and Stewart was {{selected}} to be Lineker's striker partner for the 1989–90 season, leaving Walsh on the bench. An injury to Stewart gave Walsh the chance to win back his first team place, and he marked {{his return to the}} first team with the winning goal in a 2–1 victory over rivals Arsenal, though failed to capitalise on this performance and again was dropped. Later in the season he had to be taken off at half-time against Wimbledon as he had a long night of <b>drinking</b> <b>with</b> George Best the previous night. He ended the campaign with three goals from 13 starts and 18 substitute appearances.|$|E
5|$|On either 10 or 11 June 323BC, Alexander died in {{the palace}} of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32. There are two {{different}} versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus, and spent the night and next day <b>drinking</b> <b>with</b> Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever, which worsened until {{he was unable to}} speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them. In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.|$|E

5|$|Smythe's {{first home}} was 51 McMillan Street, {{now known as}} Mutual Street, {{not far from the}} future site of Maple Leaf Gardens. He was the second of two {{children}} born to Mary and Albert. Conn had a sister, Mary, five years older, who died due to illness in 1903. The family was poor and moved several times during Smythe's youth, the size of lodgings depending on Albert Smythe's wages at the time. At one point, Albert and Conn moved to a house in Scarborough while Mary and Polly stayed on North Street. Conn's mother Mary died in 1906, and Smythe attributes his mother's <b>drinking</b> <b>with</b> making him a lifelong abstainer from alcohol. At age eleven Conn was christened {{and that was the first}} time that he insisted on Conn instead of his given name of Constantine. Albert and Conn became estranged after Albert began a new relationship with Jane Henderson. The two married in 1913 and had a daughter Moira.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the singer recalling {{memories}} from a hangover, including images of whiskey, a shoe in a chandelier, and her making out with a man flash on the screen, particularly getting a bottle of whiskey and drinking it with him. In the following scene, Lo is seen at a tea party with four other women and the waitresses, where they drink champagne amongst an array of cakes and cupcakes. As the video flashes white, it shows {{a glimpse of the}} other women's fantasies. Then, Lo becomes drunk, takes her shirt off, smears cake on her face, pours champagne on herself and starts to dance with her guests and the waitresses. In the following scene, she makes out with the man she was <b>drinking</b> <b>with.</b> The visual ends with the singer being at home while vomiting into a sink. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Lo in a dark room, with mascara dripping from her eyes while doing activities such as blowing bubble gum, eating melting ice cream, and smoking a cigarette.|$|E
5|$|Vladimir Kryuchkov, the KGB Chairman, {{had told}} Pavlov {{of the coup}} on 18 August, one day before it began. He was asked by Kryuchkov to meet his co-plotters at the Moscow Kremlin, where on 19 August, he and his co-conspirators {{appeared}} on live television and told the Soviet people that Gorbachev was indisposed. As the day wore on it soon became apparent that Pavlov had been drinking since he issued several contradictory orders and repeated himself. In retrospect {{he admitted that he}} had been <b>drinking</b> <b>with</b> his son the day before. On the same day, his fellow plotters decided to depose Pavlov, sending him to his dacha where his wife took care of him. As with all the others, Pavlov was arrested following the collapse of the coup. Shortly after Pavlov was hospitalised with hypertension whilst remaining in custody. He was released on bail in January 1993 and granted amnesty by the Russian State Duma in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Wragg {{agreed to}} Teach's demands, and a Mr. Marks and two pirates were given {{two days to}} collect the drugs. Teach moved his fleet, and the {{captured}} ships, to within {{about five or six}} leagues from land. Three days later a messenger, sent by Marks, returned to the fleet; Marks's boat had capsized and delayed their arrival in Charles Town. Teach granted a reprieve of two days, but still the party did not return. He then called a meeting of his fellow sailors and moved eight ships into the harbour, causing panic within the town. When Marks finally returned to the fleet, he explained what had happened. On his arrival he had presented the pirates' demands to the Governor and the drugs had been quickly gathered, but the two pirates sent to escort him had proved difficult to find; they had been busy <b>drinking</b> <b>with</b> friends and were finally discovered, drunk.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} St. Ambrose Hospital {{chief of staff}} Charlotte King (KaDee Strickland) hiding in a supply closet after being raped in her office. Alternative-medicine {{specialist}} Dr. Pete Wilder (Tim Daly) finds and examines her, diagnosing a broken wrist, eye socket and nose and a deep arm laceration, and admits her to the hospital. King lies to Wilder, telling {{him that she was}} injured in a mugging. Wilder calls the police; King attempts to contact her boyfriend, Dr. Cooper Freedman (Paul Adelstein), but cannot reach him because he is out <b>drinking</b> <b>with</b> Dr. Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone) and Dr. Sam Bennett (Taye Diggs). At the police station psychiatrist Sheldon Wallace (Brian Benben) interrogates Lee McHenry (Nicholas Brendon), who was found with blood on his clothes. After nurses photograph King's injuries, Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) realizes that King was raped and offers her a rape kit. During her pelvic examination, King refuses the rape kit and tells Montgomery not to tell anyone else about the rape. Freedman arrives with Shepherd and Bennett, and is surprised at the extent of King's injuries. During the CT scan, King and Shepherd bond over their shared drug addiction when King refuses pain medication. Shepherd admits drinking alcohol again, and King offers to take her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Shepherd sutures King's wounds, which causes King great pain; Freedman feels powerless, unable to protect her.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study aims to {{evaluate}} {{the effect of the}} pH of drinking water in the oral changes caused by cadmium poisoning. Material and method: Ninety male Wister rats were divided into the following six groups: A - 15 rats were given cadmium chloride solution (400 mg/L) in <b>drinking</b> water <b>with</b> a neutral pH (pH 7. 0); B - 15 rats received cadmium chloride solution (400 mg/L) in <b>drinking</b> water <b>with</b> an acidic pH (pH 5. 0); C - 15 rats were treated with a cadmium chloride solution (400 mg/L) in <b>drinking</b> water <b>with</b> a basic pH (pH 8. 0); D - 15 rats received <b>drinking</b> water <b>with</b> an acidic pH (pH 5. 0); E - 15 rats were given <b>drinking</b> water <b>with</b> a basic pH (pH 8. 0); F - 15 rats received water with a neutral pH (pH 7. 0). All animals were sacrificed six months after the beginning of the experiment. A biopsy of the buccal mucosa, tongue and salivary gland of each animal was taken for microscopic analysis. Result: No changes were observed in the buccal mucosa, tongue mucosa or salivary glands in any of the groups. Conclusion: Drinking water that contains a high concentration of cadmium with differing pH levels demonstrated no damage to the oral mucosa and salivary glands of male Wistar rats...|$|R
