25|$|The natural {{course of}} events after a primary {{triangulation}} is to construct a secondary triangulation with sides of a few miles, and then a tertiary triangulation at a parish level to show all significant details. Unfortunately this did not happen because the infilling <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> fifty years of topographic surveying, with maps already published on a county basis. Some of those maps had origins that were connected to the primary triangulation, and some did not. As a result, the county maps were only loosely tied to the principal triangulation and no {{attempt was made to}} revise them.|$|E
25|$|Although {{initially}} {{the masters of}} Azerbaijan and southern Dagestan only, the Safavids had, in fact, won the struggle for power in Persia which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> nearly a century between various dynasties and political forces following the fragmentation of the Kara Koyunlu and the Aq Qoyunlu. A year after his victory in Tabriz, Ismāil proclaimed most of Persia as his domain, and quickly conquered and unified Iran under his rule. Soon afterwards, the new Safavid Empire rapidly conquered regions, nations, and peoples in all directions, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, parts of Georgia, Mesopotamia (Iraq), Kuwait, Syria, Dagestan, large parts {{of what is now}} Afghanistan, parts of Turkmenistan, and large chunks of Anatolia, laying the foundation of its multi-ethnic character which would heavily influence the empire itself (most notably the Caucasus and its peoples).|$|E

The Ottoman 3rd Division left behind some 400 dead in front of the Auckland's position alone; although others have quoted totals of between 150 and 162 Ottoman dead. The New Zealanders captured great numbers of machine-guns (some with prismatic sights) including two Lewis guns. Their casualties numbered 175; three officers and twenty-nine other ranks killed, eleven officers and 132 other ranks wounded with the Auckland Regiment suffering eighty-nine of those casualties.|$|E

25|$|Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and his Chief of Staff John Harris {{were arrested}} {{at their homes}} at 6:15a.m. on December 9, 2008 by deputies of the United States Marshals Service {{on behalf of the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Blagojevich and Harris were each charged with one count of {{conspiracy}} to commit mail and wire fraud and one count of soliciting bribes. The case involved sweeping pay to play and influence peddling allegations, including the alleged solicitation of personal benefit in exchange for an appointment to the United States Senate as a replacement for Barack Obama, who had resigned after being elected President of the United States. United States Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald noted that there had been no evidence of wrongdoing by Obama. The cases are part of a broader federal investigation by Fitzgerald code-named Operation Board Games that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> three years in which 15 people have been charged by Fitzgerald.|$|E
25|$|Chiume later drew {{attention}} to long standing political differences between Banda and the younger generation of MCP leaders, some going back to Banda's return in 1959, although until shortly before the August 1964 crisis, Chiume publicly supported Banda enthusiastically. Chipembere rejected this claim, dating {{their opposition to the}} post- independence period when Banda's actions became intolerable to them. Banda claimed in September and October 1964 that the ex-ministers, particularly Chiume and Chipembere, had been plotting to remove him from office and that these plots <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> some time. This is unlikely in view of the ministers' lack of agreed objectives and the unplanned nature of their response. The conversion of Chiume from loyalty to Banda bordering on sycophancy at odds with several of his cabinet colleagues to leading cabinet opposition to Banda took place extraordinarily quickly in August 1964, and his actions in leading the opposition to Banda was the nearest thing there was to any concerted plot. Both Chipembere in September and Chirwa in October tried to resolve to the crisis through compromise rather than plotting.|$|E
25|$|The {{war with}} Spain and England <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> nearly twelve years {{and both sides}} had {{achieved}} little in their goals. The result of the intervention of Philip II in the religious war in France {{in support of the}} Catholic League, meant that the Spanish had established coastal garrisons along the French and Flemish coast by the 1580s. These bases had a huge strategic value because they allowed England to be threatened by the Spanish fleet and troops. Meanwhile, England also intervened in France, but in support of King Henry IV of France, by the Treaty of Greenwich. The Spaniards had captured Calais in 1596 which meant that an invasion of England could be more achievable. As a result, after desperate French demands to keep her from signing peace with Spain, the English signed the Triple Alliance with the Dutch republic and France. England had sent an armada the next year under the Earl of Essex and Charles Howard to Cadiz which was captured and sacked. An angered Philip soon after took into consideration the defence of the peninsula.|$|E

25|$|After the {{partition}} of Ireland into two states in the 1920s, the road system in Northern Ireland developed very differently from the road system in the Irish Free State (later the Republic of Ireland). A {{modified version of the}} British road numbering system was adopted. Numbered roads were initially divided into two classes, A roads and B roads, with motorways being added to the system from the 1960s. In the early 1920s, local authorities in Northern Ireland were given grants from the Roads Board which they used to build new roads and repair and maintain existing roads. The grants were also used to help reduce unemployment by providing work on the roads. Taxes raised through Motor Licence Duties were also used to fund roads. New roads, such as the Great Western Road between Belfast and Antrim were built in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The Newtownards Road in Belfast had 'heavy traffic' in 1935-6 and the design of a bypass (later the Sydenham bypass) was discussed in the Stormont parliament; discussions about the need for a bypass <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> ten years. The first motorway in the whole of Ireland, the M1, opened in 1962, fifteen years after plans for its construction were first discussed.|$|E
25|$|The tournament was a one-night tournament held on August 21, 2011 in Arena México, CMLL's main venue, and {{featured}} 16 Mini-Estrellas {{teaming up}} for the tournament for the first time. The tournament was part of CMLL's weekly Domingos Arena Mexico show, promoted as {{a celebration of the}} Mini-Estrella division's 19th anniversary, and spanned 9 matches in total including the final one on one match. To determine the team match-ups in the tournament a representative of each team entered a Battle royal where the order of elimination determined when the team would wrestle in the first round – the first two wrestlers eliminated would face off, then the next two and the next two, with the final two men in the ring facing off in the last of the opening round matches. The final two participants in the Battle Royal were Universito 2000 and Fantasy, who would compete in the last of the first round matches with their respective partners. Of the eight teams only two pairings featured an ongoing scripted feud or storyline, focusing on the developing feud between Aéreo and Pequeño Nitro and the long running rivalry between recently deposed CMLL World Mini-Estrellas Champion Bam Bam and the reigning Mexican National Lightweight Champion Pierrothito that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> several years. After four first round matches and two semi-finals the rivals Bam Bam and Pierrothito faced the team of Astral and Pequeño Violencia. While their opponents were {{on opposite sides of the}} Tecnico/Rudo divide the team was able to put their differences aside to prevent them having to put their mask (Astral) and their hair (Pequeño Violencia) as they defeated Bam Bam and Pierrothito, taking advantage of the friction between the longtime rivals. Bam Bam was forced to wager his hair and Pierrothito had to wager his mask in the Lucha de Apuestas match that followed immediately after their tag team loss. As is traditional in lucha libre the match was contested under best two-out-of-three falls between the two wrestlers. The two quickly split the first two falls between them, leaving the score tied for a third and final fall, which lasted much longer than the first two falls. In the third fall Pierrothito was able to defeat Bam Bam and celebrated in the ring while Bam Bam had all his hair shaved off as a result of the loss.|$|E
