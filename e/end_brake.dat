50|$|The {{first two}} battery {{locomotives}} supplied for the London Underground were manufactured by Hurst Nelson and Co Ltd, who were based in Motherwell. They were delivered in August 1905, and were {{used during the}} construction of the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway, where they were numbered 1B and 2B. The vehicles were 50.5 ft long, with a tube-gauge cab at both <b>ends.</b> <b>Braking</b> and electrical control equipment was housed in a compartment behind one of the cabs, and the central section was lower, housing the 80 batteries, arranged in two rows of 40 either side of a central divide, which also supported metal covers for the battery compartments. The batteries were supplied by Chloride Electrical Storage Company. Each locomotive weighed 55 tons, and could haul a 60-ton load at 7 km/h. They were not fitted with current collector shoes, as none of the rails were electrified during construction. Once their task was completed, they were moved by road to the Hampstead Railway.|$|R

40|$|Coefficient of {{friction}} {{is considered to}} be a system property. Unlike physical properties of a material, coefficient {{of friction}} is dependent on an entire system. Surface roughness, wear rate, temperature and velocity are some of the factors that influence the COF in a brake system. Due to these factors, current testing strategies fail to make an accurate prediction about the performance of a brake system in smaller scale. This paper explores how a small-scale tester correlates to a full scale dynamometer test when proper scaling strategies are utilized. Series of tests are carried out on non-asbestos organic, semi metallic and low steel using the Bruker’s Universal Mechanical Tester (UMT) TriboLab. Results are then compared to the Greening full-scale dual <b>ended</b> <b>brake</b> dynamometer (Horiba) using AK master standard procedure. Area based Scaling laws are applied as the approach to scale down the conditions of the full- scale dyno test for UMT test. As friction is a system property, dynamometer and UMT tests showed different results. However, performance (COF) for these tests between UMT and Dyno has the same general trend. Therefore, with more repetition on different friction material, it is possible to make more relevant and accurate predictions of performance...|$|R

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the prestigious 24 hours of Le Mans was again {{won by a}} Ford GT40 in 1969, as the 917s had gearbox {{troubles}} after leading for many hours.

Herrmann's 908 low drag coupé was fast on the straights, but near the race <b>end</b> the <b>brake</b> pads wore down, indicated by a light that was introduced with the 908s. The team gambled on not changing the pads, which allowed Ickx to pass under braking.|$|R

5000|$|Nash was {{positioning}} {{this new}} product for the emerging postwar market for [...] "personal use" [...] autos. These specific use vehicles were {{as a second}} car for women or an economical commuter car. The Metropolitan was also aimed at returning Nash to overseas markets. However, Mason and Nash management calculated {{that it would not}} be viable to build such a car from scratch in the U.S. because the tooling costs would have been prohibitive. The only cost-effective option was to build overseas using existing mechanical components (engine, transmission, rear <b>end,</b> suspension, <b>brakes,</b> electrical), leaving only the tooling cost for body panels and other unique components.|$|R
50|$|The {{front axle}} is stiff, {{suspended}} by transverse half-elliptic spring, {{carried by the}} aluminium engine block, while the rear axle consists of two independent swinging half-axles, suspended by a transverse half-elliptic spring, which is mounted {{on top of the}} differential box and leaning its <b>ends</b> against the <b>brake</b> plates.

40|$|Brake squeal {{has been}} a {{persistent}} quality issue for the automotive industry and brake suppliers. Large efforts {{have been made in}} order to understand squeal occurrences and ultimately to provide solutions for reducing it. However, due to the complex nature of brake squeal and wide frequency range in which it occurs, it is difficult to identify the possible sources of squeal excitation produced by a disc or drum brake assembly. It is, therefore, the attempt of this paper to observe the effect of external particles on the squeal noise of two different commercial brake pads. In doing so, a series of brake dynamometer tests will be conducted with at least 100 braking applications at various operating conditions for each brake pad. Two different types of external particles, namely road grit and silica sand with a size between 100 to 200 μm will be used and fed into the disc <b>brake</b> <b>end</b> corner. <b>Brake</b> squeal occurrences will be captured using accelerometers and a microphone. Those results will then be compared with the test results without external particles. The results shows that the squeal occurrence, the pressure, speed, temperature, and frequency level is decreased significantly with the presence of external grit particles...|$|R

40|$|The called {{vibratory}} instability squeal {{that appears}} in narrow curve or in <b>end</b> of <b>braking</b> is today uncontrolled and produced a high pitched noise very intense and unbearable. Many systems {{have been developed to}} limit acoustic emissions and particularly the metallic ring damping solution. Attenuation can reach 20 dB depending on the wheel type (Corail, safety wheel, etc.). However, the question is why this system has a various efficiency even on similar wheels and if this solution may be optimized. The aim {{of this paper is to}} understand the attenuation mechanisms of the ring dampers. Wheel modes susceptible to squeal are highlighted and numerical models are developed in order to simulate how the acoustic attenuation occur...|$|R

In the final phase of the race, the Ferraris pitted for the super-soft tyres, discovering the same graining problem as everyone else over longer stints. The distance between Button and Barrichello halved over the final few laps, though Button was deliberately slowing to avoid encountering backmarkers who were fighting for position. He won by seven-and-a-half seconds from Barrichello, with the Ferraris of Räikkönen and Massa third and fourth.|$|R

40|$|Objective of {{the present}} study was to analyze the {{effectiveness}} of countermeasures at bicycle crossroads during the driver–cyclist interaction by the use of a driving simulator. Three countermeasures were examined: baseline condition (absence of treatment), colored paved markings and raised island. Forty-two participants drove a suburban scenario with several bicycle crossroads having difference configurations and presence/absence of cyclist. 378 speed profiles were plotted from 150 m before each crossroads to obtain the explanatory variables of the driver behavior. A set of ANOVAs was used to analyze the driver behavior. Results showed that countermeasures affected in statistically significant way the distance at which the driver <b>ends</b> the <b>braking</b> maneuver, highlighting the better effectiveness of the colored pavement. A general improvement of the driver speed behavior was also observed for this counter-measure.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} an {{in-depth}} {{analysis of the}} properties of Gipps' car-following model. Certain properties of the model are investigated and the need of specific additions to the model is identified. Gipps' car-following model is rather important as it comprises the traffic model of several traffic simulation packages; and the analysis performed in this study determines the actual dynamics that govern model formulae. First, the relationships for the maximum acceleration and deceleration values the model produces are identified. Results indicate that model relationships are such that a vehicle could <b>end</b> up <b>braking</b> harder than its desired deceleration, hence a constraint has to be set. Furthermore, relationships between vehicle acceleration and speed are established. Second, further additions are proposed to allow the model simulate traffic at signal-controlled junctions. These additions include providing a definition for a queueing vehicle and speed manipulation to achieve the calculated saturation flow of simulated junctions...|$|R
