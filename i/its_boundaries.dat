5|$|A {{grove of}} {{enormous}} incense cedars exists near Diamond Lake, {{and there is}} a forest of ponderosa pine at the nearby Emile Big Tree Trail. The Umpqua National Forest features swordferns and Douglas firs. Rocky Mountain elks, pronghorns, and mule deer, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions live in the Fremont–Winema National Forest. The forest's rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass. The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, Canada geese, and whistling swans. Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also infrequently enter <b>its</b> <b>boundaries.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the American Revolutionary War {{began in}} the East, Kentucky's {{settlers}} became involved in a dispute about the region's sovereignty.

In June 1776, these settlers selected Clark and John Gabriel Jones to deliver a petition to the Virginia General Assembly, asking Virginia to formally extend <b>its</b> <b>boundaries</b> to include Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Central Area Command was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II.

Proposals in 1943–44 to raise a new Central Area Command did not come to fruition.|$|E

The command was formed in January 1942, following the outbreak of the Pacific War, from the western part of Northern Area Command, which had covered all of northern Australia and Papua. Headquartered at Darwin, North-Western Area Command was initially responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within <b>its</b> <b>boundaries.</b>|$|E

5|$|Also {{close to}} the 35thparallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the {{founding}} of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within <b>its</b> <b>boundaries</b> a small grassy section of the road. Interstate40, which crosses the park, replaced the older highway.|$|E

Later in 1926, the City of Coral Gables incorporated with Key Biscayne, which was included in <b>its</b> <b>boundaries.</b> There were dreams of a bridge to the island, making Key Biscayne the seaside resort for Coral Gables, as Miami Beach had become for Miami.|$|E

Throughout the war, the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh had been voicing their discontent over seventy years of Azeri rule {{and said that they}} were defending themselves from Azerbaijan's aggression. Their capture of the towns of Khojaly and Shusha stemmed from security concerns in silencing artillery bombardments positioned in those towns.
