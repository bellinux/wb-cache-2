5|$|Agricultural <b>improvement</b> <b>and</b> the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 was {{intended}} {{to make it easier}} for landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as a major source of employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{conveniently}} sited for passengers, Ramsgate Harbour station presented severe operating difficulties. Its {{situation at}} the end of a steep gradient in the tunnel meant there was the constant risk that an out-of-control train would run through the station onto the beach, as happened on 3August 1891 and 24March 1915. Cramped conditions allowed no room for station growth or <b>improvement,</b> <b>and</b> the small turntable meant larger engines could not be used, so heavier trains needed two engines to haul them up the tunnel's gradient. Additionally, by the 1920s the population of Ramsgate had almost doubled since the station had opened, making the freight facilities inadequate, with no room for expansion.|$|E

He began to show signs of <b>improvement</b> <b>and</b> maturity as the Canucks used him more in the 2007–08 season.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{strained}} {{relationship between}} Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted {{to work together}} again on extending Medicare to cover prescription drug benefits. Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400billion program as an opportunity {{that should not be}} missed. However, when the final formulation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, <b>Improvement,</b> <b>and</b> Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1988 {{publication}} of Roddy Doyle's novel The Commitments (1987) in the United Kingdom, producers Lynda Myles and Roger Randall-Cutler acquired the film rights, and asked Doyle {{to write a}} film adaptation. Doyle, an inexperienced screenwriter, spent one year drafting the script, accompanied by Myles and Randall-Cutler. Although a script was completed, Myles felt it needed <b>improvement,</b> <b>and</b> passed the book on to Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, hoping that they would suggest a more experienced writer. However, upon reading the novel, Clement and La Frenais agreed to help write the script themselves.|$|E

5|$|In the Georgian era, Norwich {{became an}} {{increasingly}} popular destination with travellers and {{developed into a}} fashionable shopping town. Buildings around the market were developed into luxury shops and coaching inns. The {{eastern side of the}} market was particularly fashionable and became known as Gentleman's Walk. The area around the market had become very congested by the 19thcentury, but the council was unable to raise funds for <b>improvement</b> <b>and</b> few alterations were made. Because many of the market's stalls were privately owned, the council was unable to rearrange the market into a more rational layout.|$|E

5|$|Scapa Flow {{provided}} the main anchorage for the British Grand Fleet {{throughout most of}} the First World War, but in the interwar period this passed to Rosyth, more conveniently located further south in the Firth of Forth.
