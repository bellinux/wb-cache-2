500|$|The Shadows (consisting of {{band members}} Brian Bennett, Hank Marvin, John Rostill and Bruce Welch) as Themselves, {{complementing}} Cliff Richard Jr in Alan Tracy's dream sequence set at The Swinging Star. Bennett remembers the puppet {{that was based}} on his likeness: [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to ask if I could keep him when filming was finished, but apparently he was to be turned into another character after the film had been finished." ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{arrived at}} that valiant resolution, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to lock and bolt {{the back and}} front doors, and see to the {{security}} of every shutter in the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to fall aff the flower-pot; but syne I came to, {{and says}} I, wi' a polite smirk, 'I'm {{thinking}} your leddyship,' says I, 'as you're the bonniest yourself.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> after Claxton was put down, I caused A Divine Looking-Glass to {{be printed}} anew in 1661." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an interview, Kardinal {{stated that}} he does not like the song, and [...] "it was the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that wasn't from the heart." ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> {{after we}} were left {{together}} alone, {{was to make a}} third attempt to get up from my seat on the sand. Mr. Franklin stopped me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I must {{be just as}} much {{to blame}} as you," [...] Walter replied, in a {{trembling}} voice. [...] "My business was to stand watch, and the very <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to go to sleep." ...|$|E
60|$|Upon these apprehensions, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to go quite {{out of my}} knowledge, and go {{by another}} name. This I did effectually, for I went into the Mint too, took lodgings in a very private place, dressed up {{in the habit of}} a widow, and called myself Mrs. Flanders.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Longdon {{turned from}} his contemplation with a visible effort. [...] "I {{feel obliged to}} you for taking it so; it mightn't--one never knows--have amused you. As I told you there, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to ask Fernanda about the company; and when she {{mentioned}} your name I immediately said: 'Would he like me to speak to him?'" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found out}} from the coachman, among other matters, {{that there was a}} famous fishing stream near Barkingham; and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> on {{arriving}} at the town, was to buy a rod and line.|$|R
6000|$|... "That’s me, ma’am," [...] {{said the}} gentleman mentioned, {{shaking his head}} despairingly. [...] "That’s Bill Brisket all over. I come blundering in, and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> is to blurt out secrets; then, when I try to smooth it over——" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see I've {{only been}} in here a couple of months. It was a pretty tough looking place when I came to it. But I've been getting <b>things</b> fixed. <b>First</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> put those two carboys in the window with the lights behind them. They show up fine, don't they?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hey! are {{you ever}} going to get up?" [...] some one yelled into my drowsy brain. I roused and opened my eyes. The yellow, {{flickering}} shadows on the wall of my tent told me that the sun had long risen. I found my companions finishing breakfast. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to look over the dogs. Shep, the black-and-white pup, was missing.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} I {{had taken it}} in, and then the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to spring up and ask how she could leave the boy still in the woman's power, to which she {{answered}} that she had walked them back to Spinney Lawn--a whole mile--and that Lady Hester could not set forth again, now that Alured had heard the conversation.|$|E
60|$|You see, the {{combination}} started this way. When I {{got up to}} Redding and had become a doctor, I looked {{around to see what}} my chances were for aiding in, the great work. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to determine what manner of doctor I was to be. Being a Connecticut farmer, I naturally consulted my farmacopia, and at once decided to become a farmeopath.|$|E
6000|$|... "I began 'em afore I {{was a day}} old. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in {{this life}} was to utter an 'orrible roar, and I obsarved that {{immediately}} I got a drink; so I roared agin, an' got another. Leastwise I've bin told that <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> an' if it wasn't obsarvation as caused me for to roar w'en I wanted a drink, wot wos it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Trust me, {{your honor}} One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> when the firing was over, was to pop into {{a stable and}} to get a big armful of hay; and take it out and hide it away, under a hedge. It was lucky I did; for the minute {{afterwards}} we could not have got a handful, if we had offered a Napoleon for it." ...|$|R
60|$|Neither {{was this}} all: but my goods being all English manufactures, such as cloths, stuffs, baize, and things {{particularly}} valuable and desirable in the country, I found means {{to sell them}} to a very great advantage; so that I might say, I had {{more than four times}} the value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the advancement of my plantation: for the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>I</b> bought me a Negro slave, and ail European servant also; I mean another besides that which the captain brought me from Lisbon.|$|R
6000|$|... "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> {{to put my}} {{head down}} {{the square of the}} midship ventilator. As I lifted the lid a visible breath, {{something}} like a thin fog, a puff of faint haze, rose from the opening. The ascending air was hot, and had a heavy, sooty, paraffiny smell. I gave one sniff, and put down the lid gently. It was no use choking myself. The cargo was on fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I didn't do it," [...] she continued, [...] "for there wasn't no {{soft water}} {{underneath}} {{for her to}} fall into. After we went to bed I kep' awake for a long time, bein' afraid she'd {{get up in the}} night an' turn on all the gases and smother me alive. But I fell asleep at last, an' when I woke up, early in the mornin', the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to feel for that lunertic. But she was gone!" ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>was</b> {{to dismiss}} my visitor, the Dutch captain, whom I {{had a great}} deal of reason to think myself {{exceedingly}} obliged to: and, first, I handsomely rewarded his men, to whom I gave four pieces of eight a man; and having waited on the captain to the ship's side, and seen him into his boat, I fired him twenty-one guns at his going off; for which he fired twenty-five when he came on board his ship.|$|E
60|$|May 1st. On getting indoors last night, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> after {{striking}} a light, {{was to take}} the ragged cravat off the candles, and smooth it out on the table. I then took the end that had been in poor Mary's hand out of my writing-desk, and smoothed that out too. It matched the torn side of the cravat exactly. I put them together, and satisfied myself that there was not a doubt of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I own a cart-horse, worth {{three of}} him!" [...] said the country fellow. [...] "If this pony were mine, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> {{would be to}} clip his wings!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, the stoves {{are the one}} <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> don't like in Russia. I like to see {{a blazing}} fire, and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> when <b>I</b> get into fresh quarters, is to have the stove opened so that I can see one. This is a second room of mine. There were three together, you see, and as my rank is that of a colonel, I was able to get them, and it is handy, if a friend comes to see me, to have a room for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} I ain't. He's {{written a letter}} to Lord Hampstead, who has always been my friend. Hampstead wasn't going to see me treated after that fashion. Hampstead wrote, and then Æolus wrote,--that's Sir Boreas,--and I've seen the letter,--that is, Hampstead told me what there is in it; and I ain't to be {{dismissed}} at all. When I heard the good news the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to come as fast as my legs would carry me, and tell the girl of my heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And he has {{the nicest}} little ears, Mrs. Doctor, dear," [...] said Susan. [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> {{to look at his}} ears. Hair is {{deceitful}} and noses and eyes change, and you cannot tell what is going to come of them, but ears is ears from start to finish, and you always know where you are with them. Just look at their shape--and they are set right back against his precious head. You will never need to be ashamed of his ears, Mrs. Doctor, dear." ...|$|E
60|$|For a {{long time}} an {{undefined}} feeling prevented me from going {{near the site of}} Nuflo's burnt lodge. I went there at last; and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to go all round the fatal spot, cautiously peering into the rank herbage, as if I feared a lurking serpent; and at length, at some distance from the blackened heap, I discovered a human skeleton, and knew it to be Nuflo's. In his day he had been a great armadillo-hunter, and these quaint carrion-eaters had no doubt revenged themselves by devouring his flesh when they found him dead--killed by the savages.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, that in {{two months}} I come of age. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> will be to open that door; the second, {{to get rid of}} the house." ...|$|R
5000|$|As a writer, Zailckas {{says her}} writing is {{informed}} by memoirists Mary Karr, Nick Flynn, Tobias Wolff, as well as novelists T.C. Boyle, Jeffrey Eugenides, A.M. Homes, Richard Ford, Haruki Murakami. She's also admitted she is heavily influenced by music and song lyrics. Zailckas has been quoted as saying, [...] "If you're a writer, there's a lot of inspiration {{to be found in}} lyrics. That's the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> before <b>I</b> get to work in the morning: {{have a cup of coffee}} and put on a record." ...|$|R
60|$|Neither {{was this}} all; for my goods being all English manufacture, such as cloths, stuffs, baize, and things {{particularly}} valuable and desirable in the country, I found means {{to sell them}} to a very great advantage; so that I might say I had {{more than four times}} the value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour—I mean in the advancement of my plantation; for the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>I</b> bought me a negro slave, and an European servant also—I mean another besides that which the captain brought me from Lisbon.|$|R
60|$|After the ambassadors were gone, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>was,</b> in the {{presence}} of all the company, and, having before had the opinion of those I brought with me, to tell my second mate how well we were all satisfied with his conduct, and to declare him captain of the ship that he was in; only demanding his solemn oath, to be under orders of the great ship, as admiral, and to carry on no separate interests from us; which he thankfully accepted, and, to give him his due, as faithfully performed, all the rest of our very long voyage, and through all our adventures.|$|E
60|$|The {{next time}} I shared Mr. Fairscribe's hospitable dinner, I failed {{not to return}} him due thanks for his kindness, which acknowledgment, indeed, I {{proportioned}} rather to the idea which I knew he entertained {{of the value of}} such things, than to the interest with which I myself regarded them. But the conversation turning on my family, who were old proprietors in the Upper Ward of Clydesdale, gradually excited some interest in my mind and when I retired to my solitary parlour, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to look for a pedigree or sort of history of the family or House of Croftangry, once of that Ilk, latterly of Glentanner. The discoveries which I made shall enrich the next chapter.|$|E
60|$|The day {{was filled}} with miserable variety. I had taken my dried clothes down from the galley the night before, and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to {{exchange}} the cook’s garments for them. I looked for my purse. In addition to some small change (and I have a good memory for such things), it had contained one hundred and eighty-five dollars in gold and paper. The purse I found, but its contents, {{with the exception of}} the small silver, had been abstracted. I spoke to the cook about it, when I went on deck to take up my duties in the galley, and though I had looked forward to a surly answer, I had not expected the belligerent harangue that I received.|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>do,</b> ma'am, is to {{telegraph}} to {{my agent}} in Edinburgh. He will arrange for the speediest possible hearing of our {{case in the}} Court of Session. Make your mind easy so far." ...|$|R
50|$|Henwood {{was born}} to Harold and Victorine Henwood in Teaneck, New Jersey {{and grew up in}} Westwood. He {{received}} a B.A. in English from Yale University in 1975. As a youth Henwood was acquainted with Marxism, but for a period late in high school into his early years at Yale, he identified as a conservative, briefly joining the Party of the Right:Sometime late in high school, I fell under the spell of Milton Friedman and Bill Buckley, and about the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when <b>I</b> got to college was join the Party of the Right (POR).|$|R
60|$|Five minutes {{afterwards}} my bonds were cut, I was hoisted on a man's back, carried {{up to the}} forecastle, {{and laid}} in a bunk on some sea-blankets; where the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was to lose my senses.|$|R
