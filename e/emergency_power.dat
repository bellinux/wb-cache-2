5|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{supplied}} by eight generators. Four were turbo-generators designed for naval use; these provided 1,250kilowatts each. The other four were diesel generators that supplied 850kilowatts each. Two smaller diesel generators—each provided 200kilowatts—supplied <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> should the main system be damaged. Total electrical output was 8,400kilowatts, {{not including the}} emergency generators, at 450volts on an alternating current.|$|E
5|$|While {{none of the}} {{affected}} counties or cities {{declared a state of}} emergency following the event, the Small Business Administration did approve a request by the Office of Emergency Services for a disaster declaration in late September. This formality paved the way for low interest loans for commercial or residential properties that suffered damage, but only about 50 claims were expected. Local authorities had trained for disasters on a regular basis, and the response to the light damage was considered smooth, though some officials sought room for improvement. Discussions followed the event, with local governments focusing on telecommunication problems, <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> systems, and seismic safety.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{residents}} across Guam {{were critical}} of the delayed response by the U.S. government; no aid had arrived within two days of the storm, but unsafe conditions at airports had prevented aircraft from landing. With the majority of homes destroyed across Guam, structures that remained standing were used as temporary shelter for those left homeless. Similarly, damaged military installations at Anderson Air Force Base were made available to all civilians. By November14, the USS Daniel I. Sultan arrived in Guam with 1,100troops to provide <b>emergency</b> <b>power.</b> A U.S. Air Force AC-130 landed on the island that day carrying the first package of relief supplies. About 400troops and 80public works employees were sent from Hawaii on November14. The Red Cross and civil defense offices were placed in charge of coordinating recovery efforts. Water distribution centers were set up across the island to provide residents with clean drinking water.|$|E

5|$|On 24 October 1958, Vulcan B.1 XA908 of No. 83 Squadron crashed east of Detroit, Michigan, USA. A {{complete}} {{electrical failure}} occurred at around , the backup system should have provided 20 minutes of <b>emergency</b> <b>power,</b> allowing XA908 to reach {{one of several}} airports in the area, however backup power only lasted three minutes due to a short circuit in the service busbar, locking the controls. XA908 went into a steep dive before crashing, leaving a 40-ft (13 m) crater in the ground, which was later excavated while retrieving wreckage. Despite extensive property damage, there were no ground fatalities, only one person on the ground was hospitalized. All six crew members were killed, including the co-pilot, who had ejected. The co-pilot's ejection seat was found in Lake St Clair, but his body was not recovered until the following spring. They were buried at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Trenton, Michigan, alongside 11 RAF student pilots killed during the Second World War in accidents at nearby Naval Air Station Grosse Ile.|$|E
5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines, and also providing electrical power {{on the ground or}} alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as ram air turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air into the RATs, which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls. In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit.|$|E

40|$|This article {{gives an}} account of late medieval {{theories}} and practices of <b>emergency</b> <b>powers.</b> More particularly, it examines the relation between <b>emergency</b> <b>powers</b> and constitutional change. It thus seeks to explain how, {{in the course of}} the 13 th and 14 th centuries, European rulers began using their <b>emergency</b> <b>powers</b> to gradually expand their fiscal and legislative competences at the expense of local authorities and the church. As is demonstrated in this article, it was essentially the normalization of <b>emergency</b> <b>powers</b> that made the transition towards a more centralized government possible. This can be explained by a combination of factors, including the government’s claim to an exclusive right to judge what constituted a public necessity, the new focus on prevention and preparation for future necessities, and the increasing identification of necessity with more general claims to ‘public utility’ and the ‘common welfare’...|$|R
50|$|They were {{emergency}} regulations {{passed on}} the outbreak of war and during it to give the government <b>emergency</b> <b>powers</b> to prosecute the war. Two Acts of Parliament were passed as enabling legislation to allow the Defence Regulations to be promulgated.

25|$|In August, {{during the}} annual audit of Beznau 2, the 50 kV <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> line was inactivated. Consequently, the diesel {{generator}} of Beznau 1 was switched on at low regime as prescribed {{by the security}} regulations. After the reconnection of the 50 kV line, the generator ran at higher load because of technical reasons, but it eventually failed due to a defective relay. It was therefore assumed that while the 50 kV line was not active the generator {{would not have been}} able to run at full loading. Since the unit 2 generator was also unavailable due to the planned audit, the <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> could be provided only by the hydroelectric plant or backup generators activated in case of flood. The decrease in redundancy caused a deviation from the normal operation parameters and was therefore classified as a level 1 event (Swiss scale level B).|$|E
