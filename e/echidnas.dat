5|$|Despite its {{dominance}} among ants, {{a number}} of animals are known to prey on meat ants. The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) is a prominent predator of the meat ant, mostly due to the high fat levels (up to 47%) in virgin queens. These queens can almost contain 47% fat, and when no queens are available after an attack, an echidna may stop attacking the nest. However, these ants are normally consumed either in low numbers or avoided entirely. Attacking <b>echidnas</b> burrow down into the hole they have made and consume them while handling the bites from the ants, as they frequently scratch themselves {{on the head and}} chest. The echidna does not consume meat ants throughout the whole year; instead, <b>echidnas</b> only attack meat ant nests from August to October, which is when nuptial flight (meaning that virgin queens and males emerge to mate) occurs. This time period makes it much easier for <b>echidnas</b> to prey on the winged females since they are directly above on the nest. Despite attacks, colony growth is not affected by <b>echidnas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Anteaters, aardvarks, pangolins, <b>echidnas</b> and numbats {{have special}} adaptations for {{living on a}} diet of ants. These adaptations include long, sticky tongues to capture ants and strong claws to break into ant nests. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) {{have been found to}} feed on ants. About 12%, 16%, and 4% of their faecal volume in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively, is {{composed}} of ants.|$|E
5|$|Amy {{continues}} to pursue Sonic, seeking out combat training {{so she can}} rival his abilities, and continues rescuing friends with the Freedom Fighters from Eggman and other antagonists. She joins Freedom Fighter subsidiaries—notably the Team Fighters, which includes supporting characters Antoine D'Coolette and Bunnie Rabbot and with whom she rescues Sally {{and a number of}} <b>echidnas</b> from Eggman and his army of robots. In the crossover spinoff series Trouble on Two Worlds, Amy battles Dr. Wily and other Mega Man antagonists with Sonic and Mega Man.|$|E
50|$|The <b>echidna</b> flea (Bradiopsylla <b>echidnae)</b> {{is thought}} to be the world's largest flea and it parasitises the short-beaked <b>echidna.</b> It reaches 4 millimetres in length.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Echidna's</b> {{family tree}} varies by author. The oldest {{genealogy}} relating to <b>Echidna,</b> Hesiod's Theogony (c. 8th - 7th century BC), is unclear on several points. According to Hesiod, <b>Echidna</b> {{was born to}} a [...] "she" [...] who was probably meant by Hesiod to be the sea goddess Ceto, making <b>Echidna's</b> likely father the sea god Phorcys; however the [...] "she" [...] might instead refer to the Oceanid Callirhoe, which would make Medusa's offspring Chrysaor the father of <b>Echidna.</b> The mythographer Pherecydes of Leros (5th century BC) has <b>Echidna</b> {{as the daughter of}} Phorcys, without naming a mother.|$|R
5|$|Mainly nocturnal M. nigriceps {{is found}} in hot hilly areas and woodland, nesting {{underground}} in mounds. The ant's diet consists of sweet liquids from flowering plants and invertebrate prey, which are fed to the carnivorous larvae. Spiders are known to eat these ants, and <b>echidnas</b> consume the larvae and pupae. Like other Myrmecia species, M. nigriceps ants possess a powerful and painful sting, and the venom is capable of inducing allergic reactions in sensitive people.|$|E
5|$|Mammals are amniotes, {{and most}} are viviparous, giving birth to live young. The {{exception}} to this are the egg-laying monotremes, the platypus and the <b>echidnas</b> of Australia. Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} predator is the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) that {{eats the}} virgin queens during nuptial flight {{due to their}} high percentage of fat. <b>Echidnas</b> do not consume Iridomyrmex ants all year; instead, they usually attack nests during August to October, which is when the winged females and males, known as alates emerge from their nest. Queens will also face more threats during nuptial flight or after; birds such as currawongs, magpies and ravens, attracted by recently excavated soil, will dig out nests shortly after the queens have founded their colonies. Parasitic flatworms in the class Cestoda are known to infect Iridomyrmex.|$|E
50|$|<b>ECHIDNA</b> is {{the name}} of the {{high-resolution}} neutron powder diffractometer. The instrument serves to determine the crystalline structures of materials using neutron radiation analogous to X-ray techniques. It is named after the Australian monotreme <b>echidna,</b> as the spiny peaks of the instrument looks like an <b>echidna.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other authors give <b>Echidna</b> other parents. According to the {{geographer}} Pausanias (2nd century AD), Epimenides (7th or 6th century BC) had <b>Echidna</b> as {{the daughter of}} the Oceanid Styx (goddess of the river Styx) and one Peiras (otherwise unknown to Pausanias), while according to the mythographer Apollodorus (1st or 2nd century AD), <b>Echidna</b> w{{as the daughter of}} Tartarus and Gaia. In one account, from the Orphic tradition, <b>Echidna</b> was the daughter of Phanes (the Orphic father of all gods).|$|R
50|$|The <b>echidna's</b> fur may be {{infested with}} what {{is said to be}} the world's largest flea, Bradiopsylla <b>echidnae,</b> which is about 4 mm long.|$|R
5|$|A queen will {{mate with}} one or more males, and during colony {{foundation}} she will hunt for food until the brood have fully developed. The life cycle of the ant from egg to adult takes several months. Myrmecia workers exhibit greater longevity in comparison to other ants, and workers are also able to reproduce with male ants. Myrmecia {{is one of the most}} primitive group of ants on earth, exhibiting differentiated behaviours from other ants. Workers are solitary hunters and do not lead other workers to food. Adults are omnivores that feed on sweet substances, but the larvae are carnivores that feed on captured prey. Very few predators eat these ants due to their sting, but their larvae are often consumed by blindsnakes and <b>echidnas,</b> and a number of parasites infect both adults and brood. Some species are also effective pollinators.|$|E
5|$|Living mammals {{are divided}} into the Yinotheria (platypus and <b>echidnas)</b> and Theriiformes (all other mammals). There are around 5450 species of mammal, {{depending}} on which authority is cited. In some classifications, extant mammals {{are divided into}} two subclasses: the Prototheria, that is, the order Monotremata; and the Theria, or the infraclasses Metatheria and Eutheria. The marsupials constitute the crown group of the Metatheria, and include all living metatherians {{as well as many}} extinct ones; the placentals are the crown group of the Eutheria. While mammal classification at the family level has been relatively stable, several contending classifications regarding the higher levels—subclass, infraclass and order, especially of the marsupials—appear in contemporaneous literature. Much of the changes reflect the advances of cladistic analysis and molecular genetics. Findings from molecular genetics, for example, have prompted adopting new groups, such as the Afrotheria, and abandoning traditional groups, such as the Insectivora.|$|E
5|$|Quolls {{are mostly}} carnivorous. The smaller quolls {{primarily}} eat insects, birds, frogs, lizards and fruit; the larger species eat birds, reptiles, and mammals, including <b>echidnas</b> and possums. The tiger quoll's diet {{is dominated by}} mammals such as brushtail possums, rabbits and hares. The exact mix is variable depending {{on the availability of}} prey after bushfires, and can include carrion or bandicoots when food is scarce. The other species of quoll have also been known to eat carrion. The paws and vibrissae of quolls allow them to reach into small burrows to find prey. Quolls hunt by stalking. Depending on the size of its prey, a quoll may leap or pounce on it. Quolls pin small prey down with their front paws while devouring it, and jump onto larger prey, sinking in their claws and closing their jaws around the neck. Quolls can obtain all the water they need from their food, making them quite adaptable during droughts or other periods of water shortage.|$|E
50|$|Gaia also mated with Tartarus {{to produce}} Typhon, whom <b>Echidna</b> married, {{producing}} several monstrous descendants. Their first three offspring were Orthus, Cerberus, and the Hydra. Next comes the Chimera (whose mother is unclear, either <b>Echidna</b> or the Hydra). Finally Orthus (his mate is unclear, either the Chimera or <b>Echidna)</b> produced two offspring the Sphinx and the Nemean Lion.|$|R

5000|$|The short-beaked <b>echidna</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by George Shaw in 1792. He named the species Myrmecophaga aculeata, {{thinking that it}} might be related to the giant anteater. Since Shaw first described the species, its name has undergone four revisions: from M. aculeata to Ornithorhynchus hystrix, <b>Echidna</b> hystrix, <b>Echidna</b> aculeata and finally, Tachyglossus aculeatus. The name Tachyglossus means [...] "quick tongue", in reference to the speed with which the <b>echidna</b> uses its tongue to catch ants and termites, and aculeatus means [...] "spiny" [...] or [...] "equipped with spines".|$|R
5|$|Upon its {{description}} in 1999, Ambondro was {{interpreted as a}} primitive relative of Tribosphenida (marsupials, placentals, and their extinct tribosphenic-toothed relatives). In 2001, however, an alternative suggestion was published that united it with the Cretaceous Australian Ausktribosphenos and the monotremes (the <b>echidnas,</b> the platypus, and their extinct relatives) into the clade Australosphenida, which would have acquired tribosphenic molars independently from marsupials and placentals. The Jurassic Argentinean Asfaltomylos and Henosferus and the Cretaceous Australian Bishops were later added to Australosphenida, and new work on wear in australosphenidan teeth has called into question whether these animals, including Ambondro, did have tribosphenic teeth. Other paleontologists have challenged this concept of Australosphenida, and instead proposed that Ambondro is not closely related to Ausktribosphenos plus monotremes, or that monotremes are not australosphenidans and that the remaining australosphenidans are related to placentals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Echidnas</b> do not {{tolerate}} extreme temperatures; they use caves and rock crevices to shelter from harsh weather conditions. <b>Echidnas</b> {{are found in}} forests and woodlands, hiding under vegetation, roots or piles of debris. They sometimes use the burrows of animals such as rabbits and wombats. Individual <b>echidnas</b> have large, mutually overlapping territories.|$|E
25|$|<b>Echidnas</b> evidently evolved between 20 and 50 {{million years}} ago, {{descending}} from a platypus-like monotreme. This ancestor was aquatic, but <b>echidnas</b> adapted {{to life on}} land.|$|E
50|$|Megalibgwilia is a genus of <b>echidna</b> {{known only}} from Australian fossils that {{incorporates}} the oldest known <b>echidna</b> species. It lived during the Pleistocene, becoming extinct about 50,000 years ago.|$|R
50|$|From {{the fifth}} century BC {{historian}} Herodotus, we learn of a creature who, though Herodotus does not name as <b>Echidna,</b> is called an <b>echidna</b> ("she-viper") and resembles the Hesiodic <b>Echidna</b> in several respects. She was half woman half snake, lived in a cave, and {{was known as a}} mother figure, in this case, as the progenitor of the Scythians (rather than of monsters).|$|R
50|$|No certain ancient {{depictions of}} <b>Echidna</b> survive. According to Pausanias, <b>Echidna</b> was depicted, along with Typhon, {{on the sixth}} century BC Doric-Ionic temple complex at Amyclae known as the throne of Apollo, {{designed}} by Bathycles of Magnesia. Pausanias identifies two standing figures on the left as <b>Echidna</b> and Typhon, with Tritons standing on the right, with no other details concerning these figures given.|$|R
25|$|<b>Echidnas</b> {{are very}} timid animals. When they feel {{endangered}} {{they attempt to}} bury themselves or if exposed they will curl into a ball, both methods using their spines to shield them. Strong front arms allow <b>echidnas</b> to continue to dig themselves in whilst holding fast against a predator attempting to remove them from the hole. Although they {{have a way to}} protect themselves, the <b>echidnas</b> still face many dangers. Some predators include wild cats, foxes, domestic dogs and goannas. Snakes pose as a large threat to the echidna species because they slither into their burrows and prey on the young spineless puggles. Some precautions that can be taken include keeping the environment clean by picking up litter and causing less pollution, planting vegetation for <b>echidnas</b> to use as shelter, supervising pets, reporting hurt <b>echidnas</b> or just leaving them undisturbed. Merely grabbing them may cause stress, and picking them up improperly may even result in injury.|$|E
25|$|Male <b>echidnas</b> have non-venomous spurs on the hind feet.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Echidna</b> was {{the mother}} of a huge brood of monsters, {{including}} other dragon-like creatures. According to Hesiod, <b>Echidna</b> gave birth to Cerberus, Orthrus, the Chimera, the Nemean lion, the Sphinx and the Hydra. (Other ancient authors, such as Hyginus, attribute even more monsters as children of <b>Echidna</b> such as the Caucasian eagle, the Crommyonian Sow, the Colchian dragon, the Harpies and Scylla.) ...|$|R
50|$|No. 8 is {{sometimes}} called the echidnahedron after an imagined similarity to the spiny anteater or <b>echidna.</b> This usage is independent of Kepler's description of his regular star polyhedra as his <b>echidnae.</b>|$|R
25|$|It is a {{challenge}} to study the <b>echidna</b> in their natural habitat and they show no interest in mating while in captivity. Therefore, no one has ever seen an <b>echidna</b> ejaculate. There have been previous attempts, trying to force the <b>echidna</b> to ejaculate through the use of electrically stimulated ejaculation in order to obtain semen samples but has only resulted in the penis swelling.|$|R
25|$|The {{final blow}} would come when Knuckles {{responded to a}} {{distress}} call from his people and arrived in Albion to find it deserted. This would be revealed to {{be the work of}} Thrash the Tasmanian Devil, whose people were mutated by ancient <b>Echidnas.</b> Thrash's actions led to almost all the remaining <b>Echidnas</b> being banished from Mobius, with Knuckles failing to rescue them. In reality, the disappearance of these characters-among others-was due to a lawsuit by Ken Penders.|$|E
25|$|Knuckles {{also appears}} in the Sonic the Hedgehog comic series in which other <b>echidnas</b> are also depicted; notable {{mentions}} include Julie-Su, Lien-Da, Kragok, Dimitri, & Lara-Su.|$|E
25|$|The <b>echidnas</b> {{are named}} after Echidna, a {{creature}} from Greek mythology who was half-woman, half-snake, as {{the animal was}} perceived to have qualities of both mammals and reptiles.|$|E
50|$|Sir David's long-beaked <b>echidna</b> (Zaglossus attenboroughi), {{also known}} as Attenborough's long-beaked <b>echidna</b> or the Cyclops long-beaked <b>echidna,</b> {{is one of the}} three species from the genus Zaglossus that occurs in New Guinea.
