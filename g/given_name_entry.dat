40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{family names}} in the former district of Brzeziny (284 villages, 3 towns: Brzeziny, Koluszki, Stryków); The study covered 94 200 na­mes, <b>giving</b> 5515 <b>name</b> <b>entries.</b> The material covers mainly the 19 th and the 20 th centuries. The analysis of morphological structure of the names shows the percentage and number of individual formatives in their productivity (cf. Tab. 1). The author has pointed out their occurrence and regularity and their onomastic connections with Wielkopolska, Mazowsze and partly Małopolska. The analysis shows {{that the process of}} suffix derivation is dominant here, both in forma derived from proper nouns and from consaon nouns. Basic forms constitute 27 % of all names (1494 names). The most common type of derived names is -ski. The formatives -ski, -cki and the expanded morpheme -in-//-yn-, -ew-//-ow-, -an make 1899 names i. e. 45. 9 * of derivatives. The derivations from apellative forms with the format­ive -ski (and the expanded morphemes) have been dominant in towns: Brzeziny (47. 3 %), Koluszki (51. 4 %), Stryków (52. 3 %), Jeżów (55. 16 %), Będków (43. 2 %), Ujazd (46. 7 %). There are 1203 nones with the basic -k- in the suffix (i. e. 3 o% of derived names). The derivatives with -ak, -ek, -lk//-yk, -сгук have been the most numerous in the study. Zadanie pt.

30|$|For {{comparative}} purposes, the 85 <b>name</b> <b>entries</b> {{were carefully}} transcribed by a phonetician. The number of transcriptions per <b>name</b> <b>entry</b> is varied from 1 to many (due to pronunciation differences {{associated with the}} distinct speech varieties), {{with an average of}} 3.89 per entry. Using these reference transcriptions and a word-bank grammar (i.e., a list of words with equal probability) of the 85 <b>name</b> <b>entries,</b> the baseline word accuracies of 91.67 % and 92.69 % are obtained on the speaker-independent test set of the spoken name database with CI and CD HMMs, respectively.|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{learning}} {{games have}} often limited flexibility to address individual {{needs of a}} learner. The concept gaming approach provides a frame for handling conceptual structures that are defined by a concept map. A single concept map {{can be used to}} create many alternative games and these can be chosen so that personal learning goals can be taken well into account. However, the workload of creating new concept maps and sharing them effectively seems to easily hinder adoption of concept gaming. We now propose a new semi-automated map generation method for concept gaming. Due to fast increase in the open access knowledge available in the Web, the articles of the Wikipedia encyclopedia were chosen to serve as a source for concept map generation. Based on a <b>given</b> <b>entry</b> <b>name</b> the proposed method produces hierarchical concept maps that can be freely explored and modified. Variants of this approach could be successfully implemented in the wide range of educational tasks. In addition, ideas for further development of concept gaming are proposed. Peer reviewe...|$|R

30|$|The {{database}} {{selected for}} this evaluation is a Motorola-internal American English name database which contains {{a mixture of}} both landline and wireless calls. The database consists of spoken proper names of variable length. These names are representational of a cross-section of the United States and predominantly include real-use names of European, South Asian, and East Asian origin. No {{effort was made to}} control the length of the average name utterance, and no bias was provided toward names with greater length. Most callers speak either Standard American English or Northern Inland English, though {{there are a number of}} other English speech varieties represented as well, including foreign-accented English (especially Chinese and Indian language accents). The database is divided into voice-tag creation and evaluation sets where the creation set has 85 <b>name</b> <b>entries</b> corresponding to 85 voice-tags, and each <b>name</b> <b>entry</b> comprises three samples spoken by a single speaker in different sessions. Thus the creation set is speaker-dependent. The purpose of designing a speaker-dependent creation set is that we expect that any given voice-tag will be created by a single user in real applications and not by multiple users. The evaluation set contains 684 utterances of the 85 <b>name</b> <b>entries.</b> Most speakers of a <b>name</b> <b>entry</b> in the evaluation set are different from the speaker of the same <b>name</b> <b>entry</b> in the creation set, though, due to name data limitations, a few speakers are the same for both sets. In general, however, our evaluation set is speaker-independent.|$|R

30|$|Assuming that {{a set of}} speaker-independent HMMs already {{resides in}} an {{embedded}} platform, it is natural to think of utilizing a phonetic representation (phoneme strings or lattices) created from sample utterances as the abstract representation of a voice-tag, that is, voice-to-phoneme conversion. The phonetic representation of a voice-tag can be stored as cheaply as storing a <b>name</b> <b>entry</b> with a phonetic transcription, {{and it can be}} readily used in conjunction with the <b>name</b> <b>entries</b> obtained via grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, as long as such a voice-tag is speaker-independent. Voice-to-phoneme conversion, then, enhances speech recognition capability in embedded platforms by greatly extending recognition coverage.|$|R
