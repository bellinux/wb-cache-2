5|$|As {{the train}} departs towards King's Cross, Rubeus Hagrid waves riders goodbye {{outside of the}} window. Shadows of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger can also been seen walking down the train corridor, looking for an empty compartment. Following this, Buckbeak flies outside the window, while Hogwarts {{can be seen in}} the background. Shortly after, the train enters a forest where centaurs are running. Upon exiting the forest, Hogwarts can be seen once again in the background. Fred and George Weasley appear, flying broomsticks and playing with fireworks. The Hogwarts Express then enters a tunnel, after which riders find {{themselves}} in the middle of a storm and pass Malfoy Manor. The journey then enters a second tunnel; Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear again in the train corridor. As a spider crawls up the compartment door, Ron eats it and the trio continue to walk on <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> After the tunnel the journey continues into London passing by an industrial factory and then a residential area. The Knight Bus then appears; squeezing between buildings and shrinking to pass under a bridge. As the bus drives away, the train enters King's Cross station, where Alastor Moody greets passengers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the various}} rooms, she meets men wearing vest tops with their faces painted white with black eyes {{staring at her}} as she passes <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being {{surrounded}} by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains a family of four mannequins in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal. A bare African-American is seen dancing and painting herself with a large brush while being almost naked. She is also seen with her legs spread around a TV screen and Beyoncé is seen on it, singing the song. During one scene, Beyoncé performs a dance choreography on a couch along with several other female dancers. Throughout the video, she is seen wearing a tuxedo with a tie, a white fur jacket and platform heels designed by Saint Laurent. The black-and-white jumpsuit she wears is designed by Russian designer Ulyana Sergeenko. Her look is further complete with dark make-up around the eyes and red lipstick while her hair is marcelled and blonde.|$|E
25|$|Toulouse {{lies on the}} Garonne, {{which runs}} into the city from the south-west, then turns and exits to the north-west. Just east of the Garonne, the smaller Hers-Mort (Hers) runs past the city from the {{south-east}} to the north-east, forming a narrow corridor. To attack the city from the north, Wellington's main force would have to cross to the east bank of the Garonne, then drive south-east <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> between the two rivers.|$|E

25|$|The {{investigation}} {{also indicated}} that the smoke and heat from the fire raced <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> and entered rooms where doors were left open. In addition, a window was left open, {{reducing the amount of}} smoke and toxic gas entering the chapel area and the lounge room thus preventing further fatalities. Investigators also cited the difficulty of moving elderly patients in wheelchairs to the nearby stairway and the inability of elderly patients of evacuating themselves from the third floor where the fire took place.|$|E
25|$|The area of Andrea Dorias hull where Stockholms bow {{penetrated}} encompassed five passenger decks. On {{the uppermost}} of these decks, the Upper Deck, {{at least eight}} first class cabins were destroyed. In all, six first class passengers lost their lives. In cabin 46, Colonel Walter Carlin {{had been in the}} bathroom brushing his teeth {{at the time of the}} collision and miraculously survived, while his wife Jeanette was killed. In direct line of Stockholms bow on the upper deck were cabins 52 and 54, which were occupied by Camille Cianfarra, a longtime foreign correspondent for The New York Times, his wife Jane, their eight-year-old daughter Joan and 14-year-old Linda Morgan, Jane's daughter from her previous marriage to American journalist Edward P. Morgan. Joan was killed instantly, while Camille died from severe injuries moments after the collision. Jane was seriously injured, but was rescued by some other passengers, among them Dr. Thure Peterson, who had been next door in cabin 56. He sustained only minor injuries, while his wife Martha was gravely wounded and was trapped along with Jane Cianfarra. After a long struggle to free her, largely on the part of her husband, Martha succumbed to her injuries a few hours after the collision. One deck below on the Foyer Deck, near the first class entrance, Ferdinand Melly Thieriot, circulation director of The San Francisco Chronicle, along with his wife Frances, were killed, as their suite was in direct line of the Stockholms bow. Their 13-year-old son Peter, who occupied a cabin further <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor,</b> survived.|$|E

The equally conservative college dismissed him after he deliberately provoked the college authorities. Smoking was forbidden, but he would smoke cigarillos in his office <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> from the president's. He annoyed his landlords by entertaining friends, including women, and was forced out of one house after [...] "wo stewdents found me sharing my meagre repast with the lady–gent impersonator in my privut apartments," [...] he told a friend.|$|E

500|$|There {{was little}} {{fighting}} on the ground during the day on August 20. However, US aircraft attacked North Korean positions around Taegu repeatedly during the day, often {{in close proximity to}} American ground forces. As night fell, North Korean troops launched a second attack, firing a barrage of 120–mm. mortar shells into the 27th Infantry's Heavy Weapons Company area at 17:00; several of their tanks also began advancing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> The US troops responded with artillery and mortar fire, hitting the North Korean column and its accompanying infantry. Waiting Americans held their small arms and machine gun fire until the North Koreans were within [...] of their positions. The combined fire of all the US weapons repulsed this attack.|$|E
500|$|The band's most {{experimental}} {{work during the}} sessions was channelled into the first song they attempted, [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows". Lennon sang his vocal for the song through the twin revolving speakers inside a Leslie cabinet, which was designed for use with a Hammond organ. The effect was employed throughout the initial take of the song but only {{during the second half}} of the remake. According to author Andy Babiuk, [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] marked the first time that a vocal was recorded with a microphone plugged into a Leslie speaker. Much of the backing track for the song consists of a series of prepared tape loops, an idea that originated from McCartney, who, influenced by the work of avant-garde artists such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, regularly experimented with magnetic tape and musique concrète techniques. The Beatles each prepared loops at home, and a selection of these sounds were then added to the musical backing of [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows". The process was carried out live, with multiple tape recorders running simultaneously, and some of the longer loops extending out of the control room and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b>|$|E
500|$|At around 08:00, a Soviet {{artillery}} barrage began. At 08:30, Rotmistrov radioed his tankers: [...] "Steel, Steel, Steel!", {{the order}} to commence the attack. Down off the west slopes, before Prokhorovka, came the massed armour of five tank brigades from the Soviet 18th and 29th Tank Corps of the 5th Guards Tank Army. The Soviet tanks advanced <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor,</b> carrying mounted infantrymen of the 9th Guards Airborne Division on the tanks. To the north and east, the 3rd SS Panzer Division was engaged by the Soviet 33rd Guards Rifle Corps. Tasked with flanking the Soviet defences around Prokhorovka, the unit first had to beat off a number of attacks before they could go over onto the offensive. Most of the division's tank losses occurred {{late in the afternoon}} as they advanced through mine fields against well-hidden Soviet anti-tank guns. Although the 3rd SS succeeded in reaching the Karteschewka-Prokhorovka road, their hold was tenuous and it cost the division half of its armour. The majority of German tank losses suffered at Prokhorovka occurred here. To the south, the Soviet 18th and 29th Tank Corps had been thrown back by the 1st SS Panzer Division. The 2nd SS Panzer Division also repelled attacks from the 2nd Tank Corps and the 2nd Guards Tank Corps. Luftwaffe local air superiority over the battlefield also contributed to the Soviet losses, partly due to the VVS being directed against the German units on the flanks of II SS Panzer Corps. By the end of the day, the Soviets had fallen back to their starting positions.|$|E

2500|$|Carpenter has {{described}} Halloween as: [...] "True crass exploitation. I {{decided to make}} a film I would love to have seen as a kid, full of cheap tricks like a haunted house at a fair where you walk <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> and things jump out at you." [...] The film has often been cited as an allegory on the virtue of sexual purity and the danger of casual sex, although Carpenter has explained that this was not his intent: [...] "It has been suggested that I was making some kind of moral statement. Believe me, I'm not. In Halloween, I viewed the characters as simply normal teenagers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tubridy met his wife, the {{producer}} Anne Marie Power at RTÉ in 1997 {{when he spotted}} her in a recording studio. He later spoke of the moment they met: [...] "She was going in to make a programme, I was going out. My head turned and my life changed. I pursued her relentlessly. She used to sashay <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> and I was quite taken by her. She was very erudite and she made documentaries on flamenco. She was much brighter than I am and continues to be, which isn't that hard really if you dig deep enough, and I asked her out." [...] The couple had a daughter, Ella, and later married in 2003. Tubridy proposed in the Abbeyglen Hotel (a [...] "favourite haunt" [...] of his) in Clifden, County Galway. The engagement was announced in The Irish Times with the words [...] "Ella Tubridy is delighted to announce the engagement of her parents Ryan and Anne Marie".|$|E
2500|$|Visitors to {{the museum}} are {{directed}} through a sequential series of rooms. Casey Kelly and Kristen Hoerl explain that [...] "the museum constructs an argument chain in which claims from previous rooms provide support for subsequent claims". The first room in the sequence contains a diorama of two paleontologists uncovering the skeletal remains of an indistinct creature. Two actors meant to represent the paleontologists are displayed on television screens mounted nearby; one explains that {{he believes that the}} creature died in a local flood millions of years earlier, while the other surmises that the creature died in the biblical Great Flood about 4,300 years earlier. This room is immediately followed by a second room of placards explaining various natural phenomena using two distinct [...] "starting points"—mainstream science and the biblical narrative, respectively. From here, visitors enter an L-shaped corridor that begins with mannequins representing the Old Testament prophets Moses, David, and Isaiah, while audio recordings of passages from the Book of Psalms are played nearby. Further <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor,</b> placards detail historical arguments against a literal interpretation of the Bible and conclude that [...] "The elevation of human reason above God's word is the essence of every attack on God's word." [...] The walls near the corridor's exit contain existentialist questions such as [...] "Am I alone?", and [...] "Why do I suffer?", paired with illustrations of human conflict and suffering.|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, 1963, Rose was in {{his office}} at Parkland Memorial Hospital across the {{corridor}} from Trauma Room 1 when he received word that Kennedy was pronounced dead. He walked across the corridor to the trauma room occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy and a priest who had been called in to administer last rites. There, Rose was met by Secret Service agent Roy Kellerman and Kennedy's personal physician George Burkley who told him that {{there was no time for}} an autopsy because Mrs. Kennedy would not leave Dallas without her husband's body which was to be delivered promptly to the airport. At the time of the assassination of Kennedy, the murder of a United States President was not covered by federal law. Rose objected, insisting that Texas law required him to perform a post-mortem examination prior to the removal of the body. A heated exchange ensued as he argued with Kennedy's aides. Kennedy's body was placed in a casket and, accompanied by Mrs. Kennedy, rolled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> on a gurney. Rose was reported to have stood in a hospital doorway, backed by a policeman, in an attempt to prevent the removal of the coffin. According to Robert Caro's , the President's aides [...] "had literally shoved [...] and the policeman aside to get out of the building." [...] In an interview with Journal of the American Medical Association, Rose stated that he stepped aside feeling that it was unwise to exacerbate the tension.|$|E
