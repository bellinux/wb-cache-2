The model yields metrics such as mean time to find a content and the load experienced by custodians {{as a function of the}} network topology. Using the model, we identify trade-offs between these two metrics, and numerically show how to find the optimal time to live of the random walks.

40|$|The host-to-host IP model {{currently}} {{supporting the}} Internet does not suffice in supporting current-day content {{distribution in the}} form of content-sharing via peer-to-peer applications, real-time media streaming and social networks. Since the design of IP, the usage of the Internet has changed from a messaging and few-to-few information sharing system to a fewto-many content distribution system where many users request large amounts of overlapping information. Running a content distribution network over a host-to-host network appears to be very inefficient since every piece of content needs to travel the complete distribution-chain from generator to consumer every time it is requested. The result is that identical pieces of information will often redundantly travel the same links and routers. Information Centric Networking tries to solve this problem by proposing route-by-name instead of route-by-address mechanisms. This enables networks to be optimized for contentdistribution instead of connections and allows routers to cache often requested pieces of content in memory. In this thesis we will attempt to solve problems that arise at the introduction of a new globally routeable network, enabling clients and networks to be a full member (both consumer and generator) on a global <b>Information</b> <b>Centric</b> <b>Network.</b> The topics discussed vary from dynamic end-user configuration and generating globally unique names in order to share information on the <b>Information</b> <b>Centric</b> <b>Network,</b> via mapping techniques to decrease routing complexity, to proposing a transition mechanism that dynamically creates IP encapsulating tunnels between disconnected Information Centric Networks.

In order for a new architecture to be globally deployed, it must ensure that existing applications will continue to operate, preferably without the need to even recompile them. As part of the Publish Subscribe Internet Routing Paradigm (PSIRP) project, we have explored the options for making existing applications based on the ubiquitous Sockets Application Programming Interface (API) compatible with the PSIRP prototype implementation, which is based on publish/subscribe principles throughout the protocol stack. We describe an emulator which mediates between the client/server socket calls and the publish/subscribe calls implemented by the PSIRP prototype.

One well-established approach of <b>information</b> <b>centric</b> <b>networks</b> is the Network of Information (NetInf) architecture, developed {{as part of the}} EU FP 7 project SAIL.
