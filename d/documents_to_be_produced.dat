40|$|When {{producing}} electronically stored information (ESI) {{in response}} to lawsuits, businesses face several security risks as well as legal requirements they must satisfy. Customized document management programs and e-discovery policies are key tools in protecting against inadvertent disclosure as well as meeting business and legal needs. T he amendments to the US Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP; www. uscourts. gov/rules/EDiscovery_w_Notes. pdf) that {{went into effect in}} 2006 place a substantial burden on nonlegal personnel {{to figure out how to}} implement legal holds for elec-tronically stored information (ESI). The FRCP rules require that organizations respond to law-suits by producing any relevant electronic in-formation stored on any media—in some cases, they must do so in the ESI’s native format. Legal holds must thus halt all deletions and revisions to responsive <b>documents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> in federal lawsuits in the US. European Union countries typically don’t comply with the US FRCP rules, but foreign companies that transact business in the US are required to comply with the FRCP rules when involved in US federal lawsuits, even while being careful to abide by the privacy laws within their own countries. Because documents related to lawsuits can be found on anything from hard drives to PDAs to CDs to smart phones and could be stored as electronic communications or even MP 3 s on many disparate devices, 1 businesses run increased risk of failing to provide the required documents {{in response to}} litigation.

The Court itself asked questions of some witnesses, almost always between the conclusion of cross-examination and the beginning of redirect examination. On one occasion, the ad hoc judge asked a question of an expert witness between direct and cross-examination; the Court and the parties agreed that the question would instead be submitted in written form to the joint panel of experts. Examinations were primarily conducted in English and French, with interpreters where necessary.
