40|$|Diesel exhaust {{particulates}} matter (DEPM) is {{a compound}} mixture of gases and fine particles that {{contains more than}} 40 toxic air pollutants including benzene, formaldehyde, and nitrogen oxides. Exposure of DEPM to human lung airway during respiratory inhalation causes severe health hazards like diverse pulmonary diseases. This paper studies the DEPM transport and deposition in upper 17 -generation of <b>digital</b> <b>lung</b> airways. The Euler-Lagrange approach is used to solve the continuum and disperse phases of the calculation. Lagrangian based Discrete Phase Model (DPM) is used to investigate the DEPM nanoparticle dispersion and deposition in the current anatomical model. The effects of size specific monodispersed particles on deposition are extensively investigated during resting condition. The numerical results illustrate that Brownian diffusion is the dominant mechanism for smaller diameter particles. The present 17 -generation bifurcation model also depicts different deposition hot spot for various diameter particles which could advance {{the understanding of the}} therapeutic drug delivery system to the specific position of the respiratory airways...|$|E
40|$|Abstract E–education or {{electronically}} transferred {{continuous education}} in pathology is one major application of virtual microscopy. The basic conditions and properties of acoustic and visual information transfer, {{of teaching and}} learning processes, as well as of knowledge and competence, influence its implementation to a high degree. Educational programs and structures can be judged by access to the basic conditions, by description of the teaching resources, methods, and its program, as well as by identification of competences, and development of an appropriate evaluation system. Classic teaching and learning methods present a constant, usually non-reversible information flow. They are subject to personal circumstances of both teacher and student. The methods of information presentation need to be distinguished between static and dynamic, between acoustic and visual ones. Electronic tools in education include local manually assisted tools (language assistants, computer-assisted design, etc.), local passive tools (slides, movies, sounds, music), open access tools (internet), and specific tools such as Webinars. From the medical point of view information content can be divided into constant (gross and microscopic anatomy) and variable (disease related) items. Most open access available medical courses teach constant information such as anatomy or physiology. Mandatory teaching resources are image archives with user–controlled navigation and labelling, student–oriented user manuals, discussion forums, and expert consultation. A classic undergraduate electronic educational system is WebMic which presents with histology lectures. An example designed for postgraduate teaching is the <b>digital</b> <b>lung</b> pathology system. It includes a description of diagnostic and therapeutic features of 60 rare and common lung diseases, partly in multimedia presentation. Combining multimedia features with the organization structures of a virtual pathology institution will result in a virtual pathology education institution (VPEI), which can develop to a partly automated distant learning faculty in medicine. </p...|$|E

40|$|Several {{technological}} enhancements {{have been}} made to METI's commercial Emergency Care Simulator (ECS) with regard to how microgravity affects human physiology. The ECS uses both a software-only lung simulation, and an integrated mannequin lung that uses a physical lung bag for creating chest excursions, and a <b>digital</b> simulation of <b>lung</b> mechanics and gas exchange. METI s patient simulators incorporate models of human physiology that simulate lung and chest wall mechanics, as well as pulmonary gas exchange. Microgravity affects how O 2 and CO 2 are exchanged in the lungs. Procedures were also developed to take into affect the Glasgow Coma Scale for determining levels of consciousness by varying the ECS eye-blinking function to partially indicate the level of consciousness of the patient. In addition, the ECS was modified to provide various levels of pulses from weak and thready to hyper-dynamic to assist in assessing patient conditions from the femoral, carotid, brachial, and pedal pulse locations...|$|R
40|$|On a daily basis, {{large amounts}} of medical images are {{acquired}} using 2 D acquisition imaging systems (e. g., vertebra and <b>lung</b> <b>digital</b> X rays, mammography). Moreover, {{it is possible to}} compress temporal sequences (i. e. 2 D+t), volume sequences (i. e. 3 D) or even spatio-temporal sequences (i. e. 3 D+t) by encoding each image separately and independently of all others (i. e. in clinical routine, physicians do not always keep all images but instead select the most relevant and accurate ones). Thus, 2 D compression is widely applied to medical images. It is also included in the DICOM format (described in Chapter 4), within various PACS. This chapter is a review of some basic 2 D compression methods which are frequently applied to medical images. Although, the common compression techniques and the traditional standards of compression do apply to medical images, some specific methods applied to specific images have been specially developed in order to optimize both the compression rates {{and the quality of the}} re-constructed image...|$|R

A 56 -year-old man presents to the emergency department (ED) complaining of blood-tinged sputum. The patient reports a 15 -lb weight loss and productive cough with foul-smelling sputum over the last 2 months. He has had subjective fever and has awakened almost every night drenched in sweat. He drinks 10 beers every day. On physical examination, the patient has a blood pressure of 134 / 92 mm Hg, heart rate of 102 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min, and temperature of 100 °F. The patient has gingivitis and <b>digital</b> clubbing, and <b>lung</b> examination reveals coarse inspiratory crackles predominantly in the lower lobe of the right lung.

Usually finger metastases present with swelling, warmth and dull pain that becomes throbbing whit time. Because of the rarity of acrometastases, especially as the presenting lesion, they are often misdiagnosed as a benign condition. Amputation of the involved finger {{is by far the}} most frequent surgical methodology. Unfortunately, at this time, the primary tumor has invariably spread to diffusely involve other organs and usually patients' survival is only few months. Management should be targeted to patient’s comfort, prevention of infections, and maintenance of function. In this report we present a case of a 66 -years old caucasian male in which initial sign of a lung adenocarcinoma was metastasis to the fourth toe. The patient was affected by non-insulin dependent diabetes and had a 3 -months history of “infection” in the fingernail. The lesion was managed for 8 weeks as a diabetic ulcer. Finger metastasis is associated with poor prognosis and, due to the scarcity of cases, no standard management protocol exists.

40|$|Systemic {{sclerosis}} (SSc) is a rare, multisystem disease {{showing a}} large individual variability in disease progression and prognosis. In the present study, we assess survival, causes of death, and {{risk factors of}} mortality in a large series of Spanish SSc patients. Consecutive SSc patients fulfilling criteria of the classification by LeRoy were recruited in the survey. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional-hazards models were used to analyze survival and to identify predictors of mortality. Among 879 consecutive patients, 138 (15. 7 %) deaths were registered. Seventy-six out of 138 (55 %) deceased patients were due to causes attributed to SSc, and pulmonary hypertension (PH) was the leading cause in 23 (16. 6 %) patients. Survival rates were 96 %, 93 %, 83 %, and 73 % at 5, 10, 20, and 30 {{years after the first}} symptom, respectively. Survival rates for diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) and limited cutaneous SSc were 91 %, 86 %, 64 %, and 39 %; and 97 %, 95 %, 85 %, and 81 % at 5, 10, 20, and 30 years, respectively (log-rank: 67. 63, P <  0. 0001).

In a multivariate analysis, older age at disease onset, dcSSc, ILD, PH, and SRC were independent risk factors for mortality. In the present study involving a large cohort of SSc patients, a high prevalence of disease-related causes of death was demonstrated.
