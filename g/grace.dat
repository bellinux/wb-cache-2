5|$|The final leg of Gloucestershire's {{northern}} {{tour was}} at Trent Bridge where they played Nottinghamshire from Thursday, 1 August, to Saturday, 3 August. This match was drawn after rain intervened. Gloucestershire scored 165 (<b>Grace</b> 9) and 253 (<b>Grace</b> 116). Nottinghamshire scored 258 (<b>Grace</b> 2–91) and 10 for 1 (<b>Grace</b> (1–2). So <b>Grace</b> finally {{made his first}} (and only) century of the 1878 season, surprisingly against arguably the strongest bowling attack in the country.|$|E
5|$|The first match began under a {{cloud of}} Grace-inspired {{controversy}} on Thursday, 20 June at The Oval, where Gloucestershire were beaten by 16 runs. Surrey made 150 (<b>Grace</b> 4–43) and 136 (<b>Grace</b> 6–70), but Gloucestershire's response was 111 (<b>Grace</b> 40) and 159 (<b>Grace</b> 31). This was a fine all-round performance by <b>Grace,</b> though {{he would not have}} been happy with two more innings under 50, and it serves to illustrate just how much Gloucestershire depended on him. The next match at Hove began the following Monday, 24 June, and Gloucestershire won by an innings and 67 runs after losing the toss and being asked to field. Sussex were all out for 93 (<b>Grace</b> 0–21) and 71 (<b>Grace</b> 4–13); in between, Gloucestershire made 231 despite <b>Grace</b> scoring a duck. His brothers did the batting in this one, Fred scoring 71 and E. M. 53.|$|E

MCC won the toss, batted first and totalled 93, half of which were scored by <b>Grace</b> himself with 47. England reached 75–6 at the close and were all out for 115 on Tuesday morning, but MCC were then dismissed for only 58, <b>Grace</b> having been first out for 1. Nevertheless, England struggled to complete their victory and lost 7 wickets in scoring the necessary 37 runs. In cold, damp conditions it was therefore a bowlers' match. <b>Grace</b> was dismissed in both innings by Tom Emmett, who was well supported by Billy Midwinter and Alex Watson. The MCC attack was led by Alfred Shaw, who took 10 wickets. <b>Grace</b> bowled in the first innings only and returned figures of 3–43.
