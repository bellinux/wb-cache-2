5|$|According to the English {{officers}} of arms <b>John</b> <b>Martin</b> Robinson and Thomas Woodcock, crests {{have played a}} relatively insignificant role in Scottish heraldry when compared to English heraldry. In consequence many Scottish armigers, including clan chiefs, have comparatively similar crests to one another. Because of this, crest badges can sometimes show an obvious association with another clan. For example, clans associated with the Chattan Confederation share very similar crest badges bearing wild cats. Clans associated with Clan MacTavish Clan Campbell of Breadalbane, Clan MacIver and Clan Campbell use a crest badges which contain similar crests and mottoes that allude {{to that of the}} chief of Clan MacTavish.|$|E
5|$|His {{mother gave}} Scripps £200 to go {{overseas}} after his arrest. To avoid recapture, {{he used the}} birth certificate of another inmate, Simon James Davis, to get a passport in Davis' name. Within a month of his escape, he turned up in Mexico as <b>John</b> <b>Martin.</b> He reported to the British Embassy there {{that he had lost}} his passport, and managed to get a replacement. Martin arrived in Singapore from San Francisco at about 2a.m. SST on 8 March 1995 (6p.m. UTC on 7 March).|$|E
5|$|<b>John</b> <b>Martin</b> Scripps {{was born}} in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, 9 December 1959 to Leonard and Jean Scripps, an East End lorry driver and a Fleet Street barmaid respectively. He {{travelled}} often in childhood, occasionally accompanied by his father, with whom he was very close. Leonard Scripps committed suicide when his son was nine. After his father's death, Scripps developed problems with reading and writing, which led to him leaving school {{at the age of}} 15. After dropping out of school he continued to travel, raising money for his trips by doing odd jobs and selling antiques.|$|E

5|$|The {{design has}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Architectural historian David Watkin described {{the house as}} 'large, irregular and rather featureless' and of a 'dull design'. On the other hand, historian, archivist and Maltravers Herald Extraordinary <b>John</b> <b>Martin</b> Robinson, in The architecture of Northern England, noted the 'complex building history' of the hall, describing it as a 'substantial and elegant Georgian house'. In his early 19th century work 'Views of the Seats, Mansions, Castles, Etc. of Noblemen and Gentlemen of England, Scotland and Ireland', John Preston Neale noted that the house is 'large and handsome'.|$|E
5|$|When it {{was shown}} at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1825, it {{attracted}} near-universal praise from critics for its technical excellence, its fusion of the styles of different schools of painting, and its subject matter. Nevertheless, it failed to find a buyer at the Summer Exhibition, and was instead bought by fellow artist <b>John</b> <b>Martin.</b> The painting proved too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold {{it on to the}} Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the National Gallery of Scotland, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|Worst {{affected}} was German Samoa, {{today the}} independent state of Samoa, {{which had been}} occupied by New Zealand in 1914. A crippling 90% {{of the population was}} infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children died. By contrast, the flu was kept away from American Samoa when Governor <b>John</b> <b>Martin</b> Poyer imposed a blockade. In New Zealand itself, 8,573 deaths were attributed to the 1918 pandemic influenza, resulting in a total population fatality rate of 0.74%. In Ireland, the Spanish Flu accounted for 10% of the total deaths in 1918 which can be seen as quite detrimental considering World War 1 was still occurring.|$|E

5|$|A {{brand new}} production, notable {{for not being}} {{a replica of the}} {{original}} Broadway staging, opened at the City Theatre in Helsinki, Finland on August 26, 2010 after a preview performance took place on August 24.

5|$|Stuart {{dropped down}} into non-League {{football}} with now defunct Hornchurch of the Conference South. He made fourteen {{appearances in the}} Conference South and seventeen in all competitions for Hornchurch, before a financial crisis at the club in November 2004 forced a number of players, including Stuart, to leave. He joined Grays Athletic, alongside Steve West and Lee Matthews, later being joined by former Hornchurch teammates Ashley Bayes, and <b>John</b> <b>Martin.</b> Stuart {{went on to win}} the Conference South and FA Trophy double with Grays that season, making 23 appearances in the league. The follow season, 2005–06 season, he made 34 appearances in the Conference National, reaching the play-offs finishing 3rd place, to be knocked out by Halifax Town 5–4 on aggregate. He also helped Grays Athletic retain the FA Trophy, defeating Woking 2–0 at Upton Park in the final.|$|E
5|$|The group {{sold the}} Holly mill in 1872 to W. H. and F. S. Hinkle and {{purchased}} the Galaxy mill from W. P. Ankeny. In 1873 Fletcher and Loring also became principal {{owners of the}} Minnetonka Mills Company near Lake Minnetonka, in production between 1881 and 1886. Loring supervised his milling interests until 1880, when his son A. C. Loring took responsibility for their management. The Northwestern Consolidated Milling Company led by <b>John</b> <b>Martin</b> purchased the Galaxy mill and beginning in 1891 operated nine mills in Minneapolis. By the early 1900s and until the Great Depression, Washburn-Crosby which became General Mills, Pillsbury-Washburn, and Northwestern which became part of Standard Milling Company were an oligopoly, holding 97% of the Minneapolis flour market.|$|E

5|$|While {{traveling}} in Mexico, Scripps met María Pilar Arellanos, of Cancún, and married her in 1980. They travelled together {{for two years}} until 1982, when {{he was sentenced to}} a three-year jail term for theft, burglary and resisting arrest. His imprisonment upset María, and their relationship was further soured when he ran away from jail during home leave in June 1985—just months short of completing his term—and burgled again. He was sentenced to another three years' imprisonment, during which she filed for divorce and married Police Constable Ken Cold, an officer in the Royal Protection Squad. This angered Scripps, who acted in revenge, stealing some of Cold's clothing while released on home leave. He was appeased only when she divorced her new husband and returned to her hometown. After he was released, Scripps legally changed his name to <b>John</b> <b>Martin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Logan {{remained}} the Military Administrator and British representative to Samoa {{until the end}} of the war. At the time of its seizure, Samoa was politically stable and its economy was based on its plantations which were mainly German owned. Apart from replacing most of the key officials, who were Germans, with New Zealanders, he largely followed existing policies but over time made a series of misjudgements. The German-owned plantations were allowed to continue to operate but only to trade with neutral or Allied countries. By 1916, most of the larger plantations were seized and placed into receivership when it was discovered that they were still trading with German companies. This placed considerable financial stress on the economy. Not long into Logan's administration, an uprising of Chinese labourers, who complained about their rations, had to be suppressed. He continued to restrict their civil liberties and over time most were repatriated back to China. By not implementing quarantine procedures, he significantly mishandled the arrival of the influenza pandemic in November 1918, which resulted in over 7,500 deaths. This represented over 20% of Samoa's population at the time. In the meantime, neighbouring American Samoa was quarantined by its Governor, <b>John</b> <b>Martin</b> Poyer, and consequently had no influenza deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the squad that performed so well {{in the second half}} of the club's 2008–09 campaign were retained, with very little transfer activity in comparison to previous seasons under Westley. Steve Morison, the club's top goalscorer for the past three seasons, moved to Millwall for a fee of £130,000, while both <b>John</b> <b>Martin</b> and Calum Willock were released by Westley in late May 2009. Midfielder Gary Mills was the last departure of the close season; rejecting a contract and instead opting to join fellow Conference Premier rivals Mansfield Town. Five players joined the club during the close season. Charlie Griffin was the first signing of the season, joining Stevenage from Salisbury City on a free transfer. Yemi Odubade, Chris Beardsley, and Joel Byrom signed for the club shortly after; the latter commanding a transfer fee of £15,000. Westley had previously managed Beardsley at Rushden & Diamonds and Kettering Town. The last signing of pre-season was Stacy Long; who joined the club on a free transfer from Ebbsfleet United. No players departed the club during the season, with Tim Sills the only addition – signing for an undisclosed fee from Torquay United in January 2010.|$|E
