50|$|Drone brood in worker cellsAnother good {{indicator}} is {{drone brood}} in worker sized cells. Drones are raised in larger cells than workers. Drone cells are recognizable by their larger size; and when capped, drone cells are capped with blunt pointed cappings. Drones in worker cells are {{a sure sign}} of a <b>failing</b> <b>queen</b> or laying worker.|$|E
50|$|Laying workers {{develop in}} the absence of open brood as {{produced}} by a healthy adult queen. Normally, pheromones from the brood - known as brood recognition pheromones - prevent development of the workers' ovaries. Laying workers can develop after the colony's queen has been lost to swarming, or {{in the presence of a}} <b>failing</b> <b>queen</b> which has yet to be superseded. The process of developing a laying worker usually takes weeks after the loss of the original queen. In adult laying workers there is an anatomic (and physiological) trade-off between the sizes of their more developed ovaries and their less developed food glands.|$|E
50|$|Drones are {{the largest}} bees in the hive (except for the queen), at almost {{twice the size of}} a worker bee. Note in the picture that they have much larger eyes than the workers have, presumably to better locate the queen during the mating flight. They do not work, do not forage for pollen or nectar, are unable to sting, and have no other known {{function}} than to mate with new queens and fertilize them on their mating flights. A bee colony generally starts to raise drones a few weeks before building queen cells so they can supersede a <b>failing</b> <b>queen</b> or prepare for swarming. When queen-raising for the season is over, bees in colder climates drive drones out of the hive to die, biting and tearing their legs and wings.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, a protesting punk {{was charged}} with lèse majesté for {{throwing}} a tomato at, but <b>failing</b> to hit <b>Queen</b> Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, who was in Oslo on her second state visit to Norway.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of February 6, 1992, Queen of Saanich and the {{passenger}} ship Royal Vancouver collided in heavy fog while navigating near the northern entrance of Active Pass. A total of 23 passengers aboard [...] Royal Vancouver were injured. Blame was cast on the crew of Royal Vancouver for <b>failing</b> to track <b>Queen</b> of Saanich on radar, though both vessels were equipped with sophisticated radar systems.|$|R
50|$|The High Warlock {{was and is}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} sorcerer in Forest Kingdom history. He was adviser to seven generations of Forest King, but was banished from the kingdom by King John for <b>failing</b> to save <b>Queen</b> Elinor. The High Warlock proceeded to drink himself into oblivion and bury himself in study of magic theory. Until Prince Rupert came to the Dark Tower for his aid.|$|R

5000|$|Satiromastix {{marks the}} end of the [...] "poetomachia"; in 1603, Jonson and Dekker collaborated again, on a pageant for the Royal Entry, delayed from the {{coronation}} of James I, for which Dekker also wrote the festival book The Magnificent Entertainment. After this commission, however, the early Jacobean period was notably mixed for the author. In late 1602, he appears to have broken his association with Henslowe, for unknown reasons. He wrote for Worcester's Men for a time, then returned to the Admiral's Men (now patronized by Prince Henry) to produce The Honest Whore, an apparent success. But the failures of The Whore of Babylon (1607) and If This Be Not a Good Play, the Devil is in It (1611) left him crestfallen; the latter play was rejected by Prince Henry's Men before <b>failing</b> for <b>Queen</b> Anne's Men at the Red Bull Theatre.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{what occurs}} {{in this book}} {{is not in the}} film, Merlin's mother Elissa is {{introduced}} as a Princess and novice Nun to Avalon who moves out with Ambrosia to Barnstable Forest when she becomes pregnant with Merlin. We further see Ambrosia's life and her <b>failing</b> faith in <b>Queen</b> Mab who gets Vortigern to take the throne of Britain from its Christian King Constance. Naturally some of the early events unfold such as the Lady of the Lake and Mab not agreeing on creating Merlin, etc. but we get to explore Merlin's magic education in the Lands of Magic under the hollow hill. An important element is Merlin being half magic and half human, where Fairy magic relies on illusion Merlin can make illusion real melding fairy spellcraft with human feeling merging the powers together in reality. Frik hides this and Merlin only uses it once in this book by shapeshifting into a bird. We meet Lord Idath the god of death and the wild hunt, Mab's former consort who does not fear as Mab does knowing there is life for him as long as mortals fear the shadow of midnight. The story ends just before Vortigern's men {{are on their way to}} get Merlin.|$|R
5000|$|On 18 December 1900 Alberta {{carried the}} Queen to the Isle of Wight {{for the last}} time. Aged 81, and in <b>failing</b> health, the <b>Queen</b> spent Christmas at Osborne, and her {{condition}} rapidly declined. Close {{members of her family}} were summoned, and on 19 January 1901 Alberta carried Prince Edward and Princess Louisa across the Solent to be at her bedside. Over the next few days Alberta conveyed numerous royal persons and their attendants across to the Isle of Wight, including the Prince of Wales and the Queen's grandson Kaiser Wilhelm II, on the morning of 21 January. Queen Victoria died in the evening of 22 January. After her body had been prepared, Admiral Sir John Fullerton and the officers of ceAlberta came ashore to pay their respects {{with the rest of the}} royal staff and servants.On 24 January Alberta carried the new King Edward VII back to Osborne after his journey to London for his proclamation as king. The Royal Standard, which had been lowered to half-mast following the Queen's death, was raised again, and the king took the salutes fired by the warships anchored in the Solent as he passed. [...] Arrangements were made for the funeral procession and service, and it was decided that Alberta would carry the Queen's body from Cowes to Gosport, passing through a line of warships. On the afternoon of 1 February the Queen's body was brought from Osborne to Cowes, and taken on board the Alberta moored alongside Trinity Pier. Her coffin was placed on a crimson platform on the sterndeck, covered by an awning, with an officer at attention, and the Royal Standard at half-mast. The rest of the royal family, including the King, boarded the larger Victoria and Albert.|$|R
