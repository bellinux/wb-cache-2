25|$|Tent City : Due to Edmonton's {{economic}} {{boom in the}} early years of the 20th century, the large <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> <b>newcomers</b> to Edmonton arrived to find no housing available. Fort Edmonton Park's tent city reflects the temporary solution that people used until houses could be built. This historical reproduction found a contemporary parallel in 2007, when economic prosperity in the province of Alberta meant that many of the poor could not afford rising rent costs, and a tent city was erected in downtown Edmonton populated by about two hundred homeless people.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the latter}} half of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth century, North Dakota, along with most of the midwest, {{experienced}} a mass <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> <b>newcomers,</b> from both the eastern United States and immigrants from Europe. North Dakota was a known popular destination for immigrant farmers and general laborers and their families, mostly from Norway, Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom. Much of this settlement gravitated throughout the western side of the Red River Valley, as was similarly seen in South Dakota and in a parallel manner in Minnesota. This area is well known for its fertile lands. By the outbreak of the First World War, this was among North America's richest farming regions. But a period of higher rainfall ended, and many migrants weren't successful in the arid conditions. Many family plots were too small to farm successfully.|$|E
25|$|Arlington {{during the}} 1960s was {{undergoing}} tremendous change after the huge <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> <b>newcomers</b> in the 1950s. The old commercial districts {{did not have}} ample off-street parking and many shoppers were taking their business to new commercial centers, such as Parkington and Seven Corners. Suburbs further out in Virginia and Maryland were expanding, and Arlington's main commercial center in Clarendon was declining, similar {{to what happened in}} other downtown centers. With the growth of these other suburbs, some planners and politicians pushed for highway expansion. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 would have enabled that expansion in Arlington. However, the administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency, economist C. Darwin Stolzenbach, saw the benefits of rapid transit for the region and oversaw plans for a below ground rapid transit system, now the Washington Metro, which included two lines in Arlington. Initial plans called for what became the Orange Line to parallel I-66, which would have mainly benefited Fairfax County. Arlington County officials called for the stations in Arlington to be placed along the decaying commercial corridor between Rosslyn and Ballston that included Clarendon. A new regional transportation planning entity was formed, the Washington, Metropolitan Transit Authority. Arlington officials renewed their push for a route that benefited the commercial corridor along Wilson Boulevard, which prevailed. There were neighborhood concerns that there would be high density development along the corridor that would disrupt the character of old neighborhoods. With population in the county declining, political leaders saw economic development as a long range benefit. Citizen input and county planners came up with a workable compromise, with some limits on development. The two lines in Arlington were inaugurated in 1977. The Orange Line's creation was more problematic than the Blue Line's. The Blue Line served the Pentagon and National Airport, and boosted the commercial development of Crystal City and Pentagon City. Property values along the Metro lines increased significantly for both residential and commercial property. The transformation of Clarendon is particularly striking, with its transformation from a downtown shopping area, ensuing decay, home to a vibrant Vietnamese business community in the 1970s and 1980s known as Little Saigon, and now is a vibrant urban village. Arlington's careful planning for the Metro has transformed the county and has become a model revitalization for older suburbs.|$|E

40|$|The paper aims at {{analyzing}} {{the impact of}} immigration of Syrian asylum seekers on the German energy market. Germany {{has been a leader}} of the energy transition, and has been effectively shaping European Union’s environmental policies. The unprecedented <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> the <b>newcomers</b> following the chancellor Merkel’s political move to open the boarders challenges feasibility of this project. This study evaluates the challenge from the supply and demand side of the energy market. It does so through the thorough examination of available data, government documents and literature to analyze historical developments and current implementation of the energy transition, together with Syrian impact on the energy market. The paper argues that although Syrian asylum seekers constitute {{only a small fraction of}} the whole group of incomers to Germany, the analysis of their impact suggests that usage of coal in the energy mix should not be expected to fall soon...|$|R
25|$|Historical sources {{mentions}} {{the settlement of}} Arab tribes {{and the establishment of}} new settlements in the 7th century, although little archaeological records have been preserved. However some Arabian settlements like Khirbet Suwwwana, located on outskirts of Jerusalem provides archaeological records of Islamic nomadic settlement and sedentarization among local population. The establishment of new Arab settlements during 7th and 8th century was relatively rare. The religious transformation of the land is evident with large congregation style mosques built in cities like Tiberias, Jarash, Beth Shean, Jerusalem and possibly Cesarea. However the establishment of these mosques point to the <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> Muslim <b>newcomers,</b> rather than to conversion of Jews and Christians to Islam. The settlement map of the land changed dramatically between 6th and 11th century. The sixth century map revealed an urban and rural society at its height, while the 11th century map shows a society that was economically and phiscally stagnant veering toward total collapse.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} questions in the rural gentrification literature is whether rural residents face difficulties in finding a home within their locality due to the <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> more wealthy <b>newcomers.</b> In this paper, we investigate {{the extent to which}} intended local movers and intended non-local movers have realised their rural residential preferences in their preferred municipality. We perform multilevel multinomial logistic regression analysis on data from two housing surveys for the Netherlands that are enriched with register data from the longitudinal Social Statistical Database (SSD). Our results show that, despite of their lower income, intended local movers are more likely to find homes within their preferred rural location than are intended non-local movers. Intended non-local movers move more often to a location other than that initially preferred, with urbanites facing a higher likelihood to move to an urban area. The findings suggest that ties to the residential environment are more important in successfully finding housing in one's preferred rural location than are financial resources. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2500|$|In 649/650, Sa'id was {{appointed}} governor of Kufa, replacing al-Walid ibn Uqba. During his tenure, his military reputation was boosted by campaigns in Azerbaijan {{and near the}} Caspian Sea. However, from the start, he faced issues with the Kufan elite, which consisted of Arab tribal settlers, Muslim veterans from the Battle of Qadisiyya and the qurra (Qur'an reciters). Many among the elite were incensed by Uthman's seizure of the conquered lands of the Sasanian royals and nobility in Iraq, which he planned to distribute to the tribesmen of Quraysh and certain men from Medina, {{in exchange for their}} properties in the Arabian Peninsula. Those two groups made up the early settlers in Kufa, {{who took part in the}} conquest of Iraq. By the time of Uthman, a large <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> <b>newcomers</b> from Arabia moved to Kufa and the Sawad, reducing the collective profits of the early settlers and prompting Sa'id to send a complaint about the crisis to Uthman in 651. Uthman's policy was meant to be a solution to this situation and stood in stark contrast to Caliph Umar (r. 634–644), under whom the Sawad lands were collectively held by the Muslim community. The newcomers were not able to benefit from the proposed land exchange since most did not own property elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{research}} domains of Latino/Hispanic education, educational leadership, and school/community relations, this ethnographic case study documents {{the creation and}} early development of the Georgia Project, a collaboration between Dalton (GA) Public Schools, the Universidad de Monterrey (of Mexico), and local Dalton leaders that was intended to help the schools and larger Dalton community negotiate a dramatic <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> Hispanic <b>newcomers.</b> This study situates the Georgia Project within the socio-historical and cultural domains of schooling and ethnic and class relations in both local and the regional contexts of Appalachia, Georgia, and The South. Then it examines the roles, beliefs, and actions of the six leaders most responsible for designing and implementing the Georgia Project, scrutinizing their evolving understandings and the actions that those understandings precipitated through mid- 1998. The study follows Nader 2 ̆ 7 s (1972) ‘studying up’ orientation regarding who should be studied—i. e., decision makers—and her recommendation that ‘multiple and eclectic’ field research methods should be employed. Analysis of the Project relies on Hatch 2 ̆ 7 s (1998) delineation of how different partners bring different theories of action to educational collaboration and is enhanced by Argyris and Schön 2 ̆ 7 s (1975) distinction between espoused theories and theories in use—two types of theories of action. The study concludes that, as {{of the end of}} the field research, the Georgia Project stood as a promising, multifaceted attempt to confront multiple obstacles that have limited Hispanic school success and socioeconomic mobility elsewhere. Crucially, it challenged existing distributions of power, which Sarason (1990) said was an essential condition of viable educational reform. However, the Georgia Project risked not realizing its promise for several reasons: (1) Its proponents who superficially agreed on its goals still embraced different theories of action; (2) It challenged the status quo and existing lines of authority (thus provoking defensive reactions); and (3) All its leaders had additional non-Project related tasks and obligations that could contradict their Project-related efforts and intents. An unannounced curriculum and school governance battle pitting Georgia Project-embraced bilingual education and enhanced practitioner control over the curriculum against the importation of the Direct Instruction model epitomized such contradictions. ...|$|R
40|$|Examining committee: Michael Hibbard, chairMany rural {{communities}} in the American West are in transition from natural resource extraction based economies to new forms of development. Those located in natural amenity rich areas are experiencing an <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> visitors and <b>newcomers</b> that drive increases in the demand for residential, retail, and service sector development. Despite the potency of natural amenity led development, planning theory concerned with employing amenity migration on behalf of community development is in its infancy. The Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Act is an important response {{to this type of}} development and serves as a case study of the evolving approach of the Federal Government in guiding the rural restructuring of the West. Through a combination of interviews and policy review this project explores the question: Has the National Scenic Act contributed to a new natural resource based economy, in which environmental protection has become the driver for nearby {{rural communities}}? The findings of this research suggest that the National Scenic Act has been implemented quite differently by Washington and Oregon; and these differences have contributed to significantly varying outcomes {{on opposite sides of the}} Columbia River. In particular, these findings imply that limiting economic growth to strictly defined urban areas can serve to protect agricultural economies, but may have substantial impacts on housing affordability. Overall, natural amenity led development is impacting all aspects of rural life and must be carefully planned if it is to result in a sustainable form of development for rural communities...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the development of}} ethnic business and its strategy in Tsuruhashi 2 ̆ 7 s Korea Town, {{one of the most}} well-known Korea Towns in Japan. The research focuses mainly on the seasoning used by food business operators. Tsuruhashi 2 ̆ 7 s Korea Town developed after World War II as a neighborhood with a large concentration of 2 ̆ 2 old-comer 2 ̆ 2 ethnic Koreans, and it was closely connected with the daily lives of its residents. In recent years, with an <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> South Korean <b>newcomers</b> and with the development of tourism, Tsuruhashi has become a well-known tourist spot. Tsuruhashi, alongside other Japanese Korea Towns such as Shin Okubo in Tokyo, gives people the opportunity to enjoy South Korean culture in Japan. That is why operators of ethnic businesses in Tsuruhashi need to cater to the needs of both Japanese tourists and local Korean residents. In order to study the strategies that they employ to this aim, I investigated the methods of seasoning used by food vendors. The findings of this survey are as follows: First, the operators of food related businesses are not long-time Korean residents of Japan, but mainly newcomers from South Korea. Second, local South Korean or North Korean residents form only a minority of the customer base, while the majority consists of Japanese tourists influenced by the recent boom for Korean culture in Japan. Given this background, it is clear {{that for the most part}} the seasoning, the major point that business strategy revolves around, is adapted to suit the tastes of Japanese tourists, although there may be some differences in approach among the sub-areas of the Tsuruhashi district...|$|R

50|$|In {{the context}} <b>of</b> the great <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> {{immigrants}} to Quebec, {{and more importantly}} to Montreal, {{in the years following}} World War II, changes seemed imperative in the Government’s policies in order to prevent the 30,000 annual immigrants from increasing the ranks of the English population.
