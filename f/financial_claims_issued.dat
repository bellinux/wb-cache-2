40|$|This article {{presents}} general {{conditions under which}} {{it is possible to}} obtain asset pricing relations from the intertemporal optimal investment decision of the firm. Under the assumption of linear homogeneous production and adjustment cost functions, it is possible to establish, state by state, the equality between the return on investment and the market return of the <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> <b>issued</b> by the firm. This result proves to be, in essence, robust to the consideration of very general constraints on investment and the inclusion of taxes. Copyright 1994 by American Finance Association. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{framework}} {{to assess the}} value of the <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> <b>issued</b> by the firm, European equity options and warrantsin terms of the stock price. In our framework, the firm's asset is assumed to follow a standard stationary lognormal process with constant volatility. However, it is not the case for equity volatility. The stochastic nature of equity volatility is endogenous, and comes from the impact of a change in {{the value of the}} firm's assets on the financial leverage. In a previous paper we studied the stochastic process for equity volatility, and proposed analytic approximations for different capital structures. In this companion paper we derive analytic approximations for the value of European equity options and warrants for a firm financed by equity, debt and warrants. We first present the basic model, which is an extension of the Black-Scholes model, to value corporate securities either as a function of the stock price, or as a function of the firm's total assets. Since stock prices are observable, then for practical purposes, traders prefer to use the stock as the underlying instrument, we concentrate on valuation models in terms of the stock price. Second, we derive an exact solution for the valuation in terms of the stock price of (i) a European call option on the stock of a levered firm, i. e. a European compound call option on the total assets of the firm, (ii) an equity warrant for an all-equity firm, and (iii) an equity warrant for a firm financed by equity and debt. Unfortunately, to compute these solutions we need to specify the function of the stock price in terms of the firm's assets value. In general we are unable to specify this expression, but we propose tight bounds for the value of these options which can be easily computed as a function of the stock price. Our results provide useful extensions of the Black-Scholes model. corporate finance, financial structure, leverage effect, option pricing, security valuation, stochastic volatility, warrants, numerical methods,...|$|E

5000|$|Once the money-commodity (e.g., gold, silver, bronze) is {{securely}} {{established as}} a stable medium of exchange, symbolic money-tokens (e.g., bank notes and debt <b>claims)</b> <b>issued</b> by the state, trading houses or corporations can in principle substitute paper money or debt obligations for the [...] "real thing" [...] on a regular basis. At first, these [...] "paper claims" [...] (legal tender) are by law convertible on demand into quantities of gold, silver etc., and they circulate alongside precious metals. But gradually currencies come into use that are not so convertible, i.e., [...] "fiduciary money" [...] or fiat money which relies on social trust that people will honor their transactional obligations. These kinds of fiduciary money rely not {{on the value of}} money-tokens themselves (as in commodity money), but on the ability to enforce <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> and contracts, principally by means of the power and laws of the state, but also by other institutional methods. Eventually, as Marx anticipated in 1844, precious metals play very little role anymore in the monetary system.|$|R

40|$|We {{establish}} rigorously {{the existence}} and properties of the stationary probability distribution which characterizes the accumulation of non-contingent <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> by a risk averse individual who confronts random wage fluctuations and incomplete insurance markets. We show that there exists a unique, almost-everywhere continuous stationary cumulative distribution function which characterizes the accumulation of non-contingent <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> in a stochastic steady-state. This distribution is shown to possess a single mass point coinciding with the non-negative, finite borrowing limit faced by the individual. We establish that the stationary distribution which characterizes the asset accumulation of low time preference individuals {{is at least as}} large, in the sense of first-degree stochastic dominance, as that of individuals with higher rates of time preference. We prove that, so long as individuals are allowed to borrow in amounts which can be repayed with probability one, additive differences in the probability distribution governing random wage earnings imply inversely proportional additive differences in the stationary probability distributions which govern the accumulation of non-contingent <b>financial</b> <b>claims.</b> ...|$|R
