5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} by brown-headed cowbirds is common, {{with up to}} 25% of Carolina wren nests {{being affected}} in certain regions such as Oklahoma and Alabama. Cowbird parasitism peaks in April at 41%, and is as low as 8% and 0% in July and August, respectively. Female cowbirds sometimes eject Carolina wren eggs before laying their own, and even if host eggs are retained, the size of cowbird eggs negatively affect the hatching success of wren eggs. As a result, cowbirds may {{have a significant impact}} on the reproductive success of wrens. The feeding rate for cowbird nestlings is higher than wren <b>feeding</b> <b>rates,</b> and some have been raised to independence. This also can be detrimental to the survival of wren nestlings. A rare instance of brood-parasitism by a house finch has been recorded. The rate of brood parasitism is thought to be lower in more natural and concealed nesting locations. Body parasites such as the larvae of blowflies feed on nestlings and the blood loss weakens nestlings. Fellow species of wren such as Bewick's wren and the winter wren compete for nesting locations and food, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The {{experiment}} of Kemenes et al. {{demonstrated that}} in an extrinsic modulatory neuron, nonsynaptic plasticity influences the expression of long-term associative memory. The relationship between nonsynaptic plasticity and memory was assessed using cerebral giant cells (CGCs). Depolarization from conditioned stimuli increased the neuronal network response. This depolarization lasted {{as long as the}} long-term memory. Persistent depolarization and behavioral memory expression occurred more than 24 hours after training, indicating long-term effects. In this experiment, the electrophysiological expression of the long-term memory trace was a conditioned stimulus induced feeding response. CGCs were significantly more depolarized in the trained organisms than the control group, indicating association with learning and excitability changes. When CGCs were depolarized, they showed an increased response to the conditional stimuli and a stronger fictive feeding response. This demonstrated that the depolarization is enough to produce a significant feeding response to the conditioned stimuli. [...] Additionally, no significant difference was observed in the <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> between conditioned organisms and ones that were artificially depolarized, reaffirming that depolarization is sufficient to generate the behavior associated with long-term memory.|$|E

For a Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) tool path, the critical {{points of the}} tool path where the radius of curvature reaches extreme values are found firstly. Then, the NURBS curve is split into several NURBS sub-curves or blocks by the critical points. A bidirectional scanning strategy with the limitations of chord error, normal/tangential acceleration/jerk and command <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> is employed to make the <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> at the junctions between different NURBS blocks continuous. To improve {{the efficiency of the}} <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> scheduling, the NURBS block is classified into three types: short block, medium block and long block. The <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> profile corresponding to each NURBS block is generated according to the start/end <b>feed</b> <b>rates</b> and the arc length of the block and the limitations of tangential acceleration/jerk. In addition, two compensation strategies are proposed to make the <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> more continuous and the arc increment more precise. Once the <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> profile is determined, a second-order Taylor׳s expansion interpolation method is applied to generate the position commands. Finally, experiments with two free-form NURBS curves are conducted to verify the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method...|$|R

There are three factors (spindle speed, <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> and drill diameter) under investigation, therefore, by applying RSM there will be 20 experimental observations.

When {{grinding}} {{the revolving}} curved surface with Arc Envelope Grinding Method, the different curvatures in the convex and concave surfaces {{make a great}} difference in the surface roughness.

The results presented that, low <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> of grinding wheel and high rotational speed of workpiece were helpful to obtain smaller envelope height.

They are {{released into the}} natural environment intentionally {{by people who are}} often unaware that the chemicals will travel further than anticipated, Hatakeyama et al. as cited in. Thus the pesticides largely affect the natural communities in which they are used. They negatively effect multiple levels ranging from molecules to tisues to organs to individuals to populations and onto communities. In the natural environment, a combination of pesticide exposure and natural stressors such as fluctuating temperature, food shortage or decreased oxygen availability are worse than when presented alone. Pesticides can affect the <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> of zoo-plankton. In the presence of pesticides zoo-plankton display lower <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> which result in reduced growth and reproduction. Swimming may also be affected by pesticides which poses a life-threatening issue for zoo-plankton as they swim to obtain food and nutrients and avoid predators. Such changes may alter predator-prey relationships.

Dominants perform more energetically costly behaviors (e.g. social policing and care) compared with subordinates, supporting the notion that energy expenditure drives liver investment.

5000|$|Some {{important}} aquatic and terrestrial ecological {{aspects of}} this salamander include its diet, predators, and microhabitat preferences. Larvae mainly feed on invertebrates such as insect larvae and worms. Larval growth rates differ depending on {{the temperature of the}} water and tend to be higher in the warmer months when water temperature is higher. The red salamander generally lays eggs in the fall and hatching season takes place in the late fall and winter. The larval period varies between 27 and 31 months and then metamorphosis takes place in the spring and early summer of the third year. Larval red salamanders are generalists, eating whatever is available. <b>Feeding</b> <b>rates</b> typically increase when water temperature is low and larger individuals feed more than smaller individuals. Although <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> appear to increase with increasing size, mortality rates, though, seem to be independent of size or age and survival is estimated to be about 50% per year. The longer larval period ensures that transformation occurs when the salamanders are much larger than other species of salamanders and typically have a short juvenile period, maturing quickly. Males mature at about 53 - 63 mm, typically at four years of age, and females mature at about 55 - 68 mm, typically at about five years of age. Red salamanders generally live in springs or streams during the winter and then disperse to and from these sites in the fall and spring. Due to its semiaquatic nature, the red salamander remains in terrestrial environments until early spring then disperses to more aquatic sites. Adults often live in burrows along streams and in other moist environments such as under logs and rocks along the forest floor. [...] Adult red salamanders, like their larvae, are generalists and tend to feed on invertebrates, as well as small amphibians. Its predators include birds and small carnivores such as skunks and raccoons. Since the red salamander is a large species of salamander, its presence or absence can greatly affect the ecosystem where it lives, and understanding its ecology is important to understand its role in community structures.|$|E
