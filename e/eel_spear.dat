In a minute, for he was practised at the game, the hideous mask was on his head, {{and with it the}} horns and skin of the widow's billy-goat; the tail and painted hides were tied about him, and in his hand he waved the <b>eel</b> <b>spear,</b> short-handled now. Thus arrayed he capered before the {{astonished}} King and Queen, shaking the tail that had a wire in it and clattering his hoofs upon the floor.|$|E

"A {{literary}} {{friend of}} mine, walking out one lovely evening last [...] summer, on the eleventh {{bridge of the}} Paddington canal, was alarmed by [...] the cry of 'one in jeopardy:' he rushed along, collected a body of [...] Irish haymakers (supping on buttermilk in an adjacent paddock), [...] procured three rakes, one <b>eel</b> <b>spear</b> and a landing-net, and at last [...] ('horresco referens') pulled out--his own publisher. The unfortunate [...] man was gone for ever, and so was a large quarto wherewith he had [...] taken the leap, which proved, on inquiry, to have been Mr. Southey's [...] last work. Its 'alacrity of sinking' was so great, that it has never [...] since been heard of; though some maintain that {{it is at this}} moment [...] concealed at Alderman Birch's pastry-premises, Cornhill. Be this as it [...] may, the coroner's inquest brought in a verdict of ''Felo de [...] Bibliopolâ'' against a quarto unknown,' and circumstantial evidence [...] being since strong against the 'Curse of Kehama' (of which the above [...] words are an exact description), it will be tried by its peers next [...] session, in Grub Street--Arthur, Alfred, Davideis, Richard Coeur de [...] Lion, Exodus, Exodiad, Epigoniad, Calvary, Fall of Cambria, Siege of [...] Acre, Don Roderick, and Tom Thumb the Great, are the names of the [...] twelve jurors. The judges are Pye, Bowles, and the bell-man of St. [...] Sepulchre's." ...|$|E

Two of his more famous paintings are <b>Eel</b> <b>Spearing</b> at Setauket (1845, New York State Historical Association, Cooperstown) and Bargaining for a Horse (1835, New-York Historical Society, New York City).|$|R

The first non-Māori to see Lake Wakatipu was European Nathanael Chalmers who {{was guided by}} Reko, {{the chief of the}} Tuturau, over the Waimea Plains and up the Mataura River in September 1853. Evidence of stake nets, baskets for catching <b>eels,</b> <b>spears</b> and ashes indicated the Glenorchy area was visited by Māori. It is likely Ngāi Tahu Māori visited Queenstown en route to collect Pounamu (greenstone). There was a settlement called Te Kirikiri Pa occupied by the tribe of Kāti Mamoe which was situated in the location of the current Queenstown Gardens, but by the time European migrants arrived in the 1860s this settlement was no longer being used.|$|R

5000|$|Margarethe ten Broek Fisher van den Meer is {{the mother}} of Iris and Ruth Fisher, and later becomes the {{stepmother}} of Clara after marrying her father. Her motives for marrying Clara’s father are purely to keep herself and her daughters fed. Whether she loves Clara’s father is unstated and unlikely, especially given her motto of [...] "Give me room to cast my <b>eel</b> <b>spear,</b> and let follow what may", but she is reasonably kind to him. It is hinted that the Master is interested in Margarethe, but his feelings are not returned. She is tough on all of the children and expect them {{to take care of her}} because she has more important things to do with her new life.|$|E
