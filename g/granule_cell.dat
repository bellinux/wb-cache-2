5|$|Granule cells receive all {{of their}} input from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the {{information}} in the <b>granule</b> <b>cell</b> population activity state is the same as {{the information in the}} mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because granule cells are so small and so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs. The idea is that with each <b>granule</b> <b>cell</b> receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a <b>granule</b> <b>cell</b> would not respond if only a single one of its inputs were active, but would respond if more than one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers {{enter the}} {{granular}} layer from their points of origin, many {{arising from the}} pontine nuclei, others from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, {{the total number of}} mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million. These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the granular layer, a mossy fiber generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy fibers and <b>granule</b> <b>cell</b> dendrites take place within structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 <b>granule</b> <b>cell</b> dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses onto the <b>granule</b> <b>cell</b> dendrites. The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells. Each mossy fiber sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20–30 rosettes; thus a single mossy fiber makes contact with an estimated 400–600 granule cells.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar granule cells, in {{contrast}} to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest neurons in the brain. They are also easily the most numerous neurons in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number average around 50 billion, which means that about 3/4 of the brain's neurons are cerebellar granule cells. Their cell bodies are packed into a thick layer {{at the bottom of}} the cerebellar cortex. A <b>granule</b> <b>cell</b> emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a dendritic claw. These enlargements are sites of excitatory input from mossy fibers and inhibitory input from Golgi cells.|$|E
50|$|Loss of dentate gyrus neurons {{from the}} {{hippocampus}} results in spatial memory deficits. Therefore, dentate <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> {{are thought to}} function {{in the formation of}} spatial memories.Immature and mature dentate <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> have distinct roles in memory function. Adult-born <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> are thought to be involved in pattern separation whereas old <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> contribute to rapid pattern completion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Granule</b> <b>cells</b> in {{different}} brain regions are both functionally and anatomically diverse: {{the only thing}} they have in common is smallness. For instance, olfactory bulb <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> are GABAergic and axonless, while <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> in the dentate gyrus have glutamatergic projection axons. These two populations of <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> are also the only major neuronal populations that undergo adult neurogenesis, while cerebellar and cortical <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> do not.Granule cells (save for those of the olfactory bulb) have a structure typical of a neuron consisting of dendrites, a soma (cell body) and an axon.|$|R
50|$|<b>Granule</b> <b>cells</b> {{are subject}} to {{feed-forward}} inhibition: <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> excite Purkinje cells but also excite GABAergic interneurons that inhibit Purkinje cells.|$|R
5|$|The perforant path is {{the main}} output pathway of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The flow of {{information}} in the hippocampus is largely unidirectional. Axons from the pyramidal cells (in EC layer II) perforate the subiculum to project mainly to the granular layer in the dentate gyrus (first synaptic connection). Some axons project to CA3 and a lesser number project to CA1. The dentate <b>granule</b> <b>cell</b> axons, called mossy fibers, pass on the information, to the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (second synaptic connection). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1. Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex (third synaptic connection) completing the trisynaptic loop or circuit.|$|E
5|$|The rostral migratory stream (RMS) is a {{specialized}} migratory route {{found in the}} brain of some animals along which neuronal precursors that originated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain migrate to reach the main olfactory bulb (OB). The importance of the RMS lies {{in its ability to}} refine and even change an animal's sensitivity to smells, which explains its importance and larger size in the rodent brain as compared to the human brain, as our olfactory sense is not as developed. This pathway has been studied in the rodent, rabbit, and both the squirrel monkey and rhesus monkey. When the neurons reach the OB they differentiate into GABAergic interneurons as they are integrated into either the <b>granule</b> <b>cell</b> layer or periglomerular layer.|$|E

50|$|TrkB is {{responsible}} for the maintenance of normal synaptic connectivity of the dentate <b>granule</b> <b>cells.</b> TrkB also regulates the specific morphology (biology) of the <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> and is thus said to be important in regulating neuronal development, neuronal plasticity, learning, and the development of epilepsy. The TrkB regulation of <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> is important in preventing memory deficits and limbic epilepsy. This {{is due to the fact}} that dentate <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> play a critical role in the function of the entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry in health and disease. Dentate <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> are situated to regulate the flow of information into the hippocampus, a structure required for normal learning and memory.|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the potential role of enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) {{in the development}} of epilepsy, we quantitatively analyzed the geometry of apical dendrites, synaptic transmission, and activation levels of normotopically distributed mature newborn <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> in the rat. SE in male Sprague-Dawley rats lasting for more than 2 hours was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine. The complexity, spine density, miniature post-synaptic currents, and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) expression of <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> born five days after SE were studied at least 10 weeks after CAG-GFP retroviral vector-mediated labeling. Mature <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> born after SE had dendritic complexity similar to that of <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> born naturally, but with denser mushroom-like spines in dendritic segments located in the outer molecular layer. Miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs) were similar between the controls and rats subjected to SE; however, smaller miniature excitatory post-synaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude with a trend toward less frequent was found in mature <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> born after SE. After maturation, <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> born after SE did not show denser Arc expression in the resting condition or after being activated by transient seizure activity than vicinal GFP-unlabeled <b>granule</b> <b>cells.</b> Thus our results suggest that normotopic <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> born after pilocarpine-induced SE are no more active when mature than age-matched, naturally born <b>granule</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|Primary {{culture of}} {{postnatal}} cerebellar <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> provides {{a model system that}} recapitulates many molecular events of developing <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo. Depolarization of cultured <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> increases intracellular Ca 2 + and activates Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent calcineurin (CaN) phosphatase. This Ca 2 + signaling mimics {{some of the}} signaling events for proliferation, migration, and differentiation of granule cellsin vivo. We investigated the genome-wide expression profiles of depolarization- and CaN-regulated genes in cultured mouse <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> and addressed their relevance to gene regulation in developing <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo. <b>Granule</b> <b>cells</b> were cultured under a nondepolarization condition (5 mM KCl) and a depolarization condition (25 mM KCl) with and without the CaN inhibitor FK 506. Gene expression profiles between depolarization and nondepolarization and between FK 506 treatment and untreatment were analyzed by microarray techniques. Both depolarization and FK 506 treatment influence expression levels {{of a large number of}} genes, most of which are overlapping, however, are conversely regulated by these two treatments. Importantly, many of the FK 506 -responsive genes are up- or down-regulated in parallel with gene expression in postnatal <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo. The FK 506 -down-regulated genes are highly expressed in proliferating/premigratory <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> and many of these genes encode cellular components involved in cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. In contrast, the FK 506 -up-regulated genes are predominantly expressed in postmigratory <b>granule</b> <b>cells,</b> including many functional molecules implicated in synaptic transmission and modulation.

New <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> were labeled by BrdUrd injection, and the mice were deprived of sensory input unilaterally by naris cauterization. During the initial 14 days after BrdUrd labeling, the number of BrdUrd-positive <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> was similar for deprived and undeprived OBs. At 28 days or later, the BrdUrd-positive cell number remarkably decreased in the deprived OB. Cauterization at days 14 – 28 effectively reduced the number of BrdUrd-positive <b>granule</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas 2 -week cauterization before or after this period produced little effect. Administration of diazepam, a GABAA receptor modulator, decreased the number of BrdUrd-positive <b>granule</b> <b>cells.</b> The diazepam administration was most effective at days 14 – 28. Histochemical examination showed that activation of caspase- 3 was accompanied by apoptotic <b>cell</b> death of <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> that was induced by sensory deprivation or diazepam administration. Double labeling with activated caspase- 3 and BrdUrd indicated that <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> at days 14 – 20 were most susceptible to cell death.

40|$|In the {{developing}} cerebellum, switching of the subunit composition of NMDA receptors occurs in <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> from NR 2 B-containing receptors to NR 2 C-containing ones. We investigated the mechanisms underlying switching of NR 2 B and NR 2 C subunit composition in primary cultures of mouse <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> at the physiological KCl concentration (5 mM). <b>Granule</b> <b>cells</b> extensively extended their neuritic processes 48 h {{after having been}} cultured in serum-free medium containing 5 mM KCl. Consistent with this morphological change, NR 2 B mRNA and NR 2 C mRNA were down- and up-regulated, respectively, in the <b>granule</b> <b>cells.</b> This dual regulation of the two mRNAs was abrogated by blocking excitation of <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> with TTX. This neuronal activity–dependent regulation of NR 2 B and NR 2 C mRNAs was abolished {{by the addition of}} selective antagonists of AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors. Furthermore, the dual regulation of NR 2 B and NR 2 C mRNAs in TTX-treated cells was restored by the addition of NMDA {{in the presence of the}} AMPA receptor antagonist, but not by that of AMPA in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist. Importantly, the NMDA receptor activation drove the NR 2 B/NR 2 C switching of NMDA receptors in the cell-surface membrane of <b>granule</b> <b>cells.</b> This investigation demonstrates that stimulation of NMDA receptors in conjunction with the AMPA receptor–mediated excitation of <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> plays a key role in functional subunit switching of NMDA receptors in maturing <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> at the physiological KCl concentration...|$|R
40|$|Dentate <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> {{are born}} {{throughout}} {{life in the}} mammalian hippocampus.

Analysis of transgenic pedigrees with truncation or deletion mutations indicated that EGFP expression in the dentate gyrus required cryptic POMC promoter regions dispensable for arcuate hypothalamic or pituitary expression. Unlike arcuate neurons, dentate <b>granule</b> <b>cells</b> did not express the endogenous POMC gene. EGFP-positive neurons had immature properties, including short spineless dendrites and small action potentials.
