40|$|A {{satellite}} communication {{system based on}} the use of a multiple, contiguous beam satellite antenna and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) is studied. Emphasis is on the evaluation of the feasibility of SS (satellite switching) FDMA technology, particularly the multiple, contiguous beam antenna, the onboard switch and channelization, and on methods to overcome the effects of severe Ka band fading caused by precipitation. This technology is evaluated and plans for technology development and evaluation are given. The application of SS-FDMA to domestic {{satellite communication}}s is also evaluated. Due to the potentially low cost Earth stations, SS-FDMA is particularly attractive for thin route applications up to several hundred kilobits per second, and offers the potential for competing with terrestrial facilities at low data rates and over short routes. The onboard switch also provides added route flexibility for <b>heavy</b> <b>route</b> systems. The key beneficial SS-FDMA strategy is to simplify and thus reduce the cost of the direct access Earth station at the expense of increased satellite complexity...|$|E
50|$|Whenever possible, {{the basic}} {{military}} road network {{is composed of}} average routes and includes a number of <b>heavy</b> traffic <b>routes</b> and a few very <b>heavy</b> traffic <b>routes.</b> The class of a military road maneuver network is fixed by the minimum route classification of the network.

50|$|The Bonn Stadtbahn {{operates}} over former tram and <b>heavy</b> rail <b>routes,</b> which were either rebuilt for city rail traffic or replaced by underground lines.

40|$|The use of open-graded mixes {{increases}} significantly {{the hydraulic}} permeability of pavement {{and contributes to}} reduce the noise impact in comparison to traditional pavement. Such characteristics are very appealing and would greatly increase driver's safety. However, during service life, the pores tend to be clogged by many factors among them secondary traffic compaction and filling of voids by fine materials are relevant, especially on <b>heavy</b> <b>routes.</b> In this case the noise reduction and drainage capabilities will gradually disappear, causing serious problems for road safety and maintenance. In this {{paper we propose a}} simulation approach in order to predict the drainage and acoustic behavior of open-graded mixes during service life. This numerical procedure allows to investigate the correlations between some indicators, extrapolated from the simulation, and the behavior of open-graded mixes, in order to optimize the design of the mix and the road maintenance. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R

50|$|A {{total of}} 27,999 rkm was {{electrified}} by 31 March 2016, mostly on <b>heavy</b> density <b>routes.</b> This constitutes about 42.42% {{of the total}} railway network.

The 12th Plan target for electrification is set at above 6,500 rkm and the target to be realised during 2012-13 and 2013-14 is 2,667 rkm and 2014-15 is 1089 rkm.

50|$|It is {{situated}} between Vezirhan and Bilecik bypassing the Gülümbe Pass with hairpin turns. The 2465 and 2474 m-long twin-tube tunnel carries two lanes of traffic in each direction. The 745 and 840 m-long Ertuğrulgazi Tunnel is located north of it. The highway Mekece-Bilecik-Bozüyük on the north-south directed D.650 {{at a distance}} of 86 km is a <b>heavy</b> traffic <b>route</b> for transport of industrial and agricultural products connecting the regions Marmara, Aegiean, Central Anatoli and Mediterranean.|$|R
50|$|Enabling {{works and}} {{allowance}} for the Avondale-Southdown Line {{are a part}} of constructing SH20. KiwiRail sees this route as strategically important as it is the only real alternative for a cross-isthmus <b>heavy</b> rail <b>route,</b> as upgrading of the existing Newmarket Line is not realistically feasible or possible. KiwiRail requested that any tunnel construction not preclude rail above it in the future, nor the possibility of rail being trenched to cross below New North Road to connect to the existing North Auckland Line.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, several light rail systems have high-platform stops or {{stations}} with dedicated platforms at railway platform height. Reasons for this include systems being created from former <b>heavy</b> rail <b>routes</b> (as {{in the case}} of the Metrolink system in Greater Manchester, England), or to provide a more rapid transit-like commuting experience (such as the Metro Rail system in Los Angeles, California). Such trams also stop at dedicated platform stops on Stadtbahns in Germany, especially in underground stations in city centres.|$|R

25|$|After the {{commercial}} and artistic climax for the genre, {{the energy of the}} thrash metal was exhausted and it was overtaken by the rising alternative metal and grunge movements. In the 1990s many veteran thrash metal bands began changing to more accessible, radio-friendly styles. Metallica was a notable example of this shift, particularly with their mid–to–late 1990s albums Load, and ReLoad, which displayed minor blues and southern rock influences, and were seen as a major departure from the band's earlier sound. Megadeth took a more accessible <b>heavy</b> metal <b>route</b> starting with their 1992 album Countdown to Extinction, and Testament released the melodic The Ritual in 1992.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{research}} undertaken in Australia on traffic noise is reviewed and summarised. The noise from traffic {{is dependent on}} a number of variants as it does not remain constant. The variants are volume, speed and quantity of vehicles affecting the noise of traffic; in the main an increase in any one of these variants or combination of the variants will cause an increase in traffic noise. This paper considers the options of noise mitigation for dwellings close to <b>heavy</b> vehicle <b>routes</b> including the possibility for incorporating natural ventilation into housing designs for minimum energy consumption for the Australian context.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze and compare the air freight rate {{structure}} of commercial air freight carriers and the U. S.

AMC's channel flight system, operated over specific <b>heavy</b> shipment <b>routes,</b> {{was used as a}} baseline for comparison purposes. Associated air freight services are examined to address possible value added properties from a Departrnent of Defense (DOD) perspective.

40|$|Transportation {{construction}} {{activities on}} <b>heavy</b> traffic <b>routes</b> {{can be very}} disruptive to the system users due to lane closures, construction traffic, or reduced speed zones. Besides the driving public, local businesses are also affected by noise and air pollution, loss of access, or changing access routes. Thus, {{it is apparent that}} minimizing construction time will lessen these impacts. The primary objectives of this project are to explore some alternative methods to expedite construction time for particular project types whereby mitigating disruptions to the traveling public and to identify construction activities that can be accelerated by those selected methods. To accomplish these objectives, this project evaluated state-of-the-art construction techniques for accelerating processes at the jobsite by investigating practices of other transportation agencies (DOT) and their cost implications...|$|R

50|$|The Sirhowy Railway, the {{property}} of the London and North Western Railway, was used to divert mineral trains for the eastern and southern parts of the GWR away from Pontypool. This depended on good relations with the LNWR, which were not always co-operative, but in time (from 1877) this became the primary route (via Nine Mile Point and Newport). There was a loading restriction on the Crumlin Viaduct and as locomotives in use became <b>heavier,</b> the Sirhowy <b>route</b> also alleviated that problem.|$|R
