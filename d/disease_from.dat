Though he no longer serves in Congress, Bedell remains active in Iowa politics, strongly supporting Howard Dean in 2004 over John Kerry.

5|$|Bedell {{decided not}} to seek reelection in 1986 after {{contracting}} Lyme <b>Disease</b> <b>from</b> a tick bite. Since then, he has founded a center for alternative medicine and is a noted advocate of health freedom. Due largely to his friendship with Tom Harkin, he remains an important political figure in Iowa, with politicians such as Howard Dean meeting him in their trips to the state. Also, the Elinor Bedell State Park was established in 1998 on land donated by Berkley and Elinor Bedell. The park is named after the Congressman's wife.|$|E

5|$|For {{functioning}} tumors, the somatostatin analog {{class of}} medications, such as octreotide, {{can reduce the}} excessive production of hormones. Lanreotide can slow tumor growth. If the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and is causing symptoms, targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib can reduce symptoms and slow progression of the disease. Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally not very effective for PanNETs, but may be used when other drug treatments fail to prevent the <b>disease</b> <b>from</b> progressing, or in poorly differentiated PanNET cancers.|$|E
5|$|Sayid {{escapes from}} Rousseau's bunker {{while she is}} gone, {{grabbing}} a rifle, maps and notes she has made about the island. Rousseau finds him {{and they have a}} standoff; he tries to fire the rifle, but no bullet discharges. Rousseau says she removed the firing pin, and Robert, her former lover, made the same mistake before she killed him. She reveals that it was she who killed her team, aiming to stop the <b>disease</b> <b>from</b> reaching the outside world. Sayid talks Rousseau into letting him go, but, before leaving, asks about Alex. Rousseau says that Alex was her child. While trying to find his way back to camp, Sayid hears the whispering of which Rousseau had spoken.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the Spanish flu pandemic, and the {{relationship}} between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease. Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the <b>disease</b> <b>from</b> humans.|$|E
5|$|The ritual was {{normally}} performed between Michaelmas and Easter, when {{cold weather}} made it {{less likely to}} contract a <b>disease</b> <b>from</b> the infected subject. It was believed that the treatment {{was more likely to}} be successful if performed on a holy day. English monarchs generally touched less frequently than their French counterparts. Edward I touched up to 1,736 people annually, but did not touch during his frequent military campaigns abroad. His immediate successors followed a similar pattern.|$|E
5|$|Though {{concentrated}} in London, the outbreak affected {{other areas of}} the country as well. Perhaps the most famous example was the village of Eyam in Derbyshire. The plague allegedly arrived with a merchant carrying a parcel of cloth sent from London, although this is a disputed point. The villagers imposed a quarantine on themselves to stop the further spread of the disease. This prevented the <b>disease</b> <b>from</b> moving into surrounding areas but the cost to the village was the death of around 80% of its inhabitants over a period of fourteen months.|$|E

5|$|After a {{month with}} his new wife, Sing {{returned}} to the trenches in France in August 1917, but was in very poor health due to his battle wounds {{and the effects of}} gas poisoning. It is not clear whether he operated as a sniper on the Western Front, but in September 1917, he led a unit in the Battle of Polygon Wood in counter-sniper operations. For this action, he was awarded the Oorlogskruis (Belgian Croix de Guerre) in 1918, and was also recommended for the Military Medal—but never received it. In November 1917, he was confined to hospital again due to problems with his previously wounded leg. In mid-February 1918, he was hospitalised due to a gunshot wound in the back. Sing suffered lung <b>disease</b> <b>from</b> his exposure to gas, and it soon brought his military career to an end.|$|E
5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told {{the only way he could}} buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one <b>disease</b> <b>from</b> actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Monroe took an 18-month hiatus from work to concentrate on married life on the East Coast. She and Miller split their time between their Manhattan apartment and an eighteenth-century farmhouse that they purchased in Roxbury, Connecticut; they spent the summer in Amagansett, Long Island. She became pregnant in mid-1957, but it was ectopic {{and had to be}} terminated. She suffered a miscarriage a year later. Her gynecological problems were largely caused by endometriosis, a <b>disease</b> <b>from</b> which she suffered throughout her adult life. Monroe was also briefly hospitalized during this time due to a barbiturate overdose. During the hiatus, she dismissed Greene from MMP and bought his share of the company as they could not settle their disagreements and she had begun to suspect that he was embezzling money from the company.|$|E

5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe <b>disease</b> <b>from</b> secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas may {{contract}} brucellosis, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. They {{are vulnerable}} to Trypanosoma congolense, which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from tsetse flies. It is known that adult spotted hyenas in the Serengeti have antibodies against rabies, canine herpes, canine brucella, canine parvovirus, feline calici, leptospirosis, bovine brucella, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. During the canine distemper outbreak of 1993–94, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from hyenas and lions were {{more closely related to}} each other than to the closest canine distemper virus in dogs. Evidence of canine distemper in spotted hyenas has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to rabies does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a rabies vector, thus indicating that the species catches the <b>disease</b> <b>from</b> other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The microfilaria of Dipetalonema dracuneuloides have been recorded in spotted hyenas in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three cestode species of the genus Taenia, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries protozoan parasites of the genus Hepatozoon in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted hyenas may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores; Taenia hyaenae and T. olnogojinae occur in hyenas in their adult phase. Trichinella spiralis are found as cysts in hyena muscles.|$|E
