In their 1979 review of the author, Kartini et al. were able to <b>find</b> <b>only</b> six extant titles. It {{is difficult to determine}} the original year of publication for these works, for although Joehana's books generally included a year of publication, the printing number was not recorded. As such, sources list works as having been published in different years; for instance, Tjarios Agan Permas is variously dated 1923, 1926, and 1928.|$|E

5|$|The {{reversal}} of course {{brought her back}} in range of the British battlecruisers, however, which quickly opened fire and scored several damaging hits. The order to abandon ship was given, and men began gathering on the deck. Engineers set scuttling charges while the men topside prepared {{to go into the}} water. At 14:25, the ship rolled over and sank. The survivors expected the British to pick them up, but they instead departed. German ships searched the area three days later, to <b>find</b> <b>only</b> one survivor, Leading Stoker Neumann; {{the rest of the crew}} had died in the water. The wreck was moved in August 1979 to render it less of an underwater hazard. Some parts of the ship were salvaged and are now preserved in the Cuxhaven Shipwreck Museum.|$|E

Mystique saves Lehnsherr by taking {{a shot of the}} mutant cure aimed at him, rendering Raven Darkhölme human. Hateful of humans, Lehnsherr abandons Darkhölme, much to her shock and disappointment. Meanwhile, Scott Summers, still distraught over the loss of his fiancée, Jean Grey, drives to her resting location at Alkali Lake. Jean appears to Summers but, as the two kiss, Jean kills him. Sensing trouble, Xavier sends Logan and Storm to investigate. When they arrive, they <b>find</b> <b>only</b> telekinetically floating rocks, Summers' glasses, and an unconscious Jean.|$|E
5|$|From c.1824 the {{movement}} of European colonists and their farming practices onto Pallittorre lands brought the two groups into often violent conflict. The conflict increased over time. In retaliation for acts by Europeans, killings of settlers by aborigines in 1827 {{appear to have been}} part of a coordinated effort to drive the settlers away. The conflict and violence was from both Europeans and aborigines, though more the former than latter. European disease, deliberate killings, forced exile to the islands of Bass Strait, and the driving of the natives from their land and food sources reduced their population. This reduction was such that during an 1834 visit George Augustus Robinson, Protector of Aborigines, could <b>find</b> <b>only</b> one woman in the area. There are only records of two colonists killed by the Pallittorre. The number of Pallittorre killed is not recorded; Shayne Breen—Lecturer in Aboriginal Studies at the University of Tasmania—has estimated more than one hundred. The removal of the Pallittorre from their land, a pattern echoed across Tasmania, was largely intentional. Deliberate policy, promulgated by Governor Arthur, was to remove the native population from the land and grant it to European settlers.|$|E

5|$|The daily {{syndicated}} {{version of}} Wheel premiered on September 19, 1983, {{preceded by a}} series of episodes taped on location at the Ohio State Fair and aired on WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio. From its debut, the syndicated version offered a larger prize budget than its network counterpart. The show came from humble beginnings: King World chairmen Roger, Michael, and Robert King could initially <b>find</b> <b>only</b> 50 stations that were willing to carry the show, and since they could not find affiliates for the syndicated Wheel in New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago, Philadelphia was the largest market in which the show could succeed in its early days. Only nine stations carried the show from its beginning, but by midseason it was airing on all 50 of the stations that were initially willing to carry it, and by the beginning of 1984 the show was available to 99 percent of television households. Soon,Wheel succeeded Family Feud as the highest-rated syndicated show, and {{at the beginning of the}} 1984–85 season, Griffin followed up on the show's success by launching a syndicated revival of Jeopardy!, hosted by Alex Trebek. The syndicated success of Wheel and Jeopardy! siphoned ratings from the period's three longest-running and most popular game shows, Tic-Tac-Dough, The Joker's Wild, and Family Feud, to the point that all three series came to an end by the fall of 1986. At this point, Wheel had the highest ratings of any syndicated television series in history, and at the peak of the show's popularity, over 40 million people were watching five nights per week. The series, along with companion series Jeopardy!, remained the most-watched syndicated program in the United States until dethroned by Judge Judy in 2011. The program has become America's longest-running syndicated game show and its second-longest in either network or syndication, second to the version of The Price Is Right which began airing in 1972. The syndicated Wheel has become part of the consciousness of over 90 million Americans, and awarded a total of over $200 million in cash and prizes to contestants.|$|E

25|$|The {{classification}} of text {{as belonging to}} the triple tradition (or for that matter, double tradition) is not always definitive, depending rather {{on the degree of}} similarity demanded. For example, Matthew and Mark report the cursing of the fig tree, clearly a single incident, despite some substantial differences of wording and content. Searching Luke, however, we <b>find</b> <b>only</b> the parable of the barren fig tree, in a different point of the narrative. Some would say that Luke has extensively adapted an element of the triple tradition, while others would regard it as a distinct pericope.|$|E

25|$|An earlier survey, {{conducted}} from 1997 to 1998, reported about 2% of furry respondents stating {{an interest}} in zoophilia, and less than 1% {{an interest in}} plushophilia (sexually aroused by stuffed animal toys). The older, lower results, which are even lower than estimated in the general population, were due to the methodology of questioning respondents face-to-face, which led to social desirability bias. In contrast, one study showed 7.5% of college students reporting zoophilia, while other studies <b>find</b> <b>only</b> 2.2% to 5.3% expressing fantasies of sex with animals.|$|E
25|$|Child labour in India is {{a complex}} problem that is rooted in poverty. Since the 1990s, the {{government}} has implemented a variety of programs to eliminate child labour. These have included setting up schools, launching free school lunch programs, creating special investigation cells, etc. Author Sonalde Desai stated that recent studies on child labour in India have found some pockets of industries in which children are employed, but overall, relatively few Indian children are employed. Child labour below the age of 10 is now rare. In the 10–14 age group, the latest surveys <b>find</b> <b>only</b> 2% of children working for wage, while another 9% work within their home or rural farms assisting their parents in times of high work demand such as sowing and harvesting of crops.|$|E

Ruggiero informed Gravano that he and Gotti were planning to murder Castellano and asked for Gravano's support. Gravano was initially noncommittal, wanting to confer first with Frank DeCicco. In conversation with DeCicco, both men voiced concern that Castellano would designate his nephew, Thomas Gambino, acting boss and his driver, Thomas Bilotti, underboss in the event he was convicted and sent to prison. Neither man appealed to Gravano or DeCicco as leadership material, and they ultimately decided to support the hit on Castellano.|$|E

25|$|In 100,000 BC, {{a flying}} saucer flies towards Earth, landing in Antarctica. In 1982 in Antarctica, a Norwegian {{helicopter}} pursues an Alaskan Malamute to an American research station. Upon landing, a Norwegian accidentally drops a thermite charge, destroying the helicopter. The surviving Norwegian raises a rifle at the station personnel and is shot dead by Garry, the station commander. The Americans send a helicopter pilot, R.J.

25|$|The {{interest}} in the sociology of law continues to be more widespread in Western countries. Some important research has been produced by Indian scholars, but we <b>find</b> <b>only</b> {{a limited amount of}} socio-legal work by researchers from, for example, the Middle East or central and northern parts of Africa. Thus, the global spread of sociological studies of law appears uneven and concentrated, above all, in industrialised nations with democratic political systems. In this sense, the global expansion of legal sociology “is not taking place uniformly across national boundaries and appears to correlate with a combination of factors such as national wealth/poverty and form of political organisation, as well as historical factors such as the growth of the welfare state... However, none of these factors alone can explain this disparity”.|$|E
25|$|Women outnumbered men {{in every}} age group besides 15 and under; the {{imbalance}} was most severe in the 25-39 age group, with only 71 men for every 100 women. This gender gap is mainly {{the result of}} the so-called astronaut family phenomenon, also seen among Chinese New Zealanders and Koreans in other countries, in which male heads of households who found their earning power decreased after emigration returned to their country of origin while their wives and children remained in the destination country. Although many heads of households qualified for New Zealand immigration due to their professional qualifications, they <b>find</b> <b>only</b> unskilled work is available to them due to their poor English skills. The high levels of unemployment among Koreans in New Zealand mean that their median personal income was only NZ$5,700, according to Department of Labour statistics.|$|E
