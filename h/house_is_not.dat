5|$|Detective Michael Tritter is a {{recurring}} fictional {{character in the}} medical drama series House, portrayed by David Morse. He is the main antagonist of the third season, which ran between 2006 and 2007. Tritter is a police detective, who tries to get Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) to apologize for leaving him in an examination room with a thermometer in his rectum. After House refuses to apologize, Tritter researches House's background and discovers his Vicodin addiction. Tritter turns people close to House against him and forces House to go to rehab. When the case ultimately comes to court, the judge sentences House to one night in jail, for contempt of court, and to finish his rehabilitation, telling Tritter that she believes <b>House</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the drug addict {{he tried to make}} him out to be.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Wong created Wandering Home, an {{installation}} {{consisting of a}} mobile home conceptualised on city living and the homeless, which was shown at the Venice Biennale of Architecture. The small tin hut {{on the back of}} a tricycle is a comment on Hong Kong society, and the plight of people who sleep on the streets and who are forced to move on periodically by government officials. Costing HK$5,000 to make, the <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> exactly a practical solution to the homeless, but the concept was tried out on street sleepers in Sham Shui Po. In 2008, Wong created Tin Man No.11, an essay in space in the form of a metallic robot that transforms into a bed. He extended the concept by creating Famiglia Grande, a series of transformable cases. In 2009, Wong attended the Subvision Festival in Hamburg as a skyscraper.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} protect their vault {{in a number}} of ways, such as {{building}} walls, keeping guard dogs, setting up traps such as electrified floors and bottomless pits, and giving guns to the player's family members so that they can defend the vault as well. The game does not punish the player for family members—by default, a wife and two children—being murdered by intruders; the player can even view footage of the incident afterwards. Rather, protecting the money is the goal the game emphasizes. The player starts off with $2,000 in cash and steals more from others' vaults; {{it can be used to}} purchase more objects to defend one's own vault. Additionally, a <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> accessible by thieves when its owner is retooling it for defense.|$|E

5|$|The Charles Payne House is a -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage {{that has}} a spacious garden founded {{on the site of}} a long-removed house. The house's gable end faces the street with a rear ell and the other ell {{perpendicular}} to the main block on the west side. Centered on the east end of the roof is a cross gable which is visually offset by the dormer on the west. The house has a small gable-roofed vestibule on the east side, aligned underneath the cross-gable. The rear ell has an attached porch that spans its length. A single story bay hexagonal bay window protrudes from the facade. The distinguishing feature of the Payne house is the wood trim exterior, consisting of hood mould on the paired windows on the south, four kinds of bargeboards and bracketed cornices on the rear ell's east side. The interior of the Charles Payne <b>House</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> covered in detail by any survey, but has three mantelpieces on the first floor, two displaying Gothic Revival influence in their wooden designs and the third, located in the rear ell, made of grey marble with a round-head opening. Though not mentioned in the nomination, a photo shows one of the wooden mantlepieces filled with brick and rendered unusable at the time. The setting of the house was important to the National Register nomination, which specifically highlighted its shaded garden and fencing. At the time of the nomination, an ornamental round head picket fence surrounded the property and access was through a double-leaf lattice work gate. By 2013, the picket fence and entrance gate had been removed, but the property still retains the street frontage for its garden.|$|E
5|$|When {{the act is}} assented to by the {{sovereign}} in person, or by empowered Royal Commissioners, royal assent is considered given {{at the moment when}} the assent is declared in the presence of both houses jointly assembled. When the procedure created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 is followed, assent is considered granted when the presiding officers of both houses, having received the letters patent from the king or queen signifying the assent, have notified their respective house of the grant of royal assent. Thus, if each presiding officer makes the announcement at a different time (for instance because one <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> sitting on a certain date), assent is regarded as effective when the second announcement is made. This is important because, under British Law, unless there is any provision to the contrary, an act takes effect on the date on which it receives royal assent and that date is not regarded as being the date when the letters patent are signed, or when they are delivered to the presiding officers of each house, but the date on which both houses have been formally acquainted of the assent.|$|E

25|$|Committee {{chairmanship}} in the House {{is often}} associated with seniority, especially in the Democratic Caucus.

25|$|The raised ranch is {{a two-story}} house, {{in which a}} {{finished}} basement serves as an additional floor.

However, it does not become a raised ranch simply by having two floors. For {{it to be a}} raised ranch, you will have to climb a flight of steps to get to the main living floor - if not it is just a bi-level house.

25|$|In 1966, the {{relocation}} of NY282 from Bridge Street in Smithboro was approved with the elimination of a grade crossing with the Lehigh Valley Railroad tracks. The project would also involve {{the elimination of the}} crossing on NY282 of the Erie-Lackawanna Railway. On January 22,1967, the state announced that they wished to update the proposed grade crossing elimination with local opposition exerting pressure because of new construction in the area. The New York State Department of Public Works now proposed that the elimination would still occur with the fact that NY282 would end up being relocated eastward as part of construction of the Southern Tier Expressway, but that NY282's old alignment would be open until a point south of the grade crossing so that access to a nearby <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> cut off, along with new houses being constructed in the area.|$|E
25|$|A two-storey {{residence}} for railway officials with a hipped roof {{was built in}} 1910 in the triangle between the curve to the north Ringbahn, the Stadtbahn and the Ringbahn.

An outline application by Deutsche Bahn in 2008 {{for the development of the}} site was rejected by the conservation authorities. After receiving no undertakings from Deutsche Bahn to protect it, the heritage protection authority adopted an order in March 2010 requiring measures to protect the building from the penetration of rain water and the effects of storms and vandalism. In November 2010, Deutsche Bahn began work for the conservation of the house. The building was completely surrounded by scaffolding and given a solid metal canopy. The repair of the officials’ <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> expected before the end of construction at the station because it would not be practical to use the house during the construction.|$|E
25|$|Among a {{small area}} of the Urata-Igbo {{cultural}} area, near Owerri, there is a tradition of building votive monument houses called ḿbàrí primarily dedicated to the ágbàrà Àlà specific {{to the community and}} sometimes other community deities. The name joins the word ḿbà ('nation, town, society') + rí ('eat') in reference to the 'festival of life' held after its completion. These votive shrines are typically designed with four columns and a central volt, around the columns are modelled deities, spirits, and depictions of human life, the entire building built out of clay from termite mounds symbolically named jí ('yam') by the initiated spirit workers called ńdí m̀gbè. Ndi mgbe are secluded from the community {{for a couple of months}} during the rites of building the mbari to a deity. Mbari are requested by a deity who the diviner tells the community feels neglected and cannot feel pride in the face of other deities in the spirit world. A string of unusual and unfortunate events befalling the community is linked to the aggrieved deity. An mbari is commissioned and artists are chosen. After the completion of the mbari the spirit workers are reincorporated into the community and a feast is held for the opening of the mbari house where elders and the community come to exhibit the critique the expensive mbari. The mbari <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a source of worship and is left to dilapidate, being reabsorbed by nature in symbolic sense related to Ala.|$|E
