500|$|The {{painting}} {{technique of}} tsukuri-e ("built painting"), used mainly in emaki {{of the court}} in the twelfth century, is also used here. It is done in three stages: a first sketch of the scene is made with <b>Indian</b> <b>ink</b> (probably by {{a master of the}} workshop), then the color is applied on the entire surface of the paper in a specific order, from large areas in the background to fine details. Finally, the contours are enhanced or revived in ink to emphasize the depth. However, a visible change in style may again be noted, because the pigments are here less opaque than usual, and the more subtle shades are highlighted by fine outlines in ink; and in addition, the decorative aspect emerges strongly through extensive use of gold dust, and sometimes of silver. According to Mason, the technique seems to be less careful than in the past, {{as can be seen in}} elements of the architectural interior (sliding doors, screens ...) which lack detail or in the silver powder which is used much less often in general compared to gold.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} technique {{could be}} of interest for all applications requiring the characterization of light-scattering properties of suspensions, like solar energy exploitation and biological tissue optics. As for this latter application, {{the results of our}} investigations on SWCNH suspensions show that they can be promising, especially when they are compared to absorber materials currently used in liquid phantoms, i.e., <b>Indian</b> <b>inks</b> [17]. It should be emphasized that literature values of scattering albedo for <b>Indian</b> <b>inks</b> at NIR wavelengths lie between 10 % and 16 %. For this reason, the ink behavior is far from that of an ideal absorber whose properties are a high absorption coefficient and a 0 % scattering. In this framework, SWCNH-based nanofluids, thanks to their low albedo values, have the potential to be an excellent absorbing standard for biological tissue optics.|$|R
50|$|Graining {{is the art}} of {{imitating the}} {{different}} types of natural wood grain. It ranges from simple Clair Bois to intricate English Walnut. There are basically two types of wood graining: coarse (rustic) and fine (polite). In fine graining, layers are built up using water colors and finished with an oil glaze. Water colors use a beer solution tinted with a pigment, <b>Indian</b> <b>inks,</b> or Vandyke crystals dissolved in water. Vandyke crystals are very dark, almost a match for burnt umber but by varying the amount of water a color range from pale brown to nearly black can be obtained.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{a simple}} {{spectrophotometric}} method {{is applied to}} the calculation of the spectral scattering albedo of SWCNHs. The results show a satisfactory agreement with those obtained from monochromatic measurements reported in the literature and performed with a different technique. Thus, the present paper confirms that SWCNHs have a very low scattering albedo (not higher than 5 % for red and NIR wavelengths) as compared to <b>Indian</b> <b>inks</b> (about 10 % to 16 % scattering). Moreover, the scattering behavior of SWCNHs shows little dependence on the nanohorn morphology (dahlia-like or bud-like). These results are very interesting to assess the SWCNH potential in different applications, like for example, their use as absorbing standard in biological tissue-simulating phantoms, for the calibration of noninvasive diagnostic optical devices. Moreover, SWCNH suspensions show good stability properties as confirmed by preliminary measurements we performed over a period of 1 year.|$|R

After 45 days the euthanasia procedure was done and the adhesions were evaluated in 2 ways: 1) classification in a grading system; 2) evaluation of the adhesion area, which was calculated by resection of the adhesions after dying with <b>Indian</b> blue <b>ink.</b> RESULTS: The classification in a grading system showed that Group III animals had less adhesions formation (P 0. 05). The severe complications (fistula, evisceration and obstruction), which were lethal, were not reduced by the latex coated material. CONCLUSION: Latex coated polypropylene causes fewer adhesion formations than polypropylene alone, although it does not diminish the severe early complications...|$|R

The effect of opaline mist was often repeated at Bessborough Gardens on account of the nearness to the river.|$|E
60|$|Among the {{earliest}} sketches from nature which Turner {{appears to have}} made, in pencil and <b>Indian</b> <b>ink,</b> when a boy of twelve or fourteen, it is very singular how large a proportion consists of careful studies of stranded boats. Now, after some fifteen years of conscientious labor, with the single view of acquiring knowledge of the ends and powers of art, I have come to one conclusion, which {{at the beginning of}} those fifteen years would have been very astonishing to myself--that, of all our modern school of landscape painters, next to Turner, and before the rise of the Pre-Raphaelites, the man whose works are on the whole most valuable, and show the highest intellect, is Samuel Prout. It is very notable that also in Prout's early studies, shipping subjects took not merely a prominent, but I think even a principal, place.|$|E
60|$|He {{drew from}} under the table a sheet of strangely scented yellow Chinese paper, the brushes, and slab of <b>Indian</b> <b>ink.</b> In cleanest, severest outline he had traced the Great Wheel with its six spokes, whose centre is the {{conjoined}} Hog, Snake, and Dove (Ignorance, Anger, and Lust), and whose compartments are all the Heavens and Hells, and all the chances of human life. Men say that the Bodhisat Himself first drew it with grains of rice upon dust, to teach His disciples the cause of things. Many ages have crystallized it into a most wonderful convention crowded with hundreds of little figures whose every line carries a meaning. Few can translate the picture-parable; there are not twenty {{in all the world}} who can draw it surely without a copy: of those who can both draw and expound are but three.|$|E
60|$|Water Colours and Dyes.--The pads most {{commonly}} used with office stamps are made of variously prepared gelatine, covered with fine silk to protect the surface, and saturated with an aniline dye. If the surface be touched, the finger is inked, and if the circumstances are all favourable, a good print may be made, but there is much liability to blot. The pad remains ready for use during many days without any attention, fresh ink being added at long intervals. The advantage of a dye over an ordinary water colour is, that it percolates the silk without any of its colour being kept back; while a solution of lampblack or <b>Indian</b> <b>ink,</b> consisting of particles of soot suspended in water, leaves all its black particles behind when it is carefully filtered; only clear water then passes through.|$|E

And yet, when {{you see in the}} shop windows a line engraving like this,[X] or this,[X] either of which contains, alone, as much work as fifty pages of the manuscript book, or fifty such drawings as mine, you look upon its effect as quite a matter of course,--you never say 'how wonderful' that is, nor consider how you would like to have to live, by producing anything of the same kind yourselves.|$|E

A small but stout table of teak, with a round top and gate legs, stands against the port wall between the door and the bookcase.

6000|$|Ink.--Excellent writing-ink {{may be made}} in the bush. The readiest way {{of making}} it is to blacken sticks in the fire and to rub them well in a spoonful of milk till the milk becomes quite black.

If pure water be used, instead of gum or glue and water, the writing will rub out very easily when dry, the use of the milk, gum, or glue being to fix it: anything else that is glutinous will serve as well as these. Strong coffee, and many other vegetable products, such as the bark of trees boiled in water, make a mark which is very legible and will not rub. Blood is an indifferent substitute for ink.

Except for my tread on the boards there was no sound in the place till I heard some one breathing heavily behind a screen. The priest slid back what had appeared to me a dead wall, and we found a very old priest half-asleep over his charcoal handwarmer. This was the picture. The priest in olive-green, his bald head, pure silver, bowed down before a sliding screen of white oiled paper which let in dull silver light. To his right a battered black lacquer stand containing the <b>Indian</b> <b>ink</b> and brushes with which he feigned to work. To the right of these, again, a pale yellow bamboo table holding a vase of olive-green crackle, and a sprig of almost black pine. There were no blossoms in this place. The priest was too old.

6000|$|... 96. There {{was another}} great {{difference}} between Turner and other men. In doing these drawings for the commonest publications of the day, {{and for a}} remuneration altogether contemptible, he never did his work badly {{because he thought it}} beneath him, or because he was ill-paid. There does not exist {{such a thing as a}} slovenly drawing by Turner. With what people were willing to give him for his work he was content; but he considered that work in its relation to himself, not in its relation to the purchaser. He took a poor price, that he might live; but he made noble drawings, that he might learn. Of course some are slighter than others, and they vary in their materials; those executed with pencil and <b>Indian</b> <b>ink</b> being never finished to the degree of those which are executed in color. But he is never careless. According to the time and means at his disposal, he always did his best. He never let a drawing leave his hands without having made a step in advance, and having done better in it than he had ever done before; and there is no important drawing of the period which is not executed with a total disregard of time and price, and which was not, even then, worth four or five times what Turner received for it.|$|E

Another seaman 'had, on {{the lower part of the}} right arm, the device of a sailor and a female; the man holding the Union Jack with a streamer, the folds of which waved over her head, and the end of it was held in her hand.

This tattooing was found still plain, below the discoloured outer surface of a mutilated arm, when such surface was carefully scraped away with a knife.

She was much more representative than the great Peter Ivanovitch. Stripped of rhetoric, mysticism, and theories, she was the true spirit of destructive revolution.

The epigrammatic saying that speech has been given to us for the purpose of concealing our thoughts came into his mind.

I have myself two careful drawings of some old seals, made by him for a local book on the antiquities of Whalley Abbey.

Sometimes upon separate sheets, sometimes {{in the margins of}} other compositions, and frequently at the end of letters received by him I found a curious abundance of queer little drawings, caricatures of his correspondents, burlesque renderings of occurrences, disrespectful sidenotes to grave and pregnant utterances, and the like.

The shot of a rifle loses its sharpness in the moist air, and its smoke moves in a tardy little cloud towards the green rise, coppice-topped, that makes a background for the falling rain.

60|$|The {{history of}} Dungannon House when Acacia Cottage, could we procure a correct record {{of all the}} ideas which [Picture: Chimney-piece] have passed through the human mind within its walls, {{respecting}} literature and art, would form a chronicle of singular interest. The late Mr. Hullmandel, well {{known as one of}} the most experienced and successful practitioners of lithography in England, resided here in 1839 and 1840, when he discovered a new process in his favourite art, by simple mental reasoning, upon the application of the process of copperplate aquatint to lithographic purposes. For this discovery—and it is one of considerable importance—he subsequently took out a patent, under the name of lithotint. Ever since the infancy of lithography, hundreds of persons connected with the art, beginning with its inventor himself, Senefelder, had endeavoured to produce impressions from stone of subjects executed with the brush, in the same manner as drawings are made with sepia, or <b>Indian</b> <b>ink.</b> And it was natural enough that artists should have made every effort to supersede the tedious and elaborate process by which alone a liquid could be rendered available for the purpose of drawing on stone. The mode of drawing technically called “the ink style,” consists merely of a series of lines, some finer, some thicker, executed on the white surface of the stone, with ink dissolved in water, by means of a fine sable or a steel pen, in imitation of an etching on copper. All attempts, however, at producing variety of tints, by using the ink thicker or thinner, failed,—the fainter lines either disappearing altogether, or printing as dark as thick ones. In every attempt made to use this ink as a wash, the result was still more disastrous, producing only one dirty mass of indistinctness, amid which the original drawing was scarcely to be traced. For twenty years did Mr. Hullmandel labour to attain some mode of printing drawings, made by a series of washes, with a brush, on stone, feeling this to be the great desideratum in the art. Lithographers in Germany, in France, and in this country, had pronounced it to be “utterly impossible;” when the idea suddenly flashed upon him, that, if he could effect a minute granulation of the ink, by treating it as a copperplate engraver would the ground of an aquatint plate, the relative strength of the different washes might be preserved. He hastened from Acacia Cottage to his printing-office in London, to put his theory into practice, and was rewarded by the most satisfactory results.|$|E
