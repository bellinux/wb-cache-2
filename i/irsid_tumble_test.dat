Inertial accelerometer packages {{have been the}} primary sensor used to measure model attitude to an accuracy of +/- 0. 01 deg as required for aerodynamic research. The calibration parameters of the accelerometer package are currently obtained from a seven-point <b>tumble</b> <b>test</b> using a simplified empirical approximation. The inaccuracy due to the approximation exceeds the accuracy requirement as the misalignment angle between the package axis and the model body axis increases beyond 1. 4 deg.

A model for predicting t₁₀ from a small diameter core material for any ore type is also presented. The ores studied are: Ok Tedi 1, Ok Tedi 2, Red Dome, Alcoa, and Broken Hill. Shape factor of the particles that varies with both the particle size and the ore type affects the abrasion characteristics. Abrasion process in a tumbling mill is described by two mechanisms namely (1) chipping, and (2) abrasion, occurring at different rates.

The abrasion phenomenon is independent of t₁₀° (t₁₀° is the ore-specific t₁₀ at 7 x 10 ⁻⁴ kWh/t <b>tumbling</b> <b>test</b> energy) and the shape factor.

The size of coal lumps can be reduced in ball mill tests by two mechanisms (a) volume breakage and/or (b) surface breakage. The degradation characteristics of both types of coal were the same but the rate of degradation was higher in South Blackwater coal than Ensham coal. There was a distinct difference for degradation rate between the three different sizes of South Blackwater coal in the partially-cushioned coal but the rate of degradation increased with tumbling time.

The effect of control position and movement upon the erect and inverted spin and recovery characteristics ae well as the effects of propellers, of stability flaps, and of various revisions to the design configuration have been determined for the normal fighter loading. The investigation also included spin recovery parachute, <b>tumbling,</b> and pilot-escape <b>tests.</b> For the original design configuration, with or without windmilling propellers, the recovery characteristics of the model were considered unsatisfactory. Increasing the maximum upward deflection of the ailavators from 45 deg to 65 deg resulted in greatly improved recovery characteristics. Dimensional revisions to the original airplane configuration, which satisfactorily improved the general spin and recovery characteristics of the model, consisted of: (1) a supplementary vertical tail 34 inches by 59 inches (full-scale) attached to a boom 80 inches aft of {{the trailing edge of}} the airplane in the plane of symmetry, (2) a large semispan undersurface spoiler placed along the airplane quarter-chord line and opened on the outboard side in a spin, or (3) two additional vertical tails 64 inches by 52 inches (full-scale) located at the tips of the ailavators. A satisfactory parachute arrangement for emergency spin recovery from demonstration spins was found to be an arrangement consisting of a 13. 3 -foot parachute attached by a 30 -foot towline to the arresting gear mast on the airplane and opened simultaneously with an 8 -foot parachute on the outboard end of the wing attached by a 3 -foot towline.

When the center of gravity is located at 24 percent of the mean aerodynamic chord and slats are extended and elevators are deflected full up, the airplane may tumble if given an external positive pitching moment. 3. The tumbling motion obtained will be readily terminated by deflecting the elevators full down so as to oppose the rotation. 4. The accelerations encountered during an established tumble may be dangerous to the pilot and, therefore, action should be taken to terminate a tumble immediately upon its inception. 5. Simultaneous opening of two wing-tip parachutes having diameters of 4 feet or larger and having drag coefficients of approximately 0. 7 will effectively terminate the tumble. 6.

Mechanisms of disintegration were evaluated using basket samples charged into LKAB's experimental blast furnace prior to quenching and dissection. Coke charged into basket samples were analysed with CSR/CRI tests and compared with treated coke from the blast furnace. Results from <b>tumbling</b> <b>tests,</b> chemical analyses of coarse and fine material, as well as light optical microscopy studies of original and treated coke have been combined and evaluated. The results indicate a correlation between the ash composition and the CSR values. Differences in {{the texture of the}} coke were noted with light optical microscopy, and a significant change in the coke texture during the CSR/CRI test conditions was found. The results suggest that the main reaction between coke and CO 2 took place in isotropic areas, which was especially pronounced in coke with a low CSR. Signs of degradation were apparent throughout the coke pieces that have undergone CSR/CRI testing, but were less observable in coke reacted in the blast furnace. The results indicate that reaction with CO 2 is generally limited by the chemical reaction rate in the CSR/CRI test, while in the blast furnace the reaction is limited by the diffusion rate. Coke degradation is therefore mostly restricted to the coke surface in the blast furnace. Godkänd; 2008; 20080822 (ysko...|$|R

Three of these tests were of the paper-and-pencil type while one was a physical performance test. The two standardized tests of spatial ability were the Guilford-Zimmerman Aptitude Survey - Part V and Part VI. Part V 1 titled Spatial Orientation, is weighted toward measuring spatial-relations factors. Part VI, titled Spatial Visualization, is weighted toward measuring visualization factors.

Model spin tests were conducted with and without simulated engine rotation. Tests without simulated engine rotation indicated two types of spins: one, a slightly oscillatory flat spin; and the other, a violently oscillatory spin. Tests with simulated engine rotation indicated that spins to the left were fast rotating and steep and those to the right were slow rotating and flat. The optimum technique for recovery is reversal of the rudder to against the spin and simultaneous movement of the ailerons to full with the spin followed by movement of the elevators to neutral after the spin rotation ceases. <b>Tumbling</b> <b>tests</b> made on the model indicated that although the Ryan X- 13 airplane will not tumble in the ordinary sense (end-over-end pitching motion), it may instead tend to enter a wild gyrating'motion.

An attempt should be made to stop this motion immediately by moving the rudder to oppose the rotation (left pedal), moving the ailerons to with the spin (stick right), and moving the stick forward after the spin rotation ceases to obtain flying speed for pullout.

40|$|Abstract In the {{existing}} JKMRC breakage testing method for AG/SAG mill modelling, ore is characterised using mainly high energy single impact tests. However, recent DEM {{studies have suggested}} that breakage in AG/SAG mills is mainly due to low energy repetitive (or multiple) collisions rather than single high energy impacts. Furthermore, several of the published AG/SAG ore hardness tests developed outside the JKMRC use laboratory tumbling mills to quantify the specific power required to grind the ore to a set product size. Comprehensive experiments were carefully designed using two mill diameters of 1. 1 and 0. 6 m to mimic the reported low energy repetitive impact breakage under low load conditions. The ore breakage characterisation parameters derived from high energy single impact tests were used to predict the low energy repetitive impact breakage behaviour. Significant bias {{has been shown to be}} associated with the traditional high energy single impact characterisation approach, suggesting an alternative method was required. An extensive experimental program with more than 1400 tests was conducted using a newly developed JKRBT (JKMRC Rotary Breakage Tester) device, gravity drop <b>test</b> and laboratory <b>tumbling</b> mills. Comprehensive data were collected and analysed to provide an understanding of low energy repetitive impact breakage of particles and high energy single impact breakage. Details of the experimental study and findings are presented in Chapter 5. A breakage characterisation model has been developed, which takes into account the various impact energy classes and their associated body breakage and surface breakage responses. The breakage conditions were analysed and used to derive two sets of impact breakage parameters (body breakage and surface breakage). These parameters were then combined using a procedure believed to account for the two key breakage modes in tumbling, and successfully applied to predict the breakage in the two laboratory tumbling mills. Chapter 6 presents the breakage modelling approach and results. Based on the understanding of different breakage modes, a novel particle breakage characterisation method for AG/SAG mill modelling has been proposed and validated. Different from the prior-art JKMRC approach in which the breakage tests are conducted at high energy single impact, the proposed method incorporates high energy single impact, low energy multiple impacts and a simplified <b>tumbling</b> <b>test.</b> Both breakage probability and degree of breakage are used to characterise the breakage behaviour of ores. The details of the new characterisation method can be found in Chapter 7. The studies conclude that • The JKRBT can be used to investigate rock breakage characteristics under single and repetitive impacts; • The breakage of rocks in tumbling mills (under very low load conditions) can be likened to the low energy JKRBT repetitive impact breakage. • The behaviour of particle breakage as observed in AG/SAG milling can be modelled using a combination of JKRBT and tumbling ore breakage characterization; • A methodology for ore breakage characterization for AG/SAG mill modelling has been proposed and validated using independent sets of ores samples...|$|R

The degradation of cokes after reaction and annealing was characterised using I-drum <b>tumbling,</b> tensile <b>testing,</b> ultra-micro indentation and X-ray diffraction. Both gasification and annealing decreased the mechanical strength of coke. Compared with annealing at 1 673 K, gasification at same temperature caused larger degradation for all three cokes, and the effect was more significant on more reactive coke. In the annealing process, degradation of the cokes occurred through the entire coke lump and resulted in both tensile strength and I-drum tumbling strength decreasing simultaneously. In the process of gasification under the blast furnace-like conditions, degradation took place through the whole piece of coke with high reactivity; however, the degradation of coke with low reactivity was more severe at the periphery than in the core and therefore gasification had a minimal effect on {{the core of the}} coke and its tensile strength, but had a much stronger effect on I* 600. Microstrength of coke decreased significantly with increasing annealing temperature. The change of microstrength of coke upon gasification, which occurred at relatively low temperatures, was marginal.

40|$|In {{blast furnace}} ironmaking, efforts {{are made to}} {{decrease}} the coke consumption mainly by increasing the pulverized coal injection rate. This will cause changes in in-furnace reduction conditions, burden distribution and demands on raw material strength, etc. In order to maintain stable operation and minimize material losses through the off-gas, {{it is important to}} understand fines generation and behaviour in the blast furnace. The strength and reactivity of coke at high temperature, measured by the Coke Strength after Reaction (CSR) and Coke Reactivity Index (CRI), have been studied. Mechanisms of disintegration were evaluated using basket samples charged into the LKAB Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF) prior to quenching and dissection. Coke charged into basket samples was analysed with CSR/CRI tests and compared with treated coke from the blast furnace. Results from <b>tumbling</b> <b>tests,</b> chemical analyses of coarse and fine material, as well as Light Optical Microscope (LOM) studies of original and treated coke have been combined and evaluated. The results indicate a correlation between the ash composition and CSR values. Differences in the texture of the coke were determined with LOM, and a change in the coke texture during the CSR/CRI test conditions was found. The results suggest that the main reaction between coke and CO 2 during the solution loss reaction took place in isotropic areas, which was especially pronounced in coke with a low CSR. Signs of degradation were apparent throughout the coke pieces that have undergone CSR/CRI testing, but were less observable in coke reacted in the blast furnace. The results indicate that the solution loss reaction was generally limited by the chemical reaction rate in the CSR/CRI test, while in the blast furnace the reaction is limited by the diffusion rate. Coke degradation is therefore mostly restricted to the coke surface in the blast furnace. At a later EBF campaign, off-gas dust and shaft fines were sampled during operation with different iron-bearing materials. EBF process data were used to evaluate the relationship between off-gas dust amounts and furnace conditions. Characterization was focused on fines from coke, iron-bearing materials and slag formers. The graphitization degree (Lc value) of coke taken out of the EBF shaft and coke in flue dust was determined in order to trace the fines generation position. The results showed that flue dust, mainly 0. 075 mm and consisted mainly of coke particles originating from the shaft. Solution loss in the shaft had a negligible effect on coke degradation and the coke particles which ended up in the flue dust were mainly derived from abrasion at low temperatures. Sludge consisted mainly of chemically formed spherical particles < 1 μm formed in the blast furnace high-temperature area and then precipitated from the ascending gas as the temperature decreased. The amount of alkali and SiO 2 in sludge increased with higher pulverized coal injection rates and flame temperatures, which confirmed that submicron spherical particles in sludge originated from the high-temperature area around the raceway. Theoretical critical particle diameters of materials, which could be blown out with the off-gas, were estimated. Flow conditions in the top of the shaft as well as the properties of fine particles in terms of size and density are important when outflow of mechanical dust, such as flue dust, is concerned. Low off-gas temperatures, and thus lower off-gas velocities, are desirable for blast furnace operation with low amounts of flue dust.

The total time requested is 3. 3 million Jpsi-equivalent core-hours on the Fermilab clusters. 1 1 Physics goals Gauge theories with groups other than SU(3), or with light fermions in representations higher than the fundamental, are a staple of theories that go beyond the Standard Model. Among the mechanisms proposed to connect these theories to the Standard Model at low energies are technicolor and tumbling, with many associated variants. Both of these depend largely on weak-coupling pictures for their dynamics: a perturbative β function to take technicolor from weak to strong coupling as the energy scale drops, and a most-attractive-channel argument for scale separation and selection of the condensed channel in <b>tumbling.</b> Nonperturbative <b>tests</b> of these pictures, long overdue, have appear {{only in the last}} four years—for reviews, see [1 – 3]. In the past four years we have carried out a program of lattice studies of theories with SU(N) gauge fields and fermions in the two-index symmetric representation of the gauge group [4 – 9]. A gauge theory’s beta function can be negative (as in QCD) or positive (as in QED), or it can have a zero that is an infrared-attractive fixed point (IRFP). Theories with IRFPs are said to reside within a “conformal window ” in the (Nc,Nf) plane, wherein the IR physics displays conformal invariance and no particle spectrum. Just outside the conformal window, there might be a borderland where the beta function approaches zero without actually crossing it; this would give candidates for “walking technicolor, ” where the running coupling comes to a near-standstill for many decades in the energy scale, until chiral symmetry breaking eventually sets in.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In an {{ironmaking}} {{blast furnace}} solid-gas reactions {{are important and}} the rate of iron production is strongly dependent on the permeability of the particulate bed. In this regards coke is probably the most important component in the bed as it remains a solid even at very high temperatures. All the iron-bearing particles in the bed have reacted and melted at these temperatures. Blast furnace productivity is believed to greatly depend on the properties of the coke particles in the bed – in particular its ability to degrade under the conditions experienced in a blast furnace. The suitability of coke for use in blast furnace is characterised by tests conducted on the charged coke under room temperature and also after reaction at high temperatures. At the BHP Billiton Newcastle Technology Centre a large fundamental research program commenced in 2004 to understand the relationship between coal blend properties and coke properties, and also between coke properties and blast furnace performance. The work reported in this thesis is part of the research program. The work uses coke samples manufactured in a pilot oven under carefully controlled conditions, 2 D image analysis techniques developed to characterise the fundamental structural properties of coke and proven methods to determine the material composition of coke or its petrographic composition. The work in this thesis is aimed at determining the relationship between coke fundamental properties (i. e., its structure and petrographic composition) and its contact strength since coke particles degrade in the blast furnace through inter-particle contact. Currently, coke strength is determined using <b>tumble</b> <b>tests</b> to provide a bulk measure of its resistance to degradation. In this study two techniques were applied to determine coke strength. The first involved macro-indentation to obtain a fundamental measure of coke contact strength. The second involved the uni-axial compression of a bed of coke particles. At the inter-particle contact points fines are generated and the energy utilised in the generation of these fines was determined. The two tests are related in that a material which is penetrated more easily by an indenter will generate more fines because a larger volume of material has been fractured during the indentation process. Cokes from coking programs were used to assist {{in the development of a}} theoretical relationship or model. These cokes were termed model cokes because for each program the changes in coke properties were incremental – for example, cokes produced from a coal aged for varying periods formed cokes of similar petrographic compositions but with different structures. These model cokes were then characterised in terms of structural analysis and petrographic composition, and contact strength and energy utilisation. This allowed the influence of coke structure and petrographic composition on fundamental contact strength and energy utilised during inter-particle contact fracture to be studied. Many coke structural parameters are obtained using 2 D image analysis. This work considered which of these parameters were relevant to coke contact strength. The study then explored the use of a single index to describe the petrographic composition of coke relevant to contact strength. A novel SP (structure-petrographic) index was then obtained by combining the petrographic index with those structural parameters found to be relevant to coke contact strength. The theoretical model which gave good fit to measured results for the model cokes incorporates porosity, pore size, mean wall thickness for the structural term, while the petrographic index takes into consideration the volumetric composition of the components that make up the coke wall and the micro-hardness of these components. The model was then tested against cokes of very different properties. Not surprisingly, there was deterioration in the coefficient of correlation but there is still a clear relationship between the SP index and measured contact strength and energy utilisation. These studies indicate that the SP index gives a meaningful measure of coke contact strength. The traditional coke tumble strength incorporates other factors such as fissuring and breakage by other mechanisms; it is, therefore, not surprising that there is no relationship between the SP index and tumble strength. The reactions that occur in a blast furnace greatly weaken the structure of coke, leading to accelerated degradation. At BHP Billiton there is project underway to study the strength of reacted cokes. The macro-indentation test developed in this work was also used to measure the contact strength of some reacted cokes. Results were very promising and this test will be adopted in the study. Plans are also underway to use the uni-axial bed compression test and a modified SP index for reacted cokes...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} review {{on the relationship}} between the textural properties and mechanical properties of rock aggregates indicates that most studies investigated the relationship in two separate processes, i. e. microscope observations and mechanical tests, and then correlate the mechanical properties with one of textural properties indirectly using various regression models. Samples of three granites with similar mineral content but varying mechanical properties are investigated by microscope texture quantification including image analysis followed by rock mechanics testing and rock aggregate testing in the laboratory. Computer simulation of rock mechanics properties, of strength of single aggregate particles and fracture of multiple particles in a cylindrical chamber (DSC test) is then made. Finally computer simulations are compared of with <b>tumbling</b> mill <b>tests</b> (LA test) through results from previous research. This study uses numerical modelling as a main tool to directly investigate the relationships, i. e. from the physical mechanisms' point of view and taking major textural properties into consideration. Two main modelling methods, i. e. microstructural modelling and micromechanical modelling are implemented. In the microstructural modelling, the numerical simulation model is built on the basis of rock microstructure. In the micromechanical modelling, the model is constructed {{on the basis of the}} Weibull theory. The modelled results from single particle tests of three granites, i. e. Ävja, LEP and Vändle under BTS, point-to-point, plane-to-plane, point-to-plane and multiple-point loading conditions using microstructural modelling and micromechanical modelling show that Ävja is weaker than LEP and Vändle in terms of the aggregate tensile strength and applied work. The microstructural modelling also reveals that LEP is weaker than Vändle but the micromechanical modelling indicates that LEP and Vändle have similar mechanical properties. From this work it is concluded that microscope texture quantification and computer simulation is a promising approach to analyse mechanical properties of rock aggregates. Numerical modelling of the DSC test shows the potential to simulate multi particle chamber compression tests for assessment of rock aggregate quality. In general, the texture properties work together to influence the mechanical properties of rock aggregates. Computer simulation using a heterogeneous material model provides a valuable tool to investigate the relationship between the textural properties and mechanical properties of rock aggregates by taking main textural properties into consideration. In particular, for the three rocks in this study, micro crack size distribution, grain perimeter and grain size show strong correlations with the mechanical properties, e. g. for DSC strength: cracks and grain size negatively affect the mechanical properties but the perimeter positively influences the mechanical properties.

40|$|Powders are {{important}} commodities across different industries, {{such as the}} food and pharmaceutical industries. In these industries, powders are usually made, mixed, milled, packaged, and stored; these operations require the powders to move and flow under desired conditions and different stress levels. Failure to flow will cause hindrances to production; therefore knowledge of powder flow or flowability is important. There is a constant demand for accurate, reliable, and robust measurement and characterization methods for powder flowability. Powders behave differently under varying conditions; the behaviour of a powder is influenced by particle size distribution, and powder handling and processing conditions. There is to date no one “standard” method to characterize powder flowability; {{it is common to}} use a variety of methods and devices to measure flow properties and provide insight into the behaviour and flow characteristics of powders under different conditions. The flow properties of model food and mineral powders were measured and assessed by shear testing, compression via tapping, fluidization, and powder <b>tumbling.</b> Shear <b>testing</b> was done with an annular shear cell following Jenike (1964) and Berry, Bradley and McGregor (2014). Compression via tapping was performed according to a procedure in the dairy industry (Niro, 1978) and the European Pharmacopoeia (Schüssele & Bauer-Brandl, 2003). Fluidization was used to measure powder bed expansion and bed collapse following the powder classification framework provided by Geldart and co-workers (Geldart, 1973; Geldart, Harnby, & Wong, 1984; Geldart & Wong, 1984, 1985). Powder tumbling was performed in a novel Gravitational Displacement Rheometer, GDR, which measured the motion and avalanche activity of powders that moved under their own weight when rotated in a cylinder at different drum speed levels. The flow data from each characterization method were evaluated individually with regards to particle size distribution and then assessed collectively. The findings presented and discussed include the i) demonstration of the dominant influence of surface-volume mean particle diameter on powder flow properties, ii) characterization of flowability based on Jenike’s arbitrary flow divisions, iii) development of new correlations for the estimation of powder cohesion and bulk density at low preconsolidation stresses, iv) demonstration of hopper outlet diameter as a measure of flowability, v) demonstration of the limited utility of Hausner ratio as a flowability index, vi) substantiation of von Neumann ratio as a sensitive and useful indicator for identifying the onset of bubbling in fluidized beds using bed pressure fluctuation data, and vii) demonstration of the utility of standard deviation of the GDR load cell signal as an indicator of powder avalanche activity. These findings provide improved understanding and knowledge of powder flowability; they can be used to assist and facilitate the development of new techniques and solutions relevant to the handling and processing of powders especially in the food and pharmaceutical industries...|$|R
40|$|Dust from mining {{activities}} is produced from several unit operations {{and is often}} a serious problem to the industry, due to the influence it can have on {{human health and the}} safety record and productivity of a mine. So far, legislative parties and the industry have approached dust as an issue that needs to be controlled, only when a mining operation or process generates undesirable particulates. Nevertheless, new legislation and standards, such as the EU IPPC directive (Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control) and air quality strategies aim to drive mining companies to incorporate dust assessment planning that will be implemented through the whole life cycle of the mine. Mitigation and monitoring practices as well as health surveillance programs will need to be clearly defined. This project’s purpose is to understand how mining processes and in particular how the mechanisms inherent within common unit operations (i. e transfer processes using haulage roads or conveyor belts, the tipping, loading and stockpiling process, the screening process etc) result in the generation of dust. If the operation of unit operations could by optimized to produce less dust, then a “fit-for-purpose” strategy for dust minimisation could be developed to follow exploitation, processing and production demand. The literature on dust from mining operations identified that generation of fines/dust occurs due to the presence of the mechanisms of abrasion and impact. Based on this logic, an experimental methodology was developed, which aimed to assess how dust was generated for each different mechanism and for a variety of ores of different mineralogy. Five different ores were tested, a limestone, talc, an iron ore, a lamproite and a copper ore and the same experimental methodology was followed for each. Experimentation using the HSE-WSL <b>tumbling</b> mill <b>test</b> determined that under the effect of abrasion, ores yielded higher dustiness values during longer tumbling times, whilst parameters such as the sample mass and the particle size distribution of the feed sample could also influence the dust generation patterns. The findings of the computational modelling (discreet element modelling) and experimentation (high speed video recording) suggested that control and optimisation of operational parameters (e. g mill velocity, or tumbling time) within processes that involve abrasion, {{such as the use of}} conveyor belts, mills, and screens could minimise the potential of dust generation by this mechanism. The use of a novel impact test determined a positive relationship between the energy input and the particle size distributions of the broken particles, as well as the accumulation of fine particulates in the range of dust (< 75 μm). Also an increase in the bulk volume of ores resulted in larger quantities of fine particulates. These observations suggest that it is possible to reduce dust in processes that involve drop from heights and impaction (i. e transfer points in conveyor belts, tipping, loading) by adjusting the energy input and the bulk volume of ore at impact to as low a level possible. Particle size analysis of the produced dust fractions were found to be material dependent and varied considerably for the different ores. Almost all materials produced significant amounts of ultra fine particles below 10 μm and 2. 5 μm, both under impact and abrasion, which reveals the potential adverse impacts to the environment and human health. Quantitative mineralogical analysis using the mineral liberation analyser determined that the dust fraction presents a different composition to that of the ore. Comparison of the results collected for the five different ores using the HSE-WSL mill and the impact test identified that certain materials yielded high dust levels under abrasion and low under impact. Therefore it would be expected that dust control approaches for such materials would differ according to the mechanisms of the involved process and the mineralogy of the sample. According to the findings of this study a reduction in dust produced from mining unit operations could be possible by optimising the involved processes either by altering their operating parameters (drop height during tipping, velocity of conveyor belt) or by optimising the design of processes so as to reduce abrasion or impact. New legislation such as the EU IPPC directive has already started considering such an approach as important, and newly developed Best Available Techniques documents refer to this as the primary step companies should follow to minimise dust. Additional advantages of this approach are that it can reduce cost for dust control by making use of less conventional mitigation practices, and in the long term it could also minimise the utilization of energy and water going to suppression, extraction and dust collection systems. In certain cases the proposed route could also optimise the production chain, especially where the generation of fines is undesirable (e. g iron ore processing or aggregates production) ...|$|R
