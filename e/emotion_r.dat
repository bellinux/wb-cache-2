40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 19 studies (N = 15, 992 offenders) {{showed a significant}} inverse relation between more mature moral development and recidivism. Moderator analyses revealed a larger effect size for moral cognition (r =. 20) than for moral <b>emotion</b> (<b>r</b> =. 11). Effect sizes for production measures (r =. 57) were much larger than for recognition measures (r =. 16) and unstructured (clinical) judgment (r =. 10). Larger effect sizes were found for female delinquents (r =. 32) than for male delinquents (r =. 21). Only small differences in effect sizes were found between juvenile delinquents (r =. 10) and adult delinquents (r =. 16). Finally, self-report measures of recidivism revealed much larger effect sizes (r =. 32) than official reports of recidivism (r =. 09).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the depression and coping strategies used by postnatal mothers during the postpartum period. This study used cross-sectional design and was conducted at the University Malaya Medical Centre from November 2013 to January 2014. This study involved 150 respondents (postnatal mothers) and used instrumentation adopted from the Malay version of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Malay version of Brief COPE. The results showed 32 (21. 3 %) postnatal mothers have had severe depression. Emotional coping strategies were reported to be the most used by postnatal mothers (mean = 4. 77 ± 0. 70). There was a significant association between problem-focused coping strategies and race (p= 0. 045) where it was mostly used by Malay participants (mean = 3. 39 ± 0. 46). There was a mild negative relation between EPDS and problem focus (r=- 0. 168, p= 0. 04). On the other hand, there was a mild positive relation between depression level and avoidant <b>emotion</b> (<b>r</b> = 0. 162, p= 0. 047).

40|$|The {{relation}} between dispositional optimism and better adjustment to diverse stressors may {{be attributable to}} optimism's effects on coping strategies. A meta-analytic review (K = 50, N = 11, 629) examined the impact of dispositional optimism on coping. Dispositional optimism {{was found to be}} positively associated with approach coping strategies aiming to eliminate, reduce, or manage stressors or <b>emotions</b> (<b>r</b> =. 17), and negatively associated with avoidance coping strategies seeking to ignore, avoid, or withdraw from stressors or <b>emotions</b> (<b>r</b> =-. 21). Effect sizes were largerfor the distinction between approach and avoidance coping strate-gies than for that between problem and emotion-focused coping. Meta-analytic findings also indicate that optimists may adjust their coping strategies {{to meet the demands of}} the stressors at hand, and that the optimism-coping relationship is strongest in English-speaking samples. A large-and growing-body of evidence demon-strates that expectancies about the future impact well-being in the present. People who are dispositionally optimistic, that is, they have generally positive expec-tancies for the future, typically report less distress across a broad range of situations, including stressful situations (Andersson, 1996). Dispositional optimism is associated with better psychological adjustment to stressors ranging from normative events such as enter-ing college to extreme traumas such as working at the site of an airplane crash (Aspinwall & Taylor, 1992...|$|R

Subjects were children hospitalised for chemotherapy. To examine construct validity: (1) a priori expected relations between CHQ concepts and HUI attributes were examined; (2) HUI and CHQ summary scores were compared to visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. Ease of completion was rated using a 5 -point categorical scale and completion time was recorded. A total of 36 subjects were included. The maximum score was seen in 15 (47 %) of HUI 3 assessments. As predicted, CHQ body pain was moderately correlated with HUI 3 pain (r 0. 51), CHQ physical functioning was moderately correlated with HUI 2 mobility (r 0. 58) and CHQ mental health was moderately correlated with HUI 2 <b>emotion</b> (<b>r</b> 0. 53). Only the CHQ psychosocial subscale (and not HUI) was correlated with VAS (r 0. 44). The CHQ and the HUI were both easy to use.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of pain on quality of life of patients with diabetic foot syndrome. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Quality of life was assessed using a Czech version of the Diabetic Foot Ulcer Scale (DFS), a standardized questionnaire. The sample consisted of 247 patients with diabetic foot syndrome. The intensity of pain in diabetic ulcers was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain). Data was collected between April 2014 and December 2014 in 18 podiatric and chronic wound outpatient clinics throughout the Czech Republic. Results: Quality of life in patients with permanent pain was lower in all domains of the DFS questionnaire in comparison with patients who reported no pain. For patients who attended chronic wound outpatient clinics quality of life was significantly lower in four domains of the DFS (Leisure, Physical health, Emotions, and Friends) than for patients who did not attend chronic pain outpatient clinics. A statistically significant moderate negative correlation was found between intensity of pain and quality of life in the following domains: Physical health (r = - 0. 592), Daily activities (r = - 0. 456), <b>Emotions</b> (<b>r</b> = - 0. 503), and Treatment (r = - 0. 434).

40|$|This review {{builds on}} {{self-control}} theory (Carver & Scheier, 1998) {{to develop a}} theoretical framework for investigating associations of implicit theories with self-regulation. This framework conceptualizes self-regulation in terms of 3 crucial processes: goal setting, goal operating, and goal monitoring. In this meta-analysis, we included articles that reported a quantifiable assessment of implicit theories and at least 1 self-regulatory process or outcome. With a random effects approach used, meta-analytic results (total unique N 28, 217; k 113) across diverse achievement domains (68 % academic) and populations (age range 5 – 42; 10 different nationalities; 58 % from United States; 44 % female) demonstrated that implicit theories predict distinct self-regulatory processes, which, in turn, predict goal achievement. Incremental theories, which, in contrast to entity theories, are characterized by the belief that human attributes are malleable rather than fixed, significantly predicted goal setting (performance goals, r. 151; learning goals, r. 187), goal operating (helpless-oriented strategies, r. 238; mastery-oriented strategies, r. 227), and goal monitoring (negative <b>emotions,</b> <b>r.</b> 233; expectations, r. 157). The effects for goal setting and goal operating were stronger in the presence (vs. absence) of ego threats such as failure feedback.

Participants were 104 classical dancers (81 females and 23 males) {{ranging in age}} from 15 to 35 years (mean 19. 4 years; SD 3. 8 years) from three professional ballet companies, two private dance schools, and two university dance courses in Australia. Participants completed the Modified COPE scale and the Sport Anxiety Scale. Trait anxiety scores, in particular for somatic anxiety and worry, were significant predictors of 7 of the 12 coping strategies (wishful thinking, r 2 = 42. 3 %; selfblame, r 2 = 35. 7 %; suppression of competing activities, r 2 = 27. 1 %; venting of <b>emotions,</b> <b>r</b> 2 = 23. 2 %; denial, r 2 = 17. 7 %; effort, r 2 = 16. 6 %; active coping, r 2 = 14. 3 %). Approximately 96 % of dancers could be classified correctly as high or low trait-anxious from their reported coping style. No significant effects of gender or status (professional versus students) were found. Findings showed that high trait-anxious athletes tend to use more maladaptive, emotion-focused coping strategies compared with low trait-anxious athletes; a tendency that has been proposed to lead to negative performance effects.

40|$|Sexual {{harassment}} {{is associated with}} negative consequences for victims and bystanders. Because 9 in 10 victims do not report harassment, understanding bystanders' reactions to sexual {{harassment is}} important. Thus, my dissertation?s purpose was to advance the literature by analyzing bystanders' responses to sexual harassment by means of three studies. In Study 1, I examined bystanders' preferred punishment {{as a function of}} the harassment type and organizational culture. Participants were undergraduates (N= 107) enrolled in physical activity classes at a Southwestern United States university (males n= 53, 50 %, females n= 53, 50 %; largely Caucasian n= 79, 74. 5 %; age M= 21. 61, SD= 2. 70). The results indicate that harassment type affected bystanders' punishment preferences (B=. 55, p< 0. 01). While the workplace culture did not directly affect punishment preferences (B=-. 06, p= 0. 49), it moderated the relationship between harassment type and preferred punishment (R 2 =. 03, B=. 31, p< 0. 05) such that quid-proquo harassment in proactive organizations resulted in the harshest punishment recommendations. In Study 2, I analyzed bystanders' reactions to different punishment levels delivered to the harasser. Participants were undergraduates (N= 122) enrolled in activity classes at a Southwestern United States university (males n= 68, 56. 2 %, females n= 53, 43. 8 %; largely Caucasian n= 94, 77. 7 %; age M= 20. 00, SD= 2. 00). The results revealed that congruity, or lack thereof, between their preferred punishment and the actual punishment affected their negative <b>emotions</b> (<b>R</b> 2 = 0. 04, B=- 0. 30, p< 0. 01), organizational justice perceptions (R 2 = 0. 11, B= 0. 47, p< 0. 01), and cultural consistency beliefs (R 2 = 0. 02, B= 0. 19, p< 0. 05). In Study 3, I investigated bystanders? responses to different harassment levels as influenced by the organizational culture. Participants were undergraduates (N= 183) enrolled in activity classes at a Southwestern United States university (males n= 113, 61. 7 %, females n= 66, 36. 1 %; largely Caucasian n= 132, 72. 1 %; age M= 19. 84, SD= 1. 37). The results indicated that the harassment severity was positively associated with bystanders' intentions to intervene (B=. 32, p< 0. 001). The type of organizational culture did not affect willingness to act (B=-. 07, p= 0. 32), possibly given the personal investment required by taking action. Alternatively, personal characteristics (i. e., political views) may supersede environmental influences. Collectively, these findings reiterate literature documenting harassment types? differential severity. Also, they outline additional advantages to promoting a proactive organizational culture. Finally, the influence of individual and environmental factors in decision making is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{dealt with}} the question how members of relative advantaged groups experience inter-group inequality in terms of emotions. In bringing together research on social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979), relative deprivation theory (e. g., H. J. Smith & Kessler, 2004), and theory of group-based <b>emotions</b> (E. <b>R.</b> Smith, 1993, 1999), it has been reasoned that there are {{different ways in which}} the relative advantaged experience inequality. It was assumed that emotions serve as explanations of whether the advantaged are likely to promote or hinder social change. Five studies manipulated the dimensions of focus and legitimacy (cf. Leach, Snider, & Iyer, 2002) to distinguish the group-based emotions of pride, existential guilt, pity, and sympathy about inter-group inequality: As predicted, pride was especially intense when in-group advantage was legitimate, whereas existential guilt was most intense when in-group advantage was illegitimate. Sympathy was most intense when outgroup disadvantage was illegitimate; the results for pity, however, were mixed. The strongest findings concerning behavioral tendencies were found for pride and sympathy: The more intense pride was, the more the advantaged tried to affirm inequality. By contrast, sympathy motivated support of the disadvantaged and the challenge of inequality. These results show the specificity of emotions experienced about inter-group inequality...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{genome-wide}} association study (GWAS) {{identified a}} significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for trait-positive <b>emotion</b> at <b>rs</b> 322931 on chromosome 1, {{which was also}} associated with brain activation in the reward system of healthy individuals when observing positive stimuli in a {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) study. In the current study, we aimed to further validate the role of variation at rs 322931 in reward processing. Using a similar fMRI approach, we use two paradigms that elicit a strong ventral striatum (VS) blood oxygen-level dependency (BOLD) response in a sample of young, healthy individuals (N = 82). In the first study we use a similar picture-viewing task to the discovery sample (positive 4 neutral stimuli) to replicate an effect of the variant on emotion processing. In the second study we use a probabilistic reversal learning procedure to identify reward processing during decision-making under uncertainly (reward 4 punishment). In a region of interest (ROI) analysis of the bilateral VS, we show that the rs 322931 genotype was associated with BOLD in the left VS during the positive 4 neutral contrast (PROI-CORRECTED = 0. 045) and during the reward 4 punishment contrast (PROI-CORRECTED = 0. 018), although the effect of passive picture viewing was in the opposite direction from that reported in the discovery sample. These findings suggest that the recently identified GWAS hit may influence positive emotion via individual differences in activity in the key hubs of the brain’s reward system. Furthermore, these effects may not be limited to the passive viewing of positive emotional scenes, but may also be observed during dynamic decisionmaking. This study suggests that future studies of this GWAS locus may yield further insight into the biological mechanisms of psychopathologies characterised by deficits in reward processing and positive emotion...|$|R
5000|$|Many psychologists {{reject the}} notion that men {{actually}} experience emotions less frequently than do women. Instead, researchers have suggested that men exhibit restrictive emotionality. Restrictive emotionality refers to a tendency to inhibit the expression of certain emotions and an unwillingness to self-disclose intimate feelings. Men's restrictive emotionality {{has been shown to}} influence health, emotional appraisal and overall identity. Furthermore, tendencies toward restrictive emotionality are correlated with an increased risk of certain anxiety disorders.A substantial amount of research has suggested that women do, on average, express emotions more frequently than men. In the Handbook of <b>Emotions,</b> Leslie <b>R.</b> Brody and Judith A. Hall report that This difference in emotional expression starts at a young age, as early as 4 and 6 years old, as girls begin to express more sadness and anxiety than their male counterparts. Brody and Hall (2008) report that women generally smile, laugh, nod and use hand gestures more than men do. [...] The only known exception to this rule is that men more frequently express anger. However, all of these effects are not commonly observed until after preschool, suggesting that these differences might be the result of certain socialization processes. Women are also more accurate expressers of emotion, when [...] "posing deliberately and when observed unobstrusively." [...] This increased expressiveness in emotional expression is consistent across cultures - women report more intense emotional experiences and more overt emotional expressions across 37 cultures.It has been found that men and women more accurately display gender-stereotypic expressions - men more accurately express anger, contempt and happiness, while women were more accurately express fear and happiness. [...] Other studies have shown that women show higher levels of expression accuracy and judgement of nonverbal emotional cues than men overall. However, these patterns are not consistent across cultures, again suggesting that socialization influences the observed gender differences in emotional expression. [...] For example, in Japan, research has suggested that women convey anger and contempt better than men do.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patients with {{fibromyalgia}} {{have shown}} hyporeactive {{autonomic nervous system}} (ANS) responses to physical stressors, augmented pain to ANS changes, and heightened negative emotions, which can increase pain. This study examined ANS reactivity to negative emotions and its association with pain in fibromyalgia and control participants. METHODS: Sixty-two women with fibromyalgia and 59 women in a control group recalled neutral, and anger- and sadness-eliciting experiences while ANS activity was monitored. Clinical and experimental pain were assessed in response to each emotion. RESULTS: Compared with neutral recall, heart rate (p =. 050), mean arterial pressure (p . 29). Among patients only, decreased preejection period (anger-pain threshold: r = 0. 31, p =. 018) and total peripheral resistance in response to negative <b>emotions</b> (anger-pain tolerance: <b>r</b> = 0. 35, p =. 025; sadness-pain threshold: r = 0. 51, p <. 001; sadness-pain tolerance: r = 0. 61, p <. 001) correlated with more pain. CONCLUSIONS: These {{data suggest that the}} ANS is not hyporesponsive to elicited emotions in fibromyalgia; however, patients with a larger pain response showed an ANS response pattern reflecting heightened beta-adrenergic and reduced alpha-adrenergic reactivity. Future research should test whether a specific ANS response pattern to emotions is a consequence of increased pain or whether it amplifies pain...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Many adults {{experience}} poor sleep quality, {{and personality}} traits {{have emerged as}} important predictors of self-reported sleep. However, it is still unclear whether personality predicts sleep quality independent of other correlates, including mood, emotion regulation, and hyperarousal. Aims and method: The {{aim of this study}} was twofold. First, using an online survey, we assessed the relationship between perceived sleep quality (defined here as the total score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and personality in 498 Italians (M age = 26. 6. ±. 7. 4 years, 353 Female). Second, using multiple regressions, we investigated whether this association was independent of affect, emotion regulation strategies, and hyperarousal. Results: Results replicate previous findings, showing that neuroticism is the best personality predictor of sleep quality in Italians. When examined separately, hyperarousal explained the most variance in sleep quality (R 2 = 18), followed by personality traits (R 2 = 12), affect (R 2 = 12), and <b>emotion</b> regulation strategies (<b>R</b> 2 = 01). However, when all predictors were entered into a single regression model (R 2 = 20), only agreeableness, positive affect, and hyperarousal remained statistically significant. Conclusion: Overall, our data replicate the association between personality and perceived sleep quality in Italians, showing that neuroticism is the best predictor of worse sleep quality. Finally, we also demonstrate important roles for hyperarousal and positive affect, but not for emotion regulation strategies. Results have implications for applied research and interventions that may want to identify individuals at risk for poor sleep...|$|R
40|$|Suplemento de artículos seleccionados con revisión del Congreso Andaluz de Psicología de la Actividad Física y el Deporte (13 : 2011 : Sevilla). Editores : José Carlos Caracuel; Rocío Bohórquez. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the relationship among attributions in competition, perception of efficacy therein and emotions experienced. An ad-hoc emotions assessment inventory that contains 48 items with a Likert response system of 0 to 4, depending on the intensity of the emotion experienced, was used. Likewise, the attributions were measured using a closed item that covered these possible response options, using the locus axes of control and stability. Lastly, perceived self-efficacy was assessed using an item with four alternative responses. In both cases, we started out from these variables’ conceptual foundations to construct the items. The sample consisted in 60 athletes, footballers and karate practitioners with a mean age of 21. 87 years old. The results of the competitions perceived as successful showed significant differences in the positive emotions experienced (F = 5. 664, p =. 002), depending on the attributions made. Regarding efficacy, we found a positive correlation between pleasant <b>emotions</b> and self-efficacy (<b>r</b> =. 402, p =. 001) and a negative correlation between high arousal of unpleasant emotions (anger and fear) and self-efficacy (r =-. 263, p =. 043). All the relationships followed the direction of the conceptual framework of the underpinning motivational theories and also present some lines for the future...|$|R
500|$|In game seven at Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox held a 5–2 {{lead through}} seven innings {{due to an}} {{ineffective}} start by Roger Clemens, but the Yankees remained in the game because of three shutout innings of relief by Mike Mussina in his first career relief appearance. After Boston Red Sox starter Pedro Martínez gave up a run in the eighth, manager Grady Little visited the mound but elected to leave a tiring Martínez to complete the inning. Martínez then gave up a ground-rule double to Hideki Matsui, and Yankees catcher Jorge Posada blooped a double into center field that drove in two runners and tied the game. The game went into extra innings and {{in the bottom of}} the eleventh inning, leadoff hitter Aaron Boone, grandson of Ray Boone, a (retired) longtime scout with the Red Sox, hit a solo home run off of Tim Wakefield to left field, ending the game and the series, giving the Yankees their 39th American League pennant. The Long Island, New York, newspaper Newsday went to the press before the game was over, and thinking Boston would win the game, editorialized as to what was wrong with the Yankees, and why they had lost the ALCS to the Red Sox. In a postgame interview, Red Sox firstbaseman Kevin Millar described the <b>emotions</b> in the <b>Red</b> Sox locker room: [...] "It was like we were all back in high school, like we'd all just gotten beat in the state playoffs, and everyone was going to graduate.... When you're a teenager and you lose the big football game, that's when you see guys cry uncontrollably. You don't [...] see that much at this level." ...|$|R
40|$|Facial {{expressions}} and prosodic acoustic characteristics jointly present paralinguistic features of communication. By analyzing literature, we observe that respondents with intellectual disabilities manifest emphasized difficulties in detecting emotions in tasks of facial and vocal expression. However, {{we do not}} know if there are data on how paralinguistic abilities correlate with social skills in adults with intellectual disabilities. This research was conducted {{in order to determine the}} relation between the ability of paralinguistic production and paralinguistic understanding, on one side, and social skills on the other side. The sample consisted of 44 adults of both genders with mild (N= 22) and moderate intellectual disabilities (N= 22), aged between 20 and 50 (M= 32. 41, SD= 9. 36). The Paralinguistic scale from the battery for the assessment of communication (The Assessment Battery for Communication, Abaco, Sacco et al., 2008) was used for the assessment of paralinguistic skills, and three subscales of Vineland adaptive behavior scale - teaching form (Sparrow, Cicchetti & Balla, 2006) were used for the assessment of social skills. The results show that the achievement on subscales of Playing and leisure time positively correlated with the ability to understand <b>emotions</b> in communication (<b>r</b> = 0. 486, p < 0. 05) in respondents with mild intellectual disability. Achievements on the subscales Skills of adapting had a moderate and positive correlation with the ability to understand emotions in communication (r= 0. 522, p< 0. 05) in subjects with mild intellectual disability. Statistically significant correlations between the examined variables were not observed in the group of respondents with moderate intellectual disability. We can conclude that in adults with mild intellectual disability the ability to understand emotional paralinguistic elements significantly correlates with the ability to organize social activities and to adapt behavior in social interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to develop a measure of the Emotional Antecedents of Alcohol Use (EAAU) and {{investigate}} its psychometric properties. Focus groups and three pilot studies were conducted to develop and define the construct of alcohol consumption as a means of emotion regulation. Items were written based upon focus group results, existing published instruments, and a review of the literature. Independent raters evaluated the initial item pool for face validity and the initial EAAU was given to small pilot samples (N= 64, N= 39) to investigate initial internal consistency and content validity. Results of pilot studies suggested that the EAAU is a valid measure of alcohol consumption and positively associated with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; r = 0. 445, p 3 ̆c. 001; r = 0. 607, p 3 ̆c. 001). The EAAU was then administered to a larger sample (N= 301) to investigate the structure of the instrument. Exploratory factor analysis results implied that a 14 -factor model was the best fitting and most parsimonious and sufficient factor solution to represent the structure of the EAAU scores produced by the current sample. These 14 distinct emotional domains were interpreted as representing the following: (1) Relaxation, (2) Fear/Worry, (3) Reservation, (4) Negative High Arousal, (5) Shock, (6) Sedation, (7) Sadness, (8) Fatigue, (9) Anger, (10) Happiness, (11) Alertness, (12) Annoyance, (13) Serenity, and (14) Positive High Arousal. Results suggested the EAAU demonstrates convergent validity as small to moderate positive relationships were noted between the EAAU and measures of alcohol expectancies (r = 0. 374, p 3 ̆c. 001) and alcohol-related problems (r = 0. 292, p 3 ̆c. 001). Results supported marginal discriminant validity of the EAAU as negligible to small negative relationships were noted between the EAAU and a measure of self-esteem (r = - 0. 157, p =. 007). Additionally, the EAAU demonstrated initial evidence of predictive validity as EAAU subscale scores were found to be predictive of difficulties in <b>emotion</b> regulation (<b>R</b> 2 =. 128, F(14, 286) = 2. 991, p 3 ̆c. 001) and alcohol consumption (R 2 =. 111, F(14, 286) = 2. 539, p =. 002). Lastly, gender and drinker status differences in EAAU scores were found. Males (M= 267. 74, SD= 80. 07) were found to obtain higher EAAU scores (t(290) = - 2. 59, p =. 010) in comparison to women (M= 244. 47, SD= 73. 26), while problem drinkers (M= 281. 21, SD= 69. 81) were found to obtain higher EAAU scores (t(299) = 7. 459, p 3 ̆c. 001) in comparison to social drinkers (M= 218. 87, SD= 74. 61). Study limitations, implications, and future research directions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Families {{of people}} with eating {{disorders}} are often caught up in rule bound eating and safety behaviours that characterise the illness. The main {{aim of this study}} was to develop a valid and specific scale to measure family accommodation in the context of having a relative with an eating disorder. Methods A new scale, the Accommodation and Enabling Scale for Eating Disorders (AESED), was jointly generated by professionals and expert carers through qualitative analysis. In the first stage, this instrument was given to 201 family members of relatives diagnosed with an eating disorder, with additional self-report measures including the Experience of Caregiving Inventory (ECI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Family Questionnaire (FQ). In the second stage, the sensitivity of the AESED to change was tested in a pre-and-post design study with a new sample of 116 caregivers, using a DVDs-distance skills training for caregivers. Results A 33 item instrument was derived consisting of five factors: Avoidance and Modifying Routine, Reassurance Seeking, Meal Ritual, Control of Family and Turning a Blind Eye, which together explained 60. 1 % of the variance. This scale had good psychometric properties in terms of Cronbach's alpha which ranged from 0. 77 to 0. 92. Regarding the convergent validity, most of the AESED subscales was moderately supported by correlations with anxiety (HADS; r = 0. 24 to 0. 48) and depression levels (HADS; r = 0. 17 to 0. 47), negative caregiving (ECI; r = 0. 18 to 0. 45), and expressed <b>emotion</b> levels (FQ; <b>r</b> = 0. 17 to 0. 51). Pre-post intervention assessments showed that the overall AESED scale (d = 0. 38) and the avoidance and modifying routine (d = 0. 52), meal ritual (d = 0. 27) and control of the family (d = 0. 49) subscales were sensitive to change. Conclusion Internal consistency was good and initial validity of the scale was adequate, it was able to discriminate differences between clinical variables, however, further work is needed to confirm the factor structure and validity of the AESED. Nevertheless, this scale may be of value in exploring and helping to improve carers' coping strategies and in examining the effectiveness of family based interventions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Existing {{literature}} {{indicates that}} ADRB 2 gene {{is associated with}} health and longevity, but none of previous studies investigated associations of carrying the ADRB 2 minor alleles and interactions between ADRB 2 genotypes and social/behavioral factors(GxE) with health outcomes at advanced ages. This study intends to fill in this research gap. 				 				 					 						Method 					We conducted an exploratory analysis, using longitudinal survey phenotype/genotype data from 877 oldest-old aged 90 +. To estimate association of GxE interactions with health outcome, adjusted for the potential correlation between genotypes and social/behavioral factors and various other potentially confounding factors, we develop and test an innovative three-step procedure which combines logistic regression and structural equation methods. 				 				 					 						Results 					Interaction between regular exercise and carrying rs 1042718 minor allele is significantly and positively associated with good cognitive function; interaction between regular exercise and carrying rs 1042718 or rs 1042719 minor allele is significantly and positively associated with self-reported good health; and interaction between social-leisure activities and carrying rs 1042719 minor allele is significantly and positively associated with self-reported good health. Carrying rs 1042718 or rs 1042719 minor alleles is significantly and negatively associated with negative emotion, but the ADRB 2 SNPs are not significantly associated with cognitive function and self-reported health. Our structural equation analysis found that, adjusted for the confounding effects of correlation of the ADRB 2 SNPs with negative emotion, interaction between negative <b>emotion</b> and carrying <b>rs</b> 1042718 or rs 1042719 minor allele is significantly and negatively associated with cognitive function. The positive association of regular exercise and social-leisure activities with cognitive function and self-reported health, and negative association of negative emotion with cognitive function, were much stronger among carriers of rs 1042718 or rs 1042719 alleles, compared to the non-carriers. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					The results indicate significant positive associations of interactions between social/behavioral factors and the ADRB 2 genotypes with health outcomes of cognitive function and self-reported health, and negative associations of carrying rs 1042718 or rs 1042719 minor alleles with negative emotion, at advanced ages in China. Our findings are exploratory rather than causal conclusions. This study implies that near-future health promotion programs considering individuals&# 8217; genetic profiles, with appropriate protection of privacy/confidentiality, would yield increased benefits and reduced costs to the programs and their participants...|$|R
