The new design applies the heat flux sensor developed by our team as well [3], making easier the control of the device. This development allows even the realization of negative thermal resistances.

40|$|Flat or {{roof top}} {{mountings}} of PV systems require large area or land. Scarcity of land is greatest problem {{in cities and}} even in villages in India.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) antennas {{developed for}} different earth observation missions. Such missions often require Precise Orbit Determination (POD). The largest error contribution to POD measurements is usually local multipath, i. e. signals {{reflected in the}} satellite structure. Antenna radiation in the back direction must hence be suppressed, {{while at the same}} time keep a good coverage at low elevation angles. This is normally achieved by using a standard antenna element placed in a larger choke ring structure. The disadvantage with this arrangement is that the antenna becomes large and relatively heavy. The objective has hence been to develop small and lightweight antennas with low back radiation in combination with good coverage. We have worked with both low profile Patch Excited Cup (PEC), as well as helix antennas. Two of the described antennas are PEC antennas. One smaller, suitable on satellites without large <b>flat</b> <b>mounting</b> areas, and one design where the low elevation gain was traded against the back radiation and a good compromise was achieved using only two narrow choke rings to facilitate mounting on larger flat surfaces. A high-performance conical quadrifilar helix antenna has earlier been developed for applications where a taller antenna can be accommodated...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} corneal endothelial surface enlargement in the chicken myopia model in inducing corneal endothelial changes. Methods: Lid suture was performed on one eye of 1 -day-old cockerels. Five chickens were killed at 1 week, and four chickens killed at each of 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 10 weeks postnatal. The endothelial morphology was obtained by <b>flat</b> <b>mounting</b> the endothelial surface and the subsequent digitisation. Comparisons were undertaken between the control unsutured eye and the lid-sutured eye endothelium, and between the central endothelial areas compared to the peripheral endothelial areas in both the myopic and the normal corneas. Calculation of the contribution to the endothelial change by hypertrophy and mitosis were calculated using Bahn 2 ̆ 7 s formula. Results: Total endothelial surface area increased significantly over time in the myopic model compared to control eyes but the mean cell area of endothelial cells remained the same for both the enlarged myopic endothelial surface area and in the normal controls. Sampling from the central and the peripheral corneal endothelial surface also disclosed no difference. The mean cell area did increase steadily with age but was the same for both normal and myopic corneas. Conclusions: It would appear that there are equal contributions from hypertrophy and mitosis in the myopic group and the normal corneal group with a slightly increasing trend towards mitotic activity in the myopic corneal endothelial layer...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Curved-surface {{projection}} (CSP) is a {{new technique}} for visualizing functional MR imaging data. This technique helps in identifying anatomic structures by demonstrating the whole gyral and sulcal pattern of the brain at once. Compared with other techniques, CSP preserves the spatial relation of eloquent areas to lesions. Especially in neurosurgical patients with space-occupying lesions, CSP helps in assigning the anatomy to its function. Functional imaging is becoming more often used for presurgical planning and for guiding neurosurgeons during their interventions. Functional MR imaging (fMRI) can help improve {{our understanding of the}} anatomic relationship of a lesion to eloquent areas. This information might be used to optimize resection margins and to reduce the postoperative deficit. However, if a lesion distorts the brain surface or deep anatomy, making the right topographic assignment or understanding the anatomic relation of a lesion to eloquent areas often becomes difficult. Several approaches are used to display functional imaging results. These include overlaying fMRI results on orthogonally reformatted high-spatial-resolution T 1 -weighted images, projecting statistical maps onto three-dimensional (3 D) models of the rendered brain surfaces, and projecting flat-mounted maps. The first method is most widely used. However, in the case of large space-occupying or deep subcortical lesions, this kind of visualization often fails or requires interactive browsing through all three orthogonal views. Even the more advanced techniques, such as 3 D surface rendering and <b>flat</b> <b>mounting,</b> do not solve this problem entirely. We propose an alternative visualization method that has the potential to overcome these difficulties by displaying the gyral pattern as flat maps would do, yet preserve the spatial relationship of the eloquent areas to the lesions...|$|E
40|$|Radial peripapillary {{capillaries}} (RPCs) {{comprise a}} unique network of capillary beds within the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) {{and play a}} critical role in satisfying the nutritional requirements of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. Understanding the topographical and morphological characteristics of these networks through in vivo techniques may improve our understanding about the role of RPCs in RGC axonal health and disease. This study utilizes a novel, non-invasive and label-free optical imaging technique, speckle variance optical coherence tomography (svOCT), for quantitatively studying RPC networks in the human retina. Six different retinal eccentricities from 16 healthy eyes were imaged using svOCT. The same eccentricities were histologically imaged in 9 healthy donor eyes with a confocal scanning laser microscope. Donor eyes were subject to perfusion-based labeling techniques prior to retinal dissection, <b>flat</b> <b>mounting</b> and visualization with the microscope. Capillary density and diameter measurements from each eccentricity in svOCT and histological images were compared. Data from svOCT images were also analysed to determine if there was a correlation between RNFL thickness and RPC density. The results are as follows: (1) The morphological characteristics of RPC networks on svOCT images are comparable to histological images; (2) With the exception of the nasal peripapillary region, there were no significant differences in RPC density measurements between svOCT and histological images; (3) Capillary diameter measurements were significantly greater in svOCT images compared to histology; (4) There is a positive correlation between RPC density and RNFL thickness. The findings in this study suggest that svOCT is a reliable modality for analyzing RPC networks in the human retina. It may therefore be a valuable tool for aiding our understanding about vasculogenic mechanisms that are involved in RGC axonopathies. Further work is required to explore the reason for some of the quantitative differences between svOCT and histology...|$|E

40|$|The density, {{distribution}} and surface phenotype of dendritic cells (DC) and macrophage populations within the ciliary body and iris of Wistar Furth rats were studied {{by a combination}} of <b>flat</b> <b>mounting,</b> tangential sectioning, pre-embedding fixation, with a single and double immunohistochemical techniques. Monoclonal antibodies included anti-Ia (OX 6) and other dendritic cell/macrophage (ED 1 and ED 8) or mature tissue macrophage markers (ED 2). Single and double staining revealed a network (approximately 400 cells/mm 2) of Ia+ cells within the epithelium of the ciliary processes with the morphological and surface phenotypic characteristics of DC populations in other tissues. A minor proportion of DC co-expressed ED 1 and ED 8, but not ED 2. In contrast the immunopositive cells in the lamina propria displayed a more generalized phenotype, including ED 2 expression, and pleiomorphic morphology suggesting a preponderance of cells of macrophage lineage. Flat mounts of iris revealed a remarkably regular network of Ia+ DC at a density of 450 cells/mm 2. The network of DC in the ciliary epithelium terminated at the cilioretinal junction where they formed a continuous syncytium with retinal microglia which did not display Ia staining. The demonstration of networks of cells with relevant morphological and phenotypical properties of professional antigen-presenting cells at strategic locations within the eye has important implications in relation to ocular immune regulation and on the theories of the mechanism of anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID). Namely, until now it has been assumed that 'immune privilege' in the anterior chamber of the eye is partly a consequence of there being a paucity of class II+ cells in the surrounding tissues. Dendritic cells in the eye may function as antigen-presenting cells, sampling endogenous and exogenous intraocular antigens and possibly migrating from the eye to draining lymphoid organs (the spleen) where they may generate systemic immune responses. Equally dendritic cells could potentially regulate local immune responses for example in various forms of autoimmune uveoretinal inflammatory disease...|$|E

40|$|The {{zebrafish}} embryo is now {{commonly used}} for basic and biomedical research {{to investigate the}} genetic control of developmental processes and to model congenital abnormalities. During {{the first day of}} life, the zebrafish embryo progresses through many developmental stages including fertilization, cleavage, gastrulation, segmentation, and the organogenesis of structures such as the kidney, heart, and central nervous system. The anatomy of a young zebrafish embryo presents several challenges for the visualization and analysis of the tissues involved in many of these events because the embryo develops in association with a round yolk mass. Thus, for accurate analysis and imaging of experimental phenotypes in fixed embryonic specimens between the tailbud and 20 somite stage (10 and 19 hours post fertilization (hpf), respectively), such as those stained using whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH), it is often desirable to remove the embryo from the yolk ball and to position it flat on a glass slide.

40|$|Purpose: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is {{the leading}} cause of {{blindness}} in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This study evaluated the inhibitory effect of vasostatin (VS), an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, on CNV. Methods: Anti-angiogenic activity of VS was evaluated in vitro by migration and tube formation assays in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). CNV lesions were induced in Brown Norway rats by fundus argon laser photocoagulation. Beginning one day after CNV induction, rats were treated with eye drops containing 1 μg/ml VS in PBS buffer for three times daily for 20 days. The extent of CNV was examined by <b>flat</b> <b>mount</b> analysis on day 24 or by fundus fluorescein angiography (FAG) on days 21, 28, 35, and 42, respectively.

40|$|Aim: To {{demonstrate}} that interference microscopy of <b>flat</b> <b>mounted</b> internal limiting membrane specimens clearly delineates cellular proliferations at the vitreomacular interface. Methods: ILM specimens harvested during vitrectomy were fixed in glutaraldehyde 0. 05 % and paraformaldehyde 2 % for 24 h (pH 7. 4). In addition to interference microscopy, immunocytochemistry using antibodies against glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament (NF) was performed. After washing in phosphatebuffered saline 0. 1 M, the specimens were flat-mounted on glass slides without sectioning, embedding {{or any other}} technique of conventional light microscopy. A cover slide and 49, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) medium were added to stain the cell nuclei. Results: Interference microscopy clearly delineates cellular proliferations at the ILM. DAPI stained the cell nuclei. Areas of cellular proliferation can be easily distinguished from ILM areas without cells. Immunocytochemistry can be performed without changing the protocols used in conventional microscopy. Conclusion: Interference microscopy of <b>flat</b> <b>mounted</b> ILM specimens gives {{new insights into the}} distribution of cellular proliferations at the vitreomacular interface and allows for determination of the cell density at the ILM.
