40|$|Property rights {{reform is}} {{typically}} hypothesized to boost investment through investment demand and credit supply effects. Yet when the credit supply effect is muted, property rights reform {{would be expected}} to induce liquidity-constrained farms to reduce investment in <b>movable</b> <b>capital</b> even as they increase investment in attached capital. This expectation is corroborated by econometric analysis of panel data from Paraguay. While all farmers experience a positive investment demand effect, liquidity-constrained producers correspondingly reduce their demand for <b>movable</b> <b>capital.</b> Given an estimated pattern of wealth-biased liquidity constraints, property rights reform will get institutions “right” for only wealthier producers.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{property}} rights on investment are typically hypothesized to occur through a security-induced investment demand and a collateral-based credit supply. Using a two period model, this paper shows that for farms that are constrained in their access to liquidity, the investment demand effect will itself induce {{an increase in the}} endogenous shadow price of liquidity. Other things equal, this induced increase in the price of liquidity will discourage capital accumulation, and that the desired stock of expropriation-immune <b>movable</b> <b>capital</b> may decrease with tenure security. Empirical analysis of farm-level data from Paraguay corroborates this proposition and reveals that the underlying pattern of wealth-biased capital access creates a world in which property rights reform has differential effects across producer wealth classes and gets institutions "right" and agriculture moving for only for a wealthier subset of producers. ...|$|R

30|$|Actually, we {{distinguish}} between three {{different types of}} income: labour income, non-labour <b>income,</b> and transfers <b>from</b> the government.

Information on fringe benefits, severance and termination payments, and a company car is also available. Non-labour <b>income</b> covers <b>income</b> <b>from</b> the rental of property or land, interest, dividends, and profit from capital investments. Transfers involve pensions (old age and disability), means-tested benefits (such as the material needs benefit), contributory benefits (unemployment and maternity), and family-related benefits.|$|R

Contrary to previous studies this study takes the selection effect, i. e. the probability of having an <b>income</b> <b>from</b> work, into account when calculating the effect on <b>income</b> <b>from</b> work of a change in any of the explanatory variables. Our study shows that when the selection effect is taken into account, the differences in <b>income</b> <b>from</b> work between immigrants and natives are smaller than when the selection effect is not considered. We find that immigrants have a lower <b>income</b> <b>from</b> work than the native population when we control for variables such as schooling, experience, civil status and region of residence. Furthermore, immigrant cohorts with a recent year of immigration have a considerably lower <b>income</b> <b>from</b> work than earlier immigrant cohorts.
