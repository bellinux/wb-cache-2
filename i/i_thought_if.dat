25|$|I thought I {{would write}} Memories and the City in six months, {{but it took}} me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E

500|$|I {{love this}} song for many reasons. It had a {{different}} sound {{than a lot of}} my songs. I related to it personally more than other songs, and I have so much fun with it. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> it could be a single that it would be incredible to perform it all the time ... What stands out about the song [...] I can dance to it and rock out to it, which is ultimately my goal. I was just so excited when I heard this one, 'cause it's the epitome of where I want to go with the future.|$|E

500|$|Lew Grade, the ITC Entertainment financier, ordered Anderson {{to cancel}} {{production}} on The Secret Service during a test {{screening of the}} pilot episode, [...] "A Case for the Bishop", in December 1968. Objecting to the concept {{on the grounds that}} audiences in the United States would be confused by the Unwinese, Grade capped the production at the thirteen episodes that either had been completed or were in production {{at the time of the}} screening. Anderson countered that a nonsense language such as Unwinese is inherently incomprehensible, and questioned Grade's reasoning for the cancellation, responding that [...] "I chose Stanley Unwin because you are not supposed to understand Stanley Unwin, even if you're British. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> the Americans don't understand him either, what's the difference?" ...|$|E
500|$|Originally it wasn't {{going to}} have {{anything}} to do with that, but people were looking through my photo albums this year. My father and I had made some photo albums together of his relatives and different people in the family. A couple people saw [...] and they were like, 'This is amazing that you have this.' I guess everybody was like, 'How would you feel about this type of concept ?' So I guess <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> someone's going to do it might as well be me. The story line [...] is about an interracial couple. It's sort of Romeo and Juliet but it's set in the '60s and they're kind of torn apart. It's about their struggle and I'm sort of the narrator. I don't want to give too much away about it, but it's nice. Something I could relate to, being the product of an interracial union, though [...] did not wind up happily ever after standing in church together.|$|E

500|$|During the {{production}} of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 1991 album Blood Sugar Sex Magik, producer Rick Rubin regularly visited singer Anthony Kiedis to review Kiedis' new material. He found a poem titled [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] while flipping through Kiedis' notebook and instantly took an interest in the poignant lyrics. Rubin suggested that Kiedis show it {{to the rest of the}} band: [...] "I thought it was beautiful. I said 'We've got to do this.'" [...] Kiedis was reluctant, as he felt the poem was too emotional and did not fit the Chili Peppers' style. After singing the poem to guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith, Kiedis recalls that they [...] "got up and walked over to their instruments and started finding the beat and guitar chords to match it". Frusciante chose the chords he played in the introduction to balance out the depressing nature of the lyrics, saying [...] "my brain interpreted it as being a really sad song so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> the lyrics are really sad like that I should write some chords that are happier".|$|E
500|$|On August 2, 2009, Beyoncé had a revue titled I Am... Yours at the Encore Theater, in Wynn Las Vegas {{during a}} stint on her {{worldwide}} I Am... Tour (2009–2010). Her performance {{was backed by}} her all-female band, Suga Mama, and an orchestra. The show was choreographed by Beyoncé and Frank Gatson Jr. Regarding her I Am... Yours revue, Beyoncé said, [...] "I've always wanted to perform in Las Vegas, I've {{always wanted to do}} my own show there, {{because a lot of the}} icons that I look up to had amazing shows in Las Vegas. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> I'm going to have my own Las Vegas show, it has to be right and it has to have heart and soul and it has to be something memorable...

500|$|When Kirk and Spock are {{traveling}} {{on a public}} bus, they encounter a punk rocker blaring his music on a boom box, to the discomfort of everyone around him. Spock takes matters {{into his own hands}} and performs a Vulcan nerve pinch. Part of the inspiration for the scene came from Nimoy's personal experiences with a similar character on the streets of New York; [...] " [...] by the arrogance of it, the aggressiveness of it, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> I was Spock I'd pinch his brains out!" [...] On learning about the scene, Kirk Thatcher, an associate producer on the film, convinced Nimoy to let him play the role; Thatcher shaved his hair into a mohawk and bought clothes to complete the part. Credited as [...] "punk on bus", Thatcher (along with sound designer Mark Mangini) also wrote and recorded [...] "I Hate You", the song in the scene, and it was his idea to have the punk—rendered unconscious by the pinch—hit the stereo and turn it off with his face.|$|E

500|$|Despite its {{derivative}} nature, Longacre's eagle {{has been}} widely admired. According to art historian Cornelius Vermeule in his book on U.S. coins, the flying eagle motif, when used in the 1830s, was [...] "the first numismatic bird that {{could be said to}} derive from nature rather than from colonial carving or heraldry". Vermeule described the Flying Eagle cent's replacement, the Indian Head cent, as [...] "far less attractive to the eye than the Peale-Gobrecht flying eagle and its variants". Sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, when commissioned in 1905 to provide new designs for American coinage, sought to return a flying eagle design to the cent, writing to President Theodore Roosevelt, [...] "I am using a flying eagle, a modification of the device which was used on the cent of 1857. I had not seen that coin for many years, and was so impressed by it that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> carried out with some modifications, nothing better could be done. It is by all odds the best design on any American coin." [...] Saint-Gaudens did return the flying eagle to American coinage, but his design was used for the reverse of the double eagle rather than the cent.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 52, {{he began}} to revive his career and started taking acting classes, {{something}} he had not thought about after being cast in Neighbours. He described his age, unknown status and willingness {{to work for a}} relatively low fee as being his main assets for getting work in America. His drama teacher, who he has remained with ever since, told him [...] "that you might want to play great roles, but truth is you will get cast as a specific type. Just work out your type. The others in the class said I was a bit Anthony Hopkins and a bit Sean Connery and that went into my head. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> I go for roles those guys would go for I'm more likely to get them." [...] The first role he was offered was a part in a series called Sign of Life, a show about a rock band, which eventually fell through. Dale only received a couple of auditions during his first year in America, but his break came when he was cast as the South African Al Patterson in four episodes of ER. Since then, Dale has been [...] "busier than ever". He has appeared in many television series including guest appearances on The West Wing, Torchwood, The Lone Gunmen, Californication, and The Practice. Many of these have been recurring roles, such as the part of Tom Morrow in JAG and its spin-off NCIS, as well as appearing in three episodes, including the series finale, of The X-Files, playing the [...] "Toothpick Man". He played the recurring role of Vice President of the United States Jim Prescott for seven episodes of the second season of 24, a part which was originally supposed to be a single scene. Dale had recurring roles in the serial Midnight Man and the Australian series Sea Patrol in 2008. He also had recurring parts on Undercovers, Entourage as John Ellis, the fictional owner of Warner Bros., and the British series Moving Wallpaper as a fictional version of himself. He had a recurring role as King George in the series Once Upon a Time, and Emmett in Hot in Cleveland, before joining the main cast of Dominion in 2014, playing General Edward Riesen.|$|E
500|$|Kiedis focused lyrically {{on sexual}} {{references}} and innuendos {{as they were}} frequently on his mind. Songs such as [...] "Suck My Kiss", [...] "If You Have to Ask", [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy", [...] "Give It Away" [...] and [...] "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" [...] all contained various sexual links, with lyrics like [...] "A state of sexual light / Kissing her virginity / My affinity" [...] and [...] "Glorious euphoria / Is my must / Erotic shock / Is a function of lust." [...] The concept behind [...] "The Greeting Song" [...] was a request by Rubin, who asked Kiedis to write a song solely about girls and cars. Although Kiedis disliked the concept, he wrote the song as Rubin requested and ended up hating nearly {{every aspect of the}} lyrics. Kiedis also began to write about anguish, and the self mutilating thoughts he would experience {{as a result of his}} heroin and cocaine addiction; he believed his life had come to its lowest point under a bridge in downtown Los Angeles. Over a month later, Rubin stumbled upon a poem that would become the lyrics to [...] "Under the Bridge", and suggested Kiedis show it to the rest of the band. Kiedis was, however, apprehensive because he believed the lyrics to be [...] "too soft" [...] and unlike the band's style. After singing the verse to Frusciante, they began structuring the song the next day. The two worked for several hours arranging chords and melodies until they both agreed it was complete. Frusciante ultimately chose the chords he played in the intro to balance out the depressing atmosphere of the song: [...] "my brain interpreted it as being a really sad song so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> the lyrics are really sad like that I should write some chords that are happier." [...] "Naked in the Rain" [...] was one of the first songs written for the album and even played once at the end of the Mother's Milk Tour in 1990 while the intros for [...] "The Greeting Song" [...] and [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy" [...] were also teased during the end of that tour but neither song was completed or had lyrics.|$|E

2500|$|The Band also {{inspired}} Grace Potter, of Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, to {{form the}} band in 2002. In {{an interview with the}} Montreal Gazette, Potter said, [...] "The Band blew my mind. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> this is what Matt [...] meant when he said 'Let's start a rock 'n' roll band,' ... that was the kind of rock 'n' roll band I could believe in." ...|$|E
2500|$|McCartney's initial {{concern was}} that he had subconsciously plagiarised someone else's work (known as cryptomnesia). As he put it, [...] "For about a month I went round to people in the music {{business}} and asked them whether they had ever heard it before. Eventually it became like handing something in to the police. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> no one claimed it after a few weeks then I could have it." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 10 December, however, {{he wrote}} in his diary that Yaw was [...] "improving rapidly" [...] and [...] "sang the song really superbly: brilliant.

She was replaced in the role by Isabel Jay.|$|E
2500|$|A McCain {{campaign}} ad {{crafted by}} Fred Davis compared Barack Obama to known celebrities such as Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, and questioned his readiness to lead while criticizing his energy policy. The ads {{resulted in a}} tightening of Obama's lead in polls. After the election, Obama deputy campaign manager Steve Hildebrand said: [...] "It {{was the first time}} during the general election where I started to freak out... <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> they can brand him as a celebrity rather than as a serious leader we're going to be in serious trouble." ...|$|E
