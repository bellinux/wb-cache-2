5|$|The longer {{distance}} tracks carry Regionalbahn and Regional-Express routes RE1 (Magdeburg to Eisenhüttenstadt), RE2 (Rathenow to Cottbus), RE7 (Dessau to Wünsdorf-Waldstadt) and RB14 (Nauen to Berlin Schönefeld Airport). Although most InterCity and Intercity-Express trains now use {{the north-south}} tunnel route via Hauptbahnhof, some trains do still {{remain on the}} Stadtbahn's long distance tracks. These trains, mainly those <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> Hanover and Cologne, usually call at Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof.|$|E

5|$|Provisions {{were now}} running low, {{and with the}} rescue mission overdue, Maxwell began formulating a plan to capture {{sufficient}} proas {{to escape from the}} island. While the plan was being proposed a sail was spotted on the horizon, <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> the island. The appearance of this vessel, coupled with a sudden attack spearheaded by Alceste's marines, caused the pirates to flee. The rescue ship was Ternate, a 16-gun brig belonging to the British East India Company's navy, the Bombay Marine, despatched by Lord Amherst on the day of his arrival in Batavia.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the summer}} of 2006, the Stadtbahn was the main {{thoroughfare}} for long-distance trains, which usually stopped at Zoologischer Garten and Ostbahnhof (which was renamed in 1998). When the new Hauptbahnhof opened on 28 May 2006 {{the importance of the}} line diminished slightly, as many trains now would use the new north-south line connected to the Hauptbahnhof. The remaining intercity trains on the Stadtbahn, mainly those <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> Hanover and Cologne, now usually call at Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof.|$|E
5|$|It {{originated}} {{in an area}} of low pressure that developed over the western Gulf of Mexico on December10, downstream from an upper-level cyclone. The surface low tracked northward to Oklahoma before turning eastward as it gradually intensified. Simultaneously, a shortwave trough swung southeastward around the periphery of a large vortex over central and eastern Canada. As the upper low opened up into a negatively tilted trough and began to interact with the northern wave, a secondary surface cyclone developed along a frontal boundary over South Carolina late on December11. Almost immediately thereafter, the original low dissipated over West Virginia. <b>Heading</b> <b>toward</b> the northeast, the incipient storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, at 00:00UTC on December12.|$|E

5|$|On 12 November 1864, {{before the}} siege of Paysandú, the Paraguayan {{dictator}} Solano López seized the Brazilian steamer Marquês de Olinda, beginning the Paraguayan War. While the Army of the South crossed Uruguay <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> Paysandú, Brazil's government sent José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco) to replace Saraiva. He arrived in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires on 2 December {{and a few days}} later sought a formal alliance with Mitre against the Blancos. The Argentine president refused, insisting that neither he nor his government had any role in Flores' rebellion, and that Argentina would remain neutral. On 26 December, the Paraguayans invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso, laying waste to towns and the countryside.|$|E
5|$|Fearing Castro was a socialist, the U.S. {{instructed}} Cantillo to oust Batista. Cantillo secretly {{agreed to}} a ceasefire with Castro, promising that Batista would be tried as a war criminal; however, Batista was warned, and fled into exile with over US$300,000,000 on December 31, 1958. Cantillo entered Havana's Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos Piedra to be President, and began appointing the new government. Furious, Castro ended the ceasefire, and ordered Cantillo's arrest by sympathetic figures in the army. Accompanying celebrations at news of Batista's downfall on January 1, 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to prevent widespread looting and vandalism. Cienfuegos and Guevara led their columns into Havana on January 2, while Castro entered Santiago and gave a speech invoking the wars of independence. <b>Heading</b> <b>toward</b> Havana, he greeted cheering crowds at every town, giving press conferences and interviews.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Julia was the easternmost Category4 {{hurricane}} {{recorded in}} the Atlantic basin since reliable satellite observations became available. The twelfth tropical cyclone, fifth hurricane and fourth major hurricane of the 2010Atlantic hurricane season, Julia rapidly developed on September12 from a tropical wave near Cape Verde. Passing near the islands, the system quickly organized into Tropical Storm Julia the next day. On September14, Julia attained hurricane status and subsequently entered a trend of rapid intensification; the storm strengthened from a minimal hurricane to a low-end Category4 in only 24hours. After peaking in intensity, further development was impeded as interaction with nearby Hurricane Igor began to occur; the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm by September18. It subsequently moved into a region of unfavorable conditions, <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> lower sea surface temperatures. Correspondingly, Julia entered an extratropical transition on September20, and advisories on the storm were discontinued by that time.|$|E

5|$|MD 404 enters Caroline County upon {{crossing}} the Tuckahoe Creek, where it becomes Shore Highway. It widens into a four-lane divided highway and {{emerges from the}} woods into agricultural areas, intersecting MD 480 (Ridgely Road) near Hillsboro. Past that intersection, the route heads through a mix of woods and residences, narrowing back into a two-lane undivided road, before intersecting MD 404 Alt. (Hillsboro Road), where MD 404 heads into a mix of farms and woodland. Unsigned MD 485 (Saathoff Road) loops {{to the south of}} MD 404, returning to the route before the intersection with the southern terminus of MD 312 (Downes Station Road). The route continues to the southeast through farms, <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> Denton. As the road approaches Denton, it widens into a four-lane divided highway that heads through rural areas with some residences and businesses. MD 404 Bus. (Meeting House Road) splits from MD 404 to head through the center of Denton while MD 404 continues east to bypass Denton to the north.|$|E
5|$|On June 28, Washington {{learned that}} the British fleet had set sail from Halifax on June 9 and were <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> New York. On June 29, signals were sent from men {{stationed}} on Staten Island, indicating that the British fleet had appeared. Within a few hours, 45 British ships dropped anchor in Lower New York Bay. Less than a week later, there were 130 ships off Staten Island {{under the command of}} Richard Howe, the brother of the general. The population of New York went into panic {{at the sight of the}} British ships; alarms went off and troops immediately rushed to their posts. On July 2, British troops began to land on Staten Island. The continental regulars on the island took a few shots at them before fleeing, and the citizens' militia switched over to the British side.|$|E
5|$|Teaneck {{is split}} {{east and west}} by {{railroad}} tracks, which currently provide freight service by CSX Transportation. Until 1959, passenger train service was provided on these same tracks by the West Shore Railroad, with Teaneck stations at Cedar Lane and West Englewood Avenue. Commuter service was available from these stations, with 44 passenger trains operating daily to and from Weehawken, where Hudson River ferry service was available to New York City at 42nd Street and at the Financial District in Lower Manhattan. Train service from Teaneck was also available north to Albany, along the west shore of the river. Efforts are ongoing to restore some passenger train service on this line for commuters <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> New York City, including extension of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail service via the Northern Branch to Englewood or Tenafly.|$|E

5|$|The first Ju 88s {{took off}} at 23:00 and began <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> the Dutch coast where they dived to sea level and stayed at {{approximately}} 50 metres while they flew out to sea. Crews {{were forbidden to}} engage enemy aircraft over the North Sea {{in order to preserve}} surprise until the last possible moment. The rain and squall assisted crews in judging the location and distance of the water. However, with crews prone to human error, it was decided to use the very accurate FuG 101 radar altimeter and the Ju 88s blind-flying instruments. The strain on the crews was enormous, as a careful vigil was kept on them until the British coast was reached and the pilot began his ascent to the height of the returning bomber stream. As they did so, the Ju 88s released Düppel to obscure the radar of Mosquito fighters. The pilots were then free to begin their attacks.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of galaxies in the Universe are moving away from the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, is <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> it at about 120km/s. In 4billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, causing both to deform as tidal forces distort their outer arms into vast tidal tails. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% chance that the Solar System will be pulled outward into the Milky Way's tidal tail and a 3% chance that it will become gravitationally bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy. After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%, the galaxies' supermassive black holes will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant elliptical galaxy. During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming elliptical galaxy. This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a starburst. In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an active galactic nucleus. The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of the Baltimore Beltway to be {{completed}} was in December 1955 between MD 25 (Falls Road) and the Harrisburg Expressway (present-day I-83). In 1956, the next portion of the road between the Harrisburg Expressway and MD 45 (York Road) opened. Several more segments of the Baltimore Beltway would be built in the following years, with the section from MD 168 (Nursery Road) to the Glen Burnie Bypass (present-day I-97) opening in 1957; the portions from MD 45 to MD 542 (Loch Raven Boulevard), MD 7 (Old Philadelphia Road) to US 40 (Pulaski Highway), and from MD 168 to US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) opening in 1958; the segment from MD 2 (Ritchie Highway) to the Glen Burnie Bypass completed in 1960; the portion from US 1 (Belair Road) to MD 7 finished in 1961; and the portions from MD 542 to US 1 and from US 40 to MD 25 finished in 1962. At this time, the original length of the Baltimore Beltway, from MD 2 in the south clockwise to US 40 in the northeast, was fully completed and opened to traffic, providing the first Interstate-grade bypass of Baltimore and the first beltway in the United States built under the Interstate Highway System. A segment of the road completed in 1973 ran from MD 10 to MD 2, <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> the Outer Harbor Crossing.|$|E

5|$|US219 enters Maryland in the {{southwest}} corner of Garrett County just to the west of Backbone Mountain. The U.S. Highway heads northeast from the West Virginia state line as two-lane Garrett Highway. After crossing the Youghiogheny River, US 219 meets US50 (George Washington Highway) at an intersection with a two-way stop in the hamlet of Red House. The highway turns northwest to intersect Ben Dewitt Road, a shortcut between US219 and US50 at the state line to the west, then resumes its northeasterly course <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> Gortner, where the highway crosses Cherry Creek and Ambrose Run. US219 veers north and crosses the Little Youghiogheny River and CSX's Mountain Subdivision before entering the town of Oakland and meeting the west end of MD135 (Maryland Highway). The U.S. Highway turns west onto Oak Street while Ninth Street (unsigned MD 219) continues north. US219 heads west through the Oakland Historic District.
