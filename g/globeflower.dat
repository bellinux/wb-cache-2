40|$|International audienceThe {{distribution}} of genetic variation and the phylogenetic relationships between 18 {{populations of the}} arctic-alpine plant Trollius europaeus were analysed in three main regions (Alps, Pyrenees and Fennoscandia) by using dominant AFLP markers. Analysis of molecular variance revealed {{that most of the}} genetic variability was found within populations (64 %), although variation among regions (17 %) and among populations within regions (19 %) was highly significant (P < 0. 001). Accordingly, the global fixation index F-ST averaged over loci was high (0. 39). The among-population differentiation indicates restricted gene flow, congruent with limited dispersal of specific <b>globeflower's</b> pollinating flies (Chiastocheta spp.). Within-population diversity levels were significantly higher in the Alps (mean Nei's expected heterozygosity H-E = 0. 229) than in the Pyrenees (H-E = 0. 197) or in Fennoscandia (H-E = 0. 158). This finding is congruent with the species-richness of the associated flies, which is maximum in the Alps. We discuss the processes involved in shaping observed patterns of genetic diversity within and among T. europaeus populations. Genetic drift is the major factor acting on the small Pyrenean populations at the southern edge of T. europaeus distribution, while large Fennoscandian populations result probably from a founder effect followed by demographic expansion. The Alpine populations represent moderately fragmented relics of large southern ancestral populations. The patterns of genetic variability observed in the host plant support the hypothesis of sympatric speciation in associated flies, rather than recurrent allopatric speciations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Mutualisms are {{inherently}} conflictual as one partner always benefits from reducing the costs {{imposed by the}} other. Despite the widespread recognition that mutualisms are essentially reciprocal exploitation, there are few documented examples of traits that limit the costs of mutualism. In plant/seed-eating pollinator interactions the only mechanisms reported so far are those specific to one particular system, such as the selective abortion of over-exploited fruits. Results This study shows that plant chemical defence against developing larvae constitutes another partner sanction mechanism in nursery mutualisms. It documents the chemical defence used by <b>globeflower</b> Trollius europaeus L. (Ranunculaceae) against the seed-eating larvae of six pollinating species of the genus Chiastocheta Pokorny (Anthomyiidae). The correlative field study carried out shows that the severity of damage caused by Chiastocheta larvae to <b>globeflower</b> fruits {{is linked to the}} accumulation in the carpel walls of a C-glycosyl-flavone (adonivernith), which reduces the larval seed predation ability per damaged carpel. The different Chiastocheta species do not exploit the fruit in the same way and their interaction with the plant chemical defence is variable, both in terms of induction intensity and larval sensitivity to adonivernith. Conclusion Adonivernith accumulation and larval predation intensity appear to be both the reciprocal cause and effect. Adonivernith not only constitutes an effective chemical means of partner control, but may also {{play a key role in}} the sympatric diversification of the Chiastocheta genus. </p...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 1. We propose {{an alternative}} {{model to the}} host-shifting model of sympatric speciation in plant-insect systems. The role of competition in driving ecological adaptive radiation was evaluated in a seed predator exploiting a single host-plant species. Sympatric speciation may occur through disruptive selection on oviposition timing if this shift decreases competition among larvae feeding on seeds. 2. The <b>globeflower</b> fly Chiastocheta presents a unique case of adaptive radiation, with at least six sister species co-developing in fruits of Trollius europaeus. These species all feed on seeds, and differ in their oviposition timing, one species ovipositing in 1 -day-old flowers (early species), while all the other species sequentially oviposit throughout the flower life span (late species). We evaluated the impact of conspecific and heterospecific larvae on larval installation success, and on larval fresh mass and area, for early and late species, in natural conditions. 3. None of the three larval traits measured was correlated with fruit size, and no fruit lost all seeds to predation, suggesting that seed availability was not a limiting factor for larval development. 4. Our results show strong intraspecific competition among early larvae for larval installation, and among late larvae for larval mass. By contrast, larval competition between species was weak. These {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that shifts in oviposition promoted rapid radiation in <b>globeflower</b> flies by lowering competition among larvae...|$|E
40|$|Times Cited: 16 Reference Count: 35 International audienceMutualisms are {{characterized}} by balanced reciprocal exploitation. This creates an evolutionary conflict in that selection will favour individuals that increase their fitness {{at the cost of}} the mutualist partner. To counter this evolutionary instability, each partner must be able to prevent over-exploitation by the other. In plant/seed-parasite pollinator mutualisms like that involving the <b>globeflower</b> Trollius europaeus and the <b>globeflower</b> fly (Chiastocheta spp.), ovipositing females can have a more or less mutualistic/antagonistic effect on plant seed output, depending on the amount of pollination achieved during oviposition, the number of eggs laid and seed predation per larva. We found that flowers with no Chiastocheta egg had a high seed set and there was no significant increase in seed set before predation with increasing egg load, suggesting that most pollination is achieved by non-ovipositing visitors (males and/or non-ovipositing females). Hence, additional eggs do not lead to higher pollination, oviposition is a non-mutualistic behaviour and, therefore, there is a conflict between T. europaeus and Chiastocheta flies for the number of eggs laid. Egg load increases throughout flower lifespan. No mechanism seems to have evolved to regulate the number of eggs laid on T. europaeus. For example, controlled pollination experiments showed that T europaeus cannot limit Chiastocheta oviposition by triggering flower senescence as soon as full pollination has been achieved. In this context, the high average number of eggs per flower observed in alpine populations is not surprising. Finally, the decrease in net seed production with increasing egg load was weak. We discuss the other factors involved in the regulation of the conflict between T europaeus and Chiastocheta flies...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePlant/seed-eater pollinators mutualisms {{involve a}} plant pollinated by an insect whose larvae develop by eating a {{fraction}} of host-plant seeds. The outcome of the interaction therefore depends {{on the number of}} ovules fertilized by adult visits and the number of seeds destroyed by larvae. Among the very few cases of such mutualisms reported so far is the globeflower-globeflower flies mutualism, which is unique in that it involves several congeneric fly species (Chiastocheta genus) coexisting within a single host-plant species, Trollius europaeus. These species exhibit contrasted oviposition behaviors resulting in a more or less beneficial outcome for the plant. We designed an adaptive dynamics model to investigate how morphological traits of <b>globeflower</b> could affect the evolution of oviposition in its pollinating flies. Three fly traits (flower age at oviposition, clutch size and the level of avoidance of already parasitized flowers) and one plant trait (closed or open corolla) were examined. Whatever the shape of the flower, evolutionary branching occurs between early and late ovipositing flies, driven by strong competition among larvae within a fruit. Once this branching occurred, the closed shape of the corolla is likely to offer a better protection to eggs of early but not of late ovipositing flies. The difference in egg survival results in higher competition among early larvae and thus selects for decreased clutch size in early flies. This {{can be seen as a}} first step in the evolution of a mutualistic behavior. The prediction of our model fits field observations of fly behavior, giving theoretical support to the hypothesis of fly sympatric speciation within its host plant. Moreover, flower closed globe shape can be positively selected in globeflowers as it results in a reduction of parasitism strength. This last evolution therefore leads to a stable mutualism between globeflowers and <b>globeflower</b> flies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePlant-seed {{parasite}} pollination mutualisms {{involve a}} specific pollinator whose larvae develop by consuming {{a fraction of}} the host plant seeds. These mutualisms are stable only if the plant can control seed destruction by the larvae. Here, we studied the chemical response of the European <b>globeflower</b> Trollius europaeus to infestation by an increasing number of Chiastocheta fly larvae. We used liquid chromatographic analysis to compare the content of phenolic compounds in unparasitized and parasitized fruits collected in two natural populations of the French Alps, and mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance to elucidate the structure of adonivernith, a C-glycosyl-flavone. This compound is present in many of the organs of T. europaeus, but not found in other Trollius species. Furthermore, it is overproduced in the carpel walls of parasitized fruits, and this induced response to infestation by fly larvae is density-dependent (increases with larval number), and site-dependent (more pronounced in the high-altitude site). Mechanical damage did not induce adonivernith production. This tissue-specific and density-dependent response of T. europaeus to infestation by Chiastocheta larvae might be an efficient regulation mechanism of seed-predator mutualist population growth if it decreases survival or growth of the larvae...|$|E
40|$|Whether or not species {{participating}} in specialized and obligate interactions display similar and simultaneous demographic variations at the intraspecific level {{remains an open}} question in phylogeography. In the present study, we used the mutualistic nursery pollination occurring between the European <b>globeflower</b> Trollius europaeus and its specialized pollinators in the genus Chiastocheta as a case study. Explicitly, we investigated if the phylogeographies of the pollinating flies are significantly different from the expectation under a scenario of plant-insect congruence.

40|$|Phylogenetic {{inference}} {{can potentially}} {{result in a}} more accurate tree using data from multiple loci. However, if the loci are incongruent [...] due to events such as incomplete lineage sorting or horizontal gene transfer [...] it can be misleading to infer a single tree. To address this, many previous contributions have taken a mechanistic approach, by modelling specific processes. Alternatively, one can cluster loci without assuming how these incongruencies might arise. Such "process-agnostic" approaches typically infer a tree for each locus and cluster these. There are, however, many possible combinations of tree distance and clustering methods; their comparative performance {{in the context of}} tree incongruence is largely unknown. Furthermore, because standard model selection criteria such as AIC cannot be applied to problems with a variable number of topologies, the issue of inferring the optimal number of clusters is poorly understood. Here, we perform a large-scale simulation study of phylogenetic distances and clustering methods to infer loci of common evolutionary history. We observe that the best-performing combinations are distances accounting for branch lengths followed by spectral clustering or Ward's method. We also introduce two statistical tests to infer the optimal number of clusters and show that they strongly outperform the silhouette criterion, a general-purpose heuristic.

40|$|International audienceSome {{plants are}} {{exclusively}} pollinated by an insect whose larvae feed on their seeds. The net {{outcome of a}} single visit for the plant depends {{on the number of}} ovules fertilised by the visitor, the number of eggs laid, and the number of seeds eaten by each larva. Unlike other known plant-seed eater pollinating mutualisms, the globeflower-globeflower fly mutualism (Trollius europaeus-Chiastocheta spp.) is unique in that not only females but also males visit flowers, and both sexes are potential pollinators. I analysed the relative efficiency of Chiastocheta males versus females in transporting pollen and fertilising <b>globeflower</b> ovules. I show that there is no sex-specific morphological adaptation or behaviour to enhance pollen collection and transportation in Chiastocheta flies, and that males contribute to pollination. However, because of their smaller body size, males transport significantly less pollen than females. Less seeds are produced after a visit from a male than after a visit from a female. A single female visit contributes to about 12 % of total seed production, and a single male visit to only 5. 4 %. Females tend to spend more time inside the flower than males, and the number of ovules fertilised is significantly correlated with the time insects spent inside the closed corolla. The lower efficiency of ovule fertilisation by a male's single visit is compensated for by the higher rate of flower visitation by males: a flower receives about twice as many visits from males as from females during a time unit. The contribution of males to pollination is of major importance with respect to understanding the evolutionary stability of the globeflower-globeflower fly mutualism, as males satiate pollen requirement of flowers, masking the antagonistic effect of ovipositing females...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInterspecific {{interactions}} {{can vary}} within and among populations and geographic locations, and this variation {{can influence the}} nature of the interaction (e. g. mutualistic vs. antagonistic) and its evolutionary stability. Globeflowers are exclusively pollinated by flies, whose larvae feed only on their seeds. Here we document geographic variability in costs and benefits in globeflowers in sustaining their pollinating flies throughout the range of this arctic-alpine European plant over several years. A total of 1, 710 flower heads from 38 populations were analysed for their carpel, egg and seed contents. Individual and population analyses control for the confounding influences of variation in both: (1) population traits, such as fly density and egg distribution among flower heads; and (2) individuals traits, such as carpel and egg numbers per flower head. Despite considerable variation in ecological conditions and pollinator densities across populations, large proportions (range 33 - 58 %) of seeds were released after predation, with a benefit-to-cost ratio of 3, indicating that the mutualism is stable over the whole <b>globeflower</b> geographical range. The stability of the mutualistic interaction relies on density-dependent competition among larvae co-developing in a flower head. This competition is revealed by a sharp {{decrease in the number of}} seeds eaten per larva with increasing larval number, and is intensified by non-uniform egg distribution among globeflowers within a population. Carpel number is highly variable across globeflowers (range 10 - 69), and flies lay more eggs in large flowers. Most plants within a population contribute to the rearing of pollinators, but the costs are greater for some than for others. Large globeflowers lose more seed to pollinator larvae, but also release more seed than smaller plants. The apparent alignment of interests between fly and plants (positive relationship between numbers of seed released and destroyed) is shown to hide a conflict of interest found when flower size is controlled for...|$|E
