40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to evaluate the performance of microphysical parameterizations in cloud resolving model (CRM). The goal is to understand the reasons for differences between simulated cloud statistics and observations. I focus on simulations of two convective case studies. The first case is the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program 1997 summer Intensive Observation Periods (IOP) over its Southern Great Plains (SGP) site (ARM 9707 hereafter). The second case is the Kwajalein Experiment (KWAJEX) around the Kwajalein island in the tropical Pacific region. Simulated cloud occurrence and histograms by reflectivity and height are compared with radar and satellite observations obtained during these two cases. For ARM 9707, double moment microphysics generates much more <b>high–level</b> <b>cloud</b> than observations and the simulated OLR is underestimated by both single and double moment microphysics. When running the CRM in a “forecast” mode, cloud occurrence and OLR come to a better agreement with observations, especially during relatively dry periods after precipitation events. Sensitivity tests with double moment microphysics show small changes to cloud occurrence compared to model ensemble spread and the bias with respect to observations. Experiments with water vapor nudging and the “forecast” runs demonstrate the periodic lateral boundary condition is the primary reason for the cloud occurrence overestimation in the month–long simulations. For KWAJEX, neither nudging on thermodynamics nor the “forecast” runs can show the impact of the periodic lateral boundary condition due to a much moister environment than at the ARM SGP site. I find that double moment microphyscis slightly underestimates <b>high–level</b> <b>cloud</b> cover and single moment microphysics generates {{less than half of the}} <b>high–level</b> <b>cloud</b> cover as is shown by ISCCP D 1 cloud amount observations. These underestimations in <b>high–level</b> <b>cloud</b> cover may be related to the large scale forcing errors, especially in the upper troposphere...|$|E

40|$|A new, more {{accurate}} formula for calculating the net longwave radiation flux LW ↑↓ has been devised for the Baltic Sea region.

40|$|High-level clouds have a {{significant}} impact on the radiation energy budgets and, hence, the climate of the Earth. Convective cloud systems, which are controlled by large-scale thermal and dynamical conditions, propagate rapidly within days. At this time scale, changes of sea surface temperature (SST) are small. Radiances measured by Japan's Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) are used to study the relation between high-level clouds and SST in the tropical western and central Pacific (30 S- 30 N; 130 E- 170 W), where the ocean is warm and deep convection is intensive. Twenty months (January 1998 - August, 1999) of GMS data are used, which cover the second half of the strong 1997 - 1998 El Nino. Brightness temperature at the 11 -micron channel is used to identify high-level clouds. The core of convection is identified based on the difference in the brightness temperatures of the 11 - and 12 -micron channels. Because of the rapid movement of clouds, there is little correlation between clouds six hours apart. When most of deep convection moves to regions of high SST, the domain averaged <b>high-level</b> <b>cloud</b> amount decreases. A + 2 C change of SST in cloudy regions results in a relative change of - 30 % in <b>high-level</b> <b>cloud</b> amount. This large change in cloud amount is due to clouds moving from cool regions to warm regions but not the change in SST itself. A reduction in <b>high-level</b> <b>cloud</b> amount in the equatorial region implies an expanded dry upper troposphere in the off-equatorial region, and the greenhouse warming of high clouds and water vapor is reduced through enhanced longwave cooling to space.

The current {{understanding of}} the temporal and spatial distribution of clouds over southern and central Africa is poor and the regional processes governing cloud occurrence is only weakly understood. This study seeks to improve the current understanding of cloud diurnal variability over this region by providing a base-line diurnal climatology of lowlevel, mid-level and <b>high-level</b> <b>cloud</b> cover. Diurnal variations of cloudiness are examined using ten years of cloud data from latest version of the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP-D 1). The broad seasonal average diurnal variability is explored across the region. Thereafter a more detailed analysis of regionally specific variability is made using a Self-Organising Map. The {{findings of this study}} are in broad agreement with previous work. Cloud over the southern and central African region shows clear spatial organisation, most significantly associated with the location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The diurnal variation of <b>high-level</b> <b>cloud</b> is large, closely correlated to its mean and is enhanced by orographic features. Minimum <b>high-level</b> <b>cloud</b> occurs at 1100 LST and maximum extent is reached during the evening around 1800 LST, except in locations experiencing deep convection which displayed a redevelopment of cloud in the early morning (0300 LST). This redevelopment of HLCA is hypothesised to be due to the destabilization of the upper troposphere through nighttime cloud radiative cooling. Mid-level cloud exhibits smaller diurnal variations, reaching maximum coverage at approximately 0300 LST. Clouds at this level are severely obscured by higher clouds and therefore the detected diurnal variation is due to both real and artificial signals and care needs to be taken in interpreting the results. Low-level cloud shows strong diurnal variations when not obscured by higher clouds, reaching a maximum just after midday. The results of this study are interpreted in terms of the life-cycle of deep convective cloudiness. A number of mechanisms are suggested to explain the regional differences in diurnal variations with land surface heating being the primary mechanism...|$|E

Recent analysis found that a net decrease in tropical high-cloud fraction is due to a compensation of a decrease in cirrostratus and deep convective clouds and an increase in cirrus cloud, and that the relationship between near-global mean high-cloud fraction and SST are insignificant (Liu et al. 2017). These similarities and differences among observations, NICAM, and GCMs should be further investigated to offer clues to reducing uncertainty in climate sensitivity.|$|E

Similar correlations are also present between winter cyclone intensity, the related storm track latitude shifts, and cosmic ray flux changes on the decadal time scale. These point to a mechanism in which atmospheric electrical processes affect tropospheric thermodynamics, with a requirement for energy amplification by a factor of about 107 and a time scale of hours.

This algorithm has been adapted by SAFNWC to the spectral characteristics and field of view of each satellite. Retrieved cloud cover characteristics (cloud mask, classification and top pressure) are evaluated over four months in summer of 2009 against CALIOP lidar observations from the CALIPSO polar-orbiting satellite. To better identify atmospheric and instrumental issues, separate analyses are performed over land and ocean, for 0130 AM and 0130 PM CALIPSO overpasses and for each GEO. Both mean cloud cover occurrence and instantaneous cloud cover statistics are compared. We found that each classification has specific features, which depend on observed cloud regimes and instrument capabilities. Most important, a common behaviour of the GEOs against CALIOP depending on cloud types is observed. We found that GEO cloud occurrence is lower by about 10 % than CALIOP, with the largest biases over land during daytime and the smallest over ocean during daytime. Further detailed analysis reveals specific discrepancies in the retrieved cloud types. As expected, <b>high-level</b> <b>clouds</b> are detected more frequently by the lidar. We show that, over ocean when the optical thickness of detected <b>high-level</b> <b>clouds</b> is limited to greater than 0. 1 in the comparisons, multi-spectral radiometry performs very similarly. However, the most significant difference is attributed to non-detection of low-level clouds that are often broken, which causes a reduction of up to 20 % in low-level cloud fraction and even 30 % in some regions. Other significant differences are seen over land, where mid-level clouds are not detected or are misclassified...|$|R
40|$|High-level primary {{production}} (PP) sustainability in the Antarctic coastal polynyas {{has not been}} adequately addressed. We investigated {{the relationship between the}} Antarctic coastal polynyas phytoplankton biomass (as reflected by Chl-a) and the cloud cover, which dominantly influences the light conditions. Phytoplankton biomass in Antarctic coastal polynyas showed a robust correlation with the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and the cloud fraction. However, a different relationship was observed between the phytoplankton biomass and the PAR. This relationship depended on both the ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the geographical location of the coastal polynyas. High intensity UV radiation is suspected to be an inhibitor of phytoplankton biomass. This indicates that the phytoplankton biomass is effectively limited by light intensity, which can be reduced by clouds, particularly mid- and <b>high-level</b> <b>clouds,</b> but it is not limited by light under high-level UV radiation exposure conditions...|$|R
