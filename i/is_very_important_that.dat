A stirrup {{that is too}} narrow will {{increase}} the chance that the boot will get caught in it (which would be very dangerous should the rider fall), and a too-wide stirrup {{makes it harder for}} a rider to keep it under the foot, and presents some risk that the foot might slip all the way through. It is generally suggested that the stirrup be no more than 1inch larger than the widest part of the sole of the rider's boots.|$|E
25|$|The {{attractiveness}} of a constructed wetlands solution {{lies in its}} relative low cost. They are limited by the metal loads they can deal with (either from high flows or metal concentrations), though current practitioners have succeeded in developing constructed wetlands that treat high volumes (see description of Campbell Mine constructed wetland) and/or highly acidic water (with adequate pre-treatment). Typically, the effluent from constructed wetland receiving near-neutral water will be well-buffered at between 6.5-7.0 and can readily be discharged. Some of metal precipitates retained in sediments are unstable when exposed to oxygen (e.g., copper sulfide or elemental selenium), and it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> the wetland sediments remain largely or permanently submerged.|$|E
25|$|The {{very first}} step which is {{normally}} overlooked {{by the top}} level management is defining the exact problem. Though {{we think that the}} problem identification is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. If the problem is not identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem. Hence, it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> the definition of the problem is the same among all group members. Only then is it possible for the group members to find alternate sources or problem solving in an effective manner.|$|E

Orange juice, prune juice, and milk containing fiber should not be consumed, nor should liquids dyed red, purple, orange, or sometimes brown; however, cola is allowed.

500|$|... d [...] The {{propaganda}} line of Jewish Bolshevism {{was used}} intensively by Nazis in instigating antisemitic feelings among Lithuanians. It built upon the pre-invasion antisemitic propaganda of the anti-Soviet Lithuanian Activist Front which had seized upon {{the fact that}} more Jews than Lithuanians supported the Soviet regime. This had helped to create an entire mythos of Jewish culpability for the sufferings of Lithuania under the Soviet regime (and beyond). A LAF pamphlet read: [...] "For the ideological maturation of the Lithuanian nation it is essential that anticommunist and anti-Jewish action be strengthened [...] It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> this opportunity be used {{to get rid of the}} Jews as well. We must create an atmosphere that is so stifling for the Jews that not a single Jew will think that he will have even the most minimal rights or possibility of life in the new Lithuania. Our goal is to drive out the Jews along with the Red Russians. [...] The hospitality extended to the Jews by Vytautas the Great is hereby revoked for all time because of their repeated betrayals of the Lithuanian nation to its oppressors." [...] An extreme faction of the supporters of Augustinas Voldemaras, a group which also worked within the LAF, actually envisioned a racially exclusive [...] "Aryan" [...] Lithuanian state. With the start of German occupation, one of Kaunas' newspapers – Į Laisvę (Towards Freedom), commenced a spirited antisemitic crusade, reinforcing the identity of the Jew with communism in popular consciousness: [...] "Jewry and Bolshevism are one, parts of an indivisible entity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Philidor's {{position}} (see the diagram) illustrates {{an important}} drawing technique in this endgame. The technique {{is also known}} as the third rank defense and works when the defending king is in front of the pawn and the attacking king and pawn have not reached their sixth rank. Black keeps his rook on his third rank to keep the white king from reaching that rank. If White advances the pawn to its sixth rank (Black's third rank), then the king is deprived of shelter, so Black moves his rook to the eighth (or seventh) rank, and keeps checking the white king from behind. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> the defender keep his rook on his third rank, and move {{to the far side of}} the board only after the attacking pawn has moved to its sixth rank. (An exchange of rooks will result in a drawn position, see king and pawn versus king endgame.) See Philidor position for more details [...]|$|E

2500|$|Single block {{wire drawing}} {{machines}} include means for holding the dies accurately in position and for drawing the wire steadily through the holes. The usual design {{consists of a}} cast-iron bench or table having a bracket standing up to hold the die, and a vertical drum which rotates and by coiling the wire around its surface pulls it through the die, the coil of wire being stored upon another drum or [...] "swift" [...] which lies behind the die and reels off the wire as fast as required. The wire drum or [...] "block" [...] is provided with means for rapidly coupling or uncoupling it to its vertical shaft, so that {{the motion of the}} wire may be stopped or started instantly. The block is also tapered, so that the coil of wire may be easily slipped off upwards when finished. Before the wire can be attached to the block, a sufficient length of it must be pulled through the die; this is effected by a pair of gripping pincers {{on the end of a}} chain which is wound around a revolving drum, so drawing the wire until enough can be coiled two or three times on the block, where the end is secured by a small screw clamp or vice. When the wire is on the block, it is set in motion and the wire is drawn steadily through the die; it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> the block rotates evenly and that it runs true and pulls the wire at a constant velocity, otherwise [...] "snatching" [...] occurs which will weaken or even break the wire. The speeds at which wire is drawn vary greatly, according to the material and the amount of reduction.|$|E
