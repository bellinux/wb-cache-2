His robe was of the finest skins, which had been deprived of their fur, in order to admit of a hieroglyphical representation of various deeds in arms, done in former ages. His bosom was loaded with medals, some in massive silver, {{and one or two}} even in gold, the gifts of various Christian potentates during the long period of his life. He also wore armlets, and cinctures above the ankles, of the latter precious metal. His head, on the whole of which the hair had been permitted to grow, the pursuits of war having so long been abandoned, was encircled by a sort of plated diadem, which, in its turn, bore lesser and more glittering ornaments, that sparkled amid the glossy hues of three drooping ostrich <b>feathers,</b> <b>dyed</b> a deep black, in touching contrast to the color of his snow-white locks.

The amanteca had their own god, Coyotlinahual, who had companions called Tizaua, Mamiocelotl and Mamiltochtli. They also honored the female deities Xiuhtlati and Xilo. [...] Daughters of amanteca generally became embroiderers and feather dyers, with the boys dedicated to the making of feather objects. The amanteca were a privileged class of craftsmen. They did not pay tribute nor were required to perform public service. They had {{a fair amount of}} autonomy in how they ran their businesses. Feather work was so highly prized that even sons of nobility learned something of it during their education. The sophistication of this art can be seen in pieces created before the Conquest, some of which are part of the collection of the Museum of Ethnology in Vienna, such as Montezuma's headdress, the ceremonial coat of arms and the great fan or fly whisk. Other important examples such as shields are in museums in Mexico City.The Florentine Codex gives information about how feather works were created. The amantecas had two ways of creating their works.

50|$|In {{the latter}} 20th century, {{a number of}} artists tried {{to bring back the}} {{technique}} as an art form. Painter and tapestry weaver Carmen Padin began researching the technique after hearing Fernando Gamboa lament its loss. From 1979 to 1981, she exhibited her work in various cities of Mexico which included robes, capes, shields and collages. However, she had to stop by the 1990s because of the difficultly of obtaining feathers. Josefina Ortega Salcedo became attracted to the technique after reading about it in the Artes de México magazine. She studied drawing and painting at the Academy of San Carlos with the goal of applying them to feather work. Her most valuable work in this medium includes several portraits, copied from photographs with precision. Her images are placed on a base of light-colored feathers with the images arranged using crepe paper cut outs and colored feathers. However, she, too, no longer works with this technique. Those who still continue to work with it include Elena Sanchez Garrido, who combines feather work and watercolors, and Tita Bilbaro who makes Aztec and modern style images using feathers, sand, fabric, leather, mirrors an sea shells. In the late 1980s she exhibited her work in Mexico City and several places in northern Mexico.One notable family that continues the technique as a handcraft is the Olay family.

5000|$|The {{crowning}} attire of the taupou or manaia was {{the traditional}} headdress {{known as the}} [...] "tuiga." [...] Coconut midribs ("tuaniu") wrapped with strips of tapa cloth were secured to a faceplate ("lave") made of turtle shell {{in such a way}} that the midribs stood upright when the faceplate was tied to the hair above the forehead; the hair was pulled upward into a tight topknot called the [...] "foga" [...] which was then tightly wrapped with tapa into a stiff cone to which the faceplate was tied. The earliest mention of [...] "tuiga" [...] refers to a headdress that was made with an intricately carved vertical [...] "comb" [...] called a [...] "selu tuiga" [...] (literally, [...] "standing up comb"); this teeth of the [...] "selu" [...] were stuck into the hair at the base of the [...] "foga," [...] to which coconut midribs and long tropicbird ("tava'e") feathers were attached. This seems to be the form of the most ancient [...] "tuiga" [...] before the [...] "selu" [...] comb and [...] "tava'e" [...] feathers were replaced by the mother of pearl shell [...] "lave" [...] and [...] "sega" [...] feathers, that has now been supplanted by mirrors, sequins and <b>dyed</b> chicken <b>feathers.</b> The second component of the tuiga was the [...] "pale fuiono," [...] literally [...] "the headband of nautilus shells," [...] made of rows of pearlized nautilus shells tied to a woven headband. Often two or more [...] "pale fuiono" [...] were tied around the wearer's forehead. The third component was the hair ornament, essentially a large wig fashioned from the hair of female relatives. The hair was washed in salt water and dyed with coral lime and citrus juice to give the hair a reddish-brown color, and the strands were tied together to form the [...] "ie lau'ulu" [...] which was tied to the top of the cone that the [...] "lave" [...] faceplate was tied to. The last piece of the tuiga was the [...] "ie'ula" [...] (literally, [...] "red dress") which consisted of strands of tiny red collared lory feathers. Today, the 'ie'ula is generally made of large colorful chicken <b>feathers</b> that are <b>dyed</b> any variety of hues besides the traditional red and white. Modern tuiga headbands also stray from the original design and the use of real [...] "fuiono" [...] nautilus shells is almost obsolete, even in Samoa, where the headband replicas are now fashioned with non-traditional materials such as sequins, rhinestones, and common shells such as cowries. Furthermore, the traditional multi-piece tuiga is almost never seen, having been almost completely replaced with modern one-piece replicas that resemble tall hats, complete with velcro flaps that wrap around the head and attach in the back. This contemporary version of the ancient tuiga also uses materials that were never used traditionally, such as glass mirrors, faux jewels and pearls, plastic mesh and chicken feathers. The one-piece construction and gawdy decorations of most modern tuiga are a far cry from the stately, natural multi-piece tuiga of old Samoa.|$|R
