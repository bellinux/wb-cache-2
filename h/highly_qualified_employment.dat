(1) The question of first entry by third country nationals to the member states’ territory and labour market, while within the competence of the EC since 2001, (2) has been the hardest of the immigration and asylum powers on which to find agreement in the Council. The Commission made a first proposal in 1999, but that was withdrawn after it failed to find sufficient support. That first attempt by the Commission to achieve a directive on first entry for economic activities was characterised by a uniform approach – applying to all types of economic activity...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{refers to}} the economic migration to the European Union from third countries, specifically to the Proposal for a Council directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals {{for the purposes of}} <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>employment</b> (the system of Blue Cards`). The aim of {{the first part of this}} bachelor thesis is to introduce some of theories dealing in migration with the application of the descriptive method of work and by the secondary analysis of the data compiled in the scholarly literature. A brief history of migratory flows, a basic summary of the contemporary demographic evolution and the situation on the labour market, a security point of view and sociological theories serve as an introduction to the broad issue of the migration phenomenon.

40|$|Level V diplomas, such as {{occupational}} proficiency diplomas (CAP) {{and vocational}} diplomas (BEP), {{are less likely}} to lead to qualified jobs than in the past. The professional career paths of young people entering the labour market in September 1992 and in September 1998 were studied, and focused on the three years following their departure from the education system. Five different situations can be distinguished: unemployment, inactivity, non-qualified employment, qualified employment and <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>employment.</b> Regardless of the year or population, movement between these situations is uncommon. Diploma holders find it easier to trade unemployment for employment and {{are less likely to}} become unemployed. For some, the diploma increases their chances of finding a highly qualified job. The diploma holders sector of activity has little bearing on these trends. In short, apprenticeships offer a better professional start than lycée in terms of qualification and job stability.

40|$|The {{proportion}} of women in <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> scientific <b>employment</b> {{in central and eastern}} Europe and the Baltic States (CEEC- 10) is higher than in western Europe. However, this relatively high representation is counteracted by unequal access to resources. This is illustrated by a new measure, the ‘honeypot indicator’. The focus of the EU ‘Lisbon strategy’ summit on increasing overall numbers of scientists does little to address the key issues of retention and advancement. Although social closure mechanisms may undermine the <b>employment</b> prospects of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> women, the conclusion is that the accession of the CEEC- 10 to the ‘mainstreaming’ of equal opportunities proclaimed by the European Union provides the best hope of improvement for their employment prospects...|$|R

40|$|In 2007 the Commission {{proposed}} a Directive aimed exclusively at third-country nationals moving to Europe {{for the purpose}} of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>employment</b> that would set up a harmonized entry procedure, lay down common residence conditions and facilitate mobility through Europe. The Directive, named Blue Card, was meant to make Europe more attractive for highly qualified migrants by offering a fast-track entry procedure and social benefits in the EU. The Commission, despite the reluctance of Member States, managed to push through the Directive, which was finally approved in 2009. In the first three years since the Blue Card first entered into force in the majority of Member States in 2012, no more than 30, 352 cards have been issued, of which about 26, 200 by a single Member State. Why? Through a detailed analysis of the conditions set by the Directive and their comparison with the ones posed by the national labour migration schemes - in particular in Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands -, this paper aims to demonstrate that the causes of failure are not to search in the Blue Card instrument per se, but rather in the ways this has been implemented in the single Member States...|$|E

The European Commission discourse on labour migration is emphasised as well as the reactions of other actors, in particular the Member States.

40|$|Immigration {{policies}} have been for long developed {{at the national level}} by sovereign States, seeking to determine under what conditions they allowed the entry of foreigners into their territories and their stay. European integration has allowed other actors than national governments to intervene in the control of immigration particularly since the signature of the Amsterdam Treaty. The Europeanization of migration policies is highly relevant topic (Geddes, 2001, Guiraudon, 2000) but research often focused on immigration control and securitization (Guild, 2001). The aim of this research is to examine new discourse that has progressively emerged {{since the end of the}} 1990 s and that promotes a relative openness to labour immigration (Boswell, 2003). I examine the development of this discourse at the European level and its consequences in terms of policy change in order to answer the following question: why and how the European Commission has endorsed a discourse favourable to new immigration of workers in Europe after decades of doctrine of zero immigration and in despite of restrictive positions of the Member States? For this, I scrutinize the policy-making of a European labour immigration policy from the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty (1 st May 1999) until the adoption of the Council Directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third country nationals for the purposes of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>employment</b> also called Blue Card Directive (29 th May 2009). Methodologically, the research is based on the analysis of more than 400 documents from EU institutions mainly and on 37 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders involved in the European policy-making and finally on several hours of observatory participation. Based on the theoretical framework of discursive institutionalism (Schmidt, 2008), the dissertation explains the policy process carried out by European actors, particularly the European Commission and Direction General Justice and Home Affairs. Using the concept of discourse defined as ideas and interactions, it examines the ideas about new labour migration in Europe. It highlights the European policy-making on labour migration and how European actors reached step by step an agreement on the so-called Blue Card Directive. The dissertation shows that the European Commission - whatever the ideas it promotes - seeks primarily to legitimize its activities and position itself as a supranational actor and strengthen the competencies under the Treaties. Migrant workers categories emerging from the policy process range from the new economic migrant to the emblematic highly skilled worker who is seen as the ideal migrant. The common labour migration policy that was finally adopted leaves the Community door ajar. It is characterized by a differentiated approach and a preference for temporary immigration...|$|E

Parham, Department of Counseling, 					Higher Education and Special Education 	This study {{examined}} the relationship between the percentage of classes taught by <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) and students' academic achievement, as measured by students' passing rates on Maryland's High School Assessment (HSA), and graduation rates among secondary students for three academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013) in the State of Maryland. All data relating to <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers and students' academic achievement and graduation rates was collected from the Maryland's Annual Report Cards, published by Maryland State Department of Education for all 24 school systems in the State of Maryland during three consecutive academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013). The individuals in this sample were 10 th, 11 th and 12 th grade students from Maryland School System who participated in the Spring Maryland High School Assessment (HSA) for academic school years 2011, 2012 and 2013. A linear regression method was used to answer the question of possible relationships between the dependent variables, academic achievement test scores and graduation rates, and the independent variable, percent of courses taught by <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers. System level performance data were analyzed in a descriptive fashion in order to show the percent of students passing each of the Maryland High School Assessments (HSA) in Math, Biology and English, and the percent of students graduating from high school. In addition to the descriptive statistics, Hierarchical Linear Modeling analyses were conducted in order to determine if (1) students performed better on High School Assessments (HSA) in counties having more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (noted as Between Counties) and (2) if students performed better in years when there were more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) in a county, than in those years when there were fewer <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (noted as Within-Counties or Between Years). 	Results of the data indicated that between-county or counties with more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) than counties with fewer <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers had a higher percentage of students who passed the Biology 10, 11 and 12, English 10, 11 and 12, and Math 10, 11, and 12 High School Assessments (HSA), over three consecutive academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013). Within-counties, between-years or years when there were more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) in a county compared to years when there were fewer (HQT) teachers, there was no significant relationships between the percentage of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers and students passing rates on the Biology 11 and 12, the Math 10 and 12, and the English 10 and 11 High School Assessments (HSA). However, for Biology 10, Math 11 and English 12 there was a significant relationship between the percentage of HQT in a county in a year, and the percentage of students passing the test that year. Counties where there were more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT), a higher proportion of students graduated than in counties where there were fewer <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT), over three academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013). There was no relationship between the percentage of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) within a county in a particular school year and the percentage of students graduating in that year...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teacher {{provision}} {{is one of}} the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001. The term <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) comes from the original language of Title II (Preparing, Training, and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals) of the No Child Left Behind Act. Title II of NCLB designates federal funds to educational agencies for the purpose of improving the student achievement through the professional development of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers and principals. To qualify for this funding, states must comply with a series of conditions stipulated in NCLB, and track their progress toward goals each state sets. Title II was originally known as the Eisenhower Professional Development Program, and has undergone several reauthorizations, though the original intent has remained relatively intact. The main goals of the <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teacher {{provision is}} to ensure that every classroom is staffed by a teacher deemed [...] "highly qualified" [...] under conditions set by NCLB. As some point out (e.g., Eric Hanushek), this section of NCLB is quite at odds with the general thrust of NCLB because it focuses on school inputs rather than student outcomes. The sections of NCLB designated to HQTs allocates the majority of the funds to the states and does not clearly define at the federal level what is and what is not a <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teacher, allowing for more local definitions of this term. This provision has come under much scrutiny, as it is up to states to decide how to measure <b>highly</b> <b>qualified,</b> and states are not holding their teachers to the same level of rigor across the country. Since its reauthorization in 2001, Title II has yet to reach its stated goal of ensuring that 100% of teachers in public schools in the United States are <b>highly</b> <b>qualified.</b>|$|R
