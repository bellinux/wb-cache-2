50|$|The {{site was}} chosen as the {{research}} site because the granite in the area has the highest heat flow in England (120 milliwatts per square metre). The trials began in 1977 {{in the wake of the}} 1973 oil crisis and an earlier trial in the United States at Fenton Hill. It concluded in 1980, although studies continued until 1991. Funding for the initial project was provided by the Department of Energy (now the Department of Trade and Industry) and by the European Commission. The research facilities and staff transferred to Camborne School of Mines Associates Limited in 1992, the trading arm of the Camborne School of Mines.The project had two aims 1) To see if <b>hot</b> <b>dry</b> <b>rocks</b> could be fractured by water pressure alone, enabling a current of cold water from an inlet borehole to pass easily through the mass and to be collected at an outlet borehole some distance away. The trial proved to be successful, and showed that explosives were not required to fracture this Cornish hot granite at depth.2)To find out if the rocks were hot enough to make steam for a turbine to generate electricity.This second aim was not achieved at the depths attained. Though the rocks did yield substantial quantities of hot water, to reach a temperature to generate steam hot enough to drive a turbine would have required drilling a further kilometre or more into the granite, an option which was too expensive to pursue at that time.|$|E

Heat is exploited using water as working fluid as follows: the HDR is stimulated to produce fractures by the injected fluids, which run through the permeable pathways made in the rock, collecting heat which is then extracted via production wells.|$|E

40|$|Temperature {{differences}} between the hot interior of the Earth and its cold surface, estimated {{at the level of}} 3, 000 - 6, 200 °C, renders the flow of geothermic heat with average density of about 63 mW/m 2.

Vein alteration, ascribed to paleohydrothermal systems, developed within the hydrothermally altered and highly fractured zones, transforming primary biotite and plagioclase into clay minerals. One of these zones at 2. 2 km depth produced a hot-water outflow during coring, indicating the existence of a hydrothermal reservoir.

Hydrothermal, geopressure and <b>hot</b> <b>dry</b> <b>rock</b> are the three principal types of geothermal resources (in order of technological readiness) which can supply large amounts of energy for electric power production and direct heat applications. Hydrothermal resources include water and steam trapped in fractured or porous rocks. A hydrothermal system is classified as either hot-water or vapor-dominated (steam), according to the principal physical state of the fluid.

In these cases however, the walls of the fracture were modelled as being impermeable. In this paper, we have extended our previous work on fractures with permeable walls, and we introduce a correction factor to the equation that governs fracture permeability. The solution shows that the effective fracture permeability for fractures with permeable walls depends not only on the height of the channel, but also on the wall permeability and the wall Reynolds number of the fluid. We show that our solution reduces to the established solution when the fracture walls become impermeable.

The sedimentary formations (from Vendian upto Quaternary) lie ontop of the Precambrian basement rocks. According to the depth of basement three large tectonic structures are determined in the territory of Lithuania: the Baltic Syneclise (Craton) and its slope, the Mosurian-Belarusian Anteclise, and the Latvian Saddle. Research of geothermal energy started in 1988. First of all (since year 1994) the shallow geothermal resources have been used in developing individual heating systems with heat pumps. The geothermal resources up to 100 meters depth are very attractive. It is very easy to use: they are spread everywhere and are renewable. The main deep-hydrothermal resources are related to aquifers of regional Cambrian and Devonian. Usage of geothermal resources from Devonian for the centralize heating started at 2000.

In this paper, different types of geothermal resources are assessed to screen reservoirs suitable for geological storage and heat mining by CO 2 injection, in terms of geological properties, heat characteristics, storage applicability, and development prospects, etc. Deep saline aquifer, geopressured reservoir and hot dry rock are selected as the potential sites, mainly due to their relatively positive geological conditions for CO 2 circulation and storage. Reservoir simulations are conducted to analyze the storage efficiency and heat extracting capacity of CO 2 in the promising geothermal reservoirs. A simple calculation method is presented to estimate the potentials of CO 2 storage and heat mining in the major prospective geothermal regions of China.

40|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} usually {{perceived}} to be about gushing geysers and bubbling mud pools and limited to only the small volcanically active parts of the Earth’s surface. Nothing {{could be further from}} the truth. Geothermal energy is in fact an incredible store of energy found in all parts of the world which is beginning to be understood and used for our sustainable future. There are two basic forms of this energy. One form (sometimes referred to as <b>hot</b> <b>dry</b> <b>rocks</b> or enhanced geothermal systems), makes use of the heat (> 200 °C) in the rocks at depths of up to about 5 kms to produce electricity from extracted (but returnable) hot water. There are several locations around the world where “proof of concept” stage has been or about to be reached suggesting that within the next few years, these systems may be providing a significant proportion of our base-load electricity. The other form makes use of the heat (and the cooling potential) of the soils and rocks within the upper few tens of metres from the surface to heat and cool buildings. It involves the circulation of a fluid through pipes built into building foundations or in specifically drilled boreholes, and back to the surface where heat stored in the fluid is extracted by a heat pump, and used to heat a building. The cooled fluid is reinjected into the ground loops to heat up again to complete the cycle. In cooling mode, the system is reversed with heat taken out of the building transferred to the fluid which is injected underground to dump the extra heat to the ground. The cooled fluid then returns to the heat pump to receive more heat. There are many thousands of these systems installed around the world but many counties have been slow to pick up on their enormous potential. The paper explains how these systems work and looks at some of the issues which require attention in the near future for geothermal energy to become a truly sustainable, renewable and most importantly, continuous, energy source...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The present {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with geothermal energy and specifically focuses on engineered geothermal systems (EGS), which are among a portfolio of technology options for power generation from geothermal resources. In this cyclic approach (also known as hot-dry-rocks or enhanced geothermal systems), high pressure water (i. e. "geofluid") is first pumped down a borehole (known as injection well) into a bed of hot fractured rock and forced to travel through the bed, capturing the heat content of the rocks. The hot water is then extracted from a second borehole (known as production well) and sent into a binary power plant, where its thermal energy is converted to electricity. The cooled water exiting the power plant is then injected back into the ground to resume the cycle. The aim of this thesis is to advance the understanding of CO₂ based EGS power generation process and verify the merits of using CO₂ rather than water for heat extraction from fractured <b>hot</b> <b>dry</b> <b>rocks.</b> The work has been largely driven by the suitable thermodynamic and transport properties of supercritical CO₂ (scCO₂), {{which makes it a}} desirable candidate for harnessing geothermal energy from <b>hot</b> <b>dry</b> <b>rocks,</b> particularly in regions where water resources are scarce. However, {{only a limited number of}} studies were carried out in the past to assess the viability of the CO₂ based EGS concept. Most of these studies were theoretical examinations of the heat extraction and exergy analysis under a limited range of operational parameters. In addition, research work on the fluid-rock interactions relevant to CO₂ based EGS is also limited and needs further investigation. The present thesis addresses the above knowledge gaps through a combined experimental and theoretical study, resulting to an accurate description of the entire CO₂ based EGS power generation process encompassing the reservoir, wellbore and power plant cycle as well as the fluid-rock geochemical interaction. The specific objectives of the project underlying this thesis were: (1) model development and simulation of the entire CO₂ and H₂O based EGS and the associated power plant cycles, (2) optimisation studies and sensitivity analysis of operating and design parameters affecting CO₂ and H₂O based EGS performance, (3) performance comparison of CO₂ based EGS and H₂O based EGS under the same operating and reservoir conditions, (4) examination of the effect of reservoir parameters on both CO₂ and H₂O based EGS concepts through detailed 3 D reservoir simulations, (5) design and fabrication of a fluid-rock interaction apparatus capable of simulating EGS conditions, and (6) experimental investigation of the fluid-rock interactions at reservoir conditions and its likely impact on the performance characteristics of CO₂ and H₂O based EGS. One dimensional (1 D), 2 D, and 3 D models of integrated reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle were developed to provide an overall description of fluid flow in fractured reservoir (channel flow) and in radial fluid flow in homogeneous porous media. It was also created to investigate " 3 D effects" as well as transient changes during the power generation process. The thermosiphon power generation process was used in CO₂ based EGS model simulations while the Organic Rankine Cycle binary plant with isopentane as the working fluid was employed in the H₂O based EGS simulations. Mass and energy balance equations associated with the integrated 1 D and 2 D reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle model simulations were solved using the Engineering Equation Solver (EES). In the integrated 3 D reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle modelling, the transient geofluid mass and heat flow rates in the reservoir were simulated using TOUGH 2 /ECO 2 N software packages while the wellbore flow and power plant cycle calculations were carried out using EES. The use of TOUGH 2 /ECO 2 N was validated and calibrated by replicating the results of prior studies done by Pruess (2008) where TOUGH 2 /EOSM simulator was used. A fluid-rock interaction apparatus with titanium made wetted components was designed and fabricated to conduct batch and flow-through experimental studies of rock samples with CO₂ and H₂O at pressures up to 50 MPa and temperatures up to 400 °C. Surface granite from Moonbi near New England Highway, NSW and drill core samples from Mossgiel 1 and Nambucurra 1 boreholes at Murray-Darling Basin, NSW were collected and used as representatives of hot-dry-rock (HDR) EGS reservoir rock formations. The granite samples were pulverised and analysed for particle size distribution as well aselement (fused-bead XRF) and mineral (Rietveld quantitative XRD) compositions prior to any experiments. Fluid-rock interaction experiments were conducted for up to 15 days at different simulated reservoir pressures (20 and 35 MPa) and temperatures(200 and 250 °C). Fluid effluents were analysed using ICP-OES, and the reacted pulverised granite samples were subjected to further XRF, XRD, and SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis. The following are the key findings of the integrated 1 D/ 2 D reservoir-wellbore-power simulations: • The mass flow rate of CO₂ has an inverse relation with the injection temperature in a CO₂ based EGS while there is a direct relationship between the mass flow rate of water and injection temperature in CO₂ based EGS. These contrasting behaviours can be assigned to the fact that an increase in the injection temperature lowers the CO₂ density and hence increases its dynamic viscosity whereas in the case of water, an increase in the injection temperature lowers H₂O kinematic viscosity and thereby decreases the dynamic viscosity. • Reservoir pressure loss is generally higher for H₂O than for CO₂ because of the higher H₂O kinematic viscosity. • CO₂ overall mass flow rate is higher than that of H₂O due to lower average CO₂ kinematic viscosity at reservoir conditions. • Wellbore frictional loss of CO₂ is greater than that of H₂O due to the lower average CO₂ density along the length of the wellbore. • Heat extraction rates of H₂O based EGS is generally higher than those of CO₂ based EGS due to higher specific heat capacity of water. • The thermal siphoning is not practical for H₂O based EGS because the production pressure is usually lower than the injection pressure. • Power generation output of H₂O based EGS are higher than that of CO₂ based EGS and increases almost linearly as injection pressure increases while CO₂ based EGS power output shows a parabolic trend. These were found to be due to the dependency of CO₂ thermodynamic properties on pressure while H₂O thermodynamic properties are almost independent of pressure. • Reservoir temperature does not influence the overall CO₂ mass flow rate, but CO₂ heat extraction rate increases as reservoir temperature increases due to increase in the specific enthalpy change. • The maximum power generation of CO₂ based EGS decreases as reservoir pressure decreases due to lower CO₂ production pressure in the wellhead. • For both CO₂ and H₂O based EGS, shorter injection to production well distance gives higher fluid mass flow rate due to the increase in pressure gradient (pressure drop/distance) between the injection and production wells. • As the ratio of production to injection well increases, the CO₂ based EGS power generation output increases due to diminishing CO₂ frictional loss in individual production well as the number of production well increases. • CO₂ based EGS generally performs better in low permeability reservoirs (typically one order of magnitude decrease in reservoir permeability decreases CO₂ mass flow rates by 27 % while H₂O mass flow rates decreases by 67 %). • The overall thermal efficiency at any specified injection and reservoir conditions is constant regardless of CO₂ mass flow rate. Batch and flow-through CO₂-rock interaction experiments show that Ca, Fe, Mg, Al, and Si dissolve in scCO₂, which was found to be partly due to the presence of H₂O in the CO₂ stream leaked from the piston accumulator. Geochemical model simulations show that aqueous Si concentration is in equilibrium with the rock minerals after 1 day exposure in the batch experiment. The log of (Na/K) ratios shows the preferential dissolution of albite over k-feldspar. The SEM image analysis of the treated granites shows signs of erosion (i. e. rounded edges and pebble-like surfaces), which is considered to be due to the formation of carbonates in the surface and its subsequent erosion and dissolution (particularly Na₂CO₃ and K₂CO₃) to the fluid. The XFR analysis of the untreated and treated pulverised granites shows very small changes to SiO₂, Al₂O₃, CaO, MgO, Fe₂O₃, Na₂O, and K₂O major oxide compositions consistent with the ICP-OES analytical results. The Na-K-Mg ternary diagram of the data collected from the fluid-rock experiments shows that the aqueous fluid is far from the equilibrium. The presence and/or absence of minerals (hornblende or chlorite) in the starting material influences the log of (Na/K) ratios. Hornblende alters or converts to chlorite in the CO₂-H₂O mixture. Moreover, the concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Fe decreases with time, which is considered to be due to the formation of a passive layer of insoluble carbonate minerals in the surface, thus preventing further fluid-rock interaction. The pressure loss data collected during the flow-through fluid-rock interaction experiments validate the theory that CO₂ has lower reservoir loss than H₂O. The data also validate the correlation between particle size and intrinsic permeability, which predicts that at the same fluid mass flow rate, a medium with a larger particle size has a lower pressure loss...|$|E

New cars have several computers and sensing capabilities built in, including anti-lock braking systems (ABS), automatic lights that turn on in dark areas, and automatic windscreen wipers that detect rain. Most of us have mobile phones with an integrated camera, and GPS and electronic gyros are now standard extras. We can now even use small robots to automatically vacuum-clean the floor when we’re not home. All of these devices and their ability to collect data pose a challenging and unprecedented question – the so-called Big Data question. That is, we’ve now got more data at our fingertips than ever before, but how do we make sense of it? More is more? While more data is being created than ever before, the availability of information does not necessarily ensure good or efficient use of such devices and the data they collect. In addressing the Big Data question we need to consider several factors, including: how we can combine information from different sources in a computational manner to maximise performance how we can construct statistical representations of the world that account for scientific uncertainty how we can make collaborative decisions that take into account the inherent uncertainties and multiple goals of data-intensive problems While the amount of data collected at a consumer level is staggering, there is a greater imperative to understand and make use of Big Data in the industrial world. In big industries – such as mining and energy – better use of available information could lead to greater efficiencies.

If we can use the data from better sensors to minimise the amount of drilling necessary to locate the HDRs, it would reduce the overall financial costs and resource use for geothermal exploration. To tackle this problem, myself and my fellow researchers from NICTA and the School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney are working closely with the Earth Schools at Australian National University, University of Melbourne and University of Adelaide to develop machine-learning techniques – a branch of AI – to maximise the usage of information from multiple sources. We do this by combining multiple sets of data into one single statistical model. Take geothermal exploration, for example. Immense quantities of data are available from across the country, datasets that consist of geophysical surveys and drilling data, collected over several decades. They typically contain data about the concentration of radioactive minerals such as thorium, uranium and potassium, data about changes in the magnetic field, and data from the changes in the earth’s gravitational field. When combined, these datasets contain several terabytes of information. Our biggest challenge is to design efficient algorithms that extract relevant information from geophysical surveys and drilling data, to infer the geothermal potential of regions at least 5 km below the surface. This is a representation of a 3 D gravity inversion, which is an algorithm to estimate the density of underlying rock from measurements of gravity on the surface. The shapes are isosurfaces of fixed density. Higher density areas are red and lower density areas are blue. Note that this image is ‘Upside-down’ in the sense that the surface of the earth is at the bottom. Lachlan McCalman/Geoscience Australia As mentioned, this technique relies on modern statistical machine learning. In particular, “nonparametric Bayesian approaches” – statistical computer analyses that can automatically find and “learn” relationships between complex and changing sets of data and estimate the uncertainty associated with them. The advantage of creating one statistical computer model that can process all this information is the ability to model the interdependencies between different data sets simultaneously. This could reduce uncertainty and therefore the risks associated with data gathering and drilling. The ability of intelligent systems within devices to constantly update their understanding about the environment by collecting and analysing complicated data sets will become essential as they become more common and interact more closely with people. And while we may not have all the answers to the Big Data question, our method of processing multi-modal information could become the next foundation for advances in geothermal exploration. Who knows how it could also alter our use of consumer-generated data. Fabio Ramos receives funding from the ARC through the Discovery Early Career Researcher Award program.
