5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects, and it is reasonable to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> would be expected from how common it is.|$|E

5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Osteopathic {{physicians}} have historically entered primary care fields at a <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> their M.D. counterparts. Some osteopathic organizations make claims {{to a greater}} emphasis on the importance of primary care within osteopathic medicine. However, the proportion of osteopathic students choosing primary care fields, like that of their M.D. peers, is declining. Currently, only one in five osteopathic medical students enters a family medicine residency (the largest primary care field). In 2004, only 32% of osteopathic seniors planned careers in any primary care field; this percentage was down from a peak in 1996 of more than 50%.|$|E
5|$|The first stealth liposomes were passively {{targeted}} at tumor tissues. Because tumors induce rapid and uncontrolled angiogenesis they are especially “leaky” and allow liposomes {{to exit the}} bloodstream at a much <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> normal tissue would. More recently work has been undertaken to graft antibodies or other molecular markers onto the liposome surface {{in the hope of}} actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type.

40|$|When a woman kills her husband, it {{is almost}} always an {{unplanned}} action of self-de-fense against a battering husband or a last-ditch attempt to survive a batterer’s tyr-anny. Younger, reproductive-age women are battered and killed by husbands at <b>higher</b> <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> are older, postreproductive-age women. Because husband killing occurs {{in the context of}} self-defense or as a last-ditch effort to survive, reproductive-age women should kill their husbands at <b>higher</b> <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> do postreproductive-age women. I used a sample of 8, 077 husband killings to test this hypothesis. Results support the hypothesis and document that (1) the <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> of husband killing are for the youngest women, (2) the youngest husbands are at greatest risk of being killed by their wives, (3) women married to older men kill their husbands at <b>higher</b> <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> do women married to same-age men and women married to younger men, and (4) reproductive-age women kill their husbands at <b>higher</b> <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> do postreproductive-age women across two groups: women married to younger men and women married to older men.

5|$|Silk weaving is the {{dominant}} industry in Varanasi. Muslims are the influential community in this industry with {{nearly half a million}} of them working as weavers, dyers, sari finishers, and salespersons. Weaving is typically done within the household, and most weavers are Momin Ansari Muslims. Varanasi is known throughout India for its production of very fine silk and Banarasi saris, brocades with gold and silver thread work, which are often used for weddings and special occasions. The production of silk often uses bonded child labour, though perhaps not at a <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> elsewhere in India. The silk weaving industry has recently been threatened by the rise of power looms and computer-generated designs and by competition from Chinese silk imports.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} the {{formation}} of the 4th Brigade in England, in response to a request made by the British War Office to the New Zealand government for another infantry division. Although their numbers were insufficient for a new division, personnel from New Zealand were arriving in the various NZEF depots in Europe at a much <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> they were being lost from the division due to casualties and attrition. By early 1917, there was a reserve of around 10,000 men available with which to draw upon for the new brigade without adversely affecting the ability to replace existing troops in the field, in the short term at least. The brigade's core units were four infantry battalions designated as the 3rd Battalions of the Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury and Otago Regiments. Newly promoted Brigadier General Herbert Ernest Hart was appointed by Godley as the brigade's commander, and after a rigorous training programme, curtailed by orders to report to France, it embarked for the front on 29 May 1917. With four infantry brigades, the New Zealand Division was now the strongest Dominion formation fighting in France with 20,000 personnel. However, Russell did not like his division's four-brigade structure (the remainder of the British and Dominion infantry divisions had three brigades) as he continually had to fend off requests to use the extra brigade for labouring work in the corps rear area.|$|E

50|$|Audio {{amplifier}} {{power ratings}} are typically established by driving the {{device under test}} to the onset of clipping, to a predetermined distortion level, variable per manufacturer or per product line. Driving an amplifier to 1% distortion levels will yield a <b>higher</b> <b>rating</b> <b>than</b> driving it to 0.01% distortion levels. Similarly, testing an amplifier at a single mid-range frequency, or testing just one channel of a two-channel amplifier, will yield a <b>higher</b> <b>rating</b> <b>than</b> if it is tested throughout its intended frequency range with both channels working. Manufacturers can use these methods to market amplifiers whose published maximum power output includes some amount of clipping {{in order to show}} higher numbers.|$|R
