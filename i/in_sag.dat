25|$|When a {{piece of}} {{lithosphere}} that was heated and stretched cools again, its density rises, causing isostatic subsidence. If this subsidence continues long enough, the basin is called a sag basin. Examples of sag basins are the regions along passive continental margins, but sag basins {{can also be found}} in the interior of continents. <b>In</b> <b>sag</b> basins, the extra weight of the newly deposited sediments is enough to keep the subsidence going in a vicious circle. The total thickness of the sedimentary infill in a sag basins can thus exceed 10km.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-2000s, {{several of}} the {{developers}} of BCG, including Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, Ivan Sag and Laura Michaelis, collaborated {{in an effort to}} improve the formal rigor of BCG and clarify its representational conventions. The result was Sign Based Construction Grammar (SBCG). SBCG is based on a multiple-inheritance hierarchy of typed feature structures. The most important type of feature structure in SBCG is the sign, with subtypes word, lexeme and phrase. The inclusion of phrase within the canon of signs marks a major departure from traditional syntactic thinking. In SBCG, phrasal signs are licensed by correspondence to the mother of some licit construct of the grammar. A construct is a local tree with signs at its nodes. Combinatorial constructions define classes of constructs. Lexical class constructions describe combinatoric and other properties common to a group of lexemes. Combinatorial constructions include both inflectional and derivational constructions. SBCG is both formal and generative; while cognitive-functional grammarians have often opposed their standards and practices to those of formal, generative grammarians, there is in fact no incompatibility between a formal, generative approach and a rich, broad-coverage, functionally based grammar. It simply happens that many formal, generative theories are descriptively inadequate grammars. SBCG is generative in a way that prevailing syntax-centered theories are not: its mechanisms are intended to represent all of the patterns of a given language, including idiomatic ones; there is no 'core' grammar in SBCG. SBCG a licensing-based theory, as opposed to one that freely generates syntactic combinations and uses general principles to bar illicit ones: a word, lexeme or phrase is well formed if and only if it is described by a lexeme or construction. Recent SBCG works have expanded on the lexicalist model of idiomatically combining expressions sketched out <b>in</b> <b>Sag</b> 2012.|$|E
30|$|In {{recent years}} much {{progress}} has been made in tight oil exploration of the Permian Lucaogou (LCG) Formation, which is the primary exploratory stratum of tight oil reservoirs <b>in</b> the Jimsar <b>Sag,</b> Junggar Basin, Northwestern China. Jimsar Sag is located at the eastern uplift of Junggar Basin and covers an area of 1278  km 2. The Lucaogou Formation <b>in</b> Jimsar <b>Sag,</b> which formed <b>in</b> the sedimentary environment of a lacustrine basin, is a set of mixed fine-grained deposits. Mudstones, siltstones, sandstones, and dolomites are the main rock types with the characteristics of fine grains, thin single layers, and frequently alternating lithology (Si et al. 2013; Li et al. 2014). Although the LCG Formation generally has low porosity and low permeability, the physical properties and oil-bearing probability in some intervals are relatively better. Tight oil is widely distributed <b>in</b> Jimsar <b>Sag,</b> <b>in</b> which commercial oil with high production has been obtained in multiple wells and has a great prospecting potential (Kuang et al. 2012, 2013 a, b).|$|R

40|$|Continuous steel-concrete {{composite}} girders are extensively {{used for}} construction of short and medium span bridges. <b>In</b> the <b>sagging</b> regions, where the compressed flange of the steel beam {{is connected to the}} reinforced concrete slab, the cross sections generally belong to class 1 or class 2 (compact sections) and plastic design is acceptable. In the hogging regions the cross sections commonly belong to class 3 or class 4 (slender sections), thus there is insufficient ductility for plastic design and elastic verification is required. However, in this combined design approach that uses the cross section plastic resistance <b>in</b> the <b>sagging</b> regions and the elastic resistance in the hogging regions, the design must satisfy the condition that the plastic moment <b>in</b> the <b>sagging</b> region can develop while still leaving the bending moment resisted by the hogging regions sufficiently far from the elastic limit.
