One cool Chicago weekend, fortified with coffee and donuts, we trudged out onto the Lake Shore Drive median in the dawn’s early light to witness a free if bitter spectacle of the turn-of-the-century United States, the destruction by implosion {{of one of the}} buildings of the Lakefront Properties high-rise apartments, among the city’s notoriously troubled large-scale housing projects. People had lived there—many, despite years of crime, neglect, and problems with the police and with the lack of police, did not want to leave—but urban planners and city government had moved on. And so, we returned home covered in cement dust from what had almost unanimously become a symbol of urban dysfunction, though from that agreement etiological arguments might diverge into discussions of bureaucratic pathology, “the gangs”, de facto segregation and racism, or the evils of modernist overconfidence.

2500|$|As {{complaints}} about the city subway's delays and disrepair reached a fever pitch in summer 2017 under state governor Andrew Cuomo, he drafted a congestion pricing proposal with lessons from Bloomberg's handling of the State Legislature. Despite having earlier doubted such a plan's viability, Cuomo described congestion pricing as [...] "an <b>idea</b> <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> come". London and Stockholm had implemented the concept successfully. Cuomo's plan is expected to differ significantly from Bloomberg's proposal. Its primary intent is {{to raise funds for}} city transit and reduce street gridlock, while balancing suburban commuter considerations. The New York Times reflected that Bloomberg's 2008 proposal, which would have raised $500 million annually, could have rectified infrastructure issues and emergency repair schedule affecting the subway in 2017. The plan could be implemented through open road tolling, which records E-ZPass transponders and license plates without forcing the vehicles to slow down significantly, thus increasing vehicle throughput. This would coincide with MTA Bridges and Tunnels' ongoing project to convert all of its crossings from a tollbooth-based system to an open road tolling system. This was in contrast to the circumstances during Bloomberg's tenure, when open road tolling was not widely used yet. As with the Bloomberg proposal, Queens politicians still opposed Cuomo's proposal because it would potentially add tolls to the remaining free crossings over the East River.|$|E

Several people have told me that they had the same idea at the same time, but were afraid to say so in public because it seemed such a radical idea then. As soon as Claude Shannon's work appeared in 1948, there were bound to be readers who were already familiar with the work of Gibbs and Jeffreys.

40|$|The {{announcement}} in November 2012 by the Minister of Justice of plans to recruit volunteering organisations as indispensable to his ‘rehabilitation revolution’ crystallised several favoured policy {{themes of the}} coalition government. The speech confirmed the special status that voluntary sector organisations (VSOs) had assumed in governmental thinking about resettling and managing offenders. The proposition that civic-minded volunteers could salvage offenders from lives of crime on a widespread scale was fêted as an <b>idea</b> <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> <b>had</b> come. That appeal resonated with the Big Society project, which promulgated the idea that civil society could play an important, and sometimes more successful, role than the state in tackling entrenched social problems, including crime (Norman, 2010). Within this paradigm, it is claimed that properly trained {{members of the community}} and even former lawbreakers are singularly well placed to help offenders to turn their lives around where the prisons and probation system are deemed to have failed (Carter, 2003; Le Grand, 2007). However, underlying the appeal to socially responsible citizenship was the more sombre warning that discharging offenders back to homelessness, social isolation or substance addiction without help would perpetuate their reoffending, to the eventual cost of public safety: Solving these problems requires a radically different approach. Our central objective is to make the public safer by breaking the cycle of crime. (Ministry of Justice, 2010 : 7, s 15...|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{fertilization}} process breaks down into three essential components: induction of ovulation, fertilization of the oocyte, and development of embryos that are transferred into the uterus. Problems may arise resulting in failure at {{any one of these}} junctions. In 1984, the World Congress on In Vitro Fertilization was held, looking at 9, 641 laparoscopies yielding 1, 101 clinical pregnancies, with an overall pregnancy rate of 11 percent [...] clearly indicating that {{in vitro fertilization}}/embryo transfer (IVF/ET) was an <b>idea</b> <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> <b>had</b> come. Ovulation induction is monitored by both the use of ultrasound and daily estradiol levels, ultrasound indicating the number of oocytes that will be available for capture, and estradiol indicating in an indirect way the quality of those oocytes. It is a major aim in each patient to obtain at least four embryos, since this optimizes success rates. Ovulation induction at Yale is carried out with a high-dose human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) /human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) regimen. This regimen has insured us a success rate of 17 percent clinical pregnancies per laparoscopy. In the future, modification will occur in the process with cryopreservation of oocytes and embryos, and gamete manipulation. The modifications will be effected primarily to increase pregnancy rates. Research will continue mainly to delineate better biochemical markers for oocyte quality, but also to further explain the mystery of implantation...|$|R

More than just escapist entertainment, TV reveals the dynamism and diversity of everyday life in the United States and the evolving nature of the nation’s core values. Television is moreover in a continual state of change and renewal. Its history has developed through a prehistory (before 1948) to a network era (1948 – 1975), a cable era (1976 – 1994), and finally the current digital era (1995 –present). Today there are more than 650 networks in the U. S. marketplace whereby members of the typical domestic household receive 189 channels and watch more than eight hours of TV a day on average. TV in the 21 st century also travels anywhere at any time, given its synergistic relationship with the Internet and a wide array of digital devices. It is now increasingly personalized, interactive, mobile, and on demand. Television is presently a convergent technology, a global industry, a viable art form, a public catalyst, and a complex and dynamic reflection of American society and culture...|$|R

5000|$|Founded in 1949, the ABAA is the {{benchmark}} for professionalism and ethics in the rare book {{trade in the}} US. The founding of the ABAA was {{the direct result of}} the founding of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers (ILAB) a year earlier: [...] "It was quickly recognized in the United States that national and international cooperation among booksellers was an <b>idea</b> <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> <b>had</b> come and that an American association was vital for the interests of professional booksellers." [...] An organizational meeting was held in New York City in 1949 to discuss the advisability of forming a national organization, with about 50 dealers in attendance, with Marston Drake (James F. Drake, Inc.) acting as informal chairman. The Antiquarian Bookman (later AB Bookman's Weekly) reported in its issue of 5 March 1949 that [...] "A great step forward towards the establishment of a genuine national association of antiquarian booksellers was taken" [...] at this meeting, though [...] "it was recognized that there were a great many differences, a long backlog of personal disputes and dissensions and an enormous field of individual views and prejudices" [...] to deal with. [...] "It was also recognized that all the above were some of the very reasons why a national association of antiquarian booksellers had to be formed: not merely to reconcile the differences but also to advance book-buying, to promote book-collecting, so that all would benefit from such increased activity in the book field." [...] The first general meeting of the new association took place in March, with 81 dealers in attendance; annual dues were set at $10/year. The first president of the ABAA was Laurence Gomme (Brentano's).|$|R

40|$|When President Obama closed 2014 by {{requesting}} $ 263 {{million to}} support the deployment of 50, 000 body-worn cameras (or BWCs) for state officers, he was endorsing an <b>idea</b> <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> <b>had</b> come. The deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner provided names and faces to a growing call for police accountability that would eventually develop into the broader Black Lives Matter movement. Brown’s parents themselves vigorously campaigned to place body cameras on every law enforcement officer, {{at the same time}} that polling suggested greater white outrage over Garner’s death than Brown’s—quite likely, commentators noted, due to the fact that the former was filmed. While police body-worn cameras (BWCs) are a promising tool for police accountability, expanding body camera use will come at a serious financial cost, and will require municipalities adopting these programs to make hard choices. In particular, decisions made about retention time and disclosure breadth will be crucial to the financial feasibility of any program. While the ideal program would retain BWC footage for months or even years, the cost of video storage can become prohibitive very quickly. Further, if police footage is treated as a traditional public record under state FOIA laws, departments may be faced with a choice between costly redaction, risking the release of sensitive footage, or scuttling a program altogether. This Comment asserts that footage access policies can be designed to both serve the public interest and safeguard legitimate privacy interests without breaking the bank for municipalities. The guiding principle I offer is that BWC programs must provide full footage access to the victims of suspected undue police violence and their families—allowing for an accountability baseline and setting victims’ rights as paramount. Public record policies should not impede this core goal by imposing public access where the associated costs could stymie such programs altogether...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Schwartz Center Rounds (‘Rounds’) are a {{multidisciplinary}} forum in which healthcare staff within an organisation discuss the psychological, emotional and social challenges {{associated with their}} work in a confidential and safe environment. Implemented in over 375 North American organisations, since 2009, they have been increasingly adopted in England. This study aimed to establish how many and what types of organisations have adopted Rounds in England, and to explore why they did so. Setting: Public healthcare organisations in England. Participants: Secondary data {{analysis was used to}} map and profile all 116 public healthcare organisations that had adopted Rounds in England by July 2015. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 45 Round coordinators within adopting organisations. Results: The rate of adoption increased after a major national report in 2013. Rounds were typically adopted in order to improve staff well-being. Adopting organisations scored better on staff engagement than non-adopters; among adopting organisations, those performing better on patient experience were more likely to adopt earlier. Most adoption decision-making processes were straightforward. A confluence of factors—a generally favourable set of innovation attributes (including low cost), advocacy from opinion leaders in different professional networks, active dissemination by change agents and a felt need to be seen to be addressing staff well-being—initially led to Rounds being seen as ‘an <b>idea</b> <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> <b>had</b> come’. More recent adoption patterns have been shaped by the timing of charitable and other agency funding in specific geographical areas and sectors, as well as several forms of ‘mimetic pressure’. Conclusions: The innate attributes of Rounds, favourable circumstances and the cumulative impact of a sequence of distinct informal and formal social processes have shaped the pattern of their adoption in England. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{case study}} of the early history (January, 1986, through January, 1988) of the New Hampshire Alliance for Effective Schools and its primary project, the New Hampshire School Improvement Program (SIP). The key question asked by this study is 2 ̆ 2 Why was this Alliance and its SIP an <b>idea</b> <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> <b>had</b> come? 2 ̆ 2 To investigate this question, the researcher utilized the focused synthesis approach of policy analysis outlined by Doty (1982) and Majchrzak (1984) which involves a selective review of relevant written materials and existing research as well as a synthesis of unpublished documents, memoranda and miscellaneous materials, anecdotal stories, discussions and interviews with key players. ^ The study describes seventeen key players 2 ̆ 7 visions of improved schools and their perceptions of individuals 2 ̆ 7 roles, commitments and contributions {{to the development of the}} Alliance. It suggests that this idea for education reform emerged because of a policy window created by a change in political climate and leadership, and the availability of an analogous solution [...] not because there was an explicit problem to be solved.

In addition, powerful and/or knowledgeable people were interested in 2 ̆ 2 making their mark on history 2 ̆ 2; these individuals were willing to become actively involved in this project which they envisioned as potentially successful, long-lasting and highly visible. ^ Further, the study verifies Polsby 2 ̆ 7 s notion (1984) that policy innovation is the result of the intersection of three forces: (1) the interests of various groups; (2) the intellectual convictions of experts and policymakers; and (3) comparative knowledge of the ways in which similar problems have been handled elsewhere. ...|$|R

40|$|When Merle Thornton and Ro Bognor chained {{themselves}} to the foot rail of the front bar of Brisbane’s Regatta Hotel in March 1965 to demand the legal right for women in that state to drink alongside male patrons, their actions marked a new turn {{in the history of}} feminism. As Kay Saunders observed three decades later: ‘when you use the term ‘‘second wave’’ it actually started in Brisbane’ (Saunders 1999). In a leaflet distributed in the bar that day, the two women were at pains to articulate that their primary concern was not with the exclusion of women from drinking opportunities; they were concerned with what the legislation symbolised: women’s wider exclusion from public spaces and from public life. They were staging a protest for equal citizenship, a demand that underpinned much of Thornton’s subsequent career as a feminist activist. As she later recalled: ‘What we did at the Regatta represented an <b>idea</b> <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> <b>had</b> come. It was the idea of ending the confinement of women to the private domestic sphere’ (Thornton 2007, 51). We have recently completed a project focused on securing Thornton’s personal papers for the National Library of Australia (NLA). Our desire to undertake this project was driven by recognition that the conditions of possibility for researching the history of Australia’s second-wave women’s movement and, in particular, accounts of the role of activists within it are determined in no small part by the movement’s archival legacy. Her papers represent a valuable addition to the current records of that movement, not least in how they document early grassroots feminist activism taking place outside the more familiar south-eastern axis of Sydney Canberra Melbourne. The project was undertaken with the assistance of Marie-Louise Ayres and Emma Jolley of the NLA, with a consultant archivist, Jane Ellen, and with financial support from the Sidney Myer Fund and the Office of the Queensland Premier. In this respect, it was a model of what converging scholarly, institutional and philanthropic interests can sometimes achieve. The project saw Thornton’s papers professionally processed and boxed in situ at her Melbourne home and a descriptive box listing produced. In addition, we recorded an oral history interview with Thornton for inclusion in the NLA’s collection. When Thornton completes her current work a memoir the papers will be released to the Library...|$|R
