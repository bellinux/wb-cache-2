40|$|Abstract. There {{has been}} {{interest}} recently concerning when a left ordered <b>group</b> <b>is</b> locally indicable. Chiswell and Kropholler proved that every left ordered solvable-by-finite <b>group</b> <b>is</b> locally indicable, while Bergman gave examples of left ordered <b>groups</b> which <b>are</b> not locally indicable. We shall prove that every left ordered elementary amenable <b>group</b> <b>is</b> locally indicable. Every solvable-by-finite <b>group</b> <b>is</b> elementary amenable, and every elementary amenable <b>group</b> <b>is</b> amenable.

But as the grades advance, it becomes stronger and heterogeneity of subjects disappears outwardly...|$|R
5|$|Final {{preparations}} for the landings in the Brunei Bay area took place in May 1945. After shortages of shipping delayed I Corps' movement from Australia to Morotai, General Headquarters agreed on 8 May to reschedule the operation from 23 May to 10 June. The 9th Division's staff completed their plans for operations in the Brunei Bay area on 16 May. The 24th Brigade <b>Group</b> <b>was</b> assigned responsibility for capturing Labuan, and the 20th Brigade <b>Group</b> <b>was</b> tasked with securing Brunei and Muara Island. Both brigades were to land simultaneously {{on the morning of}} 10 June.
