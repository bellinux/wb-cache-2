It {{can be found}} in North America from Labrador and Newfoundland to Ontario, and south to Pennsylvania and Michigan. Erect stems can reach 20 centimeters high, and branch dichotomously. The sterile {{branches}} are flattened, and the leaves are 4-ranked. Peduncles are 1-8 centimeters long. In many disturbed sites, it can be found growing alongside D. sitchense, and can be distinguished by flattened branchlets split into four ranks, as opposed to those of D. sitchense, which generally are rounded and split into five ranks.|$|E
