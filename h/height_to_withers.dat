This research included 278 cows of Simmental breed selected into the category of bull dams on the territory of Republic of Serbia. By application of method of least squares following average values of exterior measures were obtained: <b>height</b> <b>to</b> <b>withers</b> 136, 04 cm; carcass length 165, 81 cm; breast depth 73, 61 cm; breast girth 201, 12 cm; body mass 695, 29 kg. Regions influenced statistically highly significantly all investigated exterior traits (P 0, 05) on body development of Simmental bull dams. Obtained values were considerably uniform without any greater oscillations. Key words: Simmental breed, bull dams, exterior, paragenetic factor...|$|E

The Doberman has a square frame: its length should equal its <b>height</b> <b>to</b> the <b>withers,</b> {{and the length of}} its head, neck and legs should be in proportion to its body.|$|R
50|$|The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a low-set, muscular, active, small-to-medium size hunting terrier. The {{preferred}} {{ratio of}} length of body (prosternum to point of buttocks) <b>to</b> <b>height</b> (<b>withers</b> <b>to</b> ground) is between 10:7 and 10:8. The head is broad, slightly domed, wedge-shaped, and proportionate {{to the size}} of the body. Ears are V-shaped, set at the outside edges of the skull, and may be erect or button. A docked tail is preferred, but a natural bob tail or a natural tail carried in an upward curve are also acceptable. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier comes in solid white, other solid colors with markings, and white with a variety of colored patches.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the breed}} {{standards}} vary among kennel and breed clubs, {{according to the}} FCI standard the dog typically stands between 68 to 72 cm, and The Kennel Club in the UK quote 69 cm as being ideal; the female is typically somewhere between 63 to 68 cm, 65 cm being ideal. The Doberman has a square frame: its length should equal its <b>height</b> <b>to</b> the <b>withers,</b> {{and the length of}} its head, neck and legs should be in proportion to its body.|$|R
50|$|The height at withers {{in females}} is between 45 and 55 cm. and males 50 to 60 cm. The ratio of <b>height</b> at <b>withers</b> <b>to</b> body length is almost square in males, i.e. {{the length and}} height of the body are almost equal. Females are longer than high, forming a rectangle. Males are always more voluminous than females, with a clear sexual dimorphism.|$|R
50|$|The Karst Shepherd Dog is {{of medium}} size, harmonious, robust, endowed with a {{well-developed}} musculature {{and a strong}} constitution. The tail and ears are hanging. Length of body in proportion <b>to</b> <b>height</b> at <b>withers</b> should be no less than 9 : 8. Skull is a little longer (13 to 14 cm) than the muzzle (11 to 12 cm / 4.3 to 4.7 in). Width of skull (13 to 14 cm / 5.2 to 5.5 in) is equal to its length.|$|R
5000|$|Most breeds of dog are {{at most a}} {{few hundred}} years old, having been artificially {{selected}} for particular morphologies and behaviors by people for specific functional roles. Through this selective breeding, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal. For example, <b>height</b> measured <b>to</b> the <b>withers</b> ranges from 15.2 cm in the Chihuahua to about 76 cm in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called [...] "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" [...] or [...] "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth. It is common for most breeds to shed this coat.|$|R
5000|$|At 15-17 lb (7-8 kg), {{it is the}} {{smallest}} of the long legged, black and tan terriers. The Lakeland is similar in appearance to the slightly larger Welsh Terrier and is finer-boned. The largest of the threesome in this similar group of Terriers is the Airedale. The Lakeland is a sturdy dog, compact, free moving and able to cover ground with little effort and much quickness. The dog is relatively narrow in the chest and has a broad muzzle, yet slightly narrower than the Welsh Terrier, with small, V-shaped ears.The Lakeland breed has a thick bushy wiry outer coat and a soft undercoat. It comes in a variety of colors though The Kennel Club lists the following as 'Acceptable colours for registration': Black, Black and Tan, Blue and Tan, Dark Grizzle, Grizzle, Grizzle and Tan, Liver and Tan, Red, Red Grizzle, Wheaten. [...] They have an upright tail which was previously customarily docked. Lakeland Terriers grow to between 33 and 38 cm (13 to 15 inches) in <b>height</b> measured <b>to</b> the <b>withers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Measurements of 17 body {{measures}} and 11 indices of body conformation on 209 breeding individuals of the Hucul horse {{were used to}} analyse the effect of country of origin (Poland and the Czech Republic), sex (stallions and mares), age (5 classes) and sire line (Gurgul, Goral, Oušor, Hroby, Polan, Pietrosu, Prislop). All horses were measured by one person. Measures and indexes were analysed by the GLM procedure. The main effect was the country of origin. Highly {{significant differences were found}} between both Polish and Czech horses in two thirds of measurements and in more than half of indices. The Czech Hucul horses are significantly higher, longer, wider in pelvis and have longer head than Polish horses. On the contrary to the Czech horses are Polish horses more compact, massive and have deeper chest. Their cannon bone in relation <b>to</b> <b>height</b> of <b>wither</b> is wider...|$|R
