60|$|The {{street in}} which Mr. Blunt lived {{presented}} itself to our <b>eyes,</b> <b>narrow,</b> silent, empty, and dark, but with enough gas-lamps {{in it to}} disclose its most striking feature: a quantity of flag-poles sticking out above many of its closed portals. It was the street of Consuls and I remarked to Mr. Blunt that {{coming out in the}} morning he could survey the flags of all nations almost—except his own. (The U. S. consulate {{was on the other side}} of the town.) He mumbled through his teeth that he took good care to keep clear of his own consulate.|$|E
60|$|Werper {{bent his}} head in thought. Achmet Zek stood {{awaiting}} his reply. What good remained in Albert Werper revolted {{at the thought of}} selling a white woman into the slavery and degradation of a Moslem harem. He looked up at Achmet Zek. He saw the Arab's <b>eyes</b> <b>narrow,</b> and he guessed that the other had sensed his antagonism to the plan. What would it mean to Werper to refuse? His life lay in the hands of this semi-barbarian, who esteemed the life of an unbeliever less highly than that of a dog. Werper loved life. What was this woman to him, anyway? She was a European, doubtless, a member of organized society. He was an outcast. The hand of every white man was against him. She was his natural enemy, and if he refused to lend himself to her undoing, Achmet Zek would have him killed.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seemed to}} me human beings could not have more eagerly and swiftly obeyed an order. Herky and Bill and Bud jerked their arms down and {{extended}} their hands out behind. After that quick action they again turned into statues. There was a breathless suspense in every act. And {{there was something about}} Jim Williams then that I did not like. I was in a cold perspiration for fear one of the men would make some kind of a move. As the very mention of the Texan had always caused a little silence, so his presence changed the atmosphere of that cabin room. Before his coming there had been the element of chance--a feeling of danger, to be sure, but a healthy spirit of give and take. That had all changed with Jim Williams's words [...] "Hands up!" [...] There was now something terrible hanging in the balance. I had but to look at Jim's <b>eyes,</b> <b>narrow</b> slits of blue fire, at the hard jaw and tight lips, to see a glimpse of the man who thought nothing of life. It turned me sick, and I was all in a tremor till Dick and Hiram had the men bound fast.|$|E

5000|$|M. Othon: M. Othon is a {{magistrate}} in Oran. He is {{tall and}} thin and, as Tarrou observes in his journal, [...] "his small, beady <b>eyes,</b> <b>narrow</b> nose, and hard, straight mouth make {{him look like a}} well-brought-up owl." [...] Othon treats his wife and children unkindly, but after his son dies of the plague, his character softens. After he finishes his time at the isolation camp, where he is sent because his son is infected, he wants to return there because it would make him feel closer to his lost son. However, before Othon can do this, he contracts the plague and dies.|$|E
5000|$|Bosley Crowther of The New York Times observed, [...] "Shallow, perhaps, as a {{study of}} the {{accumulation}} of power, this drama is nonetheless gripping in its expose of the intimate life of a man in his ruthless rise from poverty to fabulous position and wealth [...] [...] [...] And not only is the story intriguing in its details, but {{some of the people in}} it are consistently interesting [...] [...] [...] However, it must be acknowledged that Mr. Tracy [...] [...] [...] fails to give clear definition or consistency to this ruthless man [...] [...] [...] as Mr. Tracy plays him, he is a really decent sort who sells his soul for the sake of his beloved son and whose defection seems to haunt him for the rest of his life. His moments of hard and ruthless dealing, in which his <b>eyes</b> <b>narrow</b> coldly and his jaw sets, are heavily interlarded with gay and smiling gobs of Tracy charm. There is nothing sardonic about him. He is even dull as a personality [...] [...] [...] Say this, however, for the film folks: they haven't put Edward on the screen. That major restraint is most welcome." ...|$|E

30|$|All {{participants}} were given an initial short questionnaire in self-report format to analyze their eating behavior and physical and biochemical parameters. The {{data were collected from}} Coimbatore, Chennai, and Vellore districts in Tamil Nadu over a span of 2 [*]years from 2015 to 2017. The PWS patients were initially selected based on phenotype characteristics such as low birth weight, hypotonia, and feeding difficulties in infancy, followed by excessive appetite, obesity, small hands and feet, almond-shaped <b>eyes,</b> <b>narrow</b> bifrontal, scoliosis, short stature, and intellectual disabilities (average IQ of 65) in early childhood. The selected {{participants were}} then genetically confirmed for PWS by methylation study. The study was approved by the Institute Ethical Committee, and written, informed consent form was obtained from all the participants before beginning the study.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a 16 -year-old girl with a {{multiple}} congential anomalies/mental retardation condition, in which a 1. 7 Mb tandem duplication of chromosome region 16 p 13. 3 was detected by array-CGH. Mental retardation was moderate (IQ 45), with very limited speech. She had tall stature with relative microcephaly. Clinical manifestations included distinctive facial apperance with deep set <b>eyes,</b> <b>narrow</b> palpebral fissures, wide nasal bridge, long philtrum, rounded nasal tip, thin upper lip, protruding mandible and abnormal auricles, hand and foot anomalies. The causal 16 p 13. 3 duplication {{is one of the}} smallest reported so far, and included the CBP gene, whose haploinsufficiency is responsible for the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. By comparing clinical manifestations of our patient with those of patients carrying similar rearrangements, we coud infer that 16 p 13. 3 microduplications encompassing the Rubinstein-Taybi region resulted in a recognizable clinical condition, most likely representing a single disorder.

40|$|Figure 1. Given {{a single}} input {{photo of a}} child (far left) our method renders an image at any future age range between 1 and 80. Note the change in shape (e. g., nose gets longer, <b>eyes</b> <b>narrow)</b> and texture, while keeping the {{identity}} (and milk mustache!) of the input person. We present an approach that takes a single photograph of a child as input and automatically produces a series of age-progressed outputs between 1 and 80 years of age, ac-counting for pose, expression, and illumination. Leveraging thousands of photos of children and adults at many ages from the Internet, we first show how to compute average image subspaces that are pixel-to-pixel aligned and model variable lighting. These averages depict a prototype man and woman aging from 0 to 80, under any desired illumi-nation, and capture the differences in shape and texture be-tween ages. Applying these differences to a new photo yields an age progressed result. Contributions include relightable age subspaces, a novel technique for subspace-to-subspace alignment, and the most extensive evaluation of age pro-gression techniques in the literature 1. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of molecular karyotyping technologies into the diagnostic work-up {{of patients with}} congenital disorders permitted the identification and delineation of novel microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Interstitial 16 p 13. 3 duplication, encompassing the CREBBP gene, which is mutated or deleted in the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, have been proposed to cause a recognisable syndrome with variable intellectual disability, normal growth, mild facial dysmophism, mild anomalies of the extremities, and occasional findings such as developmental defects of the heart, genitalia, palate or the eyes. We here report the phenotypic and genotypic delineation of 9 patients carrying a submicroscopic 16 p 13. 3 duplication, including the smallest 16 p 13. 3 duplication reported so far. Careful clinical assessment confirms the distinctive clinical phenotype and also defines frequent associated features : marked speech problems, frequent ocular region involvement with upslanting of the <b>eyes,</b> <b>narrow</b> palpebral fissures, ptosis and strabismus, frequent proximal implantation of thumbs, cleft palate/bifid uvula and inguinal hernia. It also confirms that CREBBP is the critical gene involved in the duplication 16 p 13. 3 syndrome. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The DiGeorge {{syndrome}}, velo-cardio-facial {{syndrome and}} conotruncal anomaly face syndrome have similar but variable phenotypes {{and share the}} deletion of 22 q 11. 2. The 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome includes the following facial appearance: widely spaced <b>eyes,</b> <b>narrow</b> eyelids, small mouth, prominent apex nasi, flat and widened nasal dorsum. A diagnosis of this syndrome may be made based solely on facial appearance. However, a more accurate and objective evaluation is necessary as facial appearance largely depends on examiner 2 ̆ 7 s impressions. A 3 -dimensional laser scanner with a slit laser light was used to quantitatively evaluate the facial morphology of the patient, {{and the effectiveness of}} this method in diagnosing 22 q 11. 2 deletation syndrome was evaluated. Nine cases of 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome were diagnosed from 1994 to 1997 (3 males, 6 females, age range: 4 ～ 31 years). We used a 3 -dimensional curved surface measuring equipment, to measure the face 3 -dimensionally, imputing data digitally. The image obtained with this method showed a reduction in the choroid fissure, with a widened dorsum nasi and the dorsum nasi inclination angle was steeper in the apex nasi than in the radix nasi. In conclusion, the facial appearance of cases of 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome, such as reduction in the choroid fissure, a widened dorsum nasi and prominent apex nasi can be evaluated quantitatively...|$|E
