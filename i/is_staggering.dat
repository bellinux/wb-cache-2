[...] Charlie Collier, president of AMC, felt that The Walking Dead was a rarity that successfully reached its core audience as well as broadening its fanbase, saying, [...] "That The Walking Dead is now the most watched drama {{in the history of}} basic cable <b>is</b> <b>staggering,</b> just like our zombies." ...|$|E
500|$|In May, {{successive}} draws {{at home to}} Birmingham City and Portsmouth left Arsenal with 84 {{points from}} 36 games. Reyes scored the only goal of the match against Fulham; he profited from a mistake by goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar: [...] "The Dutchman tried to go past the Arsenal forward, but instead gifted possession {{and with it the}} easiest of open goals." [...] Arsenal's final game of the league season was against Leicester City. They conceded the opening goal, but turned the match around in the second half through goals from Henry and Vieira. With 26 wins, 12 draws and no defeats, the team became the first since Preston North End in 1888–89 to go through a league season undefeated. Reviewing the match and overall season, Amy Lawrence of The Observer wrote: [...] "Arsenal's achievement may not make them 'great' in everyone's opinion – those who define greatness only by European Cups, back-to-back titles, and triple cartwheels on the way to every goal – but it <b>is</b> <b>staggering</b> in its own right." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1971 Candidates matches, Fischer {{was set to}} {{play against}} Soviet {{grandmaster}} and concert pianist Mark Taimanov in the quarter-finals. [...] "Their match was to begin in May 1971 in Vancouver, Canada, on the beautiful campus of the University of British Columbia." [...] "Analysts and players alike predicted that Fischer would win the Candidates, but not without a struggle. Tal predicted that Fischer would win 5½–4½ against Taimanov." [...] " [...] saw himself as the firm favorite in the Taimanov match. He was not alone; the noncommunist press was of the same mind. Only Taimanov insisted that he could win, dismissing Fischer as a mere computer". Taimanov had reason to be confident. He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik, who [...] "had thoroughly analysed Fischer's record and put together a 'dossier' on him", from {{when he was in}} talks to play Fischer in a match [...] "a couple of years earlier". After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match, Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed {{to come up with the}} move 12. N1c3, to which Fischer replied [...] "that the idea was not his—he had come across it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote". Taimanov said of this: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>staggering</b> that I, an expert on the Sicilian, should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot, while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language!" [...] With the score at 4–0, in Fischer's favor, the fifth game adjournment was a sight to behold. Schonberg explains the scene:Taimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds, both grandmasters. Fischer was alone. He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was the funniest thing he had ever seen. There Taimanov and his seconds would sit, six hands flying, pocket sets waving in the air, while variations were being spouted all over the place. And there sat Taimanov with a confused look on his face. Just before resuming play [...] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last-minute advice. When poor Taimanov entered the playing room and sat down to confront Fischer, his head was so full of conflicting continuations that he became rattled, left a Rook en prise and immediately resigned. Fischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6–0. [...] "The record books showed that the only comparable achievement to the 6–0 score against Taimanov was Wilhelm Steinitz's 7–0 win against Joseph Henry Blackburne in 1876 in an era of more primitive defensive technique." [...] "Who would have imagined that any challenger's match would ever have been decided by a perfect score, when the participants are all to be ranked among the strongest players in the world?" [...] "It is difficult to portray to non-chess players the magnitude of such a shutout. A typical result between well-matched players might be, say, six wins to four, with nine draws". Taimanov later recalled, [...] "When Grand Masters play, they see the logic of their opponent's moves. One's moves may be so powerful that the other may not be able to stop him, but the plan behind the moves will be clear. Not so with Fischer. His moves did not make sense..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Theatre {{historian}} Gary Jay Williams {{says the}} production was so influential {{that it became}} [...] "the reference point for Shakespearean performance practice in general over the next decade". It encouraged {{the exploration of the}} play's darker, adult themes, which had been overshadowed by the tradition treating it as a play for children. So innovative and distinctive was the production that it almost became a problem for directors, because [...] "the burden of reinventing the play now fell on every director." [...] However, it opened the door to much greater experimentation, so that [...] "twenty-five years after Brook's staging, the diversity of approaches <b>is</b> <b>staggering</b> to review".|$|E

Also in August 2004, General Sir Peter Cosgrove launched the book in Canberra at the Australian War Memorial and saw Monash as a 'gripping and vibrant account of Monash's life....a riveting, compelling and accessible biography of a man of contrasts rather than contradictions.' Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett launched it in Melbourne, saying: 'The detail in this book <b>is</b> <b>staggering</b> and fascinating; the narrative is strong and well-written.

2500|$|Potts' removal could charitably be {{attributed}} to Blamey's inadequate understanding of the circumstances Potts had dealt with on the Kokoda Trail. He may have genuinely believed that another commander in the same circumstances would have pushed back the Japanese and re-taken Kokoda. This is the tack taken by Dudley McCarthy in the official war history; [...] "Blamey and Herring, who did not at that time understand so well {{the circumstances in which}} Potts found himself and the way he had acquitted himself, genuinely misjudged him". Other historians feel that Potts was a scapegoat, removed by Blamey to avoid a showdown with MacArthur. MacArthur maintained {{in a letter to the}} Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George Marshall, on 6 September that [...] "the Australians have proven themselves unable to match the enemy in jungle fighting. Aggressive leadership is lacking". Peter Brune alleges that Blamey's removal of Potts was simple self-preservation. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>staggering</b> to contemplate that an Australian brigade commander could be thrust into a campaign with such a damning inadequacy of military intelligence, support and equipment and yet fight a near flawless fighting withdrawal where the military and political stakes were so terribly important and that could then be relieved from his command as a reward." [...] General Robert Eichelberger wrote to Herring in 1959, after McCarthy's history appeared: ...|$|E

6000|$|What Villari says, for {{the purpose}} of adding rhetorical force to his [...] "brigand-chief"--that Cesare was no statesman and no soldier--is entirely of a piece {{with the rest of the}} chapter in which it occurs(1)--a chapter rich in {{sweeping}} inaccuracies concerning Cesare. But it <b>is</b> <b>staggering</b> to find the statement in such a place, amid Macchiavelli's letters on Cesare, breathing an obvious and profound admiration of the duke's talents as a politician and a soldier--an admiration which later is to go perilously near to worship. To Macchiavelli, Cesare is the incarnation of a hazy ideal, as is abundantly shown in The Prince. For Villari to reconcile all this with his own views must seem impossible. And impossible it is; yet Villari achieves it, with an audacity that leaves you breathless.|$|E

60|$|Much {{allowance}} {{is to be}} {{made for}} a man who <b>is</b> <b>staggering</b> under the mental shock of defeat and the physical exertions which Buller had endured. That the Government made such allowance is clear from {{the fact that he was}} not instantly recalled. And yet the cold facts are that we have a British General, at the head of 25,000 men, recommending another General, at the head of 12,000 men only twelve miles off, to lay down his arms to an army which was certainly very inferior in numbers to the total British force; and this because he had once been defeated, although he knew that there was still time for the whole resources of the Empire to be poured into Natal in order to prevent so shocking a disaster. Such is a plain statement of the advice which Buller gave and which White rejected. For the instant the fate not only of South Africa but even, as I believe, of the Empire hung upon the decision of the old soldier in Ladysmith, who had to resist the proposals of his own General as sternly as the attacks of the enemy. He who sorely needed help and encouragement became, as his message shows, the helper and the encourager. It was a tremendous test, and Sir George White came through it with a staunchness and a loyalty which saved us not only from overwhelming present disaster, but from a hideous memory which must have haunted British military annals for centuries to come.|$|E
60|$|I know {{of nothing}} in all drama more {{incomparable}} {{from the point}} of view of art, nothing more suggestive in its subtlety of observation, than Shakespeare's drawing of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. They are Hamlet's college friends. They have been his companions. They bring with them memories of pleasant days together. At the moment when they come across him in the play he <b>is</b> <b>staggering</b> under the weight of a burden intolerable to one of his temperament. The dead have come armed out of the grave to impose on him a mission at once too great and too mean for him. He is a dreamer, and he is called upon to act. He has the nature of the poet, and he is asked to grapple with the common complexity of cause and effect, with life in its practical realisation, of which he knows nothing, not with life in its ideal essence, of which he knows so much. He has no conception of what to do, and his folly is to feign folly. Brutus used madness as a cloak to conceal the sword of his purpose, the dagger of his will, but the Hamlet madness is a mere mask for the hiding of weakness. In the making of fancies and jests he sees a chance of delay. He keeps playing with action as an artist plays with a theory. He makes himself the spy of his proper actions, and listening to his own words knows them to be but 'words, words, words.' Instead of trying to be the hero of his own history, he seeks to be the spectator of his own tragedy. He disbelieves in everything, including himself, and yet his doubt helps him not, as it comes not from scepticism but from a divided will.|$|E
