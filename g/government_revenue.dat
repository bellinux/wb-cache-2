5|$|In 168 BC, {{the land}} tax rate was reduced from one-fifteenth of a farming household's crop yield to one-thirtieth, {{and later to}} a one-hundredth of a crop yield for the last decades of the dynasty.

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the war, the majority of finance for the Southern government came via duties on international trade. The import tariff, enacted in May 1861, was set at 12.5% and it roughly matched in coverage the previously existing Federal tariff, the Tariff of 1857. Between February 17 and May 1 of 1861, 65% of all <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> was raised from the import tariff. However, revenue from the tariffs all but disappeared after the Union imposed its blockade of Southern coasts. By November 1861 the proportion of <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> coming from custom duties had dropped to one-half of one percent. Secretary of Treasure Memminger had expected that the tariff would bring in about 25 million dollars in revenue in the first year alone. In fact, the total revenue raised in this way during the entire war was only about $3.4 million.|$|E
40|$|The {{supply of}} {{external}} financing {{to developing countries}} generally tends to increase in periods when export earnings are booming and thus, in periods of increasing <b>government</b> <b>revenues.</b> Conversely, Stabex and IMF Compensatory Financing transfers are primarily designed {{to take place in}} response to a fall in export earnings, and thus, in periods when <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> are decreasing. However, these transfers occur in an unsteady way with respect to the cycle of <b>government</b> <b>revenues.</b> When occurring in periods of decreasing <b>government</b> <b>revenues,</b> only Stabex transfers are used to finance additional primary expenditures (i. e. expenditures other than interest on public debt). This effect contrasts with the effects usually reported for other instruments of external financing. In periods of increasing <b>government</b> <b>revenues,</b> Stabex and Compensatory Financing transfers have no impact on fiscal deficit. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
25|$|From the 1950s to the 1980s, {{the central}} <b>government's</b> <b>revenues</b> derived chiefly from {{the profits of}} the state enterprises, which were remitted to the state.

40|$|Unlike {{previous}} research on the causal relationship between <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> and expenditures in the United Kingdom, this study estimates an asymmetric error correction model within a momentum threshold autoregressive framework over the period 1955 - 2009. The results indicate that <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> respond to short-run changes in government expenditures as well as asymmetrically to budgetary disequilibrium. With respect to the asymmetric adjustment, the response of <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> to a worsening budget is faster (in absolute terms) than to an improving budget. Thus, contrary to previous studies on the UK, the empirical findings lend support for the spend-tax hypothesis. Revenues Expenditures Budget deficits Asymmetries...|$|R
5|$|These {{measures}} were introduced {{due to the}} collapse of the army during the Soviet intervention. Before the invasion the army could field 100,000 troops, after the invasion only 25,000. Desertions were pandemic, and the recruitment campaigns for young people often drove them to the opposition. To better organize the military, seven military zones were established, each with its own Defence Council. The Defence Councils were established at the national, provincial and district level to empower the local PDPA. It is estimated that the Afghan government spent as much as 40 percent of <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> on defense.|$|E
5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate {{government}} {{also tried to}} raise revenue through unorthodox means. Early on (in {{the first half of}} 1861), when the support for the separation from the Union and the military effort was running strong, the donation of coins and gold to the government accounted for about 35% of all sources of government funds. This source, however, dried up over time as individuals and institutions in the South both ran down their personal holdings of bullion and became more unwilling to make donations as war-weariness set in. As a consequence, by the summer of 1862, the share of <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> coming from these donations fell to less than 1%. Over the course of the entire war this source of revenue contributed only 0.2% of total wartime expenditure.|$|E

40|$|The public {{managers}} worries {{to increase}} the local <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> are almost always related with changes in the tax rates, affecting all the agents in the economy. However, {{at the same time}} tax exeptions are used like policy instrument in order to achieve economic growth in some sectors, increasing the pressure over some other sectors. This document analize the effect of the tax rates changes over the local <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> by the estimation of elasticities. This relation is known as the Laffer Courve. The main results show an inelastic relation between the tax rate and the revenues, wich means that an increase of 1 % in the tax rate generate an increase in local <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> in less than a 1 %. The results of the model sugesst that a local policy oriented to raise the local <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> increasing the tax rate is not effective. ...|$|R

5|$|The grain {{trade was}} a {{profitable}} private enterprise {{during the early}} Western Han, yet Emperor Wu's government intervened in the grain trade when it established the equable marketing system (also known as the ever-normal granary system) in 110 BC. The government purchased grain when it was plentiful and inexpensive, shipping it to granaries for storage or to areas where grain was scarce. The system was intended to eliminate grain speculation, to create a standard price and to increase <b>government</b> <b>revenue.</b> The system was designed by civil servant Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BC)—who was previously a merchant. Sang Hongyang was criticized by merchants for placing government officials in market stalls. This supply system was discontinued in Eastern Han, although it was briefly revived by Emperor Ming of Han (r. 57–75). Emperor Ming also abolished the system in 68 AD, when {{he believed that the}} government's storage of grain increased prices and made wealthy landowners richer.|$|E
5|$|Salt mining: Ancient China {{was among}} the {{earliest}} civilizations {{in the world with}} cultivation and trade of salt mining. They first discovered natural gas when they excavated rock salt as the Chinese writer, poet, and politician Zhang Hua of the Jin Dynasty wrote in his book Bowuzhi how people in Zigong, Sichuan excavated natural gas and used it to boil a rock salt solution. The ancient Chinese gradually mastered and advanced the techniques of producing salt. Salt mining was an arduous task for the ancient Chinese, where they faced geographical and technological constraints. Salt was mainly extracted from the sea and salt works in the coastal areas in late imperial China equated to more than 80 percent of national production. In conjunction to this, the Chinese made use of natural crystallization of salt lakes and constructed some artificial evaporation basins close to the shores. In 1041, during the medieval Song dynasty, the Chinese drilled a well with a diameter {{about the size of a}} bowl and several dozen feet deep was drilled for salt production. In Southwestern China, natural salt deposits were mined with bores that could reach to a depth of more than 1000 meters but the yields of ground and salt were relatively low. As salt was a necessity of life for human civilization, salt mining played a pivotal role as one of the most important sources of Imperial Chinese <b>government</b> <b>revenue</b> and state development.|$|E

40|$|Local {{governments in}} many parts of the country {{continue}} to struggle with slowing <b>revenues.</b> Local <b>governments</b> rely heavily on property taxes and transfers from state <b>governments,</b> and <b>revenues</b> from both of these sources may remain weak over the next few years. As new property tax assessments begin to reflect the decline in house prices over the past few years, local property tax revenues may fall in many areas unless tax rates are increased. In addition, decreases in state revenues over the past few years have led to a slowdown in state transfers to local governments. This article finds that for this downturn, local <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> from property taxes and state transfers combined were likely slowest in fiscal year 2011. However, weakness in local <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> may continue for several years, especially if home prices decline further.

In 2010, the so-called “step-up in basis ” provisions will be repealed (with some accommodations to protect small estates). A permanent elimination of the estate tax would naturally lead to a decrease in <b>government</b> <b>revenues</b> from that particular tax.
