5|$|Within {{the scope}} of a popular {{comparison}} that draws parallels between House and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, Wilson is equivalent to Doctor Watson. In two-parts episodes such as Euphoria, Part 1 and Euphoria, Part 2, and House's Head and Wilson's Heart, Wilson's voice is heard narrating the story, while Dr. Watson is the character who narrates the stories in most of Sherlock Holmes novels. Leonard has said that his character and House were originally intended to play roles similar to Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes, respectively, in the series although he believes that House's team has {{assumed the role of}} Watson since the show has begun. Producer Katie Jacobs believes that Wilson and House both hide from mature relationships, which brings the two closer together. She has said that {{the difference between the two}} characters is that Wilson finds it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no because he wants to please the other person. The similarities between Dr. Wilson and Dr. Watson was also one of the reasons that made Leonard choose House over Numb3rs.|$|E
5|$|Like so much else, this is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but {{the balance}} of historians' judgements is that there {{may well have been}} bishops based in Llanbadarn for a period, or even periods, in Celtic times. Church {{organisation}} in early medieval (pre-1100) Wales was flexible, and there were no fixed dioceses. The claim in Padarn's Life that he was bishop of Ceredigion reflects a tradition, but the actual area of the saint's influence was in north Ceredigion and what is now Radnorshire (mid-Powys). Ceredigion south of the river Wyre was David country. Some time after this the church is said to have lost its episcopal privileges. The church is thought to have been annexed, after the dissolution of the see, to that of St David's; although as with much of the early history this is uncertain. Bishops at this time were, in Wales, rather more itinerant than they later became, and diocesan boundaries much more fluid than they were later. Gerald of Wales (Gerald de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis), reported that he had been told that the bishopric had been lost because at some time past Llanbadarn's bishop had been murdered and the church lands appropriated by his killers, the forerunners of the clas which held the church {{at the time of his}} visit in 1188.|$|E

25|$|In response, many {{communities}} began passing ordinances that either restricted or prohibited their sale outright. The head shops and other sellers of paraphernalia challenged them in court.

Regulators, indeed, seem to be on a hiding to nothing - they are routinely savaged in the press, they are seldom informed that they have got it right and hardly ever told what a balanced or successful regime of regulation would like.

25|$|Dolphins {{are often}} {{regarded}} as one of Earth's most intelligent animals, though it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> just how intelligent. Comparing species' relative intelligence is complicated by differences in sensory apparatus, response modes, and nature of cognition. Furthermore, the difficulty and expense of experimental work with large aquatic animals has so far prevented some tests and limited sample size and rigor in others. Compared to many other species, however, dolphin behavior has been studied extensively, both in captivity and in the wild. See cetacean intelligence for more details.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} indigenous {{influence on}} the Jindyworobaks was literature which had been taken down by white folklorists and anthropologists. Written, as opposed to transcribed, indigenous literature did not appear in print until the 1920s when David Unaipon, a Christian from Point McLeay mission, South Australia, published {{a large body of}} work. Unaipon was publishing into the 1950s, by which time the Jindyworobaks were in decline. Unaipon was the sole published Indigenous Australian writer during their heyday, and indeed {{it was not until the}} 1960s that a second was published - Oodgeroo Noonuccal (Kath Walker). Unaipon, despite coming from South Australia, is not mentioned in the works of the Jindyworobaks, so it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> how much of an influence, Legendary Tales of the Australian Aborigines was.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{necropolis}} of Sekhemkhet {{was never}} finished, it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> which planned cultic building had already existed. The pyramid courtyard {{was surrounded by}} a niched enclosure wall facing north-west. It was 1.850ft long, 607ft wide and 33ft high. The only archaeologically preserved cultic building is the Southern Tomb, its base measurement is estimated to be 105ft x 52ft. The subterranean structure included a tight corridor, beginning at the western site of the tomb and ending in a double chamber. In this chamber in 1963 Jean-Philippe Lauer excavated the burial of a 2-years-old toddler. The identity of this child remains a mystery, the only for sure known fact about it is that it cannot be king Sekhemkhet himself, since the king was always depicted as a young man.|$|E

And this will fit in here: “Our consciences are not of the same pattern, an inner deliverance of fixed laws—they are the voice of sensibilities as various as our memories;” and this: “Every strong feeling makes to itself a conscience of its own—has its own piety.” ...|$|R

25|$|I {{find it very}} <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this truth. I am {{to blame}} for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part {{of the responsibility for}} this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E
