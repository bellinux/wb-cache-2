40|$|Abstract: Problem of {{defining}} convexity of a digital region is considered. Definition of DL − (digital line) convexity is proposed, {{and it is}} shown to be stronger {{than the other two}} definitions, T −(triangle) convexity and L−(line) convexity. In attempt to connect the convexity of digital sets, to the fact that digital set can be a fuzzy set, the notion of convexity of the membership function is introduced. Digital set is placed in (x, y) -plane, and values of the membership function for every centroid of that set is drifted on z-axis, so our consideration is fully and clearly represented in R 3. For convexity in (x, y) -plane we chose the DL−convexity (digital line convexity) as the most appropriate for our purpose. For membership function the quasi convexity is chosen. All these notions are introduced, {{in order to be able}} to define the <b>digital</b> convex <b>fuzzy</b> hull of a <b>digital</b> <b>fuzzy</b> set.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new circuit to {{implement}} a Mamdani-type interval type- 2 neural <b>fuzzy</b> <b>chip</b> with on-chip incremental learning ability (IT 2 NFC-OL) for applications in changing environments. Traditional interval type- 2 fuzzy systems use an iterative procedure to find the system outputs, which is computationally expensive, especially for hardware implementation. To address this problem, the IT 2 NFC-OL uses a simplified type reduction operation to reduce the hardware implementation cost without degrading the learning performance. The software-implemented IT 2 NFC-OL is characterized by online structure learning and parameter learning using a gradient descent algorithm. The learned fuzzy model is then implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. The FPGA-implemented IT 2 NFC-OL performs not only fuzzy inference but also online consequent parameter learning for applications in changing environments. Novel circuits for the computation of system outputs and the update of interval consequent values are proposed. The learning performance of the software-implemented IT 2 NFC-OL and the on-chip learning ability are verified with applications to time-varying data sequence prediction and system control problems and by comparisons with different software-implemented type- 1 and type- 2 neural fuzzy systems and interval type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>chips...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the architecture of}} two VLSI <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>chips</b> designed to run at very high speed: 50 Mega Fuzzy Inference per Second (MFIPS) at least. The two projects differ {{in the number of}} inputs; one processes 2 - 4 seven bit inputs while the other one 8 - 16 seven bit inputs. The two chips have been designed for applications in High Energy Physics Experiments (HEPE) where the apparatus, called trigger device, needs to discriminate different nuclear events in few microseconds. So far most of the fuzzy logic applica-tions do not require high speed because not required by the industrial applications, therefore they have been done by implementing the fuzzy system on microprocessors, DSPs, or on commercial <b>fuzzy</b> <b>chips</b> which do not have very high speed performances like those necessary for HEPE. In the first phase of our research 1. 0 ym VLSI <b>fuzzy</b> <b>chip</b> [11, [2] prototype with four 7 bit inputs and one output running at 50 MFIPS was designed and constructed whose processing rate depends upon the number of rules of the fuzzy system. To further increase the speed we have faced the problem of processing, when possible, only the active fuzzy rules which are a few percent of the total ones. The research carried out on this prototype allowed us to extract some general conclu-sions:- for applications with no more than 4 inputs only the active rules are processed. Our design has a processing rate of 320 ns for 4 inputs, whichever is the fuzzy system. The process-ing rate is higher if less than 4 inputs are processed and reaches 100 ns for two inputs. - for applications which need 8 - 16 inputs an Active Rule Selector (ARS) has been designed to increase the process-ing speed which is 20 ns times the number of processed rules. The ARS is able to reject most of the non active rules.
