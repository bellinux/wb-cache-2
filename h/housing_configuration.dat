5000|$|It {{was perhaps}} Cautley’s {{interest}} in these neighborhood spaces, combined with this strong interest in local species, which caused the architects/planners Clarence Stein and Henry Wright to {{take an interest in}} her. Stein and Wright had already been experimenting with innovative housing design, and when Cautley joined their office in 1924, they began working on a now well-known housing project in the Sunnyside neighborhood of Queens in New York City, not far from the Brooklyn neighborhood where Cautley had spent much of her childhood. Sunnyside Gardens was built in response to the post-World War I housing shortage, and was intended for families of modest income. The great achievement of Sunnyside was its 200 ft. by 900 ft. “super-blocks,” with all the houses oriented towards rear courts. Only 28 percent of each block was developed, allowing for a large middle expanse to be devoted to community garden plots and public greensward. Some believe that Cautley should be largely credited for devising this <b>housing</b> <b>configuration,</b> although she is often only mentioned in passing in articles on the work of Stein and Wright. Cautley’s planting plans filled the rear court of each house with sycamores and flowering shrubs, enclosed by low hedgerows that delineated each parcel while still fostering a communal sensibility among neighbors.|$|E
40|$|When using {{perspective}} cameras underwater, {{the underwater}} housing with its glass interface between water and air causes the light rays {{to change their}} direction due to refraction. In applications where geometrical properties of images are exploited without explicitly modeling refraction, i. e. when using the perspective pinhole camera model, {{this leads to a}} systematical error. This error is depending on the <b>housing</b> <b>configuration</b> like distance between camera and glass interface and angle between glass interface normal and optical axis. In this paper, we analyze the calibration of those parameters using a camera model explicitly considering refraction. The goal is to determine those parameters without the need of handling a calibration target underwater, which is cumbersome, if not impossible. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the methodologies, a {{software}} and results developed in the European FUME program to map the rural-urban interfaces (RUI). Three methodologies were set up for RUI mapping: two on the local scale (the community scale) and one on the global scale (the European scale). The first local scale method was developed in a French context by IRSTEA. In this case the RUI is defined by a radius of 100 metres around each house located at a distance inferior to 200 metres from forests or scrublands. The building density was used to create four classes of <b>housing</b> <b>configuration.</b> Then the structure of vegetation was characterized and mapped to emphasize its horizontal continuity with landscape ecology metrics. The RUI map was created by a combination of <b>housing</b> <b>configuration</b> and vegetation characterisation. The second local scale method developed by TRAGSATEC is based on three phases. First a settlement map creation with the union of a land use cover and a vegetation cover defines the housing and the landscape that surrounds them. Then a buffer is created around settlements which are located at a distance inferior to 400 m from the forest; its size depends on the difficulty in protecting the houses against fire. In the final phase the different types of RUI are defined from the type of settlement and vegetation-settlement connection around houses. The global scale method developed by IRSTEA makes possible the comparison of the situations and the importance of RUI in the different European countries. On the global scale, the rural urban interfaces are defined by a radius of 400 metres around houses located atless than 200 metres from forests or shrubland. The global rural urban interface map results from the combination of criteria from the Corine Land Cover database and from the soil sealing database. A major step of the work was the development of a software named RUImap with the three different methods above. The use of the tool could be very advantageous for fire risk analysis on RUI scale, and for local quantification of fuel charge and continuity. This information linked with the direct knowledge of the general context is very important for the local fire risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|The {{severity}} of gear noise response {{depends on the}} sensitivity of geared rotor system dynamics to the transmission error. As gearbox design trending towards lighter weight and lower noise, the influence of housing compliance on system dynamic characteristics cannot be ignored. In this study, a gear-shaft-bearing-housing coupled impedance model is proposed {{to account for the}} effect of housing compliance on the vibration of geared transmission system. This proposed dynamic model offers convenient modeling, efficient computing, and ability to combine computed parameters with experimental ones. The numerical simulations on system dynamic characteristics are performed for both a rigid <b>housing</b> <b>configuration</b> and a flexible one. Natural frequencies, dynamic mesh forces, and dynamic bearing reaction loads are computed, and the housing compliance contribution on system dynamic characteristics is analyzed. Results show that increasing housing compliance will decrease the system natural frequencies and will affect the dynamic bearing reaction loads significantly but have very little influence on the dynamic mesh force. Also, the analysis shows that bearing stiffness has significant influence on the degree of housing contribution on system dynamic characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Late twentieth-century housing, {{formed by}} {{economic}} and internally generated functional problems {{rather than by}} limitations imposed by traditional street pattern and block size, is fundamentally anti-urban. Modern American housing of the post-World War II era, like any complex social phenomenon, was influenced by multiple forces. Among the most salient are single proprietary control of large parcels of urban land and pre-World War II stylistic trends / social ideals, {{both of which were}} reinforced by revisions to zoning regulations. The traditional relationship of the individual dwelling to the block and the street (as well as the individual to the community, as represented by a parallel, formal urban organization) is altered {{as a result of a}} changed urban <b>housing</b> <b>configuration.</b> Although the urban characteristics of traditional eighteenth- and nineteenth-century housing blocks remain viable, the dwellings of which they were composed were products of an economic and social structure whose housing requirements are no longer appropriate in contemporary culture. Modem housing, not limited by normative street and block configuration fulfills some of the economic and programmatic requirements of contemporary society, but because it is inherently anti-urban its presence is ultimately destructive of civic life.

Summary statistics based on 15 short tandem repeats strongly suggest significant effects of genetic drift, including {{the loss of}} allele diversity, among the enclosures within the housing facilities even though gene flow among the different housing units is actively promoted by colony management. Management methods of selectively harvesting female macaques to prevent overrepresentation of one or only a few matrilines and cross-fostering 1 -wk-old infants among breeding cages and corn cribs have been insufficient to prevent genetic subdivisions among the cages and corn cribs and to evenly distribute genetic diversity throughout the colony. In addition to promoting several colony management strategies recommended herein to effectively curb inbreeding and genetic differentiation, current attempts of infant cross-fostering and minimizing matriline fragmentation should be expanded. The inclusion of inbred or highly genetically homogeneous animals with diminished allele diversity in linkage and association studies will likely compromise the potential for identifying allele–disease associations, whereas the inclusion of macaques from different geographic origins or their hybrids (or both) in experimental research confounds interpretations of phenotypic differences, due to inflation of the genetic contribution to phenotypic variance...|$|R

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that the cognitive system processes human faces faster and more precisely than other stimuli. Also, faces summon visual attention in an automatic manner, as evidenced by efficient, ‘pop-out’ search for face targets amongst homogeneous non-face distractors. Pop-out for faces implies that faces are processed as a basic visual ‘feature’ by specialized face-tuned detectors, similar to the coding of other features (e. g., color, orientation, motion, etc.). However, it is unclear whether such face detectors encode only the global face configuration or both global and local face features. If the former were correct, the face detectors should be unable to support search for a local face feature, rendering search slower relative to non-face stimuli; that is, there would be local feature suppression (LFS) for faces. If the latter was the case, there should be no difference in the processing of local and, respectively, global face features. In two experiments, participants discerned the presence (vs. absence) of a local target defined as a part of either a normal or a scrambled (schematic or realistic) face or of a non-face (Kanizsa diamond or realistic <b>house)</b> <b>configuration.</b> The results consistently showed a robust LFS effect in both reaction times and error rates for face stimuli, and either no difference or even a local feature enhancement effect for the control stimuli.

In order to do this, a multi-stage methodology is used {{to reduce the number of}} needed simulations, performed by the Dynamic Building Energy Simulation model (DBES). The studied cases consist on single-family houses in Finland and Spain. Starting from reference buildings in these countries, different envelope parameters, heat recovery units, heating/cooling systems and renewable energy sources were considered. Results reveal cost-optimal solutions with primary energy consumption close to 125 kWh/m 2 a in Finland and 122 kWh/m 2 a in Spain. In order to achieve nZEB level, i. e., to reduce that consumption to 50 kWh/m 2 a, 20 m 2 of PV-panels are needed in Spain to generate electricity. However, this value rises to 50 m 2 in Finland. Global annual costs remain similar, or lower in the case of Spain, to those of the reference buildings. It has been proved that improving the insulation of the thermal envelope beyond current regulation requirements is not cost-efficient. Low installation-cost heating systems (e. g. air-to-air heat pumps) are the base of cost-optimal solutions, under the financial parameters considered in this study.
