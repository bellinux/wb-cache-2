5|$|In his {{judgment}} of 29 January 2008, Justice Woo ordered Pacific <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> release its subscribers' information {{only to the}} six Japanese companies that were parties to the case.

Following the ruling, some downloaders who had already settled with Odex planned a countersuit to recover their settlement monies. The ruling may have set a precedent for online privacy in Singapore by {{making it more difficult}} for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloaders.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} Atlantis: The Lost Empire was {{conceived}} in October 1996 when Don Hahn, Gary Trousdale, Kirk Wise, and Tab Murphy lunched at a Mexican restaurant in Burbank, California.

While primarily utilizing the <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> research the mythology of Atlantis, the filmmakers became interested in the clairvoyant readings of Edgar Cayce and decided to incorporate some of his ideas—notably that of a mother-crystal which provides power, healing, and longevity to the Atlanteans—into the story. They also visited museums and old army installations to study the technology of the early 20th century (the film's time period), and traveled 800feet underground in New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns to view the subterranean trails which would {{serve as a model for}} the approach to Atlantis in the film.|$|E
