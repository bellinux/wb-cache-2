We analyse aspects of the relationship that the residents of the six villages located within the two reserves have with their environment, by examining both the ′environmental economic activities′ residents are involved in and their discourses on, and interpretations of, the notion of environment and the conservation precepts put forward by the biosphere reserves. Our research explores how the objectives of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization′s Man and Biosphere Programme, disseminated by biosphere reserves, are put into practice on the ground. In particular, we look at how <b>environmental</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> are experienced and practised without necessarily being accompanied by the integration, acceptance, and internalisation of conservation principles-and how these activities contribute, or fail to contribute, to the crystallisation of a new ′conservation space′...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} article. The {{purpose of}} the article is proposing methods for {{determining}} the components of vectors integral indicator of eco-economic activity of the cluster structure. The results of the analysis. The article offers the author's definition of the cluster of <b>environmental</b> and <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> Innovative cluster of ecological and <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> {{in the development of}} the region (ICEEA) is a form of interaction that connects businesses and organizations of different forms, which are oriented in their work on ecobalanced management decisions on an innovative basis for sustainable development. Advantages ICEEA is to produce competitive environmental products, to increase the export potential of the region, increasing the share of high technology and knowledge-intensive sectors of the economy, reducing demand for primary resources, the developing of green business and, as a consequence to increase the investment attractiveness of the region. For the ecological and economic evaluation of the enterprises activity within the cluster structure prompted the concept of level of <b>environmental</b> and <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> cluster. The level of <b>environmental</b> and <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> cluster refers to the degree of investment attractiveness of the region at different stages of cluster operation taking into account <b>environmental,</b> social, <b>economic</b> and <b>environmental</b> and <b>economic</b> factors. The sequence of ecological and economic evaluation of processes in the enterprises to determine the level of <b>environmental</b> and <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> takes place in 13 stages. The article describes the key aspects of innovative regional development, namely clustering. The emphasis is on the mathematical evaluation model of ecological-economic activity in cluster formation and determination of integral indicator vectors of ecological and <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> The mathematical evaluation model of ecological-economic activity of cluster consists of four vectors: social, <b>economic,</b> <b>environmental,</b> and ecological and economic. Conclusions and directions of further researches. Proposed method of calculating the ecological and <b>economic</b> cluster merger <b>activity</b> takes into account all areas covered by the effect of enterprises clustering that enables you to accurately determine the effect of the enterprises' entry to cluster structure.

The inverted-U shaped relationship between <b>environmental</b> tax and <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> is due to a positive effect arising from the competition for resources between the final output sector and the health-enhancing activities.

Although energy-related and environmental concerns are originally local (e.g., environmental problems associated with extraction, transport, conversion and consumption of energy resources), they have recently been extended to issues at multiple spatial scales, such as global effects of large-scale energy activities, international energy trade and pollutant-emission conflicts, and regional energy allocation and environmental management (Huang and Chang, [2003]; Yuksel, [2012]). Moreover, these issues are being further complicated by rising energy prices, shrinking energy reserves, and varying legislational, geographic, socio-economic and political conditions, leading {{to a variety of}} complexities in the relevant decision-making processes (Matsuhashi et al., [1996]; Verderame et al., [2010]).

40|$|Until recently, the {{interaction}} between <b>environmental</b> quality, <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> and growth is predominantly considered in an a-spatial context. Traditional neoclassical growth theory following Solow/Swan has mainly addressed questions about environmental and resource limits to growth. Recently, much attention is also devoted to the environment-growth interface from an endogenous growth perspective. However, an important element that is missing in both the neoclassical and endogenous growth approaches is a multiregional perspective. The present theoretical study tries to present {{one of the first}} attempts to fill this gap. The analysis is based on a model of two interactive regions, with possible interaction between the regional environments via the global environment. The implications of this type of analysis are manifold. One is that endogeneity of growth is not only due to technology and knowledge formation but also to the effects of trade, resource scarcity and environmental degradation. Another implication is that a coordinated environmental policy of regions should address long-term sustainability, and take account of the positive technological and negative environmental dynamic externalities. ...|$|R
