40|$|Recently, several {{measurements}} {{have indicated}} {{the presence of}} biologically active organic micropollutants or trace components in different types of <b>waters,</b> including <b>spa</b> and medicinal <b>waters.</b> The wide spectrum and abundance of organic components of <b>spa</b> <b>waters</b> in the Carpathian basin and other European regions has been demonstrated by gas-chromatographic analyses. These components may have main role in the therapeutic and preventive mechanisms. Considering the new analytical data, traditional European classification of <b>spa</b> <b>waters</b> based on {{the quality and quantity}} of inorganic ions (salts) should be reevaluated. The association of inorganic components and the therapeutic effects is also necessary to reconsider...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{treatment}} of different skin conditions with <b>spa</b> <b>waters</b> {{is a long}} tradition dating back to at least late Hellenism. Interestingly, independent scientific examinations studying the effect of <b>spa</b> <b>waters</b> are scarce. Objective: In the present in vitro study, we compared the effect of culture media supplemented with (a) thermal <b>spa</b> <b>waters</b> (La Roche-Posay, Avène) and (b) two natural mineral drinking waters (Heppinger, Adelholzener) on physiological parameters in HaCaT keratinocytes. Methods: The different medium preparations were investigated with regard to cell proliferation and cell damage. Moreover, the impact on inflammation parameters with and without ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation was examined. Results: Two popular thermal spring waters were found to suppress cell proliferation and cell damage. Moreover, these waters reversed the induction of interleukin- 6, as measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and promoter transactivation, {{and the formation of}} reactive oxygen species after UVB stimulation. Of note, the two natural mineral waters, which are distributed as drinking waters, had some effect on the above-mentioned parameters but to a lesser extent. Conclusion: In summary, our results show that <b>spa</b> <b>waters,</b> and particularly those derived from thermal springs, reduce parameters associated with inflammation. It seems likely that trace elements such as selenium and zinc are critical for the observed effects...|$|R

50|$|In the 17th century, <b>spa</b> <b>waters</b> were {{discovered}} by Thomasin Farrer, {{the wife of}} one of Scarborough's leading citizens, John Farrer.

The waters, which stained the rocks a russet colour, tasted slightly bitter and were said to cure minor ailments. She told her friends and neighbours about the medicinal effects and drinking the <b>spa</b> <b>waters</b> became an accepted medicine.
