5000|$|Firstly, Benacerraf {{argued that}} Platonic {{approaches}} do not pass the ontological test. [...] He developed an {{argument against the}} ontology of set-theoretic Platonism, which is now historically referred to as Benacerraf's identification problem. Benacerraf noted that there are elementarily equivalent, set-theoretic ways of relating natural numbers to pure sets. However, if someone asks for the [...] "true" [...] identity statements for relating natural numbers to pure sets, then different set-theoretic methods yield contradictory identity statements when these elementarily <b>equivalent</b> <b>sets</b> are related together. [...] This generates a set-theoretic falsehood. Consequently, Benacerraf inferred that this set-theoretic falsehood demonstrates {{it is impossible for}} there to be any Platonic method of reducing numbers to sets that reveals any abstract objects.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, English {{engineer}} Freddie Williams {{began work}} on the Mark III system at the Telecommunications Research Establishment, which was to become the standard for the Western Allies {{for most of the}} war. Mark III transponders were designed to respond to specific 'interrogators', rather than replying directly to received radar signals. These interrogators worked on a limited selection of frequencies, no matter what radar they were paired with. The system also allowed limited communication to be made, including the ability to transmit a coded 'Mayday' response. The IFF sets were designed and built by Ferranti in Manchester to Williams' specifications. <b>Equivalent</b> <b>sets</b> were manufactured in the US, initially as copies of British sets, so that allied aircraft would be identified upon interrogation by each other's radar.|$|E

40|$|We propose two new {{portfolio}} optimization approaches. The {{first is}} a two-stage portfolio optimization approach using both mean-variance and mean-VaR approaches in a priority order. The second is a general mean-variance-VaR approach using both variance and VaR as a doublerisk measure simultaneously. Our approaches overcome the shortcomings of both mean-variance and mean-VaR approaches while providing additional strengths and flexibility. Comparing the mean-variance method with the mean-VaR method, we derivetwo general results: (1) the mean-variance efficient set is not a subset of mean-VaR efficient set, and vice versa# (2) the mean-variance <b>equivalent</b> <b>set</b> is not a mean-VaR <b>equivalent</b> <b>set,</b> and vice versa.

5000|$|In {{set theory}} the {{traditional}} concept of complementation may be distinguished as literal pitch class complement, [...] "where the relation obtains between specific pitch-class sets", while, {{due to the}} definition of <b>equivalent</b> <b>sets,</b> the concept may be broadened to include [...] "not only the literal pc complement of that set but also any transposed or inverted-and-transposed form of the literal complement," [...] which may be described as abstract complement, [...] "where the relation obtains between set classes". This is because since P is equivalent to M, and M is the complement of M, P is also the complement of M, [...] "from a logical and musical point of view," [...] even though not its literal pc complement. Originator Allen Forte describes this as, [...] "significant extension of the complement relation," [...] though George Perle describes this as, [...] "an egregious understatement".|$|E
50|$|Similarly for all {{practical}} purposes, 13C signal splitting due to coupling with nearby natural isotopic abundance carbons is negligible in 13C NMR spectra. However, practically all hydrogen bonded to carbon atoms is 1H in natural isotopic abundance samples, including any 13C nuclei bonded to H atoms. In a 13C spectrum with no decoupling at all, each of the 13C signals is split according to how many H atoms that C atom is next to. In order to simplify the spectrum, 13C NMR spectroscopy is most often run fully proton decoupled, meaning 1H nuclei in the sample are broadly irradiated to fully decouple them from the 13C nuclei being analyzed. This full proton decoupling eliminates all coupling with H atoms and thus splitting due to H atoms in natural isotopic abundance compounds. Since coupling between other carbons in natural isotopic abundance samples is negligible, signals in fully proton decoupled 13C spectra in hydrocarbons and most signals from other organic compounds are single peaks. This way, the number of <b>equivalent</b> <b>sets</b> of carbon atoms in a chemical structure can be counted by counting singlet peaks, which in 13C spectra {{tend to be very}} narrow (thin). Other information about the carbon atoms can usually be determined from the chemical shift, such as whether the atom is part of a carbonyl group or an aromatic ring, etc. Such full proton decoupling can also help increase the intensity of 13C signals.|$|E
