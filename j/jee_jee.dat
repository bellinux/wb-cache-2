50|$|For the {{undergraduate}} courses the admission {{is through the}} national level engineering entrance examination — <b>JEE</b> Main. (Before <b>JEE</b> Main, admission was through AIEEE.) The admission for NRI and foreign students is through the DASA scheme (Direct Admission for Students Abroad).|$|R
50|$|<b>JEE</b> Mains, unlike <b>JEE</b> Advanced, has a fixed exam {{structure}} {{and is not}} subject to change every year. Paper-1 is of three hours duration and consists of thirty multiple-choice (single-correct) questions {{in each of the three}} subjects (physics, chemistry and maths). There is negative marking for incorrect answers. 4 marks are awarded for correct answers and 1 mark is deducted for incorrect answers.|$|R

5000|$|... (2) Leung Jee- Nicknamed Dou Pei <b>Jee</b> (small poxed <b>Jee)</b> taught some {{students}} in Vietnam at the Kwangtung Wui Goon or Association of the Cantonese. Modern research suggests {{this is a}} mixing of oral accounts, as Yuen Kay Shan's elder brother, Yuen Chai Wan, was pocked-faced and traveled to Vietnam in 1936, to teach Wing Chun Kuen to immigrants from Canton. He doesn't show up in any other accounts as a son of Leung Jan's other than Fung Chun's account to Leung Ting.|$|R
40|$|We {{interpret}} the recent gravitational lensing observations of <b>Jee</b> et al. <b>Jee</b> as first {{evidence for a}} caustic ring of dark matter in a galaxy cluster. A caustic ring unavoidably forms when a cold collisionless flow falls with net overall rotation {{in and out of}} a gravitational potential well. Evidence for caustic rings of dark matter was previously found in the Milky Way and other isolated spiral galaxies. We argue that galaxy clusters have at least one and possibly two or three caustic rings. We calculate the column density profile of a caustic ring in a cluster and show that it is consistent with the observations of <b>Jee</b> et al. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures.

25|$|Admission to {{undergraduate}} programmes in all IITs {{was tied}} to the Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination (IIT-JEE). Candidates who qualify for admission through IIT-JEE used to apply for admission in four-year BTech (Bachelor of Technology), five-year BArch degree, five-year Dual Degree (Integrated Bachelor of Technology and Master of Technology) and five-year integrated MSc (Master of Sciences) courses at IIT Kharagpur. Starting from 2013, admission was done {{on the basis of}} two exams; <b>JEE</b> Mains and <b>JEE</b> Advance. Students who qualified for <b>JEE</b> Mains got the opportunity to appear for <b>JEE</b> Advance and scores of this exams are considered for the admission into IITs. The admissions to postgraduate programmes (MTech) are made primarily through the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE). Other postgraduate entrance exams include Joint Admission to MSc (JAM) for MSc, and Common Admission Test (CAT) conducted by IIMs for management studies.|$|R
30|$|Being a runtime {{infrastructure}} between {{operating systems}} and <b>JEE</b> applications, today’s <b>JEE</b> servers increase their autonomic management capabilities by implementing {{more and more}} adaptive computations [1 – 4]. According to the autonomic computing white paper [2], the term “adaptive computation” (AC) is used to denote any computing activity that implements either the complete autonomic control loop, or just one or more functions in the loop, i.e., monitor, analyze, plan, or execute. A JEE server could have tens or hundreds of adaptive computations {{because a lot of}} software/hardware objects need to be managed automatically by the server [4]. For example, PkuAS [9] has been equipped with tens adaptive computations, such as automatically adjusting its thread-pool to guarantee the predefined tradeoff between the throughputs and response times [10], recovering from the correlated faults occurred in its internal services [11], changing the execution flow of a hosted application for trading off the performance and security [12].|$|R

50|$|PSR {{conducted}} Catalyst, {{a one-day}} workshop on MS Office {{for the students}} of Boiler Plant Girls Higher Secondary School in BHEL township. The workshop was held on November 1, 2014. As a year-round project, PSR in association with LEAP (the environment club of the college) and the Entrepreneurship cell launched PET Project, an initiative to reduce the wastage of paper in campus. This was launched after considering the enormous wastage of paper that occurs in the campus. A collection box {{was placed in the}} Octagon (the computer centre) to collect the roll number sheets that are generated for each student with a print command. The sheets were then used for activities such as making note books and helping Self Help Groups by teaching them to make paper products. The event ‘Dhisai’ aimed at educating the school students of Tamil Nadu about the Joint Entrance Examinations (<b>JEE).</b> A mock <b>JEE</b> exam was conducted in Trichy for the students of class 12.Talks on Career Counselling and Cybercrime were conducted by professionals.|$|R
