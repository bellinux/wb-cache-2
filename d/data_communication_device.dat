40|$|Abstract — Software Defined Radio (SDR) capitalizes {{advances}} in signal processing and radio technology and {{is capable of}} reconfiguring RF and switching to desired frequency bands. It is a frequency-agile <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> <b>device</b> that is vastly more powerful than recently proposed multi-channel multi-radio (MC-MR) technology. In this paper, we investigate the important problem of multi-hop networking with SDR nodes. For such network, each node has a pool of frequency bands (not necessarily of equal size) {{that can be used}} for communication. The uneven size of bands in the radio spectrum prompts the need of further division into sub-bands for optimal spectrum sharing. We characterize behaviors and constraints for such multi-hop SDR network from multiple layers, including modeling of spectrum sharing and sub-band division, scheduling and interference constraints, and flow routing. We give a formal mathematical formulation with the objective of minimizing the required network-wide radio spectrum resource for a set of user sessions. Since such problem formulation falls into mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP), which is NP-hard in general, we develop a lower bound for the objective by relaxing the integer variables and linearization. Subsequently, we develop a near-optimal algorithm to this MINLP problem. This algorithm is based on a novel sequential fixing procedure, where the integer variables are determined iteratively via a sequence of linear programming. Simulation results show that solutions obtained by this algorithm are very close to lower bounds obtained via relaxation, thus suggesting that the solution produced by the algorithm is near-optimal.

Mobile IP (Internet Protocol) allows a mobile node to send and receive packets with its home IP address, regardless of the IP address of its current point of attachment in the Internet. Since Mobile IP induces the handover latency due to mobility management operations, fast handover algorithms have been studied to reduce the latency. Normal and fast handover procedures for Wireless LAN are introduced and compared each other. We propose an overall procedure that manages the layer 2 (L 2 : link layer) and layer 3 (L 3 : network layer) handovers simultaneously. Two types of the L 2 triggers in Wireless LAN system are introduced: pre-handover-trigger and link-state-trigger.

40|$|Widespread {{popularity}} of wireless <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> <b>devices,</b> {{coupled with the}} availability of higher bandwidths, {{has led to an}} increased user demand for content-rich media such as images and videos. Since such content often tends to be either private, sensitive, or paid for, there exists a requirement for securing such communication. However, solutions that rely only on traditional compute-intensive security mechanisms are unsuitable for resourceconstrained wireless devices. In this paper, we propose a selective partial image encryption scheme, which enables a trade-off between the effectiveness of the encryption method and the cost of using the method. The encryption scheme is invoked during the image compression process, with the encryption being performed between the quantizer and the entropy coder stages. Three data selection schemes have been used as part of the partial encryption scheme: subband selection, data bit selection, and random selection of pixel data. The experimental results for over 500 test images reveals that the fraction of data to be encrypted with our scheme is between 1 / 4, 096 and 1 / 256 and the PSNRs are between about 9. 5 dB to 7. 5 dB. Since the encryption cost is very low and the effectiveness is good, the proposed scheme can potentially be used to provide secure communications in a variety of wired/wireless scenarios. I...|$|R

With this understanding, a model of multiple query execution {{in the form of a}} linear integer program is offered. Several requests are issued to the distributed database management system, each specifying the collation of information comprised of a number of logically distinct data sets, or relations, and dispersed across the sites of a distributed system. Performing these tasks demands the usage of limited resources, so that efficient management commands the smallest additional imposition possible. Both processors and the <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> <b>devices</b> that interconnect them are exploited; an optimal strategy is defined to be one that minimizes a weighted sum of the costs of computation and those of information exchange incurred in resolving the group of queries. Previous models of join query evaluation would regard each individual query in isolation, to produce a sequence of independent execution strategies, one correspondingly for every request. By instead permitting multiple utilization of intermediate computations, any overlap between these queries can be exploited to further reduce the total demand placed on the system as a whole. Through investigations into the character of a number of interacting join computations, performed at a single site in isolation, an earlier single query model [1] can be extended to facilitate the cooperative execution of an entire group...|$|R
