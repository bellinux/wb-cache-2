5|$|Dusk was at 19:00 and the Turkish attack had now reached Malone's <b>Gulley</b> and The Nek. The New Zealanders {{waited until}} the Turks came close, then opened fire in the darkness, {{stopping}} their advance. Seriously outnumbered, they asked for reinforcements. Instead, the supporting troops to their rear were withdrawn and the Turks managed to get behind them. So, taking the machine-guns with them, they withdrew off Russell's Top into Rest Gully. This left the defenders at Walker's Ridge isolated {{from the rest of}} the force.|$|E
5|$|The {{interchange}} with I-275 {{is built}} over the western crossing of Willow Creek, {{a tributary of the}} River Rouge; the eastern crossing is located between Hix and Newburgh roads near Central City Park. Ford Road continues east, forming a section of the Garden City boundary near Venoy Road. The trunkline crosses into Dearborn Heights at Inkster Road. It forms the boundary between Dearborn and Dearborn Heights between <b>Gulley</b> and Evergreen roads, crossing US24 (Telegraph Road) in between. East of Telegraph Road, M-153 is built to expressway standards complete with interchanges at Edward N. Hines Drive, Evergreen Road, M-39 (Southfield Freeway) and Greenfield Road. The highway crosses the River Rouge north of the Dearborn Country Club west of Evergreen Road. Ford Road ends at Wyoming Avenue. M-153 turns south along Wyoming Avenue to cross I-94 at exit210. This interchange is also the location where I-94 and US12 (Michigan Avenue) cross, marking the eastern end of M-153 at Michigan Avenue.|$|E
5|$|They then {{undertook}} a further {{two months of}} training in Egypt before an urgent request for reinforcements led to them being dispatched to Gallipoli where they landed on 12 September. Attached to the 7th Brigade, along with the 25th, 26th and 28th Battalions, they reinforced the battle-worn New Zealand and Australian Division and took up a defensive position on Cheshire Ridge. Throughout October they defended the ridge, during which time they suffered five killed and 29 wounded, before being relieved by New Zealanders in early November. After this they moved to new positions in Mule <b>Gulley</b> where they undertook further defensive operations alongside the 26th Battalion. Losses during this time amounted to two killed and eight wounded. In December, they took over from the 28th Battalion around Happy Valley, before {{the decision was made}} to evacuate the Allied forces from the peninsula. On 12 December 1915, the battalion embarked upon the Osmaliegh, bound for Lemnos Island.|$|E

5|$|At 15:15 Lalor {{left the}} defence of The Nek to a platoon that had arrived as reinforcements, and moved his company to Baby 700. There {{he joined a}} group from the 2nd Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Leslie Morshead. Lalor was killed soon afterwards. The left flank of Baby 700 was now held by sixty men, the remnants of several units, commanded by a corporal. They had survived five charges by the Turks between 07:30 and 15:00; after the last charge the Australians were ordered to withdraw through The Nek. There, a company from the Canterbury Battalion had just arrived, with their commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas Stewart. By 16:00 the New Zealand companies had formed a defence line on Russell's Top. On Baby 700, there was on the left Morsehead's and Lalor's men, {{and at the top}} of Malone's <b>Gulley</b> were the survivors of the 2nd Battalion and some men from the 3rd Brigade. On the right were the men left from the Auckland companies, and a mixed group from the 1st, 2nd, 11th and 12th Battalions. Once Stewart's men were secure, he ordered Morsehead to withdraw. During a Turkish artillery bombardment of The Nek, Stewart was killed. The artillery heralded the start of a Turkish counter-attack; columns of troops appeared over the top of Battleship Hill and on the flanks and attacked the ANZAC lines.|$|E

25|$|The {{storming}} parties {{began to}} advance, first crossing a narrow <b>gulley</b> between {{the lake and}} the pā. Kawiti and his warriors arrived at the battle and engaged with the Colonial forces in the scrub and gullies around the pā. There followed a savage and confused battle. Eventually the discipline and cohesiveness of the British troops began to prevail and the Māori were driven back inside the pā. But they {{were by no means}} beaten, far from it, as without artillery the British had no way to overcome the defences of the pā. Hulme decided to disengage and retreat back to the Bay of Islands.|$|E
500|$|In later years, {{the tunnel}} {{has been used}} by persons who needed to exit or depart the White House without public or press attention. Tricia Nixon and her husband, Edward F.

According to Bill <b>Gulley,</b> longtime head of the White House Military Office, the tunnel was used by male White House aides to sneak their girlfriends and mistresses into the building to have sexual intercourse in the Lincoln Bedroom during the presidencies of Lyndon Johnson and [...] Jimmy Carter. Lyndon Johnson also used the tunnel to avoid Vietnam War protesters when departing the White House.

Eight battalions of reinforcements were dispatched from Constantinople a day later and that afternoon, Ottoman troops counter-attacked at Helles and Anzac.

The following night, Birdwood ordered the New Zealand and Australian Division to attack from Russell's Top and Quinn's Post towards [...] The Australian 4th Infantry Brigade (Colonel John Monash), the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and Royal Marines from the Chatham Battalion took part in the attack.
