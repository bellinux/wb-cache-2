5|$|Kinky Boots adds to {{the public}} {{discourse}} of gender, and its flexibility and fluidity. The prevalence of drag culture in mainstream media has introduced a step of separation between femininity and “being female”. While the show preaches a message of acceptance, this separation of <b>impersonation</b> and identity can cause issues for the transgender community.|$|E

5|$|Another {{cause of}} revulsion against Webster was her attempt to {{impersonate}} Thomas. She {{had managed to}} perpetrate the <b>impersonation</b> for two weeks, implying that middle-class identity amounted {{to little more than}} cultivating the right demeanour and having the appropriate clothes and possessions, whether or not they had been earned. John Church, the publican whom Webster had attempted to implicate, was himself a former servant who had risen to lower middle-class status and earned a measure of prosperity and effective management of his pub. His commitment to bettering himself through hard work was in keeping with the ethic of the time. Webster, in contrast, had simply stolen her briefly-held middle-class identity.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{is upset}} after being {{identified}} {{in a magazine}} as an actor behaving normally, far from the insane persona {{he is trying to}} maintain. To re-establish his street cred, Tracy gets a dragon tattoo on his face, but is later identified as made of sharpie. At the same time, Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) is told that he is to receive a special gift from Liz Taylor (Rachel Dratch) as a response to an impression he did of the actress on TGS with Tracy Jordan. Liz Taylor sneaks into the 30 Rock studios and, upset over Josh's <b>impersonation,</b> brutally beats him with a fire extinguisher.|$|E

5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Peter Rosenthal, begins with Madonna entering a park. After meeting {{two children and}} a teenage boy, they start roaming around the park, with Madonna singing the song. These scenes are interchanged with scenes from the motion picture, which show Madonna as the movie character Nikki Fynn. As the music video progresses, Madonna is shown to be {{in search of an}} Egyptian treasure casket. After being directed to it by a version of the High Priestess tarot card displaying her cartoon <b>impersonation,</b> Madonna opens it to find a huge diamond. She looks up happily to the children. The video ends with them continuing dancing and Madonna carrying away the casket.|$|E
5|$|Adamant {{was based}} at the Nore, {{operating}} in the North Sea and blockading the Dutch fleet at the Texel with Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet. In May 1797 mutiny broke out among the ships at the Nore, following on from one at Spithead earlier in the year. Of the two-decker ships of the fleet, only the crews of Duncan's flagship , and Hotham's crew aboard Adamant remained loyal. With only two ships available to blockade the Dutch, Duncan and Hotham took their ships out to sea, remaining in sight of the Dutch coast and for several weeks implied by false signals and manoeuvres, {{that the rest of}} the fleet was just over the horizon. Convinced by the <b>impersonation</b> that the blockade was still in force, the Dutch remained in port. Duncan and Hotham were later reinforced by the Russian squadron based at Harwich, and then by ships deserting the mutiny one by one.|$|E
5|$|Director Jewison can put {{his cards}} on the table, let his camera cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a side pocket {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid also has a less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive <b>impersonation</b> of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E

5|$|On 19 June 2013, Wizkid and his {{management}} were questioned by {{men from the}} Nigeria Police Force. Duping charges were leveled against them {{by a group of}} UNILAG students. The students claimed that Wizkid agreed to perform at the UNILAG Sports Centre on 21 May 2013 for a total sum of ₦500,000. They also claimed that he didn't show up for the show and didn't return their money. After conducting a thorough investigation, Police determined that Unilag students were bamboozled by con artists pretending to be affiliates of E.M.E. In the aforementioned interview with Showtime Celebrity, Wizkid commented on the events that transpired after the accusations. He told the media that the police were investigating the case. The masterminds behind the <b>impersonation</b> were later detained by law enforcement agents in Lagos. In addition to duping Unilag students, the culprits set up fake email and social media accounts. Wizkid also elaborated on how one can go about booking him.|$|E
5|$|When hunting larger animals, tigers {{prefer to}} bite the throat and use their {{powerful}} forelimbs {{to hold onto the}} prey, often simultaneously wrestling it to the ground. The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of strangulation. By this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much. Although they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select the calves or infirm of very large species. Healthy adult prey of this type can be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger. No other extant land predator routinely takes on prey this large on their own. Whilst hunting sambars, which comprise up to 60% of their prey in India, tigers have reportedly made a passable <b>impersonation</b> of the male sambar's rutting call to attract them.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1970s, Andy Kaufman made an Elvis <b>impersonation</b> {{part of his}} act. He is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} first notable Elvis impersonators and Elvis himself said that Kaufman was his favorite impersonator. In his act, Kaufman would precede with several failed impersonations before unexpectedly launching into a skilled <b>impersonation</b> of Elvis Presley. As Kaufman gained fame, the <b>impersonation</b> was used less and less.|$|E

50|$|With Sasso {{gone from}} the cast, Frank Caliendo began playing George W. Bush. The comic also reprised his <b>impersonations</b> from past seasons, {{including}} Al Pacino, John Madden, and Robin Williams. Pederson played Dick Clark, Woody Allen, Saddam Hussein, and Entertainment Tonight anchor Mark Steines. Vogt replaced Sasso as the James Lipton impersonator and impersonated classic sitcom stars, such as Edward Asner (The Mary Tyler Moore Show), Jackie Gleason (The Honeymooners), and Charlotte Rae (Diffrent Strokes/The Facts Of Life). Like their counterparts Jimmy Fallon and Horatio Sanz on Saturday Night Live, long-time pals Barinholtz and Meyers would frequently appear in sketches together and play off each others chemistry. Separately, Barinholtz performed celebrity <b>impersonations</b> such as Joe Millionaires Evan Marriott and Nick Nolte, while Meyers offered offbeat <b>impersonations</b> of Eminem, Matthew McConaughey, Owen Wilson, and some *NSYNC members. Jill-Michelle Meleán performed <b>impersonations</b> of Drew Barrymore, but left Mad TV midway through the season.|$|R
