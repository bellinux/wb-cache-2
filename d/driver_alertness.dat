40|$|Suburbanisation {{has been}} internationally a major {{phenomenon}} in the last decades. Suburb-to-suburb routes are nowadays the most widespread road journeys; and this resulted in an increment of distances travelled, particularly on faster suburban highways. The design of highways tends to over-simplify the driving task and this can result in decreased alertness. Driving behaviour is consequently impaired and drivers are then {{more likely to be}} involved in road crashes. This is particularly dangerous on highways where the speed limit is high. While effective countermeasures to this decrement in alertness do not currently exist, the development of in-vehicle sensors opens avenues for monitoring driving behaviour in real-time. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate in real-time the level of <b>alertness</b> of the <b>driver</b> through surrogate measures that can be collected from in-vehicle sensors. Slow EEG activity is used as a reference to evaluate <b>driver's</b> <b>alertness.</b> Data are collected in a driving simulator instrumented with an eye tracking system, a heart rate monitor and an electrodermal activity device (N= 25 participants). Four different types of highways (driving scenario of 40 minutes each) are implemented through the variation of the road design (amount of curves and hills) and the roadside environment (amount of buildings and traffic). We show with Neural Networks that reduced alertness can be detected in real-time with an accuracy of 92 % using lane positioning, steering wheel movement, head rotation, blink frequency, heart rate variability and skin conductance level. Such results show that it is possible to assess <b>driver's</b> <b>alertness</b> with surrogate measures. Such methodology could be used to warn <b>drivers</b> of their <b>alertness</b> level through the development of an in-vehicle device monitoring in real-time drivers' behaviour on highways, and therefore it could result in improved road safety...|$|R
40|$|Results {{based on}} traffic {{accident}} analysis {{indicate that a}} leading cause for automobile accidents {{is due to a}} diminished vigilance {{on the part of the}} driver. Two major factors that may result in a reduction of a <b>driver's</b> <b>alertness</b> are drowsiness and intoxication. Developing effective technologies for measuring drowsiness/intoxication is therefore imperative for reducing automobile accidents. The development of technologies for monitoring driver's vigilance is a major challenge in the field of accident avoidance systems. In order to accurately and robustly characterize a driver's vigilance level, information from different sources (e. g., driver's physiological conditions and physical reactions, sensing of vehicle behavior, response of driver, weather conditions, etc.) needs to be collected and processed.

40|$|We propose an eye {{detection}} and tracking method based on color and geometrical {{features of the}} human face using a monocular camera.

We compare our method with recently proposed techniques and results show that it provides more accurate tracking and robustness to variations in view of the face. A procedure for detecting tracking errors is employed to recover the loss of feature points in case of occlusion or very fast head movement.

40|$|Abstract—Drowsiness or {{sleepiness}} {{while driving}} {{has been known}} {{as a cause of}} <b>driver</b> <b>alertness</b> decrement and has been a concern in transportation system for years. Much research has been conducted to study factors affecting alertness. Some concluded that secondary task while driving may increase alertness, whereas others informed that any other task besides driving itself might interfere with driver concentration. This study proposed an in-vehicle response test system as secondary task in driving system to maintain <b>driver</b> <b>alertness</b> status. Eight professional drivers were involved as participant in a set of laboratory experiment. They drove a set of driving scenario in a car simulator. The alertness status was monitored by four-channel electroencephalograph, whilst response tests were conducted using a tailor-made apparatus. This apparatus emits alarm signals, in random-time interval or fixed-time-interval. Subjects had to give response by pushing a button when signal occur. Statistical analyses were performed to analyze the effect of each of the two types of signals. Results of this study showed that <b>driver</b> <b>alertness</b> level could be well maintained by the two response test systems. Results also suggested that compared to fixed-time-interval response test, random-time-interval response gave better performance in maintaining alertness. If applied inside a vehicle along with a sleepiness detection system, this response test would decrease sleepiness on wheel occurrence through maintaining the <b>driver</b> <b>alertness</b> level.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effects of somatosensory 20. Hz mechanical vibration, applied to driver's right heel during prolonged, simulated, monotonous driving, on their cardiovascular hemodynamic behavior. In 12 healthy young male volunteers, during 90 -min periods of simulated monotonous driving, we compared cardiovascular variables during application of 20. Hz mechanical vibration with 1. 5. Hz as a control and with no vibration. The parameters recorded were indices of key cardiovascular hemodynamic phenomena, i. e., blood pressure as an indicator of stress, cardiac output, and total peripheral-vascular resistance. The principle results were that all conditions increased the mean blood pressure, and elicited a vascular-dominant reaction pattern typically observed in monotonous driving tasks. However, mean blood pressure and total peripheral-vascular resistance during the monotonous task were significantly decreased in those receiving the 20. Hz vibration as compared with 1. 5. Hz and with no vibration. The observed differences indicate the cardiovascular system being more relieved from monotonous driving stress with the 20. Hz vibration. The major conclusion is that applying 20.

40|$|Decline of {{alertness}} {{constitutes a}} normal physiological phenomenon {{but could be}} aggravated when drivers operate in monotonous environments, even in rested individuals. Driving performance is impaired and this increases crash risk due to inattention. This paper aims to show that road characteristics - namely road design (road geometry) and road side variability (signage and buildings) – influence subjective assessment of <b>alertness</b> by <b>drivers.</b> This study used a driving simulator to investigate the drivers’ ability to subjectively detect periods of time when their alertness is importantly reduced by varying road geometry and road environment. Driver’s EEG activity is recorded as a reference to evaluate objectively <b>driver's</b> <b>alertness</b> and is compared to self-reported alertness by participants. Twenty-five participants drove on four different scenarios (varying road design and road environment monotony) for forty minutes. It was observed that participants were significantly more accurate in their assessment before the driving task as compared to after (90 % versus 60 %). Errors in assessment were largely underestimations of their real alertness rather than over-estimations. The ability to detect low alertness as assessed with an EEG was highly dependent on the road monotony. Scenarios with low roadside variability resulted in high overestimation of the real alertness, which was not observed on monotonous road design. The findings have consequences for road safety and suggest that countermeasures to lapses of alertness cannot rely solely on self-assessment from drivers and road design should reduce environments with low variability...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper reviews {{aspects of}} traffic safety and {{behavior}} of drivers in road tunnels based on several case studies of traffic accidents along the traffic zones of tunnel alignment (entrance: zone 2; transition zone: zone 3; and inner zone: zone 4). This paper commences with engineering and design aspects that differentiate between road tunnel and open highways and, afterward, reviews certain issues related to tunnel safety and crashes such as driver behavior, highway alignment, tunnel length, and longitudinal friction. This paper additionally discusses the severity of crashes in road tunnels, specifically severe crashes in road tunnels, including fire incidents and their relationship with vehicle crashes. Finally, additional risk measures and classifications of tunnel safety are introduced. The risk of a crash in a tunnel is reduced compared with crashes on the open road (approximately half); however, tunnel crash severity is higher. The catastrophe potential related to a tunnel fire is higher than in a vehicle crash, even though fire crashes are less frequent than traffic crashes. Drivers in road tunnels generally reduce their speed and increase their lateral position from the right tunnel wall while driving. In shorter tunnels, with reduced driving speed, driver vigilance may be more robust without being hindered by dull driving, which {{is more common in}} longer tunnels. Still, in spite of <b>driver</b> <b>alertness,</b> crash rates in tunnels occur due to the tunnel's unusual driving environment. Crash rates are lower in the tunnel inner zone due to <b>driver</b> <b>alertness,</b> especially after passing the transition zone and acclimating to the tunnel environment. The number of crashes, however, is higher along zone 4 (tunnel inner zone, which is the principal zone), as it covers longer driving distance. According to most studies, short tunnels were found to exhibit higher crash rates than long tunnels because the entrance zones incorporate higher crash rates, compared with the midzones; nonetheless, longer unidirectional (freeway and multilane) tunnels with higher design speed, entail lower <b>driver</b> <b>alertness</b> and diminished concentration due to relatively monotonous driving in spite of a tunnel's closed environment...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{progress}} in developing highly automated driving applications {{and the corresponding}} opportunities for the driver to take {{himself out of the}} loop have raised a couple of questions regarding the effects of highly automated driving on the driver's state. Within this framework a simulator study was conducted at the Wuerzburg Institute for Traffic Sciences (WIVW GmbH) in collaboration with Volkswagen Group Research with 16 test drivers. The drivers took part in three sessions each requiring him/her to drive on a highway with a speed limit of 120 km/h. Drowsiness was assessed continuously during the drive by eye lid closure measurements and was classified into 4 different levels. Whenever a driver reached a certain drowsiness level during the manual drive, a test phase of 15 minutes was initiated ending with a take-over scenario. Depending on the experimental condition, the test phase was 1) driving with a highly automated system (lateral and longitudinal control was performed by the automated system allowing hands-off driving), 2) driving with the system and additionally performing a quiz task or 3) driving manually during the test phase. The results show that especially in the manual and the highly automated condition without secondary task engagement the drowsiness level clearly increased during the 15 minutes test phases. During the phases with highly automated system active and the additional quiz task, drowsiness stayed on a low level and remained constant during the test phase. This implicates that an interesting and motivating secondary task has the potential to raise <b>driver's</b> <b>alertness</b> significantly, especially during highly automated driving...|$|R
40|$|Driver {{errors and}} {{carelessness}} contribute {{most of the}} road accidents occurring nowadays. The major driver errors are caused by drowsiness, drunken and reckless behavior of the driver. This paper focuses on a driver drowsiness detection system in Intelligent Transportation System, which focuses on abnormal behavior exhibited by the driver using Raspberry pi single board computer. The capability of driving support systems to detect the level of <b>driver’s</b> <b>alertness</b> {{is very important in}} ensuring road safety. By observation of blink pattern and eye movements, driver fatigue can be detected early enough to prevent collisions caused by drowsiness. In the proposed system a non-intrusive driver drowsiness monitoring system has been developed using computer vision techniques. Based on the simulation results, {{it was found that the}} system has been able to detect drowsiness in spite of driver wearing spectacles as well as the darkness level inside the vehicle. Moreover the system is capable of detecting drowsiness within time duration of about two seconds. The detected abnormal behavior is corrected through alarms in real time. We have also done a transformation of an image from 2 d to 3 d using wavelet analysis. Here we also compared the wavelet technique with other techniques namely stereo-photogrammetric & edge information technique. The image conversion from 2 d to 3 d can be done by finding the edges of an image. This edge detection can be used in various fields of image processing, image analysis, image pattern recognition, and computer vision, as well as in human vision. In this, we did our experiment using wavelet technique and the results when compared with the stereo photogrammetry and edge information techniques we find that the wavelet technique gives better result.

40|$|The {{development}} of technologies for preventing drowsiness at the wheel is a major challenge {{in the field of}} accident avoidance systems. Preventing drowsiness during driving requires a method for accurately detecting a decline in <b>driver</b> <b>alertness</b> and a method for alerting and refreshing the driver. As a detection method, the authors have developed a system that uses image processing technology to analyse images of the road lane with a video camera integrated with steering wheel angle data collection from a car simulation system. The main contribution of this study is a novel algorithm for drowsiness detection and tracking, which is based on the incorporation of information from a road vision system and vehicle performance parameters. Refinement of the algorithm is more precisely detected the level of drowsiness by the implementation of a support vector machine classification for robust and accurate drowsiness warning system. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification technique diminished drowsiness level by using non intrusive systems, using standard equipment sensors, aim to reduce these road accidents caused by drowsiness drivers. This detection system provides a non-contact technique for judging various levels of <b>driver</b> <b>alertness</b> and facilitates early detection of a decline in alertness during driving. The presented results are based on a selection of drowsiness database, which covers almost 60 hours of driving data collection measurements.

40|$|The paper aims at {{detecting}} on-line cognitive {{failures in}} driving by decoding the EEG signals acquired during visual alertness, motor-planning and motor-execution {{phases of the}} <b>driver.</b> Visual <b>alertness</b> of the <b>driver</b> is detected by classifying the pre-processed EEG signals obtained from his pre-frontal and frontal lobes into two classes: alert and non-alert. Motor-planning performed by the driver using the pre-processed parietal signals is classified into four classes: braking, acceleration, steering control and no operation. Cognitive failures in motor-planning are determined by comparing the classified motor-planning class of the driver with the ground truth class obtained from the co-pilot through a hand-held rotary switch. Lastly, failure in motor execution is detected, when the time-delay between the onset of motor imagination and the EMG response exceeds a predefined duration. The {{most important aspect of}} the present research lies in cognitive failure classification during the planning phase. The complexity in subjective plan classification arises due to possible overlap of signal features involved in braking, acceleration and steering control. A specialized interval/general type- 2 fuzzy set induced neural classifier is employed to eliminate the uncertainty in classification of motor-planning. Experiments undertaken reveal that the proposed neuro-fuzzy classifier outperforms traditional techniques in presence of external disturbances to the driver. Decoding of visual alertness and motor-execution are performed with kernelized support vector machine classifiers.
