40|$|A {{model for}} the growth of a catalyst-polymer {{particle}} during gas-phase polymerization of (alpha) -olefins is developed. In order to design the polymerization reactor, the behavior of a pellet is analyzed through the model. ^ Low-pressure, gas-phase polymerization processes use various heterogeneous catalysts, supported and unsupported. Initial catalyst particles break into small fragments, kept in contact through polymer entanglements. This phenomenon creates a pellet formed by the aggregation of thousands of microparticles, each with a catalyst micronucleus surrounded by a growing polymer layer. Monomer diffuses from the gas phase to the active sites {{on the surface of the}} micronucleus. This process include transport within the pellet along the voids among microparticles, and through their growing polymer layer. <b>Heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>polymerization</b> must be transferred from the active sites to the bulk phase. ^ Approximate analytical solutions are developed to model the heat and mass transfer in the microparticle. A multigrain model combines these solutions to predict transport in the pellet. The analytical solutions make the separate treatment of the microparticle and pellet scales tractable. Consequently, fragmentation steps are included in the model. Polymerization and pellet growth rates are predicted. ^ Results show energy transfer effects are critical during initial steps of the pellet growth. Thermal runaways leading to polymer melting are possible if heat transfer to the bulk phase is inadequate. Catalyst fragmentation and overheating phenomena occur at the same time scale, and their interaction is important. Diffusion effects in the pellet are critical at the initial growth steps and during thermal excursions. Time scales for these processes are much shorter than the pellet total reaction times. Thus, transport through the pellet has little effect on the molecular weight distribution of the polymer. ^ The pellet model is applied to the base-case design of a fluidized-bed reactor. The fluid velocity and reactor dimensions are predicted. The model is used to analyze the effects of the reactor environment on the polymerization process. ...|$|E

The effective rate coefficient of propagation, k(p) (eff) was determined in bulk and solution of cyclohexanone (DCHI) and N-methylformamide (DMI) for monomer concentrations between 1. 5 < c(M) (0) < 7. 1 mol L- 1 in the temperature range 0 < T < 90 degrees C. The resulting Arrhenius plots (i. e., In k(p) (eff) vs 1 /RT) displayed a significant curvature in the higher temperature regimes and were analyzed in their respective linear parts to yield the activation parameters of the forward reaction. In the temperature region where no depropagation was observed, the following set of Arrhenius parameters for k(p) were obtained for the bulk systems: DCHI (E-p 26. 5 M mol(- 1), In A(p) /L mol(- 1) s(- 1) = 11. 5), DBI (E-p = 21. 3 kJ mol(- 1), In A(p) /L mol(- 1) s(- 1) = 10. 4), DMI (E-p 27. 8 kJ mol(- 1), In A(p) /L mol(- 1) s(- 1) = 13. 5). In addition, the k(p) (eff) data were analyzed in the depropagation regime for DCHI, resulting in estimates for the associated enthalpy and entropy (Delta H = - 53. 5 M mol(- 1) and AS = - 142. 3 J mol(- 1) K- 1) of polymerization. The value for the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>polymerization</b> was independently measured via on-line differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as well (Delta H = - 55. 0 kJ mol(- 1)).

40|$|In the past, {{the only}} option for {{replacing}} broken or otherwise malfunctioning hip bones was total hip replacement (THR), which involved {{the removal of the}} body's natural hip joint and replacing it with an entirely synthetic joint. However, the complications involved with such extensive surgery have led to the push for less invasive therapies. One such idea that has gained popularity for younger patients is hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA), which focuses on repairing the joint rather than entirely replacing it. However, there are some issues with HRA, namely thermal bone necrosis due to the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>polymerization</b> during cement hardening. This paper examines this necrosis as well as the thermal trends of hip resurfacing surgery through the use of COMSOL, a computer aided engineering tool. In COMSOL, a 2 D-axisymetric geometry was developed to model the leg bone, cement, ball, cap, and the hipbone. Boundary condition and initial condition was set to portray a realistic surgical environment. With the objective of minimizing bone necrosis, the model's parameters were adjusted to simulate a variety of material properties (different prosthetic material, and different bone conditions), as well as plausible surgical conditions (pre-cooled cement, and convective cooling). Sensitivity analysis was also conducted {{to gain a better understanding}} of the thermal tendencies of HRA. Based on the data from these simulations we were able to provide some insight into what approaches may be best for minimizing the extent of the thermal necrosis. The following paragraphs describe the most significant among these conclusions. First of all, we found that precooling the implant from room temperature to 5 degrees C resulted in a drop in the maximum temperature by 7 degrees C. It appears that precooling the cement in addition to the implant had no additional significant temperature reduction. Also, our sensitivity analysis revealed that our system was most sensitive to changes in precooling temperature. All of these factors seem to suggest that precooling may be an effective means for reducing thermal bone necrosis. Secondly, simulations of cancellous bone showed a maximum temperature lower than that of normal bone. As cancellous bone is typical of elderly patients, these results suggest that there is a lower risk of complications due to thermal necrosis during HRA for elderly patients than for younger individuals. Third, when varying our parameters, we often incurred computational failure due to the presence of "hot spots," small regions of the cement that reached extremely high values. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that our system at its default parameter values was extremely close to values that resulted in these hot spots. While it's questionable if these hot spot events are consistent with realistic physics, the topic deserves further investigation considered the potentially damaging results. While our model does not conclusively provide guidelines for reducing thermal necrosis, it does provide some ideas for successful prevention. Computational analysis as a first step helps us understand the thermal effects of HRA and sets the stage for subsequent experimentation...|$|E

40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{polymerization}}.</b> With {{the use of}} a Tian-Calvet microcalorimeter, the heats of polymerization of {{a number}} of monomers have been measured in aqueous emulsion systems; the emulsifying agent was cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and initiation was by Fenton's reagent (Fe++ + H 2 O 2). The monomers employed were acrylic acid, methyl, ethyl and butyl acrylates, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2 -hydroxypropyl methacrylate, methacrylic acid, and methyl, ethyl, butyl and hexyl methacrylates. The heats of polymerization lie in the range from 13 to 19 kcal per mole, the experimental standard deviation being 40 to 110 cal per mole. A steady increase was observed for acrylic acids and its CH 3, C 2 H 5 and C 4 H 9 esters, and for methacrylic acid and its CH 3, C 2 H 5, C 4 H 9 C 6 H 13 esters. This change is attributed to a steady increase in the proportion of head to head, tail to tail polymers, leading to a decrease in steric hindrance in the polymer. Abnormally low heats observed with hydroxyethyl methacrylate and 2 -hydroxypropyl methacrylate are attributed to the solvation of the monomer, less solvation being possible in the polymer as a result of shielding. Kinetics of polymerization. The microcalorimeter has been used to obtain rates of polymerization of a number of monomers in emulsion systems. The rates with the acrylates are consistently higher than those with the methacrylates, and this is attributed to there being less steric hindrance in the acrylate polymerization. Low rates found with the monomers containing a hydroxyl groups are explained as due to solvation in the initial monomer state. In both the acrylates and methacrylates the rates go through a maximum as one goes up the series methyl: ethyl: butyl: hexyl. This is discussed in terms of inductive and steric effects. Heats of vaporization. Heats of vaporization of fourteen alcohols, having from one to five carbon atoms, have been determined in a Calvet microcalorimeter, using a special technique. The method consisted of allowing the alcohol to vaporize into a vacuum, the heat required for the vaporization being provided by passing a current through a resistance wire which was immersed in oil in a U-tube surrounded by the alcohol. The additivity scheme previously devised by Laidler for heats of formation and related properties was applied to the results, and the agreement with experiment was within a few tenth of a percent. Additivity. An empirical bond energy scheme has been derived and applied to several physico-chemical properties of several families of compounds. The scheme proposed is a modification of Tatevskii's scheme. It defines three types of C-H bonds and several types of C-C bonds depending on their multiplicity and their environment. Other functional groups (e. g. -CHO, -COH) have been considered as a group and have been treated as such. They are assigned group symbols and their contribution to the physico-chemical property is a group contribution. The scheme has been applied to alkanes, alkenes, dienes and cylic hydrocarbons for the following properties; molar volume, molar refraction, entropy of formation and heat of atomization, all at 25 °C.
