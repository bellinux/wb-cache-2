40|$|A {{leveling}} apparatus for {{the precise}} adjustment {{of a scientific}} instrument is reported. A base member is provided having a hollow cylindrical shape. A table for supporting the instrument rests on the base and has a shaft portion extending below the table. The upper portion of the shaft fits tightly into the hollow portion of the base member whereas the lower portion of the shaft is machined to fit loosely. The lower portion of the shaft is provided with a groove. <b>Adjusting</b> <b>screws</b> are threaded through the hollow cylindrical portion and are adapted to enter the groove. By <b>adjusting</b> the <b>screws,</b> the lower portion of the shaft is moved in a vertical plane since the shaft is loosely fitted into the cylinder. The upper portion of the shaft which is tightly fitted into {{the upper end of}} the cylinder causes the cylinder to deform slightly providing a fulcrum point which allows the table to be leveled in response to the adjustment of the <b>adjusting</b> <b>screws...</b>|$|R

50|$|The ink {{fountain}} holds {{a pool of}} ink and controls the amount of ink that enters the inking system. The {{most common type of}} fountain consists of a metal blade that is held in place near the fountain roller. The gap between the blade and the {{ink fountain}} roller can be controlled by <b>adjusting</b> <b>screw</b> keys to vary the amount of ink on the fountain roller. The printer adjusts the keys in or out as the ink fountain roller turns to obtain the desired quantity of ink. In simple presses, the printer must turn these screws by hand. In modern presses, the <b>adjusting</b> <b>screws</b> are moved by servomotors which are controlled by the printer at a press console. Thus the printer can make ink adjustments electronically. If the printer needs to increase or decrease ink in an area of the plate (print), he need only adjust the needed keys to allow more or less ink flow through the blade. The ink flow can also be controlled by the rotation velocity of the ink fountain roller.|$|R
