Non-state actors who are more fl exible and responsive to diversifi ed demands of civil society pretend to e capable to build an alternative for the contemporary state and world order.

Although the subscription-funded television service M-Net was launched in 1986, the SABC had a monopoly on free-to-air television until the launch of e.tv in 1998.|$|R
5000|$|Broadcasting {{began on}} 7 August 1939 by Jacques Trémoulet, {{who was also}} {{the owner of the}} {{broadcasting}} company Radiophonie du Midi, which was already broadcast in Toulouse, Montpellier, Bordeaux and Agen. With the location of Andorra <b>it</b> bypassed the <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> on broadcasting by not operating on French soil. On its first broadcast Radio Andorra was exclusively a music programme, interrupted only by the famous greeting [...] "Aqui Radio Andorra." [...] During the Second World War, the music programme was broadcast to the soldiers in France to North Africa. Both German and Allied forces attempted to control the radio without success because the neutrality of Andorra served as a protective shield.|$|R

The first broadcast with sound took place in 1923, and the first broadcast of a theatrical event from the Lido theater on the Champs-Élysées in February 1933. The first official government broadcast was organized by Minister Georges Mandel on April 26, 1935. The audience for television in Paris at this time was extremely small; there were between five hundred and one thousand receivers.

Until 1998 <b>it</b> was a <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> (though {{there was a}} short-lived local private channel from 1966 to 1971, known as Teletigre). There are two privately owned TV networks and three state-owned TV networks with national coverage, as well as six regional TV networks and dozens of local TV stations.

These cable companies also develop their own channels, {{in addition to a}} variety of international channels. Television in Colombia has always relied on technological advancements from developed countries importing almost all the equipment.|$|R
50|$|During Ibrahim's {{engagement}} in the second Arabian campaign, the pasha {{turned his attention to}} further strengthening the Egyptian economy, and his control over <b>it.</b> He created <b>state</b> <b>monopolies</b> for the chief products of the country, and created a number of factories. In 1819 he began digging the new Mahmoudiyah Canal to Alexandria, named after the reigning Sultan of Turkey. The old canal had long fallen into decay, and the necessity of providing a safe channel between Alexandria and the Nile was much felt. The conclusion of the commercial Treaty of Balta Liman in 1838 between Turkey and Britain, negotiated by Sir Henry Bulwer (Lord Darling), struck the death knell to the system of monopolies, though its application regarding Egypt was delayed for some years, and finally included foreign intervention.|$|R
50|$|Faced with a {{situation}} of extreme material hardships, the Soviet Government introduced the policies of War Communism. It took under its control the middle-sized and small industries, in addition to large-scale industry, so as to accumulate goods for the supply {{of the army and}} the agricultural population. <b>It</b> introduced a <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> of the grain trade, prohibited private trading in grain and established the surplus-appropriation system, under which all surplus produce {{in the hands of the}} peasants was to be registered and acquired by the state at fixed prices, so as to accumulate stores of grain for the provisioning of the army and the workers. Lastly, it introduced universal labour service for all classes. In the viewpoint of the party, the principle of 'He who does not work, neither shall he eat' was put into practice.|$|R

40|$|In Switzerland {{there are}} seven cantons where the housing {{insurance}} market is competitive, while in the 19 others there are local <b>state</b> <b>monopolies.</b> This paper compares the price/performance relationship of these different market forms. It is shown that for a very similar product the <b>state</b> <b>monopolies</b> charge 70 % lower prices, that they spend substantially more on fire prevention, {{and that they have}} much lower damage rates. One of the main reasons for the higher prices of the private insurance companies is the fact that they spend considerably more on sales and administrative costs. The housing insurance market is thus a classic example of a situation where <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> outperforms private sector competition...|$|R
