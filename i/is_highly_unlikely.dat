A sensitive serum pregnancy test is typically obtained to rule out ectopic pregnancy. Culdocentesis will differentiate hemoperitoneum (ruptured ectopic pregnancy or hemorrhagic cyst) from pelvic sepsis (salpingitis, ruptured pelvic abscess, or ruptured appendix).|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that Nicholas {{was born}} {{later than the}} 1230s, as he was styled Magister by 1259, {{indicating}} that by that date he possessed a Master's degree.

5|$|Thomas F. Wilson, {{known for}} playing the {{character}} Biff Tannen in the Back to the Future films, began his recurring role as policeman Stan Carter. In the comic books, Stan Carter was a vicious serial killer {{by the name of}} Sin-Eater. Due to the show being for youth-oriented audiences, it <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> the series will make him the murdering alter-ego.|$|E

5|$|Francium-223 is {{the most}} stable isotope, with a {{half-life}} of 21.8minutes, and it <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is the fifth product of the actinium decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium-227. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1149keV decay energy), with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4MeV decay energy).|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians mummified many animal species, from {{cats and}} gazelles to crocodiles, baboons, and birds. Typically, many animal species were {{consumed}} as meat after death, but it <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that dogs {{would have been}} eaten. Radiographs of exhumed dogs {{in the ancient world}} have revealed that the mummification process involved wrapping the embalmed bones together with bandages and placing them within a wooden statue of Anubis, the jackal-headed deity associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{claimed that}} {{there was no mention of}} the case in police records held by {{archives}} in Adelaide, but that instead, the incident had been related to him by residents of the district who had known Brown. He also placed it as having occurred between 1860 and 1870. Foster et al. note that this date <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely,</b> as frontier violence in the district began when squatters arrived in 1843, and was tapering off by 1848 when the murders occurred. By the 1860s, Aboriginal labour was highly sought after by pastoralists in the district due to the exodus of white labourers to the Victorian gold rush.|$|E

5|$|However, it <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that single-story {{structures}} such as {{mobile homes}} can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, the {{smallest}} possible object that could possess an absolute magnitude of +1 (a perfectly reflective {{one with an}} albedo of 1) would be 838km in diameter. It <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that any body of this size or larger, regardless of composition, would not also surpass whatever threshold is ultimately adopted as proof of hydrostatic equilibrium. However, {{if it turns out}} upon further investigation that an object named {{as if it were a}} plutoid has not achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, the IAU has stated it will be reclassified, but keep its name.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} Pacific Coast {{breakpoints}} in the United States. They are, {{from north to}} south, Point Piedras Blancas, Point Sal, Point Conception, Point Mugu, {{the mouth of the}} San Gabriel River, San Mateo Point, and the mouth of the Tijuana River (although places outside this area can be selected if conditions warrant). Should there be the threat of landfall, warnings or watches would be issued for those sections of coast. It <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that any tropical cyclone will threaten areas farther north due to the stronger influence of the California Current.|$|E
5000|$|True microfossils should {{fit within}} a {{well-established}} evolutionary context (for example, complex microfossils <b>are</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> to exist at 3.5 billion years, {{as they have}} yet to evolve from their more simple cellular ancestors).|$|R

5|$|By-catch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape once they are entangled <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to his homeland, Pyrrhus {{found himself in a}} {{difficult}} position. His Italian sojourn had emptied his coffers and crippled his army, leaving him reliant on Sicilian mercenaries who required payment. In order to secure funds to pay his troops, Pyrrhus planned a war against Antigonus II Gonatas, the new king of Macedon. Citing Antigonus' refusal to provide him with aid during his Italian expedition as a casus belli, Pyrrhus invaded Macedon in the spring of 274 BC. He was accompanied by an army consisting of 8,000 infantry and 500 cavalry although their numbers were probably augmented by Gallic mercenaries. It has been speculated that by invading Macedon, Pyrrhus was acting as the agent of the monarchs of Ptolemaic Egypt, Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, however N. G. L. Hammond posits that this <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely.</b>|$|E
5|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds {{may be a}} visual manifestation of a {{low-level}} mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.|$|E

5000|$|Openshaw {{argued that}} it <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that any act {{considered}} [...] "homosexual" [...] would have been defended by the disciples (homosexuality was rigorously repressed in Indian society of the time), let alone immortalised in print by a devotee.|$|R
5000|$|Major Riley was a {{teetotaler}} and his sobriety, leadership, {{ambition and}} example was commented on by {{several people who}} knew him. Even those who condemned his desertion were aware of these qualities. A death from drunkenness would have <b>been</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely.</b>|$|R
5|$|The coins {{struck by}} Beonna's last known moneyer, Wilred, are so {{different}} from Efe's that it <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that they were produced at the same mint or at the same time. It can also be assumed that Wilred is the same moneyer who struck coins for Offa of Mercia, possibly at Ipswich. Wilred's coins {{can be used to}} demonstrate that Offa's influence over the East Angles occurred at an earlier date than has previously been supposed, but are of little use in determining a secure chronology for Beonna's reign. Wilred's name is always depicted in runes. Nearly all his reverse dies have two crosses placed between the elements of his name (+ wil + red): most of the obverse dies show crosses and the king's name in a similar design, but also include an extra rune. This unique rune, similar to ·öπ, possibly meant walda ('ruler').|$|E
5|$|Thucydides {{says that}} 200 Phoenician ships were {{captured}} and destroyed. It <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that this {{occurred during the}} apparently brief naval battle, so these were probably grounded ships captured after the battle and destroyed with fire, {{as has been the}} case at Mycale. Plutarch says that 200 ships were captured, in addition to those that were destroyed or fled. It is possible that 'destroyed' in this context means sunk during the battle, since the Greeks would almost certainly have destroyed the ships that they captured as well (as Thucydides indeed implies). Since Thucydides only explicitly gives the number of ships destroyed, it is possible to reconcile Plutarch's and Thucydides's numbers, {{but it is not clear}} that this is the best approach. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for casualties amongst the troops of either side.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> {{that this}} {{reaction}} {{will be able}} to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of einsteinium-254, which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms,Es|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=122|pages=411‚Äì417|year=1986|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(86)90435-2|first10=R.

L.|displayauthors=9}} to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories, and in quantities smaller than those needed for effective synthesis of ultraheavy elements. However, given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table, it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions, and indeed attempts to synthesise it in 2019 and 2020 are currently planned at laboratories at Japan and Russia. Currently, none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet, and it is also possible, due to drip instabilities, that only the lower period 8 elements, up to around element 128, are physically possible. No attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals, such as unhexpentium, due to their extremely high atomic number: they would require new, more powerful technology to make.|$|E
50|$|With {{the death}} of King Fahd in August 2005, some felt it was still {{possible}} that Yamani {{would return to the}} Saudi Government under King Abdullah, most likely as an ambassador, but sources close to Yamani indicated that it <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely.</b>|$|R
25|$|During the Syrian Occupation of Lebanon (1976‚Äì2005), it <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> <b>unlikely</b> that Lebanon {{would sign}} {{a peace treaty}} with Israel before Syria, as Syria's {{influence}} on Lebanese politics was strong; however, the Syrian Occupation withdrew from Lebanon, yet the Iran‚ÄìSyria‚ÄìHezbollah axis remained through the heavy arms presence.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 a {{paper was}} {{published}} in Marine Geology which critically analysed Abbott's claims regarding {{the origin of the}} Mahuika crater.

25|$|A high-energy alpha {{particle}} was observed and taken as possible {{evidence for the}} synthesis of unbihexium.
