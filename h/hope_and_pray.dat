[...] Manning said his priorities ranked in order are [...] "...faith, family, friends, and football." [...] Manning said he prays every night and before games and added, [...] "I <b>hope</b> (<b>and</b> <b>pray)</b> I don't do too many things that displease Him before I get to Heaven myself. I believe, too, that life is much better and freer when you're committed to God in that way." ...|$|E
500|$|All {{of these}} new things {{entering}} my life are changing the way I view my purpose, but 'Dance in the Dark' in particular is about me wanting to live—but also, the song isn't called 'Dance in the Light'. I'm not a gospel singer trying to cross people over. What I'm saying is, 'I get it. I feel you, I feel the same way, and it's OK.' I <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> that I can inspire some sort of change in people subliminally through the show. They're singing 'Dance in the Dark,' but they're dancing and they're free, they're letting it out. But the songs are not about freedom, they're about [...] I get it. I feel the way you feel.|$|E

Brother Kevin Crowley of the Centre was quoted in Hot Press [...] "Our numbers get bigger and bigger, we have 200 people {{in the morning and}} nearly 500 in the evening for dinner. [...] So the whole charity concert was a tremendous success, a huge boost. [...] When Bell X1 came to present the cheque I was so impressed by their kindness and sensitivity. [...] I would <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray,</b> and I have no doubt, that they will be a huge success for years to come." [...] Hot Press reported that the show raised €20,285 and the day Centre received a further €225,000 due to the awareness raised.|$|E
2500|$|America needs Orthodoxy, without Orthodoxy {{becoming}} Americanized. Orthodoxy {{must continue}} to develop in spirituality and maturity, growing gradually and appropriately toward a developed polity. I am concerned that aggressive attempts toward premature separation from the mother churches of the old lands will result in disarray and schism. [...] Instead, we are called by the Lord to continue in humble growth and obedience to our organic link with the Patriarchates.

He had a quick eye for such matters; so quick an eye that he deplored {{on the present}} occasion her ladyship's entire lack {{of a sense of}} humor.

2500|$|On July 14, 2009, the Episcopal Church's House of Bishops voted that [...] "any ordained ministry" [...] {{is open to}} gay men and lesbians.

2500|$|The {{president}} of the Independent Democrats, Patricia de Lille, told the court she was handed information by people whose identity she did not disclose. She first asked for a commission of inquiry into the arms deal. When that was refused she asked Mbeki to issue a proclamation to allow the Heath unit to investigate. She said that her [...] "role was {{to pass on the}} information and <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> that it will be investigated. I was ostracised, but I did it {{for the people of the}} country.

When it became clear that neither Gasparri nor del Val could win, the cardinals approached Ratti, thinking him a compromise candidate not identified with either faction. Cardinal Gaetano de Lai approached Ratti and was believed to have said: [...] "We will vote for Your Eminence if Your Eminence will promise that you will not choose Cardinal Gasparri as your secretary of state". Ratti is said to have responded: [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> that among so highly deserving cardinals the Holy Spirit selects someone else. If I am chosen, it is indeed Cardinal Gasparri whom I will take to be my secretary of state".|$|E

Well she knew, if the event in the tannery shed had not made him abandon his affairs, no appeal could do so. Her happiest days in this period were the Saturdays and Sundays spent with him in Coniston, and as the weeks went by she began {{to believe that the}} change, miraculous as it seemed, had indeed taken place. He had given up his power. It was a {{pleasure}} that made the weeks bearable for her. What did it matter--whether he had made the sacrifice {{for the sake of his}} love for her? He had made it.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{denying the}} {{existence}} of purgatory as formulated in Roman Catholic doctrine, [...] the Anglican and Methodist traditions along with Eastern Orthodoxy, affirm {{the existence of}} an intermediate state, Hades, and thus pray for the dead, as do many Lutheran Churches, such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which [...] "remembers the faithful departed in the Prayers of the People every Sunday, including those who have recently died and those commemorated on the church calendar of saints". Eastern Orthodox Churches believe in the possibility of a change of situation for the souls of the dead through the prayers of the living and the offering of the Divine Liturgy, and many Orthodox, especially among ascetics, <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> for a general apocatastasis. Judaism also believes in the possibility of after-death purification and may even use the word [...] "purgatory" [...] to present its understanding of the meaning of Gehenna.|$|E
2500|$|The same General Convention also voted that [...] "any ordained ministry" [...] {{is open to}} gay men and lesbians. The New York Times {{said the}} move was [...] "likely to send shockwaves through the Anglican Communion." [...] This vote ended a {{moratorium}} on ordaining gay bishops passed in 2006 and passed in spite of Archbishop Rowan Williams's personal call {{at the start of}} the convention that, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> that there won't be decisions in the coming days that will push us further apart." [...] A noted Evangelical scholar of the New Testament, N.T. Wright, who is also Bishop of Durham in the Church of England, wrote in The Times (London) that the vote [...] "marks a clear break with the rest of the Anglican Communion" [...] and formalizes the Anglican schism. [...] However, in another resolution the Convention voted to [...] "reaffirm the continued participation" [...] and [...] "reaffirm the abiding commitment" [...] of the Episcopal Church with Anglican Communion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{notion of}} purgatory is {{associated}} {{particularly with the}} Latin Rite of the Catholic Church (in the Eastern sui juris churches or rites it is a doctrine, though often without using the name [...] "Purgatory"); Anglicans of the Anglo-Catholic tradition generally also hold to the belief. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, believed in an intermediate state between death and the final judgment and {{in the possibility of}} [...] "continuing to grow in holiness there." [...] The Eastern Orthodox Churches believe in the possibility of a change of situation for the souls of the dead through the prayers of the living and the offering of the Divine Liturgy, and many Orthodox, especially among ascetics, <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> for a general apocatastasis. A similar belief in at least the possibility of a final salvation for all is held by Mormonism. Judaism also believes in the possibility of after-death purification and may even use the word [...] "purgatory" [...] to present its understanding of the meaning of Gehenna. However, the concept of soul [...] "purification" [...] may be explicitly denied in these other faith traditions.|$|E

2500|$|At his {{arraignment}} at the District Court of Pittsburg County on June 4, 2002, Duty asked Judge Steven Taylor {{to enter}} a guilty plea to the murder and requested the death penalty, {{against the advice of}} his defense counsel. On October 28 of that year, Duty was deemed competent to enter the plea after court-ordered evaluations by the Carl Albert Community Mental Health Center and Eastern Oklahoma State Hospital. While testifying on his own behalf, Duty declined to present any mitigating evidence and said that he preferred death over spending a life sentence in lockdown 23 hours day. He also wrote to the prosecutor that he would kill again. Mary Wise pleaded to the court to sentence Duty to life in prison without the possibility of parole, stating: [...] "I don't believe he ought to have a choice. I think he ought to sit in that cell and face those four walls and think about what he did {{for the rest of his}} natural-born life. And I <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> to God that you live to be 110 years old, because that's how long I want you to think about what you did." [...] Judge Taylor denied her request, calling Duty a [...] "textbook case for the death penalty". Duty was initially scheduled to be executed on February 24, 2005.|$|E
