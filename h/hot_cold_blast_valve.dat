5000|$|A {{kerosene}} lantern, {{also known}} as a [...] "barn lantern" [...] or [...] "hurricane lantern," [...] is a flat-wick lamp made for portable and outdoor use. They are made of soldered or crimped-together sheet metal stampings, with tin-plated sheet steel being the most common material, followed by brass and copper. There are three types: Dead flame, <b>hot</b> <b>blast,</b> and <b>cold</b> <b>blast.</b> Both <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> and <b>cold</b> <b>blast</b> designs are called tubular lanterns and are safer than dead flame lamps as tipping over a tubular lantern cuts off the oxygen flow to the burner and will extinguish the flame within seconds.|$|R
5000|$|Later {{lanterns}} {{such as the}} <b>Hot</b> <b>Blast</b> and <b>Cold</b> <b>Blast</b> lanterns {{took this}} airflow control even further by partially enclosing the wick in a [...] "deflector" [...] or [...] "burner cone" [...] and channeling the airflow through that restricted area creating a brighter and even more stable flame.|$|R
50|$|R.E. Dietz Company was a {{lighting}} products manufacturer. They {{are best}} known for <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> and <b>cold</b> <b>blast</b> kerosene lanterns. The company started in 1840 when its founder, 22-year-old Robert E. Dietz purchased a Lamp & Oil business in Brooklyn, New York. Though famous for well built indoor & outdoor kerosene lanterns, the company was {{a major player in}} the automotive lighting industry from the 1920s through into the 1960s.|$|R

Dust emissions arise from thermal and chemical or physical processes and mechanical actions. Two kinds of fl y dusts from cupola furnaces (<b>hot</b> and <b>cold</b> <b>blast</b> cupola furnace) and fl y dust from electric arc furnace were used by experiments. They were pelletized only with addition of water and briquetted with diff erent addition of water glass, bentonite and cement.

50|$|A {{kerosene}} lamp (usually {{called a}} paraffin lamp in some countries) {{is a type}} of lighting device that uses kerosene (paraffin) as a fuel. Kerosene lamps have a wick or mantle as light source, protected by a glass chimney or globe; lamps may be used on a table, or hand-held lanterns may be used for portable lighting. Like oil lamps, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without rural electrification, in electrified areas during power outages, at campsites, and on boats. There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat wick, central draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp. Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead flame, <b>hot</b> <b>blast,</b> and <b>cold</b> <b>blast</b> variants.|$|R

50|$|Ventilation {{openings}} in a bunker {{must be protected}} by <b>blast</b> <b>valves.</b> A <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> is closed by a shock wave, but otherwise remains open. If the bunker is in a built-up area, it may include water-cooling or an immersion tube and breathing tubes to protect inhabitants from fire storms. In these cases, the secondary exit is also most useful.|$|R

50|$|In bunkers {{inhabited}} for prolonged periods, {{large amounts}} of ventilation or air conditioning must be provided {{in order to prevent}} ill effects of heat. In bunkers designed for war-time use, manually operated ventilators must be provided because supplies of electricity or gas are unreliable. One of the most efficient manual ventilator designs is the Kearny Air Pump. Ventilation openings in a bunker must be protected by <b>blast</b> <b>valves.</b> A <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> is closed by a shock wave, but otherwise remains open.

50|$|The {{discovery}} by James Beaumont Neilson {{in about}} 1825 of the beneficial {{effects of the}} hot blast led to the rapid obsolescence of <b>cold</b> <b>blast</b> ironworks in Great Britain, where hot blast was in general use by 1835. <b>Cold</b> <b>blast</b> ironworks survived longer in the United States, {{but the use of}} hot blast as a method of smelting iron with anthracite was introduced in 1836, and the increasing US production of coke gradually drove out the <b>cold</b> <b>blast</b> furnaces. However, one of the last known operating <b>cold</b> <b>blast</b> charcoal furnaces, Pleasant (formerly Eagle) Furnace, in Curtin, Pennsylvania did not close until 1921.|$|R

50|$|A blast damper is used {{to protect}} {{occupants}} and equipment of a structure against overpressures resultant of an explosion.

50|$|A <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> is used {{to protect}} a shelter, such as a fallout shelter or bunker, {{from the effects of}} sudden outside air {{pressure}} changes. A nuclear weapon creates a shock wave, which may produce sudden pressure changes of more than an atmosphere (about 15 pounds per square inch) even several miles or kilometers from the detonation point. After the shock wave passes, a sudden negative pressure follows.|$|R
5000|$|A typical <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> has entries of 6-12" [...] {{diameter}} (150-300 mm), and {{a larger}} center section. Within the center section is a disk mounted on an axle, with weak springs that keep it centered, away from both entries. Pressure displaces the disk along the axle, until it plugs one entry or the other. After the blast, the springs return the disk to the center, re-opening the valve.|$|R
