25|$|By {{using the}} Google Maps API, it is {{possible}} to embed Google Maps site into an external website, on to which site specific data can be overlaid. Although initially only a JavaScript API, the Maps API was expanded to include an API for Adobe Flash applications (but this has been deprecated), a service for retrieving static map images, and web services for performing <b>geocoding,</b> generating driving directions, and obtaining elevation profiles. Over 1,000,000 web sites use the Google Maps API, making it the most heavily used web application development API.|$|E
25|$|From January 2006, Google Maps {{featured}} road {{maps for}} the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and certain {{cities in the}} Republic of Ireland. Coverage of the area around Turin was added {{in time for the}} 2006 Winter Olympics. On January 23, Google Maps was updated to use the same satellite image database as Google Earth. On March 12, Google Mars was launched, which features a draggable map and satellite imagery of the planet Mars. In April, Google Local was merged into the main Google Maps site. On April 3, version 2 of the Maps API was released. On June 11, Google added <b>geocoding</b> capabilities to the API, satisfying the most developer-requested feature for this service. On June 14, Google Maps for Enterprise was officially launched. As a commercial service, it features intranet and advertisement-free implementations. Also in June, textured 3D building models were added into Google Earth.|$|E
30|$|Both Google Sheets and ggmap {{were able}} to {{successfully}} <b>geocode</b> all 200 addresses, but ggmap incorrectly <b>geocoded</b> eight addresses as being more than 2, 000 miles from their actual location. Addresses containing the ampersand character, &, caused ggmap to incorrectly <b>geocode</b> their location. After replacing the ampersand with the word and, ggmap was able to correctly <b>geocode</b> those addresses. The corrected locations plotted on Google Maps and OSM were similar, and they exactly matched the actual locations when plotted on Google Earth.|$|R

40|$|BackgroundThe Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) {{collects}} maternal address {{information at}} the time of delivery for infants and fetuses with birth defects. These addresses have been <b>geocoded</b> by two independent agencies: (1) the Georgia Division of Public Health Office of Health Information and Policy (OHIP) and (2) a commercial vendor. Geographic information system (GIS) methods were used to quantify uncertainty in the two sets of <b>geocodes</b> using orthoimagery and tax parcel datasets. MethodsWe sampled 599 infants and fetuses with birth defects delivered during 199422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2002 with maternal residence in either Fulton or Gwinnett County. Tax parcel datasets were obtained from the tax assessor's offices of Fulton and Gwinnett County. High-resolution orthoimagery for these counties was acquired from the U. S. Geological Survey. For each of the 599 addresses we attempted to locate the tax parcel corresponding to the maternal address. If the tax parcel was identified the distance and the angle between the <b>geocode</b> and the residence were calculated. We used simulated data to characterize the impact of <b>geocode</b> location error. In each county 5, 000 <b>geocodes</b> were generated and assigned their corresponding Census 2000 tract. Each <b>geocode</b> was then displaced at a random angle by a random distance drawn from the distribution of observed <b>geocode</b> location errors. The census tract of the displaced <b>geocode</b> was determined. We repeated this process 5, 000 times and report the percentage of <b>geocodes</b> that resolved into incorrect census tracts. ResultsMedian location error was less than 100 meters for both OHIP and commercial vendor geocodes; the distribution of angles appeared uniform. Median location error was approximately 35...|$|R
2500|$|An {{address locator}} is a dataset in ArcGIS that stores the address attributes, {{associated}} indexes, and rules {{that define the}} process for translating nonspatial descriptions of places, such as street addresses, into spatial data that can be displayed as features on a map. An address locator contains {{a snapshot of the}} reference data used for <b>geocoding,</b> and parameters for standardizing addresses, searching for match locations, and creating output. Address locator files have a [...]loc file extension. In ArcGIS 8.3 and previous versions, an address locator was called a <b>geocoding</b> service.|$|E

40|$|The {{government}} of Brunei currently is implementing a spatially enabling government {{that requires a}} national <b>geocoded</b> address database as a key building block because a <b>geocoded</b> address database is essential for geoinformation services and location-based services. This paper presents a conceptual model and a framework for Brunei's <b>geocoded</b> address database by investigating the interrelationship among the existing geoinformation resources such as text-based address files, digital cadastral databases, and topographic maps, i. e., the proposed national <b>geocoded</b> address database utilizes reusable components of existing infrastructure. Integrating a reliable dataset to the national <b>geocoded</b> address database using common keys and having an additional attribute as a status flag are the main methods for our framework. We show that the framework is practical for Brunei's spatially enabling government but impacted by quality issues identified during {{the development of the}} framework that are partially solved by using a reference dataset...|$|R

50|$|This current {{decade has}} seen vendors fully {{supporting}} <b>geocoding</b> and reverse <b>geocoding</b> globally. Cloud-based <b>geocoding</b> {{application programming interface}} (API) and on-premise <b>geocoding</b> has allowed for a greater match rate, greater precision, and greater speed. There is now a popularity {{in the idea of}} <b>geocoding</b> being able to influence business decisions. This is the integration between the <b>geocoding</b> process and business intelligence.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 2005, <b>geocoding</b> {{platforms}} included parcel-centroid <b>geocoding.</b> Parcel-centroid <b>geocoding</b> {{allowed for}} a lot of precision in <b>geocoding</b> an address.

50|$|<b>Geocoding</b> {{is a task}} which {{involves}} multiple datasets and processes, all of which work together. A geocoder is made of two important components: a reference dataset and the <b>geocoding</b> algorithm. Each of these components {{are made up of}} sub-operations and sub-components.

5000|$|<b>Geocoding</b> is the {{computational}} {{process of}} transforming a postal address description to a {{location on the}} Earth's surface (spatial representation in numerical coordinates). Reverse <b>geocoding,</b> on the other hand, converts the inputted geographic coordinates to {{a description of a}} location, usually the name of a place or a postal address. <b>Geocoding</b> relies on a computer representation of the street network. <b>Geocoding</b> is sometimes used for conversion from ZIP codes or postal codes to coordinates, occasionally for the conversion of parcel identifiers to centroid coordinates.|$|E
50|$|Reverse <b>geocoding</b> can {{be carried}} out {{systematically}} by services which process a coordinate similarly to the <b>geocoding</b> process. For example, when a GPS coordinate is entered the street address is interpolated from a range assigned to the road segment in a reference dataset that the point is nearest to. If the user provides a coordinate near the midpoint of a segment that starts with address 1 and ends with 100, the returned street address will be somewhere near 50. This approach to reverse <b>geocoding</b> does not return actual addresses, only estimates of what should be there based on the predetermined range. Alternatively, coordinates for reverse <b>geocoding</b> can also be selected on an interactive map, or extracted from static maps by georeferencing them in a GIS with predefined spatial layers to determine the coordinates of a displayed point. Many of the same limitations of <b>geocoding</b> are similar with reverse <b>geocoding.</b>|$|E

The project’s objectives are to provide the ADPH’s cancer prevention programs with a more accurate and cost-effective means of planning, implementing, and evaluating its prevention activities in an outcomes-oriented and population-appropriate manner. The project links <b>geocoded</b> data from the Alabama Statewide Cancer Registry with profiles generated by the National Cancer Institute’s cancer profiling system, Consumer Health Profiles. These profiles have been successfully applied to market-focused cancer prevention messages across the United States. The ADPH and the National Cancer Institute will evaluate the efficacy of using <b>geocoded</b> data and lifestyle segmentation information in strategy development and program implementation.

5000|$|One of {{the first}} steps to {{analyzing}} crime, {{with the use of}} crime mapping, is the generation of pinpoint maps using the process of <b>geocoding.</b> This is the process of embedding coordinate information of crime incidents on city maps. Anyone can gain access to create maps on the Internet using the process of <b>geocoding.</b> <b>Geocoding,</b> however, has many errors that can occur in the process because the process is still being developed. This becomes a problem when utilizing spatial analysis because if the basis of the analysis is not correct, it can distort all the analysis utilized. This becomes a concern because information conveyed on maps, especially on the Internet for the public to view, may not necessarily be correct (Ratcliffe, 2002). [...] Ratcliffe (2002) has created a list of possible problems that can arise with <b>geocoding</b> that should not be overlooked.
