5000|$|Regarding the {{accuracy}} of oral history, Jean-Loup Gassend concludes in the book Autopsy of a Battle [...] "I found that each witness account {{can be broken down}} into two parts: 1) descriptions of <b>events</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> witness participated in directly, and 2) descriptions of <b>events</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> witness did not actually participate in, but that he heard about from other sources. The distinction between these two parts of a witness account is of the highest importance. I noted <b>that</b> concerning <b>events</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> witnesses participated in, the information provided was surprisingly reliable, as was confirmed by comparison with other sources. The imprecision or mistakes usually concerned numbers, ranks, and dates, the first two tending to become inflated with time. Concerning <b>events</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> witness had not participated in personally, the information was only as reliable as whatever the source of information had been (various rumors); that is to say, it was often very unreliable and I usually discarded such information." ...|$|R

5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a trust created where a {{creditor}} has lent {{money to a}} debtor for a particular purpose. In the <b>event</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> debtor uses the money for any other purpose, it is held on trust for the creditor. Any inappropriately spent money can then be traced, {{and returned to the}} creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can be traced back further. There has been much academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E
5|$|Another {{earthquake}} {{struck in}} 1202, {{and it may}} have been after this <b>event</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace of it has been discovered.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, the Storm Prediction Center, National Severe Storms Laboratory and National Weather Service Norman Forecast Office {{moved their}} {{respective}} operations into the newly constructed National Weather Center, near Westheimer Airport.

Galveston City Manager Doug Matthews advised {{residents to}} develop an evacuation plan in the <b>event</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city chose to call for evacuations. The city later decided against ordering an evacuation. School was canceled on August 25 for Beaumont, Port Arthur, and other areas of central Jefferson County, while schools were closed in Dickinson, High Island, Hitchcock, La Marque, Santa Fe, and Texas City on August 26. College of the Mainland, Galveston College, and Texas A University at Galveston were also closed. Emergency management crews in Corpus Christi began testing emergency generators and severe weather gear. The Comal County chapter of the Red Cross placed their disaster alert teams on standby and ready to respond if the hurricane threatened the Corpus Christi area.|$|E

The British Crown obtained title over the island in accordance with legal principles governing the acquisition of territory at that time. This title was maintained by the United Kingdom and its lawful successor, the Republic of Singapore.|$|E

After Zartan announces that Cobra will replace the Joes as the premier U.S. special forces unit, Lady Jaye deduces that someone is impersonating the President, and Roadblock leads them to General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), who provides them with weapons, and helps them infiltrate a fundraising <b>event</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> President will be attending. Lady Jaye steals a sample of the President's DNA and confirms that he is Zartan. They escape after a confrontation with Firefly and Zandar (Matt Gerald), the head of the U.S. Secret Service's Presidential Detail and a member of Cobra.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the fleet}} {{could not be}} used to {{challenge}} the significantly more powerful Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy), Turgut Reis and Barbaros Hayreddin were primarily kept at Nagara to support the coastal fortifications defending the Dardanelles in the <b>event</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Italian fleet attempted to force the straits. On 19 April 1912, elements of the Italian fleet bombarded the Dardanelles fortresses, but the Ottoman fleet did not mount a counterattack. The negative course of the war led many naval officers to join a coup against the Young Turk government; the officers commanding the fleet at Nagara threatened to bring the ships to Constantinople if their demands were not met. With tensions rising in the Balkans, the Ottoman government signed a peace treaty on 18 October, ending the war.|$|E

5|$|The JNA's {{offensive}} operations, directly {{associated with}} the campaign in the east Croatian region of Slavonia, were launched on 20 September. The assault on Croatian positions in Vukovar gradually became the main effort of the campaign as the JNA was repeatedly unable to capture the city. The fighting in and around Vukovar lasted months and eventually drew in the JNA's main armoured force, which had previously been slated to advance west towards Serb-held areas in western Slavonia. In addition to relieving its Vukovar garrison, the JNA wished to dissipate the Croatian forces in the city {{so that they would}} not pose any threat to its rear in the <b>event</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> campaign progressed west of Vinkovci.|$|E
