5|$|Ashburton Playing Fields {{are just}} off Shirley Road, behind the school. The fields were first {{dedicated}} {{as a public}} horse racing course by James I in the early 17th century. Following {{the opening of the}} nearby Woodside railway station in 1871 large numbers of Londoners began travelling to the racecourse. Following pressure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayor</b> of Croydon, concerned about the large crowds, the racecourse was closed in 1890 and replaced with a golf course; this was bought by the council in 1942 and given to public use as playing fields.|$|E
5|$|The Turin {{painting}} was acquired in 1866 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mayor</b> {{of a nearby}} town. Previously it was owned by a professor living {{in the province of}} Alessandria; he bought it from a former nun in that province. The documentation is sketchy, but suggests the nun possessed it early in the 19th century during the dissolution of convents in the area under Napoleon. That a nun owned the painting three centuries after Adornes purportedly bequeathed a van Eyck St Francis to his daughter in a convent, and that the Adornes family owned property in Alessandria, is suggestive, but no evidence exists to confirm a connection.|$|E

Soon afterward, the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO) moved to support retaining SR 125 from Poway to Santee in the county transportation plan, despite opposition from a county supervisor and the mayor of Escondido. Deddeh's bill passed the state Assembly Transportation Committee a month later; in the meeting, Deddeh noted the construction of I-805 to handle the traffic demands of the region, {{as well as a}} lack of funding that would result in the construction being delayed for at least 20 years. Despite a petition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mayor</b> of Escondido, the CPO again declined to remove SR 125 from the county transportation plan in March.|$|E

25|$|After the war, new {{problems}} arose {{especially for the}} citizens of the island of Basilan. The people there found it difficult to appear in courts, pay their taxes, seek help <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mayor</b> and other officials.
