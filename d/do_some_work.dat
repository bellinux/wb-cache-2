5|$|McCulloch met former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr in 1993 {{and they}} wrote and {{recorded}} an album, tentatively titled Touch Down. The album {{was to be}} released in early 1994; however, despite McCulloch and Marr being happy with the album, Rob Dickins at WEA felt it was missing some element. Dickins suggested to McCulloch that Sergeant be brought in to <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>work.</b> McCulloch was initially sceptical because he had not spoken with Sergeant since de Freitas's funeral; however, he did give the idea some thought. Before McCulloch had chance to contact Sergeant, a mutual friend persuaded the pair to meet socially. While McCulloch and Sergeant were being reacquainted, the tapes from the McCulloch and Marr sessions disappeared. McCulloch was not upset about this as he and Sergeant had started working together as Electrafixion.|$|E

25|$|Designated and {{designed}} {{as the major}} shed for the region, it was constructed as a heavy maintenance repair shop. The associated locomotive Factory had access to heavy lifting equipment, and engineering facilities to maintain, repair and overaul all types of GWR locomotive. Locomotives could be put into the Factory roads {{by means of a}} traversing table at the East (Exeter and London) end. The last British Rail steam engine to be overhauled in the workshops was ex-GWR 4500 Class number 4566, outshopped on 15 July 1966. Although some steam engines belonging to the private Dart Valley Railway company were overhauled in the factory after it had closed to BR work, and the old steam shed was also used to <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>work</b> on these privately owned engines.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Wilson {{remembers how}} {{he got a job}} at the local {{airfield}} thanks to Frank's dad. Frank quickly became a pilot, but Wilson didn't have the money to get flight certified and as such became a mechanic and fixed planes. Regardless he was still happy in life and eventually asked Amelia to marry him, and she agreed. That evening Amelia told Lawrence, who strangely didn't say anything at all, and left to <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>work</b> in the field. When Frank found out about the wedding, he privately told Wilson to cancel it saying that Amelia would never settle for a quiet life in Bastion Falls. Wilson ignored his request, confident he would soon have his pilots license and would be able to fly her to the Big City. Suddenly the bell from the hilltop church begins to ring in the Dreamscape, and Wilson heads over there. Once he does he remembers how on the wedding day Amelia never showed up, and she was never seen again. Lawrence blamed her disappearance on Wilson, saying that this would never have happened if he hadn't asked her to marry him.|$|E
500|$|One {{poster for}} the film {{included}} the statement: [...] "Rick Baker, the new master of special effects, who brought you the magic of The Exorcist and gave you the wonder of King Kong, now brings you his greatest creation, The Incredible Melting Man". Although Baker assisted with the effects in The Exorcist (1973), Dick Smith was the makeup artist who primarily worked on that film, not Baker. Exorcist director William Friedkin was so angry about the poster that, upon seeing it on an associate's wall, he tore it down and ripped it to pieces. Baker, {{who did not know}} about the poster in advance, was horrified by the publicity campaign and publicly apologized for it, claiming: [...] "Dick wanted some help so I first went out to <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>work</b> on the dummy whose head turns around 360 degrees. I really didn't do anything creative, I just did labor".|$|E
500|$|With the film's new {{production}} schedule, its intended release date was pushed back to November 2016, and Derrickson {{was able to}} <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>work</b> on the script himself. He brought Cargill in {{to work with him}} on this as was originally planned. Describing the film, Cargill called it both a superhero film and a fantasy film, saying [...] "it's a very magical fantasy universe, {{but at the same time}} it plays by some of the superhero tropes that people enjoy." [...] Spaihts returned later in the process to [...] "do some more writing and help bring the movie home", and said he was [...] "delighted" [...] by the work that Derrickson and Cargill had done in the interim. Feige and Derrickson have noted that, in addition to The Oath and Steve Ditko's original work on Doctor Strange, an influence on all the film's writers was the Doctor Strange comic book Into Shamball.|$|E

500|$|In early 1975, Brando {{signed on}} as Jor-El with a salary of $3.7million and 11.75% of the box office gross profits, totaling $19million. He horrified Salkind by proposing in their first meeting that Jor-El appear as a green {{suitcase}} or a bagel with Brando's voice, but Donner used flattery to persuade the actor to portray Jor-El himself. Brando hoped {{to use some of}} his salary for a proposed 13-part Roots-style miniseries on Native Americans in the United States. Brando had it in his contract to complete all of his scenes in 12 days. He also refused to memorize his dialogue, so cue cards were compiled across the set. Fellow Oscar winner Hackman was cast as Lex Luthor days later. The filmmakers made it a priority to shoot all of Brando's and Hackman's footage [...] "because they would be committed to other films immediately." [...] Though the Salkinds felt that Puzo had written a solid story for the two-part film, they deemed his scripts too long and so hired Robert Benton and David Newman for rewrite work. Benton became too busy directing The Late Show, so David's wife Leslie was brought in to help her husband finish writing duties. George MacDonald Fraser was later hired to <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>work</b> on the script, but he says he did little.|$|E

[...] When Huggins left Warner Bros. {{at the end of that}} year, producer-director Boris Ingster hired her to be the story editor on The Roaring 20s, a new series at Warners for which she also wrote two episodes.|$|E

2500|$|Recording for {{the album}} {{took place during}} 2007 to 2010 at several {{recording}} studios, including Carrington House, Doppler Studios, and Zone 4 Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and Studio at the Palms in Paradise, Nevada. Producers and songwriters having collaborated with Monica on the album include longtime collaborators Jermaine Dupri, Missy Elliott, Bryan-Michael Cox, and his co-producer WyldCard, as well as writers and producers {{that she had not}} worked with in the past, including Jim Jonsin, Bei Maejor, Andre Lindal, Los Da Mystro, singer Ne-Yo, songwriters Ester Dean and Crystal Johnson, Norwegian production duo Stargte and her elder cousin Polow da Don. Over the course of several recording periods, Monica worked on [...] "hundreds of songs" [...] for the album, herself serving as its executive producer and J Records A president Larry Jackson as co-executive. Finally, only ten tracks were selected to be placed on the regular edition of Still Standing while three additional tracks were chosen to be released as free bonus tracks through different retailers. Others songs from established hitmakers such as Dallas Austin, Babyface, Drumma Boy, J Ferrari, Sean Garrett, Jazze Pha, and Soulshock & Karlin did not make the cut. Monica's team also was in negotiations with R. Kelly to contribute to Still Standing. In an interview, Lil Jon moreover stated that he was [...] "about to <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>work</b> with Monica." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, the notion of women serving in the Navy or Marine Corps (both {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Department of the Navy) was not widely supported by the Congress or by the branches of the military services. Nevertheless, there were some who believed that women would eventually be [...] needed in the military. The most notable was Edith Nourse Rogers, Representative of Massachusetts, and Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of the president, who helped pave the way for its reality. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed what would become Public Law689 on 30July 1942, it established a Women's Reserve as a branch of the Naval Reserve for the Navy and Marine Corps. The idea behind the law was to free up officers and men for combat, with women standing in for them at shore stations on the home front. Women could now serve in the WR as an officer or at an enlisted level, with ranks or ratings consistent with those of men. WR volunteers could only serve for the duration of the war, plus six months. The Corps delayed formation of the WR until 13February 1943. It was the last service branch to accept women into its ranks, and [...] "there was considerable unhappiness about making the Marine Corps anything but a club for white men". In fact, General Thomas Holcomb, Commandant of the Marine Corps, was a well-known opponent of women serving in the corps. But he later reversed himself, saying, [...] "there's hardly any work at our Marine stations that women can't do as well as men. They <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>work</b> far better than men. … What is more, they're real Marines. They don't have a nickname, and they don't need one." [...] Holcomb rejected all acronyms or monikers for the WR; he did not believe they were compulsory. And there were many of them, including: Femarines, WAMS, BAMS, Dainty Devil-Dogs, Glamarines, Women's Leatherneck-Aides, MARS, and Sub-Marines. By the summer of 1943, attempts to pressure the WR into a nickname had diminished. WR was as far as Holcomb would move in that direction.|$|E
