40|$|A rat {{cortical}} spreading depression (CSD) {{model was}} established to explore whether cerebral mitochondria injury was induced by CSD under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions and whether flunarizine had a protective effect on cerebral mitochondria. SD rats, which were divided into seven groups, received treatment as follows: no intervention (control Group I); 1  M NaCl injections (Group II); 1  M KCl injections (Group III); intraperitoneal flunarizine (3  mg/kg) 30  min before KCl injections (Group IV); 14 % O 2 inhalation before NaCl injections (Group V); 14 % O 2 inhalation followed by KCl injections (Group VI); 14 % O 2 inhalation and intraperitoneal flunarizine followed by KCl injections (Group VII). Following treatment, brains were removed {{for the analysis of}} mitochondria transmembrane potential (MMP) and oxidative respiratory function after recording the number, amplitude and duration of CSD. The duration of CSD was significantly longer in <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> than that in Group III. The number and duration of CSD in Group VII was significantly lower than that in <b>Group</b> <b>VI.</b> MMP in <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> was significantly lower than that in Group III, and MMP in Group VII was significantly higher than that in <b>Group</b> <b>VI.</b> State 4 respiration in <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> was significantly higher than that in Group III, and state 3 respiration in Group VII was significantly higher than that in <b>Group</b> <b>VI.</b> Respiration control of rate in Group VII was also significantly higher than that in <b>Group</b> <b>VI.</b> Thus, we concluded that aggravated cerebral mitochondria injury might be attributed to CSD under hypoxic conditions. Flunarizine can alleviate such cerebral mitochondria injury under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Neer <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> {{proximal}} humeral fractures {{often are}} related to persistent disability despite surgical treatment. We retrospectively compared the outcome after open reduction and internal fixation with the PHILOS(®) plate or primary hemiarthroplasty in patients with Neer <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> fractures focusing on complications, shoulder function, health-related quality of life (SF- 36), and potential risk factors for complications. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the PHILOS(®) plate with primary hemiarthroplasty for treatment of specific Neer <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> fractures. We asked whether (1) both procedures have comparable clinical and radiologic complication rates; (2) one procedure is superior in terms of revision rate; (3) objective and subjective shoulder function (Constant-Murley score) and health-related quality of life (SF- 36) were comparable in both groups at final followup; and (4) there are clinical or radiologic predictors for complications in any group? METHODS: Between 2002 and 2007, 44 consecutive patients (mean, 75. 2 years) with a Neer <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> proximal humeral fracture were included. Twenty-two patients treated with a PHILOS(®) plate were compared with 22 patients treated by primary hemiarthroplasty. Both groups were similar in all criteria.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the effects of green propolis extracted in L-lysine (WSDP) and of L- lysine for 40 weeks on induced rat bladder carcinogenesis. METHODS: The animals (groups I, II, III, IV, V and VI) received BBN during 14 weeks. Group I was treated with propolis 30 days prior received BBN, and then these animals were treated daily with propolis; Groups II and III was treated with subcutaneous and oral propolis (respectively) concurrently with BBN. The animals of Group IV were treated L-lysine; Group V received water subcutaneous; and <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> received only to BBN. Among the animals not submitted to carcinogenesis induction, Group VII received propolis, Group VIII received L-lysine and Group IX received water. RESULTS: The carcinoma incidence in Group I was lower than that of control (<b>Group</b> <b>VI).</b> The carcinoma multiplicity in Group IV was greater than in <b>Group</b> <b>VI.</b> All animals treated with L-lysine developed carcinomas, and they were also more invasive in Group IV than in controls. On the other hand, Group VIII showed no bladder lesions. CONCLUSION: The WSDP is chemopreventive against rat bladder carcinogenesis, if administered 30 days prior to BBN, and that L-lysine causes promotion of bladder carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Current {{work has}} shown the {{importance}} of spinal cyclooxygenase (COX) products in facilitatory processes leading to tissue injury induced hyperalgesia. This cascade must originate with free arachidonic acid (AA) released by the activity of spinal phospholipase A 2 's (PLA 2). In the present work, we studied the role of PLA 2 's in spinal sensitization. We first demonstrate the presence of constitutive mRNA in the spinal cord for PLA 2 Groups IB, IIA, IIC, IVA, V and VI by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) and sequencing. Using quantitative-PCR, we found that Group IVA cPLA 2 and <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> iPLA 2 are the predominant PLA 2 messages in the spinal cord. Western blotting and activity assays specific for Group IVA cPLA 2 and <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> iPLA 2 verified {{the presence of these}} enzymes. PLA 2 activity in spinal cord homogenates was suppressed by methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) and arachidonyl trifluoromethylketone (AACOCF 3), mixed inhibitors of Group IVA cPLA 2 and <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> iPLA 2 as well as by bromoenol lactone (BEL), a <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> iPLA 2 inhibitor. The spinal expression of PLA 2 mRNA or protein was not altered in the face of peripheral inflammation. Secondly, we showed that intrathecal (i. t.) administration of MAFP and AACOCF 3, but not BEL, dose-dependently prevented thermal hyperalgesia induced by intraplantar carrageenan as well as formalin-induced flinching. Finally, i. t. injection of AACOCF 3, at antihyperalgesic doses, decreased the release of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) into spinal dialysate evoked by i. t. NMDA, while i. t. injection of BEL had no effect. Taken together, this work points to a role for constitutive Group IVA cPLA 2 in spinal nociceptive processing...|$|R

40|$|Our {{objective}} is to study the nephroprotective activity and antioxidant potential of Bauhinia purpurea unripe pods and bark against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Healthy adult albino rats of either sex (150 - 200 g) were randomly divided into six groups of six animals each Group I (vehicle control) and Group II (negative control). Group III (BBE 200) and Group IV (BBE 400) were administered the ethanolic extract of Bauhinia purpurea bark in doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg/day p. o., respectively, and Group V (BPE 200) and <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> (BPE 400) were administered the ethanolic extract of Bauhinia purpurea unripe pods at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg/day p. o., respectively. All the treatments were given for nine days. Cisplatin in a single dose of 6 mg/kg i. p. was given on the 4 th day to all groups, except the vehicle control group. On the 10 th day, blood and urine were collected for biochemical tests and the rats were sacrificed. The kidney was removed for histology and lipid peroxidation-antioxidant test. Cisplatin caused nephrotoxicity as evidenced by elevated blood urea, serum creatinine and urine glucose, and there was decreased creatinine clearance in Group II as compared with Group I. Administration of BBE and BPE at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg in Group III and <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> caused a dose-dependant reduction {{in the rise of}} blood urea, serum creatinine and urine glucose, and there was a dosedependant increase in creatinine clearance compared with Group II. There was increased catalase and glutathione and decreased malondialdehyde levels in Group II, while BBE 400 (Group IV) and BPE 400 (<b>Group</b> <b>VI)</b> treatments significantly reversed the changes toward normal values.

40|$|Objective To analyse the continence {{outcomes}} of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in suboptimal patients that have challenging continence recovery {{factors such as}} enlarged prostates, elderly patients, higher body mass index (BMI), salvage prostatectomy, and bladder neck procedures before RARP. Patients and Methods From January 2008 through November 2012, 4 023 patients underwent RARP by a single surgeon at our institution. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data identified 3 362 men who had minimum of 1 -year follow-up. This cohort of patients was stratified into six groups: Group I, aged ≥ 70 years (451 patients); Group II, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 (197); Group III, prior bladder neck procedures (103); Group IV, prostate weight ≥ 80 g (280); and Group V, salvage prostatectomy (41). <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> consisted of patients (2 447) with none of these risk factors. Continence outcomes at follow-up were analysed for all groups. Results The continence rate at 1 year and mean (sd) time to continence in different groups were: for patients aged ≥ 70 years, 85. 6 % and 3. 2 (4. 5) months; BMI of ≥ 35 kg/m 2, 87. 8 % and 3. 1 (4. 5) months; prior bladder neck treatment, 82. 4 % and 3. 4 (4. 7) months; prostate weight of ≥ 80 g, 85. 8 % and 3. 3 (4. 4) months; salvage procedures, 51. 3 % and 6. 6 (8. 3) months; and in <b>Group</b> <b>VI</b> (none of the risk factors), 95. 1 % and 2. 4 (3. 2) months. The continence rate was significantly higher in <b>group</b> <b>VI</b> compared with the salvage group (group V) at the different follow-up intervals (P < 0. 001). When compared with the other groups (I-IV), the continence rate, although higher, {{was not statistically significant}} at the different intervals in <b>group</b> <b>VI</b> (no risk). The mean time to continence was significantly lower in <b>group</b> <b>VI</b> compared with the other groups (I-V; P < 0. 001). Conclusions This study has shown that selected risk factors adversely affect the time to return of continence after RARP, yet aside from salvage patients, there was no statistically significant difference demonstrated between the adverse-risk groups included. Patients undergoing salvage RP had significantly lower continence rates at the various intervals compared with the other groups. Patients with the risk factors identified should be counselled concerning expectations for achieving urinary continence...|$|R
