50|$|Autoimmune <b>hypophysitis</b> or Lymphocytic <b>hypophysitis</b> {{is defined}} as {{inflammation}} of the pituitary gland due to autoimmunity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypophysitis</b> is {{commonly}} known as Lymphocytic <b>Hypophysitis</b> because the lymphocytic infiltration was limited to the anterior pituitary.|$|E
50|$|The {{prognosis}} for <b>hypophysitis</b> was variable for each individual. The depending factors for <b>hypophysitis</b> included {{the advancement of}} the mass on the Sella Turcica, percentage of fibrosis, and the body's response to corticosteroids. Through the use of Corticosteroids, the vision defects tend to recover when the gland size began to decrease. The prognoses of {{the limited number of}} reported cases were usually good.|$|E
50|$|Mainly, the {{diagnosis}} of <b>hypophysitis</b> is through exclusion - patients often undergo surgery because they are suspected of having a pituitary adenoma. But, the most accurate diagnosis is using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to find any mass or lesions on the Sella Turcica.|$|E
5000|$|... 80% of {{patients}} with pituitary antibodies also have antibodies to thyroid gland or its hormones. Likewise, 20% of autoimmune thyroid patients also have pituitary antibodies. [...] It follows that a subset of thyroid patients may have a disease related to autoimmune <b>hypophysitis.</b> Recent {{research has focused on}} a defect at the CTLA-4 gene which, coupled with other factors, may result in autoimmunity primarily focusing on certain endocrine glands including the pituitary and thyroid.|$|E
50|$|Autoimmune {{attack of}} the {{pituitary}} gland resulting in reduced hormone production was first discovered {{as a result of}} an autopsy in 1962. The autopsy described destruction of the pituitary and thyroid consistent with autoimmune attack and included atrophy of the adrenal glands. As magnetic resonance imaging became more available diagnosis increased dramatically. At this time it is believed that the disease is far more prevalent than is diagnosed. Nevertheless, autoimmune <b>hypophysitis</b> is frequently referred to as a rare disease and the most recent estimates as to its prevalence give it a value of around 5 per million.|$|E
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that, typically, it takes from 12 to 40 years for autoimmune destruction to present symptoms. However, {{there have been}} cases of isolated attacks {{as a result of}} drug reactions (i.e., use of blocking antibody ipilimumab) or idiopathic events that have presented symptoms which may disappear after relatively short term treatment (i.e., 1 year on corticoids or other immune suppressants). However, more rapid development of the disorder is the rule when it occurs during, or shortly after, pregnancy (even after miscarriage or abortion). Indeed, autoimmune <b>hypophysitis</b> occurs more commonly during and shortly after pregnancy than at any other time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypophysitis</b> is {{a fairly}} newly {{discovered}} disease. There are four categories of symptoms and signs. Most commonly, the initial symptoms are headaches and visual disturbances. Some symptoms are derived from the lesser functioning of the adenohypophyseal hormones. Of the adenohypophyseal hormones, the most frequently affected are corticotropes, lactotropes and gonadotropes, all which {{are found in the}} anterior pituitary. Polyuria is also a common symptom - which results in very dilute urine, as well as polydipsia which means having extreme thirst. Another symptom is hyperprolactinemia, which is when there are abnormally high prolactin levels in the blood. Usually, a mass will be found located on the sella turcica and loss of hormonal function.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic <b>hypophysitis</b> (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} cause of lactation failure is an insufficient secretion of prolactin from the pituitary gland. D2 receptor antagonists, {{which are used}} to treat lactation failure, correct this insufficiency by blocking D2 receptors in the anterior pituitary, which in turn disinhibits prolactin release. Differential diagnosis of lactation failure when prolactin levels are normal or high includes lymphocytic <b>hypophysitis</b> (inflammation of the pituitary gland due to autoimmunity), Sheehan's syndrome (postpartum hypopituitarism due to ischemic necrosis from blood loss and hypovolemia during and after childbirth), and adult growth hormone deficiency, all of which may cause lactation failure in part or full by lack of sufficient GH secretion. Hypopituitarism in general can impair secretion of pituitary hormones such as prolactin and growth hormone (GH) and in turn result in lactation failure.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{cases of}} primary <b>hypophysitis</b> have been {{described}} over the past 25 years with, however, little insight into the cause(s) of this disease.

We studied the pathogenesis of primary <b>hypophysitis</b> by analysing systematically the immune response at the pituitary tissue level of consecutive cases of ‘lymphocytic’ <b>hypophysitis</b> who underwent pituitary biopsy. In order to investigate further the pathogenesis of their diseases we characterized two cases at clinical, cellular and molecular levels. We show here, for the first time, that lymphocytic <b>hypophysitis</b> probably encompasses at least two separate entities.

The other entity represents a process in which T regulatory cells seem to control the immune response, which may not be self- but foreign-targeted. Our data suggest that it may be necessary to biopsy suspected primary <b>hypophysitis</b> and to analyse pituitary tissue with immune markers to guide treatment. Based on our results, <b>hypophysitis</b> driven by an immune homeostatic process should not be treated with immunosuppression, while autoimmune-defined <b>hypophysitis</b> may benefit from it.

40|$|Abstract. A {{previous}} study reported a high prevalence of autoantibodies to alpha-enolase in lymphocytic <b>hypophysitis</b> and these antibodies efficiently distinguished lymphocytic <b>hypophysitis</b> from pituitary tumors.

40|$|Background: Lymphocytic <b>hypophysitis</b> is an organ-specific {{autoimmune}} {{disease of the}} pituitary gland. A specific and sensitive serological test currently does not exist {{to aid in the}} diagnosis. Objective: To identify target autoantigens in lymphocytic <b>hypophysitis</b> and develop a diagnostic assay for these proteins. Design/methods: A pituitary cDNA expression library was immunoscreened using sera from four patients with lymphocytic <b>hypophysitis.</b> Relevant cDNA clones from screening, along with previously identified autoantigens pituitary gland-specific factor 1 a and 2 (PGSF 1 a and PGSF 2) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were tested in an in vitro transcription and translation immunoprecipitation assay. The corticotroph-specific transcription factor, TPIT, was investigated separately as a candidate autoantigen. Results: Significantly positive autoantibody reactivity against TPIT was found in 9 / 86 <b>hypophysitis</b> patients vs 1 / 90 controls (P= 0. 018). The reactivity against TPIT was not specific for lymphocytic <b>hypophysitis</b> with autoantibodies detectable in the sera from patients with other autoimmune endocrine diseases.

Importantly, 8 / 86 patients with lymphocytic <b>hypophysitis</b> had autoantibodies against any two autoantigens in comparison with 0 / 90 controls (P= 0. 0093). Conclusions: TPIT, a corticotroph-specific transcription factor, was identified as a target autoantigen in 10. 5 % of patients with lymphocytic <b>hypophysitis.</b> Further autoantigens related to vesicle processing were also identified as potential autoantigens with different immunoreactivity patterns in patients and controls...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hypophysitis</b> {{is a rare}} {{inflammatory}} {{condition of}} the pituitary gland that has three main histologic subtypes: lymphocytic <b>hypophysitis</b> (LH), granulomatous <b>hypophysitis</b> (GH), and xanthomatous <b>hypophysitis</b> (XH).

In numerous clinical studies, monoclonal antibodies against the immune checkpoints, CTLA 4, PD 1 and PD 1 ligand PDL 1 have shown promising tumor response in {{different type of}} metastatic malignancies. The adverse events are autoimmune-related. The endocrine disorders, <b>hypophysitis</b> and thyroiditis {{are among the most}} common side effects associated with immune checkpoint inhibition treatment. <b>Hypophysitis,</b> a very rare endocrine disorder occurs in about one tenth of the patients receiving anti-CTLA 4 treatment.

40|$|Background: <b>Hypophysitis</b> is an {{umbrella}} {{term for a}} group of disorders involving inflammation of the pituitary gland. A rare occurrence in humans, <b>hypophysitis</b> can produce a range of clinical signs including (but not limited to) visual deficits and diabetes insipidus. Only five cases of canine <b>hypophysitis</b> exist in the literature, all presenting in mature dogs with no visual deficits and a grave outcome. This case report describes the clinical and advanced imaging features of blindness-inducing presumptive <b>hypophysitis</b> in a dog, which rapidly resolved with medical management. Case presentation: A 1 -year-and-seven-month-old neutered male Standard Poodle presented with subacute blindness, ataxia, and polyuria/polydipsia (PUPD). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected a contrast-enhancing pituitary mass with perilesional oedema compromising the optic chiasm. Suspecting neoplasia, anti-inflammatory corticosteroid was commenced prior to radiation therapy planning. Complete resolution of neurological and visual deficits occurred within 12 days of starting steroid treatment. Repeated advanced imaging indicated macroscopic resolution of the lesion. An extended thyroid panel with insulin-like growth factor- 1 analysis supported a diagnosis of <b>hypophysitis.</b> Resolution of PUPD was achieved with tapering courses of prednisolone and desmopressin; the dog has since been clinically normal for 14 months and treatment-free for 11 months. Conclusions: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first instance in which a canine pituitary mass has demonstrated long-term resolution with palliative medical treatment alone, alongside reversal of associated blindness and presumptive diabetes insipidus. We suspect this lesion to be a form of <b>hypophysitis,</b> which should be included among differential diagnoses for pituitary masses, and for subacute blindness in dogs. Where possible, we advocate biopsy-confirmation of <b>hypophysitis</b> prior to timely intervention with anti-inflammatory treatment...|$|E
