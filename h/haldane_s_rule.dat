A basic statistical framework is elucidated for testing Cope 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Rule</b> and some surprising complications are pointed out. If Cope 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Rule</b> is formulated in terms of mean size, then it is not invariant {{to the way in which}} size is measured. If Cope 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Rule</b> is formulated in terms of median size, then it is not invariant to the degree of separation between ancestral and descendant species. Some practical problems in assessing Cope 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Rule</b> are also described. These results have implications for the empirical assessment of Cope 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Rule...</b>|$|R
40|$|We analyse the {{conditions}} under which an (<b>S,s)</b> <b>rule</b> may be derived and compare these with alternative rules. We consider the case of labour demand with fixed adjustment costs. The (<b>S,s)</b> <b>rule</b> implies a specific ordering of choices: downward adjustment, non-adjustment and upward adjustment with the decision of inaction lying crucially in the middle. We may model firms' decisions as an (<b>S,s)</b> <b>rule</b> only if it is possible to characterise unobserved heterogeneity as an exact negative relation between the choice-specific error terms. Assuming that these are normally distributed, the particular ordering of choices implied by the (<b>S,s)</b> <b>rule</b> may be estimated by an ordered probit. We test the (<b>S,s)</b> <b>rule</b> nesting the ordered probit within a multinomial model with correlated error terms. We find that restriction of univariate error distribution is rejected by the data...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Repeating a QC that {{is outside}} 2 SD from the mean (1 : 2 <b>s</b> <b>rule)</b> {{appears to be}} a common practice. Although this formof repeat {{sampling}} is frowned onby many, the comparative power of the approach has not been formally evaluated. METHODS: We computed power functions mathemati-cally and by computer simulation for 4 different 1 : 2 s repeat-sampling strategies, as well as the 1 : 2 <b>s</b> <b>rule,</b> the 1 : 3 <b>s</b> <b>rule,</b> and 2 common QC multirules. RESULTS: The false-rejection rates for the repeat-sampling strategies were similarly low to those of the 1 : 3 <b>s</b> QC <b>rule.</b> The error detection rates for the repeat-sampling strategies approached those of the 1 : 2 <b>s</b> QC <b>rule</b> for moderate to large out-of-control error condi-tions.

He argues not only that the rule is doctrinally intact, but that the principles and spirit that animate Hodge 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> have broad influence in our law of evidence and have utility in the appellate review of unreasonable verdicts.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that modern humans conform to Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule,</b> {{which holds that}} body size in endothermic species will increase as temperature decreases. However, {{there are reasons to}} question the reliability of the findings on which this consensus is based. One of these is that the main studies that have reported that modern humans conform to Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> have employed samples that contain a disproportionately large number of warm-climate and northern hemisphere groups. With this in mind, we used latitudinally-stratified and hemisphere-specific samples to re-assess the relationship between modern human body size and temperature. We found that when groups from north and south of the equator were analyzed together, Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> was supported. However, when groups were separated by hemisphere, Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> was only supported in the northern hemisphere. In the course of exploring these results further, we found that the difference between our northern and southern hemisphere subsamples is due to the limited latitudinal and temperature range in the latter subsample. Thus, our study suggests that modern humans do conform to Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rule</b> but only when there are major differences in latitude and temperature among groups. Specifically, groups must span more than 50 degrees of latitude and/or more than 30 °C for it to hold. This finding has important implications for work on regional variation in human body size and its relationship to temperature...|$|R
