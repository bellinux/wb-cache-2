40|$|Level of {{acculturation}} {{is an indication}} of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to and preference for two or more cultures. In the present study acculturation ranged on a continuum from a strong identification with Puerto Rican culture, to an equal preference for minority and majority culture, to a strong identification with Anglo American culture. It was hypothesized that Hispanic students 2 ̆ 7 level {{of acculturation}} would affect their perceptions of counselors, willingness to self disclose, and preferences for counseling style. ^ Pretesting on a behavioral acculturation scale placed 94 Hispanic undergraduate college students in one of three types: Puerto Rican acculturated, bicultural, and Anglo acculturated. The subjects then viewed a counseling videotape of one of two white female counselors portraying either a directive or a nondirective counseling style. The counseling interview represented an initial counseling session with graduate students portraying the roles of counselor and client. The presenting problem centered around adjustment to college. After viewing the videotape participants rated the counselor on the Counselor Rating Form - Short version, the Counselor Effectiveness Rating Scale, and a modified Jourard Self Disclosure Scale. The scales of these instruments represented the dependent measures. The independent variables were: level of acculturation, counseling style, and sex of subject. ^ Results indicated that acculturation had a significant effect on trustworthiness, counselor understanding, and self disclosure about attitudes and opinions, tastes and interests, and body. Preference for counseling style, as indicated by willingness to see a counselor, was not significantly affected by level of acculturation. Counseling style had a significant effect on perception of counselor <b>job</b> <b>mastery,</b> counselor desire to help, willingness to see a counselor, and self disclosure about educational needs. Sex had a significant effect on the perception of the counselor as attractive. No significant effects were found for the dependent variables of expertness, counselor ability to help and self disclosure about money and personality. Results are discussed in terms of their implication for counseling Hispanic college students. Limitations and suggestions for further research are also presented. ...|$|E
40|$|The lack of {{emphasis}} on occupational literacy competencies in most public school reading curricula leaves stwients poorly prepared for {{the demands of the}} workplace. Most <b>jobs</b> require <b>mastery</b> of the following literacy competencies: technical vocabulary; locating and using information; following directions; and self- Monitoring of comprehension and performance during work tasks. While {{it is not possible to}} equip students for specific job settings, teachers ezan help students develop these literacy competencies by using such instructional techniques as semantic mapping, monologing, metacognition, and reciprocal teaching.

500|$|There are 34 [...] "jobs" [...] in Tactics Advance {{that govern}} a character's stats, equipment, and abilities. Most items {{that can be}} {{equipped}} have various abilities assigned to them, each available for use by characters of a certain job while the item is equipped. When a battle is completed, characters will receive Ability Points (AP) distributed over their currently equipped weapons or items (such as armor). Once a target amount of AP has been accumulated for a given ability, the character will master that ability, allowing the character to use them at any time, regardless of items equipped and <b>job</b> chosen. <b>Mastery</b> of abilities in different jobs will eventually allow the character access to more jobs. For example, if a human unit wishes to change jobs to Paladin, it needs to master at least two [...] "action" [...] abilities from the Soldier job.|$|R
40|$|Sufficient {{recovery}} after daily effort expenditure at work {{is important}} to protect employee health and well-being. However, the role of commuting in the daily effort-recovery process is still not very well understood. The present study aimed to advance insight in this respect by examining if relaxation, detachment, mastery and stressful delays experienced during the commute from work to home affect employees' recovery status after returning {{home from work and}} at the end of the evening. Daily job demands were expected to moderate these effects. Serenity and (low) anxiety were included as indicators of employees' recovery status. Data were collected by means of a 5 -day daily diary study (three measurements daily) among 76 participants from various industries. Multilevel analyses showed that relaxation was positively and stressful delays were negatively related to employees' recovery status after returning home from work but not to indicators of recovery at the end of the evening. For detachment, similar relations were found but only on days with high <b>job</b> demands. <b>Mastery</b> was not related to employees' recovery status. These findings enhance our insight in the daily effort-recovery cycle and underline the importance of promoting detachment (on demanding workdays) and relaxation on the way home from work...|$|R
40|$|Machine Translation {{has been}} {{chosen as the}} subject of this thesis because of the {{increasing}} importance and demand for it. Due to more advanced techniques, the availability of computers and even the internet, many people can enjoy the advantages of (online) translation programs. Since the boundaries between countries have opened and we are living in a society where the knowledge of at least one foreign language is indispensable, the need for machine translation has become greater. The use of different languages (mainly English) is important not just in the business world or among diplomats but for common people as well. Getting a good <b>job</b> without the <b>mastery</b> of one or two languages (in most cases English is required) is now almost impossible. In order to understand computer programs, operating instructions or just simple articles on the web {{we need to have a}} good command of English or another language in addition to Hungarian. For those who lack foreign language skills, translation programs namely the so called machine translation can help. egyetemiangol nyelv és irodalo...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Teachers’ burnout {{affects the}} {{learning}} process and students’ achievement and reduces job satisfaction. Physical education (PE) teachers represent a group {{at greater risk of}} burnout, in whom psychological and environmental aspects, such as not having appropriate school equipment and facilities, can represent risk factors. This cross-sectional study aimed to analyse the direct and the mediated effects of a range of psychological and environmental aspects as determinants of burnout and job satisfaction in PE teachers. Methods: One hundred and eighty-three PE teachers participated in the study. They filled out a booklet of questionnaires to assess self-efficacy, enjoyment of physical activty, <b>job</b> satisfaction, burnout, <b>mastery</b> and performance goals, and the perceived quality of school facilities. Results: Correlation analyses showed negative relationships between burnout dimensions and job satisfaction. Burnout mediated the relationships between mastery goals, self-efficacy, enjoyment, and job satisfaction, while the perceived quality of school facilities had just a direct effect on burnout. Conclusions: In order to increase job satisfaction and decrease burnout in PE teachers it seems more effective to act mainly on psychological factors rather than on providing better facilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of mastery and performance goal orientations. It sought to determine what the relationship is between a student 2 ̆ 7 s perception of goal orientation and other key learning and personality variables such as learning strategy use, task challenge preference, attitude towards class, self-perception of ability, and causal attributions in classroom settings populated by at-risk students in Lincoln, Nebraska. ^ Data for the study were obtained through a survey administered to at-risk sophomores enrolled in thirteen sections of adjusted English. The 54 items on the survey were grouped into six sections: goal orientation, learning strategy use, task challenge preference, attitude towards class, perception of ability, and causal attributes for success and failure. One hundred and fifty-four, or 66 percent, of the at-risk students enrolled in adjusted English completed the survey. ^ At-risk students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the classroom learning environment were differentiated by mastery and performance goal orientations. Perceiving a mastery goal orientation was found to foster adaptive motivation behaviors. Mastery goal orientation was a more significant predictor of effective learning strategy use, a positive attitude towards class, and choosing challenging tasks that resulted in new learning. ^ Students perceiving mastery goal orientations believed that their successes covaried with the expenditure of effort, good strategy use, and the teacher doing a good <b>job.</b> Both <b>mastery</b> and performance goal orientations were found to foster causal attributes for failure. ^ Self-perceived ability was found to be a significant predictor of learning strategy use, attitude towards class, and task challenge preference. Further analysis revealed that mastery goal orientation exceeded ability as a predictor. ^ Study findings support the importance of creating classroom learning environments based on the salience of mastery goal orientation. Specific recommendations for further research of goal orientation and future structuring of classrooms were presented. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{whether a}} high cortisol awakening response (CAR) and low cortisol decline over the day (CDD) {{are related to}} self-reported work stress and well-being, and whether there are gender differences in these relationships. Three hundred eighty-three {{working men and women}} responded to a survey measuring <b>job</b> stress factors, <b>mastery</b> at work, symptoms and well-being. Salivary cortisol was sampled at awakening, after 45 min and at 21 : 00, from which the variables CAR and CDD were defined. A high CAR was associated with lower perceived job control and work mastery, and poorer well-being. Low CDD was associated only with higher job demands, but the self-report scores showed a number of interactions between cortisol group and gender. Among women, those showing a low CDD, compared with those with a higher CDD, had more favourable scores on a number of job stress factors and symptom load. In contrast, among men, a similar comparison showed those with low CDD to have poorer scores on job stress factors and symptom load. We conclude that individuals displaying high CAR or low CDD differ from those not displaying these cortisol profiles in self-report of work stress and well-being, and that gender differences appear in these relationships...|$|R
40|$|Background: The leader role in {{the health}} service has been {{changing}} a lot during the last years. From taking part in patient care, the leaders are now responsible for finance, systems, human resources and administration. New management thinking (NPM) has emerged and this together with change in legislation (NOU 1997 : 2) has influenced how the leaders perform their jobs. To manage the role as leader it is needed competences and skills. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how many of the nurse leaders had further formel education in leadership and how this education influence the feeling of mastery and satisfaction. The hypotheses are that leaders with management education master their job better and are more satisfied then those who have no further education. Material: The respondents are midlevel nurse leaders in a hospital. 145 questionnaires were sent to leaders at somatic units (98) and to leaders at psychiatrics units (47). 100 questionnaires were included in the study and the response rate was 69 %. Method: The study is a survey with a questionnaire in four parts. Part one and four contain demographic variables. ”General Self-Efficacy Scale” and ”Mastery scale” were used to measure degree of mastery. ”Job Satisfaction Questionnaire” was used to measure degree of job satisfaction. Results: More than half of the respondents, (61, 6 %) have further education in leadership. Leaders with further education feel greater mastery than they without (p< 0. 05), but there are no significant differences in satisfaction. Numbers of year (experience) as leader show no positive relation to mastery and satisfaction. Leaders who had not considered to quit their <b>job</b> feel greater <b>mastery</b> (p< 0. 05) and satisfaction (p< 0. 05) than those who had considered to quit. Between gender there are no significant differences in perception of mastery, but women are more satisfied with their job than men (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Leadership education among nurse leaders seems to give an increased feeling of mastery, but not an increased feeling of job satisfaction...|$|R
