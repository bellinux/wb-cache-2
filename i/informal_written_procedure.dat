40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Second {{language}} writers often {{learn to}} write in English {{in the context of}} test-oriented instruction and lack experience with writing that focuses on the expression of their thoughts. This limited writing experience forms a concept of writing in English as a product, which lowers second language writers' motivation to engage in English writing and inhibits their growth as competent writers. This qualitative case study provides insights into how Asian adult second language writers engage in <b>informal</b> <b>writing</b> as part of a writing workshop. Participants of this study include 13 adult second language writers coming from Korea, China, and Thailand. The participants wrote for a set amount of time, twice a week during a seven-week writing workshop. As a part of the case study approach, the qualitative data included interviews, surveys, observational notes, and participants' <b>informal</b> <b>writing</b> samples. The results indicated three findings: second language writers discovered benefits of <b>informal</b> writing; their <b>writing</b> developed without direct grammar instruction; and they improved their attitude and confidence toward writing in English. Participants showed their range of language use, their sense of audience, fluency, and self-monitoring when they engaged in <b>informal</b> <b>writing.</b> This study suggests several implications for teachers of writing, including the importance of utilizing <b>informal</b> <b>writing</b> as an instructional strategy; establishing <b>writing</b> routines for <b>informal</b> writing; and recognizing writers' range of thinking and language use in second language writing...|$|R

30|$|The {{presence}} of a <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> {{does not mean that}} physicians will follow it. We found that the {{presence of}} a <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> on sedation management did not reduce the practice variation. One of the underlying reasons might be the lack of knowledge of the <b>written</b> <b>procedure.</b> Indeed, we found that among ICUs self-reporting a protocol for sedation management, approximately 20 % of the physicians were unaware of it. Hence, the presence of <b>written</b> <b>procedures</b> does not mean that there is an ICU culture promoting the benefits of <b>written</b> <b>procedures</b> to reduce practice variation within participating ICUs. Sinuff et al. showed in a multicenter qualitative study that the {{presence of a}} culture of guidelines within the ICU is key to facilitate clinicians’ adherence to guidelines [19]. Another explanation may be that <b>written</b> <b>procedures</b> apply poorly to complex situations and are rapidly judged useless when addressing complex issues.|$|R

5000|$|The Japanese {{full stop}} (。) and comma (、) {{are used for}} similar {{purposes}} to their English equivalents, though comma usage can be more fluid than {{is the case in}} English. The question mark (？) is not used in traditional or formal Japanese, but it may be used in <b>informal</b> <b>writing,</b> or in transcriptions of dialogue where it might not otherwise be clear that a statement was intoned as a question. The exclamation mark (！) is restricted to <b>informal</b> <b>writing.</b> Colons and semicolons are available but are not common in ordinary text. Quotation marks are written as 「 ... 」, and nested quotation marks as 『 ... 』. Several bracket styles and dashes are available.|$|R

5000|$|Research by Rosen et al. (2009) {{found that}} those young adults who used more language-based textisms (shortcuts such as LOL, 2nite, etc.) in daily writing {{produced}} worse formal writing than those young adults who used fewer linguistic textisms in daily writing. However, the exact opposite was true for <b>informal</b> <b>writing.</b> This suggests that perhaps the act of using textisms to shorten communication words leads young adults to produce more <b>informal</b> <b>writing,</b> which may then help them to be better [...] "informal" [...] writers. Due to text messaging, teens are writing more, and some teachers see that this comfort with language can be harnessed to make better writers. This new form of communication may be encouraging students to put their thoughts and feelings into words {{and this may be}} able {{to be used as a}} bridge, to get them more interested in formal writing.|$|R
