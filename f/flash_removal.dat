40|$|This bracket {{transfer}} tray is so {{designed in}} such a way that the excess composite flash during indirect bracket bonding is pushed in the incisal and occlusal direction only so that it can easily be removed by rotary instruments. In lingual orthodontics, where accessing the gingival and interdental areas with rotary instruments is very difficult, this transfer tray system is helpful for easy <b>flash</b> <b>removal</b> and simple clinical maneuver. Additional silicon putty material is used to make this tray that has a palatal strip, a labial/bucal strip with incisal and occlusal stops and interbracket connectors...|$|E
40|$|Background: Newer {{available}} {{composite resin}} adhesives have chromatic agents that change their color during setting from pink to colorless. It has an advantage of easy <b>flash</b> <b>removal</b> thus {{reducing the amount}} of plaque accumulation and helping patients to maintain better hygiene. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare shear bond strengths of light-cure orthodontic bonding agents, namely glass ionomer (FujiOrthoLC, GC Orthodontics), conventional composite resin (Transbond XT, 3 M Unitek), and color-changing composite resin (Transbond Plus, 3 M Unitek) with conventional etch and self-etch primer (Transbond PlusSEP, 3 M Unitek). Materials and Methods: Maxillary premolars (n= 300) were bonded on the facial surface in five groups. The INSTRON machine was used for shear bond strength testing. Statistical Analysis: Comparison of the mean rank among the groups was done by Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). To determine the mean difference among groups, the Mann-Whitney test with Bon Ferroni adjustment was applied. Observations: It was observed that light-cure conventional composite resin with the conventional etchant group had the highest and glass ionomer resin adhesive had the lowest shear bond strength. There was no statistically significant difference between conventional composite used with conventional etchant and color-changing composite resin used with conventional etchant or with self-etch primer. Conclusion: Considering the advantages of a color-changing composite and self-etch primer especially in patients having high DMFT scores or physically and mentally compromised patients unable to maintain their hygiene properly, it was concluded in the present study that it would be the most suitable material for direct bonding...|$|E
40|$|Video {{segmentation}} is {{the first}} task in almost all video analysis applications. It consists in identifying {{the boundaries of the}} meaningful video units (shots). Without a doubt, cuts are the most common among production effects that characterize the shot boundaries. In this paper we propose an algorithm for cut detection exploiting an innovative, robust frame difference measure. The measure is based on a combination of different visual features. To improve the precision of the cut detection algorithm, a temporal pattern analysis model, and a <b>flashes</b> <b>removal</b> are also proposed. Experimental results to prove the effectiveness of the proposed measure coupled with the temporal pattern analysis model on very heterogeneous and complex sets of videos are critically reporte...|$|R

Reportedly conceived with the input from Herbert Keppler in 1987, the new Minolta patented design featured a push-button latching mechanism, {{for the purpose of}} easier and faster <b>flash</b> attachment and <b>removal</b> and a more secure hold.|$|R
40|$|Flash gas bypass {{represents}} one of the prospective approaches to improve the efficiency of various small scale heat transfer systems that utilize refrigerant as a working fluid. It is characterized by the bypass of vapor created throughout the expansion process around the evaporator. As the advantages of <b>flash</b> gas <b>removal</b> in R 744 systems are observed, it is of scientific interest to elaborate the same approach in R 134 a or similar low pressure refrigerant A/C systems. The main reason for this is the fact that lower pressure fluids are more affected by pressure drop, therefore <b>flash</b> gas <b>removal</b> which reduces low system side pressure drop will be more beneficial utilizing these fluids. This project developed a methodology for studying phase separation in compact vessels and analyzing their impact inR 134 a automotive A/C systems. The flash gas bypass concept would be attractive for commercial implementation if a compact separation vessel could efficiently separate refrigerant phases over wide ranges of flow conditions and the simple flow controlling device could be exploited in the flash gas bypass line. It would be convenient if the phase separation vessel could be implemented in the evaporator header. A methodic approach has been implemented analyzing T -junctions as a starting design, studying the mechanisms of phase separation and paving the way towards more advanced geometries. To our knowledge, the idea of implementing compact and efficient separation devices in the heat exchanger header is a unique approach that is not been studied elsewhere.. Two T-junctions with inlet tube diameters 8. 7 mm and 12 mm, with body diameters 18. 3 and 23. 8 mm respectively, are examined and analyzed at a range of mass flow rates and vapor qualities typically found in automotive A/C systems. The quantification of both vapor and liquid phase separation efficiencies has been defined. The 18. 3 mm body diameter T-junction could efficiently separate liquid up to 30 g/s and 20 % vapor quality, while the 23. 8 mm diameter flash tank could perform efficient phase separation up to 45 g/s and 15 % vapor quality. Based on the observed phase separation phenomena, separation enhancers could increase the separation efficiency. The impact on the A/C system level has been analyzed using a T-junction with 23. 8 mm body diameter. At matched capacities to the Baseline DX system, the Flash Gas Bypass system showed significant improvements in the system efficiency (COP), up to 55 %. The reason for such high improvement {{lies in the fact that}} the evaporator was slightly undersized when compared to the rest of the A/C system components. A needle valve was utilized to control the flash gas bypass flow. The flash gas bypass valve opening had a significant effect on system performance., The system had the highest improvement in COP with the flash gas bypass valve opened ?? turn (valve flow coefficient approximately 0. 25), when compared to the Baseline DX configuration at matched capacity. This shows the prospect of implementing a simple regulating device such as an orifice tube...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background This paper {{presents}} and tests a comprehensive computerised system of analysis of digital images of posterior capsule opacification (PCO). It updates and expands significantly {{on a previous}} presentation to include facilities for selecting user defined central areas and for registering and subsequent merging of images for artefact removal. Also, the program is compiled and thus {{eliminates the need for}} specialised additional software. The system is referred to in this paper as the open-access systematic capsule assessment (OSCA). The system is designed to be evidence based, objective and openly available, improving on current systems of analysis. Methods Principal features of the OSCA system of analysis are discussed. Flash artefacts are automatically located in two PCO images and the images merged to produce a composite free from these artefacts. For this to be possible the second image has to be manipulated with a registration technique to bring it into alignment with the first. Further image processing and analysis steps use a location-sensitive entropy based texture analysis of PCO. Validity of measuring PCO progression of the whole new system is assessed along with visual significance of scores. Reliability of the system is assessed. Results Analysis of PCO by the system shows ability to detect early progression of PCO, as well as detection of more visually significant PCO. Images with no clinical PCO produce very low scores in the analysis. Reliability of the system of analysis is demonstrated. Conclusion This system of PCO analysis is evidence-based, objective and clinically useful. It incorporates <b>flash</b> detection and <b>removal</b> as well as location sensitive texture analysis. It provides features and benefits not previously available to most researchers or clinicians. Substantial evidence is provided for this system's validity and reliability. </p...|$|R
