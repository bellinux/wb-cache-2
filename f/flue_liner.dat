25|$|A <b>flue</b> <b>liner</b> is a {{secondary}} barrier in a chimney {{that protects the}} masonry from the acidic products of combustion, helps prevent flue gas from entering the house, and reduces {{the size of an}} oversized flue. Newly built chimneys have been required by building codes to have a <b>flue</b> <b>liner</b> in many locations since the 1950s. Chimneys built without a liner can usually have a liner added, but the type of liner needs to match the type of appliance it is servicing. Flue liners may be clay tile, metal, concrete tiles, or poured in place concrete.|$|E
50|$|Other {{features}} {{included a}} chimney stack {{in close proximity}} to the main structure, towards the southern end. Built of brick, the chimney also had a corbelled necking and a tapered <b>flue</b> <b>liner.</b> There are two double-hung windows. There was also a well house with a hipped roof towards the rear.|$|E
25|$|Concrete <b>flue</b> <b>liners</b> {{are like}} clay liners but {{are made of}} a {{refractory}} cement and are more durable than the clay liners.|$|R
50|$|Fired clay bricks {{have been}} used {{since the time of}} the Romans. Special tiles are used for roofing, siding, flooring, ceilings, pipes, <b>flue</b> <b>liners,</b> and more.|$|R
50|$|A {{chimney fire}} is the {{combustion}} (burning) of residue deposits {{referred to as}} soot or creosote, on the inner surfaces of chimney tiles, <b>flue</b> <b>liners,</b> stove pipes, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Uniclass 2015 is {{a unified}} {{classification}} system for {{all sectors of}} the UK construction industry. It contains consistent tables classifying items of all scales, from facilities such as a railway to products like anchor plates, <b>flue</b> <b>liners</b> or LED lamps.|$|R
2500|$|Clay tile <b>flue</b> <b>liners</b> {{are very}} common in the United States. However, {{this is the only}} liner which does not meet Underwriters Laboratories 1777 {{approval}} and frequently have problems such as cracked tiles and improper installation. Clay tiles are usually about [...] long, various sizes and shapes, and are installed in new construction as the chimney is built. A refractory cement is used between each tile.|$|R
50|$|Graff-Kittanning Clay Products Company was {{incorporated}} in 1924, and construction was begun at the Craigsville site in that year. In 1925 production was started and has continued without interruption until the present date. In 1945 the Worthington Ceramics Division was acquired as a totally-owned subsidiary and {{was put into}} production shortly thereafter. In 1958, the Logan Clay Products Company of Logan, Ohio, purchased the Graff Kittanning Clay Products Company, and from that date on it {{was known as the}} Graff-Kittanning Division of the Logan Clay Products Company. R. M. Graff was president of Graff-Kittanning from the time of its incorporation until it was purchased by the Logan Clay Products Company. He was also General Manager of the operations from 1924 until his death in 1963. The following products are manufactured at the Craigsville plant: vitrified clay sewer pipe, clay <b>flue</b> <b>liners,</b> wall coping, and factory made joints. At the Worthington Ceramics Plant, clay building tile, drain tile, and flue lining are manufactured. A total of approximately two hundred people were employed at both operations, approximately one hundred fifty at the Graff-Kittanning Plant and fifty at Worthington Ceramics Plant. The products manufactured in both plants was distributed in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.|$|R
40|$|The {{brick and}} {{structural}} clay products industry {{is made up}} primarily of facilities that manufacture structural brick from clay, shale, {{or a combination of}} the two. These facilities are classified under standard industrial classification (SIC) code 3251, brick and structural clay tile. Facilities that manufacture structural clay products, such as clay pipe, adobe brick, chimney pipe, <b>flue</b> <b>liners,</b> drain tiles, roofing tiles, and sewer tiles are classified under SIC code 3259, structural clay products, not elsewhere classified. 11. 3. 2 Process Description 3 - 6 The manufacture of brick and structural clay products involves mining, grinding, screening and blending of the raw materials followed by forming, cutting or shaping, drying, firing, cooling, storage, and shipping of the final product. A typical brick manufacturing process is shown in Figure 11. 3 - 1. The raw materials used in the manufacture of brick and structural clay products include surface clays and shales, which are mined in open pits. The moisture content of the raw materials ranges from a low of about 3 percent at some plants to a high of about 15 percent at other plants. Some facilities have onsite mining operations, while others bring in raw material by truck or rail. The raw material is typically loaded by truck or front-end loader into a primary crusher for initial size reduction. The material is then conveyed to a grinding room, which houses several grinding mills and banks of screens that produce a fine material that i...|$|R
