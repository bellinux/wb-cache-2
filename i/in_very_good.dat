On August 7, 2015, they tried again and recovered the bell <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> condition. It was further restored and put on display in May 2016 in the National Museum of the Royal Navy in remembrance to the 1,415 men lost at sea.|$|E

The ship is preserved <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> condition, with side-scan sonar picking up even the deck planking. The wreck {{lies at the}} bottom of the eastern portion of Queen Maud Gulf, west of O'Reilly Island. On 1 October at the House of Commons, Prime Minister Stephen Harper confirmed that the wreck is indeed HMS Erebus.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} ghost {{stations}} on the Buenos Aires Underground, two on Line A and two on Line E. The Line A stations – Pasco Sur and Alberti Norte – were closed in 1953 since stations {{in that part}} of the line were grouped very closely together and having fewer stops would improve the line's frequency. Pasco Sur remains <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> condition, while Alberti Norte was converted into an electrical substation.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{priorities}} of the regeneration was {{the restoration of the}} dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced & bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired. The Albert Dock company appointed Tarmac to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage. Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of Hartley's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, eight German-built Orjen-class MTBs were added. Also in 1936, a new naval coastal command was {{established}} {{under the command}} of a rear admiral. It was headquartered in Split, and included shore-based commands at Selce, Šibenik and Đenovići. By the end of that year, the KJRM consisted of 27 surface combatants, four submarines, and around a dozen auxiliary vessels, crewed by a total of 487 officers and about 5,000 men. The yacht Lada had been disposed of, as had the minesweeper D2. The training ship Sitnica had been converted into a second submarine depot ship, and the Galeb-class mine tenders had been reclassified as minelayers. The river flotilla consisted of the four monitors, the royal yacht Dragor, two patrol boats—Graničar and Stražar, and three river tugs; Cer, Triglav and Avala. However, in 1936 the only vessels ready for war service were Dubrovnik and the four submarines, and the navy was only considered capable of patrol duties and coastal surveillance, minelaying and minor raids against enemy shipping. Despite this, the United States naval attaché observed that the morale and discipline of the navy was very good. He further stated that higher-level commanders appeared discouraged at the poor position of the navy due to its inadequate budget. He concluded that the fleet was <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> condition considering its funding. During 1936, Nebojša and Osvetnik visited Corfu, and Zmaj and three Galeb-class mine tenders also visited Corfu.|$|E

25|$|During {{the advance}} from {{southern}} Palestine {{the system of}} leave to the Australian Mounted Division's Rest Camp at Port Said was stopped. It started again in January 1918, and throughout the occupation of the Jordan Valley quotas averaging about 350 men were sent there every ten days.

25|$|The Piraeus Athena was {{discovered}} in 1959, by workers who were drilling underground to install pipes. Bronze was first hit 1.5 meters below the ground; a few days later, they uncovered the statue {{at the intersection of}} Georgiou I Street and Philonos Street. The excavation of the statue was led by Efthymios Mastrokostas. The Piraeus Athena was found with three more large bronze statues, along with other artifacts. The Piraeus Athena {{was discovered}} <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> condition; however, it underwent irreparable damage after being abandoned on the damp floor of the Piraeus Museum according to the scholar, Steinhauer.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{dismantling}} began, TCRT had purchased {{a significant number}} of PCC streetcars. These were sold off in 1952 and 1953, still <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> operating condition. The cars ended up in Mexico City (91 cars), Newark, New Jersey (30) and Shaker Heights, Ohio (20). Relatively few places could have taken them because of their extra width and each of these buyers had significant amounts of dedicated right-of-way. For instance, the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit commuter line in Cleveland was grade-separated in many areas. The vast majority of the older wooden streetcars, mostly built by TCRT itself, were destroyed. Out of 1240 built by the company, only five have survived to be restored and operated by rail museums.|$|E
