40|$|Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV) {{has lost}} about 80 % {{bottomland}} hardwood forests, mainly to agriculture. This landscape scale alteration of the LMV {{resulted in the}} loss of nitrate (NO 3) removal capacity of the valley, contributing to nitrogen (N) -enhanced eutrophication and potentially hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Restoration of hardwood forests in the LMV is a highly recommended practice to reduce NO 3 load of the Mississippi River. However, restored bottomland forests take decades to develop characteristic ecological functions including denitrifier activity. One way to enhance denitrifier activity in restored wetland forests is to amend the soils with an available carbon (C) source. This research investigated the effects of cotton gin trash (CGT) amendment on denitrification rate and N 2 O:N 2 emission ratio from a restored bottomland <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> and compared it to those from an adjacent unamended natural <b>forest</b> <b>soils.</b> CGT amendment increased denitrification rates in the restored <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> {{to the level of the}} natural <b>forest</b> <b>soils.</b> N 2 O:N 2 emission ratios from the restored and natural <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> were highly variable and were not significantly different from each other.
