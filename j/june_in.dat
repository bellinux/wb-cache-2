5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} bulb fly Merodon equestris, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus.

The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common swift moth) attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|E
