5|$|As part of {{the bicentennial}} celebration of the battle, in 2015 Belgium minted a 2 <b>Euro</b> <b>coin</b> {{depicting}} the Lion monument over {{a map of the}} field of battle. France officially protested this issue, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo. After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2½ Euros. Legally only valid within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 Euros. A 10 <b>Euro</b> <b>coin,</b> showing Wellington, Blücher, their troops and the silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 Euros.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo was, and is, renowned {{primarily}} as a painter. Among his works, the Mona Lisa is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items {{as varied as the}} <b>euro</b> <b>coin,</b> textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived. Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.|$|E

500|$|Despite Homer's {{embodiment}} of American culture, his influence {{has spread to}} other parts of the world. In 2003, Matt Groening revealed that his father, after whom Homer was named, was Canadian, and said that this made Homer himself a Canadian. The character was later made an honorary citizen of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, because Homer Groening was believed to be from there, although sources say the senior Groening was actually born in the province of Saskatchewan. In 2007, an image of Homer was painted next to the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset, England as part of a promotion for The Simpsons Movie. This caused outrage among local neopagans who performed [...] "rain magic" [...] to try to get it washed away. In 2008, a defaced Spanish <b>euro</b> <b>coin</b> was found in Avilés, Spain with the face of Homer replacing the effigy of King Juan Carlos I.|$|E
500|$|The 5th century BC Athenian tetradrachm ("four drachmae") coin {{was perhaps}} the most widely used coin in the Greek world before the time of Alexander the Great (along with the Corinthian stater). It {{featured}} the helmeted profile bust of Athena on the obverse (front) and an owl on the reverse (back). In daily use they were called [...] glaukes (owls), hence the proverb , 'an owl to Athens', referring to something that was in plentiful supply, like 'coals to Newcastle'. The reverse is featured on the national side of the modern Greek 1 <b>euro</b> <b>coin.</b> Drachmae were minted on different weight standards at different Greek mints. The standard that came to be most commonly used was the Athenian or Attic one, which weighed a little over 4.3grams. A drachma was approximately a day's pay for a skilled laborer. [...] So 30 pieces of silver (30 tetradrachm), at four drachmas each, [...] would roughly be comparable to four months' (120 days) wages.|$|E
