2500|$|Possibly the {{earliest}} important example over an altar {{was in the}} Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome, also donated by Constantine, looted by the Visigoths in the 5th century and now replaced by a large Gothic structure (see below).

6000|$|It is very {{difficult}} to translate this; for <b>fastigium,</b> besides its general sense, has a particular one in architecture, and refers to the part of the building occupied by the bust; but the main meaning of it is that [...] "Vincenzo Fini fills all height with his virtue." [...] The inscription goes on into farther praise, but this example is enough. Over the two lateral doors are two other laudatory inscriptions of younger members of the Fini family, the dates of death of the three heroes being 1660, 1685, and 1726, marking thus the period of consummate degradation.|$|E

50|$|It is {{relatively}} easy to distinguish P. specularis from the other three species, because only in this species is the distal spine of the fore femur directed anteriorly. Also, the <b>fastigium</b> frontis is tubercular and obtuse in this species, where it is spiniform and acute in the other three species. Another distinguishing feature {{is that there is a}} small tubercle or nodule on the medioventral portion of the scape (the first or basal segment) of the antenna of P. specularis, in contrast to the erect distal spine in this location in the other three species. Finally, the dorsal surface of the femora are unarmed (lacking in spines) in this species, whereas the other three species possess spines at this location.|$|E

5000|$|Orphulella speciosa {{has a very}} slanted face. The {{margins of}} the vertex of the head (the top of the head, located between the eyes) are less raised. The foveola (a small dent in the integument) is not distinct. The pronotal disks are found {{at the top of}} the first {{thoracic}} segment and are almost equivalent in width in the front and back. The principal sulcus on the pronotum, which is a ridge that cuts the middle of the outer integument, [...] cuts the prenatal disk a little past the middle. The tegmina (the leathery, slender forewings extend to the end of the hind femora, and curve in towards the apex. The males' hind femora often vary in size from 1.5 mm to 3mm from the end of the femora. O. speciosa are sexually dimorphic; the females are much larger than the males. Female body sizes range from 16-21.5 mm with antennae that are 5-6mm long, tegmina that are 9-16mm long, and hind femora that are 9.5-12 mm long. Males range from 13-14mm in total length with antennae 4.5-6.5mm in length, tegmina, 101-13 mm in length, and hind femora are 8.5-10 mm in length. On lower end of the lateral lobes (the vertical sides of the pronotum of the males, there is a pale curved line. O. speciosa individuals exhibit much variation in color, especially combinations of green and brown. Females are often light green with a dark coloration on the vertex of the head. Females are occasionally brown and have a line on the sides of the pronotum. O. speciosa looks very similar to a related species in the same genus, O. pelidna. These two species can be identified from one another by looking at the <b>fastigium</b> (the part of the head that is located in between the eyes of the grasshoppers and their size. O.speciosa has a small median ridge on the <b>fastigium</b> and is much smaller than O. pelidna. O. pelidna has a semicircular indentation that is set farther back than on O. speciosa, and O. pelidna has a lateral carinae that is incised twice.|$|E
