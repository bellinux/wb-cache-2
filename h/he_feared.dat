5|$|Karmal was {{recalled}} from Czechoslovakia {{but rather}} than returning to Afghanistan he went into hiding with Anahita Ratebzad, his friend and former Afghan ambassador to Yugoslavia, as <b>he</b> <b>feared</b> execution if he returned. Muhammad Najibullah followed them. Taraki consequently stripped them of all official titles and political authority.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{entered the}} fray yet again with this mobile guard. <b>He</b> <b>feared</b> a general {{attack on a}} broad front which he wouldn't be able to repulse and as a {{precaution}} ordered Abu Ubaidah and Yazid on the left centre and the left wings respectively to attack the Byzantine armies at the respective fronts. The attack would result in stalling the Byzantine front and prevent a general advance of the Imperial army.|$|E

For me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he returns." ...|$|R

5|$|Newton {{had been}} {{reluctant}} to publish his calculus because <b>he</b> <b>feared</b> controversy and criticism. He {{was close to the}} Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier. In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of Newton's Principia, and corresponded with Leibniz. In 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.|$|E
5|$|Though Stanley and Black won the election, {{they never}} became {{political}} allies. At {{the time of}} their election and service, the Kentucky Constitution prescribed that the lieutenant governor would act as governor any time the governor left the state. Consequently, Stanley refused to travel out of state on vacation because <b>he</b> <b>feared</b> he would not approve of anyone Black would appoint to any unfilled governmental offices while he was gone.|$|E
5|$|While in Williamsburg, Timberlake and Ostenaco {{attended}} {{a dinner party}} at William & Mary College; that evening Ostenaco {{said he would like}} to meet the king of England. Although <b>he</b> <b>feared</b> the trip would break him financially, Timberlake agreed to arrange such a trip and meeting for him. In May 1762, Timberlake, Sumter, and three distinguished Cherokee leaders, including Ostenaco, departed for London.|$|E
5000|$|In the Apology, Plato's Socrates {{argues that}} <b>he</b> <b>fears</b> {{committing}} injustice more than <b>he</b> <b>fears</b> death. In support of that claim, he cites two incidents in which he, at great personal risk, disobeyed unjust commands of the Athenian government. One of those orders {{was for him}} to arrest Leon of Salamis and bring him to the Thirty for execution: ...|$|R

5|$|Wilson {{initially}} favoured relatively lenient {{treatment of}} Germany – <b>he</b> <b>feared</b> too harsh conditions could foment {{the rise of}} extremism, and wanted Germany to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports. To Keynes's dismay, Lloyd George and Clemenceau were able to pressure Wilson to agree to include pensions in the reparations bill.|$|E
5|$|A merchant, José Ignacio Rezábal, {{attended}} the open cabildo but, {{in a letter}} to the priest Julián S. de Agüero, said that he had some doubts which were shared by other people close to him. <b>He</b> <b>feared</b> that, no matter which party prevailed in the open cabildo, it would take revenge against the other, the Mutiny of Álzaga being a recent precedent. He felt that the open cabildo would lack legitimacy if too many criollos were allowed to take part in it as a result of the aforementioned manipulation of the guest list.|$|E
5|$|Although other retired {{high-ranking}} officers, including generals James Gavin and Matthew Ridgway, joined Shoup in this, it was Shoup's pointed criticisms {{that regularly}} made {{the front pages}} of newspapers, because they went beyond the war to American government, business, and military leadership. <b>He</b> <b>feared</b> the conflict had endangered the nation's historical identity, and argued increasing the troop levels in Vietnam would only aggravate the strategic problems there. Historian Robert Buzzanco noted that Shoup may have been the most vocal former military member to oppose the war.|$|E

If this could be found I believe that he would sign the draft treaty." ...|$|R
5|$|Another {{factor in}} Wallace's {{thinking}} was his belief that, {{because of the}} action of natural selection, organisms were {{in a state of}} balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; <b>he</b> <b>feared</b> vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results. Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{himself said}} {{that he did not want}} such a large number of Ulstermen, as he had saved the grain harvest himself, and that only ten or fifteen labourers were needed to save the root crops. <b>He</b> <b>feared</b> that a large number of Ulstermen would lead to sectarian violence. While local Land League leaders said that there would be no trouble from them if the aim was simply to harvest the crops, more extreme {{sections}} of the local population did threaten violence against the expedition and the troops.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters {{had been}} {{drafted into the}} United States Armed Forces for World War II. The {{resulting}} difficulty in fielding a full-strength squad led some owners to recommend the league should shut down until the war ended. Bell auspiciously argued against this as <b>he</b> <b>feared</b> {{they might not be}} able to resume operations easily after the war, and since Major League Baseball was continuing unabated, then they should also.|$|E
5000|$|He never blames anyone, {{states the}} Upanishad, neither praises nor criticizes anyone, {{he is free}} of deceit and arrogance, he has no hate or love for anyone, he neither gets angry nor excited by anything, he just eats if he finds {{something}} and goes hungry if he does not, asserts the Upanishad. There is no superior or inferior for such a liberated man, states the text, he sees everything as nondual, he understands and lives by the divine secret and ancient value that [...] "there is no one else different from me". <b>He</b> <b>fears</b> no one, <b>he</b> <b>fears</b> no pain, <b>he</b> <b>fears</b> no pleasure, <b>he</b> has no longing for love, he is at rest in his innermost core, states the Upanishad.|$|R

50|$|In S v Jackson, an {{important}} case in South African criminal law, the Appellate Division {{held that a}} person is justified in killing in self-defence not only when <b>he</b> <b>fears</b> that his life is in danger but also when <b>he</b> <b>fears</b> grievous bodily harm. PE Linde appeared for the appellant and BG van der Walt, SC, Attorney-General OFS, for the State. The case was heard on March 8, 1963. The appellant's attorney was DA Carroll, Johannesburg.|$|R
5|$|Chaplin's {{loneliness}} {{was relieved}} when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a successful relationship. He {{was not ready to}} commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and <b>he</b> <b>feared</b> that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.|$|E
5|$|Jane's {{reported}} in 2002 that Iraqi intelligence had found classified documents {{in his home}} about a U.S. attack on Iraq. When they raided the house, fighting broke out between Abu Nidal's men and Iraqi intelligence. In the midst of this, Abu Nidal rushed into his bedroom and was killed; Palestinian sources told Jane's {{that he had been}} shot several times. Jane's suggested Saddam Hussein had him killed because <b>he</b> <b>feared</b> Abu Nidal would act against him {{in the event of an}} American invasion.|$|E
5|$|Major General Miles {{traveled}} {{aboard the}} USS Yale. While approaching the Mona Passage that separates Puerto Rico {{from the island}} of Hispaniola to the east, Miles opted to land his troops in the southern region of the island, choosing Guánica as his landing zone. Miles dispatched patrol boats to notify all other convoys of his decision and to order them to proceed to Guanica. Miles' decision to change the invasion site was based on his belief that the town of Fajardo would be fortified and <b>he</b> <b>feared</b> that Spanish coastal gun boats would disrupt a landing at Fajardo.|$|E

5|$|Mose Wright {{stayed on}} his front porch for twenty minutes waiting for Till to return. He did {{not go back to}} bed. He and another man went into Money, got gasoline, and drove around trying to find Till. Unsuccessful, they {{returned}} home by 8:00am. After hearing from Wright that he would not call the police because <b>he</b> <b>feared</b> for his life, Curtis Jones placed a call to the Leflore County sheriff, and another to his mother in Chicago. Distraught, she called Emmett's mother Mamie Till Bradley. Wright and his wife Elizabeth drove to Sumner, where Elizabeth's brother contacted the sheriff.|$|E
5|$|Shiina, {{given name}} unknown, {{otherwise}} {{referred to by}} his nickname , is another adult friend of Shuichi and Yoshino. He was Yuki's classmate in elementary school, and he eventually became her boyfriend after her transition. Unlike Yuki, Shiina had many friends in school. He generally just watches over Shuichi and Yoshino with Yuki, but he sometimes does bold and unexpected things, such as grabbing Yoshino's crotch when he first meets Yoshino because <b>he</b> <b>feared</b> that, because Yoshino was dressed as a boy at the time, Yuki might be having an illicit affair with Yoshino.|$|E
5|$|The Darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and Annie's {{death at}} the age of ten had a devastating effect on her parents. Charles was a devoted father and uncommonly {{attentive}} to his children. Whenever they fell ill, <b>he</b> <b>feared</b> that they might have inherited weaknesses from inbreeding due to the close family ties he shared with his wife and cousin, Emma Wedgwood. He examined this topic in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of crossing amongst many organisms. Despite his fears, most of the surviving children and many of their descendants went on to have distinguished careers (see Darwin-Wedgwood family).|$|E
