5|$|Allen's cricket {{remained}} {{limited in}} 1931. Despite all-round success in several early games for Middlesex, he was initially {{omitted from the}} team for the first Test against the New Zealand team. When Larwood withdrew with an ankle injury, Allen {{was added to the}} team; according to Anthony Meredith, writing in The Cricketer in 2002, Pelham Warner made this decision himself without consulting his fellow selectors, to their considerable annoyance. Allen did not have a particularly good match as a bowler, but was successful with the bat. When he started his innings {{at the beginning of the}} second day, England had scored 190 for seven wickets in reply to New Zealand's 224. He scored 98 in the 150-minute first session, and went on to score 122; with Les Ames, he added 246 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> wicket. This was a record partnership in Test matches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> wicket until 1996, and an England record for that wicket until 2010. England scored 454, but New Zealand replied with 469 and the match was drawn on the third and final day. This was Allen's only innings of the series.|$|E
