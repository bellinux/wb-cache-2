40|$|AbstractThe {{finite element}} mesh regeneration, which is usually {{required}} during the design model verification process, is time consuming. Mesh editing {{is a kind of}} efficient mesh regeneration technique. In this paper, a direct editing method for hexahedral mesh is proposed to achieve high quality and adaptive hexahedral mesh regeneration. After the user applies direct editing on the CAD model, effective mesh deformation and optimization are automatically conducted on the associated hexahedral mesh model. To optimize the deformed mesh, firstly, simplified fundamental sheet configuration conversions are applied to improve the boundary mesh quality; secondly, <b>dual</b> <b>operations</b> are carried out to insert/extract entire sheets; thirdly, according to the measurement of the hexahedron deformation, those mesh regions whose mesh sizes become not reasonable due to the deformation are coarsened and refined through localized <b>dual</b> <b>operations.</b> The proposed method can not only effectively achieve hexahedral mesh editing, but also facilitate the interoperation of CAD model and mesh model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{review the}} uplink/downlink duality between decision-feedback {{equalization}} (DFE) and (nonlinear) precoding at the transmitter side. Thereby {{the effect of}} bias compensation in DFE is addressed, and its connection {{to the concept of}} “inflated lattice precoding ” (ILP) —a tool which has been proven to be the key to achieve the capacity of channels with interference known at the transmitter—is elucidated. Concentrating on signal-to-interference plus noise ratios and hence error rates, pairs of schemes dual to each other are identified. It is shown that bias compensation in DFE and the scaling in ILP are <b>dual</b> <b>operations</b> and cancel each other. I...|$|R

50|$|The {{complications}} and difficulties outlined illustrate {{the benefits of}} standardised railway gauges, where possible.

During {{the period of}} <b>dual</b> <b>operation</b> with both old and new trains, the stock has its performance capped to match that of the older trains in order to comply with signalling constraints and avoid bunching of the service.

50|$|The <b>dual</b> <b>operation,</b> {{which began}} with much fanfare and leverage, proved to be too costly for Mugar and company.

With channel 7's news ratings in third place, minimal help from CBS (which had been in a ratings slump since the end of the 1987-88 television season) and declining profits, Mugar was eventually prompted to sell the WHDH stations. The radio station was sold to Atlantic Ventures in 1992.|$|E
