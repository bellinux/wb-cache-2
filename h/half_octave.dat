50|$|It is a mezzo-soprano, {{somewhat}} {{similar to that}} of Madame Vestris, but clearer, more powerful, and of greater compass. She commands two octaves, but two or three of the highest notes of this range are forced, and not agreeable. Her middle tones are fine and full-bodied; but, occasionally, notes escape in the lowest <b>half</b> <b>octave,</b> which are husky and harsh. In point of cultivation and science, she possesses, first of all, the rare merit of a pure intonation. We have not heard her once out of tune.|$|E

5000|$|The dangjeok {{is a small}} {{transverse}} bamboo flute used {{in traditional}} Korean music. Slightly smaller than its close instrument relative, the junggeum, the dangjoek is of Chinese origin. Its name, derived from the Chinese Tang Dynasty, dangjeok translates to [...] "Tang transverse bamboo flute." [...] The dangjeok is an aerophone which gives off a clear and bright sound, and has a limited one and a <b>half</b> <b>octave</b> range according to the ancient Korean music treatise, the akhakgwebeom. It is often played accompanied by the Korean lute and xylophone. [...] Remodeled to enhance range, it is made of yellow bamboo or sick bamboo, and possesses a single blowing hole, and seven holes to control pitch, though the seventh hole is not used. Of traditional and current instruments of Korean origin, the dangjeok has the highest pitch.|$|E

5000|$|The tritone {{paradox is}} an {{auditory}} illusion {{in which a}} sequentially played pair of Shepard tones [...] separated by an interval of a tritone, or <b>half</b> <b>octave,</b> is heard as ascending by some people and as descending by others. Different populations tend to favor one of a limited set of different spots around the chromatic circle as central to the set of [...] "higher" [...] tones. Roger Shepard in 1963 had argued that such tone pairs would be heard ambiguously as either ascending or descending. However, psychology of music researcher Diana Deutsch in 1986 discovered that when the judgments of individual listeners were considered separately, their judgments depended on {{the positions of the}} tones along the chromatic circle. For example, one listener would hear the tone pair C-F as ascending and the tone pair G-C as descending. Yet another listener would hear the tone pair C-F as descending and the tone pair G-C as ascending. Furthermore, the way these tone pairs were perceived varied depending on the listener’s language or dialect.|$|E
50|$|Interindividual {{differences}} {{have also been}} researched for the Tritone paradox illusion. In this illusion, the subject successively listens to two tones, which are separated by a <b>half</b> <b>octave.</b> Each tone is made {{of a set of}} harmonics which have an octave relation. The listener has to decide if the two tones have a descending or ascending relation. According to Diana Deutsch, the perception of the tones is influenced by the language spoken by the listener. The listener has a circular representation of the pitch of sounds that are common in their culture and based on that develops a pitch range of their speaking voice, which determines the orientation of the pitch class with respect to the height; when a given tone is in this range, it is taken as the highest position along the circle and depending on the second tone, the person perceives the pattern as ascending or descending. Deutsch found that for people from California, the tone in the highest position of the pitch-class circle is around C# and D whereas for people from southern England it is around G. According to those results, Deutsch hypothesized that the orientation of the pitch-class circle with respect to the height is similar for individuals from the same linguistic group and varies for individuals from different linguistic groups.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} if combining delayed auditory feedback (DAF) and frequency altered feedback (FAF) would be more fluency enhancing than either DAF or FAF alone. Ten stutterers read at normal and fast speech rates under nonaltered auditory feedback (NAF), DAF (i. e., a 50 ms delay), FAF (i. e., a one <b>half</b> <b>octave</b> downward shift), and a combination of DAF and FAF [(COMBO), i. e., a 50 ms delay plus a one <b>half</b> <b>octave</b> downward shift]. Results indicated that stuttering frequency was significantly reduced under all altered auditory conditions at both speech rates relative to the NAF condition. There was, however, no significant differences between the altered auditory feedback conditions (i. e., DAF, FAF, and COMBO). It is suggested that further studies be undertaken to explore the combination of altered auditory feedback conditions, as it may be the case that a floor effect was demonstrated with the singular presentations of DAF and FAF and further improvements in fluency enhancement could not be exhibited in the combined condition. Finally, these findings support the notion that a slowed rate of speech is not necessary for fluency enhancement under conditions of altered auditory feedback...|$|E
5000|$|Lehiste {{demonstrated}} {{that when the}} peak frequencies in a vowel spectrum (the so-called [...] "formants") are closer together than about <b>half</b> an <b>octave,</b> listeners respond as if the two peaks were merged into a single peak. Many vowel distinctions straddle this half-octave threshold, e.g., the first two formants of [...] "bought" [...] are closer than <b>half</b> an <b>octave,</b> while those of [...] "but" [...] are not; {{the second and third}} formants of [...] "bit" [...] are closer than <b>half</b> an <b>octave,</b> while those of [...] "bet" [...] are not.|$|R
5000|$|The pedal harp (also {{known as}} the concert harp) is a large and {{technically}} modern harp, designed primarily for classical music and played either solo, {{as part of a}} chamber ensemble, or in an orchestra.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new robust method for {{recognizing}} face images using a robust tensorial representation of binary gaussian jet maps (Tensor-Jet). This tensorial representation captures local appearance while retaining information about the spatial structure. During the tensors construction, each Gaussian Jet map is calculated with a <b>Half</b> <b>Octave</b> Gaussian Pyramid using a linear complexity algorithm. A Local Binary Pattern (LBP) operator is then applied {{and the results are}} accumulated in a local histogram. Local histograms are concatenated to form a tensorial representation that captures the spatial structure. The local correlation of neighboring histogram is removed by applying multi-linear principal components analysis. Finally a Kernel Discriminative Common vector is trained with the output of the MPCA to improve the overall recognition. We compare two different algorithms to recognize face images with this representation. Experimental results using the FERET database and Extended Yale Database show that this method compares favorably with the state-of-the-art methods in face recognition...|$|E
40|$|The motor protein prestin in {{the outer}} hair cells is a prime {{candidate}} for the molecular amplifier that ensures the sensitivity, frequency tuning and dynamic range of the mammalian cochlea. Absence of prestin results in a 40 - 60 dB reduction in cochlear neural sensitivity. Here we show that sound-evoked basilar membrane (BM) vibrations in the basal cochleae of prestin(-/-) mice are as sensitive as those of their prestin(+/+) siblings. BM vibrations in prestin(-/-) mice are, however, broadly tuned to a frequency similar to a <b>half</b> <b>octave</b> below the characteristic frequency (CF) of similar BM locations in prestin(+/+) mice. The peak sensitivity of prestin(+/+) BM tuning curves matches the neural thresholds, while prestin(-/-) BM tuning curves at the best frequency are > 50 dB more sensitive than the neural responses. We conclude that prestin influences properties of the cochlear partition that are crucial for BM frequency tuning and for converting its vibrations into neural excitation...|$|E
