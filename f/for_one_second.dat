25|$|There are {{two steps}} in the {{amendment}} process. Proposals to amend the Constitution must be properly adopted and ratified before they change the Constitution. First, there are two procedures for adopting the language of a proposed amendment, either by (a) Congress, by two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, or (b) national convention (which shall take place whenever two-thirds of the state legislatures collectively call <b>for</b> <b>one).</b> <b>Second,</b> there are two procedures for ratifying the proposed amendment, which requires three-fourths of the states' (presently 38 of 50) approval: (a) consent of the state legislatures, or (b) consent of state ratifying conventions. The ratification method is chosen by Congress for each amendment. State ratifying conventions were used only once, for the Twenty-first Amendment.|$|E

25|$|Massa kept {{within a}} {{reasonable}} {{gap between the two}} Mercedes cars and established a 2.4 second advantage over Ricciardo. Williams elected to make a pit stop for Bottas {{at the end of the}} 30th lap for medium compound tyres and Ricciardo responded by demonstrating quick pace to go seven-tenths of a second faster than Bottas in the final sector. Ricciardo made his pit stop on the following lap and emerged in front of Bottas. He began matching Massa's pace before the latter made his stop on lap 32 which proved problematic: his mechanics were delayed <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>second</b> when they were installing one of Massa's front tyres, allowing Ricciardo into third position. Hamilton entered the pit lane from the lead on the 33rd for his second (and final) stop and rejoined behind teammate Rosberg in second. Rosberg was informed by his team to increase his pace and led the field on the 34th lap before making his pit stop, handing the place back to Hamilton. Grosjean was passed by Vettel for tenth position on lap 37 and drew close to Magnussen shortly after. He overtook Magnussen around the outside three laps later but was unable to slow sufficiently and the latter reclaimed the position.|$|E

500|$|Co-showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman co-wrote the episode's teleplay, while Pinkner, Wyman, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman co-wrote the story. Executive producer Joe Chappelle served as director. A full season renewal of Fringe was announced on March 24, 2011. They {{had written the}} finale without knowing {{if there would be}} another season, but decided not to make any changes to the script even after hearing of its renewal. Pinkner explained that [...] "we wrote the episode, perhaps foolishly, assuming that we would be on for Season 4. We never <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>second</b> entertained that it {{would be the end of}} the series. So therefore, we didn't have to change a word!" [...] In an interview with the New York Post, Pinkner warned that events in the finale will [...] "unfurl in a very unexpected way for the characters and the audience". He also commented that the finale [...] "hopefully will make you sort of revisit and look at everything that's happened all year through a fresh pair of glasses".|$|E
500|$|... "Outta My Head" [...] {{was written}} by Savan Kotecha, Max Martin and Shellback, with {{production}} done by the latter two, for Lewis's second studio album, Echo (2009). It was recorded by Ann Miniceli at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and at Germano Studios in New York. She was assisted in the process by Christian Baker. It was mixed by Serban Genea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The Pro Tools engineer for the mixing was John Hanes, and his assistant was Tim Roberts. [...] "Outta My Head" [...] is an electropop song with Eurodance influences which lasts for a duration of three minutes and 39 seconds; it appears as the fifth song on the standard United Kingdom track list of Echo. On the US edition, it runs <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>second</b> less and is included as the sixth track. The instrumentation of [...] "Outta My Head" [...] {{is different from the}} rest of the songs on Echo and does not follow the same styles of production. Instead of using pianos and guitars, it employs [...] "stuttering keyboard riffs" [...] and [...] "cheap beats". The lyrics of the song contain a [...] "F**k you!" [...] sentiment.|$|E
500|$|The {{final three}} episodes {{of the season}} were [...] "linked in one {{continuous}} story arc," [...] and meant to seem like [...] "you're turning the last page of a chapter in a novel.

[...] The crew wrote the finale before the season was officially renewed, but deigned to leave it unchanged once discovering that a fourth season had been approved. Pinkner explained that [...] "we wrote the episode, perhaps foolishly, assuming that we would be on for Season 4. We never <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>second</b> entertained that it {{would be the end of}} the series. So therefore, we didn't have to change a word!" [...] The finale was designed to establish the groundwork by [...] "open a new chapter" [...] for the new season, which included Peter having never existed. Its futuristic storyline was meant to [...] "inform the present of the show with some thematic elements," [...] establishing to viewers that [...] "our world is going to break down." ...|$|E

No fragmentation observed, however, upon ion storage {{in the presence of}} a neutral bath gas at 1 × 10 − 3 torr <b>for</b> up to <b>one</b> <b>second.</b> The significance of this observation is that these non-covalently-bound ions, in which both the heme group and the polypeptide carry charge, are kinetically stable <b>for</b> over <b>one</b> <b>second</b> at room temperature and, perhaps, at higher temperatures. This suggests that are biologically relevant ions derived using electrospray and bound by non-covalent interactions can be studied using the various tools available with ion storage mass spectrometers and by other techniques that employ relatively high pressure environments for the study of gaseous ions...|$|R
500|$|... "Don't Let Me Down" [...] was co-written by Lewis with Mike Elizondo, James Fauntleroy, Timberlake and Robin Tadross.

500|$|Like in the song, in {{the music}} video Björk is {{depicted}} as [...] "Mother Oceania". The video opens with {{the surface of a}} body of water appearing yellowish and bright. Camera pans down to darker, deeper waters. Björk appears out of the dark background, singing and covered with sparkling jewels. As the second verse begins, images of jellyfish, representing the continents (her children) are thrown from Björk's hands. During the third verse they swim around and away from their mother, carried by the currents, which move in time with the song. In the bridge section, new sea flowers, with brilliant colors, emerge from the background, in contrast to the muted and darker colors of previous scenes. As the fifth verse continues, the camera pans back up to the much lighter surface, not seen {{since the beginning of the}} video. All sorts of marine life are swimming about the surface. Shortly after the sixth verse begins, Bjork is shown in deep, dark water. Several seconds later, the lighter surface of the water is shown without her. When she begins to sing [...] "Your sweat is salty", a somewhat rapid alternation of images ensues: the light surface is shown <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>second,</b> followed by Björk singing in the deep water; these scenes alternate until she stops singing during the coda. Björk's vocal repetition ceases at the same time the visual alternation stops. The surface scene recedes, and Björk in the deep water comes to the fore, slowing. At the end of the video, she stands and smiles.|$|E

2500|$|Win by fall: The {{object of}} the entire wrestling match is to attain victory by {{what is known as}} the fall.

Other techniques used to secure falls are cradles, the headlock (head and arm), single or double armbars (bar arms), the [...] "back bow" [...] and the leg Turk, the reverse body lock, the guillotine, the leg split (also known as the banana split or spread eagle), the spladle, the figure-4 to the head, the straight body scissors, and the double grapevine (also called the Saturday night ride).|$|E
