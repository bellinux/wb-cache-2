5|$|A second {{overhaul}} of AA defense was made between 1944 and 1945, as the Navy <b>had</b> <b>found</b> 20mm shells too light to stop Japanese kamikaze planes; this plus the higher approach speeds of these planes made these manually controlled guns obsolete. In their place, more quad 40mm Bofors mounts were fitted. Maryland eventually carried forty quad 40mm and eighteen 20mm guns. Colorados quad 40s were increased to forty {{but she kept}} all her 20mm guns. West Virginia carried forty quad 40mm and fifty 20mm. guns.|$|E

5|$|Although most of {{the judging}} had been {{completed}} before the fire, suggestions {{at the time that}} the committee could use what they had learned from the entrants to propose a new competition with greater clarity as to the requirements led to naught: a 1925 letter to the then Premier John Gunn reveals that there was little to be learned from the competition, as the assessors <b>had</b> <b>found</b> that none of the designs were suitable.|$|E

It is known that lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and other, more powerful, human DHFR inhibitors like methotrexate are known to be teratogenic.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{exploring}} {{the link between}} cancer and intelligence have come to varying conclusions.

This transition would require military aircraft to file flight plans and obey civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E

Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he <b>had</b> <b>found</b> the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.|$|E
