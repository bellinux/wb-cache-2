40|$|This diploma thesis {{follows the}} {{degradation}} of inkjet print by ultraviolet radiation and ozone effect for different types of papers. Colour test charts {{for the evaluation of}} accelerated ageing effect of ultraviolet light and <b>gas</b> <b>fading</b> were designed. These test charts were printed by dye-based inks on selected receiving media and exposed to ozone-enriched environment, UV radiation and their combination. The colorimetric values L* a* b* were calculated from spectral data of all patches of the test charts. The ozone effect on the prints was evaluated in the terms of total colour difference and dye concentration. The degradation of dye caused by ozone was observed also in a long-term period, after the contact of sample with ozone was terminated. Results of printed samples accelerated ageing by UV radiation and those that were influenced by the ozone effect were evaluated in the same way. It was found out that UV radiation and ozone treatment have a different effect on {{the degradation of}} dyes. The degradation rate is also strongly influenced by the receiving layer composition of papers used for inkjet printing. Also the catalytic effect of dyes was evaluated...|$|E

Spock believes that the workers serving aboard the floating city have been isolated {{from the effects of}} the zenite <b>gas,</b> which <b>fade</b> when an individual is removed from exposure.

500|$|Several {{models for}} the origin of gamma-ray bursts {{postulated}} that the initial burst of gamma rays should be followed by slowly fading emission at longer wavelengths created by collisions between the burst ejecta and interstellar <b>gas.</b> This <b>fading</b> emission would be called the [...] "afterglow". Early searches for this afterglow were unsuccessful, largely because {{it is difficult to}} observe a burst's position at longer wavelengths immediately after the initial burst. The breakthrough came in February 1997 when the satellite BeppoSAX detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 970228) and when the X-ray camera was pointed towards the direction from which the burst had originated, it detected fading X-ray emission. The William Herschel Telescope identified a fading optical counterpart 20 hours after the burst. Once the GRB faded, deep imaging was able to identify a faint, distant host galaxy at the location of the GRB as pinpointed by the optical afterglow.|$|R
50|$|However, {{nearing the}} stadium and the finish, he {{suddenly}} and completely {{ran out of}} <b>gas.</b> As he <b>faded,</b> thanks to the heat and his own ambitious pacemaking in extremely tough conditions, Gailly was reeled in by Delfero Cabrera (ARG) and Tom Richards (GBR). Entering the stadium in the lead but stumbling with exhaustion, the crowd roaring encouragement, he was passed by Cabrera during the final lap. He fell and was then passed by Richards. The crowd gasped with horror and willed him to get up. The home straight was an almost unending nightmare for Gailly, moving like a zombie, but despite falling again, he dragged himself half-standing over the line. He finished third to a standing ovation.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{challenging}} {{goals in the}} studies of many-body physics with ultracold atoms {{is the creation of}} a topological $p_{x} + ip_{y}$ superfluid for identical fermions in two dimensions (2 D). The expectations of reaching the critical temperature $T_c$ through p-wave Feshbach resonance in spin-polarized fermionic <b>gases</b> have soon <b>faded</b> away because on approaching the resonance, the system becomes unstable due to inelastic-collision processes. Here, we consider an alternative scenario in which a single-component degenerate gas of fermions in 2 D is paired via phonon-mediated interactions provided by a 3 D BEC background. Within the weak-coupling regime, we calculate the critical temperature $T_c$ for the fermionic pair formation, using Bethe-Salpeter formalism, and show that it is significantly boosted by higher-order diagramatic terms, such as phonon dressing and vertex corrections. We describe in detail an experimental scheme to implement our proposal, and show that the long-sought p-wave superfluid is at reach with state-of-the-art experiments.

40|$|Short abstract: We present fully 3 -D {{simulations}} of supersonic, radiatively cooling intermittent jets with intermediate and long variability periods (that is, periods {{of the order}} of or longer than, the dynamical time scale of the jet). Variations of intermediate period elucidate the formation and evolution of chains of internal regularly spaced radiative shocks, which in this work are identified with the observed emission knots of protostellar jets. Variations of long period elucidate the formation of multiple bow shock structures separated by long trails of diffuse gas, which resemble those observed in systems like HH 111 and HH 46 / 47. The time variability of the outflow is probably associated with observed irruptive events in the accretion process around the protostars. In our simulations, the outflow variations are produced by periodically turning on the outflow with a highly supersonic velocity and periodically turning off it to a low velocity regime. In the case of velocity variations of intermediate period, we find, as in previous work, that the shock structures form a train of regularly spaced emitting features which move away from the source with a velocity close to that of the outflow, have high radial motions, and produce low intensity spectra, as required by the observations. As they propagate downstream, the shocks widen and dissipate due to the expulsion of material sideways to the cocoon by the high pressure gradients of the postshock <b>gas.</b> This <b>fading</b> explains the most frequent occurence of knots closer to the driving source. In the case of the long period velocity variability, our simulations have produced a pair of bow-shock-like structures separated by a trail almostComment: accepted by ApJ, LaTex file, 33 pages; 7 Figures availableon request, USP-IAG pre...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{mainstream}} {{community of}} energy experts is {{not aware of}} the long-term impacts that carbon policies directly concerned with promoting the development of low-carbon technologies produce on the electricity market regime. Long-term market coordination should be replaced by public coordination with long-term arrangements. The current market coordination makes carbon pricing ineffective in orienting investors towards capital-intensive low-carbon technologies. Fossil fuel generation technologies are preferred because their investment risks are much lower in the market regime, even with a high but unstable carbon price. Thus, in order to avoid delaying investment that is aimed at the decarbonization of the electricity system, a number of new market arrangements that lower the investment risk of low-carbon technologies and provide output-based subsidization have or are being selected by governments. As the use of low-carbon equipment to produce electricity develops, long-term market coordination for other technologies (e. g. peaking units, combined cycle <b>gas</b> turbine) will <b>fade</b> away because they alter the market price setting. Thus it is likely that, in the future, public coordination and planning will replace the decisions of market players not only for low-carbon technologies but also for every other type of capacity development...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} second {{extensive}} {{study of the}} coronal line variability in an active galaxy. Our data set for the well-studied Seyfert galaxy NGC 5548 consists of five epochs of quasi-simultaneous optical and near-infrared spectroscopy spanning {{a period of about}} five years and three epochs of X-ray spectroscopy overlapping in time with it. Whereas the broad emission lines and hot dust emission varied only moderately, the coronal lines varied strongly. However, the observed high variability is mainly due to a flux decrease. Using the optical [FeVII] and X-ray OVII emission lines we estimate that the coronal line gas has a relatively low density of n~ 10 ^ 3 /cm^ 3 and a relatively high ionisation parameter of log U~ 1. The resultant distance of the coronal line gas from the ionising source of about eight light years places this region well beyond the hot inner face of the dusty torus. These results imply that the coronal line region is an independent entity. We find again support for the X-ray heated wind scenario of Pier & Voit; the increased ionising radiation that heats the dusty torus also increases the cooling efficiency of the coronal line gas, most likely due to a stronger adiabatic expansion. The much stronger coronal line variability of NGC 5548 relative to that of NGC 4151 can also be explained within this picture. NGC 5548 has much stronger coronal lines relative to the low ionisation lines than NGC 4151 indicating a stronger wind, in which case a stronger adiabatic expansion of the <b>gas</b> and so <b>fading</b> of the line emission is expected.
