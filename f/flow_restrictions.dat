500|$|With the Eisenhower Tunnel finished, {{the last}} {{remaining}} obstacle for I-70 to be an interstate commercial artery was the two lane, non-freeway portion in Glenwood Canyon. Construction had started on this section in the 1960s with a small section opening to traffic in 1966. The remainder was stopped due to environmentalist protests that caused a 30-year controversy. The original design was criticized as [...] "the epitome of environmental insensitivity". Engineers scrapped the original plans and started work on a new design that would minimize additional environmental impacts. A new design was underway by 1971, which was approved in 1975; however, environmental groups filed lawsuits to stop construction, and the controversy continued even when construction finally resumed in 1981. The final design included 40 bridges and viaducts, three additional tunnel bores (two were completed before construction was stopped in the 1960s) and [...] of retaining walls for a stretch of freeway [...] long. The project was further complicated {{by the need to}} build the four-lane freeway without disturbing the operations of the railroad. This required using special and coordinated blasting techniques. Engineers designed two separate tracks for the highway, one elevated above the other, to minimize the footprint in the canyon. The final design was praised for its environmental sensitivity. A Denver architect who helped design the freeway proclaimed, [...] "Most of the people in western Colorado see it as having preserved the canyon." [...] He further stated, [...] "I think pieces of the highway elevate to the standard of public art."

The hydrodynamic energy (Energy grade line or EGL) of venous outflows must also vary considerably between vascular beds. We explored {{the mechanism of}} venous admixture of differing energy flows using a mechanical model. Materials and methods. The model simulated two venous flows coalescing at a venous junction and then flowing through collapsible venous pumps.

With increasing EGL differences between two coalescing venous flows, reduction or cessation (venous <b>flow</b> <b>restriction)</b> of the weaker flow occurred during steady state; higher base EGL of both flows ameliorated venous <b>flow</b> <b>restriction</b> and lower base EGL the opposite.

2500|$|Tesla's design {{attempted}} to sidestep the key drawbacks of the bladed axial turbines, {{and even the}} lowest estimates for efficiency still dramatically outperformed the efficiency of axial steam turbines of the day. However, in testing against more modern engines, the Tesla Turbine had expansion efficiencies far below contemporary steam turbines and far below contemporary reciprocating steam engines. [...] It does suffer from other problems such as shear losses and <b>flow</b> <b>restrictions,</b> but this is partially offset by the relatively massive reduction in weight and volume. Some of Tesla turbine's advantages lie in relatively low flow rate applications or when small applications are called for. The disks need to be as thin as possible at the edges {{in order not to}} introduce turbulence as the fluid leaves the disks. This translates to needing {{to increase the number of}} disks as the flow rate increases. Maximum efficiency comes in this system when the inter-disk spacing approximates the thickness of the boundary layer, and since boundary layer thickness is dependent on viscosity and pressure, the claim that a single design can be used efficiently for a variety of fuels and fluids is incorrect. A Tesla turbine differs from a conventional turbine only in the mechanism used for transferring energy to the shaft. Various analyses demonstrate the flow rate between the disks must be kept relatively low to maintain efficiency. Reportedly, the efficiency of the Tesla turbine drops with increased load. Under light load, the spiral taken by the fluid moving from the intake to the exhaust is a tight spiral, undergoing many rotations. Under load, the number of rotations drops and the spiral becomes progressively shorter. [...] This will increase the shear losses and also reduce the efficiency because the gas is in contact with the discs for less distance.|$|E

Sixteen untrained females performed unilateral plantar-flexion low-load resistance training (LLRT) at either 25 % (n = 8) or 50 % (n = 8) one-repetition maximum (1 RM). One limb was trained with unrestricted blood flow whilst in the other limb blood flow was restricted {{with the use of}} a pressure applied cuff above the knee (110 mmHg). Regardless of the training load, peak PObf, measured using venous occlusion plethysmography increased when LLRT was performed with blood <b>flow</b> <b>restriction</b> compared to no change following LLRT with unrestricted blood flow. A significant increase (P < 0. 05) in the area under the blood time–flow curve was also observed following LLRT with blood <b>flow</b> <b>restriction</b> when compared LLRT with unrestricted blood flow. No changes were observed in R bf between groups following training. Maximal dynamic strength (1 RM), maximal voluntary contraction and isokinetic strength at 0. 52 and 1. 05 rad s− 1 also increased (P < 0. 05) by a greater extent following resistance training with blood <b>flow</b> <b>restriction.</b> Moreover, 1 RM increased to a greater extent following training at 50 % 1 RM compared to 25 % 1 RM.

The intramuscular pressures in the quadriceps are probably quite high already at low-to-moderate loads in this exercise, sufficient to induce relative ischemia {{as long as the}} muscle is under tension. Fatiguing low-load dynamic knee extension exercise both with and without blood <b>flow</b> <b>restriction</b> induces DOMS. Fatiguing low-load dynamic knee extension exercise both with and without blood <b>flow</b> <b>restriction</b> induces high muscle activity in the quadriceps. Not only the concentric but also the eccentric muscle activity increases as the point of torque failure draws closer. Very likely, this indicates a high degree of muscle fiber recruitment, possibly also during eccentric muscle actions. Multiple sets of low-load resistance exercise to failure with BFR induce decrements in maximum torque capacity and signs of increased sarcolemmal permeability and damage at the muscle fiber level. These phenomena were also observed in the freeflow leg, but to a lesser degree. Multiple sets of low-load resistance exercise to failure with BFR appear to induce long-lasting (> 24 hours) increases in hypertrophic signaling, and rapid increases in satellite cell numbers. These phenomena were also observed in the free-flow leg, but to a somewhat lesser degree with regard to signaling. Paper I: Wernbom M, Augustsson J, Thomeé R.
