5|$|Players not {{returning}} from the previous season included: Horse Bishop, Cecil Beck, Speedy Walker, Tom Fuller, Charlie Tucker, and Bill Middlekauff. Practice was opened on September 3. A wealth of talented players from Florida high schools was expected. After spending just two weeks with the team, while many players were engaged in other sports, Bachman declared his backfield material as the finest <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had.</b>|$|E
5|$|As well as {{teaching}} music at Hull House, Smith {{served as the}} choral director. She also composed songs and arranged music specifically for her students to perform. She initiated an annual Christmas concert which also included a dramatic presentation and was eagerly anticipated by the neighborhood for its holiday pageantry. Under her direction of the music school, the Hull House Boy's Band developed, which included immigrant boys from the neighborhood who would later become noted jazz performers. Jazz pianist Art Hodes recalled {{that one of the}} first jam sessions <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> occurred when a young clarinetist named Benny Goodman joined the Boy's Band. James Petrillo, who would later become the leader of the musician's union, the American Federation of Musicians, was {{also a member of the}} group.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had.</b> The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E

25|$|Later on 8 August 2017, {{documents}} were revealed by BuzzFeed indicating that One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts, {{who was born}} in India of an Australian mother and a British father, was a British citizen at the age of 19. Roberts stated that he had only ever been an Australian and that, in case <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> British citizenship, before the 2016 election he took reasonable steps to renounce it. On 9 August 2017, the Senate, with all-party support, referred his position to the High Court as Court of Disputed Returns. The referral was moved by Roberts's party leader Pauline Hanson, with his support.|$|E

25|$|He {{was born}} in India of an Australian mother and a British father.

Roberts stated that he had only ever been an Australian and that, in case <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> British citizenship, before the 2016 election he took reasonable steps to renounce it. Doubts were cast upon his view of the position. He could have also been an Indian citizen, as any person born in India on or after 26 January 1950, but prior to the commencement of the 1986 Act on 1 July 1987, is a citizen of India by birth.|$|E
25|$|Madri, {{the second}} wife of Pandu, immolates herself. She {{believes}} she {{is responsible for}} his death, {{as he had been}} cursed with death if <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> intercourse. He died while performing the forbidden act with Madri; she blamed herself for not rejecting him, as she knew of the curse. Also, in the case of Madri the entire assembly of sages sought to dissuade her from the act, and no religious merit is attached to the fate she chooses against all advice. In the Musala-parvan of the Mahabharata, the four wives of Vasudeva are said to commit sati. Furthermore, as news of Krishna's death reaches Hastinapur, five of his wives choose to burn themselves.|$|E
25|$|Arizona's {{changing}} population also hurt Goldwater. The state's {{population had}} soared, {{and a huge}} portion of the electorate had not lived in the state when Goldwater was previously elected; hence, many voters were less familiar with Goldwater's actual beliefs, {{and he was on}} the defensive for much of the campaign. Early returns on election night seemed to indicate that Schulz would win. The counting of votes continued through the night and into the next morning. At around daybreak, Goldwater learned that he had been reelected thanks to absentee ballots, which were among the last to be counted. Goldwater's surprisingly close victory in 1980 came despite Reagan's 61% landslide over Jimmy Carter in Arizona. Republicans regained control of the Senate, putting Goldwater in the most powerful position <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> in the Senate.|$|E

25|$|Washington {{mounted a}} {{comeback}} {{in the bottom}} of the seventh, when Espinosa led off with a walk and pinch-hitter Chris Heisey followed with a two-run homer off reliever Grant Dayton to cut the Dodgers′ lead to 4-3. When first baseman Clint Robinson followed immediately with a single, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts made the unconventional move of bringing in closer Kenley Jansen to pitch in the seventh inning, something Jansen had not done since 2013. Although the Nats put pressure on Jansen, with Harper singling and Murphy intentionally walked to load the bases, Jansen struck out Rendon for the third out to preserve the Dodgers' lead. Jansen pitched into the ninth inning without giving up another hit, throwing 51 pitches – nine more than <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> before. When Jansen tired {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, walking Harper and Werth with one out, Roberts made another unconventional move, bringing Clayton Kershaw - who had started Game 1 and, on short rest, Game 4 – in for the first save of his career. Kershaw got Murphy to pop out for the second out, and, with no one else left on the bench to face Kershaw, Baker sent rookie Wilmer Difo to the plate. Kershaw struck out the overmatched Difo to preserve a 4-3 win and give Los Angeles a 3-2 series victory. The Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs in the NLDS for the third time in five years, and the Dodgers advanced to face the Chicago Cubs in the 2016 National League Championship Series.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{retired after}} the Celtics {{did not offer}} him a new {{contract}} {{at the beginning of}} the 1991 season.

During the primary, Edward Moskal, president of the Polish American Congress, a political action committee endorsing Kaszak, called Emanuel a [...] "millionaire carpetbagger." [...] Emanuel won the primary and defeated Republican candidate Mark Augusti in the general election.

Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast. He noted that [...] "it was really thrilling. It was my first lead and I was pretty nervous, but I really wanted that part and I wanted to tell those stories." [...] Fillion later said he was [...] "heartbroken" [...] when he learned the series had been cancelled.

500|$|The name Ladas, {{derived from}} that of Alexander the Great's messenger, had {{previously}} been used by Lord Rosebery's father for a horse who ran unplaced in the 1869 Derby. Rosebery, then an under-graduate at Oxford University, had tipped the horse to his friends as a likely winner and was reportedly mortified by the result. By way of an apology, Rosebery told his friends that if <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> a horse with a [...] "prime chance" [...] of winning the Derby, he would name him [...] "Ladas" [...] {{so that they could}} all [...] "take the tip and back him."

500|$|Bradley {{had left}} the door open for Venable to come take batting {{practice}} if <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> the urge. As a sophomore, at the suggestion of his mother, Venable resumed baseball. He posted modest numbers in his first season, but in 2004, he hit for a [...]344batting average, earned All-Ivy honorable mention, and was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the fifteenth round of the draft (439th overall). Bradley felt that Major League Baseball scouts undervalued Venable because he did not participate in the Cape Cod League for college baseball players. Thus, instead of signing and giving up his amateur status, Venable returned for his senior season and posted a league leading 9home runs and runner-up [...]385 batting average while earning All-League honors. Subsequently, the Padres drafted him in the seventh round (215th overall); he was signed by the Padres' Northeast Scouting Director, Jim Bretz.|$|E
