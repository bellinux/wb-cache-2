It is known that the total disconnectedness of F in the topology induced by the order makes the usual (topological) notions of continuity and differentiability too weak to extend real calculus results to F. In this paper, we introduce new stronger concepts of continuity and differentiability which we call <b>derivate</b> continuity and <b>derivate</b> differentiability [2, 12]; and we show that <b>derivate</b> continuous and differentiable functions satisfy the usual addition, product and composition rules and that n-times <b>derivate</b> differentiable functions satisfy a Taylor formula with remainder {{similar to that of}} the real case. Then we generalize the definitions of <b>derivate</b> continuity and <b>derivate</b> differentiability to multivariable F-valued functions and we prove related results that are useful for doing analysis on F and F n in general...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Reduction {{of blood}} flow is {{important}} in the induction of neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC) in lumbar spinal canal stenosis. PGE 1 improves the mean walking distance in patients with NIC type cauda equina compression. PGE 1 <b>derivate</b> might be effective in dilating blood vessels and improving blood flow in nerve roots with chronically compressed cauda equina. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether PGE 1 <b>derivate</b> has vasodilatory effects on both arteries and veins in a canine model of chronic cauda equina compression. Methods Fourteen dogs were used in this study. A plastic balloon inflated to 10 mmHg was placed under the lamina of the 7 th lumbar vertebra for 1 week. OP- 1206 -cyclodextrin clathrate (OP- 1206 -CD: prostaglandin E 1 <b>derivate)</b> was administered orally. The blood vessels of the second or third sacral nerve root were identified using a specially designed surgical microscope equipped with a video camera. The diameter of the blood vessels was measured on video-recordings every 15 minutes until 90 minutes after the administration of the PGE 1 <b>derivate.</b> Results We observed seven arteries and seven veins. The diameter and blood flow of the arteries was significantly increased compared with the veins at both 60 and 75 minutes after administration of the PGE 1 <b>derivate</b> (p Discussion The PGE 1 <b>derivate</b> improved blood flow in the arteries but did not induce blood stasis in the veins. Our results suggest that the PGE 1 <b>derivate</b> might be a potential therapeutic agent, as it improved blood flow in the nerve roots in a canine model of chronic cauda equina compression. </p...|$|R
25|$|Study of kōan {{literature}} {{is common to}} all schools of Zen, though with varying emphases and curriculae. The Rinzai-school uses extensive koan-curricula, checking questions, and jakogo ("capping phrases", quotations from Chinese poetry) in its use of koans. The Sanbo Kyodan, and its western <b>derivates</b> of Taizan Maezumi and the White Plum Asanga, also use koan-curricula, but have omitted the use of capping phrases. In Chinese Chán and Korean Seon, {{the emphasis is on}} Hua Tou, the study of one koan throughout one's lifetime. In Japanese Soto-Zen, the use of koans has been abandoned since the late eighteenth and nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|The Ford Falcon was a {{full-sized}} car {{manufactured by}} the Ford Motor Company of Australia from 1960 to 2016. From the XA series of 1972 onward, each Falcon {{and range of}} <b>derivates</b> have been designed, developed, and built in Australia, following the phasing out of the American-influenced Falcon of 1960 to 1971, which had been re-engineered locally as the XK to XY series for the harsher Australian conditions. The luxury-oriented Ford Fairmont model joined the range from 1965. Luxury long-wheelbase derivative versions called the Ford Fairlane and LTD arrived in 1967 and 1973, respectively (with production ending in 2007).|$|E
25|$|The {{derivatives}} provide {{detailed information}} for such optimizers, but are {{even harder to}} calculate, e.g. approximating the gradient takes at least N+1 function evaluations. For approximations of the 2nd derivatives (collected in the Hessian matrix) the number of function evaluations is {{in the order of}} N². Newton's method requires the 2nd order <b>derivates,</b> so for each iteration the number of function calls is in the order of N², but for a simpler pure gradient optimizer it is only N. However, gradient optimizers need usually more iterations than Newton's algorithm. Which one is best with respect to the number of function calls depends on the problem itself.|$|E

25|$|The simple phenols are not {{the only}} active element in wood-tar creosote. In solution, they {{coagulate}} albumin, which is a water-soluble protein found in meat; so they serve as a preserving agent, but also cause denaturation. Most of the phenols in the creosote are methoxy derivatives—they contain the methoxy group linked to the benzene nucleus (OCH3). The high level of methyl <b>derivates</b> created from the action of heat on wood (also apparent in the methyl alcohol produced through distillation) make wood-tar creosote substantially different from coal-tar creosote. Guaiacol is a methyl ether of pyrocatechin, while creosol is a methyl ether of methyl-pyrocatechin, the next homolog of pyrocatechin. Methyl ethers differ from simple phenols in being less hydrophilic, caustic and poisonous. This allows meat to successfully be preserved without tissue denaturation, and allows creosote {{to be used as a}} medical ointment.|$|E
25|$|Fiat {{has been}} present in Argentina since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. There was a Fiat manufacturing plant in Córdoba at least as far back as 1954 when Fiat entered into a joint venture with two local companies to manufacture tractors. The company was known as Fiat-Concord until 1980. In 1959 the construction of a car plant in Caseros was approved, and 1960 saw the production there of the first Argentinian produced Fiat passenger car, a Fiat 600, after the Fiat 1100 Export and after in 1963 the Fiat 1500. In 1977 appears the Fiat 133, just a rebadged Seat 133 but made in Argentina. By 1978 a car manufacturing facility was well established in Córdoba, producing Fiat 128s as well as two models which from the Italian perspective belonged in earlier decades, the 125 (with some <b>derivates)</b> and the 600R.|$|E
