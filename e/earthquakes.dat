5|$|For {{three months}} in 1985, 3,000 minor <b>earthquakes</b> were {{detected}} in the northwestern section of the park, during what {{has been referred to}} as an earthquake swarm, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera. Beginning on April 30, 2007, 16 small <b>earthquakes</b> with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These swarms of <b>earthquakes</b> are common, and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2008. In December 2008, over 250 <b>earthquakes</b> were measured over a four-day span under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9. In January 2010, more than 250 <b>earthquakes</b> were detected over a two-day period. Seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{all of the}} {{territory}} of Chile is subject to <b>earthquakes,</b> arising from strains in the subducting Nazca and South American Plates or shallow strike-slip faults. The subduction zone along the Chilean coast produced the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. Some <b>earthquakes</b> which occurred near the epicentre of the 11 March 2010 event are the 1985 Algarrobo and Rapel Lake <b>earthquakes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Qeshm Island {{is part of}} the Simply Folded Belt, {{the most}} seismically active part of the Zagros fold and thrust belt. Similar to most <b>earthquakes</b> in the area, the 2005 event {{resulted}} from reverse slip faulting. Since it lies in such a seismically active area, there is a high risk of destructive <b>earthquakes</b> in Iran; 1 in 3,000 deaths are attributable to <b>earthquakes.</b> One geophysicist has cited the lack of strict building codes as a serious concern.|$|E

5|$|Control {{went back}} and forth at the {{beginning}} of the match between Hulk Hogan and <b>Earthquake.</b> When <b>Earthquake</b> rolled out of the ring, both wrestlers' corner-men got involved, as Hogan and the Big Boss Man fought against <b>Earthquake</b> and Dino Bravo. Bravo and <b>Earthquake</b> powerslammed Hogan while the referee was distracted, which allowed <b>Earthquake</b> to lock Hogan in a Boston crab hold. After being powerslammed outside of the ring by <b>Earthquake,</b> Hogan tried to lift his opponent but was unsuccessful. <b>Earthquake</b> powerslammed Hogan and performed two <b>Earthquake</b> splashes but was unable to get the pinfall. Hogan recovered and bodyslammed <b>Earthquake.</b> He performed a legdrop on <b>Earthquake</b> before <b>Earthquake's</b> manager, Jimmy Hart interfered. Hogan threw him out of the ring and then bodyslammed <b>Earthquake</b> onto a table at ringside. Hogan got back into the ring and won the match via countout. <b>Earthquake</b> attacked Hogan after the match, but the Big Boss Man saved Hogan by hitting <b>Earthquake</b> with a chair.|$|R
5|$|Several <b>earthquakes</b> {{occurred}} in subsequent years, but they caused comparatively little damage. One, on 15 June 1803, affected Bucharest's water system and rendered many pumps unusable. Three other major <b>earthquakes</b> {{occurred in}} 1804 and 1812.|$|E
5|$|The Canterbury {{region was}} hit by a series of <b>{{earthquake}}s,</b> and the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake damaged the office building beyond repair.

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{originated in}} the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, a fault noted for <b>earthquakes</b> of moderate magnitude. Faulting in the area is strike-slip-oriented probably because of the Alabama-New York Lineament, which runs adjacent to the fault. Several scientists believe that the small <b>earthquakes</b> from the zone highlight the reactivation of deep, ancient faults. Alabama has seen roughly 20 <b>earthquakes</b> {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century. The <b>earthquakes</b> have been moderate, never reaching above magnitude 5.1, and tend to cause damage only near their epicenters while reaching areas much further away. Major events include those in 1916, 1997, and 2003. Despite the lack of powerful seismic events in Alabama, <b>earthquakes</b> from nearby fault zones, including the New Madrid Seismic Zone, pose a serious threat to infrastructure. Even an earthquake similar in size to the 1916Irondaleevent today could damage thousands of buildings and cause up to $1billion in damage.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{originated in}} the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, among the most active seismic areas in the Southeastern United States and one capable of producing moderately strong <b>earthquakes,</b> a few of which have caused damage. The frequency for non-damaging <b>earthquakes</b> from this zone measures out to about one per year, and it has produced many faint <b>earthquakes</b> recorded on seismographs. Such <b>earthquakes</b> have been helpful in highlighting the activity of faults below the Paleozoic detachment. Fault-plane solutions of multiple <b>earthquakes</b> throughout the area confirmed strike-slip faulting between two steeply declining planes. Both right and left-lateral movement occurs in the area, most movement being associated with north-to-south planes (right-lateral) and east-to-west planes (left-lateral). All of these mechanisms indicate reactivation of basement faults below more-recent faults. These basement faults probably converge on one another, and one being strong and the other being weak, produce <b>earthquakes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>earthquakes</b> of Iran {{are a large}} {{concern to}} the populace and are an {{impediment}} to economic development. Twelve <b>earthquakes</b> with a Richter magnitude of over seven have occurred within the last century. Three-quarters of the major cities of Iran are in areas prone to major <b>earthquakes.</b> The 1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake, with at least 42,000 fatalities, cost Iran roughly 7.2 percent of its Gross National Product (GNP) for that year and wiped out two years of economic growth.|$|E
5|$|A focal {{mechanism}} {{solution of}} the earthquake confirmed two nodal planes both striking north-south and dipping approximately 45degrees {{to the east and}} to the west. This faulting suggests dip slip reverse motion, and to a horizontal east-west axis of confining stress. The rupture also occurred partially on the New Madrid Fault, responsible for the great New Madrid <b>earthquakes</b> in 1812, consisting of the most powerful <b>earthquakes</b> to hit the contiguous United States.|$|E

30|$|One typical {{example of}} a large inland <b>earthquake</b> that {{occurred}} after a large interplate <b>earthquake</b> in NE Japan is the 1896 M 7.2 Riku-u <b>earthquake.</b> The <b>earthquake</b> occurred 2.5 months after the 1896 M 8 Sanriku tsunami <b>earthquake</b> (e.g. Kanamori, 1972). Ohtake (1997) suggested {{the possibility that the}} reduction of normal stress by the Sanriku <b>earthquake</b> triggered the Riku-u <b>earthquake</b> if the fault plane of the Riku-u <b>earthquake</b> was steeply dipping, although the fault has been estimated to be possibly not steeply dipping in later studies (~ 30 °; from Sato et al., 2002).|$|R
5|$|At {{least two}} episodes of <b>earthquakes</b> {{constitute}} the Nazko swarm. In the first seismic phase from October 9 to November 1, 2007, {{a total of}} 153 <b>earthquakes</b> took place. During the second seismic phase between September 25, 2007 and June 12, 2008, 4,428 <b>earthquakes</b> occurred. These two seismic episodes were cross-correlated by scientists to understand changes {{in the development of}} the earthquake swarm. Correlation coefficients were around 1.0 for the beginnings of the periods of activity, indicating almost identical situations, and then decayed to around 0.5, indicating a decrease in similarity between the later stages of the two events.|$|E
5|$|Before the Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm began in 2007, the Anahim hotspot {{was not known}} to be an earthquake zone. On October 10 of the following year, a swarm of <b>earthquakes</b> occurred.

5|$|<b>Earthquakes</b> in Alabama are sporadic, {{and tend}} to cause little to no damage. During a 91-year period, there were 19earthquakes, varying from near-imperceptible to damaging. The first known {{activity}} in Alabama, the New Madrid <b>earthquakes</b> of 1812, registered Mercalli intensities of VII (Very strong) throughout the northern and central portions of the state.

5|$|Even though {{earthquake}} swarms can be dangerous, {{scientists are}} able to model such events to analyze their structure. During the earthquake swarm in 2007, {{a group of scientists}} investigated the possibility that a volcanic eruption would occur. Five additional seismographs were placed in the earthquake zone, and scientists closely monitored the seismic activity. After additional data were gathered, scientists with the United States Geological Survey, the University of Washington, and other organizations, agreed that the Nazko <b>earthquakes</b> probably originated from movement of magma beneath the surface near Nazko Cone. However, because of the number and small size of the Nazko <b>earthquakes,</b> no volcanic eruption is likely. Other recent <b>earthquakes</b> in North America that have been attributed to magma but did not result in a volcanic eruption include the 2003 <b>earthquakes</b> under Lake Tahoe in the U.S. state of California and a 2004 earthquake swarm at Jordan Craters in the U.S. state of Oregon.|$|E

5|$|Patterns of seismic {{activity}} detected by paleoseismology {{suggest that the}} filling of Lake Cahuilla might have triggered stress changes that caused <b>earthquakes</b> along the San Andreas Fault and other faults when they were already close to rupture.

Alternatively, <b>earthquakes</b> could have caused course changes in the Colorado River that then caused the lake to flood or to dry up; paleoseismology in Coachella is consistent with this hypothesis. Some <b>earthquakes</b> such as the 1892 Laguna Salada earthquake caused large vertical displacements that could have triggered flooding. Conversely, tectonically driven uplift of the northern side of the Colorado River Delta tends to stabilize the present southward course of the river against diversions to the north.|$|E
