While at Blanding he was called to the War Department in Washington, where he was given an assignment to be a staff officer in London, but this rapidly changed when he was subsequently called to the War College, and met a classmate from Command and General Staff School, Brigadier General Mark Clark, who told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being assigned to the Forty-fifth Infantry Division at Fort Devens, Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|He {{appears to}} have {{believed}} himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. Olympias always insisted to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the son of Zeus, a theory apparently confirmed {{to him by the}} oracle of Amun at Siwa. He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform. This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen. However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine. Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.|$|E

Breuer later clarified his comments on Facebook that did not end speculation on Johnson's future with the band.|$|E
5|$|In July 1782, Scott was {{exchanged}} for Lord Rawdon, ending his parole. Washington informed <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> back {{on active duty}} and ordered him to assist General Peter Muhlenberg's recruiting efforts in Virginia, then to report to General Nathanael Greene. Greene wrote {{that he did not}} have a command for Scott, however, and requested that he remain with Muhlenberg in Virginia. The few troops he was able to recruit were sent to a depot at Winchester, Virginia. When the preliminary articles of peace between the United States and Great Britain were signed in March 1783, recruiting stopped altogether. Scott was brevetted to major general on September 30, 1783, just prior to his discharge from the Continental Army. Following the war, he became one of the founding members of the Society of the Cincinnati.|$|E

He killed Šarac so the Turks would not use him for menial labor, and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial. Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija. Vaso took Marko to Mount Athos and buried him at the Hilandar Monastery in an unmarked grave.|$|E

There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so. Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, {{but by the end}} of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> ready for the NBA. He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season and entered the 2003 NBA draft.
