30|$|The {{adhesion}} {{testing was}} carried out using an <b>Elcometer</b> 110 P.A.T.T.I. pneumatic tester according to the ASTM D 4541 - 95 e 1 standard. A Ag nanowire-AAM on Si sample was selected to avoid the effect of oxidation of the copper nanowire tips. The sample size was 11 mm in diameter. The diameter of the test stud was 8.16 mm which is related to 0.52 -cm 2 test area. To run the adhesion test, the stud {{was attached to the}} Ag nanowire-AAM surface with Araldite epoxy adhesive as shown in Figure S 1 a (see Additional file 1). The Si wafer was attached on a flat metal base plate as shown in Figure S 1 b (see Additional file 1). For execution of a pull-off test, the stud of the test equipment has to be firmly attached to the nanowire-AAM surface. To ensure this, the surfaces of the stud and the nanowire-AAM composite were polished using a coarse sand paper and subsequently cleaned in acetone before applying the adhesive epoxy. After the sample was mounted, the specimen under test was pulled perpendicular to the wafer substrate until some part of the structure under ruptures.|$|E

We decided to use different methodologies to investigate the slab: namely a pacometer (Protovale <b>Elcometer)</b> to individuate the internal coupling pins, and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) (2000 MHz) and ultrasonic (55 kHz) tomographic high-density surveys to investigate the internal extension of all the visible fractures and to search for the hidden ones. For the ultrasonic data, tests were carried out to optimize the inversion parameters, in particular the cell dimensions. The choice of cell size for the inversion process must take into account the size of the acquisition grid and the ray number acquired. We proposed to calculate a minimum Fresnelâ€™s radius using the sampling frequency instead of that of the probes. For every methodology used, the quality of the acquired data was relatively high. This was then processed and compared to provide information that was useful for some of the insurance problems of the museum. Later on, the data was processed in depth to see how to improve the data processing and interpretation. Finally, the results of this in-depth study were exposed in detail. Ultrasonic and GPR tomographies show a strong correlation, and in particular, the inhomogeneous areas are located in correspondence to the slab injuries...|$|E
40|$|Pharmaceuticals in aquatic {{environment}} are considered as emerging environmental contaminants {{due to their}} constant presence, evironmental resistance and toxic effect they could have on aquatic organisms. Studies for Slovenia have shown the presence of pharmaceutical substances in waters to be comparable with published results of pharmaceutical water pollution in Europe. As conventional methods do not reach efficient pharmaceutical removal from water sources, more powerful and effective methods like heterogeneous photocatalysis using TiO 2 /UV have been implemented. Titanium dioxide coatings in silicate binder were prepared by the sol-gel process and deposited on a glass support with dip-coating technique. The films showed good quality and possibility of multiple use. The characterization of the films was performed with scanning electron microscope (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and hardness test (<b>Elcometer</b> 501 Pencil Hardness Tester). Effectiveness and quality of prepared TiO 2 coatings for photodegradation of pharmaceutical compound paracetamol (PCT) were assessed during photocatalytic treatment and compared to photolysis, a process without presence of a catalyst. Photolysis caused substantial changes in paracetamol concentration between 120 and 180 minutes of irradiation where 92 % of degradation was achieved, but with no changes in mineralization. Photocatalytic treatment was much faster and effective where 95 % of paracetamol degraded within 90 minutes of UV irradiation and after prolonged irradiation time from 120 to 240 minutes also mineralization of paracetamol solution increased from 59 % to 83 %. Accordingly, toxicity decreased, {{but it was still}} not lower than in the starting PCT solution as it was shown by acute toxicity test on Daphnia magna aquatic organisms. The master thesis represents a step forward in studying photocatalytic removal of paracetamol from water, because to my knowledge all the published investigations on this pharmaceutical up to now include photocatalyst mostly in powder and not in immobilized form, which is more advantageous from application point of view...|$|E
