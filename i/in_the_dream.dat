5|$|Unique to Black and White is the Pokémon Dream World, {{which is}} {{dependent}} on the official Pokémon Global Link website. Here, the player can befriend Pokémon that are not normally obtainable in-game and that have unique abilities. This occurs after syncing the game back with the Dream World, similarly to the Pokéwalker from HeartGold and SoulSilver. The player can maintain a house <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> World that other players can visit as well as grow berries. In addition to allowing access to Pokémon acquired <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> World, the Entralink also enables players to interact with each other and play side-games. These side-games award points that can be traded for temporary powers such as increasing experience, improving capture rate, or lowering prices of items in Poké Marts.|$|E

As the first boss character from The King of Fighters, the SNK staff created him {{to be one of}} the most difficult characters to defeat. His Omega Rugal form from 95 has been noted by the staff to be their favorite boss to the point they added him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> Match titles. Publications for video games and other media have provided praise and criticism for Rugal's character.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before Christmas 1095, one of St-Calais' knights, Boso, {{fell ill}} and dreamed he was {{transported to the}} afterlife, where he found a large house with gates made of iron. Suddenly, St-Calais emerged from the gates, asking the knight the {{whereabouts}} {{of one of his}} servants. Boso's guide <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dream</b> then informed Boso that this was a warning that St-Calais would soon die. Boso recovered and warned St-Calais of the dream.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} six levels {{and a final}} battle. The player {{controls}} Bart as he helps his sister Maggie recover her ball, explores the basement and attic of the Simpsons' home, sneaks out to the movie theater and the Springfield Mall, and has a dream {{in which he is}} inserted into the Itchy & Scratchy universe. During these levels, Bart fights dust bunnies, spiders (in the attic), ghosts (in the basement), space mutants (at the movie theater), and Itchy and Scratchy (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dream</b> world).|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Tactics Advance {{revolves}} around three primary characters: Marche Radiuju, {{the main character}} who battles the dream worlds of his friends; Ritz Malheur, a stubborn girl who speaks her mind and changes sides in her struggle for self-acceptance; and Mewt Randell, a boy whose mother died that discovers a magical entity that changes the world {{into the world of}} Ivalice. There are also secondary characters, such as Doned Radiuju, Marche's little brother who does not desire to return to the real world, since he is sick in the real world and healthy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dream</b> one; and Cid Randell, Mewt's father who becomes the Judgemaster of Ivalice.|$|E
5|$|Dialogue heard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dream</b> {{sequence}} uses {{a distinctive}} reversed manner of speech. This {{was achieved by}} recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.|$|E

The {{timeline}} of the Dream arc has been reset, {{although it is}} now seen through the viewpoint of a crow Misuzu finds and names Sora. New things are revealed that were not seen following Yukito <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> arc. After Misuzu finds Sora and brings him back home, her condition worsens and eventually she forgets even who Haruko is. Misuzu's father, Keisuke Tachibana, shows up during this arc wanting to take Misuzu back to his home, but Haruko pleads with him to grant her more time, and they agree on extending the time for three more days. After the three days pass, Keisuke comes back and sees the love between Misuzu and Haruko; he decides to let them stay together.

The burned man cuts Dean's throat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dream,</b> but in reality it appears that Dean is cutting his own throat as his friend, {{waitress}} Nancy Holbrook (Rooney Mara), looks on with Kris. At Dean's funeral, Kris sees a photograph of her and Dean as children, but cannot recall ever knowing Dean before high school. Kris begins to dream about the burned man herself and refuses to go to sleep for fear that she will die in her dreams. Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker), Kris's ex-boyfriend, shows up to keep her company while she sleeps, but Kris meets the burned man in her dreams and is murdered.

5|$|Outside Tsubasa, Sakura makes various {{appearances}} in Clamp's manga xxxHolic, showing {{some of the}} events happening in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle. Sakura also appears in later volumes when her soul is separated from her body {{and sent to the}} Dream World.

One of her feathers – that of her memories of Syaoran – appears in Watanuki's world and gives the medium Kohane Tsuyuri the ability to exorcise spirits. After Kohane wishes for the removal of her ability, the feather stays with a black Mokona Modoki. Sakura does not appear in the animated adaptions of xxxHolic until the original video animations series xxxHolic Shunmuki, in which she appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> World talking with Watanuki.|$|E

25|$|Fritz Perls {{presented}} {{his theory of}} dreams {{as part of the}} holistic nature of Gestalt therapy. Dreams are seen as projections of parts of the self that have been ignored, rejected, or suppressed. Jung argued that one could consider every person <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dream</b> to represent an aspect of the dreamer, which he called the subjective approach to dreams. Perls expanded this point of view to say that even inanimate objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dream</b> may represent aspects of the dreamer. The dreamer may, therefore, be asked to imagine being an object <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dream</b> and to describe it, in order to bring into awareness the characteristics of the object that correspond with the dreamer's personality.|$|E
