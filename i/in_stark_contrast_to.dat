5|$|This is <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> {{the stance}} taken by his predecessor, Clinton, whose {{approach}} {{and response to}} India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{received}} a chilly reception from the audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, although {{some in the}} audience, such as Scalia, laughed heartily as Colbert teased them.

The Congo was therefore administered from London by the Belgian government in exile during the war.|$|E
5|$|At {{the lowest}} level of the façade is a plain base, {{contrasting}} with and stabilising the ornate arcades that rise above it. The base is penetrated by three doors, which are <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the often imposing portals of French Gothic cathedrals. The outer two are of domestic proportion and the central door is ornamented only by a central post, quatrefoil and the fine mouldings of the arch.|$|E
5|$|However, the bathhouse of {{the spirits}} cannot {{be seen as a}} place free of {{ambiguity}} and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. <b>In</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E

40|$|Sustainability is {{currently}} the term dominating environmental policy. Its extensive political diffusion is <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast,</b> however, <b>to</b> {{the extent to which}} there is agreement over its meaning. Its ability to motivate is not in question, but a certain scepticism surrounds its ideological content. Since ideological terms have no objective basis, it is therefore important for the purposes of environmental policy to establish whether such scepticism is justified...|$|R

5|$|Some of the {{characteristic}} traits of Kim's mature style, first seen {{in these three}} films, are gothic excess, surrealism, horror, perversions and sexuality. Although <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the realism, harmony, balance and sentimentality typical of Korean cinema of the time, Kim's films, in an eccentric and metaphorical way, deal {{with the realities of}} postwar, industrializing South Korean society and psychology. After having firmly established his auteur status with these films, Kim's unique vision began to wane in his films of the later 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the film portray demon-like and other fictional creatures {{as part of the}} Persian army, and the fictionalized {{portrayal}} of Persian King Xerxes I has been criticized as effeminate. Critics suggested that this was meant to stand <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the sheer masculinity of the Spartan army. Steven Rea argued that the film's Persians were a vehicle for an anachronistic cross-section of Western stereotypes of Asian and African cultures.|$|E
5|$|The Empire's {{successful}} navigation {{of these}} crises considerably enhanced the nation's stability and prestige, and Brazil {{emerged as a}} hemispheric power. Internationally, Europeans began to regard the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals, such as {{freedom of the press}} and constitutional respect for civil liberties. Its representative parliamentary monarchy also stood <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the mix of dictatorships and instability endemic in the other nations of South America during this period.|$|E

50|$|These high {{expectations}} quickly evaporated. The Athletics stumbled {{out of the}} gate (winning just two of their first dozen games); while their play nominally improved over {{the first half of the}} season, they failed to build upon the momentum of their division-winning 2000 campaign. The rival Seattle Mariners, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast,</b> raced <b>to</b> a historic 52-14 start. As expected, the offense performed well; Oakland was instead hamstrung by unexpectedly terrible starting pitching. At the season's midpoint, the A's boasted a sub-.500 record (39-42); they trailed the division-leading Mariners by some 21 games.|$|R
5|$|The Welsh {{performance}} during the 1893 Home Nations Championship was <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the previous year. Under the captaincy of Gould, Wales not only won the Championship {{for the first}} time, but also the Triple Crown. The first match of the campaign was against England, and played at the Cardiff Arms Park. The pitch had been kept from freezing over the night before by 500 braziers dispersed across the playing field. This led to a slippery ground, with play further hampered by a strong wind.|$|E
5|$|The loud goose-like honking call is a {{familiar}} sound, particularly during the breeding season; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry {{on for some time}} when perched. The male's call is higher-pitched and more rapid than that of the female. Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E
5|$|The other 10% {{of cases}} are {{primarily}} caused by primary hyperplasia, or {{an increase of}} the number of cells. Parathyroid carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of all cases, occurring most frequently in individuals around 50 years of age (<b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> OFC as a result of primary hyperparathyroidism) and showing no gender preference. Approximately 95% of hyperparatyhroidism caused by genetic factors is attributed to MEN type 1. This mutation also tends to affect younger individuals.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Espanyol {{was seen}} by the vast {{majority}} of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> Barça's revolutionary spirit. Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{opportunity}} to rebuild their strength, the German Army in the West was able to accumulate a strength of around 500 tanks and assault guns by late September, despite prioritization of new equipment for the Eastern Front. This was <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the estimated 100 which had been available before. German defenses along the Siegfried Line continued to strengthen, and the Wehrmacht was able to establish a defensive depth of an average of , with the strongest defenses built opposite of Patton's Third Army.|$|E

2500|$|Wilfred Edward Salter Owen, MC (18 March 1893– 4 November 1918) was an English {{poet and}} soldier, {{one of the}} leading poets of the First World War. His war poetry on the horrors of {{trenches}} and gas warfare was heavily influenced by his mentor Siegfried Sassoon, and stood <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> both <b>to</b> the public perception of war at the time and to the confidently patriotic verse written by earlier war poets such as Rupert Brooke.

5|$|Cecil B. DeMille {{released}} This Day and Age in 1933, and {{it stands}} <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> his other {{films of the}} period. Filmed shortly after DeMille had completed a five-month tour of the Soviet Union, This Day and Age takes place in America and features several children torturing a gangster who got away {{with the murder of}} a popular local shopkeeper. The youngsters are seen lowering the gangster into a vat of rats when the police arrive, and their response is to encourage the youths to continue this. The film ends with the youngsters taking the gangster to a local judge and forcing the magistrate to conduct a trial in which the outcome is never in doubt.|$|E
5|$|In Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, the group's {{style was}} moving towards art rock, being {{influenced}} by the bands Blur, Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine.

40|$|Quantum {{coherence}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} intriguing applications of quantum mechanics, and has led to interesting phenomena and uncommon results. Here we show that <b>in</b> a <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the usual red-detuned condition to observe bistability in single-mode optomechanics, the optical intensities exhibit bistability for all values of cavity-laser detuning due to intermode coupling induced by the two-photon coherence. Interestingly, an unconventional bistability with "ribbon"-shaped hysteresis can be observed for blue-detuned laser frequencies. We also demonstrate that the two-photon coherence leads to a strong entanglement between the movable mirrors in the adiabatic regime. Surprisingly, the mirror-mirror entanglement is shown to persist for environment temperature of the phonon bath up to 12 K using experimental parameters.
