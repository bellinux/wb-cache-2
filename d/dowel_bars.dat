This involves cutting slots in the pavement at each joint, placing <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> in the slots, then filling them with concrete patching material.

50|$|In {{contemporary}} highway construction {{since the}} mid-1990s, <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> {{are once again}} placed across joints and at intervals along the pavement. Today, <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> are coated with epoxy to prevent the corrosion problems seen in earlier installations.|$|E
50|$|Many {{states are}} {{retrofitting}} older highways with epoxy-coated <b>dowel</b> <b>bars.</b> The retrofit begins with cutting of six slots (three in each wheel path) across all transverse joints or cracks. The slots are cut with ganged diamond saws that make six cuts in each wheel path. The concrete between the saw cuts is then removed with lightweight jackhammers (heavy-weight jackhammers tend {{to damage the}} concrete around the cuts). The epoxy-coated <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> are placed in the slots, then the slots are filled with grout and the joints or cracks are filled with waterproof caulk. The final step is to diamond-grind the joint to remove both excess grout and any displacement of the panels.|$|E

The dowels {{need to be}} smooth, round, epoxy and made of bond breaker coated steel conforming to requirements. The bond breaker {{is to be applied}} on all surfaces of the <b>dowel</b> <b>bar.</b> The expansion caps belong {{at each end of the}} <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> and the <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> support chairs are used to firmly hold the dowels centered in the slots during backfill operations. The foam core insert is used to re-establish the joint or crack, which allows the bar within each side of the slot to expand and contract. The caulking filler is used to prevent backfill material from flowing into the joint or crack. Non-shrink concrete backfill material that is tested as rapid set concrete patching materials is recommended for use on DBR projects.|$|R

5000|$|This was {{discontinued}} {{because the}} <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> tended to corrode and required frequent replacement. Stainless steel <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> are {{more resistant to}} corrosion, but stainless steel is relatively expensive compared to other materials. Instead, for several decades, the cohesion between the panels {{and the strength of}} the roadbed was relied upon to collectively distribute the load from one panel to the next, a concept known as aggregate interlock. Over time the joints and roadbed tended to break down under stress, resulting in cracks and displacement of the panels. Most highways in the United States built as part of the Interstate Highway System from the 1950s to the 1980s relied solely upon aggregate interlock and began to show problems in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E

Finally, diamond grind the pavement surface within 30 working days of dowel bar retrofit placement.|$|E
50|$|Traffic {{loadings}} {{are transferred}} between sections when larger aggregates in the PCC mix inter-lock together, or through load transfer devices in the transverse joints of the surface. <b>Dowel</b> <b>bars</b> {{are used as}} load-transferring devices to efficiently transfer loads across transverse joints while maintaining the joint's horizontal and vertical alignment.

30|$|No {{restraints}} {{were considered}} for the concrete slab {{to allow for the}} possible loss of contact due to temperature differentials in the slab by modeling the unbonded interface condition between the concrete slab and the subgrade layer using contact and target elements. The slab contact with the subgrade layer was only retained by the self-weight of the slab. The interface model was also capable of capturing the effect of friction, and a value of 1.5 for coefficient of friction was assumed in the FE model. Also, the surface condition between <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> and surrounding slab was also modeled using the contact surface with a value 0.6 for a coefficient of friction. The <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> was confined by the slab weight and then was allowed to slide when the force to pull the <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> was greater than confined force in the surface of <b>dowel</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{final step}} often {{involves}} diamond-grinding {{of the entire}} road surface to remove any bumps or dips. Without the <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> retrofit this grinding {{would have to be}} repeated every six to eight years, but it is predicted that the retrofit will greatly increase this interval. <b>Dowel</b> <b>Bar</b> Retrofit has been proven to outlast Asphalt Overlay by at least ten years, and significantly improves ride quality.|$|R
50|$|A {{dowel bar}} {{retrofit}} (DBR) {{is a method}} of reinforcing cracks in highway pavement by inserting steel <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> in slots cut across the cracks. It is a technique several states have successfully used to address faulting in older jointed plain concrete pavements. The typical approach is to saw cut and jackhammer out the slots for the dowels. Following dowel placement the slots are then typically backfilled with a non-shrink concrete mixture (grout) and the pavement is diamond-ground to restore smoothness.|$|E
50|$|Remove {{existing}} concrete {{from the}} slots {{followed by the}} cleaning out of all debris. Use maximum weight 30 pound jackhammers to remove the concrete remaining between the saw cuts. If the concrete removal operations cause damage to the pavement that is to remain, discontinue concrete removal operations and only resume after taking corrective measures. During concrete removal operations, use a small bush hammer as necessary to produce a flat, level surface within the slot so the backfill flows and consolidates under the <b>dowel</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As {{a vehicle}} travels on jointed {{concrete}} roads {{the weight of}} the vehicle passes from one concrete panel to the next. As the vehicle traverses the joints its weight is placed {{on the edge of the}} panel, where the panel is least able to withstand the deflection force. This can cause cracks as pavement shears off the edge of the panel. On older highways built in the early-to-mid 20th century, <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> (steel rods) were placed across the joints to help transfer the load from one panel to the next.|$|E

50|$|Maintenance for {{the older}} {{concrete}} pavements that develop faults includes the technique called dowel bar retrofit. This involves cutting slots in the pavement at each joint, placing <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> in the slots, then filling them with concrete patching material. This method can {{extend the life of}} the concrete pavement for another 15 years. Failure to maintain roads properly can create significant costs to society, in a 2009 report released by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (USA) about 50% of the roads in the USA are in bad condition with urban areas worse. The report estimates that urban drivers pay an average of $746/year on vehicle repairs while the average US motorist pays about $335/year. In contrast, the average motorist pays about $171/year in road maintenance taxes (based on 600 gallons/year and $0.285/gallon tax).|$|E
50|$|Three main {{types of}} {{concrete}} pavements commonly used are Jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP), jointed reinforced concrete pavement (JRCP), and {{continuously reinforced concrete}} pavements (CRCP). JPCP’s are constructed with contraction joints which direct the natural cracking of the pavement. These pavements do not use any reinforcing steel. JRCP’s are constructed with both contraction joints and reinforcing steel to control the cracking of the pavement. High temperatures and moisture stresses within the pavement creates cracking, which the reinforcing steel holds tightly together. At transverse joints, <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> are typically placed to assist with transferring the load of the vehicle across the cracking. CRCP’s solely rely on continuous reinforcing steel to hold the pavement’s natural transverse cracks together. Prestressed concrete pavements have also {{been used in the}} construction of highways; however, they are not as common as the other three. Prestressed pavements allow for a thinner slab thickness by partly or wholly neutralizing thermally induced stresses or loadings.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dowel</b> <b>bar</b> retrofits, if done badly, {{can cause}} serious {{problems}}. These problems are usually due to poor workmanship {{and can be}} avoided by careful following of specifications and close supervision of workers. Use of heavy jackhammers (heavier than 14 kg class) tends to cause cracking of the concrete all around the slots. Lack of caulk or voids in the caulk put in the joints or cracks leads to cracks around the joints. Voids in the grout (especially below the <b>dowel</b> <b>bar)</b> can cause failure of the grout.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{restoring}} load transfer in existing concrete pavements through {{the installation of}} mechanical devices at transverse joints or cracks began in the United States in the early 1980 s. A number of devices have been evaluated for their effectiveness in restoring load transfer and reducing the return of joint faulting. <b>Dowel</b> <b>bar</b> retrofit {{has been shown to}} be effective in restor-ing load transfer and minimizing the return of faulting.

40|$|Jointed plain {{concrete}} pavements use <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> to transfer load across transverse joints. The {{job of the}} designer is to optimize the number, size, and location of the dowels in a given pavement. This research used data from two different construction locations. The first project evaluated the performance of standard 1. 5 inch round and elliptical shaped <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> at different spacing intervals using full dowel baskets. The performance potential of standard 1. 5 inch round and elliptical dowels placed in the wheel paths only was also evaluated on the same project. The second project compared corrosion resistant dowel bar (stainless steel and {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) <b>dowel</b> <b>bars)</b> performance to round 1. 5 inch epoxy-coated steel <b>dowel</b> <b>bars.</b> The stainless steel and GFRP bars are for possible use in environments where steel corrosion may be an issue. Performance data was measured on both projects in terms of deflections, using falling weight deflectometer (FWD) data collected biannually. Joint faulting data was collected over the five-year test period for both projects. Roughness data was collected for only the elliptical dowel bar project over the five-year test period. Resilient modulus values were found by triaxial testing of the pavement subgrade samples. Performance criteria graphed verses resilient modulus allowed for the comparison of different dowels as the subgrade resilient modulus changed. The elliptical dowel bar study indicated medium elliptical <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> at 12 inch or 15 inch spacing perform equally to the standard 1. 5 inch round <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> at 12 inch spacing. The elliptical study also indicated the potential use of medium elliptical <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> in wheel paths only.

30|$|<b>Dowel</b> <b>bars</b> are {{commonly}} used in jointed plain concrete pavements (JPCP) as a load transfer device across joints, especially for pavements with heavy traffic. The primary advantage of <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> is to transfer load without restricting horizontal joint movements due to temperature and moisture expansion and contraction in the concrete slabs. Also, <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> play a role to maintain the vertical and horizontal alignment of slabs. The load transfer efficiency depends {{on a number of}} dowel-joint parameters, including modulus of dowel support, dowel bar diameter, dowel length, dowel bar spacing, dowel looseness, joint opening width, and subgrade strength (Channakeshava et al. 1993; Guo et al. 1993; Brill and Guo 2000; Kim and Hjelmstad 2003; Maitra et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|Effective load {{transfer}} across Portland cement concrete pavement joints significantly decreases pavement deterioration. <b>Dowel</b> <b>bars</b> placed transversely across a joint or crack provide {{a mechanism for}} effective {{load transfer}} to take place. <b>Dowel</b> <b>bars</b> are used in new construction as well as retrofitted into existing pavements for restoration of load transfer. Areas of concern with using <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> include high costs, due to the labor-intensive procedure of retrofitting, and corrosion associated with standard mild steel epoxy-coated dowels.

A 3 D {{finite element}} model is used to {{investigate}} the state of load stress developed in concrete pavement with <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> under the effect of typical pavement damages of pumping area of slab corner and pumping area of transverse joints edge. The results indicate that slab corner stress tends to decrease {{with the increase of}} slab thickness and possesses a nonlinear growth as pumping area increases; when the pumping area of slab corner is less than 1. 5 m× 1. 5 m, the maximum pavement slab tensile stress is less than or close to the load stress in critical loading position. Stress in transverse joints edge also grows in a nonlinear tendency and axle load also grows gradually with the expansion of pumping area, of which the slope of the curve in the relationship between stress and void size is much greater.
