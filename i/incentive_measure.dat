30|$|To {{properly}} evaluate {{how social}} security incentives affect {{the choice between}} alternative retirement routes we study the impact that delta social security wealth has on each hazard rate. Remember from Sect.  4.2 that this <b>incentive</b> <b>measure</b> provides an assessment about how much partial retirement exceeds full retirement in terms of SSW. Table  5 reports {{the results of the}} estimation where we only include as social security incentives the DSSW and the SSA. As we can observe, the DSSW has the expected sign and its coefficient is statistically significant. DSSW affects negatively the hazard rate to full retirement and positively the hazard rate to partial retirement.|$|E

These findings suggest that forward-looking measures of economic incentives do influence retirement decisions {{but only in the}} case of partial retirement. So, full retirement decisions could be postponed 1  year but no more than this. However, the assumption that the maximum full retirement age allowed is 66 could reduce the potential strength of the peak value as an <b>incentive</b> <b>measure.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{evolutionary}} game model between manufacturers {{is established}} {{to study the}} influence of government <b>incentive</b> <b>measures</b> for the EOL product recovery {{based on the assumption}} that all manufacturers have bounded rationality. Analysis on stable state shows that the evolutionary stable state does not always exist in the model. On the basis of this analysis, a system dynamics model is established to analyze the influence of the lowest recovery ratio and the fixed reward on the recovery behaviors of manufacturers by simulation. Simulation results illustrate that there exists a reasonable range of the lowest recovery ratio within which government <b>incentive</b> <b>measures</b> work well and the fixed reward can expand the width of the reasonable range. Any above or below the reasonable range of the lowest recovery ratio will invalidate government <b>incentive</b> <b>measures.</b> Government should enhance the degree of the lowest recovery ratio in the below situation, and provide manufacturers with greater amounts of reward for their product recovery actions in the above situation...|$|R

The direct relationship between the unemployment rate of {{the young and the}} labor force participation of the old is pro-cyclical, i. e. a higher labor force participation of the old is related to a lower unemployment rate of the young. Hence both vary with the business cycle. In order to overcome endogeneity problems in explaining unemployment of the young, we resort to a simulated variable: “the inducement to retire”, which is constructed by simulating the social security benefits. We related the unemployment rate of the young to this <b>incentive</b> <b>measure</b> and find that a higher inducement to retire is associated to a higher unemployment rate – quite the opposite of the “young-in-old-out” story. lump of labour, youth unemployment, early retirement...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to examine two {{commonly}} used alternatives to traditional repricing (TR) of executive stock options (ESOs) in a dynamic agency model. TR practices have become obsolete since new accounting rules took effect in July 2000. To avoid associated variable accounting charges that cause uncertainty in future reported earnings, companies have tried several TR alternatives as solutions to rescuing underwater options. We justify the occurrence of TR alternatives and quantify the impact of the marking-to-market feature imbedded in the new accounting rules. We also propose an <b>incentive</b> <b>measure</b> which is comparable to the subjective value of ESOs claimed by Ingersoll, J (2006) to rank TR alternatives in terms of agent's incentive.

40|$|This paper uses {{administrative}} data {{to study the}} retirement decisions of Italian privatesector non-agricultural employees during the period 1977 — 1997. Our analysis tries to assess {{the importance of the}} financial incentives built into the social security system. The basic idea is very simple: at any given age, and based on the available information, workers compare theexpected present value of two alternatives: retiring today or working one more year, and then choose the best one. A key role in this kind of comparisons is played by social security wealth, whose level and changes reflect the expectations about the profile of future earnings and the institutional features of the social security system. The various <b>incentive</b> <b>measures</b> that we consider diﬀer in the precise weight given to the social security wealth that workers accrue as they continue to work. Our model does not provide a structural representation of the retirement process. A worker’s decision is modeled here following a “quasi reduced-form” approach, with the <b>incentive</b> <b>measures</b> entering as predictors of the worker’s choice in addition to standard variables. The estimated models are then used to predict retirement probabilities under alternative policies that change social security wealth and derived <b>incentive</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R
30|$|Calculation of SSW {{and related}} <b>incentive</b> <b>measures</b> depends crucially on the {{following}} elements: the legislation which applies at each moment in time, the individual history of contributions, the consumer price index, minimum and maximum contribution bases, minimum and maximum retirement pensions and mortality tables.|$|R
3000|$|With {{respect to}} the first <b>incentive</b> <b>measure</b> and for the case of full retirement, SSA F affects {{negatively}} the hazard rate to full retirement, as expected. The larger the SSA F, the less the individual brings forward full retirement. It {{must be noted that}} the negative impact of SSA F [...] on the hazard rate to full retirement becomes positive at 65  years of age. That is, at the age of 65 the increase in SSW F [...] one can obtain by postponing 1  year full retirement has a positive impact on its own hazard rate. Even if the postponement of full retirement is awarded through greater SSA F, there exists a reluctance to remain in the labour market at the age of 65. In relation to the SSA P [...] it influences the hazard rate to partial retirement negatively, as expected.|$|E
40|$|I {{investigate}} the incentive effects of disability pensions on the labour supply decision. The {{implicit tax rate}} on further work is included as a forward looking <b>incentive</b> <b>measure</b> in order to {{investigate the}} effect of disability benefits on disability retirement entry as a special type of early retirement. A substantial change of the disability pension legislation caused exogenous variation in disability benefits in Germany in 2001 and is used to obtain estimates of individual’s responses to financial incentives. Benefit levels appear to {{have no effect on}} the labour market behaviour. At the same time, there is a sizable and significant disincentive effect of implicit taxes on labour market income, indicating that alleviating such disincentives would likely increase labour force participation. Since the response to financial incentives occurs mainly among those in good health, such a policy might on the other hand imperil the aim of providing insurance against a health induced loss of ones working capacity.

40|$|Two of {{the most}} widely tested {{predictions}} of agency theory are that there exists a negative association between an agent’s pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) and the risk of output, and that PPS, which is a measure of incentive, enhances performance. Empirical evidence has been mixed. This paper develops a model that introduces a “wealth effect ” and also allows the agent to control the risk of output. In doing so, the paper proposes a utility function that has not been employed in the literature. The paper shows that the two predictions, which are formulated in the absence of both wealth effects and endogenous risk, may not hold. Specifically, PPS can be either positively or negatively related to risk, and a higher PPS does not necessarily lead to a higher expected profit for the principal. In other words, even under the linear contract space, PPS is not a sufficient predictor for an agent’s actions and performance. The paper thus presents the need for a new <b>incentive</b> <b>measure</b> that incorporates both PPS and constant compensation. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unified {{framework for understanding}} the determinants of both CEO incentives and total pay levels in competitive market equilibrium. It embeds a modified principal-agent problem into a talent assignment model to endogenize both elements of compensation. The model's closed form solutions yield testable predictions for how incentives should vary across firms under optimal contracting. In particular, our calibrations show that the negative relationship between the CEO's effective equity stake and firm size is quantitatively consistent with efficiency and need not reflect rent extraction. Our model and data both also imply that the dollar change in wealth for a percentage change in firm value, scaled by annual pay, is independent of firm size. This may render it an attractive <b>incentive</b> <b>measure</b> as it is comparable between firms and over time. The theory also predicts {{a positive relationship between}} pay volatility and firm volatility, and that risk and effort affect total pay along the cross-section but not in the aggregate. Finally, we demonstrate that incentive compensation is effective at solving large agency problems, such as selecting corporate strategy, but smaller issues such as perk consumption are best addressed through direct monitoring. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The Chinese {{government}} takes {{measures to}} promote the development of green building (GB). But until 2013, there are only few green buildings in China. The real estate developers are skeptical in entering GB market, which requires theories to explain developers and government’s behaviors. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, we attempt Evolutionary game theory and System dynamics (SD) into the analysis. A system dynamics model is built for studying evolutionary games {{between the government and}} developers in greening building decision making. Findings and Originality/value: The results of mixed-strategy stability analysis and SD simulation show that evolutionary equilibrium does not exist with a static government incentive. Therefore, a dynamical incentive is suggested in the SD model for promoting the green building market. The symmetric game and asymmetric game between two developers show, if the primary proportion who choose GB strategy is lower, all the group in game may finally evolve to GB strategy. In this case and in this time, the government should take measures to encourage developers to enter into the GB market. If the proportion who choose GB strategy is high enough, the government should gradually cancel or reduce those <b>incentive</b> <b>measure.</b> Research limitations/implications: an Evolution Analysis and System Dynamics Simulation on Behaviors of Real Estate Developers and Government could give some advice for the government {{to promote the}} green building market. </p...|$|E

40|$|The CDM Executive Board {{recently}} took a positive decision on programmatic CDM, {{also known as}} a CDM Programme of Activities. This prompts the author to present a new tool that has been developed recently for the Thai electricity market. The Renewable Energy Development (RED) Model, initially developed in the framework of the DANIDA funded project: Promotion of Renewable Energy in Thailand (PRET), at the Ministry of Energy of Thailand, was designed for the modelling of different incentive schemes and their effects on the Thai power system for the promotion of renewable energy technologies (RETs). Within this article, an extension of the existing RED model, including the CDM as additional <b>incentive</b> <b>measure,</b> is presented (RED-CDM). Along with the project-based approach, also a sectoral and programmatic approach is included as well. Several scenarios developed with the RED-CDM model show the influence of different incentive mechanisms on the Thai power market and their potentials for reaching the policy targets stated in the Energy Strategy of Thailand for Competitiveness. The main results show that reaching the policy targets is possible, while the price can be extremely high if the targets are to be achieved on schedule. Another important result is that a sectoral CDM approach could help financing about 20 % of the incentives needed for a shift towards a more sustainable power grid, if the certified emission reductions (CERs) are sold at a price of 15 Euro/ton. ...|$|E
