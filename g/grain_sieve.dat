40|$|The water {{relations}} parameters {{involved in}} assimilate flow into developing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grains were measured at several points from the flag leaf to the endosperm cavity in normally watered (Ψ ≈ − 0. 3 MPa) and water-stressed plants (Ψ ≈ − 2 MPa). These included direct measurement of sieve tube turgor and several independent {{approaches to the}} measurement or calculation of water potentials in the peduncle, grain pericarp, and endosperm cavity. Sieve tube turgor measurements, osmotic concentrations, and Ψ measurements using dextran microdrops showed good internal consistency (i. e. Ψ = Ψs + Ψp) from 0 to − 4 MPa. In normally watered plants, crease pericarp Ψ and sieve tube turgor were almost 1 MPa lower than in the peduncle. This suggests a high hydraulic resistance in the sieve tubes connecting the two. However, observations concerning exudation rates indicated a low resistance. In water-stressed plants, peduncle Ψ and crease pericarp Ψ were similar. In both treatments, there was a variable, approximately 1 -MPa drop in turgor pressure between the <b>grain</b> <b>sieve</b> tubes and vascular parenchyma cells. There was little between-treatment difference in endosperm cavity sucrose or osmotic concentrations or in the crease pericarp sucrose pool size.

Sieve tube exudate was collected from severed aphid stylets established on the peduncle and rachis {{and on the}} vascular bundles in the creases of grains. Phloem exudate could also be collected from broken grain pedicels, and by puncturing the vascular bundle in the grain crease with a needle. Stylets on excised grains persisted exuding, indicating that <b>grain</b> <b>sieve</b> tubes are capable of loading solutes. There was little, if any, discernible gradient in osmolality or solute composition (sucrose, total amino acids) of sieve tube contents along the phloem pathway from the peduncle to the rachis or along the rachis itself. Neither was a gradient detected in osmolality along the sieve tube pathway from the rachis through the rachilla and grain stalk to the crease. Demonstrable solute gradients occurred only across those tissues of the grain crease between the crease sieve tubes and the endosperm cavity, a distance of just 1 millimeter. However, while the sucrose concentration in the sieve tubes was almost tenfold that in the endosperm cavity sap, total amino acids were only threefold higher, and the potassium concentrations of the two were equal. Our observations strongly implicate the movement of assimilates from the sieve tubes and across the crease tissues as important control points in grain filling...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{economically}} desalinate seawater in arid {{regions of the}} world has become a vital advancement to overcome the problem on freshwater availability, quality, and reliability. In contrast with the major capital and operational costs for desalination plants represented by conventional open ocean intakes, subsurface intakes allow the extraction of high quality feed water at minimum costs and reduced environmental impact. A seabed filter is a subsurface intake that consists of a submerged slow sand filter, with benefits of organic matter removal and pathogens, and low operational cost. A site investigation was carried out through the southern coast of the Red Sea in Saudi Arabia, from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology down to 370 kilometers south of Jeddah. A site adjacent to the Shoaiba desalination plant was selected to assess the viability of constructing a seabed filter. <b>Grain</b> <b>sieve</b> size analysis, porosity and hydraulic conductivity permeameter measurements were performed on the collected sediment samples. Based on these results, it was concluded that the characteristics at the Shoaiba site allow {{for the construction of a}} seabed filtration system. A seabed filter design is proposed for the 150, 000 m 3 /d Shoaiba III expansion project, a large-scale Reverse Osmosis desalination plant. A filter design with a filtration rate of 7 m/d through an area of 6, 000 m 2 is proposed to meet the demand of one of the ten desalination trains operating at the plant. The filter would be located 90 meters offshore where hydraulic conductivity of the sediment is high, and mud percentage is minimal. The thin native marine sediment layer is insufficient to provide enough water filtration, and consequently the proposed solution involves excavating the limestone rock and filling it with different layers of non-native sand and gravel of increasing grain size. An initial assessment of the area around Shoaiba showed similar sedimentological conditions that could lead into the application of comparable seabed filter design concepts to supply the entire feed water requirement of the plant. Considerations for the construction of a seabed filter should include technical feasibility and life cycle assessment, i. e. capital costs, operating costs and environmental impacts...|$|E

40|$|We have {{initiated}} {{a major new}} program to determine the grain size distribution of nearly all lunar soils collected in the Apollo program. Following the return of Apollo soil and core samples, a number of investigators including our own group performed grain size distribution studies and published the results [1 - 11]. Nearly all of these studies were done by sieving the samples, usually with a working fluid such as Freon(TradeMark) or water. We have measured the particle size distribution of lunar soil 10084, 2005 in water, using a Microtrac(TradeMark) laser diffraction instrument. Details of our own sieving technique and protocol (also used in [11]). are given in [4]. While sieving usually produces accurate and reproducible results, it has disadvantages. It is very labor intensive and requires hours to days to perform properly. Even using automated sieve shaking devices, {{four or five days}} may be needed to sieve each sample, although multiple sieve stacks increases productivity. Second, sieving is subject to loss of grains through handling and weighing operations, and these losses are concentrated in the finest grain sizes. Loss from handling becomes a more acute problem when smaller amounts of material are used. While we were able to quantitatively sieve into 6 or 8 size fractions using starting soil masses as low as 50 mg, attrition and handling problems limit the practicality of sieving smaller amounts. Third, sieving below 10 or 20 microns is not practical because of the problems of grain loss, and smaller grains sticking to coarser <b>grains.</b> <b>Sieving</b> is completely impractical below about 5 - 10 microns. Consequently, sieving gives no information on the size distribution below approx. 10 microns which includes the important submicrometer and nanoparticle size ranges. Finally, sieving creates a limited number of size bins and may therefore miss fine structure of the distribution which would be revealed by other methods that produce many smaller size bins...|$|R

The finest grain size fractions occurred within ripple troughs and in the subsurface, and typically exhibited the strongest ~ 530 [*]nm bands, highest relative reflectances, and weakest red/near-infrared ratios, consistent {{with a combination of}} crystalline and amorphous ferric materials. Coarser-grained samples were the darkest and bluest, and exhibited weaker ~ 530 [*]nm bands, lower relative reflectances, and stronger downturns in the near-infrared, consistent with greater proportions of mafic minerals such as olivine and pyroxene. These grains were typically segregated along ripple crests and among the upper surfaces of grain flows in disturbed sands. Sieved dune sands exhibited progressive decreases in reflectance with increasing grain size, as observed in laboratory spectra of olivine size separates. The continuum of spectral features observed between the coarse- and fine-grained dune sands suggests that mafic grains, ferric materials, and airfall dust mix in variable proportions depending on aeolian activity and grain sorting...|$|R

They are low cost versatile raw materials for the building industry. A mineral survey led {{to the discovery of}} clay occurrences along the highway Libreville-Cocoa-beach from Mezafe to Mengono (NE Libreville). These clays were characterized by chemical analyses, <b>grain</b> size distribution (<b>sieving,</b> sedimentometry and Fraunhofer laser light scattering), plasticity, X-ray diffraction on crude powder and oriented fine fractions (natural, glycolated or heated at 550 degrees C), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, adsorption-desorption of nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, and scanning electron microscopy. Samples were fired from 900 to 1150 degrees C and a few properties such as water absorption, linear shrinkage and bending strength were determined. Mineralogically, raw clay samples are made up mainly of quartz, kaolinite, illite and chlorite. Accessories are orthoclase, anatase, ilmenite, magnetite, goethite, lepidocrocite, Fe-Al sulfate, La-Ce rich crandallite or a mineral likely related to Ce-belovite, pyrite, Cu-Fe rich silicate, carbonates, bitumen and other organic matters. The decrease of SiO 2 contents and the increase of Al 2 O 3 contents of fractions under 125 mu m suggest the presence of large size quartz grains and fine kaolinite particles. The sum kaolinite + illite + chlorite increases from 25 - 42 % in crude samples to 37 - 48 % in clay fractions (135 mu m) with an increment rate of 15 - 40 % at Mezafe and above 50 % at Mengono. Thus, screening only can yield clay-rich raw materials similar to some European commercial kaolins. Results of firing from 900 to 1150 degrees C show that water absorption, linear shrinkage and bending strength values are in the norm of tiles and fired earth. Only one sample's properties need to be enhanced for terra-cotta production...|$|R

The analyzed lunar samples are thin sections 64002, 6019 (5. 0 - 8. 0 cm depth) and 64001, 6031 (50. 0 - 53. 1 cm depth) and <b>sieved</b> <b>grain</b> mounts 64002, 262 and 64001, 374 from depths {{corresponding to the}} thin sections, respectively. We also analyzed lunar highland regolith simulants NU-LHT- 1 M, - 2 M, and OB- 1, low-Ti mare simulants JSC- 1, -lA, - 1 AF, and FJS- 1, and high-Ti mare simulant MLS- 1. The preliminary results comprise {{the beginning of an}} internally consistent database of lunar regolith and regolith simulant mineral and glass information. This database, combined with previous and concurrent studies on phase chemistry, bulk chemistry, and with data on particle shape and size distribution, will serve to guide lunar scientists and engineers in choosing simulants for their applications. These results are modal% by phase rather than by particle type, so they are not directly comparable to most previously published lunar data that report lithic fragments, monomineralic particles, agglutinates, etc. Of the highland simulants, 08 - 1 has an integrated modal composition closer than NU-LHT- 1 M to that of the 64001 / 2 samples, However, this and other studies show that NU-LHT- 1 M and - 2 M have minor and trace mineral (e. g., Fe-Ti oxides and phosphates) populations and mineral and glass chemistry closer to these lunar samples. The finest fractions (0 - 20 microns) in the sieved lunar samples are enriched in glass relative to the integrated compositions by approx. 30 % for 64002, 262 and approx. 15 % for 64001, 374. Plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine are depleted in these finest fractions. This could be important to lunar dust mitigation efforts and astronaut health - none of the analyzed simulants show this trend. Contrary to previously reported modal analyses of monomineralic grains in lunar regolith, these area% modal analyses do not show a systematic increase in plagiociase/pyroxene as size fraction decreases...|$|R

Utilizou-se um silo metálico com 12, 5 t de trigo tipo durum, da safra de setembro/ 1998. Durante o carregamento do silo, o trigo foi infestado com S. zeamais, de tal forma que obtivesse 1 inseto kg- 1 de grãos. Em intervalos de oito dias e por um período de três meses, realizou-se uma amostragem em três profundidades do silo. Depois de pesadas, as amostras eram peneiradas para retirada dos insetos. Para caracterizar o tipo de distribuição populacional de Sitophilus, foram comparadas três técnicas: "Iwao’s patchiness", "Taylor’s power law" e índice de Morisita. Embora a técnica de Iwao e a de Taylor tenham caracterizado o mesmo tipo de distribuição, optou-se pela de Iwao por ser a menos influenciada pelo tamanho da amostra, localização e intervalos de amostragem. O cálculo do número de amostras baseou-se no número médio de insetos por amostra coletada e, pelos resultados obtidos, concluiu-se que, quanto maior o número de insetos por quilograma de grãos, menor a quantidade de amostras necessárias.

In order to characterize the type of the distribution of the Sitophilus population, three techniques were used: Iwao’s patchness, Taylor’s power law and Morisita’s index. Despite Iwao’s and Taylor’s techniques providing the same distribution characterization, Iwao’s technique was preferred because it is less affected by sample size, location and sampling intervals. The determination of the number of samples was based on the mean number of insects collected per sample.

40|$|Relationships between <b>sieve</b> <b>grain</b> {{size and}} thin section grain size have been {{determined}} empirically {{from the study}} of 72 artificially created sendstone samples. Modern sands were sieved into size fractions, which were recombined in a log normal distribution to give samples with a range of means and standard deviations, but with similar individual grain properties. Sample splits of these were impregnated with resin, and the size distribution of grain long axes selected by point counter in thin section was compared with that found by sieving the remaining sample. This method attempts to minimise the effects of factors that influence apparent size in thin section. The results have been compared with those of (1958, 1962) who studied the same size relationships in 38 natural sandstones, e. g. This work: Sieve size from Folk = 1. 078 (thin section mean) + 0. 200 phi graphical mean 1 / 3 (Ø 16 +Ø 50 +Ø 84) Friedman (1958) : Sieve size mean from = 0. 903 (thin section mean) + 0. 381 phi combined quartile measures Ø 25, Ø 50,Ø 75 The regression coefficients differ from those of Friedman, probably because of the range of mean sizes investigated in the present work was twice as large (5. 7 phi units vs. 2. 6 phi units). The correlation coefficient relating sieve to thin section analysis decreases progressively, as Friedman found, from mean (0. 992) to standard deviation (0. 958), skewness (O. 536), and kurtosis (0. 249). The correlation for skewness and kurtosis is not significant. The size range was extended to - 3. 5 phi by the study of the mean size of selected gravel samples measured in sawn slabs. The resulting regression line has a slope of one and an intercept of 0. 4 phi and is close to that found for the sands. Grain size in grain mount is also closely related to sieve and thin section size, and a preliminary study of pebble size measured from photographs suggests that this may also be converted to an equivalent sieve size. On qualitative grounds the relationships between the various mean size statistics should involve the simple addition of a constant phi value. However the slopes of the regression equations found in the present work differ slightly from a slope of one. This difference is shown to represent a progressive shape change with size. For a constant b/a ratio of 0. 73 or 0. 70 conversion of thin section mean size (in phi units) to an equivalent sieve value should therefore be made by the simple addition of a 0. 33 or 0. 40 phi constant respectively...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Ethylene and {{propylene}} {{are important}} chemical feedstocks {{for the production of}} polyethylene and polypropylene. Ethylene and propylene can be produced by various methods including steam cracking of liquefied natural gas (LNG), naphta or light olefin fractions. The methanol to olefin (MTO) process provides an alternative means of producing ethylene and propylene, where ZSM- 5 is frequently used as catalyst due to its hydrophobicity, strong acidity, molecular sieve properties and low tendency towards coking, which makes ZSM- 5 one the most popular zeolite catalysts in the industry. The oil crisis 1973 and the second oil crisis in 1978 caused the development of a commercial MTO process. Mobil Research and Development Corporation built a fixed-bed pilot plant to demonstrate the feasibility of the MTO as well as methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) process. When the oil price dropped again during the 1980 ’s, further developments of commercial processes were stopped for the time being. However, investigations on a bench scale are still pursued, and applications for patents are still submitted. During this study ZSM- 5 was synthesized with a hydrothermal method, which produced agglomerated polycrystalline grains with characteristic ZSM- 5 morphology and a Si/Al ratio of approximately 40. The synthesis time, synthesis temperature and aging time were varied while keeping all the other synthesis parameters constant in order to determine their influence on crystallite size. The synthesis time was varied between 12 - 72 hours, synthesis temperature was varied between 130 - 170 °C and aging time between 30 - 90 minutes. Using SEM to determine crystal size, it was found that a variation in the aging time produced the largest crystallites (average of 21. 6 μm ± 10. 8 μm) while also having the largest influence on crystallite size followed by synthesis temperature (average of 13. 1 μm ± 4. 9 μm) and finally synthesis time (average of 5. 7 μm ± 0. 4 μm). In all cases XRD and SEM confirmed the formation of ZSM- 5. To evaluate the as-synthesized ZSM- 5 and compare it to a commercial ZSM- 5 catalyst, Catalyst A using the MTO process, ZSM- 5 was synthesized for 72 hours at 170 °C with an aging time of 60 minutes before synthesis. The as-synthesized as well as Catalyst A’s agglomerated polycrystalline <b>grains</b> were <b>sieved</b> into three size fractions: smaller than 75 μm, 75 - 150 μm and 150 - 300 μm. All six ZSM- 5 fractions of ZSM- 5 were used as catalysts for the MTO process in a fixed bed reactor at 400 °C, atmospheric pressure and a 20 wt% methanol to water feed. At 3. 5 hours time on stream (TOS), the intermediate 75 - 150 μm fraction had the highest light olefin selectivity for both the as-synthesized as well as Catalyst A, followed by the 150 - 300 μm fraction and finally the smaller than 75 μm fraction with the lowest light olefin selectivity. From this results {{it is clear that the}} as-synthesised ZSM- 5 did not perform as well as Catalyst A. While the intercrystalline voids of the agglomerated ZSM- 5 form second-order pores where self-diffusion is enhanced, the increased diffusional barriers created by the intercrystalline boundaries reduce the diffusion rate, promoting secondary reactions at the strong Brönsted acid sites thereby reducing ethylene and propylene selectivity. Coking reduces access to the Brönsted acid sites and plays a more influencial role for smaller crystallite sizes. Accordingly, the smaller than 75 μm fraction had the lowest light olefin selectivity, while the 150 - 300 μm fraction was probably least influenced by coking. The increased pathways for products and reagents in the 150 - 300 μm fraction resulted in more secondary reactions taking place within this catalyst than the 75 - 150 μm fraction explaining the superior performance of the 75 - 150 μm fraction. Since the grain size determines the ratio of the external to the internal surface areas as well as the amount of intercrystalline boundaries in the catalyst, it follows that the catalytic activity and polycrystalline grain size ratio should actually be tailored when optimising the product distribution of the ZSM- 5 catalysed MTO process. The as-synthesized ZSM- 5 didn’t perform very well when compared to Catalyst A and modification of the synthesis method is recommended. Master...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Starch in grains {{represents}} {{the main source}} of dietary energy for monogastric production animals. However, utilization of this energy is not complete due to factors related to grain source and in vivo gastrointestinal conditions. Incomplete starch digestion is a significant economic issue for the pork industry in Australia and prior evidence suggests that there is room for improvement. The general hypothesis of this thesis is that milled grain particle size fractions obtained by sieving posses a significantly different and wide range of functional and compositional properties in relation to digestion and hydrothermal processing. To identify these properties, sorghum and barley grains were milled separately using a 4 mm hammer-mill and then the ground cereals were segregated by size using a series of analytical sieves. Generated different particle sizes were investigated for their properties before and after cooking using extrusion processing. Sorghum was used {{as an example of a}} high starch content grain with low fibre content and barley was used as an example of a grain which contains high levels of fibre. Both grains are widely used as major feed ingredients in Australia, particularly in Queensland. Particle Size Effect on Digestibility The effect of milled uncooked grain particle size on the kinetics of enzymatic starch digestion and starch sources was examined. The in vitro starch digestion for different particle sizes were well fitted by simple first order kinetics for both barley (r 2 range 0. 90 - 0. 99) and sorghum (r 2 range 0. 87 - 0. 99). The digestion rate coefficients for different particle sizes decreased with increasing particle size, and were shown to be well fitted by an inverse square relationship for both barley (r 2 = 0. 99) and sorghum (r 2 = 0. 98). This supports the hypothesis that the rate-determining step in starch digestion is the diffusion of enzyme through the grain fragment. Quantitatively, the estimated (apparent) diffusion coefficient was estimated for both barley and sorghum (1. 7 and 0. 76 x 10 - 7 cm 2 s- 1, respectively). The apparent diffusion coefficient of á- amylase enzyme in grains was lower by an order of magnitude than that obtained in water, thus quantifying the barriers to amylase diffusion caused by grain structure. Particle Size Distribution in Milled Grain The contribution of individual size fractions to the overall hydration, rheological, and enzyme susceptibility properties of milled <b>grain</b> was evaluated. <b>Sieve</b> fractions were obtained from hammer-milled barley and sorghum <b>grains</b> (eight <b>sieves,</b> 0. 125 mm to 2. 8 mm opening size). Different particle size fractions showed a significant effect on digestion and hydrothermal properties. The extent of starch digestibility varied between different particle size up to 10 fold between the smallest and the largest particle size. When the results obtained for the unfractionated milled grain were compared to the weight average values (calculated from fraction yields and property values for each size fraction), water absorption index (WAI), water solubility index (WSI), and starch digestibility values were not significantly different from values obtained for non-fractionated ground grains of both barley and sorghum. Generally, hydration and digestibility results can be attributed to particle size and composition (starch or soluble fibre) of individual fractions. Response to hydrothermal treatment was different between sorghum and barley. In sorghum, viscosity profiles for the fractions were controlled by starch swelling which became increasingly limited as particle sizes increased. However in barley, viscosity profiles for segregated fractions did not show typical starch-based behaviour and were most likely controlled by the soluble fibre component. The results show the possibility of predicting and manipulating hydration and digestibility properties of ground grains simply by indentifying the particle size distribution of ground grains. Extrusion Processing of Milled Grain Extrusion processing was used in attempts to increase the rate and extent of starch digestibility as well as to characterize processing parameters and extrudate properties. Extrusion processing of three levels of particle size after sieve fractionation (fine, medium and coarse fractions) affected processing parameters (torque, specific mechanical energy [SME], die pressure), extrudate properties (WAI, WSI, expansion index, pasting profiles, and the kinetics and extent of starch digestion). The differences in response to processing parameters and extrudate properties was mainly due to the differences in viscosity during extrusion, while extrusion temperature (100 °C versus 140 °C maximum barrel temperature) had a smaller effect. The different particle size fractions of sorghum and barley both before and after extrusion showed a good fit to first-order kinetics of starch digestion, with all r 2 values above 0. 95. Results of the extrusion experiment suggested that the extent of swelling and gelatinisation during the extrusion may have been further improved by incorporating a pre-conditioning stage prior to extrusion. Particle size had a significant effect on the fractional digestion rate for both grains, but extrusion temperature had no effect. Based on fractional digestion rate values, extrusion processing at low temperature (100 °C) could be an alternative method to fine milling for achieving a high rate and extent of starch digestion. Feed Conversion in Pigs A novel processing procedure, based on separating the coarse fraction after hammer milling and then regrinding this fraction, was used in an attempt to improve growth performance in pigs offered barley and sorghum based diets. The pig feeding trial examined the effect of (a) grain type (barley; sorghum), (b) particle size (ground grain; ground grain where the coarse fraction was separated and re-ground then added back to the fine fraction), and (c) diet form (mash, pellet), on feed conversion ratio (FCR), rate of growth (ROG) and average daily intake (ADI). Particle size had the largest effect on FCR in pigs. Feeding pigs a barley or sorghum based diet in the mash form after regrinding the coarse fraction improved FCR in sorghum by 10 % and in barley by 7. 8 % compared to diets prepared without regrinding the coarse fraction. The form of the diet showed a smaller effect on FCR. In the pellet form, pigs fed sorghum or barley based diets after regrinding the coarse fraction improved FCR in sorghum by 5. 1 % and in barley by 4. 8 % compared to diets prepared without regrinding the coarse fraction. Within grain type, effects of particle size or diet form on ROG and ADI in barley were not statistically significant, although their ratio (FCR) did show significance. In sorghum, pigs offered diets in the ground-mash form had the highest ADI. Pigs offered ground-mash form (ground grain where the coarse fraction was separated and re-ground then added back to the fine fraction) had the highest ROG. The results from this investigation suggest that regrinding the coarse fraction after sieve separation can be used to maximise feed conversion ratio (FCR) for both barley and sorghum based diets. In contrast to single stage grinding through a smaller screen size, the regrinding method used in this work did not result in major increases in fractions with sizes below 0. 5 mm and particularly below 0. 25 mm. This is important as these very small particles cause dust problems in handling and on ingestion. Desired hydration properties, chemical composition, response to hydrothermal treatment, and extent of starch digestion could be manipulated by modifying the distribution of particular size fractions of ground grains. Extrusion of medium and coarse size fractions can enhance digestibility with efficient utilization of thermal energy compared to extrusion of ground but unfractionated grains. This could be a good processing strategy as this work has found that the rate and extent of starch digestion is relatively high for uncooked small particle size fractions. Alternatively, regrinding the coarse fraction after separation could be an alternative method to conventional steam pelletizing for increasing starch digestibility and energy delivery to growing pigs...|$|R
