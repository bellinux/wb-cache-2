The complexity of antibiotic therapy of diseases caused by methicillin resistant staphylococci having high poly resistance almost to every classes of antibacterial agents is of prime importance. One of the ways to improve antibacterial preparations still remains the development of their liposomal forms. This work studies antistaphylococcal activity (according to MIC) of the liposomal form of lincomycin developed in the Institute of Dermatology and Venereology of Ukraine by Ivanova N.

The purpose of this research work was to study liposomal <b>inhibiting</b> <b>concentration</b> of the liposomalny form of lincomycin and a commercial preparation lincomycin (produced by CJSC “Pharmaceutical firm "Darnitsa").

Antibacterial activity of the liposomal form of lincomycin is studied concerning the patients selected from the different biotopes with pyo inflammatory diseases of staphylococcus strains (15 strains – methicillin sensitive, 12 strains - methicillin resistant).

The {{present study was}} undertaken to evaluate the antibiotic and metal resistance profile of Indian clinical isolate of A. haemolyticus MMC 8 isolated from human pus sample in planktonic and biofilm form. Methods: Antibiotic susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentration were determined employing broth and agar dilution techniques.

Carboxyatractylate inhibition decreases when the palmitate concentration increases.

These data together with observations that palmitate does not increase H+ conductance in bilayer phospholipid membranes and in cytochrome oxidase-asolectin proteoliposomes indicate that the ATP/ADP-antiporter is somehow involved in the uncoupling by low concentrations of fatty acids (or DNP), whereas that by FCCP and gramicidin D is due to their effect on the phospholipid bilayer.
