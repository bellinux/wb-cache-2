40|$|Gravid Atlantic menhaden, Brevoortia tyrannus, are {{available}} along the central coast of North Carolina {{during the fall}} and are harvested by the purse-seine fleet from the port of Beaufort. Virtually all of the catch, sexually immature fish included, is reduces to fish meal, fish oil, and fish solubles; however, minor quantities of roe from ripening female menhaden are extracted for local consupmtion. Routine and selective port sampling information was used to characterize the seasonal and biostatistical nautre of the roe menhaden catches at Beaufort. Fishermen recognize two size classes of roe Atlantic menhaden: "forerunners," which are usually the smallest and earliest adult menhaden encountered in the Fall Fishery, and "mammy shad," which are the largest menhaden harvested and produce the greatest roe yields. Roe is extracted from femal fish at various points along the reduction process stream and by several techniques. Vessel cremen and factory personnel extract menhaden roe for personal and local consumption. Undetermined quantities of menhaden roe are channeled into local retail seafood markets.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Atlantic menhaden, {{compared}} to <b>gulf</b> <b>menhaden,</b> exhibit a life history pattern {{that appears to}} be adapted to a more unpredictable reproductive environment. From experiments on laboratory-reared eggs and larvae, Atlantic menhaden have larger eggs with larger yolk volume. They are larger at hatching, utilize their yolk faster, begin feeding at an earlier age, and are larger at onset of feeding. Egg size and the rate of morphogenesis from hatching to first feeding appeared to influence future larval size. When given ample food and reared at moderate (20 °C) to high (24 °C) temperatures, Atlantic menhaden were larger than <b>gulf</b> <b>menhaden</b> at 10 -days past first feeding even though growth of both larvae was similar. As Atlantic menhaden undergo their first apparent transformation at a relatively smaller size, they will spend relatively less time in the earliest life history stage. A synthesis of published adult life histories also indicated that Atlantic menhaden life histories are adapted to a more unpredictable reproductive environment. They have a larger maximum body size and are larger than <b>gulf</b> <b>menhaden</b> at any specific age. They are older than <b>gulf</b> <b>menhaden</b> at the onset of sexual maturity, but have a longer reproductive span. Stock-recruitment models indicated that variations in environmental factors {{play a major role in}} determining the number of Atlantic menhaden recruits, whereas environmental factors play a lesser role in <b>gulf</b> <b>menhaden</b> recruitment. Atlantic menhaden populations, unlike <b>gulf</b> <b>menhaden,</b> exhibit density-dependent growth suggesting that food resources for pre-recruit Atlantic menhaden may be limiting when numbers are high. Exploitation of Atlantic menhaden populations has resulted in a truncation of the population's age structure. This has resulted in: a contraction of spawning in time and space; a truncation of their reproductive span, thus altering the net reproductive rate; a loss in fecundity, as fecundity is age-specific; and if egg size is related to age of fish, a modification of the egg size distribution within the population. Overexploitation of <b>gulf</b> <b>menhaden</b> resulting in alteration of life history traits could have serious consequences because the reproductive span of this menhaden is so brief...|$|E

40|$|With its genesis in New England {{during the}} 1800 's, the purse seine fishery for Atlantic menhaden, Brevoortia tyrannus, {{expanded}} south {{and by the}} early 1900 's ranged {{the length of the}} eastern seaboard. The purse seine fishery for <b>Gulf</b> <b>menhaden.</b> B. patronus, is of relatively recent development, exploitation of the stock beginning in the late 1940 's. Landings from both fisheries annually comprise 35 - 40 % of the total U. S. fisheries landings, ranking menhaden first in terms of volume landed. Technological advances in harvesting methods, fish-spotting capabilities, and vessel designs accelerated after World War II, resulting in larger, faster, and wider-ranging carrier vessels, improved speed and efficiency of the harvest, and reduction in labor requirements. Chief products of the menhaden industry are fish meal, fish oil, and solubles, but research into new product lines is underway.

40|$|Abstract: Terracing is a {{relatively}} new wetland-restoration technique used to convert shallow subtidal bot-tom to marsh. This method uses existing bottom sediments to form terraces or ridges at marsh elevation. A terrace field is constructed by arranging these ridges in some pattern that maximizes intertidal edge and minimizes fetch between ridges; the intertidal area is planted with marsh vegetation. We examined the habitat value of terracing for fishery species at Sabine National Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana (USA) in spring and fall 1999 by quantifying and comparing nekton densities in a 9 -yr-old terrace field and nearby reference area using a 1 -m 2 drop sampler. Decapod crustaceans were more abundant than fishes, composing 62 % and 95 % of all organisms we collected in spring and fall, respectively.

40|$|Atlantic {{menhaden}} (Brevoortia tyrannus), through landings, {{support one}} of the largest commercial fisheries in the United States. Recent consolidation of the once coast-wide reduction fishery to waters within and around Chesapeake Bay has raised concerns over the possibility of the loss of unique genetic variation resulting from concentrated fishing pressure. To address this question, we surveyed variation at the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene region and seven nuclear microsatellite loci to evaluate stock structure of Atlantic menhaden. Samples were collected from up to three cohorts of Atlantic menhaden at four geographic locations along the U. S.

Genetic divergence between Atlantic menhaden and <b>Gulf</b> <b>menhaden,</b> based on the COI gene region sequences and microsatellite loci, was more characteristic of conspecific populations than separate species. Hierarchical analyses of molecular variance indicated a homogeneous distribution of genetic variation within Atlantic menhaden. No significant variation was found between young-of-the-year menhaden (YOY) collected early and late in the season within Chesapeake Bay, between young-of-the-year and yearling menhaden collected in the Chesapeake Bay during the same year, between YOY and yearling menhaden taken in Chesapeake Bay in successive years, or among combined YOY and yearling Atlantic menhaden collected in both years from the four geographic locations. The genetic connectivity between the regional collections indicates that the concentration of fishing pressure in and around Chesapeake Bay will not result in a significant loss of unique genetic variation...|$|E

Bag seine, otter trawl, experimental gill net and hydrographic sampling was conducted at nine stations located between the mouth of the Rio Grande (river mile 0) and near Brownsville, Texas (river mile 51). Ninety-eight taxa (77 fishes and 21 macroinvertebrates) represented by 38, 958 nekton constituents were grouped according to estuarine utilization into estuarinedependent (45 taxa), resident (23), marine (17), and freshwater components (15). Five estuarine-dependent taxa-brown shrimp, white shrimp, <b>gulf</b> <b>menhaden,</b> bay anchovy, and striped mullet-comprised 78 % of the study-wide harvest and dominated quarterly catches. Nekton community structure indices (species diversity, evenness, and richness) were calculated for quarterly seine and trawl collections at each station and pooled to provide seasonal values. Greater species utilization of the estuary during warm months (May, August, and November) and recruitment of seasonally dominant species significantly affected species diversity and richness. Significant reductions in species diversity and richness during February coincided with water temperature minima and a notable increase in <b>gulf</b> <b>menhaden</b> and striped mullet abundance. Species diversity and richness near the river mouth were significantly greater than those at upstream stations (river miles 40 and 5 1).
