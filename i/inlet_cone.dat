25|$|It had a circular-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage with a nose air intake. A range-only radar {{was fitted}} in the conical <b>inlet</b> <b>cone</b> {{of the air}} intake. The wings had a sweep angle of 55° at quarterchord. Two wing fences were fitted on the upper surface of each wing. The horizontal stabilizer was midway down the rear fuselage and two air brakes were fitted on its underside. The cockpit canopy was faired into the spine that {{ran the length of}} the top of the fuselage. The tandem undercarriage had a single wheel on the forward unit and twin wheels on the main unit with outrigger struts that retracted aft into wingtip fairings.|$|E
25|$|Early {{versions}} of the Lightning were equipped with the Ferranti-developed AI.23 monopulse radar, which was contained right {{at the front of}} the fuselage within an <b>inlet</b> <b>cone</b> at the centre of the engine intake. Radar information was displayed on an early head-up display and managed by onboard computers. The AI.23, an immediate predecessor of the AI.24 Foxhunter, supported several operational modes, which included autonomous search, automatic target tracking, and ranging for all weapons; the pilot attack sight provided gyroscopically-derived lead angle and backup stadiametric ranging for gun firing. The radar and gunsight were collectively designated the AIRPASS: Airborne Interception Radar and Pilot Attack Sight System. The radar would be successively upgraded with the introduction of more capable Lightning variants, such as to provide guidance for the Red Top missile.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the M.52 was cylindrical and, {{like the}} rest of the aircraft, was constructed of high tensile steel with light-alloy covering. The fuselage had the minimum cross-section allowable around the centrifugal engine with fuel tanks in a saddle-like arrangement placed over the upper area around it. The engine was positioned with its center of gravity coincident with that of the aircraft and the wings were attached to the main structure just aft of the engine. The use of a shock cone in the nose was another key design choice; the <b>inlet</b> <b>cone</b> slowed incoming air to the subsonic speeds determined by the engine, but with lower losses than a subsonic aircraft pitot intake. A retractable tricycle undercarriage was used. The nose wheel was positioned close to the pilot's feet and the main wheels were fitted onto the main fuselage, folding out under the wings when deployed.|$|E
50|$|The F-104 was {{designed}} to use the General Electric J79 turbojet engine, fed by side-mounted intakes with fixed <b>inlet</b> <b>cones</b> optimized for supersonic speeds. Unlike some supersonic aircraft, the F-104 did not have variable-geometry inlets. Its thrust-to-drag ratio was excellent, allowing a maximum speed well in excess of Mach 2.|$|R
50|$|During Project OXCART, the {{operation}} of the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft, the CIA funded an attempt to reduce the RCS of the A-12's <b>inlet</b> <b>cones.</b> Known as Project KEMPSTER, this used an electron beam generator to create a cloud of ionization in front of each inlet. The system was flight tested but was never deployed on operational A-12s or SR-71s.|$|R
500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the XF-104 {{had a high}} fineness ratio, i.e., tapering sharply {{towards the}} nose, and a small frontal area of [...] The fuselage was tightly packed, containing the cockpit, avionics, cannon, all internal fuel, landing gear, and engine. The air intakes, designed by Ben Rich, were of fixed geometry without <b>inlet</b> <b>cones,</b> since the J65-powered aircraft was incapable of Mach2 performance. They {{were similar to those}} of the F-94 Starfire, being mounted slightly away from the fuselage, with an inner splitter plate for the boundary layer bleed air. The combination of these features provided extremely low drag except at high angle of attack, at which point induced drag became very high.|$|R
500|$|A {{symposium}} titled [...] "Supersonic-Transport Implications" [...] was {{hosted by}} the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1960. Various views were put forward on the likely type of powerplant for a supersonic transport, such as podded or buried installation and turbojet or ducted-fan engines. Boundary layer management in the podded installation was put forward as simpler with only an <b>inlet</b> <b>cone</b> but Dr. Seddon of the RAE saw [...] "a future in a more sophisticated integration of shapes" [...] in a buried installation. Another concern highlighted the case with two or more engines [...] situated behind a single intake. An intake failure {{could lead to a}} double or triple engine failure. The advantage of the ducted fan over the turbojet was reduced airport noise but with considerable economic penalties with its larger cross-section producing excessive drag. At that time it was considered that the noise from a turbojet optimised for supersonic cruise could be reduced to an acceptable level using noise suppressors as used on subsonic jets.|$|E
2500|$|P.1B was a {{significant}} improvement on P.1A. While it was similar in aerodynamics, structure and control systems, it incorporated extensive alterations to the forward fuselage, reheated Rolls Royce Avon R24R engines, a conical centre body <b>inlet</b> <b>cone,</b> variable nozzle reheat and provision for [...] weapons systems integrated with the ADC and AI.23 radar.

2500|$|The {{next two}} Lightning variants, the Lightning F.1A and F.2, were steady but {{relatively}} minor refinements of the design; the next variant, the Lightning F.3, {{was a major}} departure. The F.3 had higher thrust Rolls-Royce Avon 301R engines, a larger squared-off fin and strengthened <b>inlet</b> <b>cone</b> allowing a service clearance to [...] (the F.1, F.1A and F.2 were limited to [...] ). The A.I.23B radar and Red Top missile offered a forward hemisphere attack capability and deletion of the nose cannon. The new engines and fin made the F.3 the highest performance Lightning yet, but with an even higher fuel consumption and resulting shorter range. The next variant, the Lightning F.6, was already in development, {{but there was a}} need for an interim solution to partially address the F.3’s shortcomings, the F.3A.|$|E

50|$|The air intakes {{originally}} designed by Ben Rich {{were of the}} same fixed geometry as the F-104A, but included extensions to the <b>inlet</b> shock <b>cones</b> for optimum jet engine operation at higher Mach numbers.Internal fuselage differences included provision for rocket fuel oxidizer tanks, deletion of the M61 Vulcan cannon, radar equipment and unnecessary avionics. A nitrogen tank was installed for cabin pressurization purposes. This was required as {{there would be no}} bleed air available from the engine after its normal and expected cutoff in the climb phase.|$|R
5|$|The AFVG {{was to be}} {{powered by}} a pair of SNECMA/Bristol Siddeley M45G turbofans, which were to be fed by Mirage-style half-shock <b>cone</b> <b>inlets.</b> The engine {{development}} programme contract was to be issued by the French government to a SNECMA/Bristol Siddeley joint venture company registered in France.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} is semi-monocoque with an elliptical {{profile and}} a maximum width of [...] The air flow to the engine is regulated by an <b>inlet</b> <b>cone</b> in the air intake. On early model MiG-21s, the cone has three positions. For speeds up to Mach 1.5 the cone is fully retracted to the maximum aft position. For speeds between Mach 1.5 and Mach 1.9 the cone moves to the middle position. For speeds higher than Mach 1.9 the cone moves to the maximum forward position. On the later model MiG-21PF, the intake cone moves to a position based on the actual speed. The cone position for a given speed is calculated by the UVD-2M system using air pressures from in front and behind the compressor of the engine. On {{both sides of the}} nose there are gills to supply the engine with more air while on the ground and during takeoff. In the first variant of the MiG-21, the pitot tube is attached {{to the bottom of the}} nose. After the MiG-21P variant, this tube is attached to the top of the air intake.|$|E
2500|$|The Lightning {{had several}} {{distinctive}} design features, {{the principal of}} these being the twin engine arrangement, notched delta wing, and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimizing frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the drag equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin engine installations. The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with <b>inlet</b> <b>cone),</b> with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. However, because the engines were close together, an uncontained failure of one engine was likely to damage the other engine. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance; although this was rarely done operationally because {{there would be no}} hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed [...]|$|E
50|$|Many second {{generation}} supersonic fighter aircraft featured an <b>inlet</b> <b>cone,</b> {{which was used}} to form the conical shock wave. This type of <b>inlet</b> <b>cone</b> is clearly seen at the very front of the English Electric Lightning and MiG-21 aircraft, for example.|$|E

25|$|Adding to the plane's {{troubles}} was the pilots' {{decision to}} maneuver closely behind a DC-9 that was taxiing {{just ahead of}} them prior to takeoff, due to their mistaken belief that the warmth from the DC-9's engines would melt the snow and ice that had accumulated on Flight 90's wings. This action—which went specifically against flight manual recommendations for an icing situation—actually contributed to additional icing on the 737.

50|$|The <b>inlet</b> <b>cone</b> {{is shaped}} {{so that the}} shock wave that forms on its apex is {{directed}} to {{the lip of the}} intake; this allows the intake to operate properly in supersonic flight. As speed increases, the shock wave becomes increasingly more oblique (the cone gets narrower). For higher flight speeds inlet cones are designed to move axially to control how the capture area varies with the duct internal throat area. For best intake operation this required area ratio gets bigger with increasing flight Mach number, hence the large <b>inlet</b> <b>cone</b> movement on the SR-71 which had to perform well from zero to Mach 3.2.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA miniature ramjet engine designed {{to perform at}} Mach 4. 0 was tested in a supersonic wind tunnel.

50|$|At {{the front}} of the engine, a simple {{translating}} axisymmetric shock <b>cone</b> <b>inlet</b> slows the air to subsonic speeds using two shock reflections. Part of the air then passes through a precooler into the central core, with the remainder passing directly through a ring of bypass ramjets. The central core of SABRE behind the precooler uses a turbo-compressor run off the same gaseous helium loop Brayton cycle which compresses the air and feeds it into four high pressure combined cycle rocket engine combustion chambers. The oxygen is also fed to the combustion unit, using a turbopump.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A closed type {{crankcase}} ventilation system has been adopted to engines to prevent emission of blow-by gas to atmosphere. In the early closed type {{crankcase ventilation}} system, blow-by gas which contains engine lubricating oil is re-circulated into the intake system. The blow-by gas containing oil mist leads to increased harmful emissions and engine problems. To reduce loss of the engine oil, a highly-efficient oil separation device is required. Principle of a cyclone oil separator is to utilize centrifugal force in the separator and, therefore, oil separator designs depend on rotational flow which causes the centrifugal force. In this paper, flow characteristics and oil separation performances for cyclone type designs are calculated with CFD methodology. In the CFD model, oil particle was injected on a inlet surface with Rosin-Rammler distribution and uniform distribution. The major design parameters considered in the analysis model are <b>inlet</b> area, <b>cone</b> length and outlet depth of the oil separator. As results, reducing inlet area and increasing cone length increase oil separation performance. Changes in outlet depth could avoid interference betwee...|$|R
50|$|Thermal and {{structural}} limits were also present. Air is heated considerably when compressed by {{the passage of}} an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the <b>inlet</b> shock <b>cone</b> {{at the front of}} the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The shock cone was composed of fibreglass, necessary because the shock cone also served as a radar radome; a metal shock cone would interfere with the AI 23’s radar emissions. The shock cone would be eventually weakened due to the fatigue caused by the thermal cycles involved in regularly performing high-speed flights. At 36000 ft and 1.7 Mach 36000 km/h, the heating conditions on the shock cone would be similar to those at Sea Level and 650 kn indicated airspeed, but if the speed was increased to 2.0 Mach 36000 km/h at 36000 ft, the shock cone would be exposed to higher temperatures than those at Mach 1.7. The shock cone was strengthened on the later Lightning F.2A, F.3, F.6, and F.53 models, thus allowing routine operations at up to Mach 2.0.|$|R
25|$|Supersonic speeds also {{threatened}} inlet stability; the <b>inlet's</b> central shock <b>cone</b> {{served as}} a compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip; known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned {{just in front of}} the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock would become supercritical, and supersonic airflow would enter the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in surges or compressor stalls, these could cause flameouts or damage.|$|R

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of an <b>inlet</b> <b>cone</b> is to slow the flow of air from {{supersonic}} flight speed to a subsonic speed before it enters the engine. Except for scramjet engines, all airbreathing jet engines need subsonic airflow to operate properly, and require a diffuser to prevent supersonic airflow inside the engine. At supersonic flight speeds a conical shock wave, sloping rearwards, forms {{at the apex of}} the cone. Air passing through the conical shock wave (and subsequent reflections) slows to a low supersonic speed. The air then passes through a strong normal shock wave, within the diffuser passage, and exits at a subsonic velocity. The resulting intake system is more efficient (in terms of pressure recovery) than the much simpler pitot intake.|$|E

After Suntan was canceled, hydrogen proving to be impractical for a number of reasons, Rich became propulsion systems program manager for the U-2's successors, the A-12 and the SR-71 Blackbird.

40|$|Three {{effective}} inlet cleanup {{methods are}} described. A flared reverse <b>cone</b> <b>inlet</b> {{is used to}} eliminate wakes from the fan casings and/or probe supports. Boundary layer suction is employed ahead of the fan rotor and on the outer flare of the cone to reduce the boundary layer turbulence and remove any residual wakes. To reduce the midstream turbulent intensity and length scales, a turbulence control structure is used which is constructed with both a layer of honeycomb and a fine mesh screen. The effects of these cleanup methods are quantified by measuring the far-field noise in an anechoic chamber, using a high-speed 20 -in. -diam fan of the current high passband type. The changes in the turbulent field impinging on this rotor are quantified by mapping the streamwise and transverse turbulent properties (spectra, intensity and length scale) with crossed hot film probes.

40|$|A widely {{recognized}} problem in jet engine fan noise is {{the discrepancy between}} inflight and static tests. This discrepancy consists of blade passing frequency tones, caused by ingested turbulence that appear in the static tests but not in flight. To reduce the ingested distortions and turbulence in an anechoic chamber, a reverse <b>cone</b> <b>inlet</b> is used to guide the air into the fan. This inlet also has provisions for boundary layer suction and is {{used in conjunction with}} a turbulence control structure (TCS) to condition the air impinging on the fan. The program was very successful in reducing the ingested turbulence, to the point where reductions in the acoustic power at blade passing frequency are as high as 18 db for subsonic tip speeds. Even with this large subsonic tone suppression, the supersonic tip speed tonal content remains largely unchanged, indicating that the TCS did not appreciably attenuate the noise but effects the generation via turbulence reduction. Turbulence mapping of the inlet confirmed that the tone reductions are due to a reduction in turbulence, as the low frequency power spectra of the streamwise and transverse turbulence were reduced by up to ten times and 100 times, respectively...|$|R
