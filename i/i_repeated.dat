25|$|If {{the protein}} of {{interest}} is not secreted by the organism into the surrounding solution, {{the first step of}} each purification process is the disruption of the cells containing the protein. Depending on how fragile the protein is and how stable the cells are, one could, for instance, use one of the following methods: <b>i)</b> <b>repeated</b> freezing and thawing, ii) sonication, iii) homogenization by high pressure (French press), iv) homogenization by grinding (bead mill), and v) permeabilization by detergents (e.g. Triton X-100) and/or enzymes (e.g. lysozyme). Finally, the cell debris can be removed by centrifugation so that the proteins and other soluble compounds remain in the supernatant.|$|E

40|$|Thrombospondin (TSP) 1 is a trimeric {{extracellular}} matrix protein that is {{held together by}} two cysteine residues. It {{is one of five}} TSP proteins that have been described to date with almost a universal heparin binding capability (TSP 5 being the exception). The existence of two conformationally distinct structures in the TSP family (trimers and pentamers) prompted us to investigate the contribution of TSP 1 trimeric structure to its inhibitory role in angiogenesis. We expressed full-length recombinant human TSP 1, its type <b>I</b> <b>repeats,</b> and murine TSP 3 in a human embryonic kidney cell line and evaluated their effect on human dermal microvascular endothelial cell (HMVEC) proliferation and sprouting into tube-like structures in vitro. Additionally, two chimaeric molecules were constructed so that the type <b>I</b> <b>repeats</b> of TSP 1 were expressed as either dimers (TSP 1 -Ig chimaera) or pentamers (TSP 1 -TSP 3 chimaera). Dimeric and pentameric type I constructs are novel structures. We found that, similarly to full-length TSP 1, intact trimeric type <b>I</b> <b>repeats</b> were inhibitory to HMVEC angiogenesis in vitro. However, dimeric and pentameric type <b>I</b> <b>repeats</b> of TSP 1 only partially inhibited HMVEC proliferation and sprouting in vitro. TSP 3, which is lacking type <b>I</b> <b>repeats,</b> had no inhibitory activity, confirming that type <b>I</b> <b>repeats</b> elicit the anti-angiogenic activity of TSP 1...|$|R

500|$|... (Medieval Latin for [...] "the Great Charter of the Liberties"), {{commonly}} called [...] (also Magna Charta; [...] "(the) Great Charter"), is a charter {{agreed to by}} King John of England at Runnymede, near Windsor, on 15 June 1215. First drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury to make peace between the unpopular King {{and a group of}} rebel barons, it promised the protection of church rights, protection for the barons from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and limitations on feudal payments to the Crown, to be implemented through a council of 25 barons. Neither side stood behind their commitments, and the charter was annulled by Pope Innocent III, leading to the First Barons' War. After John's death, the regency government of his young son, Henry III, reissued the document in 1216, stripped of some of its more radical content, in an unsuccessful bid to build political support for their cause. [...] At {{the end of the war}} in 1217, it formed part of the peace treaty agreed at Lambeth, where the document acquired the name Magna Carta, to distinguish it from the smaller Charter of the Forest which was issued at the same time. Short of funds, Henry reissued the charter again in 1225 in exchange for a grant of new taxes; his son, Edward <b>I,</b> <b>repeated</b> the exercise in 1297, this time confirming it as part of England's statute law.|$|E

50|$|TSP1 {{contains}} three type <b>I</b> <b>repeats,</b> {{only the}} second two {{of which have been}} found to inhibit angiogenesis. The type <b>I</b> <b>repeat</b> motif is more effective than the entire protein at inhibiting angiogenesis and contains not one but two regions of activity. The amino-terminal end contains a tryptophan-rich motif that blocks fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2 or bFGF) driven angiogenesis. This region has also been found to prevent FGF-2 binding ECs, suggesting that its mechanism of action may be to sequester FGF-2. The second region of activity, the CD36 binding region of TSP1, {{can be found on the}} carboxy-terminal half of the type <b>I</b> <b>repeats.</b> It has been suggested that activating the CD36 receptor causes an increase in ECs sensitivity to apoptotic signals. Type <b>I</b> <b>repeats</b> have also been shown to bind to heparin, fibronectin, TGF-β, and others, potentially antagonizing the effects of these molecules on ECs. However, CD36 is generally considered to be the dominant inhibitory signaling receptor for TSP1, and EC expression of CD36 is restricted to microvascular ECs.|$|R

40|$|Type <b>I</b> <b>repeat</b> {{sequences}} are evolutionarily {{conserved sequence}} elements {{found in the}} replication origin and transcriptional promoter region of the rRNA genes (rDNA) in Tetrahymena thermophila. An abundant single-stranded DNA binding protein, ssA-TIBF, specifically interacts with the A-rich strand of the Type <b>I</b> <b>repeat</b> sequence. Quantitative binding competition experiments performed with purified ssATIBF demonstrate that the binding site for ssA-TIBF includes sequences both within the conserved 33 nt element and in a 32 ̆ 7 flanking region: addition of the 32 ̆ 7 flanking sequence to the Type <b>I</b> <b>repeat</b> oligonucleotide increases the binding affinity of ssA-TIBF by nearly 100 -fold (apparent K 2 ̆ 6 = 3. 0 x 10 10 M). A mutation in the ssA-TIBF binding site previously shown to be the determinant of an rDNA replication defect in vivo results in a 25 -fold decrease in ssA-TIBF binding affinity in vitro. ssA-TIBF also binds with high affinity to {{a copy of the}} Type <b>I</b> <b>repeat</b> sequence within the essential promoter region defined by in vitro transcription assays. The affinity of ssA-TIBF for the promoter repeat, which differs from other copies of the repeat at 8 out of 33 positions, is at least equal to its affinity for the Type <b>I</b> <b>repeat</b> sequences in the origin region. The biochemical properties of ssA-TIBF in vitro suggest that it could play a role in both replication and transcription of Tetrahymena rDNA in vivo...|$|R
50|$|Both the procollagen {{domain and}} the type <b>I</b> <b>repeats</b> of TSP1 {{have been shown to}} inhibit neovascularization and EC migration. However, it is {{unlikely}} that the mechanisms of action of these fragments are the same. The type <b>I</b> <b>repeats</b> of TSP1 are capable of inhibiting EC migration in a Boyden chamber assay after a 3-4 hour exposure, whereas a 36- to 48-hour exposure period is necessary for inhibition of EC migration with the procollagen domain. Whereas the chorioallantroic membrane (CAM) assay shows the type <b>I</b> <b>repeats</b> of TSP1 to be antiangiogenic, it also shows that the procollagen sequence lacks anti-angiogenic activity. This may be in part because the animo-terminal end of TSP1 differs more than the carboxy-terminal end across species, but may also suggest different mechanisms of action.|$|R
