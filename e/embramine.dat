40|$|Three simple, {{accurate}} and rapid methods were {{developed for the}} assay of 2 antihistamines, <b>embramine</b> and hydroxyzine hydrochlorides in bulk and in pharmaceutical prepns. The methods depend on the titrn. of the chloride content of the drugs with silver nitrate, with visual, potentiometric and conductometric end-point detection. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{order of}} {{clinical}} potency of seven Hi receptor antagonist antihistamines in usual therapeutic doses was evaluated in 30 patients of chronic idiopathic urticaria by a double blind, placebo controlled trial utilizing a self-assessment method. The analysis of mean whealing and, itching scores established a potency sequence in the -decreasing order of cyproheptidine, hydroxyzine, chlorpheniramine, <b>embramine,</b> promethazine, dimethâ€²mdene and dexchlorpheniramme. The {{differences between the}} first five antihistamines were not statistically significant, though these were superior to ddxchlorpheniralmine and placebo. Dexchlorpheniramine was statistically better than placebo...|$|E
40|$|The {{mononuclear}} Mn(II) complexes of {{the type}} [Mn(L) n(H 2 O) 2 Cl 2] (where n = 1 or 2) were prepd. with biol. important drugs viz. Clomiphene citrate (CPC), Imipramine hydrochloride (IMH), Diphenylpyraline hydrochloride (DPH), <b>Embramine</b> hydrochloride (EBH), and Dothiepin hydrochloride (DOT), and characterized by using elemental anal., infra-red (IR), UV-visible spectra, X-ray powder diffraction studies and thermogravimetric anal. The molar conductance measurement of all the complexes in DMF soln. corresponds to non-electrolytic nature. All complexes were of the high-spin type and found to have six-coordinate octahedral geometry. The antimicrobial activity of these complexes has been screened against two gram-pos. and two gram-neg. bacteria. Antifungal activity against two different fungi has been evaluated and compared with std. drug. All the complexes inhibit the growth of both gram-pos. and gram-neg. bacteria to competent level.
