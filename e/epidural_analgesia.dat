2500|$|Pain {{management}} is classified into either pre-emptive or on-demand. [...] On-demand pain medications typically include either opioid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs {{but can also}} make use of novel approaches such as inhaled nitrous oxide or ketamine. [...] On demand drugs can be administered by a clinician ("as needed drug orders") or by the patient using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). [...] PCA {{has been shown to}} provide slightly better pain control and increased patient satisfaction when compared with conventional methods. [...] Common preemptive approaches include epidural neuraxial blockade or nerve blocks. [...] One review which looked at pain control after abdominal aortic surgery found that epidural blockade provides better pain relief (especially during movement) in the period up to three postoperative days. It reduces the duration of postoperative tracheal intubation by roughly half.

Patients & Methods: On demand, <b>epidural</b> labour <b>analgesia</b> was given to 50 nulliparous healthy term parturients (cephalic presentation), divided in two groups randomly. Group I received bupivacaine (0. 125 %) alone, whereas Group II received bupivacaine (0. 125 %) along with Clonidine (60 μg). 10 ml of 0. 125 % bupivacaine was injected as first dose and further doses titrated with patient relief (Numerical Rating Scale < 3). Top ups were given whenever Numerical Rating Scale went above 5. Results: There was statistically significant prolongation of duration of analgesia in Group II, with no difference in duration of labour, ambulation, incidence of instrumentation and caesarean section or foetal outcome.

Materials and Methods: Fifty full term parturients received an initial bolus dose of a 10 ml solution containing 0. 125 &#x 0025; bupivacaine. The patients were randomly divided into two: group F received 0. 0625 &#x 0025; bupivacaine with 2. 5 mcg/ml fentanyl and group S received 0. 0625 &#x 0025; bupivacaine with 0. 25 mcg/ml sufentanil. Verbal analogue pain scores, need of supplementary/rescue boluses dose of bupivacaine consumed, mode of delivery, maternal satisfaction, and neonatal Apgar scores were recorded. No significant difference was observed between both groups. Results: Both the groups provided equivalent labor analgesia and maternal satisfaction. The chances of cesarean delivery were also not increased in any group. No difference in the cephalad extent of sensory analgesia, motor block or neonatal Apgar score were observed. Although mean pain scores throughout the labor and delivery were similar in both groups, more patients in fentanyl group required supplementary boluses though not statistically significant.
