5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted him, {{even to the}} point of being partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as Mayor was probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding parties. On the other hand, he appears to have personally profited from the Appellants' period of rule, and it seems that there was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to have married at least twice, he seems to have had no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>he</b> was {{uncertain}} {{whether he would}} attend college, but ultimately he applied and was accepted to Hampden–Sydney College in Virginia, where a friend had also enrolled. Arriving in 1982, he continued to participate in plays while studying mainly philosophy. He found the curriculum rigorous, but was more focused {{than he had been}} in high school and was able to apply himself to his studies. Despite the lack of a significant theater community at Hampden–Sydney, Colbert's interest in acting escalated during this time. After two years, he transferred in 1984 to Northwestern University as a theater major to study performance, emboldened by the realization that he loved performing, even when no one was coming to shows. He graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 1986.|$|E

She later leaves Madurai and arrives at Tiruchi, where she obtains {{work as a}} maid of blackmarketeer Narayana Pillai, who also tries to molest her. She is, however, saved by his wife, and leaves the job. While searching for his sister, Gunasekaran reaches Tiruchi and comes across Vimala, a wealthy woman, to whom he explains the miserable status {{of him and his}} sister in the society.

5|$|Mitsuda {{was born}} in Tokuyama, Japan, on January 21, 1972, and {{was raised in the}} Kumage District of Yamaguchi Prefecture. He took piano lessons {{beginning}} at the age of five, but was more interested in sports at the time and did not take music seriously, quitting by the age of six. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>he</b> wanted to become a professional golfer. While in high school, Mitsuda rediscovered music, inspired by Vangelis' Blade Runner and Henry Mancini's The Pink Panther film scores. After watching Railman, he decided to become a music composer. He became interested in PCs after his father bought him one, which was a rare item at the time. He started to program computer games and compose music for them, as well as take more technically oriented classes.|$|E
5|$|Howard Browne {{took over}} as editor of both Amazing Stories and Fantastic Adventures in 1950. Browne {{preferred}} fantasy to science fiction, and enjoyed editing Fantastic Adventures, but when his plans for taking Amazing upmarket were derailed by the Korean War, he lost interest in both magazines <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>He</b> let William Hamling take responsibility for both titles, and the quality declined. At the end of 1950, Ziff-Davis moved its offices from Chicago to New York; Browne relocated to New York, but Hamling decided to stay in Chicago, so Browne became more involved once again, and sf historians such as Brian Stableford and Mike Ashley consider the result {{to have been a}} definite improvement in quality. Browne's interest in fantasy led him to start a new digest-sized magazine, Fantastic, in the summer of 1952; it was an immediate success, and led Ziff-Davis to convert Amazing Stories to digest format as well. The move from the pulp format to digests was well under way in the early 1950s, and with Fantastics success there was little reason to keep Fantastic Adventures going. It was merged with Fantastic; the last issue was dated March 1953, and the MayJune issue of Fantastic added a mention of Fantastic Adventures to the masthead, though this disappeared with the following issue.|$|E
5|$|In {{the cross}} country events, {{the heat of}} 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 {{competitors}} to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide {{was among those who}} blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>he</b> turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1969, Chinese forces {{started the}} Sino–Soviet border conflict. The Sino–Soviet split had chagrined Premier Alexei Kosygin a great deal, and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> {{refused to accept}} its irrevocability; he briefly visited Beijing in 1969 due to the {{increase}} of tension between the USSR and China. By the early 1980s, both the Chinese and the Soviets were issuing statements calling for a normalisation of {{relations between the two}} states. The conditions given to the Soviets by the Chinese were the reduction of Soviet military presence in the Sino–Soviet border and the withdrawal of Soviets troops in Afghanistan and the Mongolian People's Republic and to end their support for the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. Brezhnev responded in his March 1982 speech in Tashkent where he called for the normalisation of relations. Full Sino–Soviet normalisations of relations would prove to take years, until the last Soviet ruler, Mikhail Gorbachev came to power.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson {{had four}} {{pictures}} {{included in the}} Second Exhibition of the London Group held in March 1915. Nevinson's Futurist painting, Returning to the Trenches, and the sculpture The Rock Drill by Jacob Epstein received the most attention and greatest praise in reviews of the show. After his father received assurances {{that he would not}} be posted abroad, Nevinson enlisted as a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps and spent the rest of 1915 working at the Third London General Hospital in Wandsworth. Despite its name, the 3rd LGH was a specialist centre for the treatment of both shell shock and severe facial injuries. Nevinson worked there as an orderly and as a labourer helping build roads and fit out new wards. Sometimes he would be sent to Charing Cross to meet, and unload, the hospital trains arriving from France and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> worked on a ward for mental patients. Nevinson married Kathleen Knowlman on 1 November 1915 at Hampstead Town Hall and, after a week-long honeymoon, he reported back to the RAMC but was invalided out of the service in January 1916 with acute rheumatic fever.|$|E
