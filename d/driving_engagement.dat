40|$|One {{reason that}} young novice drivers remain {{statistically}} over-represented in road deaths is their rate of engagement in risky driving. Prominent contributing factors include driver’s age, sex, personality, risk perception, and their driving experience. This study applied reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST, specifically reward sensitivity and punishment sensitivity) to predict young novice drivers’ perceived risk and self-reported risky <b>driving</b> <b>engagement,</b> while accounting for potential influences of age, sex, and driving experience. Drivers (N = 643, 490 females, 17 – 25 years, M = 20. 02, SD = 2. 32) who held an Australian driver’s license (P 1, P 2, or Open) anonymously completed an online survey containing the Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale, the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire, and {{a measure of}} perceived risk of driving-related behaviours. A path analytic model derived from RST showed that perceived risk had the strongest negative association with reported risky <b>driving</b> <b>engagement,</b> followed by reward sensitivity (positive association). Respondent’s age and reward sensitivity were associated with perceived risk. Age, reward sensitivity, and perceived risk were associated with reported engagement in risky driving behaviours. Driver sex only had direct paths with RST variables, and through reward sensitivity, indirect paths to perceived risk, and reported risky driving. Neither punishment sensitivity nor driving experience {{contributed significantly to the}} model. Implications and applications of the model, and the unique set of variables examined, are discussed in relation to road safety interventions and driver training.

Participants {{are paid to}} try a game for several minutes, at which point they can quit or continue to play voluntarily with no further compensation. Engagement is measured by both actual play duration and a projection users make about how long others will play. Using Gaussian process surrogate-based optimization, we conduct efficient experiments to identify game design characteristics that lead to maximal engagement. We study two games requiring trajectory planning, the difficulty of each is determined by a three-dimensional continuous design space.

In this paper we study link prediction with explanations for user recommendation in social networks. For this prob-lem we propose WTFW (“Who to Follow and Why”), a stochastic topic model for link prediction over directed and nodes-attributed graphs. Our model not only predicts links, but for each predicted link it decides whether it is a“topical” or a “social ” link, and depending on this decision it produces a di↵erent type of explanation. A topical link is recommended between a user interested in a topic and a user authoritative in that topic: the expla-nation {{in this case is}} a set of binary features describing the topic responsible of the link creation. A social link is rec-ommended between users which share a large social neigh-borhood: in this case the explanation is the set of neighbors which {{are more likely to be}} responsible for the link creation.

40|$|Discussion of {{consumer}} brand engagement within the broader brand management literature adopts largely a psychological view for conceiving {{the nature of}} the construct. As a result, little focus has been devoted to consumer brand engagement behaviours – an aspect that has high managerial relevance. Of particular relevance are the challenges of establishing appropriate measures and better understanding the drivers of brand engagement behaviours. With the aim of addressing these challenges, this paper presents a theoretically-grounded and empirically-validated measure {{of consumer}} engagement behaviours based on the Actual Brand Engagement framework proposed by brand experts. This paper first establishes the framework’s suitability given the literature on engagement behaviours. The framework is conceptualised through demonstrating the importance of consumer brand knowledge, category involvement and corporate-level associations in <b>driving</b> <b>engagement</b> behaviours, thereby accommodating the role of brand-, category- and corporate-level factors. Using data collected from Australian consumers, the framework is empirically established by demonstrating: (1) the validity of the Actual Brand Engagement framework for measuring engagement behaviours and (2) the predictive validity in explaining a consumer’s willingness to pay a price premium. Cumulatively, this study addresses both the academic and managerial need for guidance as to how to best measure and influence brand engagement behaviours.

40|$|Customer-brand {{engagement}} {{is emerging}} as an influential area of modern marketing. Yet, the domain is {{at an early stage}} of development, reliant on conceptual reasoning. The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide clarity in the domain and to develop an integrated customer-brand engagement model. Customer-brand engagement is conceptualised and empirically supported as a psychological state, distinct to behavioural manifestations, which are considered a consequence of customer-brand engagement. The proposed model conceptualises two contributors to customer-brand engagement, namely a firm-led platform for <b>driving</b> <b>engagement</b> and customer-centred influences. A quantitative approach using structural equation modelling supports the hypotheses. The empirical assessment is measured across both product and service brands, with model support in both contexts. The empirical contribution of the firm-led platform for engagement provides insight for practitioners as to how they may actionably influence customer-brand engagement, whereas the demonstrated consequences highlight the real benefits for organisations in doing so. The model measures the impact of customer-brand engagement upon brand value and brand loyalty, demonstrating the customer’s role in value creation. The research appears to be the first to empirically measure both firm-led and customer-centred antecedents to customer-brand engagement in a comprehensive model, offering a significant contribution to the domain.

40|$|Customer {{engagement}} {{has been}} defined as “the customer’s behavioral manifestations that have a brand or firm focus, beyond purchase, resulting from motivational drivers” (van Doorn et al. 2010, p. 254). The term is often used to refer to creating experiences that allow companies to build deeper, more meaningful and sustainable interactions with their customers (The Economist 2007). While practitioners have been very interested in customer engagement as it is believed to lead to loyalty, academic interest toward customer engagement as a separate construct has been somewhat limited (van Doorn et al. 2010). This research extends the literature on customer engagement by looking at internal and external motivational factors <b>driving</b> <b>engagement</b> and by showing that individual and brand characteristics affect consumer inclination to engage. This dissertation consists of two essays. Essay 1 presents a typology of customer engagement behaviors based on perceived motivational benefits driving those behaviors. This typology will be useful to marketers as it outlines important benefits derived from engaging in an extensive list of engagement behaviors and suggests how to motivate groups of behaviors based on salient benefits. In addition, the typology can be extended to new social media networks which may become available in the future. Further, understanding what motivational benefits are important for different groups of behaviors is key in order to encourage desired engagement behaviors. Essay 2 examines the effect of individual and brand personality on customer engagement. In particular, we explore how individual attachment style impacts one’s likelihood to engage with brands. We also study whether consumer perceptions of the brand as sincere or exciting affect customer engagement and brand attachment. Further, we examine the role of brand familiarity on the relationship between brand personality, attachment style, and engagement. Essay 1 draws upon the Uses and Gratifications Framework (Blumler and Katz 1974; Katz et al. 1974) which has been used to explain various engagement behaviors including participation in virtual communities, social networking, and blogs (Raacke and Bonds-Raacke 2008). We apply this framework to understand a wider range of customer engagement behaviors. In addition, we extend the four benefits comprising the framework (cognitive, social integrative, personal integrative, and hedonic), to include an additional type of benefit — economic benefits. This essay contributes to the theory on customer engagement by creating a typology of engagement behaviors. Currently, marketers are concerned with increasing engagement as a whole, but due to the broad scope of this construct, it might be more effective to target specific clusters of engagement behaviors instead. Essay 2 examines the effect of individual and brand personality on customer engagement behaviors. This essay makes three primary theoretical contributions. First, it begins to shed light on {{what are some of the}} personality characteristics differentiating engaged consumers. In particular, this essay shows that consumers with secure attachment styles tend to be more engaged than consumers with anxious attachment styles. Second, this research also contributes to the literature on brand relationships: we explore whether the way consumers relate to others mirrors the way they relate to brands. Last, to our knowledge, the effect of brand personality on customer engagement has not been examined. This essay has several managerial implications. First, it helps marketers identify personality characteristics that differentiate consumers that are more likely to engage. In addition, this essay also identifies some important brand characteristics that draw consumers to engage. This dissertation is one of the first attempts to use an integrative approach toward examining online customer engagement behaviors. Previous studies have either focused on one specific behavior or have conceptually discussed customer engagement. In this research, we create a typology of customer engagement by categorizing the different engagement behaviors on the basis of their perceived benefits. By classifying an extensive list of engagement behaviors with respect to their perceived motivational benefits, we create a nuanced typology of engagement behaviors which contributes to the theory on customer engagement. We also show that individual attachment style and brand personality affect customer engagement. In particular, we show that consumers with secure attachment style are more likely to engage with brands compared to consumers with anxious attachment style. Last, this research shows that brand familiarity is an important factor affecting engagement especially for consumers who have anxious attachment style...|$|E

This paper provides an evaluation of, and lessons learned from three water management engagement processes, and uses this assessment to offer a framework for stakeholder engagement. The Stakeholder Engagement Wheel framework is centered on a bridging organization that ensures that the process continues to move forward, and a steering committee that guides and changes activities according to stakeholder interests and concerns. Around the Stakeholder Engagement Wheel are four steps designed to examine iteratively the water management issue <b>driving</b> the <b>engagement</b> process and expand the sphere of interests involved.

The construct of management was measured {{in the framework of}} LMX and organisational processes in the framework of organisational climate. Based on existing literature, a Likert scale survey was designed and distributed, resulting in a sample of 156 responses. The survey assessed respondents level of engagement, perception of their respective organisation and perception of their direct manager. The responses were analysed in SPSS, using a factor analysis to test whether each of the constructs formed one component, the result of which was that each construct was a reliable measure. Secondly, a multiple regression analysis was conducted, the results of which showed that organisational processes are more highly correlated with employee engagement and that the construct organisational processes has a higher b value, indicating that it is a better driver of engagement. Finally, within the construct of organisational processes, each of the survey questions were analysed to identify which aspects had the lowest responses.

Many studies have linked it {{to a host}} of organizational outcomes, ranging from organizational productivity, employees attrition, customer satisfaction, profitability and more. However, various industry reports from the likes of Aon Hewitt, Gallup International and SHRM have all reported disturbing down trends of engagement globally. As more global organizations shift works to cheaper offshore destinations, the challenge to dealing with employees that are geographical dispersed and culturally diverse further aggravated the issue of engagement. Malaysia is rated among the top three offshore destinations in the world together with India and China. Although there has been much literature on employee engagement in the context of offshore and outsource industry, the Malaysian perspective seems to be lacking. The aim {{of this study is to}} look at the factors <b>driving</b> employee <b>engagement</b> in captive offshore IT companies in Malaysia. Therefore, existing literature was counted upon to develop a sound conceptual framework around the construct of job characteristics, employee demographics, organizational culture of participation/involvement and internal communications to induce employee engagement.

40|$|Background: Driving {{cessation}} {{in later}} life is associated with depression. This study examines if social support can buffer {{the negative effects of}} driving cessation on older women 2 ̆ 7 s mental health. Methods: Participants were drawn from the 1921 - 1926 cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health (ALSWH) and included 4, 075 older women (aged 76 - 87 years) who drove at baseline, following them for three years to assess driving cessation. The outcome variable was mental health, measured by the mental health index (MHI) of the SF- 36. The explanatory variables were social support factors, including social interaction, whether the women were living alone or with others, and engagement in social activities. Control variables included age, country of birth, area of residence, ability to manage on income, marital status, and general health. Results: Main effect results showed that poor mental health was predicted by driving cessation, low levels of social interaction, and non-engagement in social activities. There was a significant interaction effect of driving status by social activities engagement on mental health. Women who remained active in their engagement of social activities were able to maintain a good level of mental health despite <b>driving</b> cessation. Conclusion: <b>Engagement</b> and participation in social activities can help older women who stopped driving maintain a good level of mental health...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{conducted}} {{as a case study}} for the brand Milda. It aims to investigate what Milda can do in order to increase the engagement and co-creation among their consumers at their website. Milda has a user-generated recipe section inside their website they want the consumers to interact with and contribute with content to. The study was conducted using a mixed methodology containing interviews with consumers, usability tests, a survey distributed on Milda’s Facebook page, a review of Milda’s current website, and a short benchmark. Furthermore, the study was based on a thoroughly made literature review over previous studies made regarding the subject. The findings from the study showed that consumers tend to be more willing to co-create with companies they can identify with and are passionate about. Engaged consumers also advocates the brand and connects new consumers to its products. Presence from the company in co-creation processes is highly important to engage and satisfy the consumers. Social aspects in form of communication and interaction with other users are main <b>driving</b> factors for <b>engagement</b> in digital media. For Milda {{to increase the amount of}} content at their website shared by their consumers, they have to make some improvements with the site in order to provide a better user experience. Since the social aspect is important to gain engaged consumers, Milda also has to increase the traffic to the site...|$|R
40|$|The Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale (the BYNDS, Scott-Parker et al., 2010) is a {{reliable}} and valid self-report 44 -item instrument which explores the frequency of a breadth of risky driving behaviours which appear to place young and novice drivers at increased risk of road crash injury. As {{part of a larger}} collaborative research project, the Australian-developed BYNDS was piloted in a sample of 20 young New Zealand drivers (n = 14 aged 16 - 18 years, 9 males; n = 6 aged 19 - 24 years, 2 males). The wording of 21 BYNDS items was modified to reflect the cultural context of the participating New Zealand drivers. The refined BYNDS was applied in a sample of 325 young drivers (n = 116 aged 16 - 18 years, 65 males; n = 209 aged 19 - 24 years, 98 males), and the factor structure examined, including exploratory factor analysis for each gender. The 5 -factor structure of the BYNDS was supported, with young drivers reporting considerable <b>engagement</b> in risky <b>driving</b> exposure, moderate <b>engagement</b> in transient violations and mood-related driving, and less fixed violations and driving misjudgements. Risky driving exposure was predictive of self-reported crash involvement for both males and females, suggesting targeted intervention regarding when, and the circumstances under which, the young driver is on the road...|$|R
50|$|Koo Chi-Ming (Alan Tam) is a life-insurance {{investigator}} who while <b>driving</b> to his <b>engagement</b> party, loses {{control of}} his car almost running over a young girl, Siu-Yu (Ni Shu-Chun). Later upon arriving at his party {{he and his father}} (Bill Tung) begin being henpecked by his mother (Tang Pik-wan) and his fiancée Ivy (Cecilia Yip). Later after the party has ended, everyone decides to have some fun with a Ouija board by attempting to talk to a spirit. Chi-Ming's little brother explains that after they are finished they must send the spirit back, otherwise the person last holding the saucer will be haunted by the spirit. Elsewhere, Siu-Yu is on the roof of her apartment with her goddaughter Mimi drying clothes when Siu-Yu notices that Mimi is very close to the edge rushing forward to grab her, Siu-Yu's foot accidentally lands on a skateboard which sends her {{over the edge of the}} roof to her death. Back at the house, as soon as Siu-Yu dies, the saucer begins to show signs of movement and points out the name of the recently deceased Siu-Yu. The saucer then begins to circle violently around the board and everyone is thrown backwards, apart from Chi-Ming, who holds on until the last movement at which point the saucer flips over to reveal a small spot of blood indicating he will be haunted.|$|R
40|$|In a {{world that}} is {{changing}} both in terms of the global nature of work and the diversity of the workforce, engaged employees may be a key to competitive advantage. Failure to effectively engage employees can result in wasted resources, sub optimal organisational performance, and deteriorating employee morale. On the other hand, successfully engaging and committing employees can result in higher levels of organisational performance as well as higher levels of job satisfaction, both of which are much needed in todayâ€™s environment. Employee Engagement is critical for organisational success and itâ€™s a strong predictor of organisational commitment. The {{purpose of the study was}} to explore employee engagement among Higher Education Institution workers and its impact on organisational commitment. This study adopted the quantitative research approach particularly the correlational design. An explanatory-descriptive survey design was used as the strategy inquiry. This prompted the use of questionnaires; in this case, standardized instruments were used. The Gallup Worker Audit (GWA) by Gallup was used to gauge employee engagement. The Organisational Commitment Questionnaire by Allen and Meyer was used to measure organisational commitment. The total sample constituted 142 employees drawn from three HEIs. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) for demographic characteristics, frequencies for engagement levels, chi-square tests for association between job posting (teaching versus non-teaching) and employee engagement, Pearsonâ€™s correlation between employee engagement and organisational commitment and regression analysis for engagement drivers. The outcomes of the research revealed the levels of engagement within HEIs at critical lows, with only 33. 8 % representing employees with high levels of engagement while the remaining 66. 2 % have low levels of engagement. The findings also indicated that employee engagement can indeed act as a predictor of organisational commitment with the two sets of score correlated moderately and positively r =. 607, p <. 05. Job posting (teaching versus non-teaching) proved to have no association with employee engagement. The twelve drivers from Gallup Work Audit have an effect in <b>driving</b> employee <b>engagement.</b> The low levels of employee engagement in HEIs calls for managerial attention to drive engagement among employees for organisational success...|$|R
