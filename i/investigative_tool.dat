25|$|UV is an <b>investigative</b> <b>tool</b> at {{the crime}} scene helpful in {{locating}} and identifying bodily fluids such as semen, blood, and saliva. For example, ejaculated fluids or saliva can be detected by high-power UV sources, irrespective of the structure or colour of the surface the fluid is deposited upon.|$|E
25|$|MRI is the <b>investigative</b> <b>tool</b> {{of choice}} for {{neurological}} cancers, as it has better resolution than CT and offers better visualization of the posterior fossa. The contrast provided between grey and white matter makes MRI {{the best choice for}} many conditions of the central nervous system, including demyelinating diseases, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, infectious diseases, and epilepsy. Since many images are taken milliseconds apart, it shows how the brain responds to different stimuli, enabling researchers to study both the functional and structural brain abnormalities in psychological disorders. MRI also is used in mri-guided stereotactic surgery and radiosurgery for treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations, and other surgically treatable conditions using a device known as the N-localizer.|$|E

25|$|Men are {{affected}} {{three times as}} often as women. There is also marked geographic variation in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy throughout the world. It {{is the most common}} glomerular disease in the Far East and Southeast Asia, accounting for almost half of all the patients with glomerular disease. However, it accounts for only about 25% of the proportion in European and about 10% among North Americans, with African–Americans having a very low prevalence of about 2%. However, a confounding factor in this analysis is the existing policy of screening and use of kidney biopsy as an <b>investigative</b> <b>tool.</b> School children in Japan undergo routine urinalysis (as do army recruits in Singapore) and any suspicious abnormality is pursued with a kidney biopsy, which might partly explain the high observed incidence of IgA nephropathy in those countries.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} <b>investigative</b> <b>tool</b> at the player's disposal is the Voight-Kampff machine, which tests {{people to}} determine if they are replicants. Usually, Voight-Kampff tests are automatically triggered at certain predetermined points in the game, although on occasion, the player has the option of administering a test. The test depicts a close-up of the subject's eye, and features three needles. The further the top needle moves to the right, the more likely the subject is a replicant; the further the bottom needle moves to the right, {{the more likely they are}} human. The third needle is on a sweeping axis and measures the intensity of the questions (for every question the player can choose low, medium or high intensity), and the pressure felt by the subject. If the player pushes the subject too far, by asking too many high intensity questions, the test will end before a definite result can be obtained. If the player determines with certainty whether a subject is or is not a replicant, the test ends automatically. The player must then decide what course of action to take, with the decision influencing the rest of the storyline; for example, if a subject tests positive as a replicant, the player can kill them, attempt to arrest them, or let them go.|$|E

40|$|Indoor {{air quality}} {{problems}} are diverse and often complex. Adverse {{indoor air quality}} problems can exist which create symptomatic conditions for building occupants. Often, the exact cause, or causes, of the substandard indoor air quality are unknown. Therefore, an investigative approach must usually be taken to identify the source(s) of the air quality problem, and if present, air contaminant concentrations. As the general public becomes {{more aware of the}} problems associated with poor indoor air quality conditions, an associated increase in air quality evaluation requests can be expected. This paper discusses some of the various <b>investigative</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques that can be utilized to identify air quality contaminants when performing an indoor air quality evaluation. These <b>investigative</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques can be used to develop a site specific list of possible contaminants and their sources, and can then be used to determine which contaminants are, in fact, present in adverse concentrations. Some of the <b>investigative</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques to be discussed in this paper include the following: visual inspections and site observations, information searches, review of building construction, review of ventilation systems, interviews, low and high volume sampling pumps, flow and oxygen meters, portable photoionization and flame ionization detectors (PID & FID), various types of vapor detector tubes, and gas chromatograph/mass spectrophotometer (GC/MS) analysis. This paper will be an introductory overview of the above listed <b>investigative</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques.

2500|$|The {{police have}} used Oyster card data as an <b>investigative</b> <b>tool,</b> and this use is increasing. On 13 April 2006, TfL stated that [...] "Between August 2004 and March 2006 TfL's Information Access and Compliance Team {{received}} 436 requests {{from the police}} for Oyster card information. Of these, 409 requests were granted and the data were released to the police." [...] However, in response to another request in February 2012, [...] "TfL said this had happened 5,295 times in 2008, 5,359 in 2009, 5,046 in 2010, and a record 6,258 in 2011".|$|E
2500|$|In Bilski v.

Rather than being an exclusive test for eligibility, the machine-or-transformation test is [...] "a useful and important clue, an <b>investigative</b> <b>tool,</b> for determining whether some claimed inventions are processes under §101.

2500|$|U.Va. {{responded by}} {{questioning}} Cuccinelli's motives, stating that his demand was [...] "aimed squarely at Dr. Mann's scientific conclusions" [...] {{and that more}} than a third of the attorney general's brief [...] "is devoted to challenging and criticizing the research and conclusions of Dr. Mann and his co-authors." [...] The University argued that given the importance of protecting academic freedom the court should not permit the attorney general to exceed his statutory power, and that [...] "such a potentially invasive <b>investigative</b> <b>tool</b> should not be permitted to be used to target academics merely because the Attorney General disputes the legitimacy of their research and conclusions." [...] It noted that four of the grants queried by Cuccinelli were received from the federal government and were therefore not covered by the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act, while the fifth was awarded before the statute was enacted in 2003. U.Va. argued that much of the information demanded by Cuccinelli had nothing to do with any of the five grants and was [...] "not even remotely tailored to an investigation of a potential [...] investigation." [...] The presiding judge, Cheryl V. Higgins, agreed to stay Cuccinelli's demand pending further oral hearings due to take place in late August.|$|E

However, it {{has been difficult to}} design inhibitors for use in determining their individual roles due to the conserved active site. Interestingly, each protease has an endogenous inhibitor that forms an α-helix at the prime side of the active site. We developed a new method for stabilizing α-helices using natural amino acids that allowed us to make small peptides into α-helical inhibitors. We were then able to use structure based design to turn these α-helices into specific inhibitors and probes for use in understanding the proteases 2 ̆ 7 roles in various diseases and cell processes.

2500|$|His {{political}} comedy show, The Mark Thomas Comedy Product (later renamed {{as simply}} The Mark Thomas Product, to reflect its increasing political agenda) on Channel 4 earned him criticism from politicians but {{was seen by}} critics as a crucial <b>investigative</b> <b>tool.</b> In one edition, Thomas investigated the practice of avoiding inheritance tax by declaring art, furniture, homes and land available for public viewing. After discovering that Conservative MP Nicholas Soames was claiming tax relief on a [...] "three-tier mahogany buffet with partially reeded slender balustrade upright supports" [...] on this basis, but without making any arrangements for the furniture to be inspected by the public, Thomas invented a 'National Soames Day' on which hundreds of people made appointments to see the furniture. Soames subsequently decided to pay the tax on the item and Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, changed the law. In 2015, Thomas told The Independents Adam Jacques: [...] "I {{try to find the}} good in my enemies. It's not unusual {{to be able to get}} on with people despite what they are doing being awful.
