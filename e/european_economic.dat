Previously the two major airlines Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Braathens SAFE each had their own routes, but from 1994 both established themselves on several of the main-haul routes.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, the <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> Community and Euratom were {{established}} in 1958 by the Treaties of Rome. The Common Assembly was shared by all three communities (which had separate executives) and it renamed itself the European Parliamentary Assembly. The first meeting was held on 19 March 1958 having been set up in Luxembourg, it elected Schuman as its president and on 13 May it rearranged itself to sit according to political ideology rather than nationality. This {{is seen as the}} birth of the modern European Parliament, with Parliament's 50 years celebrations being held in March 2008 rather than 2002.|$|E

His main work in opposition was as a member of select committee on nationalised industries, where his knowledge and inquisitorial skills won him the respect of the committee's left-wing chair Ian Mikardo. In February 1972 he called for employment for miners who had been made redundant, and became Secretary of the Parliamentary Labour Party's Northern Group in 1973.|$|E

During the Croatian War of Independence, Croatia obtained arms from several countries (including Hungary), despite a United Nations-imposed arms embargo. As of December 2011, Hungary and Croatia have 96 treaties and agreements in force regulating a wide range of activities and relations (including diplomatic, cultural, economic, energy, transport, education, minority and other issues). Furthermore, Hungary supported the Croatian NATO membership request and Croatian accession to the European Union.|$|E

5|$|In 1840, Britain intervened and {{returned}} {{control of the}} Levant to the Ottomans in return for further capitulations. The death of Aqil Agha marked the last local challenge to Ottoman centralization in Palestine, and beginning in the 1860s, Palestine underwent an acceleration in its socio-economic development, due to its incorporation into the global, and particularly <b>European,</b> <b>economic</b> pattern of growth. The beneficiaries of this process were Arabic-speaking Muslims and Christians who emerged as a new layer within the Arab elite. The end of the 19th century saw the beginning of Zionist immigration and {{the revival of the}} Hebrew language and culture. The movement was publicly supported by Great Britain during World War I with the Balfour Declaration of 1917.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, the British and French prime ministers, Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet, {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome, which established the <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> Community, the precursor to the European Union. In November 1956, Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal. Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 the Treaties of Rome {{established}} two, similar, communities {{creating a}} common market (<b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> Community) and promoting atomic energy co-operation (Euratom). The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament, however {{they had a}} separate Council and High Authority, which was called the Commission in these Communities. The {{reason for this is}} the different relationship between the Commission and Council. At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranationalism and wanted to limit the powers of the High Authority in the new Communities, giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive.|$|E

The <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> Community donated about $376,300 in assistance. The government of Canada provided $142,490 worth of aid, and the government of West Germany donated $21,740. The British Red Cross and the United Kingdom government collectively donated $302,850 to the country, mostly for 3helicopters to transport relief and medical teams.

5|$|Independence from Europe {{has called}} for stricter {{immigration}} policy to be implemented in the UK, but has refused to set a statistical migration target. It supports an 'Australian-style' points-based system to regulate immigration once the UK has left the <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> Area (EEA), citing pressures on population growth, housing and infrastructure. Foreigners would also face more stringent rules once they had arrived; temporary visitors would have to carry identification at all times, as well as reside in the UK for at least 10 years before becoming eligible for British citizenship. Such measures, the party hopes, would justify the reintroduction of the country's work permit scheme.|$|E
5|$|Recovery {{began with}} the mid-1948 {{currency}} reform in Western Germany, and was sped up by the liberalisation of <b>European</b> <b>economic</b> policy that the Marshall Plan (1948–1951) both directly and indirectly caused.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{analysis}} of technological change by cliometricians. It focuses on lessons about total factor productivity (TFP) from growth accounting and on aspects of social capability that are conducive to the effective assimilation of new technology. Key messages are that when TFP growth is very rapid this typically involves reductions in inefficiency not just technological advance and that even really important new technologies have small initial effects on aggregate productivity. Incentive structures matter greatly for the adoption of new technology but social capability is not independent of the technological epoch as the ICT era has emphasized to <b>Europeans.</b> <b>economic</b> growth; growth accounting; social capability; technological change...|$|R
