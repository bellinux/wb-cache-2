50|$|In September 1982, Touré held a {{news conference}} proudly proclaiming that there were no more {{political}} prisoners being held in the country. He could not explain the fate of approximately 2900 people arrested since 1969 who remained unaccounted for. Reports of the number of prisoners at Boiro continued to range from several hundred to thousands. Torture methods reportedly used at the prison included bondage, <b>forced</b> <b>burning</b> with cigarettes, and electric shocks applied to the head and genitals. After Touré's death in March 1984, major political changes were afoot.|$|E

It became an Act of the Parliament of India with the {{enactment}} of The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 in 1988. The Act seeks to prevent Sati practice or the voluntary or <b>forced</b> <b>burning</b> or burying alive of widows, and to prohibit glorification of this action through the observance of any ceremony, the participation in any procession, {{the creation of a}} financial trust, the construction of a temple, or any actions to commemorate or honor the memory of a widow who committed sati.|$|E

The next day, American forces crossed the bridge and captured San Isidro, which had been the temporary seat of Aguinaldo's insurgent government. Aguinaldo had already left before the town fell, however, taking with him 13 American captives.|$|R
50|$|The {{town has}} a {{significant}} place in American history. James Rumsey made a public demonstration of a steamboat in 1787 on the nearby Potomac River. Shepherdstown was proposed as the National Capital in 1790, losing to Alexandria, Virginia, and Georgetown, Maryland, at the tidal headwaters of the Potomac. During the Civil War, Shepherdstown was in a pivotal position, with Confederate <b>forces</b> <b>burning</b> the covered bridge over the Potomac in 1861, then using nearby Pack Horse Ford {{to and from the}} Battle of Antietam. The entire town became a field hospital following this action. Later, Union troops occupied the town to preserve the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad link to the west.|$|R
50|$|In Masters of Rome, {{a series}} of seven novels by the Australian writer Colleen McCullough, Porcia appears {{as a child in}} Caesar's Women, as a {{teenager}} in Caesar and as a young woman in The October Horse. Porcia is portrayed as being, first a rabid unthinking follower of republican values, then as a raving maniac, and then as perhaps totally insane. Servilia, who abuses her constantly, later writes to Brutus before the battle of Philippi to inform him that Porcia went mad and killed herself by swallowing live coals. However Brutus recognizes that {{it is more likely that}} Servilia murdered Porcia by <b>forcing</b> <b>burning</b> coals down her throat. Given the vicious character of Servilia in the novel, this murder is perfectly believable.|$|R

50|$|In {{response}} to rumors, fearful peasants armed themselves in self-defense and, in some areas, attacked manor houses. The {{content of the}} rumors differed from region to region - in some areas {{it was believed that}} a foreign <b>force</b> was <b>burning</b> the crops in the fields, while in other areas it was believed that robbers were burning buildings. Fear of the peasant revolt was a determining factor in the decision to abolish feudalism.|$|R

50|$|When Christian {{conversion}} {{efforts on}} the part of Granada's first archbishop, Hernando de Talavera, were less than successful, Cardinal Jimenez de Cisneros took stronger measures: with <b>forced</b> conversions, <b>burning</b> Islamic texts, and prosecuting many of Granada's Muslims. In response to these and other violations of the Treaty, Granada's Muslim population rebelled in 1499. The revolt lasted until early 1501, giving the Castilian authorities an excuse to void the terms of the Treaty for Muslims. In 1501 the terms of the Treaty of Granada protections were abandoned.|$|R

During {{the period of}} Nazi control of Lithuania (along with {{indigenous}} Lithuanian collaborators) he successfully photographed various scenes of life and its difficulties in the ghetto in clandestine circumstances. Kadish constructed cameras by which he could photograph through the buttonhole of his coat or over a window sill.

5|$|Both sides {{sought the}} decisive engagement, {{for which they}} had amassed, {{according}} to some estimates, between 70 and 90 percent of all galleys in existence in the Mediterranean at the time. The fleets were roughly balanced: the Ottoman fleet was larger with 300 ships to the 200 Christian ones, but the Christian ships were sturdier; both fleets carried some 30,000 troops, and while the Christians had twice as many cannons, the Ottomans compensated by a large and skilled corps of archers. On 7 October, the two fleets engaged in a battle off Lepanto, {{which resulted in a}} crushing victory for the Christian fleet, while the Ottoman fleet was effectively destroyed, losing some 25,000–35,000 men in addition to some 12,000 Christian galley slaves who were freed. In popular perception, the battle itself became {{known as one of the}} decisive turning points in the long Ottoman-Christian struggle, as it ended the Ottoman naval hegemony established after the Battle of Preveza in 1538. Its immediate results however were minimal: the harsh winter that followed precluded any offensive actions on behalf of the Holy League, while the Ottomans used the respite to hurriedly rebuild their naval strength. At the same time, Venice suffered losses in Dalmatia, where the Ottomans attacked Venetian possessions: the island of Hvar was raided by the Ottoman fleet, with the Turkish <b>forces</b> <b>burning</b> down the towns of Hvar, Stari Grad and Vrboska.|$|R

40|$|The {{trend toward}} {{hospitalization}} of birth {{has a long}} history in Costa Rica and currently approximately 98 % of births take place in the clinical setting. Impoverished rural areas, like the town of Buenos Aires, lag behind national trends and only recently has birth moved from the home to the hospital. Costa Rica's midwife certification program co-opted rural midwives as bridges to biomedicalization, responsible for both pushing women into the biomedical setting and filling the gaps left by a limited national health care system. Despite the eventual illegalization of key practices and of home birth itself, local use of midwives' services continues, albeit with local demands that have transformed midwives into bridges to biomedical care in ways unanticipated by and invisible to national programmers. Midwives provide key services like prenatal massage, treatment of pregnancy crises, and attending unforeseen home births and women unable to afford the modest costs of hospitalization. Yet, midwives report increasing dissatisfaction and the desire to stop providing services in their communities. Practices like prenatal massage are in demand, but are no longer embedded in a system of local exchange that is socially and economically meaningful. Midwives blame their clientele for their dissatisfaction, but directly link these changes to the notions of professionalism, compensation, and changing community values. Thus, the social relationship between midwives and their clients must also be understood as a destructive <b>force</b> <b>burning</b> midwifery as a bridge to safe birth. In this essay, I argue that the process of both remodeling and subsequently destroying midwifery practices begun in the formal health care sector at the national level continues at the local level through changing values and meanings associated with midwives' practices.

50|$|After {{that point}} on, however, {{territorial}} expansions by Lin Shihong were rarely mentioned in historical accounts; rather, contractions were mentioned.
