40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} give {{some insight into the}} unique and combined effects of living situation, loneliness, depressive symptoms, the preference for solitude and emotional <b>dampeing</b> on the wellbeing of older adults. An interviewed sample of 164 Dutch adults aged 70 and over was used for regression analyses. Indicating that loneliness predicts lower life-satisfaction and more depressive symptoms. Furthermore, living in a care facility was associated with more loneliness and more depressive symptoms in older adults. These findings correspond with earlier research. However, although expected, the preference for solitude and emotional dampening of negative emotions did not predict life satisfaction or depressive symptoms. It is therefore important to investigate whether emotional dampening is actually an existing process in the aging group and maybe it manifests differently than we expected it to. The preference for solitude should be examined cross cultures, because this seems to have different effects in different countries. A last implication for future research is to use a larger group of care facility residents...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that either the nearby astrophysical source or dark matter (DM) annihilation/decay is {{required}} to explain the origin of high energy cosmic ray (CR) e^±, which are measured by many experiments, such as PAMELA and AMS- 02. Recently, the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (<b>DAMPE)</b> collaboration has reported its first result of the total CR e^± spectrum from 25 GeV to 4. 6 TeV with high precision. In this work, we study the DM annihilation and pulsar interpretations of the <b>DAMPE</b> high energy e^± spectrum. In the DM scenario, the leptonic annihilation channels to τ^+τ^-, 4 μ, 4 τ, and mixed charged lepton final states can well fit the <b>DAMPE</b> result, while the μ^+μ^- channel has been excluded. In addition, we find that the mixed charged leptons channel would lead to a sharp drop at ∼ TeV. However, these DM explanations are almost excluded by the observations of gamma-ray and CMB, unless some complicated DM models are introduced. In the pulsar scenario, we analyze 21 nearby known pulsars and assume that {{one of them is the}} primary source of high energy CR e^±. Considering the constraint from the Fermi-LAT observation of the e^± anisotropy, we find that two pulsars are possible to explain the <b>DAMPE</b> data.

40|$|The <b>DAMPE</b> (DArk Matter Particle Explorer) is a {{scientific}} satellite being developed in China, aimed at cosmic ray study, gamma ray astronomy, {{and searching for}} the clue of dark matter particles, with a planned mission period of more than 3 years and an orbit altitude of about 500 km. The BGO Calorimeter, which consists of 308 BGO (Bismuth Germanate Oxid) crystal bars, 616 PMTs (photomultiplier tubes) and 1848 dynode signals, has approximately 32 radiation lengths. It is a crucial sub-detector of the <b>DAMPE</b> payload, with the functions of precisely measuring the energy of cosmic particles from 5 GeV to 10 TeV, distinguishing positrons/electrons and gamma rays from hadron background, and providing trigger information for the whole <b>DAMPE</b> payload. The dynamic range for a single BGO crystal is about 2 ? 105 and there are 1848 detector signals in total. To build such an instrument in space, the major design challenges for the readout electronics come from the large dynamic range, the high integrity inside the very compact structure, the strict power supply budget and the long term reliability to survive the hush environment during launch and in orbit.

We utilize the scalar dark matter (DM) annihilation scenario to explain the <b>DAMPE</b> peak by extending G_SM≡ SU(3) _C × SU(2) _L × U(1) _Y with additional U(1) gauge symmetries while keeping anomaly free to generate χχ→ Z^' Z^'→ℓℓ̅ℓ^'ℓ^', where χ, Z^', ℓ^(^') denote the scalar DM, the new gauge boson and ℓ^(^') =e,μ,τ, respectively, with m_χ∼ m_Z^'∼ 2 × 1. 5 (TeV). We first illustrate that the minimal framework G_SM× U(1) _Y^' with the above mass choices can explain the <b>DAMPE</b> excess but has been excluded by LHC constraints from the Z^' searches. Then we study a non-minimal framework G_SM× U(1) _Y^'× U(1) _Y^" in which U(1) _Y^" mixes with U(1) _Y^'.
