50|$|Mall (born 1937) is a {{professor}} of philosophy and teaches intercultural philosophy and hermeneutics at the university of Munich. He has systematically worked through Indian philosophy and sociology, and views himself to be an insider as well as an outsider due to his Indian heritage and Western education. For Mall <b>interculturality</b> derives from the overlapping of cultures that don't exist on their own. Intercultural philosophy {{is by no means a}} romantic notion for anything non-European but an attitude which has to precede philosophical thinking. Only then comparative philosophy becomes possible. Mall has worked out a hermeneutic he calls 'analogous', which moves between two hermeneutic extremes, namely radical difference and total identity. Working out overlappings despite differences enables to understand other cultures not identical to one's own. Mall pleads for abandonment of any claim to absolute right in theory as well as practice.|$|E

He is additionally president of the Phenomenological Society in Ljubljana and is on the editorial board of a number of journals for philosophy and culture, including Phainomena, Nova revija, Orbis Phaenomenologicus. Since 2005 he has also headed research activities at the Humanistic institute of Nova revija. He has lectured at numerous universities and international symposia.

50|$|ASB is {{possible}} because of the relationships that have been established through CAN. Researchers, farmers, students, and community members make up the network of collaborators who promote food security, food sovereignty, agroecology, and <b>interculturality.</b> ASB gives both {{the students and the}} community exposure to a different culture and a different way of life so that they can learn from one another. According to Freire, before there can exist progress between two communities there must exist a teacher-student, student-teacher relationship. This means that the learning process must be mutual and reciprocal, only then we can fully understand one another. The next step, according to Paulo Freire is not to work for a community but rather with the community to meet their needs and demands. In order to for CAN to continue their progress with the communities in these Latin America, longevity and trust are essential to preserving these relationships and maintaining consistency in their progress.CAN also seeks to produce these relationships with the students and participants of their programs, such as ASB. ASB offers exposure to a distinct way of life with the hope that it sparks an interest to continue exploring what the rest of CAN has to offer here in Santa Cruz and in Latin America. Since CAN is a non-profit organization, its income is based on donations and the income received from Agrocoffee and programs such as ASB. Alternative Spring Break costs $1,500, not including traveler’s insurance and international airfare. This price can be difficult for students to raise, but the reputation that ASB has motivates students to reach the goal. Some students have even decided to return after their first experience in ASB.Long-term impact for ASB is intertwined between CAN and their participants, their international communities, and the students with their host-families. All of these relationships are well valued and essential to continue CAN’s objective.|$|E

Basic interest for exploring different forms of dynamic interaction between performance {{and all kinds of}} environment in which it occurs, as well as transdisciplinarity and <b>interculturality</b> shown in this book are being later developed in large number of Lukić’s essays, studies and texts published in magazines and papers in numerous seminars, symposiums and conferences all over the world.

In this book he researches social, psychosocial and political influences on plays.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the representation of}} <b>interculturality</b> in the media. <b>Interculturality,</b> the interaction between two different cultures, has taken on greater importance {{in the social and}} human sciences. However, in the field of media communications the representation of <b>interculturality</b> has not received much attention. Thus, we are interested in analysing the media representation of <b>interculturality</b> in Spanish television news. We analyse the discursive construction of <b>interculturality</b> in news programs, and we go into depth as to how the conflictual kind of <b>interculturality</b> is represented. To achieve this, critical discourse analysis is used, applying the concepts of lexicalisation, propositional structures, topics, polarisation and focus. Results indicate that in public and private stations alike, <b>interculturality</b> is shown as a polarised interaction between a dominant in-group and a minority out-group, and it is defined by the status quo. However, Spanish television portrays a conflictual <b>interculturality</b> that is not limited to disagreement.
