Is the smallest of those reductions a one or two dimensional group, this will affect the dimension of the orbit space. In {{the case of a}} two dimensional minimal reduction we show that, up to one exceptional case and providing that the orbit space is not a product, the dimension of the orbit space is equal to four. We show that the existence of a one dimensional minimal reduction is equivalent to the existence of a <b>generalized</b> <b>section</b> with one dimensional part in regular orbits.

40|$|The Alekseev-Gröbner lemma is {{combined}} with the theory of modified equations to obtain an a priori estimate for the global error of numerical integrators. This estimate is correct up to a remainder term of order h^ 2 p, where h denotes the step size and p {{the order of the}} method. It is applied to a class of nonautonomous linear oscillatory equations, which includes the Airy equation, thereby improving prior work which only gave the h^p term. Next, nonlinear oscillators whose behaviour is described by the Emden-Fowler equation y" + t^ν y^n = 0 are considered, and global errors committed by Runge-Kutta methods are calculated. Numerical experiments show that the resulting estimates are generally accurate. The main conclusion {{is that we need to}} do a full calculation to obtain good estimates: the behaviour is different from the linear case, it is not sufficient to look only at the leading term, and merely considering the local error does not provide an accurate picture either.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple and {{efficient}} method {{for the analysis of}} shear flexible isotropic and orthotropic composite shells. Classical thin shell constitutive equations used in the explicit finite element code EPSA to model homogenous isotropic shells using "through-the-thickness-integration" and layered orthotropic composite shells [1 – 3, 5] are modified to account for transverse shear deformation. This effect is important in the analysis of thick plates and shells as well as composite laminates, where interlaminar effects matter. Transverse shear stresses are calculated using a linear normal strain distribution, where first the shear forces are calculated and then the stresses are calculated by means of the <b>generalized</b> <b>section</b> properties, i. e., first and second moments of area. The formulation is a generalization of the analytical method of analyzing composite beams. It is simple and computationally inexpensive, and it yields accurate results without employing higher order displacement interpolations. In the case of isotropic shells, the transverse shear stresses are distributed parabolically, based on the assumption of linear normal strain distribution through the thickness and on application of the quadratic shape function to transverse shear strains. The transverse shear stresses are included in the elastic-perfectly plastic yield function of the Huber-Mises-Hencky type...|$|E
40|$|A new beam {{finite element}} is presented, with a <b>generalized</b> <b>section</b> {{constitutive}} law based on damage mechanics and plasticity, to analyse the cyclic structural response of plane frames. Both displacement-based and force-based (FB) approaches are used and compared, {{to demonstrate the}} significant advantages of the FB formulation {{in the presence of}} material non-linearity. In order to overcome the analytical problems and the pathological mesh dependency of the numerical response in the presence of strain-softening post-peak behaviour, a classical non-local regularization procedure is adopted first, based on the integral definition of the associated variable governing the damaging evolution process. Subsequently, for the FB element a new simple regularization technique is proposed based on a selected integration procedure along the element length, which predefines the location of the Gauss points in the beam region, where the localization phenomena take place. As for the other computational aspects, an iterative element state determination is adopted for the FB formulation and a local predictor–corrector algorithm is used to solve the incremental evolution problems of the damage and plastic internal variables. Finally, some examples are shown on simple beams and frames, subjected to monotonically increasing and cyclic loading conditions. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|In many {{engineering}} structures, {{the effects}} of shear and torsional loads are {{an important aspect of}} both the analysis and the design process. These effects are usually neglected in typical framed structures. However, in some relevant cases, such as bridges, shear walls or thin-walled frames, it is essential to account for the shear and torsional loads and their interaction with the other loading conditions to correctly reproduce the structural response. In this framework, the main task is to accurately describe the nonlinear structural response in terms of global behavior and local stress-strain distributions, reproducing the coupling of the stress components and its influence on the global response. This results even more important in large scale structures made of cementitious and/or innovative composite materials, widely adopted in nowadays professional practice. Indeed, these structures usually show degrading mechanisms and softening behavior. Hence, they require sophisticated computational models and ad hoc analysis strategies to predict the structure capacity under severe loading conditions. A standard approach to analyze these structures is the adoption of beam-column finite element (FE) models, which are often preferred with respect to two-dimensional (2 D) plate/shell or three-dimensional (3 D) FEs, because of their efficiency and low computational cost. However, most beam-column FE formulations are based on theclassical Euler-Bernoulli or Timoshenko theory, assuming the cross-sections to remain plane during the loading process. This assumption requires specific corrective measures, when the shear and torsion and the related warping effects are pronounced. This work discusses the simulation of RC members with a 3 D 2 -node beam FE that includes warping effects. The FE formulation in [1] is extended to allow the description of structural members with softening material behavior. The governing equations are derived from a four-field Hu-Washizu variational principle, with independent interpolation of the warping displacement field from the rigid section displacements, the <b>generalized</b> <b>section</b> deformations and the material stress fields. In particular, the warping of the cross-section is described by interpolating the out-of-plane displacement {{with the addition of a}} variable number of local degrees of freedom to those commonly used for the beam FE. The global nonlinear response and the local distributions of strains and stresses are described introducing a fiber cross-section discretization. Hence, the coupling of axial, flexural, shear and torsional effects in terms of material response is automatically taken into account. Focusing on RC structures, the damaging mechanisms of the concrete material is described by adopting a new 3 D nonlinear constitutive relationship with plasticity and damage. This is an enhanced version of that proposed in [2] and introduces the description of the unilateral effects typically appearing in concrete-like materials, due to the crack opening and closure. A Drucker-Prager type plastic model is coupled with a two-parameter isotropic damage model, where two scalar variables are used to describe the damage in tension and compression, respectively. The localization problems and the related mesh-dependency, due to the softening material behavior, are controlled through a regularization technique based on a properly modified nonlocal integral procedure. For beam-column FEs, the nonlocal strain measures are evaluated performing the integration of the local <b>generalized</b> <b>section</b> deformations along the element axis, whereas for 2 D FEs the nonlocal integration is performed considering the generalized membrane/plate deformations. The proposed model is implemented and validated through some correlation studies. These consider the numerical analysis of a series of plain concrete and RC beams subjected to torsional loads and of two RC shear walls. The results are compared with experimental measurements and with those of standard FE beam models...|$|E

Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1900. Introduction: The Kansas coals occur in various shales and all positions, from the Cherokee shales {{at the base}} to the Osage shales, 2000 feet above. The order and position of the strata {{is shown in the}} <b>generalized</b> <b>section</b> figure. The Cherokee shales produce greater quantities of coal than any other shale beds in the whole Coal Measures. From these shales, are obtained the coals of Cherokee and Crawford Counties and nearly all of Labette and Leavenworth Counties. Borings, as of wells, show that the Cherokee shales extend over a considerable area west, and the probability is that coal can be found anywhere under the eastern fifty or seventy five miles of the state. The Labette shales, first in order above the Cherokee shales, contain considerable bituminous matter, but no good bed coal. Above this, we have the Pleasanton shales, which contain large quantities of coal, especially in the lower Pleasanton shales. They probably rank next to the Cherokee shales. The Thayer shales carry a considerable amount of coal, especially in the vicinity of Thayer. The Lane shales, next in importance, have no coal as far as is known. Above this are the Lawrence shales, which produce coal enough to be of commercial importance. In Atchison, Jefferson, Douglas, and Franklin counties, coal is mined from these shales. Above the Lawrence shales, the shale beds contain little or no coal, until the Osage shales are reached. The average thickness of this formation is about 200 feet. It extends across the state, from the north to the south. It is rich in coal, and is extensively mined at Burlingame, Osage City, Carbondale, and Scranton. The quantity and quality varies considerably in different sections...|$|E
