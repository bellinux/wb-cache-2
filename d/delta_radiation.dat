40|$|Knowledge {{of energy}} {{deposition}} in biological cells at nanometer dimensions {{is essential to}} understand the biological effects of radiation. This work {{has resulted in the}} development of a practical tool to study such energy deposition experimentally, at nanometer dimensions. The main contribution of this research is the design of a cylindrical wall-less proportional counter of 1 mm height by 1 mm diameter. A wall-less detector (also called grid-walled detector) overcomes the so-called ??wall effect??, an experimental artifact that introduces distortions in the radiation energy measurements. An important feature of this detector that distinguishes it from other detectors is its modular design. This allows the detector to be repaired or modified, when necessary, without having to completely disassemble it. Novel design techniques were adopted resulting in a functional detector that can simulate cellular sites as small as 10 nanometers, approximately the size of many molecules in the cell. The detector was tested with a 1 microcurie sealed Am- 241 source, which primarily emits monoenergetic alpha particles of energy 5. 57 MeV. Microdosimetric spectra analysis for alpha particles and its delta rays from Am- 241 were performed for simulated site sizes ranging from 500 nm to 10 nm. Initial studies to validate the detector design have confirmed good detector performance. We believe this work will serve as a vital platform for bridging the experimentally measured energy spectra to the biological effects of alpha and <b>delta</b> <b>radiations...</b>|$|R

50|$|A delta ray is {{characterized}} by very fast electrons produced in quantity by alpha particles or other fast energetic charged particles knocking orbiting electrons out of atoms. Collectively, these electrons are defined as <b>delta</b> <b>radiation</b> when they have sufficient energy to ionize further atoms through subsequent interactions on their own. Delta rays appear as branches in the main track of a cloud chamber (See Figs. 1,2). These branches will appear nearer {{the start of the}} track of a heavy charged particle, where more energy is imparted to the ionized electrons.|$|E

40|$|Electrodynamic {{particles}} have {{an exclusive}} physical property that distinguishes them {{from all other}} physical systems. This property is the electrodynamic mass that allows accelerated particles to emit or to absorb energy quanta. Stable particles have a lower speed than the critical speed, when they are accelerated they lose electrodynamic mass and emit energy {{in the shape of}} quanta while when are decelerated they absorb energy quanta and electrodynamic mass. Unstable particles on the contrary have higher speeds than the critical speed; they absorb energy and negative electrodynamic mass when they are accelerated and lose energy and electrodynamic mass when they are decelerated.

50|$|In the Mirror Universe, Tucker is {{the chief}} {{engineer}} of the ISS Enterprise, but is badly disfigured due to exposure from heavy <b>delta</b> ray <b>radiation</b> emanating from his Enterprises engines. This version of Tucker also had {{a sexual relationship with}} the Mirror TPol, who once exploited this relationship in her attempt to sabotage Enterprise; she used a mind meld to implant a posthypnotic suggestion in Tuckers mind. It is implied {{this is not the first}} time she has used him in this way. Tucker is subsequently tortured in the agony booth, but vehemently denies any wrongdoing, insisting that he has always been loyal to the Empire and Archer. In the end, Archer tells Reed to break Tucker before releasing him from the booth, much to Tuckers horror. He later confronts TPol in main engineering and tells her he spent four hours in the booth. This version of Tucker, along with much of the ISS Enterprise crew, travels to the USS Defiant - which had been discovered in the Mirror Universe - and tries to get the ship working to further the Mirror Archers attempt to take over the Terran Empire. Tucker successfully foils a plot by the Mirror Phlox to sabotage key systems aboard Defiant.|$|R
40|$|Very light WIMPs (chi), thermal relics that annihilate late in {{the early}} Universe, change the energy and entropy densities at BBN and at re{{combination}}. BBN, {{in combination with the}} CMB, can remove some of the degeneracies among light WIMPs and equivalent neutrinos, constraining the existence and properties of each. Depending {{on the nature of the}} light WIMP (Majorana or Dirac fermion, real or complex scalar) the joint BBN + CMB analyses set lower bounds to m_chi in the range 0. 5 - 5 MeV (m_chi/m_e > 1 - 10), and they identify best fit values for m_chi in the range 5 - 10 MeV. The joint BBN + CMB analysis finds a best fit value for the number of equivalent neutrinos, Delta N_nu ~ 0. 65, nearly independent of the nature of the WIMP. In the absence of a light WIMP (m_chi > 20 MeV), N_eff = 3. 05 (1 + Delta N_nu / 3). In this case, there is excellent agreement between BBN and the CMB, but the joint fit reveals Delta N_nu = 0. 40 +- 0. 17, disfavoring standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN) (Delta N_nu = 0) at ~ 2. 4 sigma, as well as a sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1) at ~ 3. 5 sigma. The best BBN + CMB joint fit disfavors the absence of dark <b>radiation</b> (<b>Delta</b> N_nu = 0 at ~ 95 % confidence), while allowing for the presence of a sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1 at ~ 1 sigma). For all cases considered here, the lithium problem persists. These results, presented at the TAUP 2013 Conference, are based on Nollett & Steigman (2013).

40|$|Understanding the land–boundary layer–sea {{interactions}} is {{a primary}} target both {{in the context of}} low-level jet (LLJ) development and landscape alterations. This thesis attempts to address and study these interactions in the Middle East. The thesis investigates the summertime LLJ over the Persian Gulf, known as the Shamal. Terrain height, land-sea and novel mountain slope sensitivity experiments were conducted and compared with a control run. It was found that the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model accurately simulates the LLJ’s vertical structure, nocturnal features and strong diurnal oscillation of the wind, and that orography, mountain slope and land/sea breezes determine the Shamal diurnal variation of wind speed and wind direction. The Iranian mountain range not only channels the northwesterly winds but also provides a barrier for the easterly monsoon airflow. The steep slopes cause increased wind speeds; however, the shallow slopes reveal a stronger diurnally varying wind direction due to larger diurnal heating of the sloping terrain. The land breeze and the lower friction over the sea increase the intensity of the nocturnal jet over the Gulf. To determine the effects of the Nile Delta man-induced greening on local climate, the WRF model was used to compare control simulations, which employ the present-day Nile Delta landscape, with desertification experiments in which the Nile Delta is replaced by desert. It was found that the low surface albedo of the present-day agricultural Nile <b>Delta</b> increases net <b>radiation,</b> which in turn raises potential evapotranspiration (PET). This suggests that agricultural use increases the water demand by enhancing PET. Non-local effects were also examined. It was found that a frontal system over the eastern Mediterranean Sea, associated with a storm event, is shifted farther away from the coast. This shift is attributed to a stronger land breeze in the present-day land-cover. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|BL Lac {{objects are}} the best {{candidates}} to study the jet properties since their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are less contaminated by the emission from the accretion disk and external Compton processes. We compile the broadband SEDs observed with Fermi/LAT and other instruments from literature for 24 TeV BL Lac objects. Two SEDs, which are identified as a low or high state according to its flux density at 1 TeV, are available for each of ten objects. These SEDs can be explained well with the synchrotron+synchrotron-self-Compton model. We constrain the magnetic filed strength B and the Doppler factor <b>delta</b> of the <b>radiation</b> region by incorporating the chi^{ 2 }-minimization technique and the gamma-ray transparency condition. Twenty-four out of the 34 SEDs can constrain B and delta in 1 sigma significance level and others only present the limits for both B and delta. The typical values of $B$ and delta are 0. 1 ~ 0. 6 G and 10 ~ 35, respectively. The derived values of gamma_b are significantly different among sources and even among the low and high states of a given source. Prominent flux variations with a clear spectral shift are observed and a tentative correlation between {{the ratio of the}} flux density at 1 TeV and the ratio of gamma_b in the low and high states is presented, likely indicating that the relativistic shocks for the electron acceleration may be responsible for the flux variations and the spectral shift. A weak anti-correlation between the jet power and the mass of the central black hole is observed, i. e., P_{jet} propto M^{- 1 }_{BH}, which disfavors the scenario of a pure accretion-driven jet. Implications for the blazar sequence and the intergalactic magnetic field from our results are also briefly discussed.

40|$|Recent updates to the {{observational}} determinations of the primordial abundances of helium and deuterium are {{compared to the}} predictions of BBN to infer the universal ratio of baryons to photons (or, the present Universe baryon mass density parameter Omega_B h^ 2), {{as well as to}} constrain the effective number of neutrinos (N_eff) and the number of equivalent neutrinos (Delta N_nu). These BBN results are compared to those derived independently from the Planck CMB data. In the absence of a light WIMP (chi), N_eff = 3. 05 (1 + Delta N_nu/ 3). In this case, there is excellent agreement between BBN and the CMB, but the joint fit finds that Delta N_nu = 0. 40 +/- 0. 17, disfavoring standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN: Delta N_nu = 0) at 2. 4 sigma, as well as a sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1) at 3. 5 sigma. In the presence of a light WIMP, the relation between N_eff and Delta N_nu depends on the WIMP mass, leading to degeneracies among N_eff, Delta N_nu, and m_chi. The complementary and independent BBN and CMB data can break some of these degeneracies. Depending {{on the nature of the}} light WIMP (Majorana or Dirac fermion, real or complex scalar) the joint BBN + CMB analyses set a lower bound to m_chi in the range from 0. 5 to 5 MeV, and they identify best fit values for m_chi in the range from 5 to 10 MeV. The joint BBN + CMB analyses find a best fit value for the number of equivalent neutrinos, Delta N_nu = 0. 65, nearly independent of the nature of the WIMP. The best fit still disfavors the absence of dark <b>radiation</b> (<b>Delta</b> N_nu = 0 at 95 % confidence), while allowing for the presence of a sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1 at less than 1 sigma).
