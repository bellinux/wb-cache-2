25|$|Injuries to his knee, {{and later}} his arm, {{drastically}} limited Fidrych's appearances in 1977–78, as the Tigers returned to <b>doormat</b> status. Perhaps more important, however, was the talent coming {{up through the}} Tigers farm system at the time. Key players like Jack Morris, Dan Petry, Alan Trammell, Lou Whitaker, Kirk Gibson and Lance Parrish all made their debuts in the late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|After {{many years}} of being a {{perennial}} <b>doormat,</b> the 2000 Huskers became the first team in school history {{to advance to the}} Super Regionals in the NCAA tournament but fell one game shy of the College World Series. Dan Johnson, Justin Cowan, Matt Hopper, and Shane Komine earned First Team Big 12 Honors. Also, Shane Komine became the Big 12 Player of the Year, Dan Johnson became the newcomer player of the year, and Matt Hopper became the freshman player of the year.|$|E
25|$|In one of {{the early}} matches on tour, Campese was on the left wing for Australia against the England B team, in a match played at Sale, south-West of Manchester. In the early stages, Dean Ryan, the giant no.8, came tearing around the fringes about 50 metres out, made a bee-line for Campese and in company with several large mates, drove hard at Campese, no doubt hoping to wipe out the Australian and leave him flat as a <b>doormat,</b> the perfect target for the {{following}} ruckers. The crowd cheered in delight as Ryan lowered his shoulder and hit Campese. The other forwards piled in.|$|E

25|$|In the Rhineland, May 1 is also {{celebrated by}} the {{delivery}} of a maypole, a tree covered in streamers {{to the house of}} a girl the night before. The tree is typically from a love interest, though a tree wrapped only in white streamers is a sign of dislike. Women usually place roses or rice {{in the form of a}} heart at the house of their beloved one. It is common to stick the heart to a window or place it in front of the <b>doormat.</b> In leap years, it is the responsibility of the women to place the maypole. All the action is usually done secretly and it is an individual's choice whether to give a hint of their identity or stay anonymous.|$|E
500|$|Overjoyed with victory, Falcons players also wept {{after the}} game, {{and the team}} ripped open pillows and threw {{feathers}} in celebration on their charter flight back to Atlanta. Buchanan stated that the win [...] "feels like a miracle" [...] due to the negative perception of the Falcons in years past. [...] "This team was dirt. People stepped on us and wiped their feet on the <b>doormat.</b> Now we feel {{like a bunch of}} Michael Jordans." [...] Chandler joked that due to his game-winning field goal, Morten Andersen [...] "gets to keep his green card," [...] referring to Andersen's Danish nationality, while running back Jamal Anderson felt vindicated for the media's continuous focus on the Vikings {{in the days leading up}} to the game, which made him feel disrespected.|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga and anime have {{commented on}} Sena's character. Ain't It Cool News' Scott Green qualified Sena as [...] "a rather likable put upon hero and visually interesting lead". Carlo Santos of Anime News Network (ANN) noted Sena fell into [...] "the archetypal shōnen protagonist" [...] and [...] "the underdog who falls and gets up {{over and over}} again" [...] mold, but praised Sena, calling him [...] "the polar opposite of those talkative, obnoxious, up-and-at-'em heroes that populate so many other series". Writing for Mania.com, Jarred Pine also called Sena an archetypical character, but noted him as a [...] "very likeable" [...] character. Pine praised his debut, saying that it [...] "was a memorable one, as it was both intense and hilarious". Later, he stated that a lead you can cheer for is essential to a sports manga, commenting that Sena [...] "fills that role quite well." [...] The contrast with [...] "Sena's hard effort and Hiruma's trickery and devilish nature" [...] was also praised by Pine. His <b>doormat</b> characteristics was initially [...] "worrying" [...] according to Manga Life's Kevin Hill who said he became [...] "far more likeable" [...] once he meets up Hiruma and Kurita. Zac Bertschy of ANN said that Sena, [...] "unlike so many other shōnen sports heroes, stops moping around and doubting himself and generally tries his damndest"; he is [...] "introspective, kind, and resourceful, something most shōnen heroes can't claim by the third volume of their respective series". Chris Homer of The Fandom Post also shared the feeling that Sena is a [...] "typical protagonist", but remarked how he develops into a more confident character, which [...] "is key to the series" [...] and makes him [...] "a more than acceptable protagonist".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} between the wars, feminists fought {{discrimination}} and establishment opposition. In Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, Woolf describes {{the extent of the}} backlash and her frustration at the waste of so much talent. By now, the word [...] "feminism" [...] was in use, but with a negative connotation from mass media, which discouraged women from self-identifying as such. In 1938, Woolf wrote of the term in Three Guineas, [...] "an old word ... that has much harm in its day and is now obsolete". When Rebecca West, another prominent writer, had been attacked as [...] "a feminist", Woolf defended her. West has been remembered for her comment [...] "I myself {{have never been able to}} find out precisely what feminism is: I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a <b>doormat,</b> or a prostitute." [...] Woolf's writing also examined gender constructs and portrayed lesbian sexuality positively.|$|E
2500|$|The {{university}} {{looked at}} many candidates to replace Blake. Many big-time college coaches were {{considered for the}} post. However, Oklahoma athletic director Joe Castiglione decided to hire a 38-year-old defensive coordinator from Florida, Bob Stoops. Stoops quickly began to build his new program with the promise to help the program regain its former position as a perennial college football powerhouse. On his arrival to campus he would find that for all his predecessor's failings as a head football coach, John Blake had been an excellent recruiter {{and many of his}} players were potential stars. Despite the obvious talent already on-campus, no quarterback suitable for the [...] "spread" [...] offense was on the team roster. Stoops would remedy this by signing a little-known junior college quarterback, Josh Heupel, to run his offense. In his first year as head coach, the Sooners showed marked improvement; starting the season with three wins over non-conference opponents amassing 132points to their opponents' 31. They lost the next two games, which included a 34-30 loss against Notre Dame at South Bend and finished the season with an overall record of 7–5. After the season, offensive coordinator Mike Leach left OU to take the head coaching position at Texas Tech. This success was {{a breath of fresh air}} for a program that had fallen from perennial powerhouse to league <b>doormat</b> and those surrounding the Sooner football program expected great things from their new head coach. They would not be disappointed.|$|E

60|$|Dr Orion Hood {{paused for}} one instant on the <b>doormat</b> and drank {{in the whole}} scene of voiceless violence.

It was so much too large for him that it almost slipped down on to his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|They {{left the}} field marvelling. For some unaccountable reason, Dencroft's had flatly refused {{to act in}} the good old way as a <b>doormat</b> for their opponents. Instead, they had played with a dash and {{knowledge}} of the game which for the first quarter of an hour quite unnerved Blair's. In that quarter of an hour they scored three times, and finished the game with two goals and three tries to their name.|$|E
60|$|Instead of {{its being}} a month {{as had been}} arranged, it was over six weeks before I was {{deposited}} again with my elegant dressing-case--a mere flying visitor--on Mrs Bowater's doorstep. A waft of cooked air floated out into the June sunshine through the letter-box. Then, in the open door, just as of old, flushed and hot in her black clothes, there stood my old friend, indescribably the same, indescribably different. She knelt down on her own <b>doormat,</b> and we exchanged loving greetings. Once more I trod beneath the wreathing, guardian horns, circumnavigated the age-stained eight-day clock, and so into my parlour.|$|E

60|$|At {{each side}} of the {{entrance}} lay a fish such as they had never seen before. It was flat as a <b>doormat</b> and seemed to cling fast to the coral floor. Upon its back were quills like those of a porcupine, all pointed and sharp. From the center of the fish arose a head shaped like a round ball, with a circle of piercing, bead-like eyes set in it. These strange guardians of the entrance might be able to tell what their numerous eyes saw, yet they remained silent and watchful. Even Aquareine gazed upon them curiously, and she gave a little shudder as she did so.|$|E
