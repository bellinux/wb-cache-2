[...] A majority of Inside Man was scanned on a Northlight <b>film</b> <b>scanner,</b> while the interrogation scenes had to be scanned on a Spirit DataCine, as the negatives proved [...] "too dense for the Northlight to perform the task." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Film</b> <b>scanners</b> {{can accept}} either strips of 35 mm or 120 film, or {{individual}} slides. Low-end scanners typically only take 35mm film strips, while medium- and high-end <b>film</b> <b>scanners</b> often have interchangeable film loaders. This allows the one scanning platform {{to be used}} for different sizes and packaging. For example, some allow microscope slides to be loaded for scanning, while mechanised slide loaders allow many individual slides to be batch scanned unattended.|$|R

50|$|Infrared {{cleaning}} is {{a technique}} used by some motion picture <b>film</b> <b>scanners,</b> <b>film</b> <b>scanners</b> and flatbed scanners to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished scan. It works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels (red, green, and blue). The infrared channel, {{in combination with the}} other channels, is used to detect the location of scratches and dust. Once located, those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by inpainting.|$|R

50|$|Prior {{to recent}} {{advances}} in virtual microscopy, slides were commonly digitized by various forms of <b>film</b> <b>scanner</b> and image resolutions rarely exceeded 5000 dpi. Nowadays, {{it is possible to}} achieve more than 100,000 dpi and thus resolutions approaching that visible under the optical microscope. This increase in scanning resolution comes at a price; whereas a typical flatbed or <b>film</b> <b>scanner</b> ranges in cost from $200 to $600, a 100,000 dpi slide scanner will range from $80,000 to $200,000.|$|E

40|$|Digital <b>film</b> <b>scanners</b> {{have been}} used in the {{photographic}} industry for more than a decade. The existence of digital image data has made possible the use of computer-based scene enhancement algorithms to improve image quality. These algorithms are usually device-dependent, functioning properly only for data generated by one scanner system. The complexity of most enhancement algorithms make them costly to develop, thus device-independent scene enhancement algorithms would be valuable. The computation of mathematical transformations to convert scanner data to a device-independent space is possible. The data created using these transformations should serve as the input for device-independent enhancement algorithms. A study to determine scanner data space transformations was performed. This study evaluated a subset of Operational Characteristics for three <b>film</b> <b>scanners.</b> These scanner characteristics were used to determine transformations to convert between scanner data spaces. These results were used as part of a system prototype to test the performance of scanner data space transformations...|$|R
