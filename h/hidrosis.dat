5000|$|The words {{diaphoresis}} and <b>hidrosis</b> {{both can}} mean either perspiration (in which sense they are synonymous with sweating) or excessive perspiration (in which sense {{they can be}} either synonymous with hyperhidrosis or differentiable from it only by clinical criteria involved in narrow specialist senses of the words).|$|E
50|$|<b>Hidrosis</b> is {{the process}} of {{activating}} the sweat glands via M3 receptors. Hyperhidrosis is a disorder marked by excessive sweating. It usually begins at puberty and affects the palms, soles, and armpits. Sweating is the body's way of cooling itself and is a normal response to a hot environment or intense exercise.|$|E
40|$|Palmoplantar <b>hidrosis</b> {{is common}} in {{patients}} who are susceptible to strains on the autonomic nervous system, and stress and mental strain have been proven to produce sweating in this population. Shigyaku-san (Sini san, TJ- 35 : Tsumura & Co.) is effective for relieving stagnation of ‘liver Qi and vital energy’ in traditional Chinese medicine theory; this brings about improvement of palmoplantar <b>hidrosis.</b> The effect of Shigyaku-san on 40 patients was evaluated based on changes in palmoplantar sweat volume and skin temperature before and after stress loading. We also measured changes in the palmoplantar sweat volume and skin temperature due to stress load in 35 healthy controls who did not receive Shigyaku-san. Before treatment, the pre-stress sweat volume in patients was larger than that in healthy controls, however, after Shigyaku-san treatment, their pre-stress sweat volume decreased. With stress, the sweat volume increased in both patients and controls, but the net increase in the patients was larger than that in healthy controls. After Shigyaku-san treatment, the net increase of sweat volume due to stress was smaller than that of pretreatment, however, it did not show a significant difference with that of healthy controls. The palmoplantar skin temperature of the patients before treatment was {{lower than that of}} healthy controls. Palmoplantar skin temperature rose with stress loading in healthy controls, but decreased in pretreatment patients. Shigyaku-san treatment reduced the palmoplantar perspiration in palmoplantar <b>hidrosis</b> patients at rest and under stress. Furthermore, it also improved other serious complications, especially coldness of the extremities...|$|E
40|$|Background: Primary focal hyperhidrosis can {{significantly}} reduce quality of life. Therefore {{a lot of}} treatment options {{in a range of}} conservative, physical and surgical techniques are available. Objective: To assess the efficacy of an antiper spirant containing aluminum chloride compared to a Botulinumtoxin A treatment for patients with primary focal hyper <b>hidrosis.</b> Methods and material: In this randomized, single-center, half-side trail, a clinical score w as done by patients and physician to evaluate the severity of hyperhidrosis. Gravimetric tests were performed to gather the amount of sweat per unit of time. Furthermore the efficacy was determined using a four point questionnaire. Skin irritation was assessed by measuring pH value and transepidermal water loss. Results: A total of 22 patients were enrolled. Two weeks after baseline the hyperhidrosis level was significantly reduced (BTX-A: ﹣ 92. 9 %, AL: 66. 7 %). In addition both treatment options induced a significant reduc tion of sweat production (BTX-A: ﹣ 80. 8 %, AL: 68. 8 %). Please change in: Patients evaluated good resp, very good efficacy for both treatment options at day 28. pH value and TEWL never left physio logical range. Conclusion: Both botulinum toxin A treatment and an antiperspirant containing aluminum chloride in the evaluated galenic formulation are an effective and safe treatment option for axillary focal hyperhidrosis. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{features}} or {{mechanisms of}} dyshidrosis {{have not been}} sufficiently clarified. Neither has the difference between hyperhidrosis and hypohidrosis. To clarify the features and mechanisms of dyshidrosis (hyperhidrosis and hypohidrosis) in syringomyelia, the clinical features focusing on <b>hidrosis</b> of 30 patients with syringomyelia and Chiari malformation located from a syringomyelia database were prospectively analysed. The patients were classified into three groups: eight patients (26. 7 %) had segmental hypohidrosis, 10 (33. 3 %) had segmental hyperhidrosis, and 12 (40. 0 %) had normohidrosis. We found that the Karnofsky functional status for the hyperhydrosis and normohidrosis groups {{were significantly higher than}} for the hypohidrosis group (p= 0. 0012), with {{no significant differences between the}} hyperhidrosis and normohidrosis groups. The duration from the onset of syringomyelia to the current dyshidrosis was significantly longer in the hypohidrosis group than in the hyperhidrosis group (p= 0. 0027). A significant correlation was identified between the duration from the onset of syringomyelia to the time at study and the performance score (r=− 0. 599, p= 0. 0003). The results substantiate previous hypotheses that in its early stage syringomyelia causes segmental hyperactivity of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons, and hyperactivity of these gradually subsides as tissue damage progresses. Focal hyperhidrosis may be regarded as a hallmark of a relatively intact spinal cord, as well as normohidrosis. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{ingrown toenail}} is an {{inflammatory}} process occurring {{as a result}} of ingrowing medial or lateral edge of the nail into the nail bed. There are various causes of this ailment. The most common are: wearing poorly fit footwear causing pressure on the nail bed from the outside, improper trimming of toenails, hereditary susceptibility, trauma, <b>hidrosis,</b> presence of a background systemic disease (e. g. obesity, diabetes), onychomycosis and some medicines (applied in psoriasis and protease inhibitors). The treatment depends on the progression of the ailment (preservative or surgical methods). The clinical analysis involved 156 patients suffering from an ingrown toenail and treated from the year 2000 until September 2005 in The Clinic of Thoracic Surgery, General Surgery and Oncology of Clinical University Hospital No. 2. The group included 115 males (74 % of patients) and 41 females (26 % of patients). The age of patients differed from 25 to 68 years (on average 43 years). We performed 174 operations of marginal resection of the nail and phenolisation of the matrix among 156 patients. 7 patients underwent the procedure on both sides and 4 patients in two toenails. The healing time of the postoperative wounds was 14 - 18 days. The recurrence of the ailment was found in 4 patients (2. 5 % of patients). There were no complications such as excessive bleeding or postoperative infection in the study group. The marginal resection of the nail connected with phenolisation of the matrix is a good method of treatment of an ingrown toenail as it causes few recurrences and complications...|$|E
