5|$|Oddfellows was {{released}} on January 29, 2013 through Ipecac Recordings, the label owned by Patton. The album had been completed for several months by this point, but its release date was moved back as the band's members <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to promote an earlier release. To support the album's release, the band played at the Voodoo Experience music festival in New Orleans, Louisiana in October 2012; and the Austin, Texas Fun Fun Fun Fest, along with several tour dates in the United States in October and November.|$|E

She joined the 7th Fleet in the region, making a goodwill visit to South Korea and entertaining South Korean president Syngman Rhee and his wife Franziska Donner. {{and at the end}} of the tour returned to San Diego on 25 June 1950, the same day as the outbreak of the Korean War. At the time, she was overdue for a maintenance overhaul, but she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to complete it before being dispatched again.|$|E

5|$|Ship's {{regulations}} {{were designed to}} keep third class passengers confined to their area of the ship. The Titanic was fitted with grilles to prevent the classes from mingling and these gates were normally kept closed, although the stewards could open them {{in the event of}} an emergency. In the rush following the collision, the stewards, occupied with waking up sleeping passengers and leading groups of women and children to the boat deck, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to open all the gates, leaving many of the confused third class passengers stuck below decks.|$|E
5|$|Two {{of the new}} {{characters}} {{introduced in}} the episode, a 19th-century crimefighter Silurian named Madame Vastra and her assistant Jenny have proven quite popular among fans, with numerous forums and SFX calling for the BBC to commission a spin-off series. Steven Moffat stated {{in an interview that}} he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to work on a spin-off but was open to the possibility of the characters returning. Vastra and Jenny, as well as a revived Strax, were made a recurring part of the seventh series.|$|E
5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E

5|$|In 1760, Pombal {{arranged}} for Dom Pedro {{to marry the}} king's unstable daughter Maria, the heiress to the throne. Pombal encouraged the couple {{to live with their}} children in the unfinished palace at Queluz, away from the seat of government. It had always been a favourite retreat of the couple and was their principal home before Maria's accession. Further enlargements were made to reflect the palace's elevation from country retreat to royal palace. However, Maria had dismissed Pombal on her accession and, as a ruling monarch, she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to while away her hours in the country. Dom Pedro interfered little in affairs of state, preferring to spend his time on religious matters.|$|E
5|$|One of Tolkien's least-known short {{works is}} the children's storybook Mr. Bliss, {{published}} in 1982. It {{tells the story}} of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of The Hobbit. The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.|$|E
5|$|Owens <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to {{complete}} the shot before the Cannes screenings, but afterwards he used cineSync to conduct {{most of the work}} from home. The shot includes two blocks of computer-generated buildings that recede into the distance of a downtown set extension. As Collins disappears into the crowd about a minute into the shot, the live footage is gradually joined with more digital work. The streetcars, tracks and power lines were all computer generated. Live-action extras appear for the first minute of the shot before being replaced by digital ones. The shot was made more complicated by the need to add Massive extras. Owens constructed the scene by first building the digital foreground around the live action footage. He then added the background before filling the scene with vehicles and people.|$|E

5|$|Paratroops from 101st Airborne {{were dropped}} {{beginning}} around 01:30, tasked with controlling the causeways behind Utah Beach and destroying road and rail bridges over the Douve River. The C-47s could not fly {{in a tight}} formation because of thick cloud cover, and many paratroopers were dropped far from their intended landing zones. Many planes came in so low that they were under fire from both flak and machine gun fire. Some paratroopers were killed on impact when their parachutes <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to open, and others drowned in the flooded fields. Gathering together into fighting units was made difficult by a shortage of radios and by the bocage terrain, with its hedgerows, stone walls, and marshes. Some units did not arrive at their targets until afternoon, by which time several of the causeways had already been cleared {{by members of the}} 4th Infantry Division moving up from the beach.|$|E
5|$|Sayers was {{recruited}} by several major Midwestern colleges {{before deciding to}} play college football at the University of Kansas. While being interviewed during a broadcast of a Chicago Cubs game on September 8, 2010, Sayers said he had originally intended {{to go to the}} University of Iowa. Sayers said that he decided against going to Iowa after the Iowa head coach, Jerry Burns, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to meet Sayers during his one campus visit. During his Jayhawks career, he rushed for 2,675 yards and gained a Big Eight Conference-record 4,020 all-purpose yards.

5|$|The lengthy German defence {{prevented}} a swift Soviet breakthrough into Estonia {{and gave the}} underground National Committee of the Republic of Estonia enough time to attempt to re-establish Estonian independence. On 1 August 1944, the national committee pronounced itself Estonia's highest authority and on 18 September 1944, acting head of state Uluots appointed a new government led by Otto Tief. Over the radio in English, the government declared its neutrality in the war. The government issued two editions of the Riigi Teataja (State Gazette) but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to distribute them. On 21 September, the national forces seized the government buildings in Toompea, Tallinn and ordered the German forces to leave. The flag of Estonia was hoisted at the tower of Pikk Hermann, to be removed by the Soviets four days later. The Estonian Government in Exile served to carry {{the continuity of the}} Estonian state forward until 1992, when it handed its credentials over to the incoming President, Lennart Meri.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} {{purchased}} by Paramount Pictures, where producer Scott Rudin hired John Boorman to direct the film. Boorman took part in location scouting, and filming was set to begin {{during the first week}} of January 1998. When a second investor left the project, Paramount refused to fully finance the $17 million production itself. Although Boorman was able to secure financing, the studio feared that filming would not be finished before the end of winter. Boorman ran into scheduling conflicts, which resulted in him leaving the production. Paramount then hired Sam Raimi to direct the film. Raimi saw A Simple Plan as an opportunity to direct a character-driven story that differed from his earlier works, which were highly stylized or dependent on intricate camera movements. Raimi <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to scout locations due to studio constraints; he relied on the previous locations visited during Boorman's involvement.|$|E
5|$|Their first-ever {{appearance}} at Wembley Stadium saw the Eagles facing Alex Ferguson's Manchester United. Gary O'Reilly opened the scoring and Ian Wright then equalised immediately after coming onto the pitch {{as a substitute}} to take the tie to extra time, before scoring again early in the extra period. Mark Hughes scored a third for United to leave the game drawn 3â€“3 and requiring a replay. In the replay the Eagles wore a new one-off yellow and black striped shirt because the club <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to find their away strip. The replay saw United left-back Lee Martin cap a 40-yard run by slotting past Martyn to win the Cup for the Red Devils.|$|E
5|$|Wanting to make maximum {{use of the}} government's {{financial}} backing, {{which was}} only available for a limited period, Pick <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to press the Underground's case for these extensions. Instead he developed a plan for {{an extension of the}} C south-west from Clapham Common to Sutton in Surrey. Pick still faced strong opposition from the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and the London and South Western Railway which operated in the area, but the Underground had the advantage of already having an approval for the last few miles of the route as part of an unused pre-war permission for a new line from Wimbledon to Sutton. The railway companies challenged the need for a new service, claiming it would simply drain passengers from their own trains and that any extension should only run as far as Tooting, but Pick was able to counter their arguments and negotiated a compromise settlement to extend the C as far as Morden.|$|E

5|$|At around 11:00 pm on 1 May, Bormann {{left the}} FÃ¼hrerbunker with SS doctor Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler Youth leader Artur Axmann, and Hitler's pilot Hans Baur {{as members of}} one of the groups {{attempting}} {{to break out of the}} Soviet encirclement. Bormann carried with him a copy of Hitler's last will and testament. The group left the FÃ¼hrerbunker and travelled on foot via a U-Bahn tunnel to the FriedrichstraÃŸe station, where they surfaced. Several members of the party attempted to cross the Spree River at the Weidendammer Bridge while crouching behind a Tiger tank. The tank was hit by Soviet artillery and destroyed, and Bormann and Stumpfegger were knocked to the ground. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and several others eventually crossed the river on their third attempt. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and Axmann walked along the railway tracks to Lehrter station, where Axmann decided to leave the others and go in the opposite direction. When he encountered a Red Army patrol, Axmann doubled back. He saw two bodies, which he later identified as Bormann and Stumpfegger, on a bridge near the railway switching yard. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to check thoroughly, so he did not know how they died. Since the Soviets never admitted to finding Bormann's body, his fate remained in doubt for many years.|$|E
5|$|The Assistant Official Assignee, James Walter Davy Ambrose (later a High Court Judge), advised Choor Singh {{to study}} law. Singh read law books in his leisure time and began saving money to study law in England. This {{proved to be}} unnecessary; {{following}} {{a change in the}} rules, he was able to enrol as an external student at the University of London and passed the matriculation examination and, in 1948, the intermediate LL.B. examination. However, he could not be called to the Bar as a barrister as he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to keep the required dining terms. On 20 May 1948, he was appointed a coroner. In December 1949, Singh was elevated to the post of magistrate, becoming the first Indian to hold such a position in colonial Malaya. He continued his law studies at Gray's Inn, and in 1953 was granted leave on a government scholarship to dine at Gray's Inn. After making four trips in two years, he became a Barrister-at-Law in 1955. In 1958, he was appointed a member of the Appeal Tribunal under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance.|$|E

Lois goes to comfort Tom's co-anchor, Diane Simmons, only to {{intuitively}} realize she is the true murderer when Diane shows a dress for her solo debut on the news, even though she couldn't have known Tom would be leaving. Diane reveals that she had dated Woods until he dumped her upon her fortieth birthday, around which Tom arranged her to be replaced on the Channel 5 News. Seeking revenge, Diane bribed Priscilla to make James become a born-again Christian and throw the dinner party so she could murder Woods and frame Tom for the crime, but was forced to kill the other guests after her plan went awry upon Stephanie's accidental death. Priscilla woke up when she was removing the knife due to Joe pointing out her fingerprints were on it, so had her throat slit. When Diane was hiding the body in Tom's room, Muriel saw her so was stabbed. The murderess <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> to conceal the knife, but was able to wipe her fingerprints clean. She killed Derek to stop the police getting involved. Diane then attempts to silence Lois by forcing her outside to a nearby cliff, only to be be shot down herself with a suppressed sniper rifle fired by Stewie, who proclaims if anyone were to kill Lois, he would be the one to do it.|$|E
