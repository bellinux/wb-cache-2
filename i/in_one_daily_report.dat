500|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation for}} the birthday-number effect {{that had to be}} tested is mere exposure. If it were true that the numbers <b>in</b> <b>one's</b> birthday are used disproportionately <b>in</b> <b>one's</b> <b>daily</b> life, then the preference for numbers <b>in</b> <b>one's</b> birthday could simply be a preference for what is most frequent. Zajonc found in his 1960s and 1980s lab studies that familiarity can strongly influence preference, and coined the term [...] "mere exposure effect". But Kitayama and Karasawa argued that even if people did see numbers from their own birthday more, this would still be negligible in comparison to the overall quantity of numbers they encounter in daily life. This is in line with the argument other researchers have used to rule out mere exposure as an {{explanation for the}} name-letter effect.|$|R
