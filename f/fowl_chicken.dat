5000|$|British celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has {{championed the}} ten-bird roast, calling it [...] "one {{of the most}} {{spectacular}} and delicious roasts you can lay before your loved ones at Yuletide". A large turkey is stuffed with a goose, duck, mallard, guinea <b>fowl,</b> <b>chicken,</b> pheasant, partridge, pigeon, and woodcock. The roast feeds approximately 30 people and, as well as the ten birds, includes stuffing made from two pounds of sausage meat and half a pound of streaky bacon, along with sage, and port and red wine.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Studies were {{conducted}} to establish the differences in yolk cholesterol concentra-tions in eggs from various avian species. Cholesterol was determined by a modification of the colorimetric procedure of Pearson et al. (1953). Species listed in increasing concentrations of cholesterol per gram of yolk, were guinea <b>fowl,</b> <b>chicken,</b> pheasant, quail, turkey, duck, goose, and dove with an overall range of 12. 77 to 21. 99 mg of cholesterol per gram of yolk. Significant differences in cholesterol concentrations also were found between domestic and wild genetic groups for turkeys and ducks. In a second study, eggs from 7 inbred lines of chickens showed significant differences in yolk cholesterol. The same general result was found {{in an analysis of}} eggs from 17 commercial test strains of chickens at two different ages. Yolk cholesterol tended to decrease as age of hen increased. These results confirm the possibility of genetically selecting for decreased yolk cholesterol if economic or other conditions warrant. The increased efforts required to decrease yolk cholesterol by this approach would undoubtedly be expensive...|$|E

5000|$|Based on his {{analysis}} of a Mohenjo-daro seal, Iravatham Mahadevan speculates that the city's ancient name could have been Kukkutarma ("the city -rma of the cockerel kukkuta"). However, {{according to a recent}} study, [...] "it is not known whether these birds made much contribution to the modern domestic <b>fowl.</b> <b>Chickens</b> from the Harappan culture of the Indus Valley (2500-2100 BC) may have been the main source of diffusion throughout the world."

40|$|Differential {{expression}} of IL- 6 and IGF-II genes were studied in guinea <b>fowl</b> and broiler <b>chicken</b> using semi-quantitative analysis. A 219 bp fragment of IL- 6 and 215 bp fragment of IGF-II were amplified in guinea <b>fowl</b> and broiler <b>chicken</b> using chicken specific primers. Semi-quantitative analysis revealed the adjusted Integral Density of 0. 853 and 0. 051 for IL- 6 band in guinea <b>fowl</b> and broiler <b>chicken</b> respectively, revealing 16. 62 fold higher IL- 6 mRNA expression in LPS induced PBMCs from guinea fowl {{as compared to}} that from broiler. However, adjusted Integral Density of IGF-II band was 0. 082 and 1. 106 for IGF-II band in guinea <b>fowl</b> and broiler <b>chicken</b> respectively, which revealed 13. 43 fold increase in IGF-II mRNA expression in LPS induced PBMCs in broiler chicken as compared to that in guinea fowl. Hence, guinea fowl showed higher {{expression of}} pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL- 6) and lower expression of IGF-II in comparison to broiler chicken.

40|$|Numerous {{reports have}} now {{described}} the structural {{relationships between the}} immunoglobulins of various lower and higher vertebrates (see reference 1). However, an important void in our knowledge of lower vertebrate antibodies is that of valences and association constants. Since quantitative data of this type can only be readily obtained by using haptens and specifically purified antibodies, studies on the antibody responses of various species of lower vertebrates have been initiated. Elasmobranchii (sharks), fish (both holosteans and teleosteans), amphibians (marine toads), reptiles (alligators), and <b>fowl</b> (<b>chickens)</b> can make antibody to the 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl (DNP) 1 determinant (2). Teleosts in general appeared to synthesize higher levels of antibody to this determinant than did the other taxonomic groups. Thus we have chosen to focus initially on teleost antibodies to DNP. For these studies the giant grouper, Epinephelus itaira, was chosen; {{the use of this}} species instead of many of the smaller teleosts circumvents the need for using pooled sera. This report describes the isolation of grouper antibodies to DNP and the determinations of their valences and average intrinsic association constants. The physicochemica...|$|R
40|$|Measurement of {{the rate}} of {{elimination}} of 51 Cr-labelled erythrocytes provides a reliable test of immunity in <b>fowls.</b> <b>Chickens</b> can be rendered tolerant of homologous and turkey erythrocytes, as judged by this test, by receiving a series of transfusions of irradiated blood. The series were arranged so that foreign cells remained present in the circulation {{from the time of}} hatching. Tolerance induced by this treatment is generally incomplete, but can last indefinitely. In some chickens the manifestation of tolerance of turkey erythrocytes is delayed, probably because of passive transmission of antibody from the dam. Chickens old enough to react against small transfusions of homologous blood can still be rendered tolerant by massive transfusions. Tolerance of the erythrocytes from an individual donor extends only slightly to those from other donors. Tolerance acquired in this way, through transfusion of irradiated blood, stands in contrast to the more stable and complete tolerance that can be acquired through administration of viable cells. Viable cells, on the other hand, provide a less sensitive test, for birds which tolerate skin homografts often eliminate rapidly erythrocytes from the same donor...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} altered weight upon animal {{tolerance}} to restraint {{was determined by}} simulating various accelerative forces with directed lead weights using restrained and nonrestrained domestic <b>fowl</b> (<b>chickens).</b> Weighting (increased weight) and conterweighting (reduced weight) produced a stressed condition - reduced relative lymphocyte counts, loss of body mass, and/or {{the development of a}} disorientation syndrome - in both restrained and nonrestrained (caged only) birds. The animal's tolerance to altered weight appeared to be a function of its body weight. Unrestrained birds were stressed by counterweighting (mean plus or minus standard error) 58. 3 plus or minus 41 % of their body weight, whereas restrained birds tolerated only 32. 2 plus or minus 2. 6 % reduction in body weight. A training regimen for restrained birds was not effective in improving their tolerance to a reduced weight environment. It was concluded that domestic fowl living in a weightless (space) environment should be restrained minimally and supported by ventrally directed tension equivalent to approximately 50 % of their body mass (their weight in a 1 G environment) ...|$|R
50|$|Like other sea eagles, the African {{fish eagle}} has {{structures}} on its toes called spiricules that {{allow it to}} grasp fish and other slippery prey. The osprey, a winter visitor to Africa, also has this adaptation. Should the African fish eagle catch a fish over 1.8 kg, it is too heavy to allow the eagle to get lift, so it instead drags the fish {{across the surface of}} the water until it reaches the shore. If it catches a fish too heavy to allow the eagle to sustain flight, it will drop into the water and paddle to the nearest shore with its wings. The African fish eagle is known to peculate other bird species (such as goliath herons) of their catch in a behaviour known as kleptoparasitism. It also feeds on waterfowl such as ducks, small turtles and terrapins, baby crocodiles, greater and lesser flamingos, lizards, frogs, and carrion. Occasionally, it may even carry off mammalian prey, such as hyraxes and monkeys. It has also been observed feeding on domestic <b>fowl</b> (<b>chickens).</b>|$|R

40|$|The diseased {{condition}} of chickens {{resulting from a}} lack of vitamin A in the diet is probably the most important of the nutritional diseases caused by A-avitaminosis in domestic animals. As pointed out by Beach (1) and Seifried and Schaaf (2), it causes serious losses on poultry farms. The clinical and anatomical picture closely resembles that found {{in some of the most}} important infectious diseases of <b>fowls,</b> <b>chicken</b> pox, coryza contagiosa, and infectious bronchitis. Golblatt and Benischek (3), Tyson and Smith (4), and Wolbach and Howe (5) have described the histological changes following a lack of vitamin A in the diet in guinea pigs, rats, and in one human individual. The characteristic changes are the substitution of stratified keratinizing epithelium for normal epithelium in various parts of the respiratory tract, alimentary tract, eyes, paraocular gland s and the genitourinary tract. No studies have been made of the histological changes in A-avitaminosis in fowls. It is the purpose of this paper to report such studies and to compare the changes with those found in certain infectious diseases.

50|$|A cock egg is {{most often}} a pullet's first effort, {{produced}} before her laying mechanism is fully ready. In a mature hen, a wind egg is unlikely, but can occur if a bit of reproductive tissue breaks away, stimulating the egg-producing glands to treat it as a yolk and wrap it in albumen, membranes and a shell as it travels through the egg tube. This has occurred if, instead of a yolk, the egg contains a small particle of grayish tissue. This type of egg occurs in many varieties of <b>fowl,</b> including <b>chickens</b> (both standard and bantams), guineafowl, and Japanese (Coturnix) quail.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) semen was {{collected}} at 10 a. m., 2 p. m., or 6 p. m. for four consecutive days during four consecutive weeks. All {{but the first}} day's collections were analyzed for sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, H+ concentra-tion, cell count, volume and total sperm number. A random sample was then collected {{for the analysis of}} amylase and another random sample {{was collected}} for the analysis of glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). The activities of GOT and LDH in quail semen were approximately ten times higher than those obtained for larger <b>fowl</b> (<b>chickens</b> and turkeys) and mammals. While CPK levels have not been measured in other animals, its activity in quail semen is probably also high. There was {{a significant difference between the}} enzyme activity of the sperm and seminal plasma for GOT and CPK. The parameters of sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, H+ concentration, cell count, volume, and total sperm number did not show a significant variation at the hours of 10 a. m., 2 p. m., and 6 p. m. Three of these parameters (cell count, potassium, and chloride), however did show significant variation during collection over three consecutive days, the chloride decreasing and potassium and cell count first decreasing and then by the third day returning to levels of the first day.
