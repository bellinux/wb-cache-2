40|$|<b>Guanabenz,</b> a {{clinically}} used anti-hypertensive agent, inhibits the P 450 -like enzyme neuronal NO-synthase (nNOS) {{and enhances}} its ubiquitination and degradation. To {{better understand the}} molecular trigger for nNOS ubiquitination and degradation, we characterized the mechanism of <b>guanabenz</b> inhibition of nNOS and identified the site of ubiquitin attachment to the enzyme. Using purified nNOS and an in vitro system, we found that <b>guanabenz</b> treatment leads to the oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin by nNOS-derived superoxide. Tetrahydrobiopterin is a known cofactor for NO synthesis by nNOS, binding near the heme and stabilizing the active dimeric structure of the enzyme. Tetrahydrobiopterin was found to reverse the guanabenz-mediated inhibition of nNOS in vitro. Similarly, administration of tetrahydrobiopterin to rats prevented both nNOS inhibition and loss of enzyme after <b>guanabenz</b> treatment, indicating {{that the loss of}} tetrahydrobiopterin {{plays a major role in}} the effects of <b>guanabenz</b> in vivo. To investigate if the loss of tetrahydrobiopterin was sufficient for eliciting the enhanced turnover of nNOS, we depleted tetrahydrobiopterin in cells by inhibiting GTP cyclohydrolase I with 2, 4 -diamino- 6 -hydroxypyrimidine. A 75 % decrease in tetrahydrobiopterin levels led to a 2 -fold increase in the amount of nNOS-ubiquitin conjugates detected. Consistent with our cellular observations, in vitro ubiquitination and degradation of nNOS by reticulocyte lysate proteins was decreased when tetrahydrobiopterin was added. Thus, tetrahydrobiopterin may serve as an endogenous regulator of nNOS protein levels. Through mutagenesis studies, we were able to localize the ubiquitination site to the calmodulin binding region of nNOS (residues 720 - 756). Peptide mapping studies using capillary flow liquid chromatography interfaced with a linear ion trap mass spectrometer identified residue 754 as a site for ubiquitin attachment. Furthermore, using methylated ubiquitin and purified nNOS, we determined that mono-ubiquitination of nNOS is sufficient for proteasomal degradation in vitro. Thus, it is possible that alterations of the heme active site structure, in this case through oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin, are recognized by cellular factors that direct the ubiquitination of a lysine residue in the calmodulin binding region, resulting in the selective proteasomal degradation of nNOS...|$|E

Renal vasoconstrictor responses to renal nerve stimulation and a,-adrener-gk receptor agonists (norepinephrine, phenylephrine) were inhibited by an a,-adrenergic receptor antagonist (prazosin) {{but not by}} an aradrenergic receptor antagonist (rauwolscine). A semilog plot of renal vasoconstrictor responses as fraction of control renal blood flow versus agonist dose (in nano-grams) was linear with the slope, k, taken as the fractional decrease in renal blood flow per nanogram. The aj-adrenergic receptor agonists (clonidine, <b>guanabenz)</b> produced minimal renal vasoconstrictor responses (fractional decrease in renal blood flow per nanogram: norepinephrine, 0. 011; phenyleph-rine, 0. 003; clonidine, 0. 00087; <b>guanabenz,</b> 0. 000037). The small renal vasoconstrictor responses to clonidine and <b>guanabenz</b> were more inhibited by rauwolscine than by prazosin. Low frequency renal nerve stimulation produced antidiuresis and antinatriuresis without decreasing giomenilar filtration rate or renal blood flow. The antidiuretic and antlnatriuretic responses were inhibited by prazosin but unaffected by rauwolscine. The magnitude of the renal vascular and tubular responses and thei...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{glucose metabolism}} after I 1 -imidazoline (I 1 R) and 2 -adrenergic receptor (2 AR) activation in an animal model of metabolic syndrome X. Fasted spontaneously hypertensive obese rats (SHROB) {{were given the}} I 1 R/ 2 AR agonists mox-onidine and rilmenidine or the 2 AR agonist <b>guanabenz.</b> Be-cause of the dual specificity of moxonidine, its actions were split into adrenergic and nonadrenergic components by using selective antagonists: rauwolscine (2 AR) efaroxan (I 1 R/ 2 AR), or 2 -endo-amino- 3 -exo-isopropylbicyclo[2. 2. 1. ]heptane (AGN 192403) (I 1 R). Hyperglycemia induced by moxonidine, rilmeni-dine, and <b>guanabenz</b> resulted from inhibition of insulin secre-tion. Similar responses were observed after oral dosing and in lean littermates.

40|$|Non-adrenergic ligands {{that bind}} to {{imidazoline}} receptors (I-R), a selective ligand that binds to alpha 2 -adrenoceptors (alpha 2 -AR) and mixed ligands that bind to both receptors were tested for their action on water intake behavior of 24 -h water-deprived rats. All drugs were {{injected into the}} third cerebral ventricle. Except for agmatine (80 nmol), mixed ligands binding to I-R/alpha 2 -AR such as <b>guanabenz</b> (40 nmol) and UK 14304 (20 nmol) inhibited water intake by 65 % and up to 95 %, respectively. The selective non-imidazoline alpha 2 -AR agonist, alpha-methylnoradrenaline, produced inhibition of water intake similar to that obtained with <b>guanabenz,</b> but at higher doses (80 nmol). The non-adrenergic I-R ligands histamine (160 nmol, mixed histaminergic and imidazoline ligand) and imidazole- 4 -acetic acid (80 nmol, imidazoline ligand) did not alter water intake. The results show that selective, non-imidazoline alpha 2 -AR activation suppresses water intake, and suggest that the action on imidazoline sites by non-adrenergic ligands {{is not sufficient to}} inhibit water intake...|$|E
40|$|The alpha- 2 {{adrenergic}} receptor agonists, clonidine, lofexidine and <b>guanabenz,</b> blocked stress- but not cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking at doses that suppressed footshock-induced release of noradrenaline in prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Rats {{were trained to}} self-administer cocaine (0. 5 mg/kg/infusion, i. v; 10 - 12 days) and, after a drug-free period (7 - 13 days), were returned to the self-administration chambers for daily extinction and reinstatement test sessions. Both intermittent footshock (15 min, 0. 6 mA) and cocaine priming (20 mg/kg, i. p.) reinstated extinguished drug seeking. Pretreatment with either clonidine (20, or 40 Î¼g/kg, i. p.) or lofexidine (50, 100, 150, or 200 Î¼g/kg, i. p.) attenuated footshock- but not cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. <b>Guanabenz</b> (640 Î¼g/kg, i. p.), an alpha- 2 agonist with low affinity for imidazoline type- 1 receptors, also attenuated footshock- but not cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the effects of the {{centrally}} acting antihypertensive drugs rilmenidine, moxonidine, clonidine and <b>guanabenz</b> on sympathetic tone with their effects on noradrenaline release in the cerebral cortex. In particular, the hypothesis was tested that rilmenidine and moxonidine, due to their high affinity for sympatho-inhibitory imidazoline I 1 receptors and low affinity for α 2 -adrenoceptors, lower sympathetic tone without causing an α 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of cerebrocortical noradrenaline release. In rats anaesthetized with urethane, blood pressure and heart rate were measured and the concentration of noradrenaline in arterial blood plasma was determined. The release of noradrenaline in the medial prefrontal cortex was estimated by microdialysis. Intravenous administration of rilmenidine (30, 100, 300 and 1000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1), moxonidine (10, 30, 100 and 300 [*]μg[*]kg− 1), clonidine (1, 3, 10 and 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) and <b>guanabenz</b> (1, 3, 10 and 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) led to dose-dependent hypotension and bradycardia; the plasma noradrenaline concentration also decreased. After the two highest doses, all four drugs lowered noradrenaline release in the prefrontal cortex. At doses eliciting equal hypotensive and sympatho-inhibitory responses, rilmenidine and moxonidine inhibited cerebral cortical noradrenaline release at least as much as clonidine and <b>guanabenz.</b> The results show that rilmenidine and moxonidine lower cerebrocortical noradrenaline release at doses similar to those which cause sympatho-inhibition. This effect was probably due to an α 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of the firing of locus coeruleus neurons and, in addition, to presynaptic inhibition of noradrenaline release at the level of the axon terminals in the cortex. The results argue against the hypothesis that rilmenidine and moxonidine, due to their selectivity for sympatho-inhibitory I 1 imidazoline receptors, do not suppress noradrenergic neurons in the central nervous system...|$|E

Anabolic and anti-resorptive drugs are currently available for treatment, however, none of these drugs are able to both promote osteoblastogenesis and reduce osteoclastogenesis. This thesis focused on the role of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF 2 alpha), which regulates efficiency of translational initiation. The elevation of phosphorylated eIF 2 alpha was reported to stimulate osteoblastogenesis, but its effects on osteoclastogenesis have not been well understood. Using synthetic chemical agents such as salubrinal and <b>guanabenz</b> that are known to inhibit the de-phosphorylation of eIF 2 alpha, the role of phosphorylation of eIF 2 alpha in osteoclastogenesis was investigated in this thesis. 	 	The questions addressed herein were: Does the elevation of phosphorylated eIF 2 alpha (p-eIF 2 alpha) by salubrinal and <b>guanabenz</b> alter osteoclastogenesis? If so, what regulatory mechanism mediates the process? It was hypothesized that p-eIF 2 alpha could attenuate the development of osteoclast by regulating the transcription factor(s) amd microRNA(s) involved in osteoclastogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we conducted in vitro and in silico analysis of the responses of RAW 264. 7 pre-osteoclast cells to salubrinal and <b>guanabenz.</b> 	First, the in vitro results revealed that the elevated level of phosphorylated eIF 2 alpha inhibited the proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of RAW 264. 7 cells and downregulated the expression of NFATc 1, a master transcription factor of osteoclastogenesis. Silencing eIF 2 alpha by RNA interference suppressed the downregulation of NFATc 1, suggesting the involvement of eIF 2 alpha in regulation of NFATc 1. Second, the in silico results using genome-wide expression data and custom-made Matlab programs predicted a set of stimulatory and inhibitory regulator genes as well as microRNAs, which were potentially involved in the regulation of NFATc 1. RNA interference experiments indicated that the genes such as Zfyve 21 and Ddit 4 were primary candidates as an inhibitor of NFATc 1. 	In summary, the results showed that the elevation of p-eIF 2 alpha by salubrinal and <b>guanabenz</b> leads to attenuation of osteoclastogenesis through the downregulation of NFATc 1.
