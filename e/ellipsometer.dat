40|$|The {{main object}} of this chapter {{is to give}} an {{overview}} the possibilities offered by instruments capable of measuring full Mueller matrices {{in the field of}} optical characterization. We have chosen to call these instruments Mueller <b>ellipsometers</b> in order to highlight their close relation with instruments traditionally used in ellipsometry. We want to make clear to the reader the place that Mueller ellipsometry takes with respect to standard ellipsometry by showing the similarities but also the differences among these techniques, both in instrumentation and data treatment. To do so the chapter starts by a review of the optical formalisms used in standard and Mueller ellipsometry respectively. In order to highlight the particularities and the advantages brought by Mueller ellipsometry, a special section is devoted to the algebraic properties of Mueller matrices and to the description of different ways to decompose them. Matrix decompositions are used to unveil the basic polarimetric properties of a the sample when a precise model is not available. Then follows a description of the most common optical configurations used to build standard <b>ellipsometers.</b> Special attention is paid to show what can and what cannot be measured with them. On the basis of this knowledge it is shown the interest of measuring whole Mueller matrices, in particular for samples characterized by complex anisotropy and/or depolarization. Among the numerous optical assemblies able to measure full Mueller matrices, most of them are laboratory prototypes, and only very few have been industrialized so far. Because an extensive and comparative review of all the Mueller ellipsometric instruments developed to date is clearly out of the scope of this chapter, we limit our description to four Mueller <b>ellipsometers,</b> two imaging and two spectroscopic systems that have been developed by us in the past years. The technical description of the Mueller <b>ellipsometers</b> is accompanied by some examples of applications which, without being exhaustive, are representative of the type of analyses performed in ellipsometry, and also illustrate the advantages that can be brought by modern Mueller <b>ellipsometers</b> to optical metrology, materials science and biomedicin...|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>ellipsometers</b> {{are complex}} {{instruments}} that incorporate {{a wide variety}} of radiation sources, detectors, digital electronics and software. The range of wavelength employed is far in excess of what is visible so strictly these are no longer optical instruments.|$|R
2500|$|Ellipsometry {{can also}} be done as imaging {{ellipsometry}} by using a CCD camera as a detector. This provides a real time contrast image of the sample, which provides information about film thickness and refractive index. Advanced imaging <b>ellipsometer</b> technology operates {{on the principle of}} classical null ellipsometry and real-time ellipsometric contrast imaging. [...] Imaging ellipsometry is based on the concept of nulling. [...] In ellipsometry, the film under investigation is placed onto a reflective substrate. [...] The film and the substrate have different refractive indexes. [...] In order to obtain data about film thickness, the light reflecting off of the substrate must be nulled. [...] Nulling is achieved by adjusting the analyzer and polarizer so that all reflected light off of the substrate is extinguished. [...] Due to the difference in refractive indexes, this will allow the sample to become very bright and clearly visible. The light source consists of a monochromatic laser of the desired wavelength. A common wavelength that is used is 532nm green laser light. [...] Since only intensity of light measurements are needed, almost any type of camera can be implemented as the CCD, which is useful if building an <b>ellipsometer</b> from parts. [...] Typically, imaging ellipsometers are configured in such a way so that the laser (L) fires a beam of light which immediately passes through a linear polarizer (P). [...] The linearly polarized light then passes through a quarter wavelength compensator (C) which transforms the light into elliptically polarized light. [...] This elliptically polarized light then reflects off the sample (S), passes through the analyzer (A) and is imaged onto a CCD camera by a long working distance objective. The analyzer here is another polarizer identical to the P, however, this polarizer serves to help quantify the change in polarization and is thus given the name analyzer. [...] This design is commonly referred to as a LPCSA configuration.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{typically}} {{two different ways}} of mathematically describing how an electromagnetic wave interacts with the elements within an <b>ellipsometer</b> (including the sample): the Jones matrix and the Mueller matrix formalisms. In the Jones matrix formalism, the electromagnetic wave is described by a Jones vector with two orthogonal complex-valued entries for the electric field (typically [...] and [...] ), and the effect that an optical element (or sample) has on it is described by the complex-valued 2x2 Jones matrix. [...] In the Mueller matrix formalism, the electromagnetic wave is described by Stokes vectors with four real-valued entries, and their transformation is described by the real-valued 4x4 Mueller matrix. When no depolarization occurs both formalisms are fully consistent. Therefore, for non-depolarizing samples, the simpler Jones matrix formalism is sufficient. If the sample is depolarizing the Mueller matrix formalism should be used, because it also give the amount of depolarization. Reasons for depolarization are, for instance, thickness non-uniformity or backside-reflections from a transparent substrate.|$|E

By in situ ellipsometry measurements it is possible to determine fundamental process parameters, such as, growth or etch rates, [...] variation of optical properties with time. In situ ellipsometry measurements require a number of additional considerations: The sample spot is usually not as easily accessible as for ex situ measurements outside the process chamber. Therefore, the mechanical setup has to be adjusted, which can include additional optical elements (mirrors, prisms, or lenses) for redirecting or focusing the light beam. Because the environmental conditions during the process can be harsh, the sensitive optical elements of the ellipsometry setup must be separated from the hot zone. In the simplest case this is done by optical view ports, though strain induced birefringence of the (glass-) windows has {{to be taken into account}} or minimized.
