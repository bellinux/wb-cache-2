50|$|The {{electricity}} {{sector in}} Switzerland relies mainly on hydroelectricity, since the Alps cover {{almost two-thirds of}} the country's land mass, providing many large mountain lakes and artificial reservoirs suited for hydro power. In addition, the water masses drained from the Swiss Alps are intensively used by run-of-the-river hydroelectricity (ROR). With 9,052 <b>kWh</b> per <b>person</b> in 2008, the country's electricity consumption is relatively high and was 22% above the European Union's average.|$|R

50|$|Current annual {{electricity}} demand in Ontario is 151 TWh. In other words, on average, Ontarians consume 12,750 <b>kWh</b> per <b>person</b> per year. Based on 2003 information, {{this figure is}} approximately 25% lower than the Canadian average, roughly equal to U.S. rates, and about {{twice as high as}} European consumption levels (see: electricity consumption by country). In order to supply such demand, Ontario counts on 31,000 MW of installed power capacity, broken down as follows: 37% nuclear, 26% renewable (including hydro-electric power), 16% natural gas and 21% coal.|$|R

40|$|This {{work was}} a data {{collection}} {{of electricity and}} water supply consumption of the Dean’s Office of the Faculty of Science and Technology, Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, Thailand. The greenhouse gas emissions from electricity and water supply consumptions were calculated using the up-to-date emission factor from the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO) database. In average, the office consumes 1. 045 m 3 /d and 87. 9 kWh/d of water and electricity, respectively. This is equal to 68. 5 Liter per person (11. 25 L/m 2) and 4. 1 <b>kWh</b> per <b>person</b> (0. 6788 <b>kWh</b> /m 2) for the daily water supply and electricity consumptions, respectively.

40|$|A widely-quoted {{estimate}} of the practical UK tidal resource is 12 TWh/y [Black and Veatch, 2005]. I believe this is an underestimate, because {{it is based on}} an incorrect physical model of the flow of energy in a tidal wave. In a shallow-water-wave model of tide, the true flow of energy is greater than the Black-and-Veatch flow by a factor of 2 d/h, where d is the water depth and h is the tide’s vertical amplitude. The tidal resource may therefore have been underestimated by a factor of 10 or 20. The widely-quoted {{estimate of}} the practical UK tidal resource is 12 TWh/y (equivalent to an average production of 1. 4 GW, or 0. 5 <b>kWh</b> per <b>person</b> per day) [Black and Veatch, 2005].

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this report to seek out viable options for the Turkish {{environmental}} policy and to provide an impact analysis of possible environmental policy instruments on long run growth, employment, investments, and consumer welfare. As part of its attempts towards full membership to the European Union, Turkey is under significant pressure to recognize the conditionalities of the Kyoto Protocol to reduce its CO 2 emissions and other gaseous pollutants over the next six years. Yet, as a newly emerging —developing- market economy, Turkey has not yet achieved stability in its energy utilization and gaseous emissions either as a ratio to its GDP or at a per capita level, and it is cited among the 25 countries that display fastest rate of growth in industrial use of energy sources. TURKSTAT data indicate, for instance, that on a per capita basis, consumption of electricity power in Turkey has increased by six-folds from 1980 to 2005. Per capita consumption of electricity is expected to increase from its current level of 300 <b>Kwh</b> per <b>person</b> to 400 <b>KwH</b> per perso...|$|R
40|$|Meeting European {{renewable}} energy production targets is expected to cause significant changes in land use patterns. With an EU target of obtaining 20 % of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020, national and local policy makers need guidance {{on the impact of}} potential delivery strategies on ecosystem goods and services to ensure the targets are met in a sustainable manner. Within agroecosystems, models are available to explore consequences of such policy decisions for food, fuel and fibre production but few can describe the effect on biodiversity. This paper describes the integration and application of a farmland bird population model within a geographical information system (GIS) to explore the consequences of land use changes arising from different strategies to meet {{renewable energy}} production targets. Within a 16, 000 ha arable dominated case study area in England, the population growth rates of 19 farmland bird species were predicted under baseline land cover, a scenario maximising wheat production for bioethanol, and a scenario focused on mix of bioenergy sources. Both scenarios delivered {{renewable energy production}} targets for the region (> 12 <b>kWh</b> per <b>person</b> per day) but, despite differences in resultant landscape composition, the response of the farmland bird community as a whole to each scenario was small and broadly similar. However, this similarity in overall response masked significant intra- and inter-specific variations across the study area and between scenarios suggesting contrasting mechanisms of impact and highlighting the need for context dependent, species-level assessment of land use change impacts. This framework provides one of the first systematic attempts to spatially model the effect of policy driven land use change on the population dynamics of a suite of farmland birds. The GIS framework also facilitates its integration with other ecosystem service models to explore wider synergies and trade offs arising from national or local policy interventions...|$|R
