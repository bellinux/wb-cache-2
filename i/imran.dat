5|$|On {{the way to}} Seville, Kabir drops Natasha at the airport, while Arjun and <b>Imran</b> {{notice that}} {{something}} is wrong between them. <b>Imran</b> later reassures his friends that everything is okay. The trio visit Seville for sky diving, Arjun's choice. During the task, <b>Imran</b> is forced to confront his acrophobia and hesitates to take part. However, they complete it without any obstacles. After skydiving, the three men go to a bar and get into a fight with a stranger on whom they had tried to pull a prank. They are jailed after the fight. After Laila and Nuria do not answer their calls to bail them out, <b>Imran</b> reluntantly proceeds to call Salman Habib. Salman bails them out and takes them to his home. While speaking to <b>Imran,</b> Salman reveals that he never wanted the responsibility of a married life with kids, while Imran's mother did, which is why he never contacted <b>Imran.</b> <b>Imran,</b> heartbroken, realises how his actions must have hurt Arjun four years back. He earnestly apologises to Arjun, and Arjun, seeing the genuineness of the apology, forgives him with a hug.|$|E

5|$|The trio {{learn of}} the bull run in Pamplona, which is Imran's choice— {{baffling}} Kabir and Arjun. <b>Imran</b> calls up Laila, who comes along, surprising Arjun. When confronted by his friends, Kabir confesses {{to the other two}} that he is still not ready for a marriage, and that Natasha had gotten the wrong idea (of him proposing to her) on seeing the ring that he had bought for his mother as a birthday present. On the morning of the bull run, <b>Imran</b> suggests they make a pact to make a promise if they survive the event. <b>Imran</b> vows to publish his poetry (which he has penned down in his private diary), Arjun vows to go to Morocco with Laila, and Kabir promises to tell Natasha that {{he does not want to}} marry her. As they complete the event, the friends gain a renewed sense of their relationships with each other, with others they know, and with themselves.|$|E
5|$|They fly to Spain {{separately}} and meet in Barcelona. They decide their schedule, where {{they plan to}} visit Costa Brava, Seville, and Pamplona. On the way to Costa Brava, <b>Imran</b> and Kabir find it annoying that Arjun works even during the trip. <b>Imran</b> nonchalantly throws Arjun's mobile phone out of their car while {{he is in the}} middle of an official call. This leads to a heated argument. Arjun, in a fit of rage, accuses <b>Imran</b> of having an affair, four years prior, with Arjun's previous girlfriend Sonali (a topic which was very sensitive both to Arjun and Imraan). After being pacified by Kabir, they eventually resume their journey. Upon reaching their destination, they meet an Anglo Indian named Laila (Katrina Kaif) on a beach. <b>Imran</b> flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous. Kabir reveals that he has chosen deep sea diving as their first sport, and they later find that Laila is their diving instructor. Arjun, who cannot swim and is aquaphobic, receives assistance from Laila. She helps him overcome his fears and finish the sport successfully. Upon a request by Laila, they attend the La Tomatina festival with her in Buñol and meet Nuria (Ariadna Cabrol), who falls in love with Imraan. Meanwhile, Natasha becomes suspicious of Kabir's involvement with Laila when she sees them via webcam and crashes his bachelor party trip, much to Kabir's discomfort in front of his friends. <b>Imran</b> spends time with Nuria, and Arjun with Laila. After the boys leave, Laila realises she has fallen in love with Arjun and chases them on a bike, not wanting to regret their partition if they do not meet in future. She and Arjun express their feelings for each other with a passionate kiss.|$|E
5|$|During the credits, <b>Imran,</b> Kabir, Nuria and Natasha {{are shown}} {{attending}} {{the wedding of}} Arjun and Laila in Morocco. Natasha is seen with a new man, and Kabir and Natasha are still friends. Imran's poems are revealed throughout the story after each sporting event showing that he had published them.|$|E

5|$|The SAS team tracks down Al-Asad in Azerbaijan, and {{discover}} {{that he was}} working with <b>Imran</b> Zakhaev, the leader of the Ultranationalist party. The mission then flashes back to 1996, where Captain Price, who was a Lieutenant at the time, is sent alongside his commanding officer, Captain MacMillan, on a failed assassination attempt on <b>Imran</b> Zakhaev. After killing Al-Asad, the SAS team, with support from U.S. Force Recon and Russian loyalists, attempt to capture Zakhaev's son and learn his whereabouts. They ambush him, but he commits suicide. In response, Zakhaev seizes control of a nuclear launch facility. A joint operation is launched to take back the site, but Zakhaev launches intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S. eastern seaboard. The joint teams are able to breach the facility and remotely destroy the missiles before fleeing the area.|$|E

5|$|The film begins {{where its}} {{predecessor}} ended, with reigning don Shoaib Khan (Akshay Kumar) earning respect after assassinating his mentor, Sultan Mirza (Ajay Devgn). Twelve {{years later he}} is still a charismatic, suave womaniser, who has extended his empire to the Mideast. Khan's only friends are Javed (Sarfaraz Khan) (who oversees his illegal work), his former love Mumtaz (Sonali Bendre), and Aslam (<b>Imran</b> Khan), a teenager Khan met during a visit to the slums in which he grew up.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opens with}} Kabir (Abhay Deol) proposing to Natasha (Kalki Koechlin). Their {{families}} {{meet at the}} engagement party where Natasha learns that Kabir is planning a three-week bachelor road trip to Spain with his school friends <b>Imran</b> (Farhan Akhtar) and Arjun (Hrithik Roshan). Kabir explains that the three have a long-standing pact, and that during the road trip, each of them will have to pick an adventure sport which all three will try together. Initially, Arjun is reluctant to take trip as {{he does not want}} to lose his pay for missing work. It is later revealed that Arjun's former girlfriend left him due to his workaholism and his obsession with money. <b>Imran</b> has an additional secret agenda on the trip, to find his biological father Salman Habib (Naseeruddin Shah), an artist in Spain, about whom he learnt soon after the death of his step-father.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick's maiden {{international}} century came {{against the}} Sindh Governor's XI in October 2000, {{during the first}} warm-up match to the Pakistan series.

He took his sole Test wicket in the third Test, when Ashley Giles caught the Pakistan opener <b>Imran</b> Nazir.|$|E
5|$|Producer Ekta Kapoor {{promoted}} the film's second trailer, buying prime-time (8 to 11 pm) slots on four television channels. She also spent 20million rupees for a slot on a leading channel for a promotion for the film. Askhay Kumar, Sonakshi Sinha and <b>Imran</b> Khan (the three leads) {{promoted the}} film on Comedy Nights with Kapil, hosted by Kapil Sharma. Kumar, Sinha, Khan, Kapoor {{and most of}} the other cast and crew visited the Dargah Sharif (a shrine to the Sufi saint Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer) on Monday morning, 5 August, to pray for the film's success and the well-being of all involved.|$|E
5|$|Sussex {{also took}} part in the first round, facing Suffolk, one of the minor cricket {{counties}} who did not play first-class cricket. Suffolk were bowled out for 101 runs, a total which Sussex chased down with 161 deliveries remaining. Another minor county, Staffordshire, were Sussex's second round opponents, but the margin of victory was far narrower. Sussex batted first and scored 221 for 6, in which Paul Parker scored his second half-century of the competition. In their response, Staffordshire fell three runs short, finishing with 219 for 9; each of <b>Imran</b> Khan and Geoff Arnold collecting four wickets. In the quarter-final, Sussex faced Yorkshire. The match began on 2 August, but after 52 overs of Yorkshire's innings no further play was possible, even though the match had two reserve days. On 4 August, the match was abandoned, and replaced with a match in which each side would bat for 10 innings. In that match, Sussex batted first and scored 68 for 6, and then restricted Yorkshire to 59 for 8. <b>Imran</b> Khan and Arnold bowled through the entire ten overs, taking three wickets each. A more facile victory provided Sussex with their place in the final; facing Lancashire, Sussex scored 277 for 8, helped by another half-century from Parker, and 75 runs from Javed Miandad, and then bowled their opponents out for 141 runs.|$|E

5|$|Emraan Hashmi, who {{appeared}} in the original film, was initially chosen to play the lead role. However, Luthria was looking for an older actor and chose Kumar {{for the role of}} Shoaib Khan (based on Dawood Ibrahim). In February 2012 it was announced that there were two male leads in the film, the second said to be Shahid Kapoor, but the following month <b>Imran</b> Khan was confirmed as the second male lead. Many actresses were considered for the female lead, including Illeana D'Cruz, Kareena Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, Asin Thottumkal, Sonam Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, but in April it was reported that Sonakshi Sinha had been cast. Sonali Bendre was also signed as a lead character in the film. The film marked Bendre's first role since Shankar Dada MBBS. Bendre did not charge her fees for the film owing to the fact that Sobha Kapoor, one of the producers of the film has been the friend of her Mother-in-law for the past 40 years also out of gratitude for Luthria, who shot her first song Sambhala hai Maine in the 1994 film Naaraaz. In November 2012, it was announced that the film was scheduled for release on Eid 2013. TV actor Chetan Hansraj was signed as an antagonist in the film. Kumar revealed during the trailer launch of the film about having no aspirations to set new benchmarks on a role previously enacted by Hashmi. Khan in preparation {{for his role in the}} film drew inspiration from Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor, copying their mannerisms, behaviour and dressing style by watching DVD's of films starring them produced in the 1980s. Back in those days copying mannerism of film stars drew appreciation from peers.|$|E
5|$|In WSC's debut {{season of}} 1977–78, Chappell hit the first Supertest century and {{finished}} fifth in overall averages. The prevalence of short-pitched fast bowling {{and a serious}} injury to Australian David Hookes led to the innovation of batting helmets; Chappell {{was one of the}} many batsmen to use one. Following their 1975–76 tour of Australia, the West Indies adopted a four-man fast bowling attack, while the World XI contained fast bowlers of the calibre of <b>Imran</b> Khan, Mike Procter, Garth Le Roux, Clive Rice and Sarfraz Nawaz. The constant diet of pace bowling undermined the confidence of some batsmen during WSC. Chappell's form fell away during the second season and he scored only 181 runs at 25.85 in four Supertests. During the last six days of the season, the WSC Australians lost the finals of both the limited-overs competition (to the West Indies XI) and the Supertest series (to the World XI), thus forfeiting the winner-takes-all prize money. After the latter match, Chappell vented his frustrations on World XI captain Tony Greig by refusing to shake his hand and criticising Greig's inconsequential contribution to his team's victory. The final act of the competition was a series between the WSC Australians and the WSC West Indies played in the Caribbean in the spring of 1979. After the Australians suffered a heavy defeat in the first Supertest at Jamaica, Chappell rallied his team to draw the five match series one-all. His best effort were scores of 61 and 86 at Barbados.|$|E
5|$|Sussex {{began their}} run-chase well; Barclay and Gehan Mendis scored 93 runs together, {{surviving}} a spell of attacking fast bowling from Garner and Dredge early on. Mendis had broken his thumb {{shortly before the}} final, and in the third over, it was fractured again, but he continued to bat. When Somerset did make a breakthrough, after 24 overs, they collected four wickets for the addition of seventeen runs. Mendis was the first man out, caught by Marks off the bowling of Graham Burgess, followed by Barclay who was caught hooking a delivery from Botham. Miandad was dismissed without scoring, and shortly thereafter, <b>Imran</b> was caught and bowled by Botham for three. Rose then chose to replace his bowlers, and against the less incisive bowling of Keith Jennings and Burgess, Parker and Paul Phillipson were able to establish a 97-run partnership, which brought Sussex to within five runs of their winning target, before Phillipson was by caught by the wicket-keeper, Derek Taylor off the bowling of Dredge. Woodcock thought that Botham in particular bowled too short against Phillipson, who he suggested would have been susceptible to a yorker. In Wisden, Eric Hill opined that Botham's short-pitched bowling, which was a feature of his play late in the season, was due to him being overused by England and Somerset through the year. Parker scored the winning runs to secure a five-wicket victory for Sussex with 41 deliveries remaining.|$|E
5|$|The Sussex captain, Arnold Long, won the toss {{and chose}} to bowl first, hoping that morning dew might give his bowlers an advantage. Brian Rose scored 14 {{runs from the}} first over, bowled by <b>Imran,</b> who later took Somerset's first wicket, bowling Denning before the batsman had scored a run. That brought Richards to the crease, and Long {{immediately}} changed both of his bowlers, replacing the quick bowling of the openers with the slower deliveries of Giles Cheatle and John Spencer. Cheatle dismissed Rose in his first over, caught down the leg side by the wicket-keeper, Long after scoring 44 runs. Peter Roebuck also got out to Cheatle, scoring nine runs before being caught by Mendis. Botham joined Richards in the middle, and immediately scored a four with a straight drive, followed by two hooks for sixes. Cheatle and Spencer each bowled their entire allocation of 12 overs without a break, and were followed {{by the introduction of}} another slow bowler, John Barclay. Although Richards finished as the competition's leading run-scorer, Woodcock said that he struggled to score fluently, particularly against the spin bowling of Barclay and Cheatle. In the Wisden Cricketers' Almanacks summary of the season, Jack Alridge praised Long's captaincy in the final, highlighting the use of slower bowling against Richards and Ian Botham as being particularly commendable. Vic Marks, who also played in the match for Somerset, suggested that Botham was the only Somerset batsman to play with freedom, and said {{that the rest of the}} team were nervous and intimidated by the prospect of winning Somerset's first trophy. Richards scored 44 runs, and Botham 80, including three sixes, but none of the rest of the middle- or lower-order batsmen made a significant score and Somerset finished their innings on 207 for 7. Along with Barclay, Spencer bowled particularly economically for Sussex.|$|E

25|$|The final {{began with}} eerie resemblances to same fixture {{earlier in the}} tournament when England bowled out Pakistan for a paltry 74, as Derek Pringle {{dismissed}} both Pakistani openers at 24. However, <b>Imran</b> Khan and Javed Miandad settled down to see off the new ball. A crucial moment occurred when <b>Imran</b> Khan was dropped by Graham Gooch at 9 runs. He later went on to score a match-winning 72. At the 25 over mark, Pakistan had only scored 70, but accelerated the score to 139 by the 31st over as Javed Miandad summoned a runner, and he and <b>Imran</b> Khan built a steady partnership. During his innings, <b>Imran</b> hit a huge six off Richard Illingworth that landed far back into the members section. <b>Imran</b> played a captain's innings, getting a score of 72 and Miandad 58 to steady the innings, expectedly followed by an onslaught from Inzamam (42) and Wasim Akram (33) enabling Pakistan to give England a fighting target of 250.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, {{the year}} after he retired, Botham became embroiled in a legal dispute with <b>Imran</b> Khan who, in an article for India Today, had accused Botham and Allan Lamb of {{bringing}} cricket into disrepute. Botham and Lamb instigated a libel action in response. The case was heard at the High Court in 1996 with the court choosing to hear {{on the second day}} a separate action brought solely by Botham against <b>Imran</b> who had suggested in a newspaper article that Botham had been involved in ball-tampering. This would become the subject of a court case later on, one that <b>Imran</b> would go on to win. Botham was liable for all expenses in the court case in the ruling, including those incurred by <b>Imran.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Imran</b> Ali (born 27 August 1987) is {{a former}} Pakistani cricketer who played several matches for Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) during the late 2000s. From Sahiwal, Punjab, <b>Imran</b> played five {{first-class}} matches for the team, with {{the first of these}} coming during the 2006–07 season and the last during the 2009–10 season. A right-handed batsman, he had little success—he passed double figures only once, with his highest score, 17 runs, achieved against Lahore Shalimar in December 2009. He finished his career with 36 runs from six innings, and failed to take any wickets from two overs bowling off-breaks. ESPNcricinfo, a cricket website, incorrectly lists <b>Imran</b> as also having played a single List A match for PIA during the 2007–08 season.
