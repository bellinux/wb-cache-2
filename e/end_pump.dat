40|$|In recent experiments, 80 -mW CW {{power in}} a single mode has been {{achieved}} from a neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser with only 1 W of electrical power input to a single semiconductor laser array pump. This corresponds to an overall efficiency of 8 percent, the highest reported CW efficiency for a Nd:YAG laser. A tightly focused semiconductor laser <b>end</b> <b>pump</b> configuration is used to achieve high pumping intensities (on the order of 1 kW/sq cm), which in turn causes the photon to photon conversion efficiency to approach the quantum efficiency (76 percent for Nd:YAG at 1. 06 microns pumped at 0. 810 micron). This is achieved despite the dual-lobed nature of the pump.

40|$|A laser {{medium in}} the form of a single mode optical fibre offers a number of {{attractive}} features. For example, using a laser to <b>end</b> <b>pump</b> such a fibre provided with feedback mirrors, allows a very low oscillation threshold to be attained. In the case of Nd doped fibre a GaAs diode laser can be used as the pump, thus providing a very simple and compact laser device. The low threshold performance also suggests that other, weaker transitions may be capable of laser action eg. the 1. 3 µm 4 F 3 / 2 to 4 I 13 / 2 transition in Nd or transitions in other dopants which have not previously shown laser action in a glass host. Other possible applications include the use of fibres as amplifiers e. g. as an in-line amplifier in an optical communication system where it could play the role of a repeater. As a power amplifier the fibre device could have advantages over the bulk glass systems by reducing the problems of thermal distortion and thermal fracture. In this paper we report some results obtained with neodymium-doped single mode fibres...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} {{high-power}} efficient solid-state lasers with good output beam quality {{has long been}} a general goal of many researchers within the solid-state laser community. Progress towards the realization of such solid-state lasers has mainly been limited by poor brightness and limited choice of operating wavelengths of the optical sources available to pump such lasers. This thesis presents the results of an investigation into a new approach for power and brightness scaling of two-micron solid-state lasers. The strategy described in this thesis is based on reduction of heat generation and heat loading within the laser medium. This was achieved by employing a fibre-bulk hybrid scheme; where a high-power diode-pumped double-clad fibre laser is used to <b>end</b> <b>pump</b> a bulk solid-state laser. Thus, the work described here is split into two related research areas. The first area of research was devoted to the construction of a high-power, tunable two-micron source based on thulium(Tm) -doped silica fibre. The result was a tunable Tm fibre laser that produced a maximum output power of 10. 5 W at a wavelength of 1921 nm for 44 W of launched diode power at 790 nm. The output of the laser was tunable over a wavelength range of 215 nm from 1855 nm to 2070 nm at multi-watt power levels, and over 150 nm from 1860 nm to 2010 nm at output power levels in excess of 9 W. In this part of the research results for the first wavelength-combined Tm-doped silica fibre laser system with maximum output power of 14 W on four lines at wavelengths, 1926 nm, 1957 nm, 1980 nm and 2000 nm, have also been presented. The aim of this work was to explore a new concept for power scaling in fibre lasers. The beam-combined system was tunable over a range of 200 nm from 1900 nm to 2100 nm at multi-watt power levels, and over a range of 120 nm, from 1900 nm to 2020 nm, at power levels in excess of 10 W. Beam propagation factors, M 2, of the beam-combined laser system were equal to; Mx 2 ~ 4. 9 and My 2 ~ 4, in the x-z and y-z planes, respectively. Potential sources of degradation in beam quality of the system were also investigated. In {{the second part of the}} research a high-power tunable Tm-doped silica fibre laser was used to end-pump a Ho:YAG crystal. Ho:YAG has been chosen due to its robust thermo-mechanical properties and favourable spectroscopic characteristics. Highly efficient room-temperature operation of a Ho:YAG laser has been demonstrated. 5. 2 W of output at 2097 nm in a near diffraction-limited beam from a Ho:YAG laser was achieved using 9. 1 W of incident pump power from a Tm-doped silica fibre laser at 1905 nm. The slope efficiency with respect to incident pump power (80 %) was close to the theoretical maximum taking into account the pump absorption efficiency, resonator losses and output coupling loss. The optical-to-optical efficiency of the laser was 57 %. Room-temperature laser operation of Ho:YAG lasers with different Ho 3 + concentrations was also investigated. The design and performance of these lasers for highly efficient continuous-wave operation is briefly discussed...|$|E

The rod is cooled by water passing through annular, which sur-rounds the active media. The temperature distribution has been used to predict numerically, the nodal displacements, strain and stress based on the principle of virtual work. The main task is to determine the temperature distribution in Nd:YAG laser rod, the subsequent value and location of maximum tensile hoop stress associated with the two types of the double <b>end</b> <b>pumping</b> for different ab-sorption power. Some conclusions are obtained; as the radius pumping ratio in-creases the location of maximum hoop stress will move toward the periphery and vice-versa. Small reduction is observed in the location of maximum hoop stress when pumping method change from the top-hat beam to Gaussian beam, espe-cially at low radius pumping ratio and high absorption power. Top hat beam <b>end</b> <b>pumping</b> will cause more intense tension hoop stress at the facets of the rod than that of Gaussian beam even the later may produce high center temperature.
