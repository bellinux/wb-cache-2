5|$|The {{motivations of}} the three in the infighting are not {{completely}} clear. According to Friedrich Katz, Madero, in refusing to let Navarro be killed, was motivated not only by his personal humanism but also by a need to assert his civilian authority over military leaders. It also seems that Villa was mostly concerned with {{taking care of his}} soldiers and his personal hatred for Navarro, since it was his soldiers—known as Villistas—who Navarro had earlier ordered to be bayoneted. Years later, after he fell out with Orozco, Villa wrote in his memoirs that the whole episode was a set-up by Orozco, who had been paid 50,000 pesos by Díaz's agents to get him to kill Madero. While Katz and other scholars consider this assessment extreme, it is possible that Orozco, who believed he should be the rightful leader of the revolution, was trying to provoke Villa into killing Madero. That way Madero would be out of the way, Villa would be discredited among the intellectual revolutionary circles as a common bandit and Orozco could claim the mantle of leadership. In the end, however, Villa kept his cool, Madero convinced common soldiers to support him and Orozco did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> go through with it.|$|E
25|$|In Los Angeles, Harlean befriended Rosalie Roy, a young {{aspiring}} actress. Lacking a car, Roy asked Harlean {{to drive}} her to Fox Studios for an appointment. Reputedly, Harlean was noticed and approached by Fox executives while waiting for her friend, but stated {{that she was not}} interested. Nevertheless, she was given dictated letters of introduction to Central Casting. A few days later, Rosalie Roy bet Harlean that she did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> go and audition. Unwilling to lose a wager and pressed by her enthusiastic mother, now back in Los Angeles, Harlean drove to Central Casting and signed in under her mother's maiden name, Jean Harlow.|$|E
500|$|Construction of the {{original}} route through Cajon Pass was overseen by Jacob Nash Victor, who by this time had become General Manager of the California Southern. [...] He operated the first train through the pass in 1885, proclaiming [...] "No other railroad will ever <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> build through these mountains. [...] All who follow will prefer to rent trackage from us." [...] Victor's assertion remained true for a while as the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad (which later became part of Union Pacific Railroad) signed an agreement to operate over the California Southern track via trackage rights on April 26, 1905, but Victor was proven wrong eighty years later when SP built the Palmdale Cutoff in 1967 at a slightly higher elevation through the pass. [...] In honor of his work through the pass, the city of Victorville was named after Victor.|$|E

500|$|Many of the German {{units were}} recent conscripts {{with very little}} experience. Sergeant Vinz Kuhlbach's platoon was typical. Most of his {{soldiers}} had little combat experience and even less training. The German units had been formed by conscripting teenage boys and men over 50, men previously rejected as physically unfit for service, wounded soldiers newly released from hospitals, and men transferred from the [...] "jobless" [...] personnel of the shrinking Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe. The German 3rd Fallschirmjäger [...] Division, which had previously acquired a superb combat reputation, had been virtually destroyed during the Normandy Invasion in the Falaise pocket. It had been resurrected by using replacements from the 22nd, 51st, and 53rd Luftwaffe Field Regiments. The German units were usually organized around small cadres of seasoned veterans. Although they carried the new StG 44 and were equipped with rifle grenades, few had ever fired them in combat. The German recruits were told the American soldiers they faced would not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> stand and fight. Their officers said the Americans were [...] "a gum-chewing, undisciplined half-breed with no stomach for real war." ...|$|E

[...] "That’s {{part of the reason}} I took the show, because I was like, holy cow, this was me in high school." [...] Burton said there are always stereotypes in high school. [...] "People get put into groups. [...] "You’re a jock, you’re a cheerleader, you’re a freak, you’re in the drama department. I had a lot of trouble fitting into those groups when I was in high school because I {{wanted to be a part}} of all of them," [...] she said. [...] "I think that’s how a lot of people are.

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times {{gave the}} film 4 out of 4 stars, stating that it is, [...] "a breathless, {{exciting}} story, heartbreaking and exhilarating." [...] Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern refers to Slumdog Millionaire as, [...] "the film world's first globalised masterpiece." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post argues that, [...] "this modern-day 'rags-to-rajah' fable won the audience award at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this year, and it's {{easy to see}} why. With its timely setting of a swiftly globalising India and, more specifically, the country's {{own version of the}} 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' TV show, combined with timeless melodrama and a hardworking orphan who withstands all manner of setbacks, 'Slumdog Millionaire' plays like Charles Dickens for the 21stcentury." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times describes the film as [...] "a Hollywood-style romantic melodrama that delivers major studio satisfactions in an ultra-modern way" [...] and [...] "a story of star-crossed romance that the original Warner brothers would have embraced, shamelessly pulling out stops that you wouldn't think anyone would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> attempt any more." [...] Anthony Lane of the New Yorker stated, [...] "There is a mismatch here. Boyle and his team, headed by the director of photography, Anthony Dod Mantle, clearly believe that a city like Mumbai, with its shifting skyline and a population of more than fifteen million, is as ripe for storytelling as Dickens's London [...] At the same time, the story they chose is sheer fantasy, not in its glancing details but in its emotional momentum. How else could Boyle get away with assembling his cast for a Bollywood dance number, at a railroad station, over the closing credits? You can either chide the film, at this point, for relinquishing any claim to realism or you can go with the flow—surely the wiser choice." [...] Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent was also full of praise, saying the film [...] "successfully mixes hard-hitting drama with uplifting action and the Who Wants To Be a Millionaire show is an ideal device to revolve events around". Several other reviewers have described Slumdog Millionaire as a Bollywood-style [...] "masala" [...] movie, due to the way the film combines [...] "familiar raw ingredients into a feverish masala" [...] and culminates in [...] "the romantic leads finding each other." ...|$|E
