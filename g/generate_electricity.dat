5|$|In 1986â€“87, a {{cogeneration}} {{facility was}} added to the central heating plant to <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> from the plant's waste heat. A Cornell Combined Heat & Power Project, which was completed in December 2009, shifted the central heating plant from using coal to natural gas and enable the plant to generate all of the campus's non-peak electric requirements.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma Gas & Electric, {{commonly}} referred to as OG (NYSE: OGE) operates four base electric power plants in Oklahoma. Two of them are coal-fired power plants: one in Muskogee, and the other in Redrock. Two are gas-fired power plants: one in Harrah and the other in Konawa. OG was the first electric company in Oklahoma to <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> from wind farms in 2003.|$|E

5000|$|A {{fuel cell}} is a device {{consisting}} of one positive electrode called the anode and one negative electrode called the cathode that <b>generates</b> <b>electricity</b> through chemical reactions. Hydrogen {{is the basic}} fuel for fuel cells, but fuel cells also require some oxygen. The push toward utilizing more fuel cells is based in the appeal of <b>generating</b> <b>electricity</b> cleanly. In the process of <b>generating</b> <b>electricity,</b> the hydrogen and oxygen used eventually combine to form water, a completely harmless byproduct.|$|R
5|$|The sea {{offers a}} very large supply of energy carried by ocean waves, tides, {{salinity}} differences, and ocean temperature differences which can be harnessed to <b>generate</b> <b>electricity.</b> Forms of 'green' marine energy include tidal power, marine current power, osmotic power, ocean thermal energy and wave power.|$|E
5|$|Design of {{the complex}} began in 2002, with {{construction}} beginning in 2003. After completion in 2005, the building was awarded the LEED Gold certification for sustainability, the second city hall in the United States to earn that distinction. Environmentally friendly technologies used include occupancy sensors, ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide levels to determine when to activate, high performance exterior glass to reduce heat loss, and solar panels to <b>generate</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly to <b>generate</b> <b>electricity,</b> or undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E

5|$|The {{power plant}} {{operates}} using a lower and upper reservoir {{along with a}} power plant connected to both. Water is either pumped from the lower to the upper reservoir to serve as stored energy or released from the upper to the lower reservoir to <b>generate</b> <b>electricity.</b> Pumping occurs during low demand, cheap electricity, periods such as night and generating will occur during peak demand, expensive electricity, hours such as during the day. The pumping/generating process repeats as needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{rainwater}} which {{falls on}} Poh Ern Shih is collected from surface run-offs and rain gutters {{and used to}} irrigate the temple grounds, {{as well as to}} <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> used for charging the batteries of in-house motorised wheelchairs. The electricity is produced by water from the highest floor of the temple passing through hydroelectric-generators. A purification system is also being installed, so that the collected rainwater can be filtered and made potable.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It {{relies on the}} very high rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E

5|$|Built by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), Oroville Dam {{is one of}} the key {{features}} of the California State Water Project (SWP), one of two major projects passed that set up California's statewide water system. Construction was initiated in 1961, and despite numerous difficulties encountered during its construction, including multiple floods and a major train wreck on the rail line used to transport materials to the dam site, the embankment was topped out in 1967 and the entire project was ready for use in 1968. The dam began to <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> shortly afterwards with completion of the Edward Hyatt Pump-Generating Plant, then the country's largest underground power station.|$|E
5|$|In its time, Dunston B Power Station ranked {{consistently}} in England's leading stations, both {{in terms}} of thermal efficiency and cost per unit of electricity. However, the station eventually became outdated, and notification of its partial closure was given in October 1975, with some units being closed the following October. It was then only used as a stand-by station, operating only at peak electrical demand times. Finally, after some units having been in operation for about 40years, the station ceased to <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> on 26 October 1981. At the time of closure, only 98MW of the station's capacity was in use.|$|E
5|$|North of Pentwater, US31 crosses into Mason County {{and passes}} Bass Lake and the Ludington Pumped Storage Power Plant, {{which uses a}} {{reservoir}} next to the freeway to <b>generate</b> <b>electricity.</b> Just north of that reservoir, the freeway turns to the northeast and Ludington's business spur runs off to the northwest. US31 curves around {{the east side of}} Ludington, crossing the Pere Marquette River. Due east of downtown, the freeway ends and US31 turns east to merge with US10. The concurrent highways follow a four-lane roadway to Scottville. On the west side of that town, US31 separates from US10, turning northward to bypass Scottville.|$|E

5|$|The Great Recession and {{the turmoil}} {{caused by the}} Arab Spring have {{depressed}} Jordan's GDP growth, damaging trade, industry, construction and tourism. Tourist arrivals have dropped sharply since 2011. Jordan's finances have also been severely strained by 32 attacks on the natural gas pipeline in Sinai supplying Jordan from Egypt by Islamic State affiliates, causing it to substitute more expensive heavy-fuel oils to <b>generate</b> <b>electricity.</b> In November 2012, the government cut subsidies on fuel, increasing its price. The decision, which was later revoked, caused large scale protests to break out across the country.|$|E
5|$|The Western {{industrial}} {{revolution of the}} 18th to 19th centuries tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to <b>generate</b> <b>electricity.</b> Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. In the mid-20th century, a gathering environmental movement {{pointed out that there}} were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed. In the late 20th century, environmental problems became global in scale.

5|$|Trying {{to come up}} with {{a better}} way to {{generate}} alternating current, Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to <b>generate</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|E

5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and <b>generate</b> <b>electricity,</b> and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used to <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995â€“1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E
5|$|NEERC is {{expected}} to be capable of handling up to 190,000 tonnes of waste per year. This waste will be burned to <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> for the National Grid and cogenerate to provide heat for local industries in the form of steam. NEERC will have two processing lines, capable of generating 21MW of electricity, enough to provide for 37,500 homes. This means that over the two facilities, 640,000 tonnes of waste will be burned annually, and over 50MW of electricity generated. This would make Teesside the largest operational EfW centre in the UK outside London. The plant will be a mirror image of the current one, and will create 160 jobs; 25 in South Tyne and Wear, 100 {{in the construction of the}} plant, and the rest once the plant is operational.|$|E
