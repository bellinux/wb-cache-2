This occurrence results in severe signal distortion and timing skew of the clock signal. The layout of <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> serpentine delay <b>line</b> can reduced crosstalk between lines. The waveform of <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> serpentine delay <b>line</b> has been investigated with simulation approach.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of quaternized poly- 2 -vinyl pyridine (PVP+), {{which has}} a fixed charge per monomer, onto a gold electrode was investigated using reflectometry. The <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> charge and potential of the gold substrate were controlled by means of either the solution pH or by applying an external potential. The adsorption process was monitored for various molecular masses and concentrations of PVP+, and {{as a function of}} the electrolyte concentration, the pH of the solution, and the externally applied potential on the gold electrode. The adsorption isotherms and the dependence on the background electrolyte concentration point to a high non-electrostatic affinity of PVP+ for the gold surface. The results for the two charging mechanisms (pH or applied potential) are very similar when compared by plotting the adsorbed amounts {{as a function of the}} <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> potential of the gold. The total adsorbed amount decreases linearly with the <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> potential of the gold. Adsorption takes place up to a relatively high <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> potential, in <b>line</b> with a relatively high contribution of non-electrostatic interactions.

40|$|Structural {{fire safety}} {{has become one}} of the key {{considerations}} in the design and maintenance of the built infrastructure. Conventionally the fire resistance rating of load bearing Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) walls is determined based on the standard time-temperature curve given in ISO 834. Recent research has shown that the true fire resistance of building elements exposed to building fires can be less than their fire resistance ratings determined based on standard fire tests. It is questionable whether the standard time-temperature curve truly represents the fuel loads in modern buildings. Therefore an equivalent fire severity approach has been used in the past to obtain fire resistance rating. This is based on the performance of a structural member exposed to a realistic design fire curve in comparison to that of standard fire time-temperature curve. This paper presents the details of research undertaken to develop an energy based time equivalent approach to obtain the fire resistance ratings of LSF walls exposed to realistic design fire curves with respect to standard fire exposure. This approach relates to the amount of energy transferred to the member. The proposed method was used to predict the fire resistance ratings of single and <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> plasterboard <b>lined</b> and externally insulated LSF walls. The predicted fire ratings were compared with the results from finite element analyses and fire design rules for three different wall configurations exposed to both rapid and prolonged fires. The comparison shows that the proposed energy method can be used to obtain the fire resistance ratings of LSF walls in the case of prolonged fires...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{mechanism for}} acceleration of auroral particles may be through electrostatic <b>double</b> <b>layers.</b> Birkeland-currents can create favorable conditions for <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> {{by reduction of}} the electron density at high altitudes.

Methods to observe <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> with rockets and satellites include measurements of pitch-angle distributions with high resolution, three-axis electric double probes, and topside sounders. Due to the small field-aligned extent (10 - 100 Debye-lengths) of <b>double</b> <b>layers,</b> they will only show up as spikes of short duration in the output signal of a double probe.
