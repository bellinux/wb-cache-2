Although it was not my choice to leave, it's time to enter a new chapter in my life ... Sometimes a breakdown in communication and lack of trust can result in many different things."

Love is seen playing her Jazzmaster in the music video for [...] "Miss World". Earlier in Hole's career, between 1989 and 1991, Love primarily played a Rickenbacker 425 because she [...] "preferred the 3/4 neck", but she destroyed the guitar onstage at a 1991 concert opening for The Smashing Pumpkins. In the mid-1990s, she often played a guitar made by Mercury, an obscure company that manufactured custom guitars, {{as well as a}} Univox Hi-Flier.

However Nilsson claims her [...] "explosive" [...] high notes that were her biggest asset on-stage [...] "have not been recorded like they should have been" [...] in the studio. She later lamented: [...] "It always made me a little bit sad when I heard my own recordings. And many people told me that I sang much better in person than I do on the recordings! That didn't flatter me at all, because I know what's going to be left when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> singing".

2500|$|In contrast, {{others have}} said that the zero {{mortality}} rate from the Fukushima incident confirms their opinion that nuclear fission is the only viable option available to replace fossil fuels.

[...] In it he said, [...] "As a result of the disaster at Fukushima, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> nuclear-neutral. I now support the technology." [...] He continued, [...] "A crappy old plant with inadequate safety features was hit by a monster earthquake and a vast tsunami. The electricity supply failed, knocking out the cooling system. The reactors began to explode and melt down. The disaster exposed a familiar legacy of poor design and corner-cutting. Yet, as far as we know, no one has yet received a lethal dose of radiation." ...|$|E
