25|$|Many people {{assert that}} this {{abandonment}} of the god hypothesis means the abandonment of all religion and all moral sanctions. This is simply not true. But <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>mean,</b> once our relief at jettisoning an outdated piece of ideological furniture is over, that we must construct something to take its place.|$|E
25|$|On Jefferson's {{isolated}} mountaintop, sex {{took place}} {{as part of}} a hierarchy that everyone involved understood. Jefferson, and those of his class, did not share our current understanding of sexual morality. Sally Hemings was his servant, and had little power. She was dependent economically, though this does not mean her feelings were irrelevant. But <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> that he had extraordinary power, and she very little, and so, as his concubine, she had probably replicated her mother's relationship with Jefferson's father-in-law; for she was, in fact, Jefferson's late wife's half-sister, and I have described the Hemings family as a parallel, subordinate family to the all-white Jeffersons.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} various {{influenza}} strains to show species-selectivity is {{largely due to}} variation in the hemagglutinin genes. Genetic mutations in the hemagglutinin gene that cause single amino acid substitutions can significantly alter the ability of viral hemagglutinin proteins to bind to receptors on the surface of host cells. Such mutations in avian H5N1 viruses can change virus strains from being inefficient at infecting human cells to being as efficient in causing human infections as more common human influenza virus types. This doesn't mean that one amino acid substitution can cause a pandemic, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> that one amino acid substitution can cause an avian flu virus that is not pathogenic in humans to become pathogenic in humans.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there are}} also tubes that operate in cold cathode mode, whereby {{electrons}} are liberated into the tube only by the large potential difference (voltage) between the electrodes. This {{does not mean the}} electrodes are cold (indeed, they can be very hot), but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> they are operating below their thermionic emission temperature. Because cold cathode lamps have no thermionic emission coating to wear out, they can have much longer lives than hot cathode tubes. This quality makes them desirable for maintenance-free long-life applications (such as backlights in liquid crystal displays). Sputtering of the electrode may still occur, but electrodes can be shaped (e.g. into an internal cylinder) to capture most of the sputtered material so it is not lost from the electrode.|$|E
25|$|What {{is notable}} {{is that the}} {{majority}} of these urban areas are in the upper reaches of either the Trent itself, {{as is the case with}} Stoke, or the tributaries. For example, Birmingham lies at the upper end of the Tame, and Leicester is located towards the head of the Soar. Whilst this is not unique for an English river, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> that there is an ongoing legacy of issues relating to urban runoff, pollution incidents, and effluent dilution from sewage treatment, industry and coal mining. Historically, these issues resulted in a considerable deterioration in the water quality of both the Trent, and its tributaries, especially the Tame. To bring clean water to the West Midlands, Birmingham Corporation created a large reservoir chain and aqueduct system to bring water from the Elan Valley.|$|E
25|$|Westcountry Television, another {{independent}} company, replaced Television South West at 00:00 GMT on 1 January 1993. The first programme {{aired on}} the channel was a video welcoming viewers to Westcountry and promising {{higher levels of}} regional commitment. Later, Westcountry was purchased by Carlton Television, {{and it is now}} simply part of the ITV Network. However, since that original commitment to regional programming in 1993 (and approximately 16 hours of regional programmes per week), in 2007 this had been reduced to less than seven hours per week. There is no longer any mention of Westcountry on the ITV network in Cornwall, except for a vague verbal mention before a local programme is shown. Despite this, Westcountry Television has remained committed to Cornwall since launch, and have two small news studios in the county at Truro and Penzance. There is also a five-minute opt-out, broadcast from Redruth transmitting station of news stories specific {{to the west of the}} ITV Westcountry region (there are three others, based in Barnstaple, Plymouth and Exeter.) <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> though that those viewers in the east of the county receive news aimed at Plymouth City and the South Hams areas, as the Caradon Hill transmitting station covers Plymouth and Mid and South Devon as well as east Cornwall.|$|E

500|$|A {{shortlist}} of nominees {{is published}} in April {{and the winner}} of the award, along with the winners of PFA Scotland's other annual awards, is announced at a gala event in Glasgow a few days later. [...] The award is regarded by the players themselves as extremely prestigious, with John Hartson commenting in 2005 that [...] "the award means a lot because it's voted by your fellow professionals" [...] and Shaun Maloney stating in 2006 that [...] "there is no better accolade than to be voted for by your peers and <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> a lot to me". In 2007 the SPFA was replaced by a new body, PFA Scotland, but the new organisation's awards are considered to be a direct continuation of the SPFA awards.|$|E

Although the extreme lack {{of water in the}} Great Basin makes this distinction of little current practical use, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> that in wetter times the lake that once filled Death Valley (Lake Manly) was the last stop for water flowing in the region, meaning the water there was saturated in dissolved materials. Thus the salt pans in Death Valley are among the largest in the world and are rich in minerals, such as borax and various salts and hydrates. The largest salt pan in the park extends [...] from the Ashford Mill Site to the Salt Creek Hills, covering some [...] of the valley floor. The best known playa in the park is the Racetrack, known for its moving rocks.|$|E
500|$|Duncan Preston (who {{appeared}} in Wood's 1981 teleplay Happy Since I Met You) {{was cast in}} weekly roles. He had even turned down {{the chance to play}} Shakespeare and an offer of a world tour as Hotspur in Henry IV, Part One at the same time. Preston later said, [...] "I was at a crossroads and I had the choice of going straight or going off at a tangent with Victoria, I chose the latter and she changed my life". Most famously playing the recurring role of Clifford in Acorn Antiques, he also advertised a men's bra, was [...] "Corin Huntley" [...] – a documentary presenter – and was the voice of the monster Crayola in Wood's parody of Doctor Who. Wood said of Duncan, [...] "He hasn't been exploited properly in the show because I tend to write parts for women, which is fair enough, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> that Duncan plays the bank manager or the man in the hotel. I don't like men's men. Duncan's mainly the sort of man who likes women, so you can talk to him about your ovaries and it causes no embarrassment". Preston said he was cast [...] "because I was so tall".|$|E

2500|$|The Trust agreed a 10-year {{option to}} regain {{ownership}} of the ground by repaying £4,500,000 in debt taken on by Kennedy. [...] Part of this deal requires that 30% of any transfer fees or annual profit are paid toward this deficit, and while contributions through these clauses mean that the Trust now require only £3,600,000 more to reacquire the ground, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> that the club do {{find it difficult to}} bring in funds for themselves.|$|E
2500|$|In many jurisdictions, {{after making}} the award, the {{tribunal}} will {{order that the}} losing party pays the legal costs of the winning party, and this may include the arbitrator's fees. [...] However, this {{does not affect the}} joint and several liability referred to above; but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> that the winning party may maintain a separate action against the losing party for the unpaid costs, or to be reimbursed for arbitrator's fees that the winning party has been forced to pay, but which the losing party was ordered to pay.|$|E
2500|$|An off spin bowler will bowl mostly off breaks, varying them by {{adjusting}} the line and length of the deliveries. Off breaks {{are considered to be}} one of the easier spin deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play. This is because the ball moves in towards the batsman's body, meaning the batsman's legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses the bat or takes an edge. This makes it difficult for the bowler to get the batsman out bowled or caught from an off break, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> there is a chance of leg before wicket, assuming the ball has not turned enough to miss the leg stump.|$|E

Of that latter performance, Toronto's The Globe and Mail wrote: Bel canto is a term too often bandied about, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> what it says: beautiful singing, but beautiful as distinct from merely pretty; beautiful not only in its musical sensitivity and accuracy of pitch {{in the face of}} extreme vocal challenges devised by the composer, but also in its penetration and detailed communication of the emotions encompassed in the music and drama.
