500|$|From {{the second}} episode onwards, a {{secondary}} opening sequence runs immediately {{after an initial}} teaser: as the Mysterons announce their latest threat against Earth, the [...] "Mysteron rings" [...] pass over the primary puppet cast {{in a number of}} environments to demonstrate the aliens' omnipresence. Meanwhile, the characters's Spectrum code names are flashed up on-screen. The Mysterons invariably begin their threat with the words, [...] "This is the voice of the Mysterons. We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear us, Earthmen." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{unprecedented}} size of {{the demonstrations}} was widely taken {{to indicate that the}} majority of people across the world opposed the war. However, the potential effect of the protests was generally dismissed by pro-war politicians. The Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, claimed that the protests were not representative of public opinion, saying [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> measure public opinion just by {{the number of people that}} turn up at demonstrations." [...] In the United States, the then National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice was reported as saying that the protests would [...] "not affect [...] determination to confront Saddam Hussein and help the Iraqi people".|$|E
2500|$|The Guardians Mikki Kendall wrote, [...] "In 'Flawless' (a {{track that}} leaked as 'Bow Down' over the summer), Beyonce quotes from author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's TedX talk 'We {{should all be}} feminists', adroitly {{addressing}} {{the idea that she}} is somehow anti-feminist for not fitting into the boxes others project onto her. It's clear that like a lot of black American women, the mainstream middle class white feminist narratives with which we are so familiar aren't necessarily compatible with Beyonce's view of herself. This album makes it clear that her feminism isn't academic; isn't about waves, or labels. It simply is a part of her {{as much as anything else}} in her life. She's pro-woman without being anti-man, and she wants the world to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be feminist on a personal level without sacrificing emotions, friendships or fun." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Me, Myself and Time" [...] was {{released}} as promotional single from the soundtrack. It {{was named the}} best song from the soundtrack. The song is from the episode [...] "Sonny with a Song" [...] in the series Sonny with a Chance. Sonny Munroe (played by Lovato) decides to express in song how <b>you</b> feel. She <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> not miss your chance, therefore, <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> all, when she has her and him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, it {{is stupid}} going to bed," [...] said Lily; [...] "but {{people in the}} country are stupid, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> Billiards, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> play all night by gas, is much better, isn't it?" ...|$|R
2500|$|So {{what can}} it mean when America {{says it will}} now protect its friends? It can only mean {{prejudice}} against Iraq. This stance plus maneuvers and statements which have been made has encouraged the UAE and Kuwait to disregard Iraqi rights. ... If you use pressure, we will deploy pressure and force. We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> harm us although we do not threaten you. But we too can harm you. Everyone can cause harm according to their ability and their size. We cannot {{come all the way}} to you in the United States, but individual Arabs may reach you. ... We do not place America among the enemies. We place it where we want our friends to be and we try to be friends. But repeated American statements last year made it apparent that America did not regard us as friends.|$|E
2500|$|While an {{undergraduate}} in {{college at the}} age of 22, the unmarried Ireland became pregnant with a daughter. After discussing the situation with her parents, she went to a special home for single mothers in Colorado where she gave birth. Ireland put the baby up for adoption, in what she called [...] "...one of the worst things that ever happened in my life" [...] and [...] "the hardest decision I've ever had to make in my life." [...] She later joined an adoption registry and re-united with her then adult daughter in 1997. Ireland chose to speak out about the adoption as a Justice, saying [...] "I wanted to help reduce some of the shame around issues of adoption and let young people <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be a birth parent and still go on and have a successful career and a successful life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Nazis on the {{one hand}} would jam {{transmissions}} from the Allies' stations, {{but on the other hand}} would also copy them. The band Charlie and His Orchestra is considered as a negative example, also called Mr. Goebbels Jazz Band. Several of Germany’s most talented swing musicians, such as saxophonist Lutz Templin and vocalist Karl “Charlie” Schwedler, were active in a Jazz band. Here the Nazis replaced the original texts with their own provocative propaganda texts that were pro-Nazi and anti-American/British. For example, the lyrics for “Little Sir Echo” has anti-American/British appeal with lyrics such as “German U-boats are making you sore, You’re always licked, not a victory came through…You’re nice, little fellow, but by now you should <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> never win this war!” [...] Goebbels’ propaganda was broadcast over pirated short-wave frequencies into America, Britain, and Canada in order to spread fear and weaken the morale of Germany’s enemies (WFMU Staff).|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ah no! No!' cried Dragomiroff at my side. I {{could feel}} the old man tremble. 'I do not <b>know</b> all <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do, but be kind! I ask {{you to be a}} little kind to them below! This is horrible--horrible!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is also true," [...] {{returned}} the youth mournfully. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> never make me an angekok. Perhaps {{it would be}} better not to try." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{first class}} logic {{in the strict sense}} {{was created by}} Giuseppe Peano in 1889 as the basis for his {{arithmetic}} (Peano Axioms). He introduced the class term, which formally correctly describes classes through a property of their elements. Today the class term is denoted in the form {x|A(x)}, where A(x) is an arbitrary statement, which all class members x meet. Peano axiomatized the class term {{for the first time and}} used it fully. Gottlob Frege also tried establishing the arithmetic logic with class terms in 1893; Bertrand Russell discovered a conflict in it in 1902 which became known as Russell's paradox. As a result, it became generally <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> not safely use class terms.|$|R
6000|$|... "Speak plainly, old stranger," [...] {{said the}} squatter, {{striking}} {{the butt of}} his rifle heavily on the earth, his dull capacity finding no pleasure in a discourse that was conducted in so obscure allusions; [...] "I have asked a simple question, and one I <b>know</b> well <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As regards {{my present}} {{happiness}} and rest {{in this world}} they will be so. Of course I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> nothing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say or do will hurt me beyond <b>that.</b> But <b>you</b> might help me even to that further and greater bliss. You might help me too in that--as I also might help you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{not sure}} of me yet, Stephen, and I don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be blamed. It's a nasty knock, but {{we have got to}} bear it. Stop there a few minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the truth}} about me," [...] Burton protested, [...] "may not be {{the truth about}} this food. How do you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{reproduce}} the beans at all in an artificial manner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{be of any}} use--I don't {{know that}} I ought to speak to you. But I thought you might perhaps save me from--save my taking a false step." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{never had}} a home exactly," [...] {{explained}} Mrs. Phillips, during their journey in the tram. [...] "It's always been lodgings, up to now. Nice enough, some of them; {{but you know what}} I mean; everybody else's taste but your own. I've always fancied a little house with one's own things in it. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> things <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get fond of." ...|$|R
40|$|Everyone <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> read a {{galloping}} {{horse in}} a still image as galloping. This paper asks {{how it is}} that we perceive motion in pictures. It considers perception of real motion in point-light experiments and the perception of motion in stills via the work of various psychologists, in the course of which it raises theoretical questions about the nature of visual perception. It then offers a detailed examination of knowledge regarding neural substrates for both real and depicted motion perception. Finally, it combines psychological and neurophysiological perspectives with phenomenologically-oriented observation of pictures, discussing both frontoparallel motion and motion in depth (in particular the phenomenon of “looming”) in terms of two kinds of depictions, the “narrative” and the “performative”. Examples are drawn from all kinds of pictures, but focus is on world rock art, whose time depth is especially amenable to the universalist approach adopted by the paper...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the verbal}} assaults between Presley and Bond, the pair {{remained}} friends until Bond's {{departure from the}} band in 1984. Presley later said, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>know</b> somebody <b>that</b> well, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say almost anything." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, in {{the only}} way we girls can do it. We can't preach and pray in streets and bar-rooms, but we may at home, and in our own little world show that we want to use our {{influence}} for good.

6000|$|... "Ben-Ahmed, I {{told you}} the truth at first. I {{do not know where}} she is hiding. I did, indeed, know some time ago, but the place of her abode has been changed, and I do not know now.

6000|$|... "You {{have only}} to fancy your {{principle}} a spirit, a being with mind, Raoul, to have the Christian's God.

Your principles can be thwarted even by yourself--the seed can be deprived of its power to grow--the tree destroyed; and, if principles can thus be destroyed, some accident may one day destroy creation by destroying its principle. I fear {{to speak to you}} of revelation, Raoul, for I know you mock it!" ...|$|R
