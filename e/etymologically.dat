5|$|Scholarly {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} <b>etymologically</b> connecting the einherjar to the Harii (a Germanic tribe attested in the 1st century AD), the eternal battle of Hjaðningavíg, and the Wild Hunt. The einherjar {{have been the subject}} of works of art and poetry.|$|E
5|$|The term is <b>etymologically</b> {{related to}} Modern English hall and {{therefore}} also Valhalla, an afterlife 'hall of the slain' in Norse Mythology. Hall and its numerous Germanic cognates derive from Proto-Germanic *hallō 'covered place, hall', from Proto-Indo-European *kol-.|$|E
5|$|Tung oil: The {{tung oil}} tree {{originates}} in southern China and was cultivated there for tung oil, but the date of cultivation remains unknown. During the Song Dynasty, tung oil was used for waterproofing on ships. Tung oil is <b>etymologically</b> derived from the Chinese tongyou.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} too few {{published}} studies on the etymology of the figure of Wade's Bel (whether that refers to his milkmaid wife or to the cow) to provide a firm etymological or mythological basis. Wade is firmly rooted in Norse mythology and there are parallels between Wade's cow/milkmaid wife Bel and the milkmaid figure of Beyla in Norse mythology, who some authorities have suggested derives <b>etymologically</b> from baula, meaning cow. There is no published work suggesting such a link, so {{the origin of the}} figure remains unproven.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} assigned labour quotas {{for each}} district to native commissioners across the territory {{who in turn}} called on local chiefs and headmen to provide workers. The tribal leaders decided who was required at the kraal and who would report to the district native commissioner for work. This system, known locally as the chibaro, cibbalo, isibalo or chipara—according to Charles van Onselen, synonymous <b>etymologically</b> with concepts ranging from contract labour to slavery—had been relatively widespread during Company rule (1890–1923), but {{had fallen out of}} use by the 1930s. Some tribal communities were resettled {{to make room for the}} airstrips.|$|E

25|$|Variant spellings of {{the given}} name Randall include: Randal, Randel, Randell, and Randle. Randal {{is also used}} as an Anglicised form of the Irish and Scottish Gaelic Raghnall (to which it is <b>etymologically</b> unrelated). Although Randal is {{generally}} Gaelicised as Raghnall in Ireland (and sometimes Rághnall), the Irish Rannulbh more accurately represents Randulph and Randulf. A pet form of Randall is Randy; this name is , and is also a pet form of several other <b>etymologically</b> related, and unrelated names.|$|E
25|$|Names <b>etymologically</b> {{related to}} Weeks include {{but may not}} be limited to: Weekes, Wicks, Weech, Week, Weeke, Wich, Wych, Weetch, Wick, Wickes, Wix, Wike, Witch, Wykes, Whick, and Vik.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the names}} listed, Annikki and Marjatta are <b>etymologically</b> related to Anna and Maria, {{but they are}} {{characters}} in the Kalevala, not used as given names before the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|<b>Etymologically,</b> jippon {{is similar}} to nippon {{in that it is}} an {{alternative}} reading of 日本. The initial character 日 may also be read as /ziti/ or /zitu/. Compounded with -fon (本), this regularly becomes jippon.|$|E
25|$|<b>Etymologically,</b> vowels with {{an acute}} accent in these {{languages}} correspond to their Old Norse counterparts, which were long vowels {{but in many}} cases have become diphthongs. The only exception is é, which in Faroese has become æ.|$|E
25|$|Many {{names that}} are <b>etymologically</b> related to Maria are also used. The most common {{is the name}} Mariana, a {{contraction}} of Maria and Ana. Other international aglutinations of Maria combinations have been introduced in more recent times. These include Marisa, Marlene, Marília and Míriam (from Hebrew).|$|E
25|$|This sound {{change was}} incomplete, in that all Baltic and Slavic {{languages}} have instances where PIE palatovelars appear as *k and *g, often in doublets (i.e. <b>etymologically</b> related words, where {{one has a}} sound descended from *k or *g and the other has a sound descended from *ś or *ź).|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 15th/early 16th-century Middle Cornish play Beunans Ke, Arthur's sword is called Calesvol, which is <b>etymologically</b> an exact Middle Cornish cognate of the Welsh Caledfwlch. It is unclear if {{the name was}} {{borrowed}} from the Welsh (if so, {{it must have been}} an early loan, for phonological reasons), or represents an early, pan-Brittonic traditional name for Arthur's sword.|$|E
25|$|Vada is {{a common}} subordinator in Araki, {{probably}} deriving <b>etymologically</b> from the root vadai 'say, tell'. When used in a topic clause, vada is most often associated to Realis mood. It can refer either to a single event in the past (English 'when'), to a generic event in the global situation (English 'whenever'), or to a possible event in the future (English 'when', 'if', 'in case').|$|E
25|$|The another known {{thesis of}} the Iranian theory was by Stjepan Krizin Sakač, who {{although}} gave insights on some issues, {{tried to follow}} the Croatian ethnonym as far the region Arachosia (Harahvaiti, Harauvatiš) and its people (Harahuvatiya) of the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BCE). However, although the suggestive similarity, it is <b>etymologically</b> incorrect. There were many supporters of the thesis and further tried to develop it, but the actual arguments are considered far fetched and unscientific.|$|E
25|$|The {{analogous}} phenomenon {{occurs to}} a much lesser degree in Chinese varieties, where there are literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters – borrowed readings and native readings. In Chinese these borrowed readings and native readings are <b>etymologically</b> related, since they are between Chinese varieties (which are related), not from Chinese to Japanese (which are not related). They thus form doublets and are generally similar, analogous to different on'yomi, reflecting different stages of Chinese borrowings into Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Later {{evidence}} for place-names {{may not be}} as indicative of naming in the immediate post-Roman period as was once assumed. In names attested up to 731, 26% are <b>etymologically</b> partly non-English, and 31% have since fallen from use. Settlements and land tenure may have been relatively unstable in the post-Roman period, leading to a high natural rate of place-name replacement, enabling names coined in the increasingly dominant English language to replace names inherited from the Roman period relatively swiftly.|$|E
25|$|The Tewahedo Church Biblical Canon {{contains}} 81 books, including {{almost all}} of those which are accepted by other Orthodox and Oriental Christians; the exception is the Books of the Maccabees, {{at least some of}} which are accepted in the Eastern Orthodox and other Oriential Orthodox churches, but not in the Tewahedo churches (the books of Meqabyan, which are accepted instead, have an <b>etymologically</b> connected name, but rather different content). The Eritrean Orthodox canon and the Ethiopian Orthodox canon are identical.|$|E
25|$|The {{early history}} of the {{triangular}} frame harp in Europe is contested. The first instrument associated with the harping tradition in the Gaelic world {{was known as a}} cruit. This word may originally have described a different stringed instrument, being <b>etymologically</b> related to the Welsh crwth. It has been suggested that the word clàrsach / cláirseach (from clàr / clár, a board) was coined for the triangular frame harp which replaced the cruit, and that this coining was of Scottish origin.|$|E
25|$|Daeva, the Iranian {{language}} term, {{should not}} be confused with the devas of Indian religions. While the word for the Vedic spirits and the word for the Zoroastrian entities are <b>etymologically</b> related, their function and thematic development is altogether different. The once-widespread notion that the radically different functions of Iranian daeva and Indic deva (and ahura versus asura) represented a prehistoric inversion of roles is no longer followed in 21st century academic discourse (see In comparison with Vedic usage for details).|$|E
25|$|Another {{source for}} the concept may have {{originated}} from the translation of the Hebrew word re'em into Greek as μονόκερως, monokeros, in the Septuagint. In Psalm 22:21, the word karen, meaning horn, is written in singular. The Roman Catholic Vulgata and the Douay-Rheims Bible translated re'em as rhinoceros; other translations are names for a wild bull, wild oxen, buffalo, or gaur, but in some languages a word for unicorn is maintained. The Arabic translation alrim is the most correct choice <b>etymologically,</b> meaning 'white oryx'.|$|E
25|$|This {{changed when}} Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb and the Icelandic grammarian and {{politician}} Jón Sigurðsson published a written standard for Modern Faroese in 1854, which still exists. They {{set a standard}} for the orthography of the language, based on its Old Norse roots and {{similar to that of}} Icelandic. This had the advantage of being <b>etymologically</b> clear, as well as keeping the kinship with the Icelandic written language. The actual pronunciation, however, often differs from the written rendering. The letter ð, for example, has no specific phoneme attached to it.|$|E
25|$|Sources {{disagree}} {{as to who}} the Ngarrindjeri were. The missionary George Taplin chose it, spelling {{the term}} as Narrinyeri, as a generic ethnonym to designate a unified constellation several distinct tribes, and bearing the meaning of 'belonging to people', as opposed to 'kringgari (whites). <b>Etymologically,</b> it {{is thought to be}} an abbreviation of kornarinyeri ('belonging to men/human beings', formed narr (linguistically plain or intelligible) and inyeri, a suffix indicating belongingness. It implied that those outside the group were not quite human. Other terms were available, for example, Kukabrak, but Taplin's authority popularized the other term.|$|E
25|$|<b>Etymologically,</b> a notary is one {{who takes}} notes. Notes are signs or cursory {{abbreviations}} to record the words uttered, {{so that they may}} be reproduced later in ordinary writing. Notaries were at first private secretaries, attached to the service of persons in positions of importance. It was natural for the science of notes to be in high esteem among those employed in recording the transactions of public boards, and for the name notary to be applied to these officials; so that before long the word was used to signify their occupation.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{definition of}} sleep paralysis was codified by Samuel Johnson in his A Dictionary of the English Language as nightmare, {{a term that}} evolved into our modern definition. Such sleep paralysis was widely considered the work of demons, and more specifically incubi, which were thought {{to sit on the}} chests of sleepers. In Old English the name for these beings was mare or mære (from a proto-Germanic *marōn, cf. Old Norse mara), hence comes the mare in the word nightmare. The word might be <b>etymologically</b> cognate to Greek Marōn (in the Odyssey) and Sanskrit Māra.|$|E
25|$|The wars' {{effect on}} the Finns' society contributed to the {{eventual}} Swedish conquest of western Finland in around 1249. The term used in Russian chronicles to refer to Novgorod's enemy, Yem, is unclear and probably referred to several different groups, even though <b>etymologically</b> it derives from the Finnish word Häme, which means Tavastia. Some of the groups identified as Yem {{may have been the}} inhabitants of Tavastland in south-central Finland, the West Finns in general, or a sub-group of Karelians on the northern coast of the Ladoga who descended from western Finns who had moved to the area earlier.|$|E
25|$|The word satyagraha {{itself was}} coined through a public contest that Gandhi {{sponsored}} through the newspaper he published in South Africa, 'Indian Opinion', {{when he realized}} that neither the common, contemporary Hindu language nor the English language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions when he talked about his nonviolent approaches to conflict. According to Gandhi's autobiography, the contest winner was Maganlal Gandhi (presumably no relation), who submitted the entry 'sadagraha', which Gandhi then modified to 'satyagraha'. <b>Etymologically,</b> this Hindic word means 'truth-firmness', and is commonly translated as 'steadfastness in the truth' or 'truth-force'.|$|E
25|$|Shakespeare's play {{is based}} on various {{accounts}} of the semi-legendary Brythonic figure Leir of Britain, whose name has been linked by some scholars to the Brythonic god Lir/Llŷr, though in actuality the names are not <b>etymologically</b> related. Shakespeare's most important source is probably the second edition of The Chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande by Raphael Holinshed, published in 1587. Holinshed himself found {{the story in the}} earlier Historia Regum Britanniae by Geoffrey of Monmouth, which was written in the 12th century. Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, published 1590, also contains a character named Cordelia, who also dies from hanging, as in King Lear.|$|E
25|$|Lydus understands Consivius as βουλαιον (consiliarius) {{owing to}} a {{conflation}} with Consus through Ops Consiva or Consivia. The interpretation of Consus as god of advice is already present in Latin authors and {{is due to}} a folk etymology supported by the story of the abduction of the Sabine women, (which happened {{on the day of the}} Consualia aestiva), said to have been advised by Consus. However no Latin source cites relationships of any kind between Consus and Janus Consivius. Moreover, both the passages that this etymology requires present difficulties, particularly as it seems Consus cannot be <b>etymologically</b> related to adjective consivius or conseuius, found in Ops Consivia and thence the implied notion of sowing.|$|E
25|$|Vitruvius is {{sometimes}} loosely {{referred to as}} the first architect, but it is more accurate to describe him as the first Roman architect to have written surviving records of his field. He himself cites older but less complete works. He was less an original thinker or creative intellect than a codifier of existing architectural practice. It {{should also be noted that}} Vitruvius had a much wider scope than modern architects. Roman architects practised a wide variety of disciplines; in modern terms, they could be described as being engineers, architects, landscape architects, surveyors, artists, and craftsmen combined. <b>Etymologically</b> the word architect derives from Greek words meaning 'master' and 'builder'. The first of the Ten Books deals with many subjects which now come within the scope of landscape architecture.|$|E
25|$|Pipil lacks some {{grammatical}} features {{present in}} Classical Nahuatl, {{such as the}} past prefix o- in verbs. It distributes others differently: for example, 'subtractive' past formation, which is very common in the classical language, exists in Pipil but is much rarer. On the other hand, reduplication to form plural nouns, of more limited distribution {{in the language of}} the Aztecs, is greatly generalised in Pipil. Still other grammatical features that were productive in Classical Nahuatl have left only fossilised traces in Pipil: for example, synchronically Pipil has no postpositions, although a few lexical forms derive <b>etymologically</b> from older postpositional forms, e.g. apan 'river' < *'in/on the water', kujtan 'uncultivated land, forest' < *'under the trees'; these are synchronically unanalyzable in modern Pipil.|$|E
25|$|There several variant spellings of the English given name; {{these include}} Randal, Randel, Randell, and Randle. The pet form is Randy. The form Randal has also {{used as an}} Anglicisation of an <b>etymologically</b> {{unrelated}} Irish and Scottish Gaelic name Raghnall,. This Anglicisation has been noted as being particularly common amongst several Irish families of note. Randal has not been among the 1,000 most popular masculine baby names in the United States since 1994, and Randall {{has been among the}} top 1,000 names since 1906. According to US Census data, in 1990 both names were among the top 500 most popular masculine names in the country. Neither name is currently among the 100 most popular masculine (or feminine) baby names in either the United Kingdom nor the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
