5|$|It is {{different}} for places with a Mediterranean climate. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> {{during the cold}} season from September–May, extratropical cyclones from the Pacific Ocean move inland into the region due to a southward migration of the jet stream during the cold season. This shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather {{very similar to the}} western United States in this regard.|$|E
5|$|Mount Bailey {{is part of}} the High Cascades <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> The High Cascades {{have long}} been glaciated, by both Pacific-bred storms and natural, elevation-caused, {{glaciation}}.

Creating lava plateaus, Pliocene activity, mostly basaltic and andesitic, was probably responsible for the original cones at Bailey, Thielsen, and Union Peak.|$|E

5|$|Amnesic {{shellfish}} poisoning (ASP) {{was first}} reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It {{is caused by}} the substance domoic acid found in certain diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae out of the water. Domoic acid is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, gastroenteritis, long-term neurological problems or death. In an outbreak <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in 1993, finfish were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms. In the United States and Canada, a regulatory limit of 20µg/g of domoic acid in shellfish meat is set.|$|E
