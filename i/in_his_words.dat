5|$|The {{interdisciplinary}} state commission includes {{officials from}} the Bulgarian ministries of defence, economy and finance and, according to the caretaker government's deputy prime minister and minister of defence Stefan Yanev, {{the main reason for}} choosing the Swedish contestant is the favourable financial terms offered by Saab, including a lease option and offset agreements. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>words,</b> the Swedish offer accounts for about one billion BGN for the aircraft alone ($834 million), while the US/Portuguese one accounts a price of about one and a half billion BGN for the aircraft alone. The decision is pending the approval of the next regular Bulgarian government and, more importantly, of the Bulgarian Parliament. The second-place offer is to be retained as a back-up option, should the negotiations with Saab not be concluded successfully, as the financial resources for this program are budgeted until the end of 2017. The new fighters are to replace both the MiG-29 fighters of Graf Ignatievo Air Base and the Su-25 attack aircraft of Bezmer Air Base, as well as to fill the gap left by the retirement of the country's dedicated Su-22 reconnaissance airplanes.|$|E
25|$|The younger Balašević {{grew up on}} Jovan Cvijić {{street in}} Novi Sad, {{in the same house}} where he {{currently}} lives. He started writing poetry in primary school. He left high school in the third year (because, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>words,</b> he hated subjects like mathematics, physics and chemistry) but managed to get a high school diploma as part-time student and passed the preliminary exam for the university study of geography. He never graduated from the university. Instead, he joined the band Žetva (Harvest) in 1977.|$|E
25|$|In response, Zemskov {{wrote that}} the charge that Zemskov {{allegedly}} did not compare new data with already known information could not be called fair. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>words,</b> the trouble with most western writers {{is that they do}} not benefit from such comparisons. Zemskov added that when he tried not to overuse the juxtaposition of new information with “old” one, it was only because of a sense of delicacy, not to once again psychologically traumatize the researchers whose works used incorrect figures, as it turned out after the publication of the statistics by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD.|$|E

His book, Preston Sturges by Preston Sturges: His Life <b>in</b> <b>His</b> <b>Words,</b> was published in 1990 by Simon & Schuster. In 1975, he became the first writer to be given the Screen Writers Guild's Laurel Award posthumously. He has a star dedicated to him on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 1601 Vine Street.|$|E
25|$|A {{major element}} of Prompto's {{character}} is his humble origins {{when compared to}} Gladiolus and Ignis, expressing this <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>words</b> and actions. Prompto's facial features and hairstyle underwent multiple redesigns, the more recent ones based on negative feedback from fans, {{so that he would}} have international appeal. As {{with the rest of the}} party, he is dressed in black due to its specific significance to the Lucian royal family. The character was initially unpopular with series fans, so the team designed Prompto's photography hobby—and its subsequent gameplay and story interactions—as a way of making him useful and enabling each player to chronicle their journey through the game. Tabata later defined Prompto's camera as a manifestation of Prompto's wish to record Noctis and Lunafreya's journey. Prompto proved to be the starting point for Brotherhood, as producer Akio Ofuji conceived the series based around wanting to expand upon a backstory created by staff surrounding his difficult childhood. For Prompto's English performance, Inoue based him on the titular protagonist of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.|$|E
