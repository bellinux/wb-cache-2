3000|$|The {{distribution}} {{and treatment of}} harmful gas (H 2 S) in the Liaohe Oilfield, Northeast China, were investigated in this study. It was found that abundant toxic gas (H 2 S) is generated in thermal recovery of heavy oil. The H 2 S gas is mainly formed during thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) occurring in oil reservoirs or the thermal decomposition of sulfocompounds (TDS) in crude oil. H 2 S generation is controlled by thermal recovery time, temperature and the injected chemical compounds. The quantity of SO 4 2 − [...] in the injected compounds is the most influencing factor for the rate of TSR reaction. Therefore, for prevention of H 2 S formation, periodic and effective monitoring should be undertaken and adequate H 2 S absorbent should also be provided during thermal recovery of heavy oil.

For wafer probe applications, conventionally electrodeposited Ni-alloy beams with a typical thickness of 40 to 75 μm are produced as probe beams. The internal stress in these deposits is one of the primary causes of early failures in cycle testing of probe springs. The deposition of Ni alloys as multilayer films was investigated previously to improve the strength and ductility of Ni–Cu [2] with a Cu interlayer thickness of 0. 4 μm.

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), {{on behalf of the}} U. S. -China Clean Energy Research Center, has evaluated the technology using location-specific economic parameters to reflect power generation loss from a coal-fired power generation plant due to amine regeneration, the necessary utility constraints and investment, and the constraints of the location. The conceptual design used for cost estimates consists of a pre-absorption cooler (cooling by injection of water directly into the flue gas was not feasible because of 100 % flue gas humidity post-flue gas <b>desulfurizer),</b> an absorber with a spray stage to minimize evaporative amine losses; an economizing heat exchanger and trim heaters and coolers: a stripper with a reboiler and condenser to recover absorbed CO 2; a five-stage CO 2 compression train with intercooling and water removal; and an ion exchange process to control build-up of heat-stable salts by treating a bleed stream from the lean amine stream. We conclude that Huaneng's novel amine composition, because of the use of hindered and tertiary amines, has a lower heat of regeneration and hence reduces the power generation penalty. Further, we assess that the hindered and tertiary amines are less susceptible to thermal and oxidative degradation, although they are still susceptible to degradation by reaction with CO 2. We estimate the reduced power generation penalty and reduced solvent degradation gives a modest but tangible cost advantage relative to 30 % MEA. Among the location-specific constraints we have identified are: limited ability to cool incoming flue gas by water injection because of high humidity; and poor soil conditions that would require extensive civil engineering prior to plant construction. These differences we assess will increase the cost of implementing an amine-based capture technology over costs based on assumed greenfield construction...|$|E
