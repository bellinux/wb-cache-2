40|$|The mass {{spectral}} decomposition of the 1 -tetralol derivatives 2, 3 and 4 {{in view of}} the retro Diels-Alder reaction is investigated, for which deuterated derivatives, high resolution data and metastable peaks were used. By these studies it follows that the <b>decyclisation</b> reaction on ring A possesses the character of a retro Diels-Alder reaction only in some part. The main {{mass spectral}} degradation is forced by the substituents placed thereon...|$|E
