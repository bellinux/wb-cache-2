5|$|While Homer {{longs for}} his wife, Moe comes by the Simpsons' house to declare his {{interest}} in Marge, who turns him down. When Homer comes into the house with flowers he picked for Marge, Moe sees him and jumps out the window. Standing before her <b>in</b> <b>rags,</b> Homer professes his total and utter dependency on Marge, and she tells him {{that that is not}} a good thing, but Homer then makes his winning argument: he loves her, he needs her to love him, and can not afford to ever lose her trust again or he will end up dead. Marge is won over and allows Homer to return to the house. The family is glad that he has returned, although Moe is less than thrilled.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the longstanding}} {{danger of a}} Portuguese attack, the {{situation}} of the Spanish force in Badajoz was dreadful. The garrison suffered from a lack of ammunition and supplies, the soldiers were dressed <b>in</b> <b>rags</b> or were practically nude, and there was none among the civilian population of the town trained to wield a weapon. The Duke of San German put soldiers and civilians to work on the fortifications and storing food. The Portuguese sappers, meanwhile, proceeded to prepare the field for an assault upon the fortress. Mendes de Vasconcelos had decided, in a war council with many other senior officers, to attack Fort San Cristóbal, a key point in the Badajoz defenses. This fort, built after 1640, covered a bridgehead over the Guadiana river, thus guarding access to the city. A redoubt was quickly strengthened on the bridgehead by the Spanish sappers, who, protected by the Duke of Osuna and his cavalry, also widened the trenches which connected it with Fort San Cristóbal, the garrison of which was being strengthened every day along a strongly defended communication road.|$|E
5|$|While {{food was}} {{extremely}} {{hard to come}} by, an even more pressing need was obtaining drinking water. Thirst {{and the search for}} water are mentioned in most of the Robinsons' memoirs. The most common sources originally included toilet cisterns, boilers, and standing water found inside bathtubs. As these ran out, those in hiding were forced to risk sneaking access to wells, which were often guarded by German soldiers. Some memoirs describe long periods observing a particular well and waiting for a chance to obtain a quick drink. Another method involved obtaining polluted sewer water from the canals, and then filtering it through coals wrapped <b>in</b> <b>rags.</b> Generally, records indicate that whatever scant water supplies existed were shared fairly among individuals hiding as a group. In at least one instance, one person was unable to withstand the thirst and drank the whole group's water supply. As a result, Jakub Wiśnia, a former Gęsiówka inmate and after its liberation, a Home Army soldier, was court-martialed by his fellow group members and sentenced to death. The execution was to be postponed until after liberation, but when that occurred, the Robinsons were so overwhelmed with joy, the crime was forgiven and the sentence was never mentioned again.|$|E

The retreating Japanese had burned down the jail housing Burmese prisoners. They had also destroyed St. Philomena's Convent, which had {{been used as a}} hospital, killing 400 of their own men.

25|$|Two years later, on a {{scorching}} {{hot summer}} night, Carnehan creeps into the narrator's office. He is a broken man, a crippled beggar clad <b>in</b> <b>rags</b> {{and he tells}} an amazing story. Dravot and Carnehan succeeded in becoming kings: traversing treacherous mountains, finding the Kafirs, mustering an army, taking over villages, and dreaming of building a unified nation and even an empire. The Kafirs (pagans, not Muslims) were impressed by the rifles and Dravot's lack of fear of their idols, and acclaimed him as a god, the reincarnation or descendant of Alexander the Great. They show a whiter complexion than others of the area ("so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with old friends") implying their ancient lineage to Alexander himself. The Kafirs practised a form of Masonic ritual, and Dravot's reputation was further cemented when he showed knowledge of Masonic secrets that only the oldest priest remembered.|$|E

Sara is starved, worked for long hours, sent out in all weathers, poorly dressed in outgrown and {{worn-out}} clothes, and deprived of warmth or a comfortable bed in the attic. Despite her hardships, Sara is consoled by her friends and uses her imagination to cope, pretending she is a prisoner in the Bastille or a princess disguised as a servant. Sara also continues to be kind and polite to everyone, including those who treat her badly. One day she finds a coin in the street and uses it to buy buns at a bakery, but despite being very hungry, she gives most of the buns away to a beggar girl dressed <b>in</b> <b>rags</b> who is hungrier than herself.

Later that year she also met Joseph Tuckerman, an American Unitarian who had founded the Ministry-at-Large to the Poor in Boston, Massachusetts.

40|$|Omenn {{syndrome}} {{was recently}} {{found to be}} caused by missense mutations <b>in</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 or RAG 2 gene that result in partial V(D) J recombination activity. Although the clinical hallmarks of the disease are well defined, there have been several cases with clinical findings similar to, but distinct from Omenn syndrome. The data on immune functions and RAG gene mutations of such cases are limited. We described five Japanese infants from four unrelated families, including two cases of Omenn syndrome and three cases of related disorders. Sibling cases with typical Omenn phenotype were found to be compound heterozygotes of R 396 C and L 885 R mutations <b>in</b> <b>RAG</b> 1. The former has been reported in European cases and may constitute a hot spot. The latter is a novel missense mutation. Infants with related disorders exhibited erythroderma, eosinophilia, hypogammaglobulinaemia, decreased number of B cells and skewing to Th 2, and their lymph node specimens showed architectural effacement, lymphocyte depletion and histiocytic hyperplasia, each of which is seen characteristically in Omenn syndrome. However, in these cases serum IgE levels were low or undetectable. We found no mutation <b>in</b> <b>RAG</b> genes except for a K 820 R substitution <b>in</b> <b>RAG</b> 1, which was regarded to be a functional polymorphism, in two of these cases. Our study suggests that RAG missense mutation may be a genetic abnormality unique to Omenn syndrome with characteristic clinical and laboratory findings. Variations of Omenn syndrome, or related disorders, may represent a different type of immunodeficiency, distinct from abnormalities in lymphoid-specific recombinase activity...|$|R
