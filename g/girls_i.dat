5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young <b>girls,</b> <b>I</b> {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E

[...] Additionally, she found playing the Capricorn girl, a teenager, very tough, saying: [...] "To play a 15-year-old girl without make-up or special effects to make me look younger was the most challenging role for me. I had to look fifteen years old just through my body language. I didn't want any of the twelve girls to be caricatures." [...] Chopra also read Linda Goodman's Sun Signs and Love Signs to prepare for the parts. Initially, it was planned to film one character at a time, however, that did not happen.|$|E

500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young <b>girls.</b> <b>I</b> think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E
