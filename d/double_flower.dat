25|$|Double-flower forms often {{arise when}} {{some or all}} of the stamens in a flower are {{replaced}} by petals. These types of mutations, where one organ in a developing organism is replaced with another, are known as homeotic mutations. They are usually recessive, although the <b>double</b> <b>flower</b> mutation in carnations exhibits incomplete dominance.|$|E
25|$|In 1805, {{several new}} species were {{reported}} with red, purple, lilac, and pale yellow coloring, {{and the first}} true <b>double</b> <b>flower</b> was produced in Belgium. One {{of the more popular}} concepts of dahlia history, and the basis for many different interpretations and confusion, is that all the original discoveries were single flowered types, which, through hybridization and selective breeding, produced double forms.|$|E
25|$|The first mutant in A. thaliana was {{documented}} in 1873 by Alexander Braun, describing a <b>double</b> <b>flower</b> phenotype (the mutated gene was likely Agamous, cloned and characterized in 1990). However, not until 1943 did Friedrich Laibach (who had published the chromosome number in 1907) propose A. thaliana {{as a model}} organism. His student, Erna Reinholz, published her thesis on A. thaliana in 1945, describing the first collection of A. thaliana mutants that they generated using X-ray mutagenesis. Laibach continued his important contributions to A. thaliana research by collecting {{a large number of}} accessions (often questionably referred to as 'ecotypes'). With the help of Albert Kranz, these were organised into a large collection of 750 natural accessions of A. thaliana from around the world.|$|E
