5|$|<b>Fiduciary</b> {{funds are}} used to account for assets held in trust by the {{government}} for the benefit of individuals or other entities. The employee pension fund, created by the State of Maryland to provide retirement benefits for its employees, {{is an example of a}} <b>fiduciary</b> fund.

5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and {{the velocity of}} money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or <b>fiduciary</b> media—suggesting that the volume of <b>fiduciary</b> media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered <b>fiduciary</b> media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.|$|E
5|$|The {{accounting}} basis {{applied to}} <b>fiduciary</b> funds {{depends upon the}} needs of a specific fund.

5|$|Emperors of the Antonine and Severan dynasties overall debased the currency, {{particularly}} the denarius, under {{the pressures of}} meeting military payrolls. Sudden inflation {{during the reign of}} Commodus damaged the credit market. In the mid-200s, the supply of specie contracted sharply. Conditions during the Crisis of the Third Century—such as reductions in long-distance trade, disruption of mining operations, and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemies—greatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector by the year 300. Although Roman coinage had long been fiat money or <b>fiduciary</b> currency, general economic anxieties came to a head under Aurelian, and bankers lost confidence in coins legitimately issued by the central government. Despite Diocletian's introduction of the gold solidus and monetary reforms, the credit market of the Empire never recovered its former robustness.|$|E

In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and <b>fiduciary</b> duty, and other claims.

5|$|The tribe then {{appealed the}} case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appellate court found that various federal laws {{required}} the DOI and BIA to maintain historic buildings and to maintain Indian trust properties, but that they did not authorize monetary damages. The court then looked to the 1960 act and determined that this act did create a trust relationship that could be enforced with monetary damages. This was based on common law, with the court referencing the Restatement (Second) of Trusts to outline that a trust requires a trustee (the United States), a beneficiary (the tribe), and a trust body (the land and buildings). The court noted that both parties agreed that there was a trust, but not that damages were authorized. The court held that where the United States had control over the use and maintenance of the buildings to the exclusion of the tribe, a <b>fiduciary</b> duty was created that authorized the tribe to seek monetary damages. The court then reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court. The United States appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E
25|$|A <b>fiduciary</b> {{must not}} {{profit from the}} <b>fiduciary</b> position.

If the principal provides fully informed consent, then the <b>fiduciary</b> may keep the benefit and be absolved of any liability for what would be a breach of <b>fiduciary</b> duty. If this requirement is not met then the property is deemed by the court to be held by the <b>fiduciary</b> on constructive trust for the principal.|$|E

25|$|Where a {{principal}} can establish both a <b>fiduciary</b> duty and {{a breach of}} that duty, through violation of the above rules, the court will find that the benefit gained by the <b>fiduciary</b> {{should be returned to}} the principal because it would be unconscionable to allow the <b>fiduciary</b> to retain the benefit by employing his strict common law legal rights.

25|$|Bribes were {{initially}} considered {{not to be}} held on constructive trust, but {{were considered to be}} held as a debt by the <b>fiduciary</b> to the principal.

The change is due to pragmatic reasons, especially in regard to a bankrupt <b>fiduciary.</b> If a <b>fiduciary</b> takes a bribe and that bribe is considered a debt then if the <b>fiduciary</b> goes bankrupt the debt will be left in his pool of assets to be paid to creditors and the principal may miss out on recovery because other creditors were more secured. If the bribe is treated as held on a constructive trust then it will remain in the possession of the <b>fiduciary,</b> despite bankruptcy, until such time as the principal recovers it.|$|E

40|$|Why, {{when and}} how should control {{transactions}} be policed ex post and by a judiciary? This article {{is the first to}} 1) articulate the doctrinal prerequisites for effective ex post judicial policing of <b>fiduciaries</b> in control transactions, and 2) theoretically unify two seemingly distinct approaches to police control transactions: the ex post judicial policing in the United States and the ex ante policing by the Takeover Panel in the United Kingdom. Shareholder collective action and asymmetric information problems, and the extent of gatekeeping by <b>fiduciaries</b> together determine the mode of third-party interventions, such as those by judiciaries and the Takeover Panel, in control transactions. The Article’s analysis yields normative conclusions about how judiciaries in the United States, including Delaware’s, should fine-tune gatekeeping by corporate <b>fiduciaries</b> in control transactions. It predicts that multijurisdictional shareholder litigation that seeks anticipatory adjudication will produce negative consequences. Further, it gives policy makers outside of the United States the theoretical foundation for crafting third-party interventions in both types of control transactions, i. e., third-party acquisitions of control and controller freeze-outs, that are optimal for their own jurisdictions...|$|R
