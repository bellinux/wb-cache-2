5000|$|The {{magnetic}} moment has a close connection with angular momentum called the <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>effect.</b> This effect is expressed on a macroscopic {{scale in the}} Einstein-de Haas effect, or [...] "rotation by magnetization," [...] and its inverse, the Barnett effect, or [...] "magnetization by rotation." [...] In particular, when a {{magnetic moment}} is subject to a torque in a magnetic field that tends to align it with the applied magnetic field, the moment precesses (rotates about the axis of the applied field). This {{is a consequence of}} the concomitance of magnetic moment and angular momentum, that in case of charged massive particles corresponds to the concomitance of charge and mass in a particle.|$|E

The measured cw NMR spectra, reflecting the order-parameter structure, respond very differently to rotation in opposite directions. The sign of this asymmetry is not linked to {{the direction of the}} applied magnetic field, as expected for a <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>effect,</b> but varies randomly from one cooldown to another.

40|$|AbstractA {{modified}} Gilbert equation for micromagnetics is considered, {{obtained by}} augmenting the standard viscous-like dissipation with a rate-independent term. We prove {{existence of a}} weak solution both with and without viscous dissipation. By scaling time we show that, if the applied field varies very slowly, then <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>effects</b> and viscous dissipation become negligible. In the infinitesimally-slow-loading limit, the system thus becomes fully rate-independent...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Microwave devices as {{circulators}} or tunable filters demand nowadays {{small size}} and broad bandwidth. Ferromagnetic nanowired membranes are ideal candidates for this purpose. This paper {{focuses on the}} dielectric properties of such substrates, as influenced by the ferromagnetic nature of nanowires and their filling factor. Two particular cases are considered: a membrane filled up to its top with nanowires, forming a one-layer substrate, and a membrane filled {{up to a certain}} percentage of its height with nanowires, forming a two-layer substrate. The models proposed in this paper for each case take the inductive and <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>effects</b> in the wires into account. They predict for the one-layer case a magnetodielectric behavior which is tunable by applying an external magnetic field. The effect is no longer visible for the two-layer topology corresponding to microwave circuit applications...|$|R

40|$|Rotating {{superfluid}} 3 He-B {{is found}} to possess a new contribution to the NMR frequency shift, which changes sign on reversal of either the angular velocity of rotation or the magnetic field. For p= 29. 3 bars this <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>effect</b> shows a discontinuity in magnitude at the first-order phase-transition temperature T/Tc= 0. 6, at which {{a change in the}} vortex-core structure takes place. These observations support the conclusion that the vortex core possesses a spontaneous intrinsic magnetization. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|When a {{magnetic}} field is turned on, a superconducting body acquires an angular momentum in direction opposite to the applied field. This <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>effect</b> has been established experimentally and is understood theoretically. However, the corresponding situation when a superconductor is cooled in a pre-existent field has not been examined. We argue that the conventional theory of superconductivity {{does not provide a}} prediction for the outcome of that experiment that does not violate fundamental laws of physics, either Lenz's law or conservation of angular momentum. The theory of hole superconductivity predicts an outcome of this experiment consistent with the laws of physics. Comment: to be published in Phys. Lett. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{theoretically}} show that, despite Earnshaw's theorem, a non-rotating single {{magnetic domain}} nanoparticle can be stably levitated in an external static magnetic field. The stabilization {{relies on the}} quantum spin origin of magnetization, namely the <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>effect.</b> We predict the existence of two stable phases related to the Einstein [...] de Haas effect and the Larmor precession. At a stable point, we derive a quadratic Hamiltonian that describes the quantum fluctuations of the degrees of freedom of the system. We show that {{in the absence of}} thermal fluctuations, the quantum state of the nanomagnet at the equilibrium point contains entanglement and squeezing.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{details the}} development of two pulsed field magnetometers which allow novel measurements of particulate recording media to be performed. The samples studied are indicative of advanced metal particle recording media which are currently utilised for high density data storage applications, such as Imation Travan"T"M linear tape. In {{the first part of}} this investigation, a magnetometer has been developed to study reversal processes in metal particle dispersions. The instrument consists of a MOSFET pulse generator which produces well-defined current pulses of over 125 A, with selectable pulse widths between 25 #mu#s and 130 #mu#s. The current pulse is driven into a small field coil assembly, the geometry of which is such that a magnetic field of over 4. 7 kOe is generated, with symmetrical rise and fall times of around 15 #mu#s. Extensive proving studies are presented, which reveal that differences in chemical formulation and dispersion quality may be monitored through pulsed remanence curves. The second part of this investigation concerns the highly topical issue of high speed reversal in particulate media. A 50 #OMEGA# pressurised nitrogen spark gap switch has been developed, capable of producing well-defined single-shot voltage pulses of over 3 kV. The pulse width is adjustable from 7 ns to 56 ns, with rise times of under 3 ns. The magnetometer consists of a charged coaxial line connected through the spark gap to an improved 50 #OMEGA# microstrip structure, the geometry of which allows pulsed magnetic fields to be produced with a maximum amplitude of 1. 8 kOe. Again, extensive proving studies have been performed and the results are compared with recent models of thermally activated reversal. These pulsed field studies have revealed a correlation between the degree of particle orientation in the tape and high speed reversal properties. The origins of this effect are complex, and are related at different timescales to the crystallite or activation volume, particle interactions and phenomena influenced by <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>effects.</b> The implications of this are that larger head fields are required to write high frequency transitions on increasingly textured systems. Clearly, this promotes conflicting requirements in terms of recording performance and media durability.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{magnetic}} moments of odd-A deformed nuclei can be interpreted {{in terms of the}} independentparticle model with interconfigurational mixing due to the very-short-range residual forces. The latter are implied by using the empirically reduced spin <b>gyromagnetic</b> ratios. The <b>effects</b> of these residual forces on the collective gyromagnetic ratios g/sub R/ are discussed in terms of pair correlation. The effect of particle-rotation interaction on the magnetic moment and the collective gyromagnetic ratio are shown. The g/sub R/ values are obtained from the magnetic moments and the matrix elements for M 1 transitions in tais band. It is found that these mechanisms give a satisfactory account of the collective gyromagnetic ratio of Dy/sup 161 /, Ho /sup 165 /, Er/sup 167 /, and Hf/sup 179 /. (auth...|$|R
