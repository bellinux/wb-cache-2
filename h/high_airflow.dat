40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} automatic water sprinkler systems on the suppression of incipient and propagating conveyor belt fires under ventilated conditions. Large-scale experiments were performed at airflows ranging from 1. 1 to 4. 6 m/s. In incipient fire experiments with 10020 C, standard-response sprinklers installed above and between the belts, the sprinklers activated later, the peak heat release rates were larger, and more belting was consumed at the <b>higher</b> <b>airflow.</b> In similar experiments with 74 20 C, fast-response sprinklers, the sprinklers activated at the same heat release rate for both <b>high</b> and low <b>airflows,</b> but the peak heat release rate and amount of belting consumed was slightly higher at the lower airflow. In incipient fire experiments with sprinklers located only above the top belt, the heat release rate and amount of belting consumed was larger at the <b>higher</b> <b>airflow.</b> The propagating fire experiments showed that sprinklers located above and between the belts were effective in stopping flame propagation. Peak heat release rates and amount of belting consumed were larger at the <b>higher</b> <b>airflows</b> for both the 74 20 C, fast-response and 100 20 C, standard-response sprinklers.

40|$|For {{hazardous}} work such as asbestos abatement, {{there is a}} need to assess protective clothing fabrics and seam constructions to assure an adequate barrier against hazardous material. The penetration of aerosols through fabrics usually is measured by challenging fabric samples with an aerosol stream at a constant specified airflow. To produce the specified airflow, pressure differentials across the samples often are higher than exist in a work environment. This <b>higher</b> <b>airflow</b> results in <b>higher</b> aerosol velocities through the fabric and, possibly, measured penetration values not representative of those actually experienced in the field. The objective of the reported work was to develop a test method that does not require these <b>higher</b> <b>airflows.</b> The authors have designed and fabricated a new system that tests fabric samples under a low, constant, specified pressure differential across the samples. This differential is adjustable from tenths of a mm Water Gauge (hundredths of an in WG) to over 25 -mm WG (1 -in WG). The system operates at a pressure slightly lower than its surroundings. Although designed primarily for asbestos, the system is equally applicable to the testing of other aerosols by changing the aerosol generator and detector. Through simple modification of the sample holders, the test apparatus would be capable of evaluating seam and closure constructions...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} on {{the transmission}} characteristics of droplet phase aerosols were performed in an aircraft cabin mock-up facility at the Technical University of Denmark.

Results showed that fewer droplets were dispersed to other seats when the droplets were released at a seat next to the cabin wall compared to that at the center seats, suggesting that the downward air flow at the. side seat suppressed the dispersion of droplets while the upward air flow at the center might enhance the dispersion. <b>Higher</b> supply <b>airflow</b> rate and lower relative humidity (RH) reduced the dispersion of droplets.

30|$|Computer and {{telecommunication}} {{facilities in}} that era were moving from electro-mechanical equipment to solid-state electronics. Increasing equipment densities and power consumption were leading to <b>higher</b> <b>airflows</b> being needed for cooling. Len Gibson and John Petersen at the Australian Post-Master Generals’ Department (PMG) were finding that ceiling mounted smoke detectors were failing to detect fires early enough, particularly smouldering fires, before significant damage occurred to more sensitive electronic equipment. Often this led to serious service interruptions and major business and community impacts. Longer-term, insidious damage was often caused by corrosion from the HCl vapours being emitted from overheated PVC cable insulation.|$|R
50|$|The {{first real}} {{production}} model was the Orenda 8, {{which was the}} powerplant of the CF-100 Mk.3. This model was first flown in September 1952 and entered service in 1953.

The Orenda 11 demanded <b>higher</b> <b>airflow</b> through the engine, and featured a second turbine stage to power the more powerful compressor.

50|$|The Wells turbine, {{designed}} in the late 1970s by professor Alan Arthur Wells at Queen's University Belfast, is a bidirectional turbine that uses symmetrical airfoils (see Fig. 1). The airfoils will spin the same direction regardless of the direction of airflow. The Wells turbine has both benefits and drawbacks. It has no moving parts other than the main turbine rotor, {{making it easier to}} maintain and more cost effective. However, it sacrifices some efficiency at <b>high</b> <b>airflow</b> rates because the airfoil's high angle of attack creates more drag. The angle of attack is the number of degrees the airfoil is from being parallel with the airflow. Wells turbines are most efficient at low speed airflows.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine control}} unit (ECU) allows vacuum into the {{actuator}} by powering a solenoid valve when the engine rotation speed is low. At higher engine speeds (e.g. 4,200 rpm), vacuum is cut off and a spring inside the actuator causes the butterfly valve to fully open. The idea behind the system {{is that in the}} lower engine speed band, the speed of the intake air will be increased because the intake runner cross section per cylinder is smaller. However, when engine speed increases, the second runner is opened, decreasing airflow speed, but increasing the airflow volume, better matching the engine's airflow needs at higher revolutions. With modified engines it may be desirable to have the T-VIS open earlier than stock, because modifications that improve an engine's power output may do so by increasing airflow per engine revolution, resulting in a <b>high</b> <b>airflow</b> at a lower rpm.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} {{primary cause}} for the accident was a gross structural failure of the aircraft's main spar, which was confirmed by amateur footage, photographs and eyewitness accounts. The reason for the failure was not determined by the Board of Inquiry (BoI), but it was suggested by an accident investigator called in by Rolls Royce that the main cause was that the pilot, upon performing the planned aerobatic display, exceeded the prototype's briefed speed and turning rate limits.The accident investigator submitted {{a statement to the}} BoI, but did not give evidence under oath. The BoI was apparently not informed that the aircraft manufacturer considered the basis for the statement to be invalid.The Technical Officer of the Board of Inquiry (BoI) identified a suspected fatigue failure of the inboard arm of the front bottom wing attachment main forging, and suggested vibration from the <b>high</b> <b>airflow</b> volumes required by the RR Conway 11 engines as a possible cause.The Royal Aircraft Establishment carried out a structural analysis of the wreckage and produced a report on 21 April 1960, but no copy has been found in the public record.Tony Blackman argues that the maintenance crew failed to properly inspect the aircraft for known issues with stress damage to the aircraft's leading edges and structural ribs, which had been observed in another prototype he had flown earlier.|$|E

40|$|Assumptions of {{productivity}} {{costs related to}} the outdoor supply airflow rate and indoor temperature can be made based {{on a number of}} recent studies. A life cycle cost (LCC) computer program for indoor climate systems based on Swedish conditions was developed and used to compare and optimize different indoor climate systems. A productivity cost related to the outdoor supply airflow rate and the indoor temperature according to the recent studies was assumed. A <b>higher</b> outdoor supply <b>airflow</b> rate, as well as a more correct indoor temperature, increases the energy use and in some cases the designed maximum power and thereby the initial cost of the indoor climate system, which includes the heating, ventilation and cooling systems.

50|$|An {{oil bath}} air cleaner {{consists}} of a sump containing a pool of oil, and an insert which is filled with fibre, mesh, foam, or another coarse filter media. When the cleaner is assembled, the media-containing body of the insert sits a short distance above {{the surface of the}} oil pool. The rim of the insert overlaps the rim of the sump. This arrangement forms a labyrinthine path through which the air must travel in a series of U-turns: up through the gap between the rims of the insert and the sump, down through the gap between the outer wall of the insert and the inner wall of the sump, and up through the filter media {{in the body of the}} insert. This U-turn takes the air at high velocity across the surface of the oil pool. Larger and heavier dust and dirt particles in the air cannot make the turn due to their inertia, so they fall into the oil and settle to the bottom of the base bowl. Lighter and smaller particles are trapped by the filtration media in the insert, which is wetted by oil droplets aspirated there into by normal airflow. Oil bath air cleaners were very widely used in automotive and small engine applications until the widespread industry adoption of the paper filter in the early 1960s. Such cleaners are still used in off-road equipment where very high levels of dust are encountered, for oil bath air cleaners can sequester a great deal of dirt relative to their overall size without loss of filtration efficiency or airflow. However, the liquid oil makes cleaning and servicing such air cleaners messy and inconvenient, they must be relatively large to avoid excessive restriction at <b>high</b> <b>airflow</b> rates, and they tend to increase exhaust emissions of unburned hydrocarbons due to oil aspiration when used on spark-ignition engines.|$|E

The project began by studying the EM 7 ´s structure and function by working on itsassembly line. A short literature study on the subject Design for Manufacturing wasalso done. By working {{on the assembly line}} and by speaking with staff from production anddevelopment departments, a number of ideas for reducing manufacturing costs arose. Estimations of the potential cost reduction size for each proposal were done incollaboration with vendors and the purchasing department. Based {{on the size of the}} cost reduction, technical risk, impact on the assembly lineand the development time the various proposals were ranked. The two highestranked proposals were selected for further development towards finished solutions. One of the ideas that were selected to develop in to a finished solution meant thatsome of the pneumatic valves were replaced with others. Most of the mechanicalfeatures on the EM 7 are operated by pneumatic cylinders, and they are controlled bythe valves. The valves in use today have very fast switching times which makes themrelatively expensive. By replacing the valves with valves that have <b>higher</b> <b>airflow</b> butlonger switch times, costs are reduced through a lower purchase price of the valves. Thanks to the <b>higher</b> <b>airflow</b> this can be done without affecting the EM 7 ´sperformance. The second proposal was selected because it reduces assembly time.
