5|$|Dantidurga's {{successor}} Krishna I brought major {{portions of}} present-day Karnataka and Konkan under <b>his</b> <b>control.</b> During {{the rule of}} Dhruva Dharavarsha who took control in 780, the kingdom expanded into an empire that encompassed all of the territory between the Kaveri River and Central India. He led successful expeditions to Kannauj, the seat of northern Indian power where he defeated the Gurjara Pratiharas and the Palas of Bengal, gaining him fame and vast booty but not more territory. He also brought the Eastern Chalukyas and Gangas of Talakad under <b>his</b> <b>control.</b> According to Altekar and Sen, the Rashtrakutas became a pan-India power during his rule.|$|E
5|$|Despite the coup's {{failure and}} his death, Abdallah {{had been able}} to {{consolidate}} <b>his</b> <b>control</b> over Mosul, becoming the virtual founder of a Hamdanid-ruled emirate there. During his long absences in Baghdad in his final years, Abdallah relegated authority over Mosul to his eldest son, al-Hasan, the future Nasir al-Dawla. After Abdallah's death, Hasan's position in Mosul was challenged by his uncles, and it was not until 935 {{that he was able to}} secure confirmation by Baghdad of <b>his</b> <b>control</b> over Mosul and the entire Jazira up to the Byzantine frontier.|$|E

By 2008, Potter retained less than 10% of the vote for corporate decision making and was no longer involved in operations.|$|E
5|$|The pilots felt a jolt, and the {{autopilot}} disengaged. As Records {{took hold of}} <b>his</b> <b>control</b> column, Haynes focused on the tail engine, whose instruments indicated it was malfunctioning; he found its throttle and fuel supply controls jammed. At Dvorak's suggestion, a valve cutting fuel to the tail engine was shut off. This part of the emergency took 14 seconds.|$|E

Reuther then became a willing partner in the merger negotiations.|$|E
5|$|A {{veteran of}} the Spanish–American War, Neuer worked as a {{brakeman}} before taking up baseball professionally. He played for various minor league teams in 1905 and 1907 before making his debut for the New York Highlanders. With New York, he threw three shutouts in seven games, and was praised by manager Clark Griffith for his pitching ability during that stretch. However, <b>his</b> <b>control</b> deteriorated after that season, {{and over the next}} three years he played for various minor league teams. He retired after 1910 and became an umpire. He then worked at Bendix Aviation until his retirement in 1942.|$|E

5|$|Abu al-Dhahab's {{withdrawal}} frustrated Zahir who {{proceeded to}} make independent moves, first by capturing Jaffa in August 1771, after driving out its governor Ahmad Bey Tuqan, and shortly thereafter, capturing the cotton-producing Bani Sa'b region (centered around modern-day Tulkarm), {{which was held}} by Mustafa Bey Tuqan. Zahir had Jaffa fortified and stationed 2,000 troops there. By the end of August, Zahir remained in control of Jaffa, while Uthman Pasha had restored <b>his</b> <b>control</b> over Ramla and Gaza.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to their}} homeland, but only because he was so confident of <b>his</b> <b>control</b> and that no one was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.|$|E
5|$|Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana {{became an}} {{independent}} king upon his father's death in 1710 {{and the consequent}} partition of the Kingdom of Imerina, from which he received the eastern quadrant of Avaradrano, the largest piece. He established his capital at the village of Ambohimanga; the cultural and historical significance of this site was recognized by UNESCO in 2001 when it was declared Madagascar's first cultural World Heritage Site. Throughout his reign as King of Avaradrano (1710–1730), Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana fought to strengthen the authority of his governance at Ambohimanga and attract residents to settle in the surrounding villages while battling his brothers to increase the land under <b>his</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

5|$|As Vizier he {{had taken}} all powers under <b>his</b> <b>control</b> as the king was only a puppet, a figurehead, who was into enjoying life with wine, opium and women. But he {{overestimated}} and over exercised his powers {{with the result that}} the Emperor’s family called their Hindu Maratha confederacy to help them get rid of their Vizier. A civil strife ensued and eventually in 1753 Safdarjung was driven out of Delhi. He died soon thereafter in 1754. After his death his son Nawab Shujaud Daula pleaded with the Mughal Emperor to permit him to erect a tomb for his father in Delhi. He then built the tomb, which was designed by an Abyssininan architect.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the old Conservative {{government}} Cave left office on 23 January 1924. He was replaced by Lord Haldane, who was serving for a second time and was sworn in on 25 January. Haldane was in favour of the creation of a Ministry of Justice, and although Schuster was privately against it he suggested that he would have accepted the responsibilities of such a Ministry on the condition that it remained under <b>his</b> <b>control</b> as the Lord Chancellor's Office was. Haldane was ill, however, and the Labour government lasted only ten months thanks to the publishing of the Zinoviev Letter, and no large-scale reforms such as the creation of a Ministry of Justice were ever pushed through.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Andriamasinavalona's reign, the {{highlands}} around Imerina were wracked with violent conflict among minor princedoms centered around fortified hill towns. Andriamasinavalona successfully united {{a number of these}} principalities in the territory bordering his own, thereby expanding the boundaries of Imerina to include Fanongoavana to the west, Rangaina to the north, Ombifotsy to the east and Sahasarotra to the south. As he brought each territory under <b>his</b> <b>control,</b> he restricted the autonomy of its original rulers and imposed strict submission to his own authority. His diplomatic and political conquests enabled Andriamasinavalona to extend his kingdom to its fullest historical extent, making him the first Merina sovereign to rule over the entire province of Imerina.|$|E
50|$|On 30 May 2014, Ghirardi {{announced}} he would resign as chairman of Parma F.C. and sell his stake in the club. He eventually sold <b>his</b> <b>controlling</b> holding to Cypriot-Russian company Dastraso Holding Limited in December 2014.|$|R

5|$|At this point, the Greeks of Laconia and Arcadia, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of a certain Michael, tried to stop the Franks at the olive grove of Kountouras in northeastern Messenia. Modern scholars have traditionally identified this Michael with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, founder of the Despotate of Epirus, but this identification has been questioned more recently by Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, as the fragile nature of <b>his</b> <b>control</b> over Epirus would have made a departure to aid the Moreote Greeks a major and unlikely gamble.|$|E
5|$|Between 911 and 919, Edward {{expanded}} <b>his</b> <b>control</b> {{over the}} rest of England south of the Humber, establishing in Essex and Mercia burhs, often designed to control the use of a river by the Danes. In 917, the Danish position in the area suddenly collapsed. A rapid succession of defeats culminated in the loss of the territories of Northampton and Huntingdon, along with the remainder of Essex: a Danish king, probably from East Anglia, was killed at Tempsford. Despite reinforcement from overseas, the Danish counter-attacks were crushed, and following the defection of many of their English subjects as Edward's army advanced, the Danes of East Anglia and Cambridge both capitulated.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{explored}} coaching possibilities, {{but he was}} mindful not to {{put himself}} {{in a position where}} <b>his</b> <b>control</b> might be challenged as it had been in Cleveland. In the mid-1960s, the American Football League (AFL), which had formed to compete against the NFL, put a new franchise in Cincinnati. Brown was the third-largest investor in the team and was given the title of coach and general manager. He was also given the right to represent the team in all league matters, a key element of control for Brown.|$|E
