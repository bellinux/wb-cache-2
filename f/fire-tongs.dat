The black beetles did frighten me a little, {{but there was always}} the dear old cat; and sometimes, when mother and the girls were out, papa would call softly down the kitchen stairs for me to come up, and we would have such a merry evening together, and sup off sausages: dear old dad, I hardly ever see him now. And then, when my work was done, how pleasant it was to sit in front of the fire, and dream of the wonderful things that would come to me some day. I was {{always going to be a}} Princess, even in my dreams, and live in a palace, but it was so different to this. Oh, how I hate it, this beastly palace where everybody sneers at me--I know they do, though they bow and scrape, and pretend to be so polite. And I'm not clever and smart as they are. I hate them. I hate these bold-faced women who are always here. That is the worst of a palace, everybody can come in. Oh, I hate everybody and everything. Oh, god-mamma, god-mamma, come and take me away. Take me back to my old kitchen. Give me back my old poor frock. Let me dance again with the <b>fire-tongs</b> for a partner, and be happy, dreaming." ...|$|E

5000|$|... (The <b>Fire-Tongs</b> Bowl or The Punch Bowl) is a 1944 German film, {{directed}} by Helmut Weiss {{and is based}} on the book of the same name. It follows the book closely as its author, Heinrich Spoerl, also wrote the script for the film. Both tell the story of a famous writer going undercover as a student at a small town secondary school after his friends tell him that he missed out on the best part of growing up by being educated at home. The story in the book takes place {{during the time of the}} Wilhelmine Empire in Germany. The movie was produced and released in Germany during the last years of World War II and has been called a [...] "masterpiece of timeless, cheerful escapism." [...] The movie stars Heinz Rühmann in the role of the student Hans Pfeiffer, which is remarkable as Rühmann was already 42 years old at that time. The title comes from the German alcoholic tradition of Feuerzangenbowle.|$|E
