5|$|Enzymes are {{generally}} globular proteins, acting {{alone or in}} larger complexes. The sequence of the amino acids specifies the structure which in turn determines the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Although structure determines function, a novel enzymatic activity cannot yet be predicted from structure alone. Enzyme structures unfold (denature) when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity. Enzyme denaturation is normally linked to temperatures above a species' normal level; as a result, enzymes from bacteria living in volcanic environments such as hot springs are prized by <b>industrial</b> <b>users</b> {{for their ability to}} function at high temperatures, allowing enzyme-catalysed reactions to be operated at a very high rate.|$|E
5|$|The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 {{effectively}} made possession or {{transfer of}} marihuana illegal throughout the United States under federal law, excluding medical and industrial uses, through imposition of an excise tax on all sales of hemp. Annual fees were $24 ($637 adjusted for inflation) for importers, manufacturers, and cultivators of cannabis, $1 ($24 adjusted for inflation) for medical and research purposes, and $3 ($82 adjusted for inflation) for <b>industrial</b> <b>users.</b> Detailed sales logs {{were required to}} record marihuana sales. Selling marihuana to any person who had previously paid the annual fee incurred a tax of $1 per ounce or fraction thereof; however, the tax was $100 ($2,206 adjusted for inflation) per ounce or fraction thereof to sell any person who had not registered and paid the annual fee.|$|E

25|$|Water {{and sewer}} tariffs in Jordan are {{differentiated}} by geographic area, {{type of use}} and volume of use. In areas served by public companies - the governorates of Amman, Aqaba, Irbid, Jerash, Ajloun and Mafraq - tariffs are {{higher than in the}} rest of the country where services are provided by WAJ. Residential water and sewer tariffs use an increasing-block system, under which users pay a higher tariff per m3 if they consume more water. The first block, corresponding to a consumption of 18m3 per quarter, is a minimum charge independent of the amount of water consumed. Water and sewer tariffs for non-residential use (commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>users)</b> are about ten to twenty times higher respectively than residential water and sewer tariffs in the lowest consumption block.|$|E
25|$|Since 1980, China's energy {{production}} has grown dramatically, {{as has the}} proportion allocated to domestic consumption. Some 80 percent of all power is generated from fossil fuel at thermal plants, with about 17 percent at hydroelectric installations; only about two percent is from nuclear energy, mainly from plants located in Guangdong and Zhejiang. Though China has rich overall energy potential, most {{have yet to be}} developed. In addition, the geographical distribution of energy puts most of these resources relatively far from their major <b>industrial</b> <b>users.</b> Basically the northeast is rich in coal and oil, the central part of north China has abundant coal, and the southwest has immense hydroelectric potential. But the industrialized regions around Guangzhou and the Lower Yangtze region around Shanghai have too little energy, while there is relatively little heavy industry located near major energy resource areas other than {{in the southern part of}} the northeast.|$|E

40|$|A {{marketing}} organization’s distribution {{capability is}} an important determinant of its success. A product cannot reach its target market if distribution is not planned and executed carefully. Producers often involve the services of middlemen in bringing their products to markets. The producer, the intermediary (or intermediaries) and the consumer or <b>industrial</b> <b>user</b> constitutes the marketing channel for the product. A marketing channel (channel of distribution) is the series of marketing institutions that facilitates transfer of title to a product as it moves from producer to ultimate consumer or <b>industrial</b> <b>user.</b> Producers, middlemen and final buyers are participants in a channel (channel members). A middlemen (marketing intermediary or reseller) is a person or firm, such as a wholesaler, that operates between the producer and the final buyer of a product. Middlemen specialize in buying and selling, but also perform other marketing functions such as risk taking, assembling, financing, storage, transportation, marketing research, and promotion. All channels have a producer and an ultimate consumer/user. But when a producer sells directly to the final buyer, there are no middlemen in the channel. The producer and/or buyer must perform these functions. Marketing channels create utility, improve exchange efficiency and help {{in the process of}} matching demand and supply.
