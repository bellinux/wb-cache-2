5|$|Although {{the main}} story ends here, the {{introduction}} of the Broken Steel DLC creates a new choice with the ending, in that the Lone Wanderer can send one of their radiation-immune companions <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> to input the code. Furthermore, the game remains open-ended from this point onwards, with the Wanderer surviving the radiation they were subjected to, and recovering two weeks later to the news that the purifier is working well and supplying clean water {{to the people of the}} waste, or has been having an adverse effect on life thanks to {{the introduction of}} the modified FEV. Sarah Lyons does not survive if sent <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> in the Broken Steel ending.|$|E
5|$|The {{small size}} and {{independence}} of the laser modules allowed the huge NIF building to be dispensed with. Instead, the modules were arranged in groups surrounding the target chamber in a compact arrangement. In baseline designs, the modules were stacked in 2-wide by 8-high groups in two rings {{above and below the}} target chamber, shining their light through small holes drilled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> to protect them from the neutron flux coming back out.|$|E

5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior. Another case {{was described by}} Walters and Card (1996) in which a female was found {{at the entrance of}} a chamber with seven neonates crawling on or around her. When one of the young was moved a short distance from the chamber, she seemed to be agitated and faced the intruder. Eventually, all of her offspring retreated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{also revealed}} evidence for modern activity around the site. Three post-medieval pits {{were identified in}} and around the barrow, as well as a post-medieval attempt to dig <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber.</b> Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated from between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, stone and clay marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated from between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts that it had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that it came {{to be used as a}} well-known rabbit warren in the local area.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, the Nazis {{decided to}} {{increase}} greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, {{which had been}} designed as a mortuary with morgues {{in the basement and}} ground-level incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the Zyklon B (a highly lethal cyanide-based pesticide) to be dropped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter. It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed using these four structures.|$|E
50|$|The siphuncle of Oonoceras is cyrtochoanitic. Septal necks flare {{outwardly}} {{and unlike}} Oocerina, are empty. Segments are either slightly or broadly expanded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{shell of}} Baeopleuroceras is a short, rapidly {{expanding}} cyrtocone, curved {{through at least}} 90 degrees. <b>The</b> body <b>chamber</b> is one half the overall shell length. The siphuncle is subcentral with segments slightly expanded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{convince}} Congress to keep the capital in Philadelphia, the city began construction on a massive new Presidential palace on 9th Street {{as well as an}} expansion to the County Courthouse into what would become Congress Hall. Upon the return of Congress to Philadelphia on December 6, 1790, the first level of Congress Hall had been transformed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> for the House of Representatives and the second floor had been converted into a chamber for the United States Senate. Despite their efforts to construct new buildings for use by the federal government, the city's residents failed to convince Congress to modify the Residence Act and make Philadelphia the permanent capital. Congress Hall served as the capitol building until May 14, 1800, when the offices of the national government moved to Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for Harry and Ron, Hagrid left {{a set of}} {{instructions:}} {{to follow}} the spiders currently fleeing into the Forbidden Forest, which they do, {{only to find the}} monster blamed for the attacks fifty years before, a massive spider named Aragog, who explains to the duo that the real monster is one that spiders fear above all others. Hermione provides the last set of clues that inform them of the monster’s identity: It is a basilisk, (hence Harry’s ability to understand it,) that kills with a stare (although no one is dead because of various devices through which they indirectly saw the monster) and which spiders (such as Aragog and his offspring) fear above all others. Harry figures out from hints Aragog dropped that a student who died during the previous attacks is Myrtle, and when Ginny is apparently taken by the monster <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chamber,</b> they discover that the entrance is in the bathroom they’ve been using to make Polyjuice Potion. Harry, Ron, and Lockhart enter the Chamber, but the dunderheaded professor (who reveals that he’s a fraud) causes a rockfall upon attempt to modify the boys’ memories with Ron’s damaged wand, and Harry must enter alone. He arrives to find Ginny in a weakened state being watched over by a shadowy, ghostly Riddle, who explains that he is not only the heir of Slytherin, but also grew up to become Voldemort himself, before setting the basilisk upon Harry; Harry defeats the monster, with the help of Dumbledore's Phoenix, and the Sword of Gryffindor drawn from the Sorting Hat, and destroys the diary, which makes Riddle disappear.|$|E
25|$|A tobacco pipe {{typically}} {{consists of}} a small chamber (the bowl) for the combustion of the tobacco to be smoked and a thin stem (shank) that ends in a mouthpiece (the bit). Shredded pieces of tobacco are placed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> and ignited.|$|E
50|$|Cross Track Sensor (CTS): The {{cross track}} sensor is a hollow {{hemispherical}} dome {{divided into four}} independent chambers with a miniaturized Bayard-Alpert hot filament ionization gauge in each chamber. Four small holes in the dome allow the neutral gas to stream <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chambers.</b> <b>The</b> pressure in any chamber {{will depend on the}} arrival angle of the neutral wind.|$|R

25|$|The {{measured}} {{amounts of}} water and semolina are mixed together in pre-mixer to form a crumbly dough. The traditional type of pre-mixer is a trough with a cylindrical section inside which rotates a mixing shaft with blades. More advanced systems use a high-speed (centrifuge) pre-mixer in which water and semolina are sprayed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> so that each particle of semolina absorbs the correct amount of water.|$|E
25|$|On 28 August 1984, when Elisabeth was 18 {{years of}} age, her father lured {{her into the}} {{basement}} of the family home, saying he needed help carrying a door. This was the last piece needed to seal the chamber. Elisabeth held it in place while Josef fitted it into the frame. Then he held an ether-soaked towel on Elisabeth's face until she was unconscious, and threw her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
25|$|The main chamber {{also carries}} the {{symbolic}} element, a mihrab design over the central marble lattice or jaali, facing Mecca in the West, here {{instead of the}} traditional Surah 24, An-Noor of Quran which is inscribed on the mihrabs, this one is just an outline allowing light to enter directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> from Qibla or the direction of Mecca, thus elevating {{the status of the}} Emperor, above his rivals and closer to divinity.|$|E
40|$|We {{experienced}} {{two cases}} of the influx of the sclerotomy site bleeding <b>into</b> <b>the</b> anterior <b>chamber</b> during 23 -gauge sutureless vitrectomy for pseudophakic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Soon after the removal of a 23 -gauge microcannula {{at the end of}} the surgery, presumed sclerotomy site hemorrhage was rapidly fluxed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> anterior <b>chamber.</b> <b>The</b> anterior <b>chamber</b> bleeding might come from the sclerotomies rather than from episcleral vessels. The posterior pressure in the gas-filled pseudophakic eye might have pushed the sclerotomy site bleeding <b>into</b> <b>the</b> anterior <b>chamber.</b> We could not find any vitreous hemorrhages. The hemorrhage within <b>the</b> anterior <b>chamber</b> spontaneously absorbed within 14 days...|$|R
40|$|The {{parts of}} a {{chemical}} vapor deposition (CVD) reactor were examined extensively to create a procedure for placing a metal wafer <b>into</b> <b>the</b> loading <b>chamber,</b> transferring it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> reaction <b>chamber,</b> returning it to <b>the</b> loading <b>chamber,</b> then taking it back out. The instructions were created to learn about vacuum technology...|$|R
5000|$|The {{shell of}} Landeroceras is a subcylindrical brevicone with the siphuncle on one side, {{determined}} as ventral. Siphuncle segments are short and well expanded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chambers.</b> Connecting rings are thick, septal necks cyrochoanitic to recumbent, bullettes markedly swollen.|$|R
25|$|The {{demand valve}} has a chamber, which in normal use {{contains}} breathing gas at ambient pressure. A valve which supplies medium pressure gas can vent <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber.</b> Either a mouthpiece or a full-face mask {{is connected to}} the chamber for the diver to breathe from. The mouthpiece can be direct coupled or connected by a flexible low-pressure hose. On one side of the chamber is a flexible diaphragm to control the operation of the valve. The diaphragm is protected by a cover with holes or slits through which outside water can enter freely.|$|E
25|$|Mozart {{introduced}} the newly invented clarinet <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> music arsenal, with the Kegelstatt Trio for viola, clarinet and piano, K. 498, and the Quintet for Clarinet and String Quartet, K. 581. He also tried other innovative ensembles, including the quintet for violin, two violas, cello, and horn, K. 407, quartets for flute and strings, and various wind instrument combinations. He wrote six string quintets for two violins, two violas and cello, which explore the rich tenor {{tones of the}} violas, adding {{a new dimension to}} the string quartet conversation.|$|E
25|$|At {{the loading}} area, guests board the troop transport. Through the radio, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) reminds the {{tourists}} to fasten their seat belts, {{and points out}} {{a problem with the}} transport. The transport takes off, past a cluster of mirrors concealing the maintenance dock entrance, and turns a corner <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Destiny, where guests are presented with three doors. One of the three doors begins to glow more brightly than the other two, and Mara announces which gift the passengers have chosen to receive. The doors open, and the passengers enter the Hall of Promise.|$|E
5000|$|In early {{forms the}} siphuncle is central or subcentral, orthochoanitic (septal necks short and straight), and thin, with tubular {{segments}}. Later forms include those with cyrochoanitic septal necks (curved outward) and segments {{that may be}} slightly to strongly expanded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{ciliary body}} is a {{ring-shaped}} thickening of tissue inside the eye that divides <b>the</b> posterior <b>chamber</b> from <b>the</b> vitreous body. It contains the ciliary muscle, vessels, and fibrous connective tissue. Folds on the inner ciliary epithelium are called ciliary processes, and these secrete aqueous humor <b>into</b> <b>the</b> posterior <b>chamber.</b> <b>The</b> aqueous humor then flows through <b>the</b> pupil <b>into</b> <b>the</b> anterior <b>chamber.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kadaroceras is a genus of discosorids {{from the}} Devonian, named by Zhuravleva, 1972, {{possibly}} {{a member of}} the Discosoridae. Discosorids are nautiloid cephalopods generally characterized by inflated siphuncle segments that expand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chambers</b> and by connecting rings that vary in composition along their length.|$|R
25|$|The {{transport}} then {{approaches a}} dark area and stops. Indiana Jones suddenly appears above the vehicle {{hanging on a}} rope in a shaft of light. He welcomes the adventurers' rescue and bids them {{to turn on the}} headlights and prepare for him to board. As the lights flicker on, they illuminate a massive boulder rolling toward the transport. The transport seems to back up as the boulder threatens to crush Jones and the tourists. At the last possible second, the transport accelerates and suddenly the floor seems to give way, sending the transport <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> below. An impact resonates through the chamber, as if the boulder has crashed down, nearly striking the transport.|$|E
25|$|An open-bolt {{mechanism}} {{is a common}} characteristic of fully automatic firearms. With this system, pulling the trigger releases the bolt from a cocked, rearward position, pushing a cartridge from the magazine <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> firing the gun. The bolt retracts to the rearward position, ready to strip the next cartridge from the magazine. The open-bolt system is often used in submachine guns and other weapons with {{a high rate of}} fire. It is rarely used in semi-automatic-only firearms, which can fire only one shot with each pull of the trigger. The closed-bolt system is generally more accurate, as the centre of gravity changes relatively little at the moment the trigger is pulled.|$|E
25|$|The Krag–Petersson repeating rifle has {{a falling}} block action, i.e. the {{breechblock}} moves downwards as the mechanism is opened, actuated (operated) by {{the operation of}} the exterior hammer. The tubular magazine, containing a total of 10 rounds of ammunition, was placed under the barrel. Once the mechanism was open, an extractor ejected the spent cartridge. A fresh round of ammunition was pushed into a shaped recess on top of the falling block by the spring in the magazine, whereupon the falling block rose slightly. The round could then be pushed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> by the shooter, and the breechblock would rise completely. This rising of the breechblock (by means of a powerful spring) could catch the shooter off guard, resulting in pinched skin on the thumb.|$|E
5000|$|Rasmussenoceras, {{named by}} Foerste (1932); a tripteroceratid {{from the middle}} and upper Ordovician of North America and Greenland with a broadly {{lenticular}} section and sharp lateral angles, in which the ventral siphuncle is suborthochoantitic to orthohoantic with segments only slightly expanded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Taifun was {{powered by}} a hypergolic mixture {{pressure-fed}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> combustion <b>chamber.</b> <b>The</b> pressure was provided by small cordite charges that were fired <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fuel tanks, in the process bursting a pair of thin diaphragms to allow the fuel and oxidizer to flow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> combustion <b>chamber.</b> <b>The</b> Germans {{were never able to}} get the engine to work reliably, and the rocket was never deployed operationally.|$|R
50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{is usually}} made of glass, or sometimes of polyethylene, {{and consists of}} three vertically stacked chambers, roughly resembling a snowman. <b>The</b> upper <b>chamber</b> extends downward as a tube that passes through <b>the</b> middle <b>chamber</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>chamber.</b> There is no direct path between {{the middle and upper}} <b>chambers,</b> but <b>the</b> middle <b>chamber</b> is separated from <b>the</b> lower <b>chamber</b> by a retention plate, such as a conical piece of glass with small holes, which permits the passage of liquid and gas. The solid material (e.g., iron sulfide) is placed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>chamber</b> in lumps sufficiently large to avoid falling through the retention plate. The liquid, such as an acid, is poured <b>into</b> <b>the</b> top <b>chamber.</b> Although <b>the</b> acid is free to flow down through <b>the</b> tube <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>chamber,</b> it is prevented from rising there by the pressure of the gas contained above it, which is able to leave the apparatus only by a stopcock near the top of <b>the</b> middle <b>chamber.</b> This stopcock may be opened, initially to permit the air to leave the apparatus, allowing the liquid in <b>the</b> bottom <b>chamber</b> to rise through <b>the</b> retention plate <b>into</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>chamber</b> and react with the solid material. Gas is evolved from this reaction, which may be drawn off through the stopcock as desired. When the stopcock is closed, the pressure of the evolved gas in <b>the</b> middle <b>chamber</b> rises and pushes the acid back down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>chamber,</b> until it is not in contact with the solid material anymore. At that point the chemical reaction comes to a stop, until the stopcock is opened again and more gas is drawn off.|$|R
