But it is head-work and heart-work too, and the men who wrought at it wrought with such intensity and constancy that they did not once look up or round where we paused to look on. I was made to know that trade was dull and work slack, and these fellows were lucky fellows to have anything to do. Still I did not envy them; and I felt it a distinct relief to pass from their shops into the cool, dim crypt which was filled with tusks of ivory, in all sizes from those of the largest father elephant to those of the babes of the herd; these were milk-tusks, I suppose. They get dearer as the elephants get scarcer; and that must have been why I paid as much for a penknife in the glittering showroom as it would have cost me in New York, with the passage money and the duties added. Because of the price, perhaps, I did not think of buying the two-thousand-bladed penknife I saw there; but I could never have used all the blades, now that we no longer make quill pens. I looked fondly at the maker's name on the knife I did buy, and said that the table cutlery of a certain small household which set itself up forty years ago had borne the same: but the pleasant salesman did not seem to feel the pathos of the fact so much as I.|$|E

30|$|The {{bioethanol}} {{from corn}} (<b>dry</b> <b>grind</b> production, USA), as a rule, {{in order to}} produce ethanol from corn, it is necessary to use fossil fuel (mainly gas). For this reason, in California (USA), the corn-based ethanol does not qualify as fuel that sufficiently reduces GHG emissions. The agricultural yield of corn (USA) and sugarcane (Brazil) were 9.59 and 79.19 tons ha− 1, respectively, in 2010. The bioethanol production yield from corn (USA) and sugarcane (Brazil) are 371 and 85 L ton− 1, respectively.

40|$|It {{has been}} widely debated whether {{producing}} ethanol from corn is sustainable in the long term. Environmentally, the major concern is that producing ethanol from corn involves intensive water and energy consumption. Economically, recent fluctuations in petroleum, ethanol, and corn prices have driven several large producers of ethanol into bankruptcy. The ethanol industry is vulnerable to periods of economic weakness because its product value varies with oil prices but its raw material (corn) varies with food prices. To improve the economic sustainability of corn-to-ethanol production, several modified <b>dry</b> <b>grind</b> processes had been developed at the lab scale. The Quick-germ / Quick-fiber (QQ) process is one of them. However, {{there has been no}} analysis of the QQ process that provides detailed information related to the energy, water, and economic performance at a commercial scale. To determine the both environmental and economic performance, a process simulation model was developed on the SuperPro Designer?? platform to simulate the QQ process, and compared to the conventional <b>dry</b> <b>grind</b> model. Results indicate that germ and fiber recovery as done in the QQ process improves the process capacity of a conventional <b>dry</b> <b>grind</b> ethanol facility by approximately 24 %. Because of germ and fiber recovery at the front end, the ethanol concentration has been increased to 15 % (w/w) as compared to 10. 9 (w/w) in the conventional <b>dry</b> <b>grind</b> process. The QQ process reduces the energy and water consumption by 32 % and 17. 8 %, respectively. The QQ process produces more value-added coproducts, including corn germ, corn fiber, and a modified distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), but has a lower ethanol yield rate due to some starch losses to the recovered germ and fiber fractions at the front end. A detailed cost and benefit analysis of the QQ process, based on the market prices in April 2009, shows that despite its higher capital investment costs, the QQ process reduces the payback period to 6. 5 years, compared to 9. 2 years for the conventional <b>dry</b> <b>grind</b> process. Increased ethanol production, more value-added coproducts, as well as significant reduced utility costs are three major contributors to improve the economic performance of the QQ process. This work lays the foundation for the similar studies on the sustainability performance for other modified <b>dry</b> <b>grind</b> ethanol processes...|$|R

5000|$|The {{wet process}} {{suffered}} the obvious disadvantage that, when the slurry was {{introduced into the}} kiln, {{a large amount of}} extra fuel was used in evaporating the water. Furthermore, a larger kiln was needed for a given clinker output, because much of the kiln's length was used up for the drying process. On the other hand, the wet process had a number of advantages. Wet grinding of hard minerals is usually much more efficient than <b>dry</b> <b>grinding.</b> When slurry is dried in the kiln, it forms a granular crumble that is ideal for subsequent heating in the kiln. In the dry process, {{it is very difficult to}} keep the fine powder rawmix in the kiln, because the fast-flowing combustion gases tend to blow it back out again. It became a practice to spray water into dry kilns in order to [...] "damp down" [...] the dry mix, and thus, for many years there was little difference in efficiency between the two processes, and the overwhelming majority of kilns used the wet process. By 1950, a typical large, wet process kiln, fitted with drying-zone heat exchangers, was 3.3 x 120 m in size, made 680 tonnes per day, and used about 0.25-0.30 tonnes of coal fuel for every tonne of clinker produced. Before the energy crisis of the 1970s put an end to new wet-process installations, kilns as large as 5.8 x 225 m in size were making 3000 tonnes per day.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of Iowa’s ethanol industry has changed corn distribution patterns to support more local processing. As more corn is used locally in fuel production, less is available for export, feed applications, and other processing. This has led to changes in grain transport, on-farm grain storage, and the function of local grain elevators. This study collected data to indicate the magnitude of current and future impacts of ethanol production on Iowa agricultural logistics.

40|$|In a {{conventional}} <b>dry</b> <b>grind</b> process, corn is processed to produce ethanol {{and a low}} valued animal food coproduct called distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). Approximately 33 % of corn in <b>dry</b> <b>grind</b> ethanol plant becomes DDGS. Due to its high fiber content DDGS has traditionally being sold as ruminant foodstuffs. New fractionation technologies are being implemented to recovery valuable coproducts, reduce amount of DDGS produced and improve fermentation efficiency in conventional <b>dry</b> <b>grind</b> ethanol plants. These technologies include corn fractionation as well as DDGS fractionation. Corn fractionation can be broadly classified as wet and dry technologies. Wet fractionation involves a short soaking of corn followed by milling to recover germ, pericarp fiber and/or endosperm fiber in an aqueous medium prior to fermentation of degermed defibered slurry. In dry fractionation, a dry degerm defiber process is used to separate germ and pericarp fiber prior to fermentation of the endosperm fraction. Both wet and dry processes reduce {{the total amount of}} DDGS produced, increase it protein content and reduce its fiber content. Depending upon the modified process used, the amount of DDGS produced can be reduced by 70 % and its protein content can be increased to 58 %. DDGS fractionation involves sieving and elutriation (aspiration) to separate fiber from DDGS. This process recovers fiber as a coproduct, increases protein and fat content of residual DDGS and reduces the fiber content of residual DDGS. Depending upon the parameters used this process increased protein and fat contents of residual DDGS from 28 to 41 % and 12 to 14 %, respectively. A reduction in fiber content and increase in protein content of DDGS could allow increased use of DDGS as nonruminant foodstuffs...|$|R

The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS 2) under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) currently requires the production and use of 136. 08 billion liters of renewable fuels by the year 2022. A significant portion of the requirement will come from the production of corn [Zea mays L. ] grain ethanol. Currently, two processes are primarily used to produce ethanol from corn, the <b>dry</b> <b>grind</b> process and the wet mill process. With the dramatic increase in corn grain usage for ethanol production, it is important to determine how management practice decisions affect both <b>dry</b> <b>grind</b> and wet mill ethanol yield and ethanol by-product quality. This study was conducted in Missouri during the 2007 and 2008 growing season to determine whether the management practices of planting date, planting density, or environment (location and year) have a significant affect corn grain yield, ethanol yield and kernel characteristics important in ethanol by-product quality. Whole kernel samples were tested using a FOSS Infratec 1241 Grain Analyzer to analyze kernel composition with near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Starch was not a good predictor of ethanol yield while consistent relationships were observed for protein with positive correlations for <b>dry</b> <b>grind</b> ethanol yield and negative correlations for wet mill ethanol yield. Management practices had the largest affect on grain yield while ethanol yield and kernel composition were affected to a lesser extent. This suggests selecting a planting date and planting density based on achieving the highest grain yield would be most effective practice to help meet the current RFS 2 requirements...|$|R

The effect of solids loading on pretreatment of DDGS and on subsequent acetone‐butanol‐ethanol (ABE) fermentation was examined.

In fermentation tests using Clostridium acetobutylicum P 260 for ABE production, the highest ABE concentration was ~ 17 g L- 1, which was achieved from alkaline electrolyzed water pretreated samples at 30 % (w/w) solids loading. The solids loading in a pretreatment significantly affected both the sugar yield from enzymatic hydrolysis and the ABE yield from fermentation of DDGS hydrolysates. The hydrolysate from alkaline electrolyzed water pretreatment at 30 % (w/w) solids was found to be most favorable to ABE production, while that from sulfuric acid pretreatment was the least fermentable, although it produced the highest sugar yield...|$|R
