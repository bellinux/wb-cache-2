5|$|The {{reason for}} Ghazis fate is unclear. The Indian Navy's {{official}} historian, Hiranandani, suggests three possibilities, after having analysed {{the position of}} the rudder and extent of the damage suffered. The first was that Ghazi had come up to periscope depth to identify her position and may have seen an anti-submarine vessel that caused her to crash dive, which in turn may have led her to bury her bow in the bottom. The second possibility is closely related to the first: {{on the night of the}} explosion, Rajput was on patrol off Visakhapatnam and observed a severe disturbance in the water. Suspecting that it was a submarine, the ship dropped two depth charges on the spot, on a position that was very close to the wreckage. The third possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a mishap when Ghazi was laying mines on the day before hostilities broke out.|$|E
25|$|The results {{suggested}} that all four treatment conditions resulted in similar reductions in cocaine {{use with the}} IDC + GDC group (TSF) {{more effective than the}} other three groups. One issue with this study <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> significant attrition of patients, with significantly larger numbers of dropouts from the TSF groups than from the others.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the reasons}} there are textual {{problems}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no copyright of writings at the time. As a result, Shakespeare and the playing companies he worked with did not distribute scripts of his plays, for fear that the plays would be stolen. This led to bootleg copies of his plays, which were often based on people trying to remember what Shakespeare had actually written.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} interpretation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no magnetic monopoles.|$|R

25|$|Another {{possibility}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a slowing of thermohaline circulation. The circulation {{could have}} been interrupted {{by the introduction of}} a large amount of fresh water into the North Atlantic, possibly caused by a period of warming before the Little Ice Age known as the Medieval Warm Period. There is some concern that a shutdown of thermohaline circulation could happen again {{as a result of the}} present warming period.|$|E
25|$|Henry (1977) {{alluded to}} Maclean's {{model of the}} {{tripartite}} brain suggesting that the reptilian brain is an older {{part of the brain}} and may contain not only drives but archetypal structures as well. The suggestion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a time when emotional behaviour and cognition were less developed and the older brain predominated. There is an obvious parallel with Jung's idea of the archetypes 'crystallising out' over time.|$|E
25|$|His {{conclusion}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no bias in {{the arithmetic}} errors (in other words, they were not present more often in the polling places won by {{one or the other}} candidate); he concludes that the errors were likely caused by the normal distribution of mathematical and organizational abilities of the randomly selected citizens in the polling place, and in the sometimes confusing design of the tally sheets and inadequate training of polling place workers.|$|E

25|$|Improvement in farm {{implements}} led {{to changes in}} farming and large-scale industrialization {{put an end to}} much traditional farm work. An interesting note to the agricultural heritage of the community <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> resistance from the village residents in the late l9th century to the removal of pig-sties from private homes and it is on record that there were eight farms in the village which were required to be registered as dairies.|$|E
25|$|A rival {{conclusion}} by {{some historians}} (Terraine, Sheffield, Duffy, Chickering, Herwig and Philpott et al.) <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no strategic alternative for the British in 1916 {{and that an}} understandable horror at British losses is insular, given the millions of casualties borne by the French and Russian armies since 1914. This school of thought sets the battle {{in a context of}} a general Allied offensive in 1916 and notes that German and French writing on the battle puts it in a continental perspective.|$|E
25|$|Pliego Carrasco {{criticizes the}} Alianza's filings {{by stating that}} they were based only on {{individual}} situations rather than a widespread study, that the information was based almost invariably on newspaper clippings, and that they only studied 26 districts. For his own study, Pliego Carrasco contrasted the growth in votes from the 2000 to the 2006 election for all parties. In all cases, the Alianza increased substantially more than the PAN, which even lost votes in the two categories of lowest marginalization. His conclusion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{no evidence that the}} PAN benefited from the expenditures. He found no statistical correlation between expenditures and the winning candidate. He derived similar conclusions for the other four programs. His conclusion is that the vote distribution does not support the hypothesis that social programs were used wholesale to influence the vote.|$|E

25|$|As the Earth cooled, clouds formed. Rain {{created the}} oceans. Recent {{evidence}} suggests the oceans {{may have begun}} forming as early as 4.4Ga. By {{the start of the}} Archean eon, they already covered much of the Earth. This early formation has been difficult to explain because of a problem known as the faint young Sun paradox. Stars are known to get brighter as they age, and {{at the time of its}} formation the Sun would have been emitting only 70% of its current power. Thus, the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years. Many models indicate that the Earth would have been covered in ice. A likely solution <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> enough carbon dioxide and methane to produce a greenhouse effect. The carbon dioxide would have been produced by volcanoes and the methane by early microbes. Another greenhouse gas, ammonia, would have been ejected by volcanos but quickly destroyed by ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
500|$|The exact {{scope and}} {{mechanisms}} of Indian cultural influences on early Philippine polities {{are still the}} subject of some debate among Southeast Asian historiographers, but the current scholarly consensus <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> probably little or no direct trade between India and the Philippines, and Indian cultural traits, such as linguistic terms and religious practices, filtered in during the 10th through the early 14th centuries, through early Philippine polities' relations with the Hindu Majapahit empire. The Philippine archipelago is thus one of the countries, (others include Afghanistan and Southern Vietnam) just at {{the outer edge of}} what is considered the [...] "Greater Indian cultural zone".|$|E
500|$|Prior to the Viking incursions the {{southern}} Hebrides formed {{part of the}} Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata (or Dalriada). North of Dál Riata the Inner and Outer Hebrides were nominally under Pictish control although the historical record is sparse. According to Ó Corráin (1998) [...] "when and how the Vikings conquered and occupied the Isles is unknown, perhaps unknowable", although from 793 onwards repeated raids by Vikings on the British Isles are recorded. [...] "All the islands of Britain" [...] were devastated in 794 with Iona being sacked in 802 and 806. [...] Various named Viking leaders, who were probably based in Scotland, appear in the Irish annals: Soxulfr in 837, Turges in 845 and Hákon in 847.

500|$|From 793 onwards {{repeated}} raids by Vikings on the British Isles are recorded. [...] "All {{the islands}} of Britain" [...] were devastated in 794 with Iona being sacked in 802 and 806. (These attacks on Christian settlements in {{the islands of}} the west were not new. In the 6th century Tiree was raided by Pictish forces, Tory Island was attacked in the early 7th century by a [...] "marine fleet" [...] and Donnán of Eigg and 52 companions were murdered by Picts on Eigg in 617.) [...] Various named Viking leaders, who were probably based in Scotland, appear in the Irish annals: Soxulfr in 837, Turges in 845 and Hákon in 847. The king of Fortriu Eógan mac Óengusa and the king of Dál Riata Áed mac Boanta were among the dead in a major defeat to the Vikings in 839. Another early reference to the Norse presence in the Irish records <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a king of [...] "Viking Scotland" [...] whose heir, Thórir, brought an army to Ireland in 848. Caittil Find was a reported leader of the Gallgáedil fighting in Ireland in 857.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} regular nuclear testing, Kittens {{represents}} bomb component testing, while Tims and Rats were early subcritical hydronuclear tests. [...] Vixen is [...] "safety testing" [...] of a bomb; assuring {{that the core}} would not accidentally undergo criticality {{in the event of}} a fire or unintended crash. These are always messy (see the US equivalent at Plutonium Valley in Project 56), for a successful test subjects the core fuel to high explosives in the hope that it simply scatters rather than undergoes criticality. The differences in the sort of dangers presented by major vs the minor tests <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no critical explosion in the minor tests. [...] In the major tests, the bomb cores reached critical mass; the plutonium or uranium fissile materials [...] "burned" [...] into highly radioactive fission products, and those, along with the unspent fuel and activated bomb case, tower and soil if the explosion was close to the ground, are lofted into the stratosphere to be dropped eventually as fallout globally. In Vixen, an equivalent amount of plutonium fuel was simply smashed by explosives and spread about much more locally. [...] In Kittens, Tims and Rats, smaller amounts of various materials were similar exploded locally and spread about.|$|E
