50|$|Later models {{featured}} {{a series of}} fixed sockets and an <b>interchangeable</b> <b>socket</b> module in one housing. Memory devices up to 40 pins in size could be read or programmed with the simple installation of the appropriate socket module. The 29B chassis could accommodate up to 1MB of user RAM.|$|E
50|$|A spinner handle is a {{shaft and}} handle with a drive fitting—most {{commonly}} ¼"—at {{the end for}} attaching <b>interchangeable</b> <b>sockets.</b> This allows one to use a single handle {{with a number of}} sizes instead of having a separate nut driver for each size. However, a spinner lacks the benefit of a hollow shaft; thus, a common alternative system is a single handle with interchangeable shafts in each size.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} <b>interchangeable</b> <b>sockets</b> is that, {{instead of a}} separate wrench {{for each of the}} many different fastener sizes and types, only separate sockets are needed for each size and type. Because of their versatility, nearly all screw and bolt types now have sockets of different types made to fit their bolts or nuts. Sockets often come as a [...] "socket set" [...] with many different sizes or types of sockets to fit the heads of different-sized fasteners. A ratchet of the [...] "set size" [...] is often included with the socket set. Sockets are commonly available in fractional inch and metric sizes, and in short (shallow) and longer (deep) varieties.|$|R
50|$|One {{of their}} first {{attempts}} at a 'Universal' programmer was the Model 1, Model 5 (TTL-Sequencer based), Model 9 (Microprocessor based),and the System 19 (introduced in the late 1970s). It utilized <b>interchangeable</b> device <b>sockets</b> and configuration plug-in printed-circuit cards, consisting mainly of resistors, diodes and jumpers, to allow reading and programming {{of a variety of}} memory devices.|$|R
5000|$|Wrenches in {{the form}} of —that is, a female driver to envelop the male head of a fastener—have existed for centuries. Early {{examples}} include the keys used to wind clocks since the Middle Ages. The heads and sockets were typically square; hex heads eventually became more common starting in the 20th century. The ratcheting <b>socket</b> wrench, with <b>interchangeable</b> (indexable) <b>sockets,</b> was invented by an American, J.J. Richardson, of Woodstock, Vermont, USA. The tool was patented (Pat. No. 38,914) through the Scientific American Patent Agency on June 16, 1863. The first illustration of the tool appears on pg. 248 of the April 16, 1864 issue of Scientific American. In current English usage, the term [...] "socket wrench" [...] connotes indexable sockets so strongly that most English speakers would resist calling a large non-indexable, non-racheting, socket-head wrench a [...] "socket wrench." ...|$|R
