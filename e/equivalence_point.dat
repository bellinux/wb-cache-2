5|$|Between the two buffer regions {{there is}} an {{end-point}}, or <b>equivalence</b> <b>point,</b> at about pH 3. This end-point is not sharp and is typical of a diprotic acid whose buffer regions overlap by a small amount: pKa2 − pKa1 is about three in this example. (If the difference in pK values were about two or less, the end-point would not be noticeable.) The second end-point begins at about pH  6.3 and is sharp. This indicates that all the protons have been removed. When this is so, the solution is not buffered and the pH rises steeply on addition of {{a small amount of}} strong base. However, the pH does not continue to rise indefinitely. A new buffer region begins at about pH 11 (pKw − 3), which is where self-ionization of water becomes important.|$|E
25|$|The {{electrodes}} are {{immersed in}} the solution to be titrated and the potential difference between the electrodes is measured. Measured volumes of titrant are added, with thorough (magnetic) stirring, and the corresponding values of emf (electromotive force) or pH recorded. Small increments in volume should be added near the <b>equivalence</b> <b>point</b> which is found graphically by noting the burette reading corresponding to the maximum change of emf or pH per unit change of volume. When {{the slope of the}} curve is more gradual it is not always easy to locate the equivalent point by this method. However, if small increments (0.1nbsp&cm³ or less) of titrant are added near the end point of the titration and a curve of change of emf or pH per unit volume against volume of titrant is plotted, a differential curve is obtained in which the <b>equivalence</b> <b>point</b> is indicated by a peak.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{successive}} dissociation processes, {{there are two}} equivalence points in the titration curve of a diprotic acid. The first <b>equivalence</b> <b>point</b> occurs when all first hydrogen ions from the first ionization are titrated. In other words, the amount of OH− added equals the original amount of H2A at the first <b>equivalence</b> <b>point.</b> The second <b>equivalence</b> <b>point</b> occurs when all hydrogen ions are titrated. Therefore, the amount of OH− added equals twice the amount of H2A at this time. For a weak diprotic acid titrated by a strong base, the second <b>equivalence</b> <b>point</b> must occur at pH above 7 due to the hydrolysis of the resulted salts in the solution. At either <b>equivalence</b> <b>point,</b> adding a drop of base will cause the steepest rise of the pH value in the system.|$|E

50|$|If one reagent is a {{weak acid}} or {{base and the}} other is a strong acid or base, the {{titration}} curve is irregular and the pH shifts less with small additions of titrant near the <b>equivalence</b> <b>point.</b> For example, the titration curve for the titration between oxalic acid (a weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base) is pictured. The <b>equivalence</b> <b>point</b> occurs between pH 8-10, indicating the solution is basic at the <b>equivalence</b> <b>point</b> and an indicator such as phenolphthalein would be appropriate. Titration curves corresponding to weak bases and strong acids are similarly behaved, with the solution being acidic at the <b>equivalence</b> <b>point</b> and indicators such as methyl orange and bromothymol blue being most appropriate.|$|E
50|$|After enough titrant {{has been}} added to react {{completely}} with the analyte, the excess titrant may itself be reduced at the working electrode. Since this is a different species with different diffusion characteristics (and different half-reaction), the slope of current versus added titrant will have a different slope after the <b>equivalence</b> <b>point.</b> This change in slope marks the <b>equivalence</b> <b>point,</b> in the same way that, for instance, the sudden change in pH marks the <b>equivalence</b> <b>point</b> in an acid-base titration.|$|E

Through careful software engineering and various heuristics, this technique has been demonstrated capable of yielding orders of magnitude speedup on difficult industrial conditional SEC problems, in cases constituting the only method that we have found to achieve an automated solution.
