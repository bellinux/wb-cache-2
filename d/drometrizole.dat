50|$|<b>Drometrizole</b> trisiloxane (INCI) is a {{lipophilic}} benzotriazole derivative {{marketed as}} Mexoryl XL by L'Oréal {{and is used}} in sunscreens to absorb UV radiation. It is a broad-spectrum UV absorber with two absorption peaks, one at 303 nm (UVB) and one at 344 nm (UVA). Just like Mexoryl SX (ecamsule), it is used exclusively in products by L'Oréal owned brands. <b>Drometrizole</b> trisiloxane and ecamsule are often used together, because they show a synergistic effect in protection.|$|E

40|$|A {{solid-phase}} microextraction (SPME) {{coupled with}} gas chromatography followed by mass spectrometry {{was developed for}} the determination of triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) in aqueous media originated from cured dental composite. Cylindrical specimens of a common dental composite were cured and immersed for 48 h in 3 mL portions of human saliva and also some non-biologic media e. g., pure water and Ringer’s solution. The extraction {{was carried out by}} direct SPME for 15 min. The efficiency and reliability of some commercially available and modified pencil lead fibers were evaluated for the extraction of interest compound from aqueous media. Some effective and experimental parameters of SPME and gas chromatography procedures were examined and optimized. The obtained results reveal that the direct SPME using the modified pencil lead is very effective and can extract TEGDMA with a good selectivety from among various compounds such as 2, 6 -di-tert-butyl- 4 -methyl phenol (buylated hydroxy toluene) (BHT), 2 -propenoic acid, 2 -methyl-oxybis (2, 1 -ethanediyl oxy- 2, 1 -ethanediyl) ester (TEEGDMA), 3, 5 -di-t-butyl- 4 -hydroxy benzaldehyde, benzoic acid 4 (dimethyl-amino) -ethyl ester (DMA BEE), 2 -propenoic acid, 2 -methyl-dodecyl ester (methacrylic acid, dodecyl ester), 2 -ethoxy ethyl methacrylate, and <b>drometrizole</b> (TINP). The results obtained also prove that the studied composite releases 11. 0, 13. 4, and 28. 3 µg/mL TEGDMA into distilled water, Ringer’s solution, and saliva, respectively, at 48 h of the exposition...|$|E
