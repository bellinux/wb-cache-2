The process factors {{influencing}} the forming quality of car <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> such as stamping direction, binder surface, draw-bead, addendum surface and technical cut are determined {{based on experience}} knowledge. Aiming at local fracture problem of test pieces, some key parameters are determined based on experience knowledge, and the strain in thinning area of sheet metal forming is analyzed by numerical simulation. Based on this, process optimization and die modification scheme are put forward. Engineering inspection proved that optimized process and die parameters are reasonable, after increasing die fillet radius and process hole radius, decreasing draw-bead height, qualified products are achieved and fracture flaw is well controlled...|$|E
40|$|Among various efforts pursued {{to produce}} fuel {{efficient}} vehicles, light weight engineering (i. e. {{the use of}} low-density structurally-efficient materials, the application of advanced manufacturing and joining technologies and the design of highly-integrated, multi-functional components/sub-assemblies) plays a prominent role. In the present work, a multi-disciplinary design optimization methodology has been presented and subsequently applied {{to the development of}} a light composite vehicle door (more specifically, to an <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> <b>panel).</b> The door design has been optimized with respect to its weight while meeting the requirements /constraints pertaining to the structural and NVH performances, crashworthiness, durability and manufacturability. In the optimization procedure, the number and orientation of the composite plies, the local laminate thickness and the shape of different door panel segments (each characterized by a given composite-lay-up architecture and uniform ply thicknesses) are used as design variables. The methodology developed in the present work is subsequently used to carry out weight optimization of the front door on Ford Taurus, model year 2001. The emphasis in the present work is placed on highlighting the scientific and engineering issues accompanying multi-disciplinary design optimization and less on the outcome of the optimization analysis and th...|$|E

40|$|This work is {{intended}} to apprehend which door vibrations contribute to the visible motion occuring during closure,where they emanate from and how they may be abolished. The human ability to distinguish mechanical vibrations is not well-known and should be experimentally investigated. On account on its inertia, the eye perception weakens over frequency and, in particular, no dynamic motion can be discerned over 50 Hz. This determines the upper frequency limit of visibility and rejects the currently assumed value 10 Hz higher. Below 50 Hz, mechanical vibrations may be visible {{as long as their}} amplitude is larger than an experimentally-defined threshold. The frequency domain of interests is deep. During the closure process, the main excitation arises from the water strips that brake the door and transmit energy into inner panels. The resulting vibrations travel towards outer panels because of the strong coupling between the both. Provided that the door natural properties that are likely to be excited from the closure process do not appear below 50 Hz, no external vibrations will be distinguished. Inner panels act as transfer systems between excitation and outer panels, thus their construction must be specifically emphasised. As a rule the current structures are not stiff enough,in particular <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> that {{turn out to be a}} source of weakness. Practical ways to improve the construction are discussed and must be further investigated, for instance using FEM calculations, of which consistence is assessed in this work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cars have {{various types}} of doors. The {{swinging}} doors which {{are the most common}} are almost the most complicated parts in a car since they not only determine the general guidelines of car style, but also are vital for passenger's safety by protecting humans from side crashes. Comparison between FEA results and targets led to the necessity to split lower opening of front door into two parts to increase stiffness. Also, thickness of window regulator engine fixing in both front and rear doors are increased. Predetermined values from previous works conducted on a similar existing SUV vehicle were used as targets to be achieved by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of car doors. Mobile hinge fixing is duplicated for both front and rear <b>doors</b> <b>Inner</b> <b>panel</b> opening in front door window lower mechanism are also decreased...|$|R
50|$|The Basilica of San Zeno Maggiore is Romanesque style church, {{the third}} such {{structure}} on its site, built from 1123-1135, over the 4th-century shrine to Verona's patron saint, St. Zeno (died 380). The façade dominates the large square, and is flanked {{with a beautiful}} 72 metres tall bell tower, which is mentioned by Dante in Canto 18 of Purgatory in the Divine Comedy. The weathered Veronese stone gives a warm golden glow, and the restrained lines of the pillars, columns, and cornices, and the gallery with its double windows, give the façade an air of harmonious elegance. The huge rose window is decorated as a Wheel of Fortune. The lintels above the portal have carvings of the months of the year. Each side of the doorway is embellished with 18 bas-relief panels of biblical scenes, and the <b>inner</b> bronze <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> have 48 primitive but forceful depictions of Biblical scenes and episodes {{from the life of}} St Zeno. The meaning of some of the scenes is now unknown, but the extraordinarily vivid energy of the figures is a superb blend of traditional and Ottonian influences. The interior of the church is divided into the Lower Church, occupying about ⅔ of the structure, and the Upper Church, occupying the remainder. The walls are covered with 12th and 14th century frescos and the ceiling of the nave is a magnificent example of a ship's keel ceiling. The vaulted crypt contains the tomb of St. Zeno, the first Bishop of Verona, as well as the tombs of several other saints. North of the church is a pleasant cloister. The church also houses the tomb of King Pippin of Italy (777-810).|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Washington State UniversityCurrent welding {{technologies}} for production of aluminum tailor-welded blanks (TWBs) are utilized in low-volume and niche applications, and {{have yet to}} be scaled for the high-volume vehicle market. This study targeted further weight reduction, part reduction, and cost savings by enabling tailor-welded blank technology for aluminum alloys at high-volumes. While friction stir welding (FSW) has traditionally been applied at linear velocities less than one meter per minute, high volume production applications demand the process be extended to higher velocities more amenable to cost sensitive production environments. Unfortunately, weld parameters and performance developed and characterized at low to moderate welding velocities do not directly translate to high speed linear friction stir welding. Therefore, in order to facilitate production of high volume aluminum FSW components, parameters were developed with a minimum welding velocity of three meters per minute. With an emphasis on weld quality, welded blanks were evaluated for post-weld formability using a combination of numerical and experimental methods. Evaluation across scales was ultimately validated by stamping full-size production <b>door</b> <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> made from dissimilar thickness aluminum tailor-welded blanks, which provided validation of the numerical and experimental analysis of laboratory scale tests.

40|$|Short {{take-off}} {{and vertical}} landing (STOVL) ventral nozzle concepts are investigated {{by means of}} a static cold flow scale model at a NASA facility. The internal aerodynamic performance characteristics of the cruise, transition, and vertical lift modes are considered for four ventral nozzle types. The nozzle configurations examined include those with: butterfly-type <b>inner</b> <b>doors</b> and vectoring exit vanes; circumferential <b>inner</b> <b>doors</b> and thrust vectoring vanes; a three-port segmented version with circumferential inner doors; and a two-port segmented version with cylindrical nozzle exit shells. During the testing, internal and external pressure is measured, and the thrust and flow coefficients and resultant vector angles are obtained. The <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> used for ventral nozzle flow control is found to affect performance negatively during the initial phase of transition. The best thrust performance is demonstrated by the two-port segmented ventral nozzle due to the elimination of the <b>inner</b> <b>door...</b>|$|R

The company produces <b>door</b> <b>panels,</b> instrument panels, consoles and cockpits for the automotive industry. During the production of <b>door</b> <b>panels,</b> defects such as pressure marks and scratches emerge which results in scrap and rework. The objective of the thesis work was to identify the causes of pressure marks and scratches and also to suggest measures {{to reduce the amount}} of scrap and rework on <b>door</b> <b>panels.</b> Through observations, interviews and experiments, several causes leading to pressure marks and scratches on <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> were identified. Small pieces of plastics on fixtures, the operator's rough handling and specific process steps are the main causes that result in pressure marks and scratches. Pressure marks and scratches emerge at several places on the <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> during the production. To reduce the amount of pressure marks and scratches both short-term and long-term measures were suggested.
