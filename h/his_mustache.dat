5|$|Burnside {{was noted}} for his unusual facial hair, joining strips of hair {{in front of}} his ears to <b>his</b> <b>mustache</b> but with the chin clean-shaven; the word burnsides was coined to {{describe}} this style. The syllables were later reversed to give sideburns.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} prepares for the {{memorial}} service, Leslie and Ben are caught making {{out by a}} maintenance worker named George (Biff Yeager), so they send him home with a gift certificate {{in exchange for his}} silence. Unfortunately, George had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get propane for the flame but buys lighter fluid instead; this causes a huge fireball to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off his eyebrows, part of <b>his</b> <b>mustache</b> and hair. Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged. Entertainment 720's show also proves to be a hit with the crowd, which makes Tom further contemplate quitting his job.|$|E

25|$|In 2017, amid {{allegations}} that Holmes {{had in fact}} escaped execution, Holmes' body was exhumed for testing. Due to his coffin being contained in cement, his body was found not to have decomposed normally. His clothes were almost perfectly preserved and <b>his</b> <b>mustache</b> {{was found to be}} intact. The body was positively identified as being that of Holmes with his teeth. Holmes was then reburied.|$|E
25|$|The greasepaint {{mustache}} and eyebrows originated spontaneously {{prior to a}} vaudeville performance in the early 1920s {{when he did not}} have time to apply the pasted-on mustache he had been using (or, according to his autobiography, simply did not enjoy the removal of the mustache every night because of the effects of tearing an adhesive bandage off the same patch of skin every night). After applying the greasepaint mustache, a quick glance in the mirror revealed his natural hair eyebrows were too undertoned and did not match the rest of his face, so Marx added the greasepaint to his eyebrows and headed for the stage. The absurdity of the greasepaint was never discussed on-screen, but in a famous scene in Duck Soup, where both Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) disguise themselves as Groucho, they are briefly seen applying the greasepaint, implicitly answering any question a viewer might have had about where he got <b>his</b> <b>mustache</b> and eyebrows.|$|E

25|$|Gomez, a {{longtime}} journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke {{in the mid-1970s}} when Duke was a state senate candidate:He {{was still in his}} mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and we shook hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved <b>his</b> <b>mustache.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mario Cavaradossi is {{descended from}} an old Roman family, but was born in France, where his father had lived most of his life. The family still had a palazzo on the Piazza di Spagna in Rome and once owned the country villa which Cavaradossi now rents. His father had strong ties with Diderot and d'Alembert, {{and his mother was}} a grand-niece of the French philosopher Helvétius. Cavaradossi studied art in Paris with Jacques-Louis David and lived in David's atelier during the French Revolution. When he visited Rome in 1800 to settle his father's estate, he met {{and fell in love with}} the celebrated opera singer Floria Tosca, and decided to prolong his stay. He soon gained a {{reputation}} as a free-thinker and Bonapartist. Even <b>his</b> <b>mustache</b> was suspect. Tosca's confessor told her it marked him as a revolutionary. To deflect these suspicions, he offered to do a painting in the church of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale for free. Nicassio has speculated that one of the influences on Sardou's choice of name was the extremely similar name Caravadossi, a noble Italian family from Nice, the birthplace of Garibaldi, and at several points in its history under Italian control. One of the Caravadossi descendants fought in the 19th century Italian Wars of Independence.|$|E

His attempts at building the house frustrate Homer, and he curses loud enough for Todd to overhear. After Todd says [...] "hell no" [...] and [...] "damn" [...] at dinner, his father Ned eventually discovers that he learned those words from Homer. He complains to Homer, who in turn criticizes Ned's mustache. Ned promises to shave off <b>his</b> <b>mustache</b> in return for Homer curtailing uses of profanity.

500|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is on a {{business}} call with the investors {{and members of the}} business venture he is up for. Many distractions from the background make the call difficult. At the end of the day, Jim apologizes, but then hears the person on the phone saying this is not working out. Meanwhile, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) convinces several {{of the men in the}} office to grow mustaches for [...] "Movember". He says he is doing this to support the cure for prostate cancer but is actually using it for a chance to socialize more with the office, to no avail. Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) later shows Erin <b>his</b> <b>mustache,</b> but she finds it repulsive. He shaves it off shortly after that.|$|E
500|$|Developing and {{maintaining}} his publicity became a constant job, and received {{more of his}} attention as his fame grew. Keeping his alcohol addiction secret, maintaining the persona of a simple rural poet and a friendly common person became most important. Riley identified these traits {{as the basis of}} his popularity during the mid-1880s, and wrote of his need to maintain a fictional persona. He encouraged the stereotype by authoring poetry he thought would help build his identity. He was aided by editorials he authored and submitted to the Indianapolis Journal offering observations on events from his perspective as a [...] "humble rural poet". He changed his appearance to look more mainstream, and began by shaving <b>his</b> <b>mustache</b> off and abandoning the flamboyant dress he employed in his early circuit tours.|$|E

Later, at the funeral of Pawnee's celebrity miniature horse Li'l Sebastian, Ron is nearly killed {{as a result of}} Leslie and Ben's affair. When their efforts to hide their relationship accidentally cause Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame to be filled with lighter fluid instead of propane, Ron creates a massive fireball when he lights it, which burns off his eyebrows and part of <b>his</b> <b>mustache.</b> The season ends as a horrified Ron learns that his first ex-wife, Tammy, has arrived to see him; the news is enough to make his second ex-wife, also named Tammy, run away in horror.|$|E

500|$|Bordagaray {{showed up}} at spring {{training}} in 1936 with a mustache, which he grew for a bit role in The Prisoner of Shark Island, filmed during the offseason. This was scandalous, as baseball players {{were expected to be}} clean shaven at the time; the last player believed to have worn a mustache was Wally Schang during the 1914 season. Looking for stories to write about, sportswriters for the Dodgers encouraged Bordagaray to grow out <b>his</b> <b>mustache</b> and goatee. The Brooklyn Eagle hosted a contest to determine what sort of beard Bordagaray should grow. After a few months, Dodgers manager Casey Stengel made him shave, saying [...] "If anyone's going to be a clown on this club, it's going to be me." [...] Mustaches would not be seen in MLB again until Oakland Athletics owner Charlie O. Finley paid his players to grow facial hair in the 1970s. Finley hosted a [...] "mustache day", and invited Bordagaray to serve as master of ceremonies.|$|E
500|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, three deleted {{scenes from}} [...] "Sister City" [...] were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. In the first 100-second clip, Ron talks about his hatred for socialism, and Raul says he fears Ron because of <b>his</b> <b>mustache,</b> which he said makes him [...] "cower in fear" [...] (repeatedly saying the word 'mustache'). In the second minute-long clip, Raul discusses the medals he received for his parks-related accomplishments, including [...] "doing away with people making speeches in the parks", [...] "organizing the garbage so it's not all over the place" [...] and [...] "looking at the leaves". In the third 100-second clip, Raul and the Venezuelans question why Leslie {{does not have a}} giant oil painting of herself in her office. After his final argument with Leslie, Tom refuses to follow Raul's orders to open the door for him, and Raul has trouble opening it because [...] "it's been a while since I've done this".|$|E
500|$|... "Ron & Tammy: Part Two" [...] {{received}} highly positive reviews, {{with several}} commentators praising the repairing of Ron and Tammy, Nick Offerman's performance and, in particular, {{the line in}} which Ron explains how part of <b>his</b> <b>mustache</b> became shaved off: [...] "It rubbed off... from friction." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said she feared Megan Mullally could {{not live up to}} her performance in [...] "Ron and Tammy", but she said the follow-up episode [...] "gave Parks and Rec fans everything they could hope for and more". Busis also praised the pairing of the enthusiastic Chris and the apathetic April. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix enjoyed that the script did not simply rehash the original [...] "Ron and Tammy" [...] story, but instead played it well off the Tom, Wendy and Ron love triangle. Sepinwall also praised the Chris/April pairing and the fact that Adam Scott got to do more than play his usual straight man role. He added that he hoped each season would have a Ron and Tammy-centric episode, but limit it to once a year in the style of Cheers Bar Wars episodes.|$|E

Leslie confronts Tammy, who admits to the plot and brags that this is how the library operates. Leslie tries to get Ron to break up with Tammy, but he insists he cannot confront her without Leslie's help. The two go to the library, where Ron starts to cave in when Tammy flirts with him. Leslie tells Ron to do whatever will make him happy, even if it means giving up the lot. Ron, impressed that anyone would put his own needs before their own, decides instead to break up with Tammy and give the lot back to Leslie. After breaking the news to Tammy off-camera, he leaves the library with a push-pin stuck in his forehead, and part of <b>his</b> <b>mustache</b> missing, and he and Leslie flee the library. The two share a drink, where Leslie encourages Ron to insult Tammy.|$|E
500|$|Since his {{appearance}} in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, Wario {{has become a}} well-established mascot for Nintendo, and he has received a largely positive reception. Nintendo Power described Wario as a [...] "pretty uncool dude" [...] which they [...] "cannot help but like." [...] They also listed <b>his</b> <b>mustache</b> {{as one of the}} best in Nintendo games. Computer and Video Games found the levity of Wario's games [...] "liberating" [...] compared to big Nintendo franchises such as Mario and The Legend of Zelda.

[...] IGN editor Travis Fahs comments that while Wario is not the most likeable character, his strong confidence overshadows his flaws and makes him entertaining. The website later ranked Wario 31st in a list of the [...] "Top 100 Videogame Villains". In the book A Parent's Guide to Nintendo Games: A Comprehensive Look at the Systems and the Games, Craig Wessel described Wario as a [...] "sinister twist" [...] on Mario.
