40|$|Chronic rhinosinusitis is {{characterized}} by nasal purulence accompanied by malaise, postnasal drip and nasal dryness or crusting. It is a condition that {{is very difficult to}} treat and can be very disabling to the patients. A clinical diagnosis is based on history and evaluation with endoscopy, and computerized tomographic scanning. The etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis is multifactorial and comprises a vicious cycle of pathophysiological, anatomical, and constitutive factors. Predisposing factors include ciliary impairment, allergy, nasal polyposis, and immune deficiency. Treatment is aimed at reducing mucosal inflammation and swelling, controlling infection, and restoring aeration of the nasal and sinus mucosa. The choice of treatment is influenced by many factors including past medication, duration of symptoms and the presence of allergy/nasal polyps. Pharmacologic treatment, with local or systemic corticosteroids such as mometasone <b>furoate,</b> <b>fluticasone</b> propionate, beclometasone dipropionate or oral prednisolone coupled with nasal lavage with isotonic saline solutions are the cornerstones of disease management. Systemic antibiotics including amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) are often administered to patients with chronic sinusitis and underlying bacterial infection. In patients with underlying allergy, additional treatment with antihistamines should be considered. Aeration of the sinuses may temporarily be improved with local nasal decongestants such as oxymetazoline. If symptoms persist after aggressive medical treatment, surgery should be considered. Surgery should be functional and involve widening the natural drainage openings of the sinuses and preserving the ciliated epithelium as much as possible. In the case of nasal polyposis surgery is more aggressive involving removal of the diseased polypous mucosa. It is recommended that medical treatment should be continued post sinus surger...|$|R

The study objective {{was to determine the}} impact of medication adherence and asthma control on resource use and charges in mild asthmatic patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). Research design and methods: A claims database was analyzed retrospectively from October 2001 &ndash;December 2007 to identify mild asthmatic patients aged 12 &ndash; 65 years who began ICS treatment. Demographics, drug utilization, and resource use for each patient were identified for the 365 -day period before and after the index date (pre-index and post-index periods, respectively). Patients were designated as having high control high adherence (HCHA) or low control low adherence (LCLA) based on post-index exacerbations and the percentage of days covered; not all patients who qualified for study inclusion met adherence designation requirements. Differences between the HCHA and LCLA cohorts in resource use (eg, asthma treatment days) and asthma-related treatment charges were assessed. Results: Compared with the HCHA cohort (n = 483), the LCLA cohort (n = 258) had more asthma treatment days (2. 9 vs 3. 9, respectively; P &lt; 0. 0001) and higher overall asthma treatment charges ($ 2655 vs $ 3345, respectively; P &lt; 0. 0001) in the post-index period. An adjusted odds ratio suggested that patients receiving mometasone furoate (MF) were approximately 5 times more likely to belong to the HCHA cohort than patients receiving any other ICS (P &lt; 0. 0001). Conclusions: Better asthma control and adherence to prescribed ICSs are associated with lower asthma-related resource use and charges. Mild asthmatic patients receiving MF {{were more likely to be}} in the HCHA cohort than patients receiving other ICSs, perhaps due to the once-daily dosing of MF. Current NAEPP guidelines recommend low-dose ICS monotherapy for mild persistent asthma; thus, it is critical to optimize mild persistent asthma control and limit unnecessary resource use and charges.

40|$|Abstract <b>Fluticasone</b> <b>furoate</b> (FF) – USAN {{approved}} name, a new topically active glucocorticoid {{has been}} recently identified. The {{aim of this}} study was to characterise the binding affinity of this compound to the human lung glucocorticoid receptor in relation to other glucocorticoids. Additionally, we sought to determine the binding behaviour of <b>fluticasone</b> <b>furoate</b> to human lung tissue. The glucocorticoid receptor binding kinetics of <b>fluticasone</b> <b>furoate</b> revealed a remarkably fast association and a slow dissociation resulting in a relative receptor affinity (RRA) of 2989 ± 135 with reference to dexamethasone (RRA: 100 ± 5). Thus, the RRA of FF exceeds the RRAs of all currently clinically used corticosteroids such as mometasone furoate (MF; RRA 2244), fluticasone propionate (FP; RRA 1775), ciclesonide's active metabolite (RRA 1212 – rat receptor data) or budesonide (RRA 855). FP and FF displayed pronounced retention in human lung tissue in vitro. Lowest tissue binding was found for MF. There was no indication of instability or chemical modification of FF in human lung tissue. These advantageous binding attributes may contribute to a highly efficacious profile for FF as a topical treatment for inflammatory disorders of the respiratory tract. </p...|$|E

Controlling asthma symptoms and preventing acute exacerbations have been the foundation of care. Using long-term controller treatments such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and inhaled long-acting beta 2 -agonists (LABAs) is a common approach. While patient responses to recommended pharmacotherapy may vary, poor adherence to therapy also contributes to poor asthma control. A once-daily combination inhaler, such as <b>fluticasone</b> <b>furoate,</b> an ICS, in combination with vilanterol, a LABA, offers increased convenience and potential improved adherence, which should result in enhanced clinical outcomes and reduced exacerbations.

40|$|Background The {{pathogenesis}} of non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) {{is still}} largely unknown. Furthermore, {{it is unclear}} whether there is a correlation between the effect of nasal glucocorticoids on nasal inflammation and on nasal symptoms and quality of life. Methods In this pilot study we recruited 12 healthy subjects and 24 patients with recently diagnosed persistent NAR [12 untreated and 12 under regular treatment with nasal <b>fluticasone</b> <b>furoate</b> (two sprays of 27. 5 µg each in each nostril once daily, total daily dose= 110 µg) for at least 20 days]. Each subject filled a mini rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (mini RQLQ). Nasal scrapings were obtained from each subject and used to prepare slides for Diff-Quik and immunocytochemical staining for inflammatory and epithelial cells count, MUC 5 AC expression and the general pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor B (NF-B) activation. Results The nasal score of the mini RQLQ, the number of nasal inflammatory cells (neutrophils, eosinophils) and the number of goblet cells are significantly higher in untreated patients with persistent NAR compared with control subjects and treated NAR patients. The percentage of MUC 5 AC+ nasal epithelial cells is significantly increased in untreated patients with persistent NAR compared with the control subjects (41. 8 ± 6. 4 vs 22. 3 ± 4. 8, respectively; p= 0. 0403) without significant differences between control subjects and patients with persistent NAR on regular <b>fluticasone</b> <b>furoate</b> treatment with nasal glucocorticoids (33. 9 ± 5. 0 %; p= 0. 0604) nor between the 2 groups of persistent NAR subjects (p= 0. 3260).

40|$|Purpose: Exercise induced airway {{obstruction}} {{is defined}} as an acute, reversible bronchial obstruction occurring immediately after physical exercise. Exercise induced airway obstruction is a common manifestation {{in children and adolescents}} with asthma and is associated with an impaired quality of life. Childhood asthma is characterized by chronic inflammation of the lower airways and often accompanied by allergies. Another important manifestation of allergy is allergic rhinitis, which is an inflammatory disorder of the upper airways, highly prevalent in asthmatic children. Allergic rhinitis and asthma are therefore recognized as manifestations of a single syndrome. The aim of the study is to investigate whether treatment of allergic rhinitis with an intra-nasal corticosteroid protects against airway obstruction after exercise in cold air. Methods: 44 children, aged 12 - 17 years, with a history of allergic asthma were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the pediatric department of the Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede and were screened for inclusion in the study. Included patients were treated for 3 weeks ± 5 days with <b>fluticasone</b> <b>furoate</b> (Avamys®) or placebo. Before and after treatment they underwent an exercise provocation challenge. The change in exercise induced fall of FEV 1 after treatment was analyzed. Furthermore changes in asthma control score (ACQ), quality of life and fraction of the exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were analyzed. Study design: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled prospective study. Results: 32 Patients were included, 25 completed the study. Exercise induced fall of FEV 1 was significantly reduced (p< 0. 01) in the <b>fluticasone</b> <b>furoate</b> group, whereas no significant changes were observed in the placebo group.

40|$|BACKGROUND The eye is {{especially}} {{susceptible to the}} symptoms of allergic rhinitis, itching (pruritus), tearing (epiphora) and redness (erythema) because it lacks a mechanical barrier that could prevent the deposition of allergens, such as pollen on the conjunctival surface. These ocular symptoms {{have been described as}} examples of the type 1 immediate hypersensitivity reaction. A number of recently published clinical studies apparently support the positive effect of intranasal steroidal sprays on ocular allergy symptoms. The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of intranasal steroids in relieving ocular symptoms in allergic rhinitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS 60 subjects who had seasonal allergic rhinitis with ocular symptoms came to Outpatient Department of Chalmeda Anand Rao Hospital in the year 2015 - 2016. Randomly, each intranasal steroid is given to 12 patients to a total of 60 patients for 4 weeks 2 puffs in each nostril twice daily and the clinical response is observed.

40|$|Background: <b>Fluticasone</b> <b>furoate</b> {{nasal spray}} (FFNS) is a {{glucocorticoid}} {{developed for the}} treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). This study aimed to assess the safety, efficacy, and systemic exposure of FFNS in Japanese children with perennial AR (PAR). Methods: In this multicentre, open-label, phase 3 study, 61 children aged 2 to < 15 years were treated with FFNS 55  μg, once daily for 12 weeks. Nasal and ocular symptoms were scored by parents/guardians/patients and recorded in a patient's daily diary. In addition, rhinoscopy findings, including mucosal swelling, were scored by the investigators as an efficacy measure. As a safety measure, adverse events and clinical laboratory data were evaluated. Results: An adverse event was reported by 67 % of patients during the treatment and follow-up period, all of which were mild in intensity. The most commonly reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis and acute sinusitis (acute rhinosinusitis). There were no serious adverse events. FFNS 55  μg improved nasal symptom scores and rhinoscopy findings compared with the baseline. Ocular symptom scores were also improved compared with the baseline in FFNS 55  μg in a sub-group of patients with any ocular symptoms at baseline. FFNS 55  μg was shown to be well tolerated over the 12 -week treatment period. Majority of patients receiving FFNS 55  μg had unquantifiable plasma levels of <b>fluticasone</b> <b>furoate</b> (FF). Conclusions: Twelve-week treatment with FFNS 55  μg, once daily, is well tolerated and effective with low systemic exposure in Japanese children aged 2 to < 15 years with PAR...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} funded by GlaxoSmithKline 3 Abstract (177 words) Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) often coexists with other chronic diseases and comorbidities that can markedly influence patients ’ health status and prognosis. This is particularly true for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, {{there have been no}} trials assessing the effect of COPD medications on CVD in patients with both diseases. The “Study to Understand Mortality and MorbidITy in COPD ” (SUMMIT) aims at determining the impact of <b>Fluticasone</b> <b>Furoate</b> / Vilanterol combination (FF/VI), and the individual components on the survival of patients with moderate COPD and either a history of CVD or at increased risk for CVD. SUMMIT is a multi-center, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial o...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case of {{iatrogenic}} Cushing’s syndrome, induced by treatment with <b>fluticasone</b> <b>furoate</b> (1 – 2 dd, 27. 5 μg in each nostril) in a pediatric patient treated for congenital HIV. The pediatric patient described in this case report is a young girl of African descent, treated for congenital HIV with a combination therapy of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (1 dd 320 / 80 mg), Lamivudine (1 dd 160 mg) and Abacavir (1 dd 320 mg). Our pediatric patient presented with typical Cushingoid features (i. e. striae of the upper legs, full moon face, increased body and facial hair) within weeks after starting <b>fluticasone</b> <b>furoate</b> therapy, which was exacerbated after increasing the dose to 2 dd because of complaints of unresolved rhinitis. Biochemical analysis fitted iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome, with a repeatedly low cortisol (< 0. 03 μM, ref 0. 14 – 0. 60 μM) and low ACTH (9 pg/mL, ref 9 – 52 pg/mL) without signs of adrenal insufficiency. No other biochemical abnormalities that could point to adrenal or pituitary dysfunction were detected; electrolytes, thyroid and gonadal function, and IGF- 1 were within the normal range. Pharmacogenetic analysis revealed that the pediatric patient carried the CYP 3 A 4 * 1 B/* 1 G and CYP 3 A 5 * 3 /* 3 genotype (associated with a partial and complete loss of enzyme activity, respectively) which {{is associated with the}} development of iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome in patients treated for HIV due to the strong inhibition of CYP 3 enzymes by Ritonavir. Upon discontinuation of fluticasone treatment, the pediatric patient improved both clinically and biochemically with normalisation of cortisol and ACTH within a couple of weeks...|$|E
40|$|Allergic {{diseases}} {{are getting more}} and more widespread pathology. Among them, allergic rhinitis is the most «harmless» and prognostically favorable. However, recent studies show that this disease not only significantly degrades the life quality of the children violates the cognitive function, but is a risk factor for asthma. In this connection, a special importance is attached to the adequate symptoms of allergic rhinitis control and to minimizing the adverse effects of drugs used. The article presents the results of numerous studies of the efficacy and safety of one of the drugs for the allergic rhinitis treatment, i. e. intranasal corticosteroids representative of the group — <b>fluticasone</b> <b>furoate.</b> Key words: allergic diseases, allergic rhinitis, treatment, intranasal corticosteroids, the efficacy, safety, children. </strong...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{allergic}} rhinitis (SAR) is increasing in prevalence such that 1 in 4 persons is affected in the UK. It represents a considerable {{burden of disease}} since in {{a significant proportion of}} individuals the severity of nasal–ocular symptoms has an important effect on daily activity, performance and quality of life. Intranasal steroids (INS) form the mainstay of treatment, having been shown in meta-analyses to be superior to oral antihistamines, intranasal antihistamines and anti-leukotrienes. Fluticasone propionate is an established INS for the treatment of rhinitis, including SAR. Its favorable pharmacological profile combining high local efficacy with low systemic bioavailability has established fluticasone propionate as an effective intervention. The more recent introduction of structurally related <b>fluticasone</b> <b>furoate</b> with similar but enhanced pharmacological characteristics with a novel delivery device may confer further therapeutic advantages...|$|E
40|$|Maintenance therapies for asthma are {{typically}} delivered via handheld inhalers. Poor adherence to inhaled medications and incorrect inhaler technique {{are known to}} adversely affect outcomes in asthma, contributing to the continuing failure for many patients to achieve control despite the availability of effective therapies. 1 The ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler (DPI) is a handheld inhaler with single-step activation, featuring a cover that is opened by the patient to uncover the mouthpiece and activate a dose 2 (ELLIPTA is a trademark of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies). The actuated dose is subsequently inhaled from the mouthpiece. 2 The ELLIPTA DPI is used to deliver <b>fluticasone</b> <b>furoate</b> (FF), a new inhaled corticosteroid licensed in Europe in combination with vilanterol, a new long-acting β 2 -agonist, for asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} and in development as a mono...|$|E
