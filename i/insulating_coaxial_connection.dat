With the help of numerical optimization, {{it is possible to}} obtain electrical resistances significantly lower than those of a heavy-gauge copper wire or litz wire in the 2 – 20 MHz range. Moreover, much of the reduction in resistance can be achieved for just a few shells; in contrast, litz wire would need to contain ∼ 10 [superscript 4] strands to perform comparably in this frequency range...|$|R

Important design considerations for a transmission line operating on the lunar surface are mass, temperature, and efficiency.

The electrical and thermal models developed are used to calculate transmission line mass, size, and temperature as a function of voltage, geometry, waveform, location, and efficiency. The analyses include ac and dc for above and below ground operation.

40|$|The {{reverse current}} tends {{to occur in}} the {{transition}} region of the guiding magnetic field in a magnetically <b>insulated</b> <b>coaxial</b> diode (MICD). Influence of the guiding magnetic field on characteristics of the MICD especially on the reverse current is studied by the particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation in this paper. The reverse current is confirmed to be irrelevant with the guiding magnetic field strength. However, the reverse current is clarified quantitatively to depend on the electric and magnetic field distribution in the upstream of the cathode tip. As the MICD has been widely employed in microwave tubes, a simple approach to suppress the reverse current on the premise of little change of the original diode is valuable and thus proposed. The optimum matching point between the cathode and the magnetic field is selected in consideration of the entrance depth tolerance, the diode impedance discrepancy and the reverse current coefficient...|$|R

The cylinder is immersed vertically. The numerical results are in good agreement with the temperature at the wall of the container. The experimental temperature measurement of the thermocouple located inside the probe is intermediate between the numerical temperatures on the axis and {{on the surface of the}} probe. The natural convection phenomenon is evidenced in the experiments, after a certain time from the beginning of heating, in some of the liquids used, except glycerol.

40|$|The tether and/or {{transmission}} line connecting the SP- 100 to space station presents some unorthodox challenges in high voltage engineering, power transmission, and distribution. The line, which {{doubles as a}} structural element of this unusual spacecraft, will convey HVDC from SP- 100 to the platform in low Earth orbit, and environment where the local plasma is sufficient to cause breakdown of exposed conductors at potentials {{of only a few}} hundred volts. Its anticipated several years operation, and continuously accumulating exposure to meteoroids and debris, raises an increasing likelihood that mechanical damage, including perforation, will be sustained in service. The present concept employs an array of gas insulated solid wall aluminum coaxial tubes; a conceptual design which showed basic feasibility of the SP- 100 powered space station. Practical considerations of launch, deployment and assembly have lead to investigation of reel deployable, dielectric <b>insulated</b> <b>coaxial</b> cables.

50|$|From the Optical Network Terminal (ONT) at the {{subscriber}} premises, the RF {{video is}} typically delivered with a <b>coaxial</b> <b>connection</b> to a FiOS set-top box that handles both RF and IPTV video. Interactive {{services such as}} VOD and widgets are delivered by IP and are only accessible through use of a FiOS set-top box and a Verizon/Frontier-supplied router. The router supports multimedia (MOCA) and provides the set-top boxes with programming guides and all SD channels, but high definition content (beyond local HD channels which are in clear QAM) requires HD equipment like a FiOS HD set-top box/DVR or a CableCARD-supporting device, such as TiVo. In 2008, Verizon ceased carrying analog television signals in parallel with digital channels, meaning televisions without a QAM tuner or a set-top digital adapter received no signal.|$|R
50|$|The APC-7 {{connector}} (also {{referred to}} as a 7 mm connector) is a precision coaxial connector used on laboratory microwave test equipment for frequencies up to 18 GHz. APC-7 connectors are advantageous because they have a low-reflection coefficient, make repeatable <b>coaxial</b> <b>connections,</b> and are genderless. The connectors are expensive, so they are seldom used outside the laboratory where their cost can be justified by their accuracy and convenience. Due to their high cost, their 18 GHz frequency limitation, and new laboratory practices, the connectors are now uncommon. Modern low frequency microwave equipment often uses the less expensive 3.5 mm (26.5 GHz) connector. Higher frequency equipment must use higher performance connectors such as the 2.92 mm (40 GHz), 2.4 mm (50 GHz), 1.85 mm (67 GHz), or 1.0 mm (110 GHz) connectors.|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{effort has}} gone into {{developing}} polymer formulations and cable designs to minimize failures through water tree growth. However, diagnostic techniques still are required to enable the estimation {{of the level of}} damage present within a service cable. This paper reports on progress regarding the application of dielectric spectroscopy to cable diagnostics. A 40 kV, crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) <b>insulated</b> <b>coaxial</b> cable was used as a model power cable. Sample lengths were immersed in a potassium chloride solution and some of these were subjected to AC electrical stress. After an 8 week duration, a high density of tress was found in the electrically stressed cable. Dielectric spectra have been measured for both sample types in the frequency range of 10 - 5 to 105 Hz. Insertion loss measurements were also carried out in the frequency range of 3 × 10 5 to 3 × 109 Hz. From both types of measurement, it was possible to distinguish between the cables containing water trees and those that were free from water tree structures. These approaches could therefore be developed in order to provide diagnostics for the detection of water tree damage in electrical power cables...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{technique}} and a nonthermal soldering method {{to improve the}} performance of AgHT- 8 transparent polymer antennas are proposed in this letter.

50|$|ZiU-5 is a high-floor big class {{trolleybus}} {{for city}} mass transit. It's duraluminium hull {{mounted on the}} steel frame and carcass constructions. The hull has two doors in its front and rear ends. The doors open and close automatically by electric gear under driver's control. The vehicle is powered by DK-207A 95-kilowatt electric motor. The current regulation system (controller unit) is an automatic indirect one. All commutation of power-circuit resistors is performed by a low-voltage electric servomotor. These resistors limit the electric current through the main motor and, therefore, regulate its speed and torque. ZiU-5 is equipped with motor-generator for transformation of the input DC high voltage (550V) to low service DC voltage of 24V. This transformation is quite simple - 550V electric motor has <b>coaxial</b> <b>connection</b> with 24V electric generator. However, the drawback of this simplicity is a constant noise of this device. However good oilment and centring procedures can reduce this noise to tolerant level. The low voltage subsystem includes mentioned above controller unit, internal and external lights, door gear and two accumulator batteries. Due to differentiating voltage levels the hazard of electric shock to driver and passengers was reduced greatly. All electric devices inside passengers' saloon and driver cabin are supplied only with safe 24V voltage. Power 550V circuits are placed under the floor. The brake system includes electrodynamic, mechanical and pneumatic brakes. The pneumatic brake has the electric compressor unit to maintain the pressure in air reservoirs.|$|R
5000|$|Most cable {{companies}} require a set-top box to view their cable channels, even on newer televisions with digital cable QAM tuners, because most digital cable channels are now encrypted, or [...] "scrambled", to reduce cable service theft. A cable from the {{jack in the}} wall {{is attached to the}} input of the box, and an output cable from the box is attached to the television, usually the RF-IN or composite input on older TVs. Since the set-top box only decodes the single channel that is being watched, each television in the house requires a separate box. Some unencrypted channels, usually traditional over-the-air broadcast networks, can be displayed without a receiver box. The cable company will provide set top boxes based on the level of service a customer purchases, from basic set top boxes with a standard definition picture connected through the standard <b>coaxial</b> <b>connection</b> on the TV, to high-definition wireless DVR receivers connected via HDMI or component. Older analog television sets are [...] "cable ready" [...] and can receive the old analog cable without a set-top box. To receive digital cable channels on an analog television set, even unencrypted ones, requires a different type of box, a digital television adapter supplied by the cable company.

40|$|An angular {{acceleration}} sensor {{can be used}} for the dynamic analysis of human and joint motions. In this paper, an {{angular acceleration}} sensor with novel structure based on the principle of electromagnetic induction is designed. The method involves the construction of a constant magnetic field by the excitation windings of sensor, and the cup-shaped rotor that cut the magnetic field. The output windings of the sensor generate an electromotive force, which is directly proportional to the angular acceleration through the electromagnetic coupling when the rotor has rotational angular acceleration. The mechanical structure and the magnetic working circuit of the sensor are described. The output properties and the mathematical model including the transfer function and state-space model of the sensor are established. The asymptotical stability of the sensor when it is working is verified by the Lyapunov Theorem. An angular acceleration calibration device based on the torsional pendulum principle is designed. The method involves the <b>coaxial</b> <b>connection</b> of the angular acceleration sensor, torsion pendulum and a high-precision angle sensor, and then an initial external force is applied to the torsion pendulum to produce a periodic damping angle oscillation. The angular acceleration sensor and the angle sensor will generate two corresponding electrical signals. The sensitivity coefficient of the angular acceleration sensor can be obtained after processing these two-channel signals. The experiment results show that the sensitivity coefficient of the sensor is about 17. 29 mv/Krad·s 2. Finally, the errors existing in the practical applications of the sensor are discussed and the corresponding improvement measures are proposed to provide effective technical support for the practical promotion of the novel sensor...|$|R

An <b>insulated</b> microwave <b>coaxial</b> antenna was introduced inside a 1000 ml glass flask containing dry Laurus nobilis L. leaves and tap water. Microwave power up to 800 Wat 2450 MHz was emitted in continuous wave regime (CW) or in pulsed regime (PR) at 8 kW peak power. Stirring with a magnetic bar and a Clevenger refrigerator connected to the flask enabled to complete the extraction in 1 h. The results of the in situ microwave extraction were compared with those obtained by heating the same reactor with a conventional electric mantle by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. Differences were observed both in the composition of the essential oil and from the energetic point of view. The essential oil obtained with microwave (MW) methods contained substantially higher amounts of oxygenated compounds and lower amounts of monoterpenes than conventional method. The in situ microwave heating is safe and versatile; it presents time and energy saving advantages, and therefore it can be considered useful also for industrial application...|$|R

50|$|As a {{transmission}} line, transmission efficiency will be maximum when {{the impedance of}} the antenna, the characteristic impedance of the twin-lead line and the impedance of the equipment are the same. For this reason, when attaching a twin-lead line to a <b>coaxial</b> cable <b>connection,</b> such as the 300 ohm twin-lead from a domestic television antenna to the television's 75 ohm coax antenna input, a balun with a 4:1 ratio is commonly used. Its purpose is double: first, it transforms twin-lead's 300 ohm impedance to match the 75 ohm coaxial cable impedance; and second, it transforms the balanced, symmetric transmission line to the unbalanced coax input. In general, when used as a feedline, twin-lead (especially ladder line versions) has a higher efficiency than coaxial cable {{when there is an}} impedance mismatch between the feedline and the source (or sink). For receive-only use this merely implies that the system can communicate under slightly less optimal conditions; for transmit use, this can often result in significantly less energy lost as heat in the transmission line.|$|R
