5|$|A {{modus vivendi}} had been {{achieved}} between Warwick {{and the king}} for some months, but the restoration of Henry Percy to Montagu's earldom of Northumberland prevented any chance of full reconciliation.

Albani had been elected on the feast day of Pope Clement I, and took the name of Clement XI to honour the saint. At fifty-one, Albani was younger than any other pope who had been elected in almost two centuries.

Others have suggested that he chose this early appearance in the film {{in order to avoid}} distracting the audience.|$|E

He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E
