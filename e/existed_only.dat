At 1200 UTC, the depression was declared extratropical, and it continued northward until dissipating near California a day later. Moisture from the system persisted as it passed through the state and the Pacific Northwest, ultimately merging with a larger extratropical cyclone involving the remnants of Hurricane Guillermo.|$|E

5|$|Wigner led the Theoretical Group at the Metallurgical Laboratory that {{included}} Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Gale Young and Edward Creutz. The group's {{task was to}} design the production nuclear reactors that would convert uranium into plutonium. At the time, reactors <b>existed</b> <b>only</b> on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. In July 1942, Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design, with a graphite neutron moderator and water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial at the time. Water was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium or liquid metal as a coolants would delay the project.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} Arbeideren went defunct, the Communist Party gave {{its name to}} a new {{newspaper}}, which was set up as the new main newspaper of the Communist Party in 1930. This new paper was based in Oslo as the replacement of Norges Kommunistblad, which had been liquidated as well. Olav Larssen and Evald Solbakken found a new outlet in Hamar Arbeiderblad, which {{had been set up}} as the new Hamar organ of the Labour Party in 1925. The Communist Party later tried to create a weekly newspaper in Hamar, Rød Front, but it was short-lived and <b>existed</b> <b>only</b> between 1932 and 1933. The Oslo version of Arbeideren went defunct in 1940, and many years after that, the name was used from 1951 to 1953 for a third newspaper, published in Brumunddal, not far from Hamar city.|$|E
5|$|According to musicologist Francis Maes, Rubinstein {{could not}} be accused of any lack of artistic integrity. He fought for change and {{progress}} in musical life in Russia. Only his musical tastes were conservative—from Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven to the early Romantics up to Chopin. Liszt and Wagner were not included. Neither did he welcome many ideas then new about music, including the role of nationalism in classical music. For Rubinstein, national music <b>existed</b> <b>only</b> in folk song and folk dance. There {{was no place for}} national music in larger works, especially not in opera. Rubinstein's public reaction to the attacks was simply not to react. His classes and concerts were well attended, so he felt no reply was actually necessary. He even forbade his students to take sides.|$|E

5|$|Actinium {{is found}} only in traces in uranium ores – one tonne of uranium in ore {{contains}} about 0.2 milligrams of 227Ac – and in thorium ores, which contain about 5 nanograms of 228Ac per one tonne of thorium. The actinium isotope 227Ac is a transient member of the uranium-actinium series decay chain, which begins with the parent isotope 235U (or 239Pu) and ends with the stable lead isotope 207Pb. The isotope 228Ac is a transient member of the thorium series decay chain, which begins with the parent isotope 232Th and ends with the stable lead isotope 208Pb. Another actinium isotope (225Ac) was transiently present in the neptunium series decay chain, beginning with 237Np (or 233U) and ending with thallium (205Tl) and near-stable bismuth (209Bi), but this chain <b>existed</b> <b>only</b> in the early Solar System, due to the short half-life of neptunium-237.|$|E
5|$|At Governor William Dennison's request, Garfield {{deferred}} {{his military}} ambitions {{to remain in}} the legislature, where he helped appropriate the funds to raise and equip Ohio's volunteer regiments. Afterward, the legislature adjourned and Garfield spent the spring and early summer on a speaking tour of northeastern Ohio, encouraging enlistment in the new regiments. Following a trip to Illinois to purchase muskets, Garfield returned to Ohio and, in August 1861, received a commission as a colonel in the 42nd Ohio Infantry regiment. The 42nd Ohio <b>existed</b> <b>only</b> on paper, so Garfield's first task was to fill its ranks. He did so quickly, recruiting many of his neighbors and former students. The regiment traveled to Camp Chase, outside Columbus, Ohio, to complete training. In December, Garfield was ordered to bring the 42nd to Kentucky, where they joined the Army of the Ohio under Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation <b>existed</b> <b>only</b> as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E

5|$|Politics in Belgium under Leopold I were {{polarized}} between {{liberal and}} Catholic political factions, though before 1847 they collaborated in unionist governments. The liberals {{were opposed to}} the church and particularly opposed its influence in politics and society, while supporting free trade, personal liberties and secularization. The Catholics saw religious teachings as a fundamental basis for the state and society and opposed all attempts by the liberals to attack the church's official privileges. Initially, these factions <b>existed</b> <b>only</b> as informal groups with which prominent politicians were generally identified. The liberals held power over much of Leopold I's reign. An official Liberal Party was formed in 1846, although a formal Catholic Party was only established in 1869. Gradually, these political groups would also spread into Belgium's society, creating a process of social stratification known as pillarisation. Leopold, who was Protestant, tended to favor Liberals and shared their desire for reform, though he was not partisan.|$|E
5|$|The CM Division was {{responsible}} for the purification and fabrication of materials for the bomb, including the core, tamper and initiator. The chemistry and metallurgy of uranium was fairly well known, although it did yield a few surprises, but that of plutonium was almost completely unknown. The element had only been discovered a short time before, and <b>existed</b> <b>only</b> in microgram amounts. Educated guesses about its chemistry tended to be wrong, and as research progressed it was found to have unusual properties, including no less than six allotropes. There was rivalry between its discoverers, with Wahl and Kennedy's group at Los Alamos competing with Seaborg's in Chicago to produce the best process for purifying the metal. This competition ended abruptly when Segrè's group at Los Alamos discovered that high levels of a hitherto undiscovered plutonium-240 isotope in reactor-produced plutonium meant that an implosion-type nuclear weapon was required, and a high degree of purity was therefore unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The Eighth Army {{headquarters}} at Nablus was abandoned at 15:00 on 21 September, when Jevad join the Seventh Army headquarters, {{accompanied by his}} chief of staff and some staff officers. This move signalled the end of the Ottoman Eighth Army. The 20th and 21st Regiments <b>existed</b> <b>only</b> until the afternoon. All surviving remnants were in retreat and threatened with encirclement, including the Asia Corps. Von Oppen with 700 German and 1,300 Ottoman soldiers of the 16th and 19th Divisions, was retreating northwards towards Beisan when he learned it had fallen. He decided to advance during the night of 22 September to Samakh where he correctly guessed Liman von Sanders would order a rearguard action. However, Jevad, (also known as Jevat Pasa and Cevat Pasa) the commander of the Eighth Army ordered him to cross the Jordan River.|$|E

5|$|This {{system of}} limited {{suffrage}} caused the predominantly Polish landowning class {{to dominate the}} Diet. Whilst they only made up about 0.4% of the population, they held 28.2% of {{the seats in the}} Diet. Small-scale rural landowners, on the other hand, made up about 95% of the population, but held only 52.3% of the seats in Diet. This system also skewed representation for different ethnicities in the Diet. Whilst Ruthenians made up about 40% of the population of Galicia, they only held 15% of the seats in the Diet, as they lived primarily in rural communities. Reform of the suffrage system in late 1913 added a fifth curia for the upper peasantry, which had the right to elect twenty deputies. Due to the outbreak of the First World War, no further elections to the Diet took place, and hence the fifth curia <b>existed</b> <b>only</b> on paper.|$|E

Working seven days a week, the group designed the reactors between September 1942 and January 1943. Creutz studied the corrosion of metals in a water-cooled system, and designed the cooling system. In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.|$|E
5|$|During the 1650s, Ashmole {{devoted a}} great deal of energy to the study of alchemy. In 1650, he {{published}} Fasciculus Chemicus under the anagrammatic pseudonym James Hasolle. This work was an English translation of two Latin alchemical works, one by Arthur Dee, the son of John Dee. In 1652, he published his most important alchemical work, Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum, an extensively annotated compilation of metaphysical poems in English. The book preserved and made available many works that had previously <b>existed</b> <b>only</b> in privately held manuscripts. A corrected edition using Ashmole's two errata sheets and the additional chapter seven of a piece by Thomas Charnock was published in 2011. There is little evidence that Ashmole conducted his own alchemical experiments. He {{appears to have been a}} collector of alchemical writings and a student of alchemy rather than an active practitioner, and refers to himself as a pupil of William Backhouse. His final alchemical publication was The Way to Bliss in 1658, but thereafter his interest seems to wane in favour of his other pursuits. Ashmole promoted the use of therapeutic remedies drawing on both Galenic and Paracelsian principles, and his works attempt to merge the two schools. The Way to Bliss recommends ways to prevent illness: a balanced diet, moderate exercise and enough sleep. His works were avidly studied by other natural philosophers, such as Isaac Newton.|$|E

5|$|Gathering, {{hunting and}} fishing were still {{essential}} as sources of food and materials such as hide or fur. The forest was also exploited {{as a source of}} building materials such as wood. In addition, wild forest bees were kept there, and the forest {{could be used as a}} place of refuge. Until the 9th century, the population was separated from the main centers of civilization and self-sufficient with primitive, local community and household-based manufacturing. Specialized craftsmen <b>existed</b> <b>only</b> in the fields of iron extraction from ore and processing, and pottery; the few luxury items used were imports. From the 7th century on, modestly decorated ceramics were made with the potter's wheel. 7th– to 9th-century collections of objects have been found in Bonikowo and Bruszczewo, Kościan County (iron spurs, knives, clay containers with some ornamentation) and in the Kraków-Nowa Huta region (weapons and utensils in Pleszów and Mogiła), among other places. Slavic warriors were traditionally armed with spears, bows and wooden shields. Axes were used later, and still swords of the types popular throughout 7th– to 9th-century Europe were also used. Independent of distant powers, the Slavic tribes in Poland lived a relatively undisturbed life, but at the cost of some backwardness in civilization.|$|E
5|$|This {{marked the}} {{symbolic}} end of Bulgaria {{as an independent}} state, at least in Byzantine eyes. Byzantine generals were installed in the eastern {{parts of the country}} along the Danube. Preslav was renamed Ioannopolis in honour of the emperor, and Dorostolon (or perhaps Pereyaslavets) was renamed Theodoropolis after St. Theodore the Stratelate, who was believed to have intervened in the final battle before Dorostolon. Tzimiskes reduced the Bulgarian patriarchate to an archbishopric subject to the Patriarch of Constantinople. He brought the Bulgarian royal family and many nobles to live in Constantinople and Asia Minor, while the region around Philippopolis was settled with Armenians. However, outside eastern Bulgaria, and there only in the major urban centres, Byzantine control <b>existed</b> <b>only</b> in theory. Tzimiskes, like Nikephoros Phokas, was more interested in the East. With the Rus' threat banished and Bulgaria seemingly pacified, his attention turned to Syria. No coordinated Byzantine drive to secure the interior of the Balkans was made. As a result, the north-central Balkans and Macedonia, where neither the Rus' nor Tzimiskes' troops had ventured, remained as before {{in the hands of the}} local Bulgarian elites.|$|E
5|$|The rubber vine {{could be}} destructively {{harvested}} by cutting up the vine and squeezing out the latex whilst it {{lay on the}} ground. This was quicker and easier than non-destructive harvesting and was practised by villagers who wished to fill their quotas and avoid punishment, especially once supplies of the vine began to run low. In addition some vines were destroyed deliberately by villagers who believed that once the rubber was gone Abir would leave the concession. Because of this destruction all rubber vines within 10km of Basankasu were depleted within 18 months of that post opening. In an attempt to slow the destruction of vines Abir issued orders in 1892 and 1904 which prohibited destructive harvesting methods but these were largely ineffective. In 1896 the Congo Free State ordered Abir to plant 150 rubber trees or vines for each ton of rubber exported to replace destructively harvested vines. This was increased to 500 plants per ton in 1902. By 1903 the plantation at the Bongandanga post held {{more than one million}} plants and by 1904 each Abir post employed around one hundred workers to manage its plantation. Despite this the plantation project was ultimately a failure {{due in part to the}} fact that each Abir agent remained at a post for just two years and was uninterested in working the plantation which would only benefit his successor. Congo Free State forestry officers also noted that Abir plantations were smaller than required or even <b>existed</b> <b>only</b> on paper. Abir would also plant vines which looked similar to the Landolphia vine but did not produce rubber, as a consequence the Free State required them to instead plant the Clitandra vine which was more easily recognisable but did not produce rubber in its first eight years. These vines may never have reached maturity as there is no evidence that these plantations ever produced rubber. In 1904 Abir began to run out of vines to tap and rubber production fell to half of that of 1903, which was 1000 tons. By 1904 rubber vines within 50 miles of Abir posts had been depleting, leading to violent clashes between rival villages over control of the remaining plants. The entirety of the Lulonga concession, to the west of Abir, produced just 7 tons of rubber in 1905.|$|E
