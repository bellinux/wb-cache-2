40|$|Schools of {{education}} increasingly are using contingent faculty mem-bers to instruct students. Contingent <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> bring expertise and knowledge.

To strengthen program infrastructure, the roles and expectations of contingent <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> must be defined clearly and recognized by all school {{of education}} <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> and university administrators. The increased use of nontenured, non-permanent <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> (e. g., adjunct, contingent, or noncore <b>faculty</b> <b>members)</b> in schools of education (SOEs) in American universities (Gappa 2000; American Association of University Professors [AAUP] 2003; Finkelstein 2003) raises questions about how those universities define their educational goals, expertise, and leadership roles.
