40|$|A {{reconnaissance}} survey {{for the presence}} of lymphatic filariasis is made in 41 chiefdoms of north east Ghana. Four disease levels are identified culminating in <b>hyperendemic</b> <b>disease</b> foci associated with two Government-introduced rice irrigation projects. Attention is also drawn to the disease effects of small village dams. Multiple concurrent infections are noted. Within the most stricken irrigation villages, aspects of concealment, stigma and marriage are considered. Failure to control lymphatic filariasis has led to hospital avoidance and neglect of the disease jointly by patients, physicians and nurses. Culpability rests with the irrigation authority and Government health services. An outline is given of possible measures for disease control. A multisectoral policy of 'prevention before development' is strongly advocated. development West Africa irrigation rice lymphatic filariasis...|$|E

Similar successes have been demonstrated using meningococcal vaccines for use against serogroup B (MenB) outbreak strains but the diversity of MenB strains has limited vaccine use outside targeted geographic regions. MenB continues to be a significant cause of outbreaks in adolescents and young adults, as recently demonstrated in university settings in the US (Princeton, New Jersey and Santa Barbara, California) and has the potential for <b>hyperendemic</b> <b>disease</b> levels such as currently experienced in Quebec and the United Kingdom. In adolescents, increased endemic disease rates and outbreak potential are likely associated with social behaviors putting individuals at risk for carriage acquisition and may explain regional and temporal variations in epidemiology. A protein-based, multi-component MenB vaccine (4 CMenB) is currently licensed for use in 37 countries including EU/EEA countries, Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, and the US. In this article we review the most recent clinical trial data with 4 CMenB with a focus on adolescents and young adults. The vaccine appears to have an acceptable safety profile and is well-tolerated in adolescents and young adults while providing robust, persistent levels of bactericidal antibodies considered protective for each of the four antigenic components of the vaccine. With the recent availability of this vaccine, health care providers have the first comprehensive opportunity to control meningococcal disease, a highly disruptive public health problem with a disproportionate impact on adolescents and young adults.

40|$|Mycosis of the skin, {{also called}} dermatomycosis, affects {{a large part}} of the world’s {{population}} and they had a considerable influence on health in Europe until the middle of the 20 th century. Many of these infections occur as <b>hyperendemic</b> <b>diseases</b> capable of producing epidemic outbreaks in susceptible populations, especially in chil-dren and teenagers [2]. These infections now mainly affect less-developed countries, and the lower social clas-ses of industrial cities, where there are conditions of poor hygiene and a lack of health care; in this rather large pro-portion of the world’s population, for example, there is still a hyperendemia of tinea capitis in prepubertal chil-dren. Infections of the nails are also included in this group of skin mycosis, in spite of the fact that they are usually considered superficial infections; the fungal inva-sion does in fact frequently cause a hyperkeratosis reac-tion and a greater or lesser degree of destruction to the external layers or other structures. Infections of the nails caused by fungi have not been extensively studied. This is partly because traditio-nally they have been considered more a cosmetic problem than a health problem [3], and therefore of only minor importance. As dermatomycosis are not diseases requiring declaration, just like other types of mycosis, little is known of their incidence and prevalence in the world’s population. As will be seen here, most of the available data proceeds from partial clinical or mycological studies carried out in very specific areas. Sometimes even in an extremely limited population.

40|$|The {{clinical}} and epidemiologic features of 73 patients with laboratory-confirmed blastomyco-sis who were identified over an II-year period in North Central Wisconsin are presented. Pulmo-nary disease {{was the sole}} manifestation in 77 % of patients. More than one-halfofall patients had symptoms that included fever, cough, weight loss, night sweats, and pleuritic chest pain. Vir-tually all were previously healthy, and most {{did not have an}} outdoor occupation. However, 82 % of these patients lived or had visited within 500 m of rivers or associated waterways. The majority experienced the onset of symptoms between December and April. The estimated mean annual incidence rate of infection for Vilas County was 40. 4 cases per 100, 000 persons, and that for the largest city in the county was 101. 3 cases per 100, 000 persons. Several areas with an exception-ally high incidence of the infection were ob. served. We suggest that, in regions where blastomyco-sis is <b>hyperendemic,</b> clinical <b>disease</b> is most often pulmonary and occurs in immunocompetent individuals and that residence near an ecological focus may be a greater risk factor for acquisition of blastomycosis than is occupation.

40|$|To {{develop a}} {{realistic}} {{model of the}} situation, a study {{was carried out in}} four different socioeconomic and hygienic areas of Tirane, namely in the modern and historical centre {{as well as in the}} intermediate and peripheral areas. In each area interviewers from the city's Public Health Directorate, contacted randomly, door-to-door, the residents, submitting a questionnaire and collecting water samples at the same time. Our data show relevant differences regarding distribution and quality of drinking water between the centre and peripheral areas. One third of water samples revealed the presence of microorganisms, whereas one fifth had no residual chlorine. Altogether more than 200, 000 people in the peripheral areas of Tirane live under low level hygienic conditions.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the two isotypes of tbpB {{in a collection of}} 108 serogroup B meningococcal strains belonging to the four major clonal groups associated with epidemic and <b>hyperendemic</b> <b>disease</b> (the ET- 37 complex, the ET- 5 complex, lineage III, and cluster A 4) was determined. Isotype I strains (with a 1. 8 -kb tbpB gene) was less represented than isotype II strains (19. 4 versus 80. 6 %). Isotype I was restricted to the ET- 37 complex strains, while isotype II was found in all four clonal complexes. The extent of the allelic diversity of tbpB in these two groups was studied by PCR restriction analysis and sequencing of 10 new tbpB genes. Four major tbpB gene variants were characterized: B 16 B 6 (representative of isotype I) and M 982, BZ 83, and 8680 (representative of isotype II). The relevance of these variants was assessed at the antigenic level by the determination of cross-bactericidal activity of purified immunoglobulin G preparations raised to the corresponding recombinant TbpB (rTbpB) protein against a panel of 27 strains (5 of isotype I and 22 of isotype II). The results indicated that rTbpB corresponding to each variant was able to induce cross-bactericidal antibodies. However, the number of strains killed with an anti-rTbpB serum was slightly lower than that obtained with an anti-TbpA+B complex. None of the sera tested raised against an isotype I strain was able to kill an isotype II strain and vice versa. None of the specific antisera tested (anti-rTbpB or anti-TbpA+B complex) was able to kill all of the 22 isotype II strains tested. Moreover, using sera raised against the C-terminus domain of TbpB M 982 (amino acids 352 to 691) or BZ 83 (amino acids 329 to 669) fused to the maltose-binding protein, cross-bactericidal activity was detected against 12 and 7 isotype II strains, respectively, of the 22 tested. These results suggest surface accessibility of the C-terminal end of TbpB. Altogether, these results show that although more than one rTbpB will be required in the composition of a TbpB-based vaccine to achieve a fully cross-bactericidal activity, rTbpB and its C terminus were able by themselves to induce cross-bactericidal antibodies...|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} of ticks and incidence of tick-borne illness in Central New York {{has increased dramatically}} in recent years. Popular state recreation areas were identified as <b>hyperendemic</b> with Lyme <b>disease</b> in 2014. Deer carrying infected ticks are commonly found in urbanized areas in the City of Syracuse and surrounding suburban areas. A coordinated education effort was needed {{to inform the public}} about how to reduce tick exposure in residential and recreational landscapes, how to identify ticks and symptoms of tick-borne illness. This project sought to increase public knowledge about IPM approaches to reduce tick exposure through: public presentations, direct outreach at the NYS Fair and public events, public information displays at recreational sites, and informational and online surveys.

40|$|Abstract. Coprologic {{surveys were}} carried out in villages of the Behera Governorate in the Nile Delta region of Egypt to {{characterize}} the epidemiologic features of human fascioliasis caused by Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica in this lowland endemic area by comparison with fascioliasis caused by only F. hepatica in areas <b>hyperendemic</b> for human <b>disease</b> in the Andean highlands of South America. The fascioliasis prevalences detected (range 5. 2 − 19. 0 %, mean 12. 8 %) are the highest obtained in Egypt. The comparison with previous results suggests that in the Nile Delta, fascioliasis is spreading from an original situation of sporadic human cases in well-known endemic foci for animal disease to an endemic distribution in humans, which may be characterized as a mesoendemic region that includes several hyperendemic areas for human disease. As in Andean countries, a relationship with sex was found, although in Egypt prevalences, but not intensities, appeared to be significantly higher in females. All ages appear to be susceptible to liver fluke infection, with prevalences and intensities being lower before and after school age, {{a situation that is}} consistent with that detected in Andean countries, although the peak in the 9 − 11 -year-old age group appears less pronounced in Egypt. The intensities were very high when compared with those found in subjects sporadically infected in areas endemic for animal disease, but relatively low for a hyperendemic situation, although the intensities may not be conclusiv...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDengue {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious and rapidly {{emerging}} tropical mosquito-borne diseases. The state of Kerala in India is <b>hyperendemic</b> for the <b>disease</b> and {{is one of the}} leading states in the reporting of deaths due to dengue. As primary prevention of dengue has had limited success, the prevention of mortality through the identification of risk factors and efficient patient management is of utmost importance. Hence, a record-based case control study was conducted in the Medical College Hospital in Thiruvananthapuram to identify the risk factors of mortality in patients admitted with dengue. Dengue patients over 40 years of age were 9. 3 times (95 % CI; 1. 9 – 44. 4) more likely to die compared with younger patients. The clinical features associated with mortality from dengue were altered sensorium (odds ratio (OR) – 156, 95 % CI; 12. 575 – 1935. 197), abnormal reflexes (OR – 8. 5, 95 % CI; 1. 833 – 39. 421) and edema (OR – 13. 22, 95 % CI; 2. 651 – 65. 951). Mortality was also higher in those patients with co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus (OR – 26, 95 % CI; 2. 47 – 273. 674) and hypertension (OR – 44, 95 % CI; 6. 23 – 315. 499). The independent predictors of mortality were altered sensorium and hypertension. Dengue fever patients with these clinical features and those who are elderly should be more rigorously monitored and promptly referred from lower settings when required to reduce mortality...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is {{the cause}} of an unusually severe form of liver disease with {{distinct}} histologic features (morula cell) that occurs throughout northern South America and certain other areas of the world. Clinical studies of HDV disease worldwide indicate that there is, in fact, a wide variation in pathogenesis, and the reasons for these differences are presently unknown. One possible explanation is that factors associated with the viral genotype are determinants of HDV pathogenesis. In this study, nucleic acid sequences were determined for three different northern South American HDV isolates which were obtained from individuals with severe disease or a family history of severe disease, in areas that are <b>hyperendemic</b> for this <b>disease</b> pattern. The sequences of these three isolates are very similar to one another but only distantly related to other published HDV sequences. Comparison of the sequence of a semiconserved region from a total of 14 isolates indicates that {{there are at least three}} HDV genotypes. Most published HDV sequences, including those from North America, Europe, the Middle East, the South Pacific, and Asia, belong to a single genotype which may have some geographically based subtypes. A single Japanese isolate is the sole representative of a second HDV genotype. The South American sequences reported here constitute a third genotype. The association of a particular genotype with the severe form of type D hepatitis that occurs in northern South America supports the hypothesis that HDV genetic factors are important determinants in the pathogenesis of type D hepatitis...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiologic {{field studies}} of eye infections in a Punjab village were done to define {{some of the}} factors {{influencing}} prevalence in a <b>hyperendemic</b> area. Few <b>diseases</b> of the tropics cause as much mass disability and distress as eye infections. Thus far research has been oriented mainly toward clinical definition and therapy. Trachoma is the diagnos tic label applied to {{what appears to be}} a very common but variable clinical entity. Little has been learned about trachoma either epidemio logically or as a result of laboratory studies; etiology is as yet unproved although there is scattered evidence from limited volunteer studies that the agent may be filterable and a virus (Thygeson and Richards, 1938). The only labora tory procedure of practical use has been finding inclusion bodies in early cases, but until the virus is isolated it is difficult to evaluate the significance of these bodies. Some surveys have been done on selected groups such as patients in clinics, soldiers, and school children. (Bietti, 1951; Brafi and Winkel stein, 1952; Chang, 1951; Scott, 1950; Murray, 1953). These surveys have been used in guiding control programs and they have given certain epidemiological impressions. In some studies the numbers examined included thousands of people, but the samples were restricted to limited and often unrepresentative groups. For a more complete picture of the epidem iology of eye diseases it is better to study either a total population unit such as a village or a statistically representative sample of a popula tion. In the few field studies in total population units which have been reported it has been possible to study fundamental epidemiological questions such as whether infections are acquired in homes or at school, by gathering basic data on the age distribution of infected persons.
