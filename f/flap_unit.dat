The theory of a propulsive wing flapping up and down periodically {{in the manner of a}} bird's wing is developed.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} digital {{model for}} the analysis and possible optimization of the closed loop dynamic (instantaneous) performance of a power conditioner fed, brushless dc motor powered, electromechanical actuator system (EMA) is presented. This model was developed for the simulation of the dynamic performance of an actual prototype EMA built for NASA-JSC as a possible alternative to hydraulic actuators for consideration in Space Shuttle Orbiter applications. Excellent correlation was achieved between numerical model simulation and experimental test results obtained from the actual hardware. These results include: various current and voltage waveforms in the machine-power conditioner (MPC) <b>unit,</b> <b>flap</b> position {{as well as other}} control loop variables in response to step commands of change of flap position.

40|$|Segmented vortex flaps were {{suggested}} {{as a means}} of delaying the vortex spill-over causing thrust loss over the outboard region of single-panel flaps. Also proposed was hinge-line setback for exploiting leading-edge suction in conjunction with vortex flaps to improve the overall thrust per <b>unit</b> <b>flap</b> area. These two concepts in combination were tested on a 60 -deg cropped delta wing model. Significant improvement in flap efficiency was indicated by a reduction of the flap/wing area from 11. 4 % of single-panel flap to 6. 3 % of a two segment delta flap design, with no lift/drag penalty at lift coefficients between 0. 5 and 0. 7. The more efficient vortex flap arrangement of this study should benefit the performance attainable with flaps of given area on wings of moderate leading-edge sweep...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental and numerical study of an autonomous load alleviation concept using trailing edge flaps. The <b>flaps</b> are autonomous <b>units,</b> which for instance {{can be used}} for gust load alleviation. The unit is self-powered and self-actuated through trailing edge tabs which are mounted as aerodynamic control devices on free-floating flaps. The flaps are mass underbalanced such that flutter occurs in the operational envelope unless it is suppressed by the control system. Therefore the system is very responsive to both external excitation and control activity of the trailing edge tab. The electrical energy for control activities is then generated by maintaining the flap in controlled limit cycle oscillations. The numerical simulation of such an autonomous flap system demonstrates the ability of controlling the amplitude of limit cycle oscillations, while a net gain in power can be used to charge the battery. These results are compared to experimental results obtained by a wind tunnel study of the said system. Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & PropulsionAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} various gust {{alleviation}} methods on the random blade response in flapping were studied analytically, assuming a rigid rotor support. The analytical model assumes rigid flapping blades with elastic root restraints. Linearized equations which are approximately valid at low lift conditions were used. Because of the interblade coupling from the feedback devices, {{the method of}} multiblade generalized coordinates was most convenient and was extended to include coning, differential coning, and warping of the rotor. The numerical examples cover the dynamic stability characteristics as affected by feedback gains of three- to six-bladed rotors. The number of blades had large effects on stability limits and modal time functions at these limits. The random flapping response of the blades to atmospheric turbulence was determined at 1. 6 rotor advance ratio using feedback gains below the stability limit. The most effective reduction of the <b>flapping</b> response per <b>unit</b> gain was achieved with a rotor coning angle feedback...|$|R
40|$|The peroneus brevis flap {{was first}} {{described}} as proximally based by Mathes et al (Surg Clin North Am. 1974; 54 : 1337 - 1354) {{and later by}} Jackson and Scheker (Injury. 1982; 13 : 324 - 330). A distally based version of this flap by Mathes and Nahai (Reconstructive Surgery: Principles, Anatomy and Technique. 1997 : 1437 e 46) was subsequently described in 1997. The first case series of distally based flaps was published by Eren et al (Plast Reconstr Surg. 2001; 107 : 1443 - 1448). In our experience, the distally based flap is a useful muscle flap to reconstruct small defects in the lateral distal third of the leg. Initial interest and confidence {{in the use of}} this <b>flap</b> in our <b>unit</b> were hindered by lack of direct experience and descriptive detail in the literature. We have now developed a systematic approach to harvest the distally pedicled peroneus brevis muscle flap in 5 reproducible, safe steps. This has allowed the flap to become adopted as a standard technique of limb reconstruction in our unit with no cases of flap loss...|$|R
40|$|In this {{publication}} {{a summary of}} the research on micropumps and microfluid components for mu mTAS applications is given, which has been conducted in the framework of the research projects VIMAS and MIBIK, supported by the German Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Technology (BMBF). In the framework of VIMAS a mu mTAS for water quality control is developed, which uses four micropumps for the supply of sample, calibrant and carrier solution. For this purpose an electrostatically actuated micropump was developed. This device basically consists of four silicon chips with outer dimensions of 7 x 7 mm 2, which are mounted as a stack and form an electrostatic actuation <b>unit</b> and a <b>flap</b> valve <b>unit.</b> Pumping operation is achieved by applying a square wave signal to the electrostatic actuator, which causes an alternate electrostatic attraction and mechanical relaxation of the flexible pump membrane. With a stroke volume of about 30 nl, the actual design delivers a pump rate up to 1 ml/min and a maximum counter pressure of 300 mbar, which is by far sufficient for the operation in a mu mTAS. For fluidic interconnection of the mu mTAS a silicon backplane with total outer dimensions of 30 x 30 mm 2 was realized, which comprises anisotropically etched fluid channels on the back side and fluid connection ports on the front side. The fluid channels are closed with an anodically bonded pyrex cover. In the framework of MIBIK two hybrid Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) systems are being developed, which integrate silicon microfluid components with conventional macroscopic fluid devices such as roller pumps. For these analyzers, the following microfluid components have been realized: A micro-miniaturized channel-type immunoreactor; a micro-miniaturized membrane-type immunoreactor; a hybrid-integrated micro-thermostat, and a micro flow-through cell for amperometric biosensors...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made in}} the LMAL 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel of a NACA 23021 airfoil with a double slotted flap having a chord 32 percent of the airfoil chord (0. 32 c) to determine the aerodynamic section characteristics with the flaps deflected at various positions. The effects of moving the fore flap and rear <b>flap</b> as a <b>unit</b> and of deflecting or removing the lower lip of the slot were also determined. Three positions were selected for the fore flap and at each position the maximum lift of the airfoil was obtained with the rear flap at the maximum deflection used at that fore-flap position. The section lift of the airfoil increased as the fore flap was extended and maximum lift was obtained with the fore flap deflected 30 deg in the most extended position. This arrangement provided a maximum section lift coefficient of 3. 31, which was higher than the value obtained with either a 0. 2566 c or a 0. 40 c single-slotted-flap arrangement and 0. 25 less than the value obtained with a 0. 4 c double-slotted-flap arrangement on the same airfoil. The values of the profile-drag coefficient obtained with the 0. 32 c double slotted flap were larger than those for the 0. 2566 c or 0. 40 c single slotted flaps for section lift coefficients between 1. 0 and approximately 2. 7. At all values of the section lift coefficient above 1. 0, the 0. 40 c double slotted flap had a lower profile drag than the 0. 32 c double slotted flap. At various values of the maximum section lift coefficient produced by various flap defections, the 0. 32 c double slotted flap gave negative section pitching-moment coefficients that were higher than those of other slotted flaps on the same airfoil. The 0. 32 c double slotted flap gave approximately the same maximum section lift coefficient as, but higher profile-drag coefficients over the entire lift range than, a similar arrangement of a 0. 30 c double slotted flap on an NACA 23012 airfoil...|$|R
