25|$|In {{the southeastern}} {{area of the}} old town is the Hofstatt, the town’s only large open square. The Zeughaus (Armory), {{completed}} in 1673, {{is located on the}} square’s northern side. The baroque structure stands out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> with its protruding tower topped by a bulbous dome (an architectural design that is rarely encountered in the German-speaking section of Switzerland). The southern side of the Hofstatt is flanked by the dominant Salzhaus (Salt House), which was completed in 1732, and was used to store salt until the middle of the 19th century. Other than the attic space, the building is composed entirely of one large room with twelve supporting pillars.|$|E

Though the Violator tells Jim he has the answers he seeks, it is made clear by the Freak, that the Violator is not on his side. When confronted by the truth, the Violator threatens Jim and the Freak. Before Jim can get any {{information}} from Violator, he retreats deeper <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleys.</b> <b>The</b> Violator goes to, [...] "slaughter someone who could endanger my plans".

50|$|Listed at 6 ft 1 in and 176 lb, Sakamoto has a {{relatively}} large frame for a Japanese middle infielder. He is a spray hitter whose swing {{is characterized by a}} pronounced leg kick. Though the majority of his extra-base hits tend to be line drives <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> (37 doubles in 653 career at-bats as of May 13, 2009), many predict that Sakamoto will develop home run power as his body fills out.|$|R

60|$|His eloquent look {{had more}} to say, his hand drew me forward, his {{interpreting}} lips stirred. No. Not now.

60|$|The evening, however, {{found him}} {{starting}} {{slowly in the}} direction of Fullalove Alley. His father had gone to sea again, and the house was very dull; moreover, he felt a mild curiosity to see the changes wrought by time in Mr. Wilks.

60|$|His pursuers {{were almost}} upon {{him when he}} seized the rude ladder to clamber upward.
