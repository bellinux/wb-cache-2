40|$|Obsolescence is most {{frequently}} {{talked about in}} relation to <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> technology. A still-common way of understanding modernity is as a linear succession of emerging technologies which supersede existing ones, and which are themselves, in time, made redundant. <b>The</b> cycle <b>of</b> novelty and obsolescence underpins a narrative including episodes of human invention, mastery and eventual technological failure. Nevertheless, it makes technologies themselves <b>the</b> subjects <b>of</b> history, rather than the human beings whose choices frame their contingent births, shapings, adoptions and uses. Many have pointed out {{the extent to which}} this simplifies history, but this has made precious little impact, if the way in which many writers treat digital communications technologies is any guide. Professional new media evangelists, including media and cultural theorists who subscribe to what Turner describes as an entrenched 2 ̆ 2 digital orthodoxy 2 ̆ 2, are nowadays wont to describing mass media - including all broadcast and print media - as 2 ̆ 2 heritage 2 ̆ 2 media. This neat rhetorical trick confirms all remaining manifestations and uses of such media as remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past in the present, as curiosities, even perhaps as impediments to the 2 ̆ 2 imaginary futures 2 ̆ 2 (Barbrook) regularly projected onto new technologies. On the other hand, similar assumptions underlie narratives of decline and decay which attach themselves to new media technologies. Thus we can understand laments for the lost qualities (and quality) of old media from writers such as Andrew Keen, which themselves shape self-interested pronouncements about <b>the</b> <b>decadence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new communications <b>environment</b> from <b>the</b> highest echelons <b>of</b> established media (Hartigan) ...|$|R

40|$|Current {{commercial}} interferometers reveal excellent measurement performances, {{because of}} its major advantage which enables the displacement measurement with <b>the</b> characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high resolution under the large measuring range. Fabry-Perot interferometer is a compact interferometer with <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> common optical path. In comparison with the ordinary commercial laser interferometers having non-common optical path, Fabry-Perot interferometer is more insensitive to environmental disturbances. But <b>the</b> disadvantages <b>of</b> Fabry-Perot interferometer are the limited measuring range and <b>the</b> considerable visibility <b>decadence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interference pattern. To enlarge the measuring range, the folded Fabry-Perot interferometer in which a corner cube reflector severs as the measurement mirror has been proposed in the previous research. However, either the conventional Fabry-Perot interferometer or the folded Fabry-Perot interferometer still have <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> considerable visibility <b>decadence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interference pattern. When <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> optical cavity is changed, <b>the</b> overlapped state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laser beams will be varied strongly. Hence, it is indispensible to offer a proper signal interpolation algorithm for various signal distributions during the displacement measurement in the whole measuring range. An advanced signal interpolation algorithm for the above-mentioned Fabry-Perot interferometer has been proposed in this investigation. The novel algorithm is able to solve <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> displacement measurement due to <b>the</b> considerable visibility <b>decadence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interference pattern. With this algorithm, a high precision displacement measurement in the large measuring range can be realized by the folded Fabry-Perot interferomete...|$|R
