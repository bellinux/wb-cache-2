40|$|The {{ability of}} the analog {{computer}} to stimulate physical phenomena is {{used in conjunction with}} a resistance paper model of the Walnut Gulch watershed in Arizona to plot constant precipitation maps from data obtained from recorded rainfall. Voltages which are proportional to rainfall at a specific raingage, located at scaled points of the resistance paper model, set up an electric field on the resistive sheet which is detected and processed by the computer. The detected potential is compared to a reference potential, or 2 ̆ 2 precipitation value 2 ̆ 2, and the necessary analog networks allow plotting of the equipotential line which is directly analogous to an <b>isohyetal</b> <b>line...</b>|$|E
40|$|From the Proceedings of the 1988 Meetings of the Arizona Section - American Water Resources Association and the Hydrology Section - Arizona-Nevada Academy of Science - April 16, 1988, University of Arizona, Tucson, ArizonaSeasonal {{and annual}} {{precipitation}} vary considerably in Arizona, {{primarily because of}} topographic influences. Precipitation data have been analyzed by several investigators over the years. Arizona has been subdivided into precipitation zones, and seasonal and annual precipitation isohyetal maps are available from several sources. Because of a paucity of raingages in the more mountainous regions, however, <b>isohyetal</b> <b>lines</b> in these regions have been largely estimated based on the assumptions of topographic influences. Now, with 158 raingages with 30 {{or more years of}} record, topographic factors can be combined with greater knowledge of the sources and paths of moisture into the state to better define annual and seasonal precipitation variability. Elevation and aspect appear to be the principal parameters for analyzing precipitation within the state, with the Mogollon Rim exerting the greatest influence on winter precipitation. Higher than anticipated summer rainfall in southeastern Arizona (based on elevation and aspect) suggest that sources and availability of atmospheric moisture may be a strong parameter in analyzing summer rainfall...|$|R
40|$|The hydrologic {{characteristics}} of watersheds in semiarid regions are dependent upon many variable and often interrelated factors. A quantitative {{knowledge of these}} factors and of their relative influence upon {{the system as a}} whole is needed in order to improve the efficiency of watershed management in these areas. In an attempt to develop a comprehensive simulation model of a semiarid watershed, research workers in the Agricultural Research Service considered the electronic quently signed with Utah State University. Analog modeling concepts are based upon the development of basic relationships which describe the various processes which occur within the surface hydrologic system of a semiarid watershed. Once established, the model is applicable to any particular geographic unit by determining the appropriate constants of the hydrologic equations. The analog computer is ideally suited to the many time-dependent differential equations which are encountered in hydrologic systems. To test individual equations and to verify the model, a subbasin of Walnut Gulch watershed in southern Arizona was simulated. In preliminary tests, close agreement was achieved between the observed and computed runoff hydrographs for a single storm. Some progress is also reported in the development of an analog technique to plot <b>isohyetal</b> <b>lines</b> corresponding to selected time intervals {{during the course of a}} storm...|$|R
40|$|This thesis engages various {{methods of}} {{calculation}} of the spatial distribution of precipitation and the evaluation of differences in totals of rainfall in a chosen catchment. The aim of this work was to choose suitable methods for the calculation of areal rainfall and subsequently to create those methods. Most methods were developed in the GIS program. The next objective was to explore differences in monthly precipitation from hydrological years 2006 and 2007 calculated in the catchment by chosen methods. Chosen methods for the {{calculation of the}} spatial distribution of precipitation in the catchment were: arithmetic mean, Thiessen polygons, isohyetal method and inverse distance weighting method. (IDW). As a suitable catchment was selected the catchment of the Kopaninský stream where relatively dense rainfall measurement network is installed. During the solution of this thesis the area of interest had to be extended by the area between the used rain gauges which was delimited in the GIS program. The reason for an enlargement was a fact that a decomposition of rain gauges in the catchment of the Kopaninský stream did not permit the creation of <b>isohyetal</b> <b>lines</b> in this whole catchment. During the calculation and the comparison of results of individual methods was found that results of used methods were surprisingly nearly the same. It was also stated that not even sufficient dense rain gauges network does not guarantee 100 % exactness for calculating {{the amount of the}} precipitation in the selected area because of their extraordinary variability...|$|R
