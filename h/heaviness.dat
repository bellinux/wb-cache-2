5|$|The <b>heaviness</b> of {{naturally}} occurring metals such as gold, copper, and iron {{may have been}} noticed in prehistory and, {{in light of their}} malleability, led to the first attempts to craft metal ornaments, tools, and weapons. All metals discovered from then until 1809 had relatively high densities; their <b>heaviness</b> was regarded as a singularly distinguishing criterion.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{suggests}} that the Allied ships were heavier and, by implication, less maneuverable. Their weight would further {{reduce the likelihood of}} the Allied ships employing the diekplous. The source of this <b>heaviness</b> is uncertain; possibly the Allied ships were bulkier in construction. Another suggestion is that the <b>heaviness</b> was caused by the weight of fully armoured hoplite marines. The Allies may have had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier). Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships, rather than sinking them.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may on {{occasions}} prey on lambs. Usually, lambs {{targeted by}} foxes {{tend to be}} physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as Blackface, are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as Merino. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the <b>heaviness</b> of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{conditions}} associated with thrombophilia are {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which are referred to collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, swelling and redness of the limb. It may lead to long-term swelling and <b>heaviness</b> due to damage to valves in the veins. The clot may also break off and migrate (embolize) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size {{and the location of}} the clot, this may lead to sudden-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations and may be complicated by collapse, shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is a very}} {{bold and}} {{assertive}} wine that has potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes. The wine's high tannin content {{as well as the}} oak influences and high alcohol levels associated with many regional styles play important roles in influencing how well the wine matches with different foods. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, all those elements are at their peak, but as the wine ages it mellows; possibilities for different food pairings open up. In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) of the wine to the <b>heaviness</b> of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to hotness levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating the bitterness of the tannins. Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due to their ability to minimize the perception of tannins—such as in the classic pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon with steak au poivre and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.|$|E
5|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised Lee's vocals and its piano accompaniment, with some highlighting {{it as one}} of the album's best tracks. Following the digital sales of Evanescence, the song charted at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number nine on the UK Rock Chart. It also charted at numbers 31, 89, and 174 on the Swiss Singles Chart, Canadian Hot 100, and UK Singles Chart respectively. The band also added the song to the set list of their third worldwide tour Evanescence Tour (2011–12). After their performances at the Carnival of Madness tour, live footage of their performances were used to make a music video for the song. The song's live performance was received positively as well; one critic noted the song's building <b>heaviness</b> as the band became more involved.|$|E
25|$|Fullness, <b>heaviness,</b> pressure, swelling, or {{bloating}} in the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|Mild ascites {{is hard to}} notice, but severe ascites {{leads to}} {{abdominal}} distension. Patients with ascites generally will complain of progressive abdominal <b>heaviness</b> and pressure as well as shortness of breath due to mechanical impingement on the diaphragm.|$|E
25|$|CNS effects: Nervousness, depression, restlessness, crying, euphoria, flushing, hostility, unusual dreams, confusion, faintness, hallucinations, dysphoria, {{feeling of}} <b>heaviness,</b> numbness, tingling, unreality. The {{incidence}} of psychotomimetic effects, such as unreality, depersonalization, delusions, dysphoria and hallucinations {{has been shown}} to be less than that which occurs with pentazocine.|$|E
25|$|An {{analytic}} proposition is true {{by nature}} {{of the meaning of}} the words in the sentence — we require no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand this proposition. On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one that tells us something about the world. The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content. In this instance, weight is not a necessary predicate of the body; until we are told the <b>heaviness</b> of the body we do not know that it has weight. In this case, experience of the body is required before its <b>heaviness</b> becomes clear. Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf. Hume) and rationalists (cf. Leibniz) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known.|$|E
25|$|The varicoceles {{might be}} noticed as soft lumps, usually above the {{testicle}} and {{mostly on the}} left side of the scrotum. Right-sided and bilateral varicoceles do also occur. Some people who have them feel pain or <b>heaviness</b> in their scrotum. Varicoceles are sometimes discovered when investigating the cause of male infertility.|$|E
25|$|The {{three primary}} signs of {{fertility}} are basal body temperature (BBT), cervical mucus, and cervical position. A woman practicing symptoms-based fertility awareness {{may choose to}} observe one sign, two signs, or all three. Many women experience secondary fertility signs that correlate with certain phases of the menstrual cycle, such as abdominal pain and <b>heaviness,</b> back pain, breast tenderness, and mittelschmerz (ovulation pains).|$|E
25|$|Prolonged GH excess thickens {{the bones}} of the jaw, fingers and toes. Resulting <b>heaviness</b> of the jaw and {{increased}} size of digits is referred to as acromegaly. Accompanying problems can include sweating, pressure on nerves (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome), muscle weakness, excess sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), insulin resistance or even a rare form of type 2 diabetes, and reduced sexual function.|$|E
25|$|An eclectic {{combination}} of Victorian styles {{can be seen}} in the Vassar Institute building: the decorative cornices of Italianate buildings, the <b>heaviness</b> of Victorian Gothic and the mansard roof common on Second Empire buildings. Many features are similar to designs by James Renwick, Jr., for the early buildings of Vassar College in the 1860s. The colorful exterior recalls the polychrome brick buildings of the preceding decades as well.|$|E
25|$|Another way to {{understand}} the Aeroscraft’s VTOL capability is to compare the Aeroscraft to a submarine. For example, when a submarine needs to dive into the water, it takes on water to make it heavier. When the submarine needs to surface, it releases that water to become lighter. Similarly, the Aeroscraft can control its weight by releasing and taking on air, controlling the <b>heaviness</b> or lightness of the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|White wine is {{regularly}} {{used as an}} ingredient. Its acidity balances well with fat taking away excess <b>heaviness.</b> This acidity also refines the meat or fish and it helps {{to break down the}} fibres of the meat to make it tender. The role of white wine {{is similar to that of}} lemon juice used under the same conditions: once verjuice also fulfilled this function. The vinegar combines acidity with a burning sensation that gives recipes where it is used a bittersweet side characteristic.|$|E
25|$|Gothic metal (or goth metal) is {{a fusion}} genre {{combining}} the <b>heaviness</b> of heavy metal {{with the dark}} atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences.|$|E
25|$|Sandbox detection: is a {{particular}} behavioural-based detection technique that, instead of detecting the behavioural fingerprint at run time, it executes the programs in a virtual environment, logging what actions the program performs. Depending on the actions logged, the antivirus engine can determine if the program is malicious or not. If not, then, the program is executed in the real environment. Albeit this technique has shown to be quite effective, given its <b>heaviness</b> and slowness, it is rarely used in end-user antivirus solutions.|$|E
25|$|In most girls, {{menarche}} {{does not}} mean that ovulation has occurred. In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third and 10% in the sixth year. Regular ovulation is usually indicated by predictable and consistent intervals between menses, predictable and consistent durations of menses, and predictable and consistent patterns of flow (e.g., <b>heaviness</b> or cramping). Continuing ovulation typically requires a body fat content of at least 22%. An anthropological term for this state of potential fertility is nubility.|$|E
25|$|Although now obsolescent, the Idflieg {{accepted}} the Forssman into service in April 1916 as a trainer. Further {{development of the}} design was halted, although the aircraft's ballast was moved to counter tail <b>heaviness</b> that Steffen encountered on the acceptance flight. Shortly after acceptance, the aircraft's fuselage fractured just aft of the wings, due to engine vibrations while running the engines on the ground. The Forssman was dismantled at that point, and Bruno Steffen expressed relief at the news, as the aircraft {{would not be able}} to endanger other lives.|$|E
25|$|Corbusier's piloti {{perform a}} number of {{functions}} around the house, both inside and out. On the two longer elevations they are flush {{with the face of}} the façade and imply <b>heaviness</b> and support, but on the shorter sides they are set back giving a floating effect that emphasises the horizontal feeling of the house. The wide strip window to the first floor terrace has two baby piloti to support and stiffen the wall above. Although these piloti are in a similar plane to the larger columns below a false perspective when viewed from outside the house gives the impression that they are further into the house than they actually are.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, an AZP event {{occurred}} in the United States in July. Frozen, pre-cooked mussels from Bantry Bay, Ireland were exported and intoxicated two people. It is estimated that each person ate between 113 and 340 grams of shellfish. Within five hours following the meal, each person experienced abdominal <b>heaviness,</b> vomiting (5-15 times), and diarrhea for up to 30 hours. Analysis of similar products with the same lot number revealed the presence of AZA1-3 with up to 0.244 μg AZAtotal/g tissue. As {{a result of this}} event, over 150 tonnes of commercial product were removed from the market and voluntarily destroyed by the manufacturer.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide Aeros {{was awarded}} a patent of their control of static <b>heaviness</b> system (COSH) {{internal}} buoyancy management system in May 2015. The COSH system internally ballasts the non-flammable helium into the aircraft’s helium pressure envelopes (HPEs), helping the vehicle manage buoyant lift. The HPE units contain and control the compressed helium and allow the overall helium volume envelope to be reduced or increased, enabling the air vehicle to become heavy or buoyant in a controlled manner. The compression of helium into the HPE’s creates a negative pressure within the Aeroscraft Aeroshell, permitting air-expansion chambers to fill with readily-available environmental ballast (air), which acts in concert with reduced Helium static lift to make the Aeroscraft heavier, when desired, to compensate for adjustments in payload.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos invited Moore to {{work with}} him on a new musical project. Moore had worked with Matheos before, {{appearing}} as guest keyboardist on Fates Warning's 1989 album Perfect Symmetry, 1997 album A Pleasant Shade of Gray and 2000 album Disconnected. The new project involved Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy and Cynic bassist/Chapman Stick player Sean Malone. This would be the first time Moore had worked with Portnoy since leaving Dream Theater nearly 10 years earlier. The band that was formed was named OSI, and they released the album Office of Strategic Influence. Musically, it can be described as a mixture of Chroma Key's dark, melodic focus with the guitars and <b>heaviness</b> of Fates Warning and Dream Theater. Moore assumed vocal duties.|$|E
25|$|The Edge of Night {{played on}} more artistic levels than {{probably}} any other soap of its time. It was unique among daytime soap operas {{in that it}} focused on crime, rather than domestic and romantic matters. The police, district attorneys, and medical examiners of fictional Monticello, USA, dealt with a steady onslaught of gangsters, drug dealers, blackmailers, cultists, international spies, corrupt politicians, psychopaths, and murderous debutantes, {{while at the same}} time coping with more usual soap opera problems like courtship, marriage, divorce, child custody battles, and amnesia. The show's particular focus on crime was recognized in 1980, when, in honor of its 25 years on the air, The Edge of Night was given a special Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America. The Edge of Night had more prominent male characters than most soap operas, and included genuine humor in its scripts to balance the <b>heaviness</b> of the storylines.|$|E
25|$|Angina pectoris can {{be quite}} painful, but many {{patients}} with angina complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain: the discomfort is usually described as a pressure, <b>heaviness,</b> tightness, squeezing, burning, or choking sensation. Apart from chest discomfort, anginal pains may also be experienced in the epigastrium (upper central abdomen), back, neck area, jaw, or shoulders. This is explained by the concept of referred pain, and {{is due to the}} fact that the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerve's dermatome, without an ability to discriminate the two. Typical locations for referred pain are arms (often inner left arm), shoulders, and neck into the jaw. Angina is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures. Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness, sweating, and nausea in some cases. In this case, the pulse rate and the blood pressure increases. Chest pain lasting only a few seconds is normally not angina (such as precordial catch syndrome).|$|E
500|$|The subplot, where Bart buys a factory, {{was added}} {{so that there}} would be some lighter scenes to split up the main plot. According to Weinstein, [...] "We wanted to have a Bart or Lisa kids story to {{contrast}} the <b>heaviness</b> and reality of Frank Grimes." ...|$|E
500|$|In a five-star {{review for}} Goldmine magazine, Gillian Gaar {{considered}} that Collaborations [...] "succeeded on crossover appeal" [...] and had {{praise for the}} [...] "mesmerizing" [...] Music Festival album and concert DVD. Reviewing the box set for Uncut, John Lewis found Harrison [...] "a little too respectful" [...] in his deference to Shankar on the 1970s projects, although he admired Chants of India, saying: [...] "there is a <b>heaviness</b> and intensity to each performance that makes this seemingly austere collection quite compelling to rock ears." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholar Ruth K. MacDonald {{argues that}} {{the black and white}} {{illustrations}} emphasize the mythic, permanent quality of the tale with heavy black lines that display little of the delicacy characteristic of Potter's work. [...] She suggests these pictures are more like woodcuts in their <b>heaviness</b> than drawings, and points out they were not [...] "tossed off" [...] to satisfy fans and her publisher, but deliberately planned to give an antique, primitive quality to the story in the manner of Caxton's woodcuts for his edition of Aesop's Fables.|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} much debate as {{to the nature of}} the Allied fleet {{compared}} to the Persian fleet. [...] Much of this centres on the suggestion, from Herodotus, that the Allied ships were heavier, and by implication less maneuverable. [...] The source of this <b>heaviness</b> is uncertain; possibly the Allied ships were bulkier in construction, or that the ships were water-logged since they had not been dried out in the winter (though there is no real evidence for either suggestion). Another suggestion is that the <b>heaviness</b> was caused by the weight of fully armored hoplite marines (20 fully armored hoplites would have weighed 2 tons). This 'heaviness', whatever its cause, would further reduce the likelihood of them employing the diekplous. It is therefore probable that the Allies had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier). Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships at Artemisium, rather than sinking them. It has been suggested that the weight of the Allied ships may also have made them more stable in the winds off the coast of Salamis, and made them less susceptible to ramming (or rather, less liable to sustain damage when rammed).|$|E
500|$|Manson {{was more}} {{involved}} in the album's composition than he was on preceding releases. It is primarily a heavy metal record, and, {{at the time of its}} release, it contained some of the heaviest material the band had ever recorded. A cover version of Carly Simon's [...] "You're So Vain" [...] featuring Johnny Depp was included as a bonus track on all editions of the record. The album received mixed reviews from music critics, with several publications considering it to be a comeback for the band, while others were critical of its violent lyrical content and <b>heaviness.</b> It became the band's seventh top ten studio album on the Billboard 200, and also topped Billboards Independent Albums and Top Hard Rock Albums charts.|$|E
500|$|Other Greek authors making {{reference}} to the narcissus include Sophocles and Plutarch. Sophocles, in Oedipus at Colonus utilises narcissus in a symbolic manner, implying fertility, allying it with the cults of Demeter and her daughter Kore (Persephone), and by extension, a symbol of death. Jebb comments {{that it is the}} flower of imminent death with its fragrance being narcotic, emphasised by its pale white colour. Just as Persephone reaching for the flower heralded her doom, the youth Narcissus gazing at his own reflection portended his own death. Plutarch refers to this in his Symposiacs as numbing the nerves causing a <b>heaviness</b> in the limbs. He refers to Sophocles' [...] "crown of the great Goddesses", which {{is the source of the}} English phrase [...] "Chaplet of the infernal Gods" [...] incorrectly attributed to Socrates.|$|E
500|$|Johansson {{publicly}} endorsed {{and supported}} Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer's 2013 run for New York City Comptroller by hosting {{a series of}} fundraisers. To encourage people {{to vote in the}} US election of 2016, Johansson appeared in a commercial alongside her Marvel Cinematic Universe co-star Robert Downey, Jr., and Joss Whedon. In 2017, she spoke at the Women's March on Washington, addressing Donald Trump's presidency and stating that she would support him if he works for women's rights and stops withdrawing federal funding for Planned Parenthood. She elaborated, [...] "Once the <b>heaviness</b> [...] began to subside, an opportunity has presented itself to make real long-term change, not just for future Americans, but in the way we view our responsibility to get involved with and stay active in our communities. Let this weight not drag you down, but help to get your heels stuck in." ...|$|E
500|$|Thomas Aquinas (c.1225–1274), {{following}} Avicenna, interpreted Aristotle to {{mean that}} there were two immaterial substances responsible for the motion of each celestial sphere, a soul that {{was an integral part of}} its sphere, and an intelligence that was separate from its sphere. [...] The soul shares the motion of its sphere and causes the sphere to move through its love and desire for the unmoved separate intelligence. [...] Avicenna, al-Ghazali, Moses Maimonides, and most Christian scholastic philosophers identified Aristotle's intelligences with the angels of revelation, thereby associating an angel with each of the spheres. [...] Moreover, Aquinas rejected the idea that celestial bodies are moved by an internal nature, similar to the <b>heaviness</b> and lightness that moves terrestrial bodies. [...] Attributing souls to the spheres was theologically controversial, as that could make them animals. [...] After the Condemnations of 1277, most philosophers came to [...] reject the idea that the celestial spheres had souls.|$|E
500|$|In production, Monsters Inc. {{differed}} from earlier Pixar features, as every main character {{in this movie}} had its own lead animator — John Kahrs on Sulley, Andrew Gordon on Mike, and Dave DeVan on Boo. Kahrs found that the [...] "bearlike quality" [...] of Goodman's voice provided an exceptionally good fit with the character. He faced a difficult challenge, however, in dealing with Sulley's sheer mass; traditionally, animators conveyed a figure's <b>heaviness</b> by giving it a slower, more belabored movement, but Kahrs was concerned that such an approach to a central character would give the film a [...] "sluggish" [...] feel. Like Goodman, Kahrs came to think of Sulley as a football player, one whose athleticism enabled him to move quickly {{in spite of his}} size. To help the animators with Sulley and other large monsters, Pixar arranged for Rodger Kram, a University of California, Berkeley expert on the locomotion of heavy mammals, to lecture on the subject.|$|E
500|$|M. F. K. Fisher, {{writing in}} The New York Times, stated that {{millions}} of American women in the 19th century organised [...] "every aspect of their lives [...]. {{as much as possible}} in imitation of the Queen", and that The Modern Cook sold almost as well in America as it did in England. Admitting that few American kitchens could [...] "follow all its directions for the light Gallic dainties Francatelli introduced to counteract the basic <b>heaviness</b> of royal dining habits", she argued that all the same his two-course approach eventually shaped the way Americans now eat both lunch and dinner. She observed that at Windsor Castle, Francatelli and other royal chefs were assisted by 24 assistant chefs and two [...] "Yeomen of the Kitchen", not to mention a multitude of [...] "servers and lackeys". This did not deter American housewives [...] "as far west as Iowa and then beyond" [...] from doing their best to follow his instructions.|$|E
