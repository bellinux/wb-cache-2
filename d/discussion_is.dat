5|$|Goffman {{uses the}} metaphor of {{conversation}} being a stage play. A plays tone will shift throughout the performance due to the actions taken by the actors; {{this is similar to}} how a <b>discussion</b> <b>is</b> keyed – based on what either person says or does over the course of an interaction, the key will change accordingly. The parallels go further, though. Goffman also claims that a speaker details a drama more often than they provide information. They invite the listener to empathize and, as was explained above, they’re often not meant to be stirred to take action, but rather to show appreciation; during a play this generally takes the form of applause.|$|E
5|$|Catesby {{waited for}} Percy's {{return from the}} north, before making his decision. He thought the letter too vague to {{constitute}} any meaningful threat to the plan, and decided to forge ahead. As Fawkes made a final check on the gunpowder, other conspirators took up their positions in the Midlands. Salisbury, already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, did not yet know {{the exact nature of}} the plot or who exactly was involved. He elected to wait, to see how events unfolded. On 3November, Catesby met with Wintour and Percy in London. Although the nature of their <b>discussion</b> <b>is</b> unknown, Fraser theorises that some adjustment of their plan to abduct Princess Elizabeth may have occurred, as later accounts told how Percy had been seen at the Duke of York's lodgings, enquiring as to the movements of the king's daughter. Nicholls mentions that a week earlier—on the same day that Monteagle received his letter—Catesby was at White Webbs with Fawkes, to discuss kidnapping Prince Henry rather than Princess Elizabeth.|$|E
