25|$|Hot {{water from}} the {{treatment}} plant was circulated in small-bore pipes alongside the pipeline to reduce heat losses and potential hydrate formation, an ice-like substance that can cause blockages. At the Pickering treatment plant raw gas was routed through a slug catcher and inlet separator to remove liquid hydrocarbons and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a counter-current aqueous solution of soda ash and arsenic compounds to convert the hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further liquid hydrocarbons, the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British <b>Gas</b> <b>metering</b> station to Feeder No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur {{in the form of}} a froth. The froth was dried in a rotary vacuum filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130°C from where it was removed by heated road tanker. The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by road tanker.|$|E

[...] Ukraine {{agreed to}} guarantee the unfettered transport of natural gas {{on the condition that}} Gazprom would guarantee and supply technical gas for Ukraine's gas transit system to function; this was denied by Russia. The supplies to Europe were not restored although the European Union, Ukraine, and Russia agreed to the deployment of an international monitoring group to the <b>gas</b> <b>metering</b> stations between Russia and Ukraine. [...] Naftohaz blocked the transit of gas, blaming a lack of pressure in the pipeline system and saying the design of the Soviet-built pipeline meant it could not ship gas entering through the Sudzha metering station governing gas leaving through the Orlivka metering station without cutting off the Donetsk region, Luhansk region, and portions of the Dnipropetrovsk region of Ukraine.

40|$|Two {{different}} methods for measuring biogas production were used, <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> and gasbags. The <b>gas</b> <b>meters</b> were electronic and counted {{each time a}} certain gasvolume passed through them. The gasbags collected the gas that hade passed through the <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> until a manual measuring could be done. The two {{different methods}} gave the same result for a volume at three liters but for a volume around 0, 2 liters they did not. Accuracy and precision for the gasbags was more exact than for the <b>gas</b> <b>meters</b> even if the method was difficult {{with a lot of}} different elements that could affect the result. The gasbag method was more complicated and took longer time than the <b>gas</b> <b>meter,</b> which was an easy working technic that wasn´t time consuming. But both of the methods gave a fall off. For the gasbags the values falled off because of leakage and for the <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> it falled off because of dubble counting and that the meters stopped count for a while. The advantage of the gasbags is that you can measure the gas total compound. The benefit of the <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> is that you can measure changes in the gas flow over time...|$|R
