5|$|Four Native American {{cultures}} {{are known to}} have lived in the area during the last 10,000years. The first known group, the Nevares Spring People, were hunters and gatherers who arrived in the area perhaps 9,000years ago (7000BC) when there were still small lakes in Death Valley and neighboring Panamint Valley. A much milder climate persisted at that time, and large game animals were still plentiful. By 5,000years ago (3000BC) the Mesquite Flat People displaced the Nevares Spring People. Around 2,000years ago the Saratoga Spring People moved into the area, which by then was probably already a hot, dry desert. This culture was more advanced at hunting and gathering and was skillful at <b>handcrafts.</b> They also left mysterious stone patterns in the valley.|$|E

Extracting linear structures, such {{as blood}} vessels or dendrites, from images {{is crucial in}} many medical imagery applications, and many <b>handcrafted</b> {{features}} have been proposed to solve this problem. However, such features rely on assumptions that are never entirely true. Learned features, on the other hand, can capture image characteristics difficult to define analytically, but tend to be much slower to compute than <b>handcrafted</b> features. We propose to complement <b>handcrafted</b> methods with features found using very recent Machine Learning techniques, and we show that even few filters are sufficient to efficiently leverage <b>handcrafted</b> features. We demonstrate our approach on the STARE, DRIVE, and BF 2 D datasets, and on 2 D projections of neural images from the DIADEM challenge. Our proposal outperforms <b>handcrafted</b> methods, and pairs up with learning-only approaches {{at a fraction of}} their computational cost. ...|$|R
