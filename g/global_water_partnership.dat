40|$|Water and its {{management}} is becoming {{not just a}} local but a global priority. The UN Rio+ 20 Declaration emphasises the need to establish a green economy as the means to achieving sustainable development while protecting and improving the world’s natural resources. Water is increasingly seen as a central plank of the green economy. It is embedded {{in all aspects of}} development – food security, health, and poverty reduction – and in sustaining economic growth in agriculture, industry, and energy generation. A GWP Perspectives Paper is intended to galvanise discussion within the network and the larger water and development community. Feedback will contribute to future GWP Technical Committee publications on related issues. www. gwp. org www. gwptoolbox. org PERSPECTIVES PAPER The <b>Global</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Partnership’s</b> vision is for a water secure world. Its mission is to support the sustainable development and management of water resources at all levels. GWP is a global network of 13 Regional <b>Water</b> <b>Partnerships,</b> 80 Country <b>Water</b> <b>Partnerships</b> and more than 2, 500 Partner organisations in 164 countries. GWP was founded in 1996 by the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) to foster integrated water resource management (IWRM). IWRM is the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of eco-systems and the environment. The network is open to all organisations involved in water resources management: developed and developing country government institutions, agencies of the United Nations, bi- and multi-lateral development banks, professional associations, research institutions, non-governmental organisations, and the private sector.

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, the Indonesian {{government}} and international development agencies have ranked the Citarum River among the most polluted rivers in the world. Pollution, flooding, sedimentation, deforestation and over-pumping of ground water, combined with inadequate policy enforcement and poor coordination between government agencies are compromising Indonesian livelihoods.  In 2007, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loaned Indonesia $ 500 million to implement “Integrated Water Resources Management” (IWRM) as a “best practices” management intervention to solve the “crisis” by “making decisions at the lowest appropriate level. ” To appraise IWRM success, this paper explores, (1) historical trajectories leading to water privatization measures and IWRM; (2) integration of “local ground realities” during West Tarum Canal (WTC) project implementation by IWRM managers; (3) which “local ground realities” implementers must consider as IWRM enters the peri-urban village of Sukamaju. Methodologically, I draw upon IWRM literature, <b>Global</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Partnership’s</b> (GWP) IWRM-ToolBox, Dublin Principle II, ADB planning documents, a two-month water pollution field investigation in Sukamaju, and personal interviews of residents, management officials, and government leaders. Lower basin findings show failures to effectively resettle and compensate residents.   Upper basin findings reveal a complex water pollution problem entangled in livelihood and policy contradictions, leading to persistent pollution. My findings demonstrate that IWRM rhetoric borrows heavily from Dublin Principle II and GWP, and that IWRM management practices are inadequately informed by local realities.   This investigation aims to aid implementers by critiquing past failures so that project officials can address future challenges as IWRM makes its way throughout Indonesia...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how {{new types of}} water governance institutions, <b>water</b> <b>partnerships,</b> emerged and performed in Korea, a centralised state-driven society. Beyond conventional water management by either government or market, new forms of governance have been sought to address problems such as under-provision, pollution and water conflict. This study investigates voluntary <b>water</b> <b>partnerships</b> as a leading example of new water governance in East Asia. Conceptually, it uses a modified institutional approach, the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, to examine how <b>global</b> <b>water</b> reform discourses informed social actors {{in the design and}} implementation of regional and urban <b>water</b> <b>partnerships</b> in Korea. A comparative case analysis of six <b>water</b> <b>partnerships</b> finds that co-governance institutions emerged and operated in a complex linkage with existing water governance systems. For the three urban <b>water</b> <b>partnerships,</b> local actors actively seized opportunities to rehabilitate long abandoned urban streams. For the three regional <b>water</b> <b>partnerships,</b> public and private sector actors successfully negotiated partnership agreements, focusing on the restoration of polluted water sources. A modified IAD framework captured these complicated interactions among stakeholders within multi-layered water governance structures. An attitudinal survey of partnership members complemented the comparative case studies by assessing how the partnerships performed according to selected evaluation criteria. A multi-criteria assessment of the data reveals three key findings. First, the partnerships achieved mainly positive procedural and socio-economic outcomes in water management. Second, observed lower environmental outcomes result mainly from the interlinked features of water resources management and the partnerships’ relatively brief history. Third, the overall findings indicate that the outcomes of co-governance institutions tended to be contextual. The scale of organisations and of the water resources concerned did not determine the outcomes of the <b>water</b> <b>partnerships.</b> Thus, this finding challenges the claim that ‘smaller is better’ in collaborative governance. This study concludes that the voluntary co-management of shared water resources by the six partnerships have simultaneously brought some solutions as well as costs to water governance in Korea. The design and development of co-management institutions for water governance requires a greater understanding of local and national settings, as well as the facilitative role of national government. Co-operation between new co-governance institutions and existing water institutions is vital to long-term, effective water management...|$|R

40|$|On the {{one hand}} <b>global</b> <b>water</b> {{governance}} {{is one of the}} most active policy fields in the realm of sustainable development, while the <b>global</b> <b>water</b> crisis and its phenomena are reasonably well understood. On the other hand <b>global</b> <b>water</b> governance still lacks institutionalization and is often referred to as,diffuse‘ and,fragmented‘. Furthermore, the scientific community has added only little to a better understanding of <b>global</b> <b>water</b> governance, so that it can be seen as a,blind spot‘ in the governance research agenda. That is the challenge addressed by this thesis. In its,applied mode‘ the thesis proves the presumption of its author; namely that the characterization of <b>global</b> <b>water</b> governance as,diffuse‘ and ultimately,ineffective‘ runs at least in part counter to the reality of <b>global</b> <b>water</b> governance of the past 30 years. In order to analyze the <b>global</b> dimension of <b>water</b> governance, regime theory will be used as the analytical framework. Describing <b>global</b> <b>water</b> governance as a <b>global</b> <b>water</b> regime allows new light to be shed on this policy field and to understand it as, by and large, a coordinated collective effort addressing the looming <b>global</b> <b>water</b> crisis. Hence, this dissertation may lead to a revaluation of <b>global</b> <b>water</b> governance by the (water) governance research community, as well as providing advice for practitioners dealing with future institutionalization processes in <b>global</b> <b>water</b> governance. The overarching scientific interest relates to a better understanding and explanation of institution and regime building processes in <b>global</b> <b>water</b> governance. A normative-ethical foundation for the role of institutions is briefly presented, too. The thesis then continues with its main research question: Is current <b>global</b> <b>water</b> governance already a <b>global</b> <b>water</b> regime as defined by regime theory? The final answer to this question depends on the theoretical understanding and conceptualization of regimes. If a,classic‘ understanding of regimes is employed – one that refers to legally binding regulatory institutional arrangements between nation states – the answer may be negative. However, if the regime framing can address,soft law‘, other actors than the nation state (while not dismissing the nation state), as well as regime functions other than regulation, a positive answer should be expected. The dissertation accordingly establishes this. In order to address its fundamental research question, the dissertation thoroughly reconstructs the genesis of <b>global</b> <b>water</b> governance over the past 30 years. Besides the incorporation of insights from governance research of the past 20 years, the dissertation develops and applies an integrative theory of regime formation, building on recent developments in regime theory, that allows for a logically coherent application of different,schools of thoughts‘ in regime theory in order to better understand and explain <b>global</b> <b>water</b> governance as a process of regime formation...|$|R

Through a business case centered on sustainability performance, risk management and productivity and through implementation of a strategic framework based on a water mass balance at the enterprise level, industry can take actions that support restoration of a sustainable water balance at the community and watershed levels while also generating business value for that particular enterprise. Within this framework, the volume of consumptive water use is used to establish the target water volume that an enterprise would balance through implementation of community <b>water</b> <b>partnerships</b> (CWP) that provide water access and sanitation, watershed restoration and protection, and water for productive use benefits. Quantification of CWP project benefits is achieved either through metering or standard methods known and accepted by the engineering, conservation, and social science professions. A 100 % sustainable balance is achieved when an enterprise implements a portfolio of locally relevant CWPs that collectively produce an annual volumetric benefit equivalent to the annual volume of consumptive water use for that particular enterprise.
