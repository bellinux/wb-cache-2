50|$|The {{vertical}} alignment (or {{profile in the}} United States, but {{not to be confused}} with rail profile) is the surface uniformity in the vertical plane. The measurement of uniformity is done using a predefined length of string line (normally the same length used in horizontal alignment) along the track. If the midpoint of the measurement has higher elevation, it is <b>called</b> hump <b>deviation.</b> On the other hand, if the midpoint has lower elevation, it is <b>called</b> dip <b>deviation.</b>|$|R

It has been presented in the literature that there exists more than one balanced circular formation when the agents are following cyclic pursuit strategy.

The modified strategy is called deviated cyclic pursuit. Monte Carlo simulations {{has been carried out}} to find the range of deviation angle where a unique equilibrium formation exists...|$|R

N is released fairly quickly from residue when the content is higher than 1.5 per cent (such as in pea residues).

This {{should not be confused with}} the midposition of the hand which corresponds to an ulnar deviation of 12 degrees. From the straight position two pairs of movements of the hand are possible: abduction (movement towards the radius, so <b>called</b> radial <b>deviation</b> or abduction) of 15 degrees and adduction (movement towards the ulna, so <b>called</b> ulnar <b>deviation</b> or adduction) of 40 degrees when the arm is in strict supination and slightly greater in strict pronation.|$|R
50|$|The {{contemporary}} {{compass rose}} appears as two rings, one smaller and set inside the other. The outside ring denotes true cardinal directions while the smaller inside ring denotes magnetic cardinal directions. True north {{refers to the}} geographical location of the north pole while magnetic north refers to the direction towards which the north pole of a magnetic object (as found in a compass) will point. The angular difference between true and magnetic north is called variation, which varies depending on location. The angular difference between magnetic heading and compass heading is <b>called</b> <b>deviation</b> which varies by vessel and its heading.|$|R

40|$|Attribute {{reduction}} {{is the process}} of selecting a minimal attribute subset from a problem domain while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original attributes. In this work, we propose a new attribute reduction algorithm called record-to-record travel (RRT) algorithm and employ a rough set theory as a mathematical tool to evaluate the quality of the obtained solutions. RRT is an optimization algorithm that is inspired from simulated annealing, which depends on a single parameter <b>called</b> <b>DEVIATION.</b> Experimental results on 13 well known UCI datasets show that the proposed method, coded as RRTAR, is comparable with other rough set-based attribute reduction methods available in the literature...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an efficient method to compare two triangular meshes. Meshes considered here contain geometric features {{as well as}} other surface attributes such as material colors, texture, temperature, radiation, etc. Two deviation measurements are presented to assess the differences between two meshes. The first measurement, <b>called</b> geometric <b>deviation,</b> returns geometric differences. The second measurement, <b>called</b> attribute <b>deviation,</b> returns attribute differences regardless of the attribute type. In this paper we present an application of this method to the Mesh Simplification Algorithm (MSA) quality assessment according to the appearance attributes. This assessment allows the appreciation of local quality and the computation of global quality statistics of a simplified mesh...|$|R
