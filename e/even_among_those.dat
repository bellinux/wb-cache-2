In 1533 the chapter-general elected Vermigli abbot of the two Lateran monasteries in Spoleto. At this post he was also responsible for two convents. The discipline in the monastic houses in Vermigli's care had been lax before his arrival, and they had {{become a source of}} scandal in Spoleto. There was also a history of power struggle between the Bishop of Spoleto, Francesco Eroli, and the Spoletan abbacy, {{to the point that the}} bishop had excommunicated Vermigli's predecessor, only to be overturned by Rome.

5|$|The monarchy fell at a {{point when}} it had reached its highest {{popularity}} among Brazilians, {{due in part to}} the abolition of slavery on 13 May 1888. Indifferent to the new heroes, such as Tiradentes, imposed by the new republican government, Brazilians remained attached to the popular Emperor whom they regarded as a hero. He continued to be thought of as a national symbol, the Father of the People personified. This view was <b>even</b> stronger <b>among</b> <b>those</b> of African descent, who equated the monarchy with freedom.

50|$|The rich {{research}} on treatment of PTSDs in veterans has substantially informed treatment offered to torture survivors. It is more appropriate than extrapolation from work with civilian survivors of single events as individuals (assault, accidents) or as communities or groups (natural or man-made disasters). Some literature distinguishes between single-event trauma (type 1) and prolonged and repeated trauma, such as torture (type 2). There {{is no doubt}} that (disregarding concerns about the diagnosis) rates of PTSD are much higher in refugees than among people of a similar age in the countries where the refugees settle, and that, among refugees, rates of PTSD are <b>even</b> higher <b>among</b> <b>those</b> seeking asylum.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{labor force}} re-entry after retirement {{in an effort}} to understand whether these "unretirement" transitions are largely unexpected (perhaps resulting from failures in planning or unexpected financial shocks) or planned (perhaps representing a more complex retirement process). Nearly one-half of retirees follow a nontraditional retirement path that involves partial retirement and/or unretirement, and the unretirement rate <b>among</b> <b>those</b> observed at least five years after their first retirement is 24 percent. The unretirement rate is <b>even</b> higher <b>among</b> <b>those</b> retiring at younger ages (as high as 36 percent <b>among</b> <b>those</b> retiring at ages 51 - 52). I find that unretirement was anticipated for all but nine percent of retirees. If anything, expectations {{err on the side of}} excessive pessimism about the future rather than unwarranted optimism. Unretirement appears to be qualitatively similar to partial retirement and there is some evidence of a substantial correlation in the post-retirement labor supply transitions of married couples...|$|R

For the next several decades, after the famine, Europe took on a tougher and more violent edge; it became an even less amicable place than during the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries. This could be seen across all segments of society, perhaps most strikingly in the way warfare was conducted in the fourteenth century during the Hundred Years' War, when chivalry ended, {{as opposed to the}} twelfth and the thirteenth centuries when nobles were more likely to die by accident in tournament games than on the field of battle.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} infections {{of the mouth}} {{include the use of}} {{chlorhexidine}} mouth wash in those with poor immune function and washing out the mouth following the use of inhaled steroids. Little evidence supports probiotics for either prevention or treatment <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> with frequent vaginal infections. For infections of the mouth, treatment with topical clotrimazole or nystatin is usually effective. By mouth or intravenous fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B may be used if these do not work. A number of topical antifungal medications may be used for vaginal infections including clotrimazole. In those with widespread disease, an echinocandin such as caspofungin or micafungin is used. A number of weeks of intravenous amphotericin B may be used as an alternative. In certain groups at very high risk, antifungal medications may be used preventatively.|$|E
25|$|While many Jewish {{holidays}} {{revolve around}} the synagogue, the Seder is conducted in the family home, although communal Seders are also organized by synagogues, schools and community centers, some open to the general public. It is customary to invite guests, especially strangers and the needy. The Seder is integral to Jewish faith and identity: as explained in the Haggadah, if not for divine intervention and the Exodus, the Jewish people would still be slaves in Egypt. Therefore, the Seder is an occasion for praise and thanksgiving and for re-dedication {{to the idea of}} liberation. Furthermore, the words and rituals of the Seder are a primary vehicle for the transmission of the Jewish faith from grandparent to child, and {{from one generation to the}} next. Attending a Seder and eating matza on Passover is a widespread custom in the Jewish community, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> who are not religiously observant.|$|E

25|$|Yeltsin {{ordered the}} Russian Army to show restraint, {{but it was}} neither {{prepared}} nor trained for this. Civilian losses quickly mounted, alienating the Chechen population and raising the hostility that they showed towards the Russian forces, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> who initially supported the Russians' attempts to unseat Dudayev. Other problems occurred as Yeltsin sent in freshly-trained conscripts from neighboring regions rather than regular soldiers. Highly mobile units of Chechen fighters inflicted severe losses on the ill-prepared and demoralized Russian troops. Although the Russian military command ordered to only attack designated targets, {{due to the lack}} of training and experience of Russian forces, they attacked random positions instead, turning into carpet bombing and indiscriminate barrages of rocket artillery, and causing enormous casualties among the Chechen and Russian civilian population. On 29 December, in a rare instance of a Russian outright victory, the Russian airborne forces seized the military airfield next to Grozny and repelled a Chechen armoured counter-attack in the Battle of Khankala; the next objective was the city itself. With the Russians closing in on the capital, the Chechens began to hastily set up defensive fighting positions and grouped their forces in the city.|$|E
25|$|An additional, though smaller, {{number of}} Bulgarian Muslims, {{also from the}} Central and Eastern Rhodopes, have {{converted}} into Orthodox Christianity or have adopted a Christian identity since 1990. The process of conversion has affected mostly Muslim Bulgarians living among or next to ethnic Turks, i.e. the regions of Nedelino, Kirkovo, Zlatograd and Krumovgrad. In some cases, the conversion has affected whole villages, which have adopted a Christian Bulgarian identity, {{as in the case}} of Zabardo in the Chepelare Municipality or the younger generations in a village, as in the case with the village of Pripek in the Dzhebel Municipality. Bulgarian and Christian names are common, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> who do not espouse a Christian identity, in particular, in the Eastern Rhodopes. For example, only one-third of the Muslim Bulgarian population of the region of Kirkovo, mostly people aged over 60, have Muslim names. Another tendency in the last years is for younger people to restore their Bulgarian names for the purpose of working abroad or studying in the country, as in the village of Varbina in the Municipality of Madan where 475 out of 1,160 residents have recently changed their names to Bulgarian and Christian ones.|$|E

40|$|In {{so far as}} legislators value re-election, electoral {{institutions}} are said to shape their strategic behavior.

Previous studies, we argue, have either ignored or misspecified how legislators? vulnerability to electoral defeat mediates the expected effect of electoral institutions. To test this argument, we develop and operationalize a new comparative measure of electoral vulnerability which we combine with new individual-level data on legislators? constituency effort in 14 (mostly European) countries.
