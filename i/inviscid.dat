5|$|The {{thickness}} of the velocity boundary layer is normally defined as {{the distance from the}} solid body to {{the point at which the}} viscous flow velocity is 99% of the freestream velocity (the surface velocity of an <b>inviscid</b> flow). Displacement Thickness is an alternative definition stating that the boundary layer represents a deficit in mass flow compared to <b>inviscid</b> flow with slip at the wall. It is the distance by which the wall would have to be displaced in the <b>inviscid</b> case to give the same total mass flow as the viscous case. The no-slip condition requires the flow velocity at the surface of a solid object be zero and the fluid temperature be equal to the temperature of the surface. The flow velocity will then increase rapidly within the boundary layer, governed by the boundary layer equations, below.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, high Reynolds numbers (Re>>1) {{indicate}} that the inertial effects have more effect on the velocity field than the viscous (friction) effects. In high Reynolds number flows, the flow is often modeled as an <b>inviscid</b> flow, an approximation in which viscosity is completely neglected. Eliminating viscosity allows the Navier–Stokes equations to be simplified into the Euler equations. The integration of the Euler equations along a streamline in an <b>inviscid</b> flow yields Bernoulli's equation. When, {{in addition to being}} <b>inviscid,</b> the flow is irrotational everywhere, Bernoulli's equation can completely describe the flow everywhere. Such flows are called potential flows, because the velocity field may be expressed as the gradient of a potential energy expression.|$|E
25|$|The {{three main}} {{assumptions}} in the derivation of d'Alembert's paradox {{is that the}} steady flow is incompressible, <b>inviscid</b> and irrotational.|$|E
25|$|In fluid dynamics, a Stokes wave is a {{non-linear}} and periodic {{surface wave}} on an <b>inviscid</b> fluid layer of constant mean depth.|$|E
25|$|The shallow-water {{equations}} {{can be used}} {{to describe}} a layer of relatively <b>inviscid</b> fluid with a free surface, in which surface gradients are small.|$|E
25|$|However, {{when the}} flow problem {{is put into}} a non-dimensional form, the viscous Navier–Stokes {{equations}} converge for increasing Reynolds numbers towards the <b>inviscid</b> Euler equations, suggesting that the flow should converge towards the <b>inviscid</b> solutions of potential flow theory – having the zero drag of the d'Alembert paradox. Of this, {{there is no evidence}} found in experimental measurements of drag and flow visualisations. This again raised questions concerning the applicability of fluid mechanics {{in the second half of}} the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In the Eulerian forms it is {{apparent}} that the assumption of an <b>inviscid</b> fluid, or no deviatoric stress, brings Cauchy equations to the Euler equations.|$|E
25|$|In modern {{everyday}} life {{there are many}} observations that can be successfully explained by application of Bernoulli's principle, even though no real fluid is entirely <b>inviscid</b> and a small viscosity often has a large effect on the flow.|$|E
25|$|From Bernoulli's principle, this Lagrangian {{can be seen}} to be the {{integral}} of the fluid pressure over the whole time-dependent fluid domain V(t). This is in agreement with the variational principles for <b>inviscid</b> flow without a free surface, found by Harry Bateman.|$|E
25|$|All real fluids (except superfluids) {{offer some}} {{resistance}} to shearing and therefore are viscous. For teaching and explanatory purposes {{it is helpful to}} use the concept of an <b>inviscid</b> fluid or an ideal fluid which offers no {{resistance to shearing}} and so is not viscous.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of viscosity on the flow dictates a third classification. Some problems may encounter only very small viscous effects, {{in which case}} viscosity can {{be considered to be}} negligible. The approximations to these problems are called <b>inviscid</b> flows. Flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called viscous flows.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} equations outline a fully three-dimensional mathematical {{problem that}} {{is very difficult to}} solve even with simplifying assumptions. Until recently, limitations in computational power, forced these equations to be simplified to an <b>Inviscid</b> two-dimensional problem with pseudo losses. Before the advent of computers, these equations were almost always simplified to a one-dimensional problem.|$|E
25|$|In fluid dynamics, Airy wave theory (often {{referred}} to as linear wave theory) gives a linearised description of the propagation of gravity waves {{on the surface of}} a homogeneous fluid layer. The theory assumes that the fluid layer has a uniform mean depth, and that the fluid flow is <b>inviscid,</b> incompressible and irrotational. This theory was first published, in correct form, by George Biddell Airy in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In physics, {{there are}} several systems whose {{dynamical}} equations resemble the equations of motion of a gyrostat. Examples include a solid body with a cavity filled with an <b>inviscid,</b> incompressible, homogeneous liquid, the static equilibrium configuration of a stressed elastic rod in elastica theory, the polarization dynamics of a light pulse propagating through a nonlinear medium, the Lorenz system in chaos theory, and the motion of an ion in a Penning trap mass spectrometer.|$|E
25|$|In fluid dynamics, Luke's variational {{principle}} is a Lagrangian variational {{description of the}} motion of surface waves on a fluid with a free surface, under the action of gravity. This {{principle is}} named after J.C. Luke, who published it in 1967. This variational principle is for incompressible and <b>inviscid</b> potential flows, and is used to derive approximate wave models like the so-called mild-slope equation, or using the averaged Lagrangian approach for wave propagation in inhomogeneous media.|$|E
25|$|Subsonic (or low-speed) {{aerodynamics}} describes fluid {{motion in}} flows which are {{much lower than}} the speed of sound everywhere in the flow. There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is <b>inviscid,</b> incompressible and irrotational. This case is called potential flow and allows the differential equations that describe the flow to be a simplified version of the equations of fluid dynamics, thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions.|$|E
25|$|Another paradox due to {{mathematical}} idealization is D'Alembert's {{paradox of}} fluid mechanics. When the forces associated with two-dimensional, incompressible, irrotational, <b>inviscid</b> steady flow across a body are calculated, {{there is no}} drag. This is in contradiction with observations of such flows, but {{as it turns out}} a fluid that rigorously satisfies all the conditions is a physical impossibility. The mathematical model breaks down at the surface of the body, and new solutions involving boundary layers have to be considered to correctly model the drag effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Inviscid</b> flow {{was further}} {{analyzed}} by various mathematicians (Leonhard Euler, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Joseph Louis Lagrange, Pierre-Simon Laplace, Siméon Denis Poisson) and viscous flow was explored by {{a multitude of}} engineers including Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille and Gotthilf Hagen. Further mathematical justification was provided by Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes in the Navier–Stokes equations, and boundary layers were investigated (Ludwig Prandtl, Theodore von Kármán), while various scientists such as Osborne Reynolds, Andrey Kolmogorov, and Geoffrey Ingram Taylor advanced the understanding of fluid viscosity and turbulence.|$|E
25|$|Viscosity is {{associated}} with the frictional forces in a flow. In some flow fields, viscous effects are very small, and approximate solutions may safely neglect viscous effects. These approximations are called <b>inviscid</b> flows. Flows for which viscosity is not neglected are called viscous flows. Finally, aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment. External aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes (e.g. around an airplane wing), while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages inside solid objects (e.g. through a jet engine).|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, Munk {{investigated}} {{irregularities in}} the Earth's rotation, {{such as the}} Chandler wobble and annual and long-term changes in the length of day (rate of the Earth's rotation), to see how these were related to geophysical processes such as {{the changes in the}} atmosphere, ocean, and core, and the energy dissipated by tidal acceleration. He also investigated how western boundary currents, such as the Gulf Stream, dissipated planetary vorticity. His <b>inviscid</b> theory of these currents did not have a time invariant solution; no simple solution to this problem has ever been found.|$|E
25|$|This idea {{can work}} fairly well when the Reynolds number is high. However, {{problems}} such as those involving solid boundaries may require that the viscosity be included. Viscosity cannot be neglected near solid boundaries because the no-slip condition generates a thin region of large strain rate, the boundary layer, in which viscosity effects dominate and which thus generates vorticity. Therefore, to calculate net forces on bodies (such as wings), viscous flow equations must be used: <b>inviscid</b> flow theory fails to predict drag forces, a limitation known as the d'Alembert's paradox.|$|E
25|$|Airy wave theory uses a {{potential}} flow (or velocity potential) approach {{to describe the}} motion of gravity waves on a fluid surface. The use of – <b>inviscid</b> and irrotational – potential flow in water waves is remarkably successful, given its failure to describe many other fluid flows where it is often essential to take viscosity, vorticity, turbulence and/or flow separation into account. This {{is due to the}} fact that for the oscillatory part of the fluid motion, wave-induced vorticity is restricted to some thin oscillatory Stokes boundary layers at the boundaries of the fluid domain.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{an ideal}} <b>inviscid</b> fluid, a viscous flow past a cylinder, {{no matter how}} small the viscosity, will acquire {{vorticity}} in a thin boundary layer adjacent to the cylinder. [...] Boundary layer separation can occur, and a trailing wake will occur behind the cylinder. [...] The pressure will be lower on the wake side of the cylinder, than on the upstream side, resulting in a drag force in the downstream direction.|$|E

500|$|The thermal {{boundary}} layer thickness is similarly {{the distance from}} the body at which the temperature is 99% of the temperature found from an <b>inviscid</b> solution.

[...] If the Prandtl number is greater than 1, the {{thermal boundary}} layer is thinner than the velocity boundary layer. If the Prandtl number is less than 1, which is the case for air at standard conditions, the thermal boundary layer is thicker than the velocity boundary layer.|$|E
500|$|The {{deduction}} {{of the boundary}} layer equations {{was one of the}} most important advances in fluid dynamics. Using an order of magnitude analysis, the well-known governing Navier–Stokes equations of viscous fluid flow can be greatly simplified within the boundary layer. Notably, the characteristic of the partial differential equations (PDE) becomes parabolic, rather than the elliptical form of the full Navier–Stokes equations. This greatly simplifies the solution of the equations. By making the boundary layer approximation, the flow is divided into an <b>inviscid</b> portion (which is easy to solve by a number of methods) and the boundary layer, which is governed by an easier to solve PDE. The continuity and Navier–Stokes equations for a two-dimensional steady incompressible flow in Cartesian coordinates are given by ...|$|E

In some cases, the mathematics of a fluid mechanical system can be treated by assuming that the fluid outside of boundary layers is <b>inviscid,</b> and then matching its solution onto that for a thin laminar boundary layer.|$|E
