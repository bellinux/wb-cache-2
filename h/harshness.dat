5|$|Hardly any Zoroastrian {{family was}} able to avoid {{conversion}} to Islam when employed by the Abbasids. Because of their <b>harshness</b> towards unbelievers, and due to their lavish patronage of Persian Muslims, the Abbasids proved to be deadly foes of Zoroastrianism.|$|E
5|$|In 68 AD,, Nero's {{successor}} Galba, despite public feeling, rewarded Halotus with a procuratorship. Galba {{ordered an}} edict relating to Tigellinus, another servant who had possibly {{been involved in}} the murder of Claudius and whose death was also being called for among the Romans, rebuking the public for their <b>harshness</b> and outrage.|$|E
5|$|The French {{suffered}} {{in the course of}} a ruinous retreat, including from the <b>harshness</b> of the Russian Winter. The Armée had begun as over 400,000 frontline troops, with fewer than 40,000 crossing the Berezina River in November 1812. The Russians had lost 150,000 in battle and hundreds of thousands of civilians.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} mixed reviews, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers praised the game's art design and criticized the <b>harshness</b> of its gameplay mechanics, particularly its unpredictable deaths, ruthless enemies, and time-consuming hibernation requirements. Eurogamer compared its savage, survival elements to the 2012 Tokyo Jungle.|$|E
5|$|Beginning as a supporter, Greeley {{soon became}} disillusioned with President Johnson, whose Reconstruction {{policies}} allowed the quick formation of state governments without provision for suffrage for the freedman. When Congress convened and gradually {{took control of}} Reconstruction, Greeley generally supported their actions, favoring universal male suffrage and, his anger against the Confederates having cooled, amnesty. While Greeley generally supported the Radical Republicans, {{he did not like}} the <b>harshness</b> of Thaddeus Stevens. Greeley ran for Congress in 1866, but lost badly, and for Senate in the legislative election held in early 1867, to be defeated by Roscoe Conkling.|$|E
5|$|More recent performances, led by {{conductors}} Pierre Boulez, Edo de Waart and Sixten Ehrling, {{have been}} acknowledged {{to show the}} music in a more positive light. Nevertheless, the overall reputation of the music remains mixed. Some critics, including composer John Adams, have remained critical {{of the work and}} considered Copland's use of serial techniques detrimental to his later music. Others, which include critics Michael Andrews and Peter Davis, have seen Connotations as proof of Copland's continued growth and inventiveness as a composer while not downplaying the work's melodic and harmonic <b>harshness</b> and potential difficulty overall for listeners.|$|E
5|$|The {{chapters}} of the book covered in this episode are Bran IV (less the first few pages that {{were included in the}} previous episode), Eddard V, Jon IV, Eddard VI, Catelyn V, Sansa II, Daenerys IV (chapters 25–30 and 37). Among the scenes created for the show, there are the conversations between Theon and Tyrion, Sansa and Septa Mordane, Doreah and Viserys, Jory Cassel and Jaime, Jon and Samwell and Eddard Stark and Cersei. The character of Alliser Thorne is given some more depth by justifying his <b>harshness</b> towards the new recruits, and a more subdued version of Bran's dream is included.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{unreliable}} {{nature of}} the troops loyal to the NDH government, Phleps utilised Chetnik forces as auxiliaries, stating to a visiting officer {{that he could not}} disarm the Chetniks unless the NDH government provided him with the same strength in reliable troops. In January 1944, due to fears that the Western Allies would invade along the Dalmatian coastline and islands, V SS Mountain Corps forced the mass evacuation of male civilians between the ages of 17 and 50 from that area. Phleps was criticised by both NDH and German authorities for the <b>harshness</b> with which the evacuation was carried out. During {{the first six months of}} 1944, elements of the V SS Mountain Corps were involved in Operation Waldrausch (Forest Fever) in central Bosnia, Operation Maibaum (Maypole) in eastern Bosnia, and Operation Rösselsprung (Knight's Move), the attempt to capture or kill the Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Princess is {{one example}} of an attempt by an artist of the early 19th Century to define an American {{national}} identity. Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as foster mother, protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, nurturing and legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation’s history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the <b>harshness</b> and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through the Pocahontas myth.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the <b>harshness</b> of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
5|$|Seaborgium is {{the fourth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 6 in the periodic table, below chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten. All {{the members of the}} group form a diversity of oxoanions. They readily portray their group oxidation state of +6, although this is highly oxidising in the case of chromium, and this state becomes more and more stable to reduction as the group is descended: indeed, tungsten is the last of the 5d transition metals where all four 5d electrons participate in metallic bonding. As such, seaborgium should have +6 as its most stable oxidation state, both in the gas phase and in aqueous solution, and this is the only oxidation state that is experimentally known for it; the +5 and +4 states should be less stable and the +3 state, the most common for chromium, would be the least stable for seaborgium. Experimental chemical investigation has been hampered due to the need to produce seaborgium one atom at a time, its short half-life, and the resulting necessary <b>harshness</b> of the experimental conditions.|$|E
5|$|When the new see at Ely was {{established}} in 1109 in a former abbey, it was carved out of Bloet's diocese who was compensated for the loss by a grant of land. This grant included the town of Spaldwick in Huntingdonshire. He {{was one of the}} councillors who urged Henry to appoint William of Corbeil to the archbishopric of Canterbury in 1123, although Bloet died before Corbeil was selected. Bloet was opposed to the other candidates, as they were monks, and he wanted a non-monk appointed at Canterbury. In 1114, when Canterbuy was vacant, he had also opposed the appointment of a monk to Canterbury. During the reign of Henry, Bloet accepted the supervision of St Albans abbey, ruled by his relative Richard, when Richard objected to the <b>harshness</b> of the archbishop of Canterbury and switched the abbey's obedience to Lincoln instead. Bloet continued to be a benefactor to Albans throughout his episcopate. He doubled the number of canons in the cathedral chapter at Lincoln Cathedral during his episcopate. He also embellished the newly built Lincoln Cathedral and gave the cathedral many gifts of objects and lands. Most of his surviving episcopal documents concern the consecration of churches in his diocese or the confirmation of donations to religious houses. He also founded a hospital in Lincoln dedicated to the Holy Sepulchre.|$|E
5|$|In Higueras, Cerezeda became ill, and {{lacked the}} ability to provide strong leadership. He was unable to expand the conquered area, and the Spanish treated the {{indigenous}} population with customary <b>harshness,</b> resulting in population decline as the natives either succumbed to their ruthless treatment, or fled into the hills. The natives that remained were increasingly hostile, and refuse to work for their encomendero overlords. This resistance crystallised around Sicumba; ever more indigenous warriors rallied to his cause, and areas that had been superficially conquered rose up in arms against the Spanish. Areas that had previously fallen to the Spanish were lost, and they were encircled in a small region centred on Buena Esperanza. The colonists were demoralised, fearing a massive Indian attack at any moment, and were desperately short of provisions since the encomienda towns refused to supply them. The colonists openly questioned Cerezeda's leadership, and new factions formed, with treasurer Diego García de Solís leading the opposition. Rumours of the riches of Peru lured Spaniards away from the faltering colony in Honduras-Higueras, and forty or fifty men deserted in search of better fortune elsewhere. Although precious metals had been discovered close to Buena Esperanza, {{it was impossible to}} mine them due to the hostility of the Indians. In spite of Cerezeda's opposition, García de Solís appealed directly to the governor of Guatemala, Pedro de Alvarado, who had recently returned from Ecuador. Such was the desperate situation that García de Solís travelled personally to Guatemala with ten soldiers, leaving Buena Esperanza in October 1535, and arriving in Santiago de Guatemala in late November.|$|E

25|$|Description: A sweet, mild {{sounding}} baritone voice, lacking <b>harshness.</b> Many lyric baritone roles {{call for}} some fioritura and coloratura, a beautiful line, {{as well as}} a charismatic presence.|$|E
25|$|In music, consonance and dissonance are categorizations of {{simultaneous}} or successive sounds. Consonance {{is associated}} with sweetness, pleasantness, and acceptability; dissonance {{is associated with}} <b>harshness,</b> unpleasantness, or unacceptability.|$|E
25|$|There is {{relatively}} little livestock raised {{due to the}} <b>harshness</b> of the land, {{but most of the}} livestock is pigs followed by goats. There are 54,895 hectares used as natural pasture with 79 hectares are seeded.|$|E
25|$|Prince Nikolai Andreich Bolkonsky: The {{father of}} Andrei and Maria, the {{eccentric}} prince possesses a gruff exterior and displays great insensitivity {{to the emotional}} needs of his children. Nevertheless, his <b>harshness</b> often belies hidden depth of feeling.|$|E
25|$|The design still {{emphasizes}} {{power and}} luxury, with significant work done on improving noise, vibration, and <b>harshness</b> (NVH). However, {{for the first}} time, Jeep also emphasized on-road performance to a similar extent as the cornerstone of its brand, off-road capability.|$|E
25|$|The <b>harshness</b> of his {{criticism}} {{and the strength}} of his reputation, however, continued to discourage naturalists from speculating about the gradual transmutation of species, until Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species more than two decades after Cuvier's death.|$|E
25|$|A {{suite of}} sound-deadening {{measures}} to dramatically reduce noise, vibration and <b>harshness.</b> For instance, engineers added pellets {{to a member}} of the chassis side rail. These pellets expand by 50 times original volume during the adhesive heating cycle to eliminate rattles.|$|E
25|$|A stalwart Republican {{with some}} isolationist tendencies, Pepper {{attacked}} the Versailles Peace Treaty for its <b>harshness,</b> and later President Wilson and the League of Nations, although his moralistic and legalistic mindset favored international order based on international law, {{and he continued}} to attend international legal association meetings.|$|E
25|$|All Shar-Pei puppies need early {{socialization}} with children, strangers, {{and other}} animals.

25|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{closeness}} between Ghaffar Khan and Ali, the <b>harshness</b> of their critique of Gandhi contrasted poorly with the patience shown by Gandhi in Ghaffar Khan's eyes. Another {{attempt was made}} by senior KK leaders to approach Sir Fazli Hussain a senior Punjabi leader of the Unionist party pleading for assistance against the crackdown which was dismissed.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch {{invasion}} however {{was followed}} closely by media coverage, and reports of the bloody conquest of {{the southern part of}} the island filtered to the West. The disproportion between the offense and <b>harshness</b> of the punitive actions was pointed out. The image of the Netherlands as a benevolent and responsible colonial power was seriously affected as a consequence.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{agree that}} films have largely shaped {{historical}} memories, but they debate issues of accuracy, plausibility, moralism, sensationalism, how facts are stretched {{in search of}} broader truths, and suitability for the classroom. Berlin argues that critics complain if the treatment emphasizes historical brutality, or if it glosses over the <b>harshness</b> to highlight the emotional impact of slavery.|$|E
25|$|The <b>harshness</b> of German law was {{demonstrated}} by such cases, as 5 months of penal camp {{for a woman}} who smiled to English POW's in Ostrów Wielkopolski. A 15-year-old girl who gave a cigarette to a POW was sentenced for 3 months imprisonment in concentration camp. In order to intimidate Polish population a law was passed that ordered obligatory participation in mass executions.|$|E
25|$|According to Maududi, Islam {{would strike}} a balance between the <b>harshness</b> of capitalism, and the {{restriction}} on property rights of socialism. It would embodying all of the virtues of the two inferior systems, and none of their shortcomings. At the same time, Islamic economics would not be some kind of mixed economy/social democratic compromise between capitalism and socialism, but a distinct and superior system.|$|E
25|$|Maror and Chazeret: Two {{types of}} bitter herbs, symbolizing the {{bitterness}} and <b>harshness</b> of the slavery which the Jews endured in Ancient Egypt. For maror, many people use freshly grated horseradish or whole horseradish root. Chazeret is typically romaine lettuce, whose roots are bitter-tasting. Either the horseradish or romaine lettuce may be eaten in {{fulfillment of the}} mitzvah of eating bitter herbs during the Seder.|$|E
25|$|The Toronado was GM's first {{subframe}} automobile, {{which means}} it was partly unitized, and used a subframe that ended at the forward end of the rear suspension leaf springs, serving as an attachment point for the springs. It carried the powertrain, front suspension and floorpan, allowing greater isolation of road and engine <b>harshness</b> (the design was conceptually similar to the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird that would debut for 1967).|$|E
25|$|In {{a changed}} and more {{personal}} manner, he drew Dead Christ pictures (In these days {{one of the}} master's most frequent themes e.g. Dead Christ Supported by the Madonna and St. John, or Pietà). with less <b>harshness</b> of contour, a broader treatment of forms and draperies and less force of religious feeling. Giovanni's early works have often been linked both compositionally and stylistically to those of his brother-in-law, Andrea Mantegna.|$|E
25|$|Some {{deportees}} made primitive rafts {{to try to}} escape, {{but most}} of the rafts collapsed and hundreds of corpses washed up on the shore below the island. Guards hunted and killed other escapees, as if they were hunting animals for sport. Because of the lack of any transportation {{to the rest of the}} country, except upstream to Tomsk, and the <b>harshness</b> of life in the taiga, any other escapees were ultimately presumed dead.|$|E
25|$|The 2000 film Billy Elliot, {{was based}} around mining {{communities}} in Easington Colliery and Seaham. Several scenes depict the chaos at picket lines, clashes between armies {{of police and}} striking miners, and the shame associated with crossing the picket line. It showed the abject poverty associated with the strike and the <b>harshness</b> and desperation of not having coal for heat in winter. The film {{was turned into a}} musical, Billy Elliot the Musical by Elton John.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{a popular}} king among his subjects, {{he was also}} known for his cruelty to his enemies. Some {{pictures}} depict him putting a dog chain through the jaw of a defeated Arab king and then making him live in a dog kennel. Many paintings of the period exhibit his brutality, however Assyrian <b>harshness</b> was reserved solely for those who took up arms against the Assyrian king, and neither Ashurbanipal nor his predecessors conducted genocides, massacres or ethnic cleansings against civilian populations.|$|E
