25|$|The J.M. Smucker Company, American {{manufacturer}} of Crisco (the original partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening), in 2004 released a new formulation made from solid saturated palm oil cut with soybean oil and sunflower oil. This blend yielded an equivalent shortening {{much like the}} previous partially hydrogenated Crisco, and was labelled zero grams of trans <b>fat</b> <b>per</b> 1 tablespoon serving (as compared with 1.5grams per tablespoon of original Crisco). As of 24 January 2007, Smucker claims that all Crisco shortening products in the US have been reformulated to contain less than one gram of trans <b>fat</b> <b>per</b> serving while keeping saturated fat content less than butter. The separately marketed trans fat free version introduced in 2004 was discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Before 2006, {{consumers}} in the United States could not directly determine the presence (or quantity) of trans fats in food products. This information could only be inferred from the ingredient list, notably from the partially hydrogenated ingredients. In 2010, according to the FDA, the average American consumed 5.8grams of trans <b>fat</b> <b>per</b> day (2.6% of energy intake). Monoglycerides and diglycerides are not considered fats by the FDA, despite their nearly equal calorie per weight contribution during actual ingestion.|$|E
25|$|Since December 2005, Health Canada has {{required}} that food labels list {{the amount of}} trans fat in the nutrition facts section for most foods. Products with less than 0.2nbsp&grams of trans <b>fat</b> <b>per</b> serving may be labeled as free of trans fats. These labelling allowances are not widely known, but as an awareness of them develops, controversy over truthful labelling is growing. In Canada, trans fat quantities on labels include naturally occurring trans fats from animal sources.|$|E

25|$|The pre-procedure mammograms were {{negative}} for malignant neoplasms. The types of anaesthesia applied were general (two patients) and epidural analgesia plus sedation, with local infiltration and intercostal nerve blocks (15 patients). The autologous adipocyte tissue was grafted in one-to-three stages; the average volume of a tissue-graft was 278.6cm3 of <b>fat</b> <b>per</b> operation, per breast. Post-procedure, each patient {{was instructed to}} regard any lump in the breasts as unrelated to the fat grafts, until after a complete medical workup of the breast lump had been performed. Moreover, the study Cell-assisted Lipotransfer for Cosmetic Breast Augmentation: Supportive Use of Adipose-Derived Stem/Stromal Cells (2007), about a 40-woman cohort, indicated that the inclusion of adipose stem cells to the grafts of adipocyte fat increased the rate of corrective success of the autologous fat-grafting procedure.|$|E

2500|$|Mandatory food {{labeling}} for {{trans fats}} {{was introduced in}} several countries. Campaigns were launched by activists to bring attention to the issue and change the practices of food manufacturers. In January 2007, {{faced with the prospect}} of an outright ban on the sale of their product, Crisco was reformulated to meet the United States Food and Drug Administration definition of [...] "zero grams trans <b>fats</b> <b>per</b> serving" [...] (that is less than one gram per tablespoon, or up to 7% by weight; or less than 0.5 grams per serving size) by boosting the saturation and then diluting the resulting solid fat with unsaturated vegetable oils.|$|R

40|$|The role of {{amount and}} type of dietary fat {{consumption}} in the aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood, despite suggestive biological plausibility. The associations of total fat, fat subtypes and fat sources with HCC incidence were investigated in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, which includes 191 incident HCC cases diagnosed between 1992 and 2010. Diet was assessed by country-specific, validated dietary questionnaires. A single 24 -h diet recall from a cohort subsample was used for measurement error calibration. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI) were estimated from Cox proportional hazard models. Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV/HCV) status and biomarkers of liver function were assessed separately in a nested case-control subset with available blood samples (HCC= 122). In multivariable calibrated models, there was a statistically significant inverse association between total fat intake and risk of HCC (per 10 g/d, HR= 0. 80, 95 %CI: 0. 65 - 0. 99), which was mainly driven by monounsaturated <b>fats</b> (<b>per</b> 5 g/d, HR= 0. 71, 95 %CI: 0. 55 - 0. 92) rather than polyunsaturated <b>fats</b> (<b>per</b> 5 g/d, HR= 0. 92, 95 %CI: 0. 68 - 1. 25). There was no association between saturated fats (HR= 1. 08, 95 %CI: 0. 88 - 1. 34) and HCC risk. The ratio of polyunsaturated/monounsaturated fats to saturated fats was not significantly associated with HCC risk (per 0. 2 point, HR= 0. 86, 95 %CI: 0. 73 - 1. 01). Restriction of analyses to HBV/HCV free participants or adjustment for liver function did not substantially alter the findings. In this large prospective European cohort, higher consumption of monounsaturated fats is associated with lower HCC risk. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|After the {{selection}} criteria, an initial private interview about training patterns was {{performed with the}} selected athletes (sedentary subjects were not assessed at this moment), {{as part of the}} EROS study (for all arms). The interview included questions regarding training intensity (self-evaluation and evaluation by a professional coach, on a scale from 0 to 10 compared to athletes of the same level of training) and time since starting training. Other questions asked in the interview included whether they worked or studied besides training, and if they did, how many hours they worked or studied per day (on average); self-referred libido (on a scale from 0 to 10 compared to libido 1  year prior to the questionnaire); details of food ingestion each day in the 7  days prior to the questionnaire (including number of calories per kilogram per day, grams of carbohydrates, proteins and <b>fats</b> <b>per</b> kilogram per day); and sleeping patterns (average duration of sleep, self-referred sleep quality on a scale from 0 to 10, and presence or absence of initial insomnia and terminal insomnia).
