25|$|Ori and Sein {{come across}} two beings in their quest: Gumo, the last {{survivor}} of the spider-like Gumon clan and whose home supports the Wind element; and Kuro, a giant owl who is hostile toward Ori. Her hostility and the forest's cataclysm are explained in flashbacks. When Ori was lost, the Spirit Tree released {{a flash of light}} to look for them, which killed all of Kuro's recently hatched offspring. To prevent this from happening to her yet unborn child, Kuro took away the core on top of the Spirit Tree, which is actually Sein. Without the Spirit Tree's support, the three elements cannot be sustained, and Nibel lost its balance. As the element of Wind is rekindled, Gumo, realizing what Ori and Sein <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> uses his clan treasure that stores the light from the Spirit Tree to revive Naru, and takes her to where Ori is.|$|E

Enter where entry is banned and face the consequences, Take blows without giving them. If a fence is raised in your path , don't turn back, jump over it. Don't stop with walking through the road, enter the temple, every temple, every day, everybody. If the offering of pudding is ready, take it. Go to the place where free food is served in the temple; and sit along with others. Let the Government be informed of what you <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> One should not fight shy of laying down one's life. Those who think another's touch pollutes him should not be left unmolested in their so called cleanliness. That is my viewâ€¦. Give publicity to all these in the papers. Let people know that I subscribe to their views. But let there be no violence or show of force. Don't be perturbed by coercion.|$|E

A {{physician}} testified that both of Berkman's weapons, the gun and the dagger, could have caused death. Leishman testified that Berkman fired his pistol at him once and Berkman asked, [...] "Well, did I intend to kill you?" [...] "I think so", Leishman replied, to which Berkman said, [...] "Well that's not true. I didn't <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] Several witnesses {{told the jury}} that Berkman had visited the Carnegie offices three times. Berkman's dagger and gun were placed into evidence, and the prosecution rested.|$|E

[...] He noted that Brown had an income of approximately $23,000 in 2010, had paid nothing to assist with pre-birth expenses, and had indicated that he did not <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. [...] In addition, Kittredge stated that the record reflected that Maldonado informed both the adoption agency and the adoption attorney of the child's Cherokee heritage, but the notification to the tribe did not have the correct identifying information for the father. [...] At the child's birth, the Capobiancos were present, and Matt Capobianco cut the umbilical cord.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "Draft Clark" [...] {{campaign}} {{began to}} grow with the launch of DraftWesleyClark.com on April 10, 2003. The organization signed up {{tens of thousands of}} volunteers, made 150 media appearances discussing Clark, and raised $1.5 million in pledges for his campaign. A different website, DraftClark2004.com, was the first organization to register as a political action committee in June 2003 to persuade Clark to run. They had presented him with 1000 emails in May 2003 from throughout the country asking him to run. One of DraftClark2004's founders, Brent Blackaby, said of the draft effort: [...] "Just fifty-two years ago citizens {{from all over the country}} were successful in their efforts to draft General Eisenhower. We <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same in 2004 by drafting General Clark. If he runs, he wins." ...|$|E

500|$|Thompson {{first hit}} the trails in Iowa. His {{strategy}} in the state was {{to spend more time}} there than any other candidate, emphasizing that he [...] "intend to win Iowa" [...] because of his midwest roots. He commented on fiscal responsibility at an event in a Des Moines suburb stating that [...] "Republicans went to Washington and we lost our way" [...] because [...] "we tried to spend [...] like Democrats." [...] He introduced a health care platform that emphasized prevention and called for reforms in the current system to ensure that all Americans be covered in the future. In the financial sphere of the campaign, Thompson acknowledged that he could not compete with funds being raised by the upper-tiered candidates, but he stated that he did not <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so because his campaign was [...] "different" [...] than the others; according to Thompson, his was more centered around a strong ground organization in Iowa.|$|E
500|$|... "The Hounds of Baskerville" [...] took {{around four}} weeks to film, with {{shooting}} mostly taking place throughout May 2011. Additional scenes were shot later in July and August. Filming on location mostly took place across South Wales, with {{parts of the}} episode being shot on location in Dartmoor, even though the producers did not originally <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The first day took place at a cemetery. The producers {{were looking for a}} village in South Wales that was [...] "very English-looking." [...] Scenes of the fictional [...] "Cross Keys" [...] pub were filmed at the Bush Inn in St Hilary, Vale of Glamorgan. The production team donated Â£500 to the village after filming had finished. In one scene, after Sherlock first witnesses the hound, Sherlock makes deductions about a mother and son from a nearby table. In filming the scene, Cumberbatch has to recall multiple pages of monologue in front of camera, and had to talk faster than he was used to.|$|E
500|$|Before the Thraliana, Thrale kept {{two sets}} of anecdotes: the first was devoted to Samuel Johnson {{and the other for}} {{miscellaneous}} events. She relied on these, along with her memory, to write the early portions of her work. Boswell, when trying to find information for his own work, wrote: [...] "Mr. Thrale told me, I am not sure what day, that there is a Book of Johnsoniana kept int heir Family, in which all Mr. Johnson's sayings and all that they can collect about him is put down ... I must try to get this Thralian Miscellany, to assist me in writing Mr. Johnson's Life, if Mrs. Thrale does not <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it herself." [...] After Johnson's death, Thrale used the Thraliana to create the Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson (1786). The manuscript passed through many hands and was owned by A. Edward Newton until his death in autumn 1940. The Thraliana was eventually published in 1942, and it was produced by the Clarendon Press in England while its editor, Katharine Balderston, was prohibited from travelling across the ocean from Wellesley College because of World War II.|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera in October 2010, de la Rocha allegedly confirmed that a new album was in the works, with a possibility of a 2011 release. De la Rocha is reported as saying, [...] "We are all bigger and more mature and we do not fall into the problems we faced 10 or 15 years ago. This is different and we project a lot: we are working on a new album due out next year, perhaps summer for the northern hemisphere". However, in early May 2011, guitarist Tom Morello said that the band were not working on a new album, but would not rule out the possibility of future studio work. [...] "The band is not writing songs, the band is not in the studio", Morello told The Pulse of Radio. [...] "We get along famously and we all, you know, <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more Rage Against the Machine stuff in the future, but beyond sort of working out a concert this year, there's nothing else on the schedule (for 2011)". The band created its own festival, the L.A. Rising. As Morello stated, the only Rage Against the Machine appearance for 2011 was a performance on July 30 at the L.A. Rising festival with El Gran Silencio, Immortal Technique, Lauryn Hill, Rise Against and Muse. As of mid-2012, there are no plans for any more shows. During {{an interview}} on July 30, 2011, Commerford seemingly contradicted Morello's comments, stating that new material was being written, and specific plans {{for the next two years}} were in place.|$|E
500|$|In 1985 Randall H. Langer, a young {{real estate}} {{developer}} active in apartment rehabilitation in the neighborhood, aided {{the creation of a}} local historic district, the Sheridan Park Historic District, which critics charged was of dubious historical value and created to facilitate gentrification. Nineteen tax delinquent properties in Uptown were offered for sale by auction by Cook County in Fall, 1987. Since 1983 Cook County had a program to afford local governments the opportunity to acquire tax delinquent properties for almost nothing, prior to the county's scavenger sale to the public, if the local government had a specific development plan. On October 28, 1987, Shiller urged the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee of the Cook County Board to accept a no-cash bid from the City for the 19 tax-delinquent parcels in Uptown. A decision was deferred when Commissioner Rosemarie Love requested a delay on grounds that the Washington administration had not provided a development plan. Subcommittee chairman Commissioner Richard Siebel said the County's no-cash sales program was [...] "designed to place property back on the tax rolls as quickly as possible â€“ not for land-banking. It's not appropriate for us to pass this until the city tells us, parcel by parcel, what they <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and how they plan to pay for it." [...] Another commissioner noted that the City already owned 7,000 tax-delinquent properties, and another added, [...] "Properties we gave to the city 12 years ago are still war zones. I don't want the same thing to happen here." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the appeal was prepared, Seck had left Legal Services but was still the {{attorney}} of record. [...] The tribe paid to fly him to Washington, D.C. to prepare the brief with Dan Israel of NARF and Bernie Becker, the tribe's attorney who would argue the case before the Supreme Court. At oral arguments on April 20, 1976, Becker pointed out that Public Law 280 gave the state jurisdiction over criminal matters and civil [...] "causes of actions" [...] â€“ a legal term for lawsuits. Since Congress had also passed other Indian laws at the same time, such as the various Indian Termination Acts, which specifically authorized states to collect taxes from Indians, its silence in this area meant Congress did not <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so with Public Law 280. Becker brought up the leading article on Public Law 280, by UCLA law professor Carole Goldberg, that argued that the law was established {{to address the problem}} of crime on reservations. He also noted that tribes which had adequate law-and-order processes, such as the Red Lake Band of Chippewa, were excluded from state jurisdiction in Minnesota. Arguing for the State of Minnesota was C. H. Luther of the State Attorney General's office. Luther argued four points for the tax being valid: a) the language of the statute; b) the legislative history of Public Law 280; c) prior judicial opinions; and d) public policy. Luther conceded that if the trailer was a fixed house or real property, it would be exempt from taxation. Luther also stated that other taxes [...] such as gasoline, sales, income and other taxes of general applicability [...] would apply to Indians.|$|E
