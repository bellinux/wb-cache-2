50|$|Amounts {{of water}} {{significant}} {{enough to cause}} <b>hydrolock</b> tend to upset the air/fuel mixture in gasoline engines. If water is introduced slowly enough, this effect can cut power and speed in an engine {{to a point that}} when <b>hydrolock</b> actually occurs it does not cause catastrophic engine damage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydrolock</b> {{is common}} on radial and {{inverted}} engines (cylinders pointing downwards) when the engine sits {{for a long}} period. Engine oil seeps down under gravity into the cylinder through various means (through the rings, valve guides, etc.) and can fill a cylinder with enough oil to <b>hydrolock</b> it. The seepage effect can {{be observed by the}} blue-white smoke commonly seen when a radial engine starts up. In order to prevent engine damage, it is universal practice for the ground crew or pilot to check for <b>hydrolock</b> during pre-flight inspection of the aircraft, typically by hand-cranking the propeller for several turns to make sure the crankshaft cycles normally through all cylinders.|$|E
50|$|Diesel {{engines are}} more {{susceptible}} to <b>hydrolock</b> than gasoline engines. Due to their higher compression ratios, diesel engines have a much smaller final combustion chamber volume, requiring much less liquid to <b>hydrolock.</b> Diesel engines also tend to have higher torque, rotating inertia, and stronger starter motors than gasoline engines. The result is that a diesel engine is more likely to suffer catastrophic damage.|$|E
5000|$|If {{an engine}} <b>hydrolocks</b> while at speed, a {{mechanical}} failure is likely. Common damage modes include bent or broken connecting rods, a fractured crank, a fractured head, a fractured block, crankcase damage, damaged bearings, or {{any combination of}} these. Forces absorbed by other interconnected components may cause additional damage. Physical damage to metal parts can manifest as a [...] "crashing" [...] or [...] "screeching" [...] sound and usually requires replacement of the engine or a substantial rebuild of its major components.|$|R
50|$|If an {{internal}} combustion engine <b>hydrolocks</b> while idling or under low power conditions, the engine may stop suddenly with no immediate damage. In this case the engine can often be purged by unscrewing the spark plugs or injectors and spinning the engine to expel the liquid from the combustion chambers and then restarted. Depending on how the liquid {{was introduced to the}} engine, it possibly can be restarted and dried out with normal combustion heat, or it may require more work, such as flushing out corrupted operating fluids and replacing damaged gaskets.|$|R
50|$|Liquids {{inside an}} {{internal}} combustion engine are extremely detrimental because of the incompressibility of liquids. Although not the most common cause, a severely flooded engine {{could result in a}} <b>hydrolock.</b> A <b>hydrolock</b> occurs when a liquid fills a combustion chamber {{to the point that it}} is impossible to turn the crankshaft without a catastrophic failure of the engine or one of its vital components.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydrolock</b> (a {{shorthand}} notation for hydrostatic lock) is {{an abnormal}} condition of any device {{which is designed}} to compress a gas by mechanically restraining it; most commonly the reciprocating internal combustion engine, the case this article refers to unless otherwise noted. <b>Hydrolock</b> occurs when a volume of liquid greater than the volume of the cylinder at its minimum (end of the piston's stroke) enters the cylinder. Since liquids are nearly incompressible the piston cannot complete its travel; either the engine must stop rotating or a mechanical failure must occur.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydrolock</b> most {{commonly}} occurs in automobiles when driving through floods, either {{where the water}} is above {{the level of the}} air intake or the vehicle's speed is excessive, creating a tall bow wave. A vehicle fitted with a cold air intake mounted low on the vehicle will be especially vulnerable to hydrolocking when being driven through standing water or heavy precipitation. Engine coolant entering the cylinders through various means (such as a blown head gasket) is another common cause. Excessive fuel entering (flooding) one or more cylinders in liquid form due to abnormal operating conditions can also cause <b>hydrolock.</b>|$|E
50|$|GM {{recalled}} 1.5 million {{vehicles with}} this engine on April 14, 2009 due to risk of fire from engine oil leaking under the valve cover gaskets onto hot exhaust manifolds. The fire could {{spread to the}} nearby plastic spark plug wire retainers on the valve cover {{and then to the}} rest of the engine compartment. GM fitted the affected vehicles with redesigned spark plug wire retainers. These engines were noted for having problems with the plastic upper intake manifold cracking around the EGR passage. The engine would then <b>hydrolock.</b> The lower intake gaskets and upper intake manifolds were revised, correcting all these issues.|$|E
50|$|Damage {{can occur}} {{to the engine}} if too much water is {{injected}} or if the injector itself malfunctions. Water is not compressible, and much water in the cylinder prior to, or during, the compression cycle can cause a condition called <b>hydrolock,</b> where the volume of liquid in the engine is close {{to or greater than}} the volume between piston and head (or between pistons in a opposed piston engine) of the engine at top dead center, resulting in extremely high cylinder pressure that may cause blown heads, shattering of the piston, connecting rods or other damage to the engine. This damage is normally fatal to the engine and typically requires a full rebuild or engine replacement.|$|E
50|$|Small boats with {{outboard}} engines and PWCs tend to ingest water {{simply because they}} run in and around it. During a rollover, or when a wave washes over the craft, its engine can <b>hydrolock,</b> though severe damage is rare due to the special air intakes and low rotating inertia of small marine engines. Inboard marine engines have a different vulnerability as these often have their cooling water mixed with the exhaust gases in the header to quiet the engine. Rusted out exhaust headers or lengthy periods of turning the starter can cause water to build up in the exhaust line to the point it back-flows through the exhaust manifold and fills the cylinders.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} lock {{can occur in}} steam engines due to steam condensing back into water. In most steam engine designs {{there must be a}} small moment {{at the end of the}} return stroke of the piston when all the valves are shut and it is compressing any remaining steam. Water can be introduced from the boiler or in a cold engine, steam will condense to water on the cool walls of the cylinders and can potentially <b>hydrolock</b> an engine. This is just as damaging as it is to internal combustion engines and in the case of a steam locomotive can be very dangerous as a broken connecting rod could puncture the firebox/boiler and cause a steam explosion. Steam engines (with the exception of small model and toy machines) are always fitted with cylinder drain cocks which are opened to allow excess water and steam to escape during warm up.|$|E
50|$|If {{the gasket}} fails, {{a variety of}} {{problems}} can occur, from compression loss (leading to power reduction, or a rough engine), to exhaust gases being forced into the cooling system, leading to the engine overheating and increased engine wear due to the motor oil being mixed with antifreeze. Coolant can leak into the cylinders, causing the exhaust to issue steam and the catalytic converter to be damaged. If a very large amount of coolant does this, <b>hydrolock</b> can occur, causing extensive engine damage. Sometimes, all that may happen when a head gasket is blown is excessive steam erupting from the tailpipe; yet the engine may act and drive like normal, until all the coolant is gone and the engine overheats. In other occurrences compression leaks into small spaces between the gasket, and either the cylinder head or engine block traps air that is then released when the engine is turned off. The air then escapes into the coolant and creates air pockets. Sometimes these air pockets can get trapped in the engine's coolant thermostat, causing it to stay closed and cause further overheating, thereby creating still more voids between the gasket and the engine. Air pockets can also cause the engine to expel coolant into the overflow or expansion tank, thereby {{reducing the amount of}} coolant the engine has available to stay cool.|$|E
