25|$|The {{purpose of}} radio {{resource}} management is {{to satisfy the}} data rates that are requested by the users of a cellular network. The main resources are time intervals, frequency blocks, and transmit powers. Each user has its own objective function that, for example, can represent some combination of the data rate, latency, and energy efficiency. These objectives are conflicting since the frequency resources are very scarce, thus {{there is a need}} for tight spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> which causes immense inter-user interference if not properly controlled. Multi-user MIMO techniques are nowadays used to reduce the interference by adaptive precoding. The network operator would like to both bring great coverage and high data rates, thus the operator would like to find a Pareto optimal solution that balance the total network data throughput and the user fairness in an appropriate subjective manner.|$|E
2500|$|Numerical example: Analog FM {{requires}} 0.2MHz per programme. The <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> {{factor in}} most countries is approximately 15, meaning that {{only one out of}} 15 transmitter sites can use the same channel frequency without problems with co-channel interference, i.e. cross-talk. [...] Assuming a total availability of 102 FM channels at a bandwidth of 0.2MHz over the Band II spectrum of 87.5 to 108.0 MHz, an average of 102/15 = 6.8 radio channels are possible on each transmitter site (plus lower-power local transmitters causing less interference). This results in a system spectral efficiency of 1 / 15 / (0.2 MHz) = 0.30 programmes/transmitter/MHz. DAB with 192 kbit/s codec requires 1.536MHz * 192 kbit/s / 1,136 kbit/s = 0.26MHz per audio programme. The <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> factor for local programmes and multi-frequency broadcasting networks (MFN) is typically 4 or 5, resulting in 1 / 4 / (0.26MHz) = 0.96 programmes/transmitter/MHz. [...] This is 3.2 times as efficient as analog FM for local stations. For single frequency network (SFN) transmission, for example of national programmes, the channel re-use factor is 1, resulting in 1/1/0.25MHz = 3.85 programmes/transmitter/MHz, which is 12.7 times as efficient as FM for national and regional networks.|$|E
2500|$|Methods were {{developed}} to improve the performance of cellular radio networks and enable more aggressive <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> in the early 1990s. Space-division multiple access (SDMA) uses directional or smart antennas to communicate on the same frequency with users in different locations within range of the same base station. An SDMA system was proposed by Richard Roy and Björn Ottersten, researchers at ArrayComm, in 1991. Their US patent (No. 5515378 issued in 1996) describes a method for increasing capacity using [...] "an array of receiving antennas at the base station" [...] with a [...] "plurality of remote users." ...|$|E
30|$|Overall, the <b>frequency</b> of tag <b>reuse</b> in the OSR Repository is not uniform. More specifically, {{there are}} few tags that have been reused many times and many tags that have been reused few times. The same also applies for users, namely {{there are few}} users that have re-used many times and many users that have reused few tags. Both {{distributions}} of tags per their <b>frequency</b> of <b>reuse</b> occurrence and the users per their <b>frequency</b> of tags <b>reused</b> resemble a power law. This behavior is fully aligned with the behavior of other social tagging systems applied in repositories beyond LORs.|$|R

To obtain {{wideband}} {{radar cross-section}} (RCS) frequency response of multiple perfectly electric conducting (PEC) objects, the <b>frequency</b> sweeping by <b>reusing</b> the ultra-wide band characteristic basis functions (UCBFs) is applied. This method, {{based on the}} Characteristic Basis Function Method (CBFM), maintains all the benefit of CBFM, especially accelerating the solution of matrix equations generated by the method of moments (MoM) applied to the scatting problems in electromagnetics. Compared with conventional CBFM procedure, reusing the UCBFs without repeating the calculations of them at different frequency points leads to a significant reduction of computational time.

2500|$|Non-broadcast {{signals are}} also affected.

40|$|Abstract — In a <b>frequency</b> <b>reusing</b> {{wireless}} {{local area}} network (WLAN), the co-channel interference (CCI) environment will change when new access points (APs) join the network. Therefore, the user throughput reduces if the available channels are not properly re-allocated. A newly joined AP is designed to measure the CCI levels on the available channels to select the best channel which experiences the lowest CCI (this {{is referred to as the}} conventional channel assignment). However, old APs’ channels are not anymore the best since the CCI environment has changed after the new one joined. If each AP periodically measures the CCI environment and reselects the channel experiencing the lowest CCI, the throughput may improve. This is called the dynamic channel assignment (DCA). In this paper, we apply the channel segregation based DCA (CS-DCA) to WLAN. In order to examine the channel distribution pattern obtained by CS-DCA, we introduce three indicators: the autocorrelation of channel distribution pattern indicating the degree of stability, the deviation of channel reusing, and the minimum co-channel AP distance. We confirm by computer simulation that the CS-DCA can autonomously form a channel distribution pattern which minimizes the CCI at each AP and that the CS-DCA improves the signalto-interference-ratio (SIR) compared to the conventional scheme...|$|R
