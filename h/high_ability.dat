5|$|The {{watershed}} {{is split}} into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western {{two thirds of the}} watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's <b>high</b> <b>ability</b> to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the teachers’ {{perception}} on socioemotional competence of their adolescent students, according to exceptionality (<b>high</b> <b>abilities</b> versus non <b>high</b> <b>abilities)</b> and gender. The sample was composed of 443 teachers from 55 Secondary Schools in Murcia (Spain). The instrument used was the EQ-i: YV-O for teachers (BAR-ON & PARKER, in press). According to the exceptionality of the students (<b>high</b> <b>abilities</b> versus non <b>high</b> <b>abilities)</b> the results showed that teachers perceived students with <b>high</b> <b>abilities</b> as being more adaptable, having greater general mood and having greater interpersonal abilities. Moreover, in relation to gender, teachers scored boys as having better stress management. In addition, with regard to exceptionality (<b>high</b> <b>abilities</b> versus non <b>high</b> <b>abilities)</b> and gender, the results showed statistically significant differences in the adaptability, general mood, and intrapersonal dimensions...|$|R

Male correlations ranged from -0.03 to 0.54. However, an interesting finding was that in the three <b>high</b> <b>ability</b> samples, there was a significant gender difference in SAT-Math scores alone. This difference favored males. In the three <b>high</b> <b>ability</b> samples, males scored higher than females in mental rotation ability.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the assignment of workers to layers and firms. In particular, I use an administrative dataset of French workers to study the organization of firms. First, I test whether <b>higher</b> <b>ability</b> workers are employed in the higher layers of firms. Second, I test whether there is positive assortative matching between workers in the different layers of firms. Third, I test whether <b>higher</b> <b>ability</b> workers allow their managers to increase their span of control and employ larger teams. To do this, I first classify employees as residing in different organizational layers such as production and administrative workers, supervisors, senior managers, and owners and CEOs, using occupational codes. From a panel wage regression I then obtain estimates of workers’ ability as in Abowd et al. (1999). I then study how workers sort into layers and across layers with other workers. I emphasize three results. First, <b>higher</b> <b>ability</b> workers are employed in the higher layers of firms. Second, I find evidence of positive assortative matching between workers in the different layers of firms. Third, I find different mechanisms are behind the sorting pattern observed in the data. I find evidence that <b>higher</b> <b>ability</b> workers limit their managers’ span of control, and I also find weak evidence that <b>higher</b> <b>ability</b> workers allow their managers to increase their span of control and employ larger teams. positive assortative matching, firm organization, matched employer-employee data, high-dimensional fixed effect...|$|R

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that {{individual differences in}} mental ability depend, in part, on the speed or efficiency of performing elementary cognitive tasks was examined. Performance and event-related potential measures were determined during {{the performance of a}} Sternberg memory scanning task with three levels of difficulty, a category matching task, and a synonym-antonym task. In each task two stimuli were presented sequentially on each trial. In the Sternberg task, the first stimulus was one, three, or five letters and is called the memory set. The second stimulus was a probe stimulus. A category name and a category exemplar were presented in each trial of the category matching task. The two stimulus words presented in each trial of the synonym-antonym task were either synonyms or antonyms. Reaction time, movement time, and reaction time standard deviation were all negatively correlated with intelligence at levels consistent with previous research. In the Sternberg task, P 300 amplitude to the first stimulus increased as the number of items in the memory set increased, affirming that P 300 amplitude is sensitive to demands for processing resources. P 300 amplitude to the first stimulus was smaller for <b>higher</b> <b>ability</b> than lower ability subjects. This is consistent with the idea that lower ability subjects require greater processing resources than <b>higher</b> <b>ability</b> subjects. The ERP differences between <b>higher</b> and lower <b>ability</b> subjects to the first stimulus were greater at fronto-central electrode sites than at Pz where P 300 is maximal. P 300 amplitude to the target stimulus decreased as set size increased. This is consistent with the view that P 300 amplitude is sensitive to changes in task difficulty. P 300 amplitude to the second stimulus tended to be larger for the <b>higher</b> <b>ability</b> group, an effect that can be understood in terms of equivocation. P 300 latency to both the first and second stimulus increased as the set size increased, affirming that P 300 latency {{is a measure of the}} time required for stimulus evaluation and classification. <b>Higher</b> <b>ability</b> subjects displayed longer P 300 latency to the first stimulus than lower ability subjects. The longer P 300 latency to the first stimulus suggests that <b>higher</b> <b>ability</b> subjects devote more time to stimulus analysis and planning than lower ability subjects. The performance of <b>higher</b> <b>ability</b> subjects on these tasks was characterised by the more efficient deployment of processing resources and less equivocation than lower ability subjects. Speed of processing and speed of motor response were faster for <b>higher</b> <b>ability</b> than lower ability subjects...|$|R

This transformation introduces to the game the notion of nature's choice or God's choice. Consider a game consisting of an employer considering whether to hire a job applicant. The job applicant's ability might be one of two things: high or low. His ability level is random; he is low ability with probability 1/3 and <b>high</b> <b>ability</b> with probability 2/3.

About Montgomery's conduct of the Normandy campaign, Badsey wrote: [...] "Too much discussion on Normandy has centered on the controversial decisions of the Allied commanders. It was not good enough, apparently, to win such a complete and spectacular victory over an enemy that had conquered most of Europe unless it was done perfectly. Most of the blame for this lies with Montgomery, who was foolish enough to insist that it had been done perfectly, that Normandy – and all his other battles – had been fought accordingly to a precise master plan drawn up beforehand, from which he never deviated. It says much for his personality that Montgomery found others to agree with him, despite overwhelmingly evidence to the contrary. His handling of the Battle of Normandy was of a very high order, and as the person who would certainly have been blamed for losing the battle, he deserves the credit for winning it".|$|E
