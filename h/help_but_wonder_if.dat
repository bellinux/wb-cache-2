2500|$|The {{strike and}} ensuing fire sale left fans in Montreal livid. The Expos {{finished}} {{last in the}} NL East in , and average game attendance fell by nearly 26%, from 24,543 to 18,189. [...] Interest in the Expos continued to decline {{in the years that}} followed; they would never draw more than 20,000 fans per game again during their tenure in Montreal. While noting the Atlanta Braves went on to win 11 consecutive NL East titles following the strike, Jonah Keri expressed the viewpoint of the fans as it related to Brochu and the team's owners: [...] "Expos fans couldn't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> that could have been them celebrating every year ... had Brochu convinced the team's cheapskate owners to spend a few damn dollars, or taken a leap of faith that short-term financial pain would lead to long-term success." [...] The media, meanwhile, had taken to calling the Expos a [...] "Triple-A team" [...] as the team seemed to enter a period where they would develop players only to move them on to other organizations.|$|E

40|$|The EU and ASEAN {{are often}} {{compared}} and seen as relatively successful regional organisations {{in their respective}} regions. Yet of late, both regional organisations are under intense scrutiny as they confront challenges posed by the financial crisis and rising geopolitical tensions. Their inability to respond effectively to these challenges has brought about a chorus of criticisms. Noting the current tensions face by both the EU and ASEAN in their respective regions, one could not <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> how and <b>if</b> {{they would be able}} to deal with the increasing complex security landscape because of a weakened US, and the rise of the rest. This article will compare and contrast the approaches taken by the EU and ASEAN thus far in trying to build peace and prosperity, and how they manage the demands of power politics to distill some lessons on what they can learn from each other in order to navigate an increasingly paradoxical world of economic interdependence but political fragmentation...|$|R

5000|$|IGN {{gave the}} PlayStation 4 and Xbox One {{versions}} a 7 out of 10, stating [...] "WWE 2K15 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One doesn't quite meet the expectations set by previous {{entries in the}} series. While the wrestlers look amazing and the combat feels significantly better, MyCareer mode is an absolute slog and everything else has been done better in previous years. Between the narrower historical mode, the shuttered creation suites, and the dearth of combat options for bigger groups, WWE 2K15 has lost some of the tools that brought previous entries to the main event." [...] Eurogamer gave the game a 3 out of 10, stating [...] "WWE 2K15 is {{a kick in the}} teeth. Graphically assured as it is, almost every other element of the 15-year-old series has been cut back, tampered with pointlessly or outright ruined. The series hasn't been good for a long time now, but this year is the first it's been actively bad. The wait for a great new WWE game continues." [...] Joystiq gave the game 2.5 out of 5 stars, saying the game was [...] "a severe disappointment. The chain wrestling mechanic is tiresome, and online play is a chore. A dearth of customization options across the board tear away at what made the series special. WWE 2K15 is worth skipping this year, and I can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> 2K Sports itself might have been better served taking a year off from the ring." [...] Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 3/5, saying [...] "some players may pine for the older days of this franchise, where gameplay was frenetic and fast-measured. WWE 2K15 steps away from that methodology, and in turn delivers a much more deliberately-paced game, and one that is more intent on providing an authentic, one-to-one recreation of the drama that goes down in the squared circle." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} side, Brandon J. of Indie Vision Music stated plainly: [...] "This band does have talent deep within. What Stellar Kart {{needs to do}} to break the chains of {{repetition}} is to drop their producer, not because he isn't cutting it but because it’s {{time for a change}} of scenery. They need to take back all the writing credits for their songs and not rely on others to do the work for them. They need to stop doing tours of teen girl conventions, and youth night at the local Church. If they really want to expand their horizons, it’s time to test the waters and go out on their own. Maybe tour with other General market bands, or like minded Christian artists who have a similar style. I’m not 16 anymore and I seriously doubt any of these guys are near that age so it’s time to grow up a bit. I know that sounds harsh but the writing style on this album is aimed at Christian teens and it’s like it was purposely written that way. I can’t be the only guy feeling this way? Maybe I'm just burnt out on the Contemporary Christian Market because I've been a part of it in some small way for so many years." [...] Nathaniel Schexnayder of Jesus Freak Hideout concurred by saying: [...] "I've always thought that Stellar Kart has needed to make changes, both musically and lyrically, to make themselves a more stand-out band. However, while changes have been implemented with their latest release, I can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> the album has set them back. Undoubtedly, Stellar Kart fans will fall in love with Everything Is Different Now, but, as a whole, I couldn't wait to stop listening to Stellar Kart’s overproduced, underwhelming album. Maybe I'm just cynical. Or maybe this is just Stellar Kart’s fourth half-hearted album in five years which fails to show both musical and lyrical maturity." ...|$|E
