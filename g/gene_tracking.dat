40|$|The first {{genetic test}} was run in 1978 by Kan and Dozy and {{independently}} by Orkin et al. The molecular testing {{was performed to}} detect the mutation c. 20 A>T in the β-globin DNA responsible for sickle cell anaemia. Kan and Dozy applied restriction analysis of the β-globin gene followed by hybridisation with a molecular probe complementary to the fragment of human β-globin sequence (RFLP method) [1]. Results enabled them the discrimination between mutant homozygotes (affected persons), normal homozygotes (healthy persons) and heterozygotes (mutation carriers). To detect the same mutation, Orkin et al. applied hybridisation with two variant oligonucleotide molecular probes to distinguish between mutant and normal alleles of the β-globin gene [2]. A milestone in development of molecular diagnostic techniques for detection of human mutations was the invention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) made in 1983 by Kary Mullis. The PCR in molecular diagnostics is generally used to amplify DNA fragment before other molecular analyses are performed. Genetic testing is divided in two categories: direct testing and indirect testing (<b>gene</b> <b>tracking).</b> Direct genetic testing involves testing for a certain genotype, i. e. identification of a specific pathogenic mutation within a gene, {{that is responsible for}} a certain condition. Indirect genetic testing also known as <b>gene</b> <b>tracking</b> tests the inheritance and segregation of genetic markers linked to a specific condition within a family...|$|E

40|$|Carrier {{detection}} and prenatal diagnosis of hemophilia A have been perfor- med accurately by restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). However, a single intragenic DNA polymorphism with two (+ and -) alleles can be informative {{for no more}} than 50 % of women and this approach is time-consuming. The dinucleotide repeat sequence of varying length known as (dC-dA) n ･ (dG-dT) n, hereafter designated (CA) n, within intron 13 of the factor Ⅷ gene was analyzed in Japanese subjects by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The investigation of this variable number of tandern repeat (VNTR) in 110 X chromosomes from 70 healthy subjects (30 males and 40 females) revealed five different allelic fragments, i. e. 20 (59. 1 %), 21 (23. 7 %), 22 (3. 6 %), 23 (11. 8 %) and 25 (1. 8 %) repeats. Nineteen (47. 5 %) out of the 40 females analyzed were heterozygous for this VNTR. These findings suggest a strategy for providing a highly informative marker available for factor Ⅷ <b>gene</b> <b>tracking</b> studies in hemophilia A kindreds in a quicker and easier way...|$|E
40|$|Identification of {{a single}} base {{insertion}} in the COL 4 A 5 gene in Alport syndrome. We identified a novel mutation in the COL 4 A 5 gene of a Japanese patient with Alport syndrome. A combination of in vitro amplification of the exons with single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP) analysis suggested {{the presence of a}} mutation in exon 48. Sequencing of the amplified DNA revealed a single base (T) insertion which was between nucleotides T 4750 and G 4751 within the methionine 1516. This mutation caused a shift in the reading frame of nine amino acids and introduced a premature termination signal that would be expected to lack about two-thirds of the noncollagenous (NCI) domain. This mutation may interfere with type IV collagen assembly leading to increased permeability and play a causative role in the glomerular basement membrane abnormality of this patient with typical Alport syndrome. <b>Gene</b> <b>tracking</b> by restriction enzyme NlaIII digestion revealed that the patient's mother is heterozygous whereas the patient's brother and one sister are normal, albeit they have hematuria and proteinuria. Without gene analysis, they would have been misdiagnosed. We propose that the diagnosis of Alport syndrome should be {{made on the basis of}} both clinical phenotypes and molecular defects...|$|E

40|$|Mutations in the COL 4 A 5 gene in Alport syndrome: A {{possible}} {{mutation in}} primordial germ cells. Using {{a combination of}} gene amplification with single strand conformation polymorphisms analysis and sequencing, we examined the COL 4 A 5 gene in 37 patients with Alport syndrome. In patient A 8, a single base insertion was noted at codon 1, 597 tyrosine in exon 49. The premature terminal signal appeared and 89 amino acids (approximately one-third) of the non-collagenous domain were lost. The mutation was present in the mother, hence she is heterozygous. In patient A 12, the nucleotide changed from C to T at codon 1, 679 glutamine in exon 51, which created a termination codon, and 7 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus were lost. <b>Gene</b> <b>tracking</b> using peripheral leukocytes revealed that the parents did not carry the mutant allele, while the sister was heterozygous. DNA samples from hair roots and skin fibroblasts of the mother were normal and immunological examination of the epidermis of the mother indicated that the α 5 (IV) chain was normally expressed.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of haemophilia A and {{the identification of}} carriers has greatly improved {{with knowledge of the}} structure of the gene for factor VIII. This has permitted the defect to be tracked in families by the study of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), irrespective of the nature of the molecular defect. However, this approach is time-consuming and the information yielded falls away as more polymorphisms are added. Within the factor VIII gene lies another source of polymorphism, a dinucleotide repeat sequence of varying length known as (CA) n. Conventional mapping localised this (CA) n repeat to intron 13. The polymerase chain reaction, used to examine (CA) n variability in genomic DNA from 25 males and 67 females, revealed eight allelic bands between n = 16 and n = 24. 91 % of females were heterozygous for this repeat, and family studies showed X-linked mendelian inheritance with allelic frequencies ranging from 1 % to 45 %. The intron 13 (CA) n repeat is tightly linked with established RFLPs and tracks with haemophilia A in family studies. The analysis requires DNA from other family members, and relatives of sporadic cases of haemophilia A are only amenable to exclusion. Nonetheless, this intron 13 (CA) n repeat provides the most highly informative marker so far available for factor VIII <b>gene</b> <b>tracking</b> studies in haemophilia A kindreds and a result can be available within a day...|$|E

Of 50 known {{genes in the}} region, 11 candidates, including RPE 65 and PDE 4 B, were sequenced using di-deoxy capillary electrophoresis. Simultaneously, a subset of family members was analyzed using Agilent SureSelect All Exome capture followed by sequencing on an Illumina GAIIx platform. Candidate gene and exome sequencing resulted {{in the identification of}} an Asp 477 Gly mutation in exon 13 of the RPE 65 <b>gene</b> <b>tracking</b> with the disease in TCD-G. All coding exons of genes not sequenced to sufficient depth by next generation sequencing were sequenced by di-deoxy sequencing. No other potential disease-causing variants were found to segregate with disease in TCD-G. The Asp 477 Gly mutation was not present in Irish controls, but was in a second Irish family provisionally diagnosed with Choroideremia, bringing the combined two-point lod score to 5. 3. Mutations in RPE 65 are a known cause of recessive Leber Congenital Amaurosis and recessive RP, but no dominant mutations have been reported. Protein modeling suggests the Asp 477 Gly mutation may destabilize protein folding and mutant RPE 65 protein migrates marginally faster on SDS-PAGE compared to wild-type. Gene therapy for LCA patients with RPE 65 mutations has shown great promise, raising the possibility of related therapies for dominant-acting mutations in this gene...|$|E

40|$|Background: Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is a multiorgan {{autosomal recessive}} disorder. As CF is highly heterogeneous in Iran and many mutations {{have a low}} frequency, routine molecular diagnostic methods are not very efficient. The use of highly polymorphic intragenic markers not only can facilitate phenotype prediction in prenatal diagnosis by <b>gene</b> <b>tracking,</b> but also {{can lead to the}} demonstration of possible associations between haplotypes and specific mutations. We determined IVS 8 polyT and M 470 V polymorphisms in exon 10 of CFTR gene in this case-control study. Methods: Polymorphisms of IVS 8 polyT in 53 patients with CF were referred to Amirkola children's Hospital of Babol University of Medical Sciences, 2007 to 2011 and 49 fertile healthy individuals were determined by reverse dot blot method. M 470 V polymorphism was analyzed by PCR-RFLP. Results: In IVS 8 polyT study, T 7 was the most frequent allele in healthy individuals than patients with CF (respectively, 82. 8 % Vs. 77. 2 %). T 9 was more abundant in patients with CF than normal individuals (respectively, 21. 7 % Vs. 7. 4 %, P= 0. 005). T 9 /T 9 genotype was more frequent in patients than healthy individuals (respectively, 15. 1 % and 2 %, P= 0. 032). Study for M 470 V polymorphism showed that M/V was the most common genotype in normal individuals and patients with CF (respectively, 49 % and 40. 4 %). M-T 9 haplotype was highly associated with the disease in both patients with CF and normal individuals (respectively, 19. 1 % and 2. 4 %, (P< 0. 001 Conclusion: The allelic distribution and heterozygosity results suggest that both M 470 V and IVS 8 polyT can be helpful in the prenatal diagnosis of CF in Northern Iranians with a positive family history of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Background: About 15 % {{of couples}} have {{fertility}} problems and male factor in fertility accounts {{for half of}} the cases. In vitro generation of germ cells introduces a novel approach to male infertility and provides an effective system in <b>gene</b> <b>tracking</b> studies, however many aspects of this process have remained unclear. We aimed to promote mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) differentiation into germ cells and evaluate its effectiveness with tracking {{the expression of the}} Testis specific 10 (Tsga 10) during this process. Methods: This is an in vitro study that was performed in department of Medical Genetics in Tehran University of Medical Sciences from February 2012 to March 2013. Mouse embryonic stem cells were cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblast as feeder layer. Then mESCs were differentiated into germ cells in the presence of Retinoic Acid. Based on developmental schedule of the postnatal testis, samples were taken on the 7 th, 12 th and 25 th days of the culture and were subjected to expression analysis of a panel of germ cell specific genes (Stra 8 as pre-meiotic, Dazl and Sycp 3 ‌ as meiotic and Protamin 1 and Spata 19 as Post-meiotic). Expression of Testis Specific Gene 10 (Tsga 10) at RNA and protein levels was then analyzed. Results: It was shown that transition of embryonic stem cells from mitosis to meiosis occurred between 7 th and 12 th days of mESC culture and post-meiotic gene expression did not occur until 25 th day of the culture. Results showed low level of Tsga 10 expression in undifferentiated stem cells. During transition from meiotic to post-meiotic phase, Tsga 10 expression increased in 6. 6 folds. This finding is in concordance with in vivo changes during transition from pre-pubertal to pubertal stage. Localization of processed and unprocessed form of the related protein was similar to those in vivo as well. Conclusion: Expression pattern of Tsga 10, as a gene with critical function in spermatogenesis, is similar during in vitro and in vivo germ cell generation. The results suggest that in vitro derived germ cells could be a trusted model to study genes behavior during spermatogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Atherosclerosis and its {{complications}} are a {{major cause}} of death and disability and it remains a major challenge to develop new therapies for patients with irreversible end organ damage and ongoing ischaemia. The discovery of adult stem and progenitor cells with the ability to regenerate adult tissues holds great promise. Bone marrow is the source of both endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and multi-potent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs). MAPCs are rare pluripotent bone marrow derived cells with the theoretical potential to differentiate into tissues of all three germ cell layers, including endothelium. These cells may have the potential to facilitate cardiac repair. The aim of this thesis was to further characterise bone marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells including multi potent adult progenitor cells and assess their angiogenic potential and mechanisms of action in animal models of cardiovascular disease. Findings: EPCs were isolated from humans and mice and their phenotype, markers and function determined, including <b>gene</b> <b>tracking</b> experiments in mice utilising the Cre/Lox system. It was not possible to isolate cells with the same phenotype as MAPCs from rodent bone marrow. However, cells with pluri-potent properties, named rat multi-potent progenitor cells (rMPCs), were isolated from rat bone marrow. These cells had the ability to up regulate tissue specific antigens from all 3 germ cell lineages and in addition secreted multiple cytokines related to angiogenesis and inflammation. To investigate the in vivo properties of rMPCs a rat hind limb model of ischaemia was established and syngeneic rMPCs were transplanted into the ischaemic hind limbs. rMPCs engrafted selectively into the adventitia of arterioles of ischaemic muscles. However, engrafted cells did not differentiate into an endothelial or smooth muscle phenotype. Cytokine analysis of muscles 5 days after rMPC injection revealed raised levels of cytokines, including chemokines MCP 1 and SDR. Limb perfusion, measured by microspheres, increased after rMPC injection. In addition a novel MRI based assessment of ischaemic muscles revealed a significant normalisation of MRI signal after rMPC transplantation. However, there was no improvement in limb function assessed by treadmill running distance 4 weeks after cell injection. These findings suggest that transplantation of rMPCs into ischaemic muscles may modulate local inflammatory and angiogenic responses through paracrine mechanisms. Conclusion: Despite the potential for stem and progenitor cells to be used for the treatment of chronic cardiac ischaemia the biology of stem cells is still relatively poorly understood, as is the mechanism of action of cells after transplantation. As set out in the aims, the work in this thesis adds further to our understanding of both EPCs and BM derived pluri-potent stem cells. In addition it provides insight into the hind limb ischaemia model and the mechanism of action of cell therapy after transplantation into ischaemic muscle.
