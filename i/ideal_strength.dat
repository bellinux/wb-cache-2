40|$|The present thesis {{consists}} {{of a number of}} studies on the elastic properties of covalently bonded crystals, the <b>ideal</b> <b>strengths</b> of a selection of face-centred cubic (FCC) metals and the anomalously large shear modulus of iridium. Semi-empirical formulae for both bulk modulus B and shear modulus G of covalent crystals were elaborated in terms of bond length and ionicity fraction of the bonding. The resulting equations can be applied to a broad selection of covalent materials and their predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data and the results from first-principles calculations. Furthermore, the correlation between the ratio G/B and the aforementioned bonding parameters was investigated. The analysis of this relationship demonstrates that the bond length is the predominant parameter responsible for the brittle features of covalent materials. The ideal shear and tensile strengths of FCC transition metals were examined through density functional theory (DFT) -based computations. These results allowed establishing a new indicator of ductility, namely the ratio of <b>ideal</b> shear <b>strength</b> to <b>ideal</b> tensile <b>strength</b> taum/sigma . Moreover, it was found that palladium can sustain a surprisingly long range of deformation. Based on the analysis of density of states (DOS) curves, it is suggested that creation of angular features is responsible for the notable amount of distortion suffered by palladium. The electronic origin of the anomalously large elastic modulus and intrinsic brittleness of FCC iridium were studied using ab initio DFT-based calculations. The electron localisation function (ELF) and bond orders (BO) of iridium and a selection of FCC metals were calculated and then used to evaluate the directionality and the strength of the bonds. The analysis of the trend of bond strength versus elastic moduli, Cauchy pressure and the ratio of shear modulus over bulk modulus suggests that the bond strength is the primary factor that causes the abnormally high modulus of iridium and its intrinsic brittleness...|$|R

40|$|The <b>ideal</b> <b>strength</b> of a {{material}} is the stress {{at which the}} lattice itself becomes unstable and, hence, sets a firm upper bound on the mechanical strength the material can have. The present paper includes an ab-initio calculation of the ideal shear strength of Fe. It is, to our knowledge, the first such computation for any ferromagnetic material. The paper also elaborates on our earlier calculation of the ideal tensile strength of Fe by studying the effects of strains which break the tetragonal symmetry. The strengths were calculated using the Projector Augmented Wave Method {{within the framework of}} density functional theory and the generalized gradient approximation. In tension the <b>ideal</b> <b>strength</b> is determined by an elastic instability of the ferromagnetic phase along the ''Bain'' strain path from bcc to fcc. An tensile strain also leads to instability with respect to transformation into a face centered orthorhombic structure, and to various magnetic instabilities.

In both shear systems the <b>ideal</b> <b>strength</b> is determined by the body centered tetragonal structure that defines a nearby saddle point on the energy surface. The ideal shear strengths are thus very similar, though they are not identical since the two shears follow slightly different strain paths from bcc to bct.

These instabilities do not appear until the strain is significantly greater than the instability strain of the ferromagnetic crystal.

Here, we investigate, by first-principles calculations, atomic and electronic structures of the TiN/CrN interface and how the residualstress influences the adhesion and <b>ideal</b> tensile <b>strength</b> of the multilayered coatings. We find that calculated adhesion energies of the interfaces with (111) and (001) orientations are small under no residualstress, yet increase almost linearly when the residualstress is imposed, suggesting that the residualstress plays a dominant role in affecting adhesion. The strengthened adhesion affected by the residualstress is found to be attributable to the stress-induced shrinkage of bonds, which results in enhanced interactions between the bonds in the TiN/CrN coatings. Using several analytic techniques, we have characterized the electronic structure of the interface carefully and determined the interfacial bonding to be primarily ionic with a small degree of covalency. The tensile simulations reveal that the interface with the (111) texture is more brittle than that with the (001), although the former presents greater <b>ideal</b> tensile <b>strength.</b> The findings presented here shed light on the impact of residualstress on the adhesion and <b>ideal</b> tensile <b>strength</b> of the TiN/CrN multi-layers, which information could be hard to obtain by means of experiments alone but which is of practical importance for further understanding and improvement of the multi-layered coatings at atomic scal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nanoindentation is {{considered}} to be a very promising experimental approach to measuring the <b>ideal</b> shear <b>strength</b> since the stressed volume beneath the sharp indenter may be defect-free. The local shear component of the stress reaches its maximum value at some close distance from the indenter in the bulk.

This process might be detected as a pop-in on the nanoindentation load-displacement curve. To model the nanoindentation test for that purpose, three different approaches have been used in this works. The first approach is based on the analytical Hertzian solution of the stress field beneath the nanoindenter where only a continuum mechanics is taken into account. The second concept is based on the numerical solution without crystallographic considerations and the third one respects the fact that the dislocation generation in the substrate is subjected to crystallographic rules.

Here, we used density functional theory (DFT) to determine the deformation and failure mechanism of Mg_ 3 Sb_ 2, and compared with isostructural CaMg_ 2 Sb_ 2 and CaZn_ 2 Sb_ 2 crystals. Mg_ 3 Sb_ 2 is found to have a very low <b>ideal</b> shear <b>strength</b> of 1. 95 GPa. The weakly ionic Mg–Sb bond, which links the Mg^(2 +) sheet structure and the [Mg_ 2 Sb_ 2]^(2 −) substructure, breaks and creates pathways to slip between different [Mg_ 2 Sb_ 2]^(2 −) substructures under pure shear deformation in Mg_ 3 Sb_ 2. The substitution of the Mg^(2 +) sheet structure by a more electropositive Ca^(2 +) leads to a much higher <b>ideal</b> shear <b>strength</b> of 4. 07 GPa in isostructural CaMg_ 2 Sb_ 2 compared with that in Mg_ 3 Sb_ 2. The substitution of the [Mg_ 2 Sb_ 2]^(2 −) substructure by [Zn_ 2 Sb_ 2]^(2 −) in CaMg_ 2 Sb_ 2 has little influence on the mechanical strength, leading to similar <b>ideal</b> shear <b>strength</b> for the CaZn_ 2 Sb_ 2 and CaMg_ 2 Sb_ 2. To enhance the mechanical strength of Mg_ 3 Sb_ 2, we suggest that the weakly ionic Mg–Sb bond should be strengthened to improve the interaction between the Mg 2 + sheet structure and the [Mg_ 2 Sb_ 2]^(2 −) substructure by appropriate doping strategies such as the partial substitution of Mg by more electropositive cations of Ca or Sr. These deformation modes are essential to understand the intrinsic mechanical process of this novel class of thermoelectric materials, which provides insightful guidance for designing high-performance layered Zintl compounds with improved strength and ductility...|$|R

Here, we provide numerical and theoretical {{evidence to show}} that metal nanoplates exhibit an intermediate mechanical regime that occurs between elasticity and plasticity, which we call the elastic instability regime. The elastic instability regime begins with a decrease in stress, during which the nanoplates fail via global, and not local, deformation mechanisms that are distinctly different from traditional dislocation-mediated plasticity. Because the nanoplates fail via elastic instability, the governing strength criterion is the <b>ideal</b> <b>strength,</b> rather than the yield strength, and as a result, we observe a unique “smaller is weaker” trend.

This is an intriguing development; materials typically fail at stresses that are several orders of magnitude below their theoretical limits of strength. The development of engineering alloys with usable strengths near the ideal limit would have profound technological implications. The most common approach used to increase a material's strength, is grain refinement. This method has been used to produce nanograined hollow nanospheres of CdS. Under nanoindentation these spheres show remarkable strength and deformation properties. The stresses and strains in the shells are studied with linear elastic finite element analyses and from this a failure criterion is developed. The stresses predicted by the failure criteria are 2. 2 GPa, which is very large for an inherently brittle material.

The structural stability of the ternary compound {{is determined by the}} strength of Ti-Al bond, which is demonstrated to be less resistive to shear deformation than to tension. The ideal stress-strain relationships of ternary compounds are presented and compared with those of the binary materials, TiC and TiN, respectively. For Ti 2 AlC and Ti 2 AlN, their <b>ideal</b> tensile <b>strengths</b> are comparable to those of the binary counterparts, while the <b>ideal</b> shear <b>strengths</b> yield much smaller values. Based on electronic structure analyses, the low shear deformation resistance is well interpreted by the response of weak Ti-Al bonds to shear deformations. We propose that the low shear strengths of Ti 2 AlC and Ti 2 AlN originate from low slip resistance of Al atomic planes along the basal plane, and furthermore suggest that this is the mechanism for low hardness, damage tolerance, and intrinsic toughness of ternary layered carbides and nitrides...|$|R

We {{show that the}} calculated <b>ideal</b> tensile <b>strength</b> is 6.85 GPa and that the superlattice under the loading of uniaxial tensile stress becomes soft along the nonpolar axes. We also find that the appropriately applied uniaxial tensile stress can significantly enhance the piezoelectricity for the superlattice, with piezoelectric coefficient d 33 increasing from the ground state value {{by a factor of}} about 8, reaching 678.42 pC/N. The underlying mechanism for the enhancement of piezoelectricity is discussed.|$|R
