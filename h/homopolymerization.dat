Copolymerizations of ethylene glycol monomethacrylates with small amounts of dimethacrylate crosslinking agents were studied in addition to <b>homopolymerizations</b> of dimethacrylates.

40|$|The {{termination}} kinetics in free-radical bulk copolymerization of the dodecyl acrylate (DA) -dodecyl methacrylate (DMA) and DA-methyl acrylate (MA) {{systems has}} been studied by exclusively applying laser-assisted techniques. The ratio of termination to propagation rate coefficients, kt/kp, {{is measured by the}} SP-PLP technique, and kp is deduced from PLP-SEC. kt is determined up to fairly large degrees of overall monomer conversion, at least up to 40 %. The discussion of the present paper focuses on the initial plateau region of constant kt, which extends up to about 15 % in MA <b>homopolymerizations</b> and up to 70 % in DA <b>homopolymerizations.</b> Among the existing models for copolymerization kt, the treatment that considers penultimate units and uses the geometric mean approximation to estimate cross-termination turns out to be excellently applicable.

The excellent fit of kt,copo by the penultimate unit model provides some evidence that steric effects significantly contribute to termination rate control in (meth) acrylate free-radical polymerization at low and moderate degrees of monomer conversion.

50|$|Click {{chemistry}} {{reactions are}} known to be high efficiency and have fast reaction rates, yet there is considerable variability in the overall reaction rate depending on the functionality of the alkene. To better understand the kinetics of thiol-ene reactions, calculations and experiments of transition-state and reaction enthalpies were conducted for a number of alkenes and their radical intermediates. It was shown that the reactivity and structure of the alkene determines whether the reaction will follow a step- or chain-growth pathway. A currently accepted trend is that electron-rich alkenes (vinyl ether, allyl ether, etc.) and norbornene are highly reactive compared to conjugated and electron-poor alkenes (butadiene and methoxyethene). In the case of norbornene and vinyl ether only step-growth is observed, no <b>homopolymerization</b> occurs after the formation of the carbon centered radical.Due to the complex kinetics of this 2-step cyclic reaction, the rate-determining step was difficult to delineate. Given that the rates of both steps must be equal, the concentration of the radical species is determined by the rate constant of the slower of the reaction steps. Thus the overall reaction rate (RP) can be modeled by the ratio of the propagation rate (kP) to the chain-transfer rate (kCT).The behavior of the reaction rate is outlined by the relationship below. In all cases the reaction is first order, when kP>>kCT 1 the reaction rate is determined by the thiol concentration and the rate limiting step is chain-transfer, when kP<<kCT 2 the reaction rate is determined by the alkene concentration and the rate limiting step is the propagation, and finally when kP≈kCT 3 the reaction is half order with respect to both the alkene and thiol concentrations.|$|E
