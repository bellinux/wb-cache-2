500|$|Jason Bateman as Ray Embrey, a {{corporate}} public relations consultant whose life Hancock saves. Bateman said, [...] "My character sees life through rose-colored glasses so he doesn't understand how people can't see {{the positive side}} of Hancock. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> the everyman. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> the tour guide, the one who tethers whatever absurdity might be in a film and helps make that tangible to the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> home, {{having my}} routines, looking after my garden {{and playing with}} my dog, but I also love playing. I love {{being able to do}} both ... I don't know what will happen after this. I've got no plans at the moment. I'm going to see how this {{motherhood}} thing turns out.|$|E
500|$|Hendrickson told On-Air On-Soaps of {{the impact}} Chloe's daughter, Delia, has on her scenes, [...] "It’s like the best thing ever. I love the way that {{children}} change the scenes. It’s so honest, {{and you have a}} baby that is screaming and crying when she is supposed to be smiling and happy in the scene, and we have to just go, go, go, [...] and it becomes real and natural. [...] <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> mom for ten minutes and then handing them back." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do you know, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> these {{constant}} rains {{less than}} <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> snowbound up at Cedar Lodge," [...] put in Lieutenant Fred Rover.|$|R
5000|$|... “I {{really think}} the most {{important}} thing is, <b>I</b> really <b>like</b> <b>being</b> gay and <b>I</b> really <b>like</b> <b>being</b> Catholic,” she says. “If nobody ever calls me self-hating again, it will be too soon." ...|$|R
500|$|At {{the end of}} 2008, Luke {{was working}} on a track with Flo Rida called [...] "Right Round", and the two decided they needed a female hook. Luke decided to have Kesha perform on the song and within two months, it was a number one hit in {{multiple}} countries around the world. The event led to Kesha being sought after by many major labels, and she eventually signed a multi-album deal with RCA Records. Kesha explained that she chose to sign with the company due to how well she got along with RCA A executive Rani Hancock, explaining that [...] "Rani doesn't ever try to censor me, [...] and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> surrounded by strong, intelligent women." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert insisted, against Atlantic Records' initial wishes, {{that he and}} Dean {{produce the}} album together. This freed the band from the {{constraints}} of any outside producer's schedule. The recording process could then be intertwined with tour dates, which, Dean said, resulted in improved performances on the record. Dean admitted they had been spoiled by working with producer Brendan O'Brien on previous releases. [...] "I'm not so good at walking around the control room with a pen and clipboard in my hands, marking down what takes are the best. It's a lot of work. But <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> the very best I can be, and when you're producing, you are taking on everyone's performances and wanting {{it to be the}} best it can be." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally {{the video}} for [...] "Hung Up" [...] {{was to be}} {{directed}} by photographer David LaChapelle. He wanted the video to have a [...] "documentary"-style look, much like that of his 2005 film, Rize, in which five of the dancers from the [...] "Hung Up" [...] video appeared. LaChapelle and Madonna disagreed on the concept, prompting the project to be reassigned to Johan Renck, who worked with Madonna in her video for [...] "Nothing Really Matters". According to an interview with MTV, Renck was directing Kate Moss for a H commercial when he {{received a phone call}} from Madonna who desperately wanted to work with him. The next day he went to Los Angeles to meet the stylist and the choreographer hired by Madonna, who mailed him with her ideas for the video. The director explained that he [...] "kind of liked that we didn't have time to over-think this and be too clever, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> out on a limb and not know what we're doing and why. Just deal with it, the mayhem, you know?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> with him. He was a type {{of person}} I had never met {{before in my life}} and one whom I {{thoroughly}} appreciated. I sat and watched him during an interval of the conversation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> really <b>like</b> <b>being</b> a woman. ... <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it {{more now}} because I think it's {{more of a}} privilege. Norah Vincent ...|$|R
60|$|BRASSBOUND. Ah; but I'm not an aristocrat, you see. And {{like most}} poor men, I'm proud. <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>being</b> patronized.|$|R
500|$|As an {{openly gay}} man {{throughout}} his career, Sylvester {{came to be}} seen as a spokesman for the gay community. He informed a journalist that [...] "I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, they just have to be the most oppressed. They have all the hassles of finding something or someone to identify with [...] and they chose me. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> around gay people and they've proven to be some of my closest friends and most loyal audiences." [...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to do with my music. When I'm fucking I'm not thinking about singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always want me to do it their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that's for sure". He was particularly critical of [...] "clones" [...] gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches [...] stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.|$|E
2500|$|Brown's {{aversion to}} {{relationships}} with women drew tentative comparisons to {{friend and fellow}} cartoonist Dave Sim, known for his controversial views on women. [...] Brown responded to this by saying, [...] "...I don't think women are intellectually inferior to men. But <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> alone." [...] Brown also publicly debated the subject with Sim in the Getting Riel interview, while acknowledging that [...] "Cerebus #186 [...] did push me {{in the direction of}} questioning the whole romantic relationship thing".|$|E
2500|$|The book {{includes}} more than 50 letters written to the First Pets by children and more than 80 photographs of Socks and Buddy. [...] Examples of questions that letters asked include, [...] "Who do you like best? Mr. Clinton? Mrs. Clinton or Chelsea?" [...] and, [...] "How do you like being a dog, Buddy? <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> a person." [...] Socks was also {{asked if he was}} allowed to watch MTV and both pets were also asked if they ever got petted by the Spice Girls.|$|E
30|$|<b>I</b> <b>liked</b> {{the context}} and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> {{able to get}} them {{involved}} in it <b>I</b> think throughout, <b>like</b> just, <b>I</b> mean…kids are into that zombie stuff, but I mean just pulling something big and like kind of keeping that and I {{know that there were}} times where I dropped the ball in like bringing that context into it, but I think {{for the most part they}} were really excited to do it. They were really engaged in the overall context of it.|$|R
60|$|MRS. LUNN. I don't {{intend to}} give up meeting you, Mr. Juno. You amuse me very much. <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>being</b> loved: it bores me. But <b>I</b> do <b>like</b> to be amused.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{wish you}} weren't going." [...] Mrs. Hutton was almost in tears. [...] "Can't you stay? <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>being</b> {{alone in the}} house." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Duchess of Kent was {{received}} into the Catholic Church in 1994. This {{was a personal}} decision, and she received the approval of The Queen. As she explained {{in an interview on}} BBC, [...] "I do love guidelines and the Catholic Church offers you guidelines. I have always wanted that in my life. I like to know what's expected of me. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> told: You shall go to church on Sunday and if you don't you're in for it!" [...] Basil Hume, then Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster and thus spiritual leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, warned the Church against triumphalism over the Duchess's conversion.|$|E
2500|$|Danzig {{has said}} he wishes to avoid {{extensive}} and exhaustive touring in the future, preferring instead to focus on his various music, film and comic book projects: [...] "I don’t really want to tour. My reason for not doing it is because I’m bored of it. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> onstage, but I don’t like sitting around all day doing nothing. I could be home, working." [...] Danzig has started work on a third Black Aria album, and a covers album is set for release {{by the end of}} 2013. Danzig hopes to record a dark blues album involving Jerry Cantrell and Hank III. He is currently working on new Danzig material with Tommy Victor and Johnny Kelly.|$|E
2500|$|... "I'm not a 'sex queen' or a 'sex symbol,' [...] " [...] Taylor said. [...] "I don't think I {{want to be}} one. Sex symbol kind of {{suggests}} bathrooms {{in hotels}} or something. I do know I'm a movie star and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> a woman, and I think sex is absolutely gorgeous. But {{as far as a}} sex goddess, I don't worry myself that way... Richard is a very sexy man. He's got that sort of jungle essence that one can sense... When we look at each other, it's like our eyes have fingers and they grab ahold.... I think I ended up being the scarlet woman because of my rather puritanical upbringing and beliefs. I couldn't just have a romance. It had to be a marriage." ...|$|E
60|$|I saw nothing; {{but neither}} the sheep nor he would go on so I bid him take the road lower down. He {{probably}} raised the phantoms from thinking, as he traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he had heard his parents and companions repeat. Yet, still, <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>being</b> out in the dark now; and <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>being</b> left by myself in this grim house: I cannot help it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift to the Grange.|$|R
6000|$|... "There will be," [...] she said, and she lighted {{the lamp}} under the pot. [...] "But <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>being</b> scared out {{of half a}} year's growth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They say the House is a {{comfortable}} club," [...] said the middle-aged friend, [...] "but I confess that <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>like</b> <b>being</b> rung {{away from my}} dinner myself." ...|$|R
2500|$|While {{composing}} Rebel Heart, Madonna {{would get}} [...] "fleeting moments of ideas" [...] {{of what she}} would like to perform on the tour. After the promotional performances supporting the album, she had a concrete imagery about the themes {{she would like to}} incorporate. [...] "I like to create personas and then the persona changes and grows into other things... I'm at the beginning of that process right now, in terms of thinking of my tour and stuff," [...] the singer explained. Rehearsals for the tour occurred for 10–12 hours per day. She added: [...] "When I go on tour, I like the rehearsal. I like the creation of everything. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> able to wear my rehearsal clothes and be sweaty and not having to worry about how I look and just get into what it is I'm trying to say and do." [...] Unlike The MDNA Tour, Madonna confirmed that her son Rocco would not perform onstage, but would instead work behind the scenes of Rebel Heart Tour.|$|E

6000|$|... "Stuff and nonsense," [...] snorted my aunt; [...] "does {{she think}} I'm a fool. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> disagreeable. I {{like to see}} 'em squirming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} have; but why shouldn't it be your duty {{to make your}} {{relations}} happy? If you could only know how much <b>I</b> <b>like</b> your <b>being</b> here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{suggested}} to Zulime {{that she would}} be more comfortable at the Agency but she replied, [...] "I'd rather go with you. <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>being</b> left here alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better for you. I'll leave her to you, for I shall be shut up. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> her <b>being</b> placed under my 'care'!" [...] my friend cried.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> so rich," [...] said Augusta rising and {{coming down the}} long table to her husband, when at last Johnson had softly closed the door. [...] "It oppresses me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she returned, lightly, [...] "if it's {{anything}} like neighborliness as I've {{seen it in}} small places, deliver me from it! <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> independent. That's why I like the city. You're let alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will {{sleep on}} one of the sofas in the saloon, captain. I should not feel {{comfortable}} if I turned you out; and besides, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> able to pop quietly on deck, whenever I feel inclined: so that is settled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid it's too late, now," [...] said Dorothy, regretfully. [...] "It was {{a splendid}} plan, but we've got {{troubles}} of our own, and <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>being</b> a lamb at all." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{my blood}} is up!" [...] she said, and she pounded his {{shoulder}} with her fist. [...] "I'll fight--I'll fight! ... I couldn't avoid Van. It was Holley {{who told me}} Van was threatening you. And when I met Van he told me how everybody said you insulted me--had been worse than a drunken rider--and that he'd beat you half to death. So I told Van Joel Creech might have seen us--I didn't doubt that--but he didn't see that <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> hugged." ...|$|R
