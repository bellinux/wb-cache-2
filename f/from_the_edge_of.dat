5|$|Cole {{once again}} found {{himself with a}} chance in the Bayern box, but keeper Oliver Kahn hurried out of his goal to punch the ball to safety. At the other end, Basler came close with another free kick before Alexander Zickler sent a shot just wide <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the box.

In January 2009, the opening was delayed because the tracks were too far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the platform. The problem was corrected and the station opened on March 16, 2009, with a new free transfer to between the 1 and the N, R, and W trains at the older Whitehall Street station.

The first primary osteoderms on the pelvis are large, compressed from the sides, and have a sharp, short point. S. sp. was preserved with five fragmentary scutes from the pelvis. One fragment includes two small scutes with a ridge down the middle, joining the two together, and a compressed osteoderm with a small spike. It is thought that the fragment was <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the pelvic region. Another fragment includes two oval osteoderms with small ossicles fused between them. Pelvic shields were probably formed on struthiosaurines by these scutes.|$|E

The line would have two southern branches that would diverge at 14th Street. A connection to the BMT Canarsie Line would use a pair of the tracks, while the other pair would go to Atlantic Avenue and Hicks Street in Brooklyn through an East River tunnel. Then it would turn down to Red Hook. There would also be a loop at Battery Park. Another branch would be built; it would consist of two tracks, and would go between 162nd Street and 190th Street via Amsterdam Avenue.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Stevenage, Byrom joined League One side Preston North End, then {{managed by}} Graham Westley, who had {{previously}} signed him for Stevenage. He signed on a free transfer. Byrom made his competitive debut for Preston in the club's 2–1 away victory over Bury, coming on as a second-half substitute. It took Byrom just three games to open his goalscoring account, scoring the first goal in the club's 5–0 win over Hartlepool United at Deepdale. In the club's following match four days later, on 22 September 2012, he netted in a 3–1 away defeat to Walsall, arriving unmarked {{in the area to}} give Preston an early lead in the match. His third and final goal of the campaign came at the beginning of November 2012, scoring <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the area in Preston's 3–0 FA Cup win over Yeovil Town. Byrom made 27 appearances, eleven of which as a substitute, during his first season with the club, scoring three times.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} {{in both of}} Stevenage's opening fixtures of 2011–12, Charles signed a contract extension on 11 August 2011, keeping him contracted to the club until 2013. Two days later, Charles scored his first goal {{of the season with}} a close range header in a 1–1 draw away at Chesterfield. Charles' appearances were sporadic throughout the remainder of 2011, with the player suffering from a knee injury. He made his first start in nearly two months in Stevenage's 1–0 away victory against Reading at the Madejski Stadium in the FA Cup on 7 January 2012, with Charles scoring the winning goal in the first-half with a finish <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the area. Charles' season ended prematurely after he suffered a hamstring injury in Stevenage's 1–1 draw with Wycombe Wanderers on 31 March 2012, with the injury ruling him out of action for up to six weeks. He made 34 appearances during the season, scoring five times.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the return}} of Tesche on a {{permanent}} contract seemed likely to endanger Davis's first-team place, he began the 2016–17 season in the starting eleven. He was booked {{in each of the}} first four matches, but two goals and a series of strong performances meant that when the fifth booking finally arrived in mid-October, he came straight back into the side after serving his suspension. He was named man of the match in the Second City derby against Aston Villa. Initially used on the right of midfield to counteract the attacking threat of Jordan Amavi, he moved into a more familiar central role after David Cotterill entered the match, and within minutes scored the equalising goal with a composed finish <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the penalty area. The goal earned him the club's Moment of the Season award.|$|E
5|$|At daylight, German tanks {{caught the}} 24th and 25th Battalions, {{positioned}} {{in the relatively}} shallow El Mrier Depression together with 6th Brigade headquarters, by surprise. Firing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a low cliff overlooking the depression, the Germans caused heavy losses amongst the 24th and 25th Battalions before passing through their positions {{in pursuit of the}} British armour. George, the battalion's commander, was captured along with 149 others. Over 200 other men were also killed or wounded. The survivors, back under the command of Burton who was once again the senior surviving company commander, were aggrieved at the lack of armoured support. The 6th Brigade moved to the southern section of the Alamein line where it manned defensive positions during the Battle of Alam Halfa, Rommel's failed attempt to cut off the 8th Army. The battalion at this time numbered 362 personnel, which included one company which had been left back at Maadi and brought forward to rejoin the survivors of the El Mrier battle. Burton, promoted to lieutenant colonel, commanded the battalion until 12 September at which time he went on leave and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Ian Bonifant.|$|E
5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> {{the water and}} seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance {{and seemed to be}} pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E

5|$|For {{the second}} time that season, Barcelona played Real Madrid in El Clásico, this time at the Santiago Bernabéu.

On 6 May 2009, Barcelona played against Chelsea in the second leg of the Champions League semi-finals. Following a goalless first leg, Chelsea led the second leg at Stamford Bridge 1–0, from the eighth minute until injury time, when Andrés Iniesta scored an equaliser in the 93rd minute <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the penalty area, sending Barcelona through to the final on the away goals rule.

Henry replaced the keep with another stone shell keep and chemise wall, but moved the walls in <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the motte to relieve the pressure on the mound, and added massive foundations along the south side to provide additional support. Inside the castle Henry remodelled the royal accommodation. Bagshot Heath stone was used for most of the work, and stone from Bedfordshire for the internal buildings.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{suffered}} from soreness {{in his leg}} after collapsing in a match against Rushden & Diamonds in December 2001. He returned to action to score <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the penalty area in a 3–1 away victory against Swansea City on 30 March 2002; this goal secured Luton's promotion to the Second Division at the first attempt. Holmes' 2001–02 season was ended with 10 appearances and one goal after suffering a knee ligament injury during Luton's 4–0 victory at Hull City on 6 April 2002. He suffered a groin strain during the 2–1 home defeat to Cambridge United in the Football League Trophy on 10 December 2002. He made his return to Luton's first team in a 3–2 away defeat to Mansfield Town on 4 March 2003 after coming on as a 74th-minute substitute. He then scored in the following match against Huddersfield Town, being assisted by an Ian Hillier cross in the 71st-minute to help Luton to a 3–0 victory on 8 March 2003. He finished 2002–03 with 23 appearances and two goals, but missed Luton's final match of the season after picking up a hamstring injury during a 1–1 draw with Stockport County on 26 April 2003.|$|E
