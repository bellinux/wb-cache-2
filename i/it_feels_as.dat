5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E

Steve Mullen praised the episode not only for the Michael/Dwight war, but also for smaller moments like the cheese puff tosses and the messages Pam and Ryan wrote on a clipboard for Michael during his phone call; Mullen said, [...] "I'm not sure any other 30 minute comedy currently on TV can even touch The Office."

5000|$|The average yearly {{temperature}} of Namwon is 12.3℃ {{with the average}} temperature in January being -1.4℃ and 25.2℃ in August. Due to its location in a mountainous basin with {{a high rate of}} precipitation, the climate of Namwon varies greatly. Winds in Namwon are usually weak and blow north to west in the winter and south to west in the summer. However, temperatures can sometimes (briefly) drop below -10℃ in January with wind chills making <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though <b>it</b> were below -15℃. These winds are part of a cold front that comes down from Siberia for a very brief time. Temperatures in July and August can often reach 33℃, with the humidity making <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though <b>it</b> were in the 40's℃. The humidity over the Korean peninsula from June through September comes from south east Asia. Temperatures in spring (late April and through May) and fall (after September 25 and through October) are often in the mid 20's℃ and with low humidity.|$|R
500|$|Reviewers {{were divided}} {{as to the}} merits of the novel's ending. Andy Smith lamented that the finale of the [...] "mostly intriguing" [...] novel was [...] "distinctly anticlimactic". Tim Martin wrote that it seemed [...] "somehow less {{than the sum of its}} parts". Clay Evans {{dismissed}} it as [...] "not especially meaningful, but fun", whereas Matt Thorne found it lacking [...] "a traditional thriller's excitement". San Francisco Chronicle reviewer Michael Berry called it [...] "an ingenious reversal" [...] which proved that despite its apparent cynicism, the novel was [...] "oddly optimistic for a ghost story". Overall, Thorne judged the novel ultimately unsatisfactory on account of the underwhelming ending and because Gibson [...] "hides the full complications of the plot so successfully that <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> if everything important is happening offstage". Roger Perkins judged the novel to be [...] "a triumph of style over substance – which is exactly the way you suspect that Gibson wants it." [...] His colleague Martin mused that along with the regular Gibsonian tropes, there was [...] "something new ... a dark and very contemporary surge of suspicion and bad faith" [...] in the novel which suggested that the author might be approaching the apex of his writing. Dan Conover concluded that while the [...] "darkly comic satire" [...] was [...] "a worthy addition to the Gibson canon and a significant cultural artifact", it would not rank among the author's best works.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club Alasdair Wilkins gave [...] "The Bells of Saint John" [...] a {{grade of}} B, {{explaining}} that the plot suffered just as previous companion introductions had because the threat was secondary to establishing Clara. He also wrote that the episode [...] "struggles to make all its chosen genre elements compelling" [...] and was not positive towards the menace of the Wi-Fi and questioned how realistic the technology seen was. Despite this, {{he said that it}} was still [...] "fun" [...] with good performances. Dan Martin of The Guardian was disappointed, writing that it [...] "makes a hearty meal of its iconic London locations ... But after the tour de force that was [...] "The Snowmen", <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> though this handsome episode constantly just misses the mark". He found the monsters and plot familiar to past episodes, but noted that a [...] "generic" [...] opening episode had been common for the show when it was introducing a new companion, which was done successfully with Clara. Neela Debnath in The Independent echoed similar sentiments, feeling that it did not live up to the hype and reused several elements from previous episodes. Jon Cooper of the Daily Mirror wrote that [...] "The Bells of Saint John" [...] "had its moments" [...] but [...] "as a whole it didn't reach the heights of previous episodes". While he welcomed the departure in tone, he felt that the set-pieces were shoehorned in, and also expressed concern that Clara, despite Coleman's success, was too similar to previous companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan).|$|E

[...] According to Fashion Bomb Daily, Brandy was styled in a Versace Barocco Printed Silk-Twill Shirt that costed $1,275. Robbie Daw of Idolator also said that Monica and Brandy looked [...] "stunning", but added that the plotline of the video {{could have been more}} creative. Maritess Calabria of RyanSeacrest.com thought that the video reflects on how women can be powerful in terms of money in a relationship, and completed, [...] "just as easily as they give it, they can take it all away." [...] Chris Eggertsen of Hitfix gave the video a negative review, and said [...] "that <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> lifeless and pre-fab as the song it's been built around."

2500|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviews. Review normalizer Metacritic {{gave the}} album 50 out of 100 based on 9 critical reviews. Andy Kellman of AllMusic said [...] "Timbaland does not stock Shock Value II with quite as many guests, and performs {{a higher percentage}} of the vocals, and what results is less schizophrenic and more directly pop than its antecedent. The highs here are not as high, and the lows are as low, unless you consider the very presence of Chad Kroeger and Daughtry, or the unveiling of Brandy’s rapping alter ego Bran’ Nu, to be more odious than a sub-Coldplay ballad. [...] That said, it is a mildly entertaining album—as long as you block out most of the lyrics." [...] David Balls of Digital Spy agreed saying that [...] "Timbaland dips into his usual bag of production tricks here and many of the supporting cast dutifully return, but never does this quite reach the same excitement levels as its predecessor. [...] <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> though Tim's trying so hard to impress us with his pimped-up SUV that he's driven the thing off the road. The result? A disparate, disjointed collection of songs that feels like less {{than the sum of its}} parts. Where Shock Value was fresh and innovative, much of the sequel could pass for leftovers from its predecessor. [...] He now seems to be lagging behind rivals like David Guetta and will.iam when it comes to driving the urban pop genre forward" ...|$|E

40|$|What we are {{investigating}} {{in this article}} is the great importance of the theme of time in relation to human reality according to the thought of Zubiri.

Intelligence <b>feels</b> and <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> things <b>as</b> real.  Thus, <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> them <b>as</b> merely being in the world. It is the essence of reality. While sensing things as being in the world, intelligence senses them as temporary, because one is temporarily in this world. This is the mode of being; time is radically the mode of being.

6000|$|In ancient times, as story tells, The saints {{would often}} leave their cells, And stroll about, but hide their quality, To try good people's hospitality. [...] It happen'd {{on a winter}} night, As authors of the legend write, Two brother hermits, saints by trade, Taking their tour in masquerade, Disguis'd in tatter'd habits, went To a small village down in Kent; Where, in the strollers' canting strain, They begg'd from door to door in vain, Try'd ev'ry tone might pity win; But not a soul would let them in. [...] Our wand'ring saints, in woful state, Treated at this ungodly rate, Having thro' all the village past, To a small cottage came at last Where dwelt a good old honest ye'man, Call'd in the {{neighbourhood}} Philemon; Who kindly did these saints invite In his poor hut to pass the night; And then the hospitable sire Bid Goody Baucis mend the fire; While he from out the chimney took A flitch of bacon off the hook, And freely from the fattest side Cut out large slices to be fry'd; Then stepp'd aside to fetch 'em drink, Fill'd a large jug up to the brink, And saw it fairly twice go round; Yet (what was wonderful) they found 'Twas still replenished to the top, As if they ne'er had touch'd a drop. The good old couple were amaz'd, And often on each other gaz'd; For both were frighten'd to the heart, And just began to cry, [...] "What art!" [...] Then softly turn'd aside, to view Whether the lights were burning blue. The gentle pilgrims, soon aware on't, Told them their calling and their errand: [...] "Good folk, you need not be afraid, We are but saints," [...] the hermits said; [...] "No hurt shall come to you or yours: But for that pack of churlish boors, Not fit to live on Christian ground, They and their houses shall be drown'd; While you shall see your cottage rise, And grow a church before your eyes." [...] They scarce had spoke, when fair and soft, The roof began to mount aloft; Aloft rose ev'ry beam and rafter; The heavy wall climb'd slowly after. [...] The chimney widen'd, and grew higher Became a steeple with a spire. [...] The kettle to the top was hoist, And there stood fasten'd to a joist, But with the upside down, to show Its inclination for below: In vain; for a superior force Applied at bottom stops its course: Doom'd ever in suspense to dwell, 'Tis now no kettle, but a bell. [...] A wooden jack, which had almost Lost by disuse the art to roast, A sudden alteration feels, Increas'd by new intestine wheels; And, what exalts the wonder more, The number made the motion slower. The flyer, though it had leaden feet, Turn'd round so quick you scarce could see't; But, slacken'd by some secret power, Now hardly moves an inch an hour. The jack and chimney, near ally'd, Had never left each other's side; The chimney to a steeple grown, The jack would not be left alone; But, up against the steeple rear'd, Became a clock, and still adher'd; And still its love to household cares, By a shrill voice at noon, declares, Warning the cookmaid not to burn That roast meat, which it cannot turn. The groaning-chair began to crawl, Like an huge snail, half up the wall; There stuck aloft in public view, And with small change, a pulpit grew. [...] The porringers, that in a row Hung high, and made a glitt'ring show, To a less noble substance chang'd, Were now but leathern buckets rang'd. [...] The ballads, pasted on the wall, Of Joan[2] of France, and English Mall,[3] Fair Rosamond, and Robin Hood, The little Children in the Wood, Now seem'd to look abundance better, Improved in picture, size, and letter: And, high in order plac'd, describe The heraldry of ev'ry tribe.[4] [...] A bedstead of the antique mode, Compact of timber many a load, Such as our ancestors did use, Was metamorphos'd into pews; Which still their ancient nature keep By lodging folk disposed to sleep. [...] The cottage, by such feats as these, Grown to a church by just degrees, The hermits then desired their host To ask for what he fancy'd most. Philemon, having paused a while, Return'd them thanks in homely style; Then said, [...] "My house is grown so fine, Methinks, I still would call it mine. I'm old, and fain would live at ease; Make me the parson if you please." [...] He spoke, and presently he feels His grazier's coat fall down his heels: He sees, yet hardly can believe, About each arm a pudding sleeve; His waistcoat to a cassock grew, And both assumed a sable hue; But, being old, continued just As threadbare, and as full of dust. His talk was now of tithes and dues: Could smoke his pipe, and read the news; Knew how to preach old sermons next, Vamp'd in the preface and the text; At christ'nings well could act his part, And had the service all by heart; Wish'd women might have children fast, And thought whose sow had farrow'd last; Against dissenters would repine, And stood up firm for [...] "right divine;" [...] Found his head fill'd with many a system; But classic authors,--he ne'er mist 'em. [...] Thus having furbish'd up a parson, Dame Baucis next they play'd their farce on. Instead of homespun coifs, were seen Good pinners edg'd with colberteen; Her petticoat, transform'd apace, Became black satin, flounced with lace. [...] "Plain Goody" [...] would no longer down, 'Twas [...] "Madam," [...] in her grogram gown. Philemon was in great surprise, And hardly could believe his eyes. Amaz'd to see her look so prim, And she admir'd as much at him. [...] Thus happy in their change of life, Were several years this man and wife: When on a day, which prov'd their last, Discoursing o'er old stories past, They went by chance, amidst their talk, [5]To the churchyard to take a walk; When Baucis hastily cry'd out, [...] "My dear, I see your forehead sprout!"-- [...] "Sprout;" [...] quoth the man; [...] "what's this you tell us? I hope you don't believe me jealous! But yet, methinks, I feel it true, And really yours is budding too--Nay,--now I cannot stir my foot; <b>It</b> <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> if 'twere taking root." [...] Description would but tire my Muse, In short, they both were turn'd to yews. Old Goodman Dobson of the Green Remembers he the trees has seen; He'll talk of them from noon till night, And goes with folk to show the sight; On Sundays, after evening prayer, He gathers all the parish there; Points out the place of either yew, Here Baucis, there Philemon, grew: Till once a parson of our town, To mend his barn, cut Baucis down; At which, 'tis hard to be believ'd How much the other tree was griev'd, Grew scrubby, dy'd a-top, was stunted, So the next parson stubb'd and burnt it.|$|E
