40|$|During {{the long}} {{economic}} slump in Japan, monetary policy in Japan has essentially {{consisted of a}} very low interest rate (since 1995), a zero interest rate (since 1999), and quantitative easing (since 2001). The intention {{seems to have been}} to lower <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> future interest rates. But the problem in a liquidity trap (when the zero lower bound on the central bank’s instrument rate is strictly binding) is rather to raise private-sector <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> the future price level. Increased <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> a higher future price level are likely to be much more effective in reducing the real interest rate and stimulating the economy out of a liquidity trap than a further reduction of already very low <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> future interest rates. Therefore, monetarypolicy alternatives in a liquidity trap should be assessed according to how effective {{they are likely to be}} in affecting private-sector <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> the future price level. <b>Expectations</b> <b>of</b> a higher future price level would lead to current depreciation of the currency.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} inflation and inflation <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> analysts, business, and trade unions in South Africa during the inflation targeting (IT) regime. We consider inflation expectations based on the Bureau of Economic Research (BER) quarterly survey observed from 2000 Q 1 to 2013 Q 1. We estimate inflation <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> individual agents as the weighted average of lagged inflation and the inflation target. The results indicate that expectations are heterogeneous across agents. <b>Expectations</b> <b>of</b> price setters (business and unions) {{are closely related to}} each other and are higher than the upper bound of the official target band, while <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> analysts are within the target band. In addition, <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> price setters are somewhat related to lagged inflation and the opposite is true for analysts. The results reveal that the SARB has successfully anchored <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> analysts but that price setters have not sufficiently used the focal point implicit in the inflation targeting regime.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> {{children and their}} primary care-givers towards orthodontic treatment and to compare the results with those of a UK sample. Design: A questionnaire survey of children and their primary care-givers attending for their first consultation. Setting: The Department of Orthodontics at the Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA), the Netherlands. Subjects and methods: A total of 168 subjects (84 patients and 84 parents) completed the questionnaire. The children were aged 10 to 14 years. The responses {{of the children and}} parents and differences between boys and girls were examined using parametric statistical methods. The data from the Dutch sample were compared with a similar UK sample. Results: Patients and parents shared similar <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> orthodontic treatment, with the exception <b>of</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> having a brace fitted at the first appointment, orthodontic treatment involving headgear, any problems with orthodontic treatment, duration of orthodontic treatment and concerning reactions from the public. Among the child participants, boys and girls only differed in their <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> orthodontic treatment involving jaw surgery. Differences between Dutch and English participants were found regarding the first visit, type of orthodontic treatment, reactions from the public, and pain and problems with orthodontic treatment. Conclusions: Since the <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> patients and their parents differ on several aspects, effective communication between the orthodontist, patient and parent is considered to be essential. Our hypothesis that Dutch patients’ and parents’ <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> orthodontic treatment differ from the <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> English patients and parents was supported...|$|R

An unknown poet retained, as in the other chorale cantatas of Bach's second cantata cycle, the hymn's first and last stanza unchanged, but paraphrased the themes of the inner stanzas to a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the cantata for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two oboes da caccia, two solo violins, strings and continuo. All instruments play in the opening festive chorale fantasia, while the soprano carries the hymn tune and the lower voices answer in counterpoint of instrumental motifs. An oboe da caccia accents the first aria, the solo violins and strings return in the second aria, and an independent horn part crowns the closing chorale.|$|E
