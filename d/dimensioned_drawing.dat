40|$|Habitability {{improvements}} {{for early}} flights {{that could be}} implemented with minimum impact were investigated. These included: (1) launching the water dispenser in the on-orbit position instead of in a locker; (2) the sleep pallet concept; and (3) suction cup foot restraints. Past studies that used volumetric terms and requirements for crew size versus mission duration were reviewed and common definitions of key habitability terms were established. An accurately <b>dimensioned</b> <b>drawing</b> of the orbiter mid-deck, locating all of the known major elements was developed. Finally, it was established that orbiter duration and crew size can be increased with minimum modification and impact to the crew module. Preliminary concepts of the aft med-deck, external versions of expanded tunnel adapters (ETA), and interior concepts of ETA- 3 were developed and comparison charts showing the various factors of volume, weight, duration, size, impact to orbiter, and number of sleep stations were generated...|$|E
40|$|Geometric {{dimensioning}} and tolerancing, or GD&T, is {{a symbolic}} language that permits design engineers, manufacturing personnel, and quality inspectors {{to communicate in}} an e cient and e ective manner. This communication focuses on providing a clear de nition of geometric features (e. g., surfaces, holes) and the allowable variation that each feature may contain. Unfortunately, owing in part to its complex rule based system, GD&T is also di cult to teach and learn. To address this di culty, a technique has been developed that allows students to visualize geometric tolerances and tolerance zones, and to directly see when a given data point is {{in or out of}} tolerance. The technique employs a portable coordinate measuring machine (CMM) interfaced with parametric solid modeling software, a 3 D printer, and a granite surface table to accomplish this. A set of engineering drawings is created, and a 3 D printer is used to produce imperfect parts. These imperfections are intended to represent signi cant manufacturing variation. Then using a portable CMM and the surface table, data points are taken to visually map this manufacturing variation to a 3 D parametric modeling software package. Within this software a perfect part is also modeled. Once the inspection data is taken, datum features on the perfect part are used to form the boundaries of the geometric tolerance zones. Through this process, students interactively learn the meaning of datum references, as well as how the various tolerances create di erent zones. Finally, students use the parametric modeling software to measure the inspection data points to visually see how in or out of speci cation a given feature is. Having developed a basic working understanding of GD&T, a second module is used to convey design intent through the use of GD&T. Using a simple assembly, students are charged with providing a fully toleranced drawing for one component of this assembly. Students are given a fully <b>dimensioned</b> <b>drawing</b> with basic dimensions and a list of t, form, and functional requirements. From these resources, students must choose a datum scheme, tolerance part features, and explain which requirements drive their decisions. In summary, the goal of these educational modules is to illustrate the complex topics of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing through practical application...|$|E
