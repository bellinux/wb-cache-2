After realizing {{it would be difficult}} to <b>fake,</b> <b>it</b> was decided to shoot the majority of the film on location in Cape Town, South Africa. Filming took place from June 4 to June 20 with the final scenes being shot in Los Angeles, California. By July 13, principal shooting of the film had been completed and post-production had begun.|$|E
25|$|The Deep: An {{adaptation}} of Charles Williams' Dead Calm. The picture was entirely set on two boats and shot mostly in close-ups, and was filmed off {{the coasts of}} Yugoslavia and the Bahamas, between 1966 and 1969, with all but one scene completed. Originally planned as commercially viable thriller, to show that Welles could make a popular, successful film. It was put on hold in 1970 when Welles worried that critics would not respond favourably to this film as his theatrical follow-up to the much-lauded Chimes at Midnight, and Welles focused instead on F for <b>Fake.</b> <b>It</b> was abandoned altogether in 1973 due {{to the death of}} its star Laurence Harvey.|$|E

25|$|Public {{awareness}} {{was increased}} by {{the works of}} the eccentric collector Thomas Hawkins, a pre-Adamite believing that ichthyosaurs were monstrous creations by the devil: Memoirs of Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri of 1834 and The Book of the Great Sea-Dragons of 1840. The first work was illustrated by mezzotints by John Samuelson Templeton. These publications also contained scientific descriptions and represented the first textbooks of the subject. In the summer of 1834, Hawkins, after a taxation by William Buckland and Gideon Mantell, sold his extensive collection, then the largest {{of its kind in the}} world, to the British Museum. However, curator Koenig quickly discovered that the fossils had been heavily restored with plaster, applied by an Italian artist from Lucca; of the most attractive piece, an Ichthyosaurus specimen, almost the entire tail was <b>fake.</b> <b>It</b> turned out that Professor Buckland had been aware of this beforehand, and the museum was forced to reach a settlement with Hawkins, and gave the fake parts a lighter colour to differentiate them from the authentic skeletal elements.|$|E
500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called [...] "Alive" [...] the [...] "biggest surprise" [...] of J to tha L–O! The Remixes. William Ruhlmann of Allmusic {{gave the}} song a {{negative}} review, writing that her vocal limitations [...] "come {{to the fore}} when she is spotlighted on such a song without a dance arrangement to support her". He stated, however, that her vocal limitations are not [...] "as big a deal" [...] as her lack of emotional involvement: [...] "Though she tries to <b>fake</b> <b>it</b> here and there, she still sounds like she's singing her grocery list instead of the song's clichéd lyrics". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "syrupy ballad" [...] that is [...] "neither alive nor a remix". He stated that {{if you listen to}} the song long enough, [...] "you may actually be conned into thinking Lopez's voice and songs are passable".

500|$|The song {{starts with}} an {{electric}} guitar riff comparable {{to the music of}} English alternative rock band Oasis. The chords harmonize with each other, continuing for 22 seconds. The techno melody then begins, consisting of a main synth sound oscillating on the primary musical note, with the EQ moving between the bass and the treble. The [...] "restless" [...] beat is accompanied by a rock-inspired chord riff, with Madonna's pitch being higher than the other tracks from the album. While recording, Orbit kept [...] "Ray of Light" [...] a semitone higher than the singer's limit, resulting in a strain added to the vocals. [...] "She got frustrated when we were recording but you want that bit of edge with singers, that thing of reaching. You can't <b>fake</b> <b>it,</b> and you can hear it when she cracks it on the record," [...] he recalled. Before the final chorus there is a synth solo again, reminiscent of a 1970s pro-rock record. According to Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, this was a link to the origin of the song from [...] "Sepheryn".|$|E

500|$|Portman and Kunis started {{training}} {{six months}} before the start of filming in order to attain a body type and muscle tone more similar to those of professional dancers. Portman worked out for five hours a day, doing ballet, cross-training, and swimming. A few months closer to filming, she began choreography training. Kunis engaged in cardio and Pilates, [...] "train seven days a week, five hours, for five, six months total, and ... was put on a very strict diet of 1,200 calories a day." [...] She lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds, and reported that Portman [...] "became smaller than I did." [...] Kunis said, [...] "I did ballet as a kid like every other kid does ballet. You wear a tutu and you stand on stage and you look cute and twirl.

[...] Georgina Parkinson, a ballet mistress from the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), coached the actors in ballet.

It was not until 1995 that Corgan finished the song with the noted chorus [...] "rat in a cage", on an acoustic guitar during the same session that [...] "Landslide" [...] was recorded.

6000|$|There {{could be}} no {{stronger}} contrast to him in origin, education, and character than a man who lived {{at the same time}} in Cambridge, and who produced a book which in its final fidelity to life is not unworthy to be named with 'Two Years Before the Mast.' Ralph Keeler wrote the 'Vagabond Adventures' which he had lived. I have it on my heart to name him in the presence of our great literary men not only because I had an affection for him, tenderer than I then knew, but because I believe his book is worthier of more remembrance than it seems to enjoy. I was reading it only the other day, and I found it delightful, and much better than I imagined when I accepted for the Atlantic the several papers which it is made up of. I am not sure but it belongs to the great literature in that fidelity to life which I have spoken of, and which the author brought himself to practise with such difficulty, and under so much stress from his editor. He really wanted to <b>fake</b> <b>it</b> at times, but he was docile at last and did it so honestly that it tells the history of his strange career in much better terms than it can be given again. He had been, as he claimed, [...] "a cruel uncle's ward" [...] in his early orphan-hood, and while yet almost a child he had run away from home, to fulfil his heart's desire of becoming a clog-dancer in a troupe of negro minstrels. But it was first his fate to be cabin-boy and bootblack on a lake steamboat, and meet with many squalid adventures, scarcely to be matched outside of a Spanish picaresque novel. When he did become a dancer (and even a danseuse) of the sort he aspired to be, the fruition of his hopes was so little what he imagined that he was very willing to leave the Floating Palace on the Mississippi in which his troupe voyaged and exhibited, and enter the college of the Jesuit Fathers at Cape Girardeau in Missouri. They were very good to him, and in their charge he picked up a good deal more Latin, if not less Greek than another strolling player who also took to literature. From college Keeler went to Europe, and then to California, whence he wrote me that he was coming on to Boston with the manuscript of a novel which he wished me to read for the magazine. I reported against it to my chief, but nothing could shake Keeler's faith in it, until he had printed it at his own cost, and known it fail instantly and decisively. He had come to Cambridge to see it through the press, and he remained there four or five years, with certain brief absences. Then, during the Cuban insurrection of the early seventies, he accepted the invitation of a New York paper to go to Cuba as its correspondent.|$|E
