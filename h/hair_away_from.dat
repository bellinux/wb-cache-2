Belle's tendency to constantly brush her <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her face was also inspired by both Stoner and O'Hara. [...] "I was constantly doing that and little quirky things that they would catch," [...] O'Hara told The Guardian. The animators also incorporated O'Hara's eyes, cheekbones {{and the way in}} which she raises her eyebrow into Belle's face. O'Hara felt that Belle originally looked [...] "too perfect," [...] likening the character's appearance to actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Angelina Jolie. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Solomon observed inconsistencies in Belle's appearance, writing, [...] "The prettiest and liveliest Belle waltzes with Beast in his marble ballroom and weeps over his body before he's transformed into the Prince" [...] while [...] "The Belle who receives the library from Beast has wider-set eyes and a more prominent mouth than the noticeably slimmer Belle who sings 'Something There'".|$|E
2500|$|Afro, {{sometimes}} {{abbreviated to}} 'fro and {{also known as}} a [...] "natural", is a hairstyle worn naturally outward by people with lengthy, or even medium length, kinky hair texture or specifically styled in such a fashion by individuals with naturally curly or straight hair. The hairstyle is created by combing the <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the scalp, allowing the hair to extend out from the head in a large, rounded shape, much like a cloud or ball.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} photographer, with a {{momentary}} glance at my face, [...] "the eyebrows are removed. We have a process now--the Delphide--for putting in new ones. You'll notice here where we've applied it {{to carry the}} <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the brow. I don't like the hair low on the skull." ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The bow is woven {{between the}} strings. Because the hairs are slackened, the bow hand {{is used to}} press the <b>hairs</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the bow stick to create enough tension to stroke the strings properly.|$|R
6000|$|She {{wore her}} <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> [...] <b>From</b> her forehead,--like a cloud [...] Which a little wind in May [...] Peels off finely: {{disallowed}} [...] Though {{bright enough to}} stay.|$|R
5000|$|The under jaw is {{well-developed}} {{and helps}} give a round or octagonal shape {{to the head}} when viewed from the front. Coarse <b>hairs</b> stand <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the cheeks.|$|R
60|$|The stony street, {{the bitter}} {{north-east}} wind and darkness--and {{in the midst}} of them a tender woman thrust out from her husband's home in her thin night-dress, the harsh wind cutting her naked feet, and driving her long <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her half-clad bosom, where the poor heart is crushed with anguish and despair.|$|E
60|$|After an {{impatient}} oath or two, and some stupid clawing of {{herself with the}} hand not necessary to her support, she got her <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her eyes sufficiently to obtain a sight of him. Then she sat swaying her body to and fro, and making gestures with her unnerved arm, which seemed intended as the accompaniment to a fit of laughter, though her face was stolid and drowsy.|$|E
6000|$|My wounds {{broke out}} afresh at this intelligence. I left the scarcely-tasted breakfast, and went and rested {{my head on}} another table, {{in a corner of}} the little room, which Minnie hastily cleared, lest I should spot the {{mourning}} that was lying there with my tears. She was a pretty, good-natured girl, and put my <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> my eyes with a soft, kind touch; but she was very cheerful at having nearly finished her work and being in good time, and was so different from me! ...|$|E
2500|$|The bow is {{held with}} an underhand grip. The bow hair is {{adjusted}} {{so it is}} slightly loose. The fingers of the right hand are used to push the <b>hairs</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the stick {{in order to create}} tension in the hairs. The bow hair is placed in between the two strings and both sides of the bow hair are used to produce sound, the player pushes the bow <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the body when bowing the A string (the outside string), and pulls it inwards when bowing the [...] "inside" [...] Dstring.|$|R
6000|$|... "With {{that head}} of <b>hair!</b> Keep <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the women! And a Maloney! Hasn't {{he got a}} license? But, {{nonsense}} aside, {{what do you think}} of the prospects? It's a species of filibustering out of my line." ...|$|R
60|$|It had all {{happened}} so suddenly that no one--least of all Licinia--could guess {{what it was}} that had so angered my lady. Dea Flavia had raised herself to a sitting posture, and thrown her <b>hair</b> back, <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her face which looked flushed and wrathful, whilst two sharp furrows appeared between her brows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely not, if I {{have made}} up my mind at last, that I never will willingly see Miss Tringle again." [...] Here he got up, and walking across the rug, stood over her, and waited as though expecting some word from her. But she, putting her two hands up to her head, and {{brushing}} her <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her forehead, looked up to him for what further words might come to him. [...] "Surely not," [...] he continued, [...] "if I {{have made up}} my mind at last, that nothing shall ever again serve to rob me of your love,--if I may still hope to possess it." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{might have}} been a dream, {{originating}} in the fancy which had occupied my mind so long, but I awoke with the impression that my aunt had come and bent over me, and had put my <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> my face, and laid my head more comfortably, and had then stood looking at me. The words, 'Pretty fellow,' or 'Poor fellow,' seemed to be in my ears, too; but certainly there was nothing else, when I awoke, to lead me to believe that they had been uttered by my aunt, who sat in the bow-window gazing at the sea from behind the green fan, which was mounted on a kind of swivel, and turned any way.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear!" [...] {{with the}} {{lingering}} utterance which affection gives to the word. Rosamond too {{was still under}} the power of that same past, and her husband was still in part the Lydgate whose approval had stirred delight. She put his <b>hair</b> lightly <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his forehead, then laid her other hand on his, and was conscious of forgiving him.|$|R
50|$|Hair relaxing, or lanthionization, colloquially {{known as}} a perm, can be {{performed}} by a professional cosmetologist in a salon, a professional barber in a barbershop or at home with relaxer kits. As with hair dye, the treated portion of the <b>hair</b> moves <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the scalp as the new growth of untreated hair sprouts up from the roots, requiring periodic retreatment (about every 8-10 weeks) to maintain a consistent appearance.|$|R
40|$|Intelligent Design is the {{successor}} to old-fashioned creationism but dressed in a new coat—its hair cut, its beard trimmed, and its clock set back 10 or 15 billion years. It is nevertheless a <b>hair’s</b> breadth <b>away</b> <b>from</b> creationism in its insistence that everyone is wrong but its proponents, that science is too rigid to accept what is obvious, that intelligent-design advocates {{are the victims of}} a massive conspiracy t...|$|R
50|$|An Alice band (the {{technical}} {{term for a}} hair band) is either a flexible horse-shoe shaped garment or a loop of elastic material {{which is designed to}} fit over the head and hold long <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the face, but let it hang freely at the back.|$|E
50|$|The Alice band {{is said to}} have {{originated}} in the period around 1865, following the publication of Lewis Carroll's novels Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. In these novels Alice is sometimes shown wearing a ribbon to keep her long <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her face.|$|E
50|$|Stoner {{served as}} {{animation}} reference model for Ariel in Disney's The Little Mermaid and for Belle in Beauty and the Beast. Ariel frequently bites her lower lip, and Belle often brushes <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her face. Both {{of these are}} mannerisms of Stoner's that animators adapted to the characters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Venerable mother!" [...] he began, [...] "the blessed Jesus {{commands}} {{you to give}} up the Anathema {{which you}} carry upon you. That cap embroidered with pearls, those jewels that fasten up your false hair--let them be given up and sold for the poor; and cast the <b>hair</b> itself <b>away</b> <b>from</b> you, as a lie that is only fit for burning. Doubtless, too, you have other jewels under your silk mantle." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he closed}} the door behind her. The room in which Marguerite now found herself was a small unventilated quadrangle, dimly lighted by a hanging lamp. A woman in a soiled cotton gown and lank grey <b>hair</b> brushed <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a parchment-like {{forehead}} rose from the chair in which she had been sitting when Marguerite entered, and put away some knitting on which she had apparently been engaged.|$|R
50|$|She {{would often}} grow {{her hair and}} dye it blonde, red or even pink. For {{the last few years}} she has sported very short blonde <b>hair</b> and moved <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{modeling}} but occasionally has had her head shaved in recent years.|$|R
50|$|Dark-brown trousers, a light-brown shirt, {{and black}} oxford-style shoes for boys. For girls, a white shalwar, light-brown qamez, a white scarf (or white with a dark-brown border). Boys wear their hair short and girls tie their <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> their faces. Students wear the school badge. Socks or {{stockings}} are white.|$|E
5000|$|A {{headband}} is {{a clothing}} accessory worn {{in the hair}} or around the forehead, usually to hold <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the face or eyes. Headbands generally consist of a loop of elastic material or a horseshoe-shaped piece of flexible plastic or metal. They come in assorted shapes and sizes and are used for both practical and fashion purposes.|$|E
5000|$|A hair tie, {{also known}} by the names listed below, is an item used to fasten hair, {{particularly}} long <b>hair,</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{areas such as the}} face. This is usually done as part of a hairstyle such as pigtails, bunches, ponytail for straight, wavy and loosely curled hair and referred to as afro puffs, bunny tails and [...] "pineapples" [...] for highly curled and highly textured natural hair. Two common types of hair ties are the scrunchie and the hairpin.|$|E
5000|$|Continuous Level {{of detail}} (LOD) is {{designed}} to improve performance by dynamically adjusting visual detail as TressFX-enabled objects move towards and <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the player’s point of view. This is done by rendering fewer <b>hairs</b> when far <b>away</b> <b>from</b> an object but making each hair thicker, thus reducing computational time but maintaining the same look and aesthetic.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "Youth" by Veith, depicting {{the profile of a}} young girl, [s. d. ]. The girl is shown from the shoulders up, her <b>hair</b> bound <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her shoulders and neck by a florally-decorated cap or kerchief. Her hair is dark and curly and can be seen peeking out from under the kerchief. Just a hint of her dress is visible below her shoulders. The background is rendered with little shading, and suggests flowers, echoing the business of the kerchief's design...|$|R
2500|$|Workman put an {{advertisement}} {{in a local}} newspaper back in Missouri. He wrote that he would give a one cent reward to anyone who brought the boy back to Franklin. No one claimed the reward. It {{was a bit of}} a joke, but Carson was free. The advertisement featured the first printed description of Carson: [...] "Christopher Carson, a boy about 16 years old, small of his age, but thick set; light <b>hair,</b> ran <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the subscriber, living in Franklin, Howard county, Missouri, to whom he had been bound to learn the saddler's trade." ...|$|R
5000|$|Afro, {{sometimes}} {{abbreviated to}} fro and {{also known as}} a [...] "natural", is a hairstyle worn naturally outward by people with lengthy kinky hair texture or specifically styled in such a fashion by individuals with naturally curly or straight hair. The hairstyle is created by combing the <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the scalp, allowing the hair to extend out from the head in a large, rounded shape, much like a cloud or ball. In people with naturally curly or straight hair, the hairstyle is instead typically created with the help of creams, gels or other solidifying liquids to hold the hair in place. Particularly popular in the African-American community of the late 1960s, the hairstyle is often shaped and maintained with the assistance of a wide-toothed comb colloquially known as an Afro pick.|$|E
5000|$|The bow is held underhand (palm up), {{similar to}} a German double bass bow grip, but away from the frog towards the balance point. The stick's {{curvature}} is generally convex as were violin bows of the period, rather than concave like a modern violin bow. The [...] "frog" [...] (which holds the bowhair and adjusts its tension) is also {{different from that of}} modern bows: whereas a violin bow frog has a [...] "slide" [...] (often made of mother of pearl), which pinches the hair and holds it flat and stationary across the frog, viol bows have an open frog that allows more movement of the hair. This facilitates a traditional playing technique where the performer uses one or two fingers of the bow hand to press the <b>hair</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the bow stick. This dynamically increases bow hair tension to control articulation and inflection.|$|E

60|$|In {{the midst}} of all the litter de Batz at last became {{conscious}} of two people who stood staring at him and at Heron. He saw a man before him, somewhat fleshy of build, with smooth, mouse-coloured <b>hair</b> brushed <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a central parting, and ending in a heavy curl above each ear; the eyes were wide open and pale in colour, the lips unusually thick and with a marked downward droop. Close beside him stood a youngish-looking woman, whose unwieldy bulk, however, and pallid skin revealed the sedentary life and the ravages of ill-health.|$|R
60|$|Two {{young ladies}} {{appeared}} before me; one very tall, almost {{as tall as}} Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien. There was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen collar, <b>hair</b> combed <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the temples, and the nun-like ornament {{of a string of}} ebony beads and a crucifix. This I felt sure was Eliza, though I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and colourless visage.|$|R
5000|$|For a {{long time}} {{there has been no}} doubt in anyone's mind as to the name of the artist; but the {{identity}} of the sitter remains a mystery. The portrait represents a very young woman, hardly more than a girl. Against the background of greenery, with its sprinkling of butterflies, pinks and columbines, the profile is sharply defined. Her hair is styled to create the appearance of a high, round forehead, an attribute of beauty in Renaissance Italy. Women of this era frequently plucked their eyebrows, hairlines, and drew <b>hair</b> tightly <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the face to accentuate this quality.|$|R
