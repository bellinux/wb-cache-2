The {{rest of the family}} awakens and flee to Peter's self-built panic room and begin to monitor what the robbers are doing through hidden cameras.

Katy warns Shell not to break anything, and is startled to see the now-live cat. Katy tries to call her father so she can leave, but the house has no mobile phone signal and the house phone's party line is tied up. As she prepares to leave, the stairlift returns <b>downstairs</b> <b>and</b> Andras's bell rings. Katy is scared of going upstairs, but, at Shell's insistence, the two go to check on him.|$|E

5|$|Enraged by the deception, Fionna {{takes out}} the crystal sword to fight. The sword {{turns out to be}} another one of Ice Queen’s tricks and turns into a ball of ice around Fionna’s hands. Cake hears noises from <b>downstairs</b> <b>and</b> senses Fionna is in trouble. Undaunted, Fionna uses the ice to beat Ice Queen over the head. Ice Queen pushes her off with a burst of snow which allows Fionna to get close to enough to break Prince Gumball free and knock out the Ice Queen with a broken icicle. Cake bursts in and sees Gumball {{standing}} next to Fionna in her torn dress; she jumps to the wrong conclusion and lunges at him but Fionna stops Cake and tells her it was the Ice Queen all along. Just then Ice Queen recovers and blasts Cake away from Fionna only to have Fionna knock her magic tiara off which negates her powers. The real Gumball asks Fionna on a date and is turned down; Fionna notes that she does not need a boyfriend at the moment.|$|E

25|$|Satō's mother lived <b>downstairs</b> <b>and</b> {{apparently}} had {{no contact with}} her son's captive since he became very violent whenever she tried to go upstairs. However, police believe the mother must have had some knowledge of Ms. Sano's presence; for example, it was alleged that she purchased feminine hygiene products for the victim.|$|E
25|$|The outdoor, indoor (<b>downstairs)</b> <b>and</b> {{basement}} {{scenes were}} filmed {{at a location}} northeast of Evans City, near a park. The basement door (external view) shown in the film was cut into a wall by the production team and led nowhere. As this house was scheduled for demolition, damage during filming was permitted. The site is now a turf farm.|$|E

25|$|The Library, {{named after}} college trustee Robert E. Nicholas, opened in January 1952. In 1975 Buswell Memorial Library, {{named for the}} college's third {{president}} J.

The building also contains the Peter Stam Music Library, located <b>downstairs</b> <b>and</b> {{named in honor of}} the Conservatory of Music's first head, Peter Stam.|$|E
25|$|The village pub {{is called}} 'The Red Lion'. Records of this inn {{date back to}} the early 19th century, when the publican was also a farmer, but it is {{probably}} older than that. It closed in July 2010 and re-opened in October 2011, following a complete refubishment. As well as a bar, there is a 150-seat restaurant with a <b>downstairs</b> <b>and</b> an upstairs dining area, which has a terrace providing views over the Ely valley and beyond.|$|E
25|$|Inside, a key {{aspect of}} the crime scene was also {{inconsistent}} with the burglary theory. At {{the top of the stairs}} was a stack of stereo equipment atop a VCR. If, as the evidence suggested, the struggle between Rasmussen and her attacker had begun upstairs and then continued downstairs, that stack would likely have been knocked <b>downstairs</b> <b>and</b> scattered as well. It made more sense to assume that it had been stacked afterwards, when an actual burglar would have fled the scene immediately after the shooting.|$|E

25|$|Germantown did {{not have}} a public school until {{after the end of the}} American Civil War. During that time, {{education}} was handled at home. In 1868, a one-room schoolhouse was built on Maryland Route 118, near Black Rock Road, which hosted children from both Germantown and neighboring Darnestown. In 1883, a larger one-room schoolhouse was built closer to Clopper Road. Another, newer school was constructed in 1910, on what is now the site of Germantown Elementary School. This school had four rooms, with two <b>downstairs</b> <b>and</b> two upstairs, with each room housing two grade levels. After the eighth grade, the students would head via train to nearby Rockville, for further education.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, KTVU {{obtained}} the local broadcast {{rights to the}} Warner Bros. Pictures library; the films it broadcast from the studio primarily consisted of those released during the 1950s, most being presented in color, which aired at 7:00p.m. on Sundays. Channel 2 was the first television station in the Bay Area to air such films as A Star Is Born, East of Eden and Rebel Without a Cause. KTVU exercised discretion and limited the amount of commercial break interruptions during the movie telecasts, often airing the films uncensored and with commentary, either by a studio host or via slides. The station even televised the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film Hollywood Revue of 1929 {{with some of the}} original two-strip Technicolor sequences. During the early 1970s, the station began employing a different programming strategy to stand out from the other independents in the market, acquiring first-run syndicated sitcoms and drama series, several comedies and dramas from the United Kingdom (such as Upstairs, <b>Downstairs</b> <b>and</b> The Benny Hill Show, the latter of which had some episodes re-edited by the station to remove scenes of frontal nudity accidentally left in the broadcast prints), and various nature series (including National Geographic specials) as alternative offerings.|$|E
