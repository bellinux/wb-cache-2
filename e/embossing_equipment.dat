40|$|A {{continuous}} hot embossing {{method is}} {{reported in this}} paper. The continuous means that the extruder and the hot <b>embossing</b> <b>equipment</b> is used in series, the polymer film is embossed after extrusion immediately. The basic principle of this method, the key design point and the corresponding operate process of the <b>embossing</b> <b>equipment</b> is described in this paper. The polymer diffuser with micro-lens matrix on its surface is designed and the optical properties are simulated. Then, the diffuser is fabricated by the <b>embossing</b> <b>equipment.</b> The optical properties of the diffuser are tested and compared {{with the results of}} the simulation to verify the reproducibility of the equipment. By this method, the diffuser with large area can be fabricated with high precision of graphic replication, high efficiency and low cost...|$|E
40|$|Metals and Glass {{are widely}} used {{materials}} in several fields of application in microsystems technology. Also in medical applications for analysis and in information technology for optical applications these materials are of interest. For a broader use also in miniaturized systems the availability of microstructure replication technology is necessary. In the paper the possibility of embossing fluoride glass with high accuracy in glass sheets is shown. Microfluidic structures and also support structures for light wave guides were made by embossing. Also the embossing of aluminium alloys with small structures is possible and will be shown. These results were achieved with an <b>embossing</b> <b>equipment</b> for wafer diameter of 50 mm. Dedicated to this embossing technology an newly machine system was developed. This <b>embossing</b> <b>equipment</b> allows the hot embossing of sheets up to an diameter of 100 mm and up to temperatures of 700 Â° C...|$|E
40|$|A displacement-induced {{crime wave}} model assumes that changes m crime {{opportunities}} will motivate a significant subset of offenders {{to engage in}} similar crime switching adaptations, expectation being that the crime wave will therefore {{be associated with a}} concomitant decrease in other related offences. This paper locates a particular crime wave (a 1992 - 94 wave in counterfeit credit card frauds), identifies a set of related offences (stolen-based credit card frauds) and argues that the expected displacement effect triggered by the marketing of compact and efficient encoding and <b>embossing</b> <b>equipment</b> (as well as sophisticated photocopying and printing devices) did not materialize, in practice, at least in the setting we have analysed (Montreal). Even though stolen-based and altered credit card frauds were tightly related offences and involved a homoge-neous population of offenders, the actual difference in pay-off was not significant enough to trigger systematic switching in crime tactic preferences; moreover, offenders willing to participate in sophisticated 'pure ' counterfeit credit card frauds could not, as a matter of fact, take advantage of such an option even if they wished to do so (mainly because they did not have the right (ethnic) connections). Crime waves usually refer to sudden and significant increases in crime rates. Such collective spurts vary in magnitude, duration and return levels. Some of these crime waves are produced by crime displacement effects, 1 die topic of this paper. We start by identifying a specific crime wave, namely the sudden increase in Canada in die numbe...|$|E
40|$|Research work aims {{to develop}} a fast, {{production}} suitable hot embossing technology including appropriate tool systems for low-cost and production-integrated manufacturing of high-precision microfluidic structures in polymer films. The implementation is demonstrated by structuring of microfluidic films for disposable diagnostic devices used in home-care and point-of-care applications. The approach focuses on the development and thermal design of a tool system for fast hot embossing on basis of a fast non isothermal process. Close contour tempering of the active parts {{is the core of}} this approach. Based on an industrial specification the paper will describe tempering strategy, design and simulation of the tool concept. Heat flux and heat capacities together with the power loss in the system are used for calculating the tempering cycle. Based on that, the setup of an optimized tool system consisting of heating elements and a refrigerant system is presented. The new tool concept is thermally characterized by thermocouple and infrared measurements. Furthermore the system was tested in a commercial hot <b>embossing</b> <b>equipment</b> to demonstrate the improvements. It could be shown that a cycle time between one and two minutes is possible, in comparison to cycle times of fifteen minutes in conventional hot embossing systems. Although the test system was not optimized so far, in the embossing tests all items were replicated correctly and the microfluidic function was ensured. The results of the research work are applicable also for the optimization of injection molding tool systems...|$|E
