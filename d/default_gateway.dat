2500|$|To allow a 6to4 host to {{communicate}} with the native IPv6 Internet, it must have its IPv6 <b>default</b> <b>gateway</b> set to a 6to4 address which contains the IPv4 address of a 6to4 relay router. To avoid the need for users to set this up manually, the anycast address of 192.88.99.1 has been allocated for the purpose of sending packets to a 6to4 relay router. Note that when wrapped in 6to4 with the subnet and hosts fields set to zero this IPv4 address (192.88.99.1) [...] becomes the IPv6 address 2002:c058:6301::. To ensure BGP routing propagation, a short prefix of 192.88.99.0/24 has been allocated for routes pointed at 6to4 relay routers that use this anycast IP address. Providers willing to provide 6to4 service to their clients or peers should advertise the anycast prefix like any other IP prefix, and route the prefix to their 6to4 relay.|$|E

If there was no such restriction, simultaneous creation of PCP mappings would be required on all network gateways, which might not be consistently doable; for example, on one of the <b>default</b> <b>gateways</b> the required external port might be already taken by another application's mapping.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, a DDoS defense {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} to deploy in routers serv-ing as the <b>default</b> <b>gateways</b> of sub-networks. Each router is configured with {{the set of}} IP addresses belonging to monitored sub-networks. By monitoring two-way connections between the policed set of IP addresses {{and the rest of}} the Internet, our approach can effectively identify malicious network flows consti-tuting DDoS attacks, and consequently restrict attack traffics with rate-limiting techniques. Current source-end DDoS defense scheme cannot accurately distin-guish between network congestion caused by a DDoS attack and that caused by regular events. Under some circumstances, both false positive and false nega-tive can be high, and this reduces the effectiveness of the defense mechanism. To improve the effectiveness, new DDoS detection algorithms are presented in this paper to complement, rather than replace existing source-end DDoS defense COMPUTER SECURITY IN THE 21 CENTURY systems. The design of the proposed detection algorithm is based on three es-sential characteristics of DDoS attacks: distribution, congestion, and continuity. With the three characteristics, the proposed detection algorithm significantly im-proves detection accuracy, and at the same time reduces both false positive and false negative against DDoS attacks...|$|R
50|$|The Multicast MAnet Routing Protocol (MMARP) aims {{to provide}} {{multicast}} routing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) {{taking into account}} interoperation with fixed IP networks with support of IGMP/MLD protocol. This is achieved by the Multicast Internet Gateway (MIG) which is an ad hoc node itself and is responsible for notifying access routers about the interest revealed by common ad hoc nodes. Any of these nodes may become a MIG at any time but needs to be one hop away from the network access router. Once it self-configures as MIG it should then broadcast periodically its address as being {{the one of the}} <b>default</b> multicast <b>gateway.</b> Whoever besides this proactive advertisement the protocol states a reactive component the ad hoc mesh is created and maintained.|$|R
40|$|Wireless ad hoc {{networks}} {{are connected to}} the fixed Internet by means of Internet gateways. Whenever a node within the ad hoc network wishes to communicate with a host in the Internet, it selects a <b>default</b> Internet <b>gateway</b> to relay its traffic from the ad hoc network to the Internet. In this paper, we formulate the problem of selecting the best Internet gateway as a mixed Integer linear program minimizing the maximum node utilization in the wireless network. By simulations, we show that the performance that can be achieved by solving this optimization problem is significantly higher than what is achieved by standard gateway selection algorithms based on hop count or gateway load. In particular, these heuristic algorithms fail to adapt to the offered traffic and available capacity in the network...|$|R

50|$|A <b>default</b> <b>gateway</b> in {{computer}} networking is the node that {{is assumed to}} know how to forward packets on to other networks. Typically, in a TCP/IP network, nodes such as servers, workstations and network devices each have a defined default route setting, (pointing to the <b>default</b> <b>gateway),</b> defining where to send packets for IP addresses for which they can determine no specific route. The gateway is by definition a router.|$|E

50|$|Accessing {{internal}} resourcesIf PC2 (172.16.1.100) {{needs to}} access PC3 (192.168.1.100), since PC2 has no route to 192.168.1.100 it will send packets for PC3 to its <b>default</b> <b>gateway</b> (router2). Router2 also has no route to PC3, {{and it will}} forward the packets to its <b>default</b> <b>gateway</b> (router1). Router1 has a route for this network (192.168.1.0/24) so router1 will forward the packets to router3, which will deliver the packets to PC3; reply packets will follow the same route to PC2.|$|E
50|$|A packet {{addressed}} {{outside of}} this range, for this example, addressed to 192.168.12.3, cannot travel directly to the destination. Instead it must {{be sent to the}} <b>default</b> <b>gateway</b> for further routing to their ultimate destination. In this example, the <b>default</b> <b>gateway</b> uses the IP address 192.168.4.1, which is resolved into a MAC address with ARP in the usual way. The destination IP address remains 192.168.12.3, but the next-hop physical address is that of the gateway, rather than of the ultimate destination.|$|E
