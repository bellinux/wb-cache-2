To do this, the network self-organizes a mapping from motion directions in 3 -D space to velocity commands in joint space. Computer simulations demonstrate that, without any additional learning, the network can generate accurate movement commands that compensate for variable tool lengths, clamping of joints, distortions of visual <b>input</b> by a <b>prism,</b> and unexpected limb perturbations.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{real-time}} {{distributed applications}} exhibit probabilistic and non-deterministic behaviors. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic Timed Rebeca (PTRebeca) as an actor-based language for modeling probabilistic distributed real-time systems with asynchronous message passing. We pro-pose the semantics of PTRebeca model in Timed Markov Decision Process (TMDP), the integral semantics of probabilistic timed automaton (PTA) with one digital clock. To analyze PTRebeca models, we develop a tool set to au-tomatically generate a TMDP model from a PTRebeca {{model in the}} form of the <b>input</b> language of <b>PRISM</b> model checker. We use PRISM for performance analysis of PTRebeca models against expected reachability and probabilistic reachability properties.

40|$|A carrier {{structure}} {{made from}} a single silicon substrate {{is the basis of}} a compact, lightweight, relatively inexpensive package that holds the main optical/electronic coupling components of a photonic millimeter-wave receiver based on a lithium niobate resonator disk. The design of the package is simple and provides for precise relative placement of optical components, eliminating the need for complex, bulky positioning mechanisms like those commonly used to align optical components to optimize focus and coupling. Although a prototype of the package was fabricated as a discrete unit, the design is amenable to integration of the package into a larger photonic and/or electronic receiver system. The components (see figure) include a lithium niobate optical resonator disk of 5 -mm diameter and. 200 - m thickness, positioned adjacent to a millimeter- wave resonator electrode. Other components include input and output coupling <b>prisms</b> and <b>input</b> and output optical fibers tipped with ball lenses for focusing and collimation, respectively. Laser light is introduced via the input optical fiber and focused into the <b>input</b> coupling <b>prism.</b> The <b>input</b> coupling <b>prism</b> is positioned near (but not in contact with) the resonator disk so that by means of evanescent-wave coupling, the input laser light in the prism gives rise to laser light propagating circumferentially in guided modes in the resonator disk. Similarly, a portion of the circumferentially propagating optical power is extracted from the disk by evanescent-wave coupling from the disk to the output coupling prism, from whence the light passes through the collimating ball lens into the output optical fiber. The lens-tipped optical fibers must be positioned at a specified focal distance from the prisms. The optical fibers and the prisms must be correctly positioned relative to the resonator disk and must be oriented to obtain the angle of incidence (55 in the prototype) required for evanescent-wave coupling of light {{into and out of the}} desired guided modes in the resonator disk. To satisfy all these requirements, precise alignment features are formed in the silicon substrate by use of a conventional wet-etching process. These features include a 5 -mm-diameter, 50 - m-deep cavity that holds the disk; two trapezoidal-cross-section recesses for the prisms; and two grooves that hold the optical fibers at the correct positions and angles relative to the prisms and disk. The fiber grooves contain abrupt tapers, near the prisms, that serve as hard stops for positioning the lenses at the focal distance from the prisms. There are also two grooves for prismadjusting rods. The design provides a little slack in the prism recesses for adjusting the positions of the prisms by means of these rods to optimize the optical coupling...|$|R
30|$|Potential {{evapotranspiration}} (PET) {{has been}} proven useful as an index of the “drying power” of ambient meteorological conditions (Dingman 2001). A temperature based, 1971 – 2000 normals PET grid was constructed using an equation created by Hamon (1963, equation 3). Spatial precipitation and temperature data {{were obtained from the}} Spatial Climate Analysis Service as ASCII text files and were converted to grids. The GIS product was a summation of monthly PET values as one 30 m 2 spatial grid. The climatic spatial data sets used in this study were created by a Parameter Elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) (Daly 2004). Using a dynamic search radius for <b>input</b> weather stations <b>PRISM</b> computes spatial data sets by incorporating into calculation adiabatic lapse rates, orrographic effects, coastal proximity and other environmental factors.|$|R
40|$|Non-functional {{requirements}} like {{performance and}} reliability play {{a prominent role}} in distributed and dynamic systems. To measure and predict such properties using stochastic formal methods is crucial. At the same time, graph transformation systems are a suitable formalism to formally model distributed and dynamic systems. Already, to address these two issues, Stochastic Graph Transformation Systems (SGTS) have been introduced to model dynamic distributed systems. But most of the researches so far are concentrated on SGTS as a modeling means without considering the need for suitable analysis tools. In this paper, we present an approach to verify this kind of graph transformation systems using PRISM (a stochastic model checker). We translate the SGTS to the <b>input</b> language of <b>PRISM</b> and then PRISM performs the model checking and returns the results back to the designers...|$|R

After briefly reviewing the various parameters that {{one needs to}} consider for proper baseline model development, this paper illustrates the differences in energy savings one would obtain by direct utility bill comparison as against weather normalizing. Next, PRISM (PRInceton Scorekeeping Method), a widely used methodology and software for determining retrofit savings, is presented and discussed. The importance of assuring proper data quality is highlighted and its adverse effects on the baseline model is illustrated with data from two College Station homes. Finally, this paper presents preliminary problems encountered while preparing <b>input</b> data for <b>PRISM</b> runs for 462 houses in 59 Texas cities under WAP.

40|$|An {{optical system}} is {{described}} for rotating the plane {{defined by a}} pair of parallel light beams. In one embodiment a single pair of rhomboid prisms have their respective input faces disposed to receive the respective <b>input</b> beams. Each <b>prism</b> is rotated about an axis of revolution coaxial with each of the respective input beams by means of a suitable motor and gear arrangement to cause the plane of the parallel output beams to be rotated relative to the plane of the input beams. In a second embodiment, two pairs of rhomboid prisms are provided. In a first angular orientation of the output beams, the prisms merely decrease the lateral displacement of the output beams in order to keep in the same plane as the input beams. In a second angular orientation of the <b>prisms,</b> the <b>input</b> faces of the second pair of prisms are brought into coincidence with the input beams for rotating the plane of the output beams by a substantial angle such as 90 deg...|$|R
40|$|The {{rigorous}} {{descriptions of}} linear and nonlinear guided wave theory are given {{together with a}} geometrical description that helps {{in the understanding of}} the physical phenomena taking place. The nonlinear waveguide discussed in this dissertation is composed of a linear thin film and substrate with a cladding material whose refractive index varies with the intensity of the light. Experimentally, this was accomplished, by placing an oriented liquid crystal (highly nonlinear but extremely slow) on top of a thin film glass waveguide. When the liquid crystal used was K 15, light-induced mode cutoff was observed. The TE(, 0) mode became leaky as the guided wave power was increased. This was a consequence of the light-induced increase in refractive index due to thermal effects. This behaviour was studied as a function of temperature. Light by light modulation was also accomplished with this setup. The theory of the linear and nonlinear prism coupler and the first experimental investigations on the nonlinear prism coupler are given. The nonlinear prism coupler used was obtained by depositing a small amount of MBBA liquid crystal in the gap beween the <b>input</b> coupling <b>prism</b> and the thin film. The basic properties of the nonlinear prism coupler were demonstrated experimentally and the results obtained were verified to have their origin in the temperature component of the nonlinear index of refraction. Good qualitative agreement between the theory developed and experiments were obtained. Bistability and switching in a thin film waveguide with a K 18 liquid crystal cladding has been demonstrated for the first time. These experiments made use of the interesting phenomena associated with the nematic to isotropic phase transition. Such behaviour was satisfactorily explained by the intense light scattering associated with the critical opalescence that accompanies such a phase transition in a liquid crystal. Both the TE(, 0) and the TM(, 0) modes were found to exhibit such behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Using probabilities in the formal-methods-based {{development}} of safety-critical software has quickened interests in academia and industry. We address this area by our model-driven engineering method for reactive systems SPACE and its tool-set Reactive Blocks that provide an extension {{to support the}} modeling and verification of real-time behaviors. The approach facilitates the composition of system models from reusable building blocks {{as well as the}} verification of functional and real-time properties and the automatic generation of Java code. In this paper, we describe the extension of the tool-set to enable the modeling and verification of probabilistic real-time system behavior with the focus on spatial properties that ensure system safety. In particular, we incorporate descriptions of probabilistic behavior into our Reactive Blocks models and integrate the model checker PRISM which allows to verify that a real-time system satis- fies certain safety properties with a given probability. Moreover, we consider the spatial implication of probabilistic system specifications by integrating the spatial verification tool BeSpaceD and give an automatic approach to translate system specifications to the <b>input</b> languages of <b>PRISM</b> and BeSpaceD.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we address}} the issue of model-based {{verification}} and validation of systems engineering design models expressed using UML/SysML. The main objectives are to assess the design from its structural and behavioral perspectives and to enable a qualitative as well as a quantitative appraisal of its conformance with respect to its requirements and a set of desired properties. To this end, we elaborate a heretofore unattempted unified approach composed of three well-established techniques that are model-checking, static analysis, and software engineering metrics. These techniques are synergistically combined so that they yield a comprehensive and enhanced assessment. Furthermore, we propose to extend this approach with performance analysis and probabilistic assessment of SysML activity diagrams. Thus, we devise an algorithm that systematically maps these diagrams into their corresponding probabilistic models encoded using the specification language of the probabilistic symbolic model-checker PRISM. Moreover, we define a first of its kind probabilistic calculus, namely activity calculus, dedicated to capture the essence of SysML activity diagrams and its underlying operational semantics in terms of Markov decision processes. Furthermore, we propose a formal syntax and operational semantics for the <b>input</b> language of <b>PRISM.</b> Finally, we mathematically prove the soundness of our translation algorithm with respect to the devised operational semantics using a simulation preorder defined upon Markov decision processes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a self-organizing neural model for eye-hand coordination. Called the DIRECT model, it embodies {{a solution of}} the classical motor equivalence problem. Motor equivalence computations allow humans and other animals to flexibly employ an arm with more degrees of freedom than the space in which it moves to carry out spatially defined tasks under conditions that may require novel joint configurations. During a motor babbling phase, the model endogenously generates movement commands that activate the correlated visual, spatial, and motor information {{that are used to}} learn its internal coordinate transformations. After learning occurs, the model is capable of controlling reaching movements of the arm to prescribed spatial targets using many different combinations of joints. When allowed visual feedback, the model can automatically perform, without additional learning, reaches with tools of variable lengths, with clamped joints, with distortions of visual <b>input</b> by a <b>prism,</b> and with unexpected perturbations. These compensatory computations occur within a single accurate reaching movement. No corrective movements are needed. Blind reaches using internal feedback have also been simulated. The model achieves its competence by transforming visual information about target position and end effector position in 3 -D space into a body-centered spatial representation of the direction in 3 -D space that the end effector must move to contact the target. The spatial direction vector is adaptively transformed into a motor direction vector, which represents the joint rotations that move the end effector in the desired spatial direction from the present arm configuration. Properties of the model are compared with psychophysical data on human reaching movements, neurophysiological data on the tuning curves of neurons in the monkey motor cortex, and alternative models of movement control.
