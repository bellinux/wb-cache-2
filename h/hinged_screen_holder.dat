Here a paradigm is not a particular solution, but rather the underlying system of ideas that causes a range of solutions to be 'normal' or 'obvious'. A current example is the laptop: as of 2010 the design paradigm of laptops includes a portable computer unit consisting of a QWERTY keyboard, a <b>hinged</b> <b>screen,</b> etc. Moreover, such device {{is assumed to be}} helpful in task such as education as in the One Laptop per Child project.|$|R

5000|$|The {{surprise}} is a <b>hinged,</b> folding <b>screen</b> of five oval miniature portraits {{of women from}} the House of Romanov, each wearing the uniform of the Red Cross. The miniatures were possibly painted by Vasily Ivanovich Zuiev (active with Faberge from 1903 - 1918). The portraits are of the Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, Nicholas II's sister, Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia, his eldest daughter, Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia, the Tsar's second daughter, and the Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, the Tsar's first cousin.|$|R

There was an unnoticeable buzz that you could hear if you turned on the backlight and placed the Palm next to your ear. This was due to the power regulator sending lots of power to the screen to power the backlight. Therefore, this caused the battery to drain faster than normal.|$|R

50|$|The Veterinary School {{building}} interior has sheeting and batten cover strips lining its ceilings in a geometric pattern. The ceiling ventilation panels {{have all}} been sheeted over. Walls are rendered, and floors are finished with carpet, vinyl, or sealed concrete coved to the walls. There are dark-stained and clear-finished timber skirtings, cornices, picture rails, and architraves in most rooms. Room names are painted on timber panels and fixed above doorways. The timber doors match the other timberwork in the building with circular, glass observation panels, or panels with bolection moulding. Most retain original brass hardware and some the original auto-closers. Windows are timber-framed double-hung sashes or timber-framed fixed panes; {{many of which have}} external, <b>hinged,</b> timber-framed <b>screens</b> and retain original brass hardware.|$|R

A convertible tablet PC's <b>screen</b> <b>hinge</b> often must rotate around two axes, unlike a normal laptop screen, subsequently increasing the number of possible mechanical and electrical (digitizer and video cables, embedded Wi-Fi antennas, etc.) failure points.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on eight subjects, in order to investigate the influence of head posture {{with regards to the}} <b>screen</b> and copy <b>holder</b> position, the activity of cervical muscles and the subjective judgement given by the subjects. A total of eleven different positions (exercises) of <b>screen</b> and copy <b>holder</b> were investigated. Four different screen positions were examined in the upright (middle) sitting posture and three different screen positions were investigated in the backward sitting posture. In addition, four different positions of the copy holder were examined in the upright sitting posture. Head posture and muscle activity were continuously measured in each exercise for a duration of 5 min. At the end of each exercise, the subjects were asked how they judged the position of the screen and/or the copy holder in comparison with other positions. The results show that preference is to be given to a screen position in which the vision axis is horizontal or inclined slightly downwards. The copy holder should be arranged at one side of the screen...|$|R

2500|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the grain ship and tanker MACs was the provision of hangar space within the grain ships. [...] The three after holds were converted to provide a hangar [...] long, [...] wide to a height of [...] in which the ship's full complement of four Swordfish aircraft could be stowed with wings folded. [...] An elevator platform could lift a fully loaded aircraft from hangar to deck level in less than a minute. [...] It was impracticable to fit tanker MACs with a hangar as this would have entailed very extensive structural alterations and a significant reduction in cargo capacity. [...] Although capable of operating four aircraft, tanker MACs normally embarked three, which all had to be kept on deck: [...] parked aircraft had to be moved to the forward end when other aircraft were landing on, and a collapsible safety barrier was fitted to prevent collisions. [...] <b>Hinged</b> side <b>screens</b> or 'palisades' were fitted around the aft end of the flight deck to provide weather protection for parked aircraft but with only limited effect.|$|R

It has improved battery life over the DSi on all brightness settings; for example, batteries last 13–17 hours at the dimmest setting. The handheld is outfitted with identical speakers contained in larger speaker enclosures, enabling them to produce louder sound. The <b>hinges</b> stop the <b>screen</b> at 120° {{in addition to the}} original DSi's position of 155° to allow easier table-top viewing.

2500|$|Genocidal killings {{began the}} {{following}} day. Soldiers, police, and militia quickly executed key Tutsi and moderate Hutu {{military and political}} leaders who could have assumed control in the ensuing power vacuum. Checkpoints and barricades were erected to <b>screen</b> all <b>holders</b> of the national ID card of Rwanda (which contained ethnic classification information introduced by the Belgian colonial government in 1933) in order to systematically identify and kill Tutsi. These forces recruited and pressured Hutu civilians to arm themselves with machetes, clubs, blunt objects, and other weapons to rape, maim, and kill their Tutsi neighbors and to destroy or steal their property. The breakdown of the peace accords led the RPF to restart its offensive and rapidly seize control of {{the northern part of}} the country before capturing Kigali in mid-July, bringing an end to the genocide. During these events and in the aftermath, the United Nations (UN) and countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Belgium were criticized for their inaction and failure to strengthen the force and mandate of the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) peacekeepers. Other observers criticized the government of France for alleged support of the Hutu government after the genocide had begun.|$|R
50|$|The Animal Morgue (1934) is {{situated}} {{north of the}} Stable. The morgue is a cement-rendered concrete structure, square in plan, with a timber-framed pyramid roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. A large metal ventilation fleche caps the ridge. A timber lean-to that is not significant shelters the entry doors. There are prominent stepped architraves around the exteriors of the windows. The interior walls are cement-rendered with coving to all corners. The floor is concrete, while the ceiling is white-painted cement sheet with dark- stained timber battens forming a geometric pattern. The ceiling features lattice timber ventilation panels and a skylight {{at the southern end}} made with translucent corrugated plastic sheeting. The double door is timber with multi-light glazed panels. The windows are multi-light, timber double-hung sashes and have external <b>hinged</b> timber-framed <b>screens.</b> There are small high level windows in the west wall. All glass in the building is obscured. A steel I-beam spans the width of the room from north to south. In the north-western corner is a concrete dissecting bench with drain and in the north-eastern corner is a similar bench with a ceramic sink and associated foot-operated tap. These tables drain to an integrated concrete surface gutter that runs around the western and northern edges of the floor. There is a central floor drain.|$|R
5000|$|The Reisekamera, {{meaning a}} [...] "travel camera", is a large-format wooden bellows tailboard view camera of almost {{standardised}} design, unlike the much lighter and more flexible field camera, {{but not as}} cumbersome as the studio camera. A sturdy tripod is always brought along, but it {{might just as well}} be placed on a tabletop. It has equally sized rectangular front and back panels on a full-width double-extension baseboard that is hinged near the front. The front panel, holding the lens plate, has horizontal and vertical movements, while the back is tilt-suspended on brass standards running on brass tracks {{on either side of the}} baseboard, providing rack and pinion focusing on the film plane. An almost non-tapering calico double-extension bellows is employed; allowing the projected image to freely reach the photographic plate regardless of lens offset position. The camera folds flat, after the back panel is brought forward to the lens panel, by folding the hinged base board up, and thus conveniently protecting the focusing screen. For insertion of the wooden dark slide plate cassette, the <b>hinged</b> focusing <b>screen</b> is swung up and away. The Reisekamera was made available for several plate sizes; most common are the 13×18 cm, 18×24 cm and 24×30 cm versions. Shutter and lens were normally not part of the original delivery. However, some were made available with a spectacular focal-plane shutter, recognisable by the brass mechanisms either side of the back panel.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} portability, laptops {{are subject to}} more wear and {{physical}} damage than desktops. Components such as <b>screen</b> <b>hinges,</b> latches, power jacks, and power cords deteriorate gradually from ordinary use, and {{may have to be}} replaced. A liquid spill onto the keyboard, a rather minor mishap with a desktop system (given that a basic keyboard costs about US$20), can damage the internals of a laptop and destroy the computer or result in a costly repair. One study found that a laptop is {{three times more likely to}} break during the first year of use than a desktop. To maintain a laptop, it is recommended to clean it every three months for dirt, debris, dust, and food particles. Most cleaning kits consist of a lint-free or Microfiber cloth for the LCD screen and keyboard, compressed air for getting dust out of the cooling fan, and cleaning solution. Harsh chemicals such as bleach should not be used to clean a laptop, as they can damage it.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{computational}} {{protein design}} calculations enable the evaluation and selection of protein sequences {{in the context}} of a single native structure. However many proteins natively require multiple distinct conformations for functionality. Recently, a novel algorithm has been developed which considers several structures in a single optimization calculation. This new method could be useful for designing proteins that need to accommodate several conformations. We sought to test this algorithm on triosephosphate isomerase (TIM). Loop 6 in TIM is a lid with open and closed conformations that facilitate substrate binding, product diffusion, and catalysis. It uses two 3 -amino acid hinges that provide the flexibility for the open-closed transition. In the present work we use multi-state design (MSD) methods to design the flexible hinges in TIM. We are in the process of assessing the applicability of MSD for the design of flexible protein <b>hinges</b> by exhaustive <b>screening</b> of computationally designed libraries. The results will suggest whether, by considering both conformations of the enzyme instead of purely the open or closed conformations, our methods provide libraries enriched in catalytically active TIMs...|$|R
40|$|Although {{an annual}} {{screening}} programme for lung cancer {{has been carried}} out widely in Japan since 1987, there is insufficient evidence to confirm its efficacy in terms of reducing mortality. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the lung cancer screening which has been widely carried out in Japan since 1987, a case–control study was conducted in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. In the study area, chest X-ray examinations for all participants and sputum cytology for high-risk participants were offered annually. Case subjects, who had died from lung cancer (174), and control subjects matched by sex, year of birth, residence and smoking status (801), who had been alive at the time of diagnosis of the corresponding case, were selected from the National Health Insurance <b>holders.</b> <b>Screening</b> histories of the subjects were compared between cases and matched controls for the identical calendar period before the time of diagnosis of the cases. The odds ratio of death from lung cancer for those screened within 12 months vs those not screened was 0. 401 (95 % CI: 0. 272 – 0. 591) with adjustment by smoking index. Our results suggest that annual lung cancer screening might reduce mortality from lung cancer by approximately 60 %. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
6000|$|It is a mean {{thing and}} an unhandsome to [...] "do" [...] a {{continent}} in five-hundred-mile jumps. But after those swine and bullocks at Chicago I felt that complete change of air would be good. The United States at present hinge in or about Chicago, as a double-leaved <b>screen</b> <b>hinges.</b> To be sure, the tiny New England States call {{a trip to}} Pennsylvania [...] "going west," [...] but the larger-minded citizen seems to reckon his longitude from Chicago. Twenty years hence the centre of population--that shaded square on the census map--will have shifted, men say, far west of Chicago. Twenty years later {{it will be on}} the Pacific slope. Twenty years after that America will begin to crowd up, and there will be some trouble. People will demand manufactured goods for their reduced-establishment households at the cheapest possible rates, and the cry that the land is rich enough to afford protection will cease with a great abruptness. At present it is the farmer who pays most dearly for the luxury of high prices. In the old days, when the land was fresh and there was plenty of it and it cropped like the garden of Eden, he did not mind paying. Now there is not so much free land, and the old acres are needing stimulants, which cost money, and the farmer, who pays for everything, is beginning to ask questions. Also the great American nation, which individually never shuts a door behind its noble self, very seldom attempts to put back anything that it has taken from Nature's shelves. It grabs all it can and moves on. But the moving-on is nearly finished and the grabbing must stop, and then the Federal Government will have to establish a Woods and Forests Department the like of which was never seen in the world before. And all {{the people who have been}} accustomed to hack, mangle, and burn timber as they please will object, with shots and protestations, to this infringement of their rights. The nigger will breed bounteously, and he will have to be reckoned with; and the manufacturer will have to be contented with smaller profits, and he will have to be reckoned with; and the railways will no longer rule the countries through which they run, and they will have to be reckoned with. And nobody will approve of it in the least.|$|R
