40|$|Purpose: Hereditary {{haemochromatosis}} (HH) is {{a genetic}} disease with autosomal recessive trait. Recent studies demonstrated {{the importance of}} C 282 Y gene mutation in the aetiology of HH. Free iron accumulating in pancreas <b>deteriorates</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> synthesis which can lead to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) in patients with HH. There has been no study determining the prevalence of haemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations and HH in diabetic patients in Turkey. We planned this study in order to investigate the C 282 Y and H 63 D mutation that cause HH in T 2 DM. Material and Method: In this study, we included 185 patients with T 2 DM. Patients older than thirty-five years, not taking vitamin supplementation, iron preparates and/or oral contraceptives and those without any signs of active bleeding were included while patients with any infectious, systemic or immune disease were excluded from the study. Serum transferrin saturation (TS), ferritin, iron, and total iron binding capacity levels were measured after 12 hours of fasting. Results: Ten (5. 4...|$|E

40|$|Objective: G protein-coupled {{receptor}} (GPCR) signaling regulates <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> pancreatic β cell-proliferation. While much {{knowledge has}} been gained regarding how GPCRs are activated in β cells, less {{is known about}} the mechanisms controlling their deactivation. In many cell types, termination of GPCR signaling is controlled by the family of Regulators of G-protein Signaling (RGS). RGS proteins are expressed in most eukaryotic cells and ensure a timely return to the GPCR inactive state upon removal of the stimulus. The aims of this study were i) to determine if RGS 16, the most highly enriched RGS protein in β cells, regulates <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> β-cell proliferation and, if so, ii) to elucidate the mechanisms underlying such effects. Methods: Mouse and human islets were infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing shRNA or cDNA sequences to knock-down or overexpress RGS 16, respectively. 60  h post-infection, <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> cAMP levels were measured in static incubations in the presence of glucose and various secretagogues. β-cell proliferation was measured in infected islets after 72  h in the presence of 16. 7  mM glucose ± somatostatin and various inhibitors. Results: RGS 16 mRNA levels are strongly up-regulated in islets of Langerhans under hyperglycemic conditions in vivo and ex vivo. RGS 16 overexpression stimulated glucose-induced <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> in isolated mouse and human islets while, conversely, <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> was impaired following RGS 16 knock-down. <b>Insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> was no longer affected by RGS 16 knock-down when islets were pre-treated with pertussis toxin to inactivate Gαi/o proteins, or {{in the presence of a}} somatostatin receptor antagonist. RGS 16 overexpression increased intracellular cAMP levels, and its effects were blocked by an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor. Finally, RGS 16 overexpression prevented the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> β-cell proliferation. Conclusions: Our results identify RGS 16 as a novel regulator of β-cell function that coordinately controls <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> proliferation by limiting the tonic inhibitory signal exerted by δ-cell-derived somatostatin in islets...|$|R

Therefore, finding an accurate method to assess <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> sensitivity using clinically available data would {{enhance the quality of}} diabetic medical care. In an effort to find such a method, we developed a computational approach to derive indices of these factors using a 2 -h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). To evaluate our method, clinical data from subjects who received an OGTT and a glucose clamp test were examined. Our <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> index was significantly correlated with an analogous index obtained from a hyperglycemic clamp test (r =  0. 90, n =  46, p <  0. 001).

Between October 2012 and June 2014, we monitored 202 diabetes patients who were {{admitted to the hospital}} of Asahi Life Foundation for glycemic control, as well as for training and education in diabetes management. We measured glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) six months after discharge to assess disease management. In univariate analysis, fasting plasma C-peptide immunoreactivity (F-CPR) and pooled urine CPR (U-CPR) were significantly associated with HbA 1 c, in contrast to ΔCPR and C-peptide index (CPI). This association was strongly independent of most other patient variables. In exploratory factor analysis, five underlying factors, namely insulin resistance, aging, sex differences, <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion,</b> <b>and</b> glycemic control, represented patient characteristics.

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{constitute}} a growing class of non-coding RNAs that {{are thought to}} regulate gene expression by translational repression(1). Several miRNAs in animals exhibit tissue-specific or developmental-stage-specific expression, indicating that they could play important roles in many biological processes(2 - 4). To study the role of miRNAs in pancreatic endocrine cells we cloned and identified a novel, evolutionarily conserved and islet-specific miRNA (miR- 375). Here we show that overexpression of miR- 375 suppressed glucose-induced <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion,</b> <b>and</b> conversely, inhibition of endogenous miR- 375 function enhanced <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion.</b> The mechanism by which secretion is modified by miR- 375 is independent of changes in glucose metabolism or intracellular Ca 2 +-signalling but correlated with a direct effect on insulin exocytosis. Myotrophin (Mtpn) was predicted to be and validated as a target of miR- 375. Inhibition of Mtpn by small interfering (si) RNA mimicked the effects of miR- 375 on glucose-stimulated <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> exocytosis.

40|$|Do {{functional}} {{linkages between}} islet endocrine cells exist? The effect {{of differences in}} frequency and distribution of islet endocrine cells on B cell function was examined in islets from the ventral (ventral islets) and dorsal (dorsal islets) areas of the rat pancreas. Dorsal islets contained 10 times as much glucagon as ventral islets, whereas insulin and total protein contents were similar. Basal rates of <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> proinsulin biosynthesis were similar in {{the two types of}} islet, but, under conditions of glucose stimulation, both <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> proinsulin biosynthesis were significantly greater in the glucagon-rich dorsal islets. Similarly, glucose utilization rates an ATP levels were greater in dorsal islets. In contrast, the rates of processing of newly synthesized proinsulin were similar in ventral and dorsal islets. That the islet glucagon content may have affected B cell function is inferred from two independent findings. Firstly, basal and glucose-stimulated cyclic AMP contents of glucagon-rich dorsal islets were greater than those of ventral islets. Secondly, in the presence of excess exogenous glucagon (1 microgram/ml), the differences in glucose-induced <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> proinsulin biosynthesis rates between the two types of islets were eliminated. These results strongly suggest that changes in the relative proportions of the different islet endocrine cells exert marked effects on islet function.

40|$|SummaryIn vertebrates, β {{cells are}} {{aggregated}} in the form of pancreatic islets. Within these islets, communication between β cells inhibits basal <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> enhances glucose-stimulated <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion,</b> thus contributing to glucose homeostasis during fasting and feeding. In {{the search for}} the underlying molecular mechanism, we have discovered that β cells communicate via ephrin-As and EphAs. We provide evidence that ephrin-A 5 is required for glucose-stimulated <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion.</b> We further show that EphA-ephrin-A-mediated β cell communication is bidirectional: EphA forward signaling inhibits <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion,</b> whereas ephrin-A reverse signaling stimulates <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion.</b> EphA forward signaling is downregulated in response to glucose, which indicates that, under basal conditions, β cells use EphA forward signaling to suppress <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> that, under stimulatory conditions, they shift to ephrin-A reverse signaling to enhance <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion.</b> Thus, we explain how β cell communication in pancreatic islets conversely affects basal <b>and</b> glucose-stimulated <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> to improve glucose homeostasis...|$|R

We demonstrated that FO altered <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> resistance in {{polycystic ovary syndrome}} (PCOS) women but FLX did not. Surprisingly, the effects of FO {{were similar to those}} of the n- 6 PUFA-rich soybean oil (SBO). Since increased branched chain (BCAA) and aromatic amino acids (AA) affect <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> resistance, we investigated whether FO, FLX and /or SBO affect plasma metabolites, especially AA. Methods and findingsIn this six-week, randomized, 3 -parallel arm, double-blinded study, 54 women received 3. 5 g/day FO, FLX or SBO. In 51 completers (17 from each arm), fasting plasma metabolites were measured at the beginning and at the end. As compared to FLX, FO and SBO increased insulin response and resistance as well as several BCAA and aromatic AA. Pathway analysis indicated that FO exerted the largest biochemical impact, affecting AA degradation and biosynthesis, amine, polyamine degradation and alanine, glycine, l-carnitine biosynthesis and TCA cycle, while FLX had minimal impact affecting only alanine biosynthesis and l-cysteine degradation. ConclusionEffects of FO and SBO on plasma AA were similar and differed significantly from those of the FLX. The primary target of dietary PUFA is not known.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} that the transient receptor potential melastatin-like subtype 5 (TRPM 5) channel, a Ca(2 +) -activated monovalent cation channel, {{is involved in the}} stimulus-secretion coupling in the mouse pancreatic β-cells. We have studied the role of the TRPM 5 channel in regulating <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> cytoplasmic free Ca(2 +) concentration ([Ca(2 +) ](i)) in the rat β-cells by using triphenylphosphine oxide, a selective inhibitor of the channel. METHODS: <b>Insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> from islets from Sprague-Dawley rats was measured in batch incubations. Cytoplasmic free Ca(2 +) concentration was measured from single β-cells by fura- 2 -based microfluorometry. RESULTS: Triphenylphosphine oxide did not alter <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> [Ca(2 +) ](i) response triggered by KCl or fructose. It inhibited <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> in response to glucose, L-arginine, and glucagon-like peptide 1.

The FINDRISC {{was significantly associated with}} decreases in <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> <b>insulin</b> sensitivity (P< 0. 0001), and with a 4. 14 -fold increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes, 2. 43 -fold increased risk of drug-treated hypertension, 1. 61 -fold increased risk of CVD, and 1. 55 -increased risk of total mortality (the FINDRISC ≥ 12 vs. < 12 points). In conclusion, the FINDRISC predicts impairment in <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> <b>and</b> <b>insulin</b> sensitivity, the conversion to type 2 diabetes, drug-treated hypertension, CVD events and total mortality...|$|R
