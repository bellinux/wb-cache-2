5|$|Although {{the founders}} of the Tang related to the <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> the earlier Han dynasty (3rd century–3rd century), the basis for much of their {{administrative}} organization was very similar to the previous Northern and Southern dynasties. The Northern Zhou (6th century) fubing system of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The equal-field system of the Northern Wei (4th–6th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.|$|E

5|$|Compositions in the haridasa {{literature}} are sub-divided into four types: kirthane, suladi, ugabhoga and mundige. Kirthanes are devotional musical compositions with refrains based on raga and tala and celebrate the <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> god. The suladi are tala based, the ugabhoga are melody based while the mundige {{are in the}} form of riddles. Compositions were also modelled on jogula (lullaby songs) and sobane (marriage songs). A common feature of haridasa compositions are influences from the Hindu epics, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and Bhagavata.|$|E

5|$|It is {{a long-standing}} practice, {{as with many}} Jesuit schools around the world, that pupils write A.M.D.G. in the top left hand corner of any piece of work they do. It stands for the Latin phrase Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam which means For the Greater <b>Glory</b> <b>of</b> God. At {{the end of a}} piece of work they write L.D.S. in the centre of the page. It stands for Laus Deo Semper which means Praise to God Always. These are both {{traditional}} Jesuit mottoes.|$|E

5|$|Meyerbeer's large choral 'tableaux' {{also made}} a major {{contribution}} to the overall dramatic effect; the composer particularly sought opportunities to write such large-scale crowd scenes, and preferred libretti which offered such possibilities. Crosten writes: 'These massive developed sections are the chief <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> the Meyerbeerian opera, for {{they are not only}} big in volume but big in their structural design'.|$|E
5|$|When World War I {{forced the}} closure of all European opera houses, Paoli made his living as a {{professional}} boxer. Unfortunately, he also lost his singing voice during this period.

5|$|After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, {{the army}} came to arm the most {{important}} place. For technical reasons (distance of communication with bases) and because new places of historical interest were accessible, the top brass debated whether to transfer the postings of new recruits at Massada to a more appropriate place. It was Latrun that was finally chosen. In the 1980s, a commemorative site and a museum {{was built on the}} old police site. The complex has a wall listing all the names of the fallen soldiers since the War Of Independence, and a monument to the <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> the heroes and another for reverence. The museum has nearly 200 tanks and other armoured vehicles of many kinds.|$|E

5|$|Christodorus of Coptus, an Egyptian {{poet and}} writer wrote a lengthy (416 lines long) hexameter piece of poetry {{inspired}} by the <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> the statues housed within {{the halls of the}} Baths of Zeuxippus. This poem actually consisted of a number of short epigrams (six in total), each focusing on one or a small group of statues within the Baths, designed to combine to form one work. While {{it has been suggested that}} the epigrams of Christodorus of Coptus may actually have been inscribed on the (bases) of the statues themselves, this is unlikely because of his use of the ekphrastic medium, and the presence of the past tense in the text.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{criticism}} of Albrecht and the event it portrayed, the painting often {{is seen as}} strongly anti-Prussian. While it appears to glorify Poland, it is also critical of the country. Matejko went beyond portraying the <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> a historical event and attempted to convey hints of how the country's history would play out in the future. This event was merely a hollow victory that failed to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage was an empty gesture {{and that it was}} Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland. Nobody in the painting is smiling except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí also practiced landscaping, {{often in}} urban settings. He aimed to place his {{works in the}} most {{appropriate}} natural and architectural surroundings by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the slate of Bellesguard and the grey Bierzo granite in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the Güell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions. Gaudí's harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of the <b>Glory</b> <b>of</b> the Rosary at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself—here the Montserrat rock—nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned {{the path to the}} Holy Cave.|$|E

5|$|How {{great the}} <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> Origen was, appears {{from the fact}} that Firmilianus, bishop of Cæsarea, with all the Cappadocian bishops, sought a visit from him, and entertained him for a long while. Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the holy places, he came to Cæsarea and was {{instructed}} at length by Origen in the Holy Scriptures. It appears also {{from the fact that}} he went to Antioch, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander, and a woman religiously disposed, and was there held in great honour, and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become a Christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant.|$|E
5|$|In 1584, Virupaksha Pandita, {{the head}} priest at the Virupaksha Temple in Vijayanagara, wrote an account {{on the life}} and deeds of the 12th-century saint and vachana poet Chennabasava. The writing, titled Chenna Basava Purana, regards the protagonist as an {{incarnation}} of god Shiva and describes the <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> Shiva and his famous devotees. The book gives valuable information, including dates, about early Veerashaiva saints and vachanakaras (vachana poets). In addition to religious content, the writing provides useful insights about the former capital Vijayanagara, its royal palace, its market places and merchants, its military encampments, specialisations and divisions and the guilds of workers who served the military in various capacities. Other authors from the 16th century were Chermanka (Chermanka Kavya), Virabhadraraja (Virabhadra Vijaya), Chennabasavanka (Mahadevi Akkanna Purana), Nanjunda of Ikkeri (Bhairavaesvara Kavya) and Sadasiva Yogi (Ramanatha Vilasa).|$|E
5|$|In AD 26, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is {{a wealthy}} prince and {{merchant}} in Jerusalem, {{who lives with}} his mother, Miriam (Martha Scott); his sister, Tirzah (Cathy O'Donnell); their loyal slave, Simonides (Sam Jaffe); and Simonides' daughter, Esther (Haya Harareet). Esther loves Judah, but is committed to another. Judah's childhood friend, the Roman citizen Messala (Stephen Boyd), is now a tribune. After several years away from Jerusalem, Messala returns as the new commander of the Roman garrison. Messala believes in the <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> Rome and its imperial power, while Judah is devoted to his faith and {{the freedom of the}} Jewish people. This difference causes tension between the friends, and results in their split after Messala issues an ultimatum demanding that Judah delivers potential rebels amongst the populace to the Roman authorities.|$|E
