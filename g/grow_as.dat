5|$|Some species <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> {{unicellular}} yeasts that reproduce by budding or binary fission. Dimorphic fungi {{can switch}} between a yeast phase and a hyphal phase {{in response to}} environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{cells of}} most fungi <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> tubular, elongated, and thread-like (filamentous) {{structures}} called hyphae, which may contain multiple nuclei and extend by growing at their tips. Each tip contains {{a set of}} aggregated vesicles—cellular structures consisting of proteins, lipids, and other organic molecules—called the Spitzenkörper. Both fungi and oomycetes <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> filamentous hyphal cells. In contrast, similar-looking organisms, such as filamentous green algae, grow by repeated cell division within a chain of cells. There are also single-celled fungi (yeasts) that do not form hyphae, and some fungi have both hyphal and yeast forms.|$|E
5000|$|In comparison, the {{relative}} error bound for naive summation (simply adding {{the numbers in}} sequence, rounding at each step) <b>grows</b> <b>as</b> [...] multiplied by the condition number. [...] In practice, {{it is much more}} likely that the rounding errors have a random sign, with zero mean, so that they form a random walk; in this case, naive summation has a root mean square relative error that <b>grows</b> <b>as</b> [...] and pairwise summation as an error that <b>grows</b> <b>as</b> [...] on average.|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the maximal value in a size n sample from GEM(θ) {{distribution}} is distributed as a sum of independent geometric random variables. This implies that the maximal value <b>grows</b> <b>as</b> θ(n) as n→∞. For the two-parametric GEM(α,θ) distribution we {{show that the}} maximal value <b>grows</b> <b>as</b> a random factor of n^α/(1 -α) and find the limiting distribution. Comment: 10 page...|$|R

5|$|After Edgar Dewdney {{ordered that}} the {{government}} be moved south to meet the railway in Regina, it was confirmed as the new territorial capital on March 27, 1883. Construction of a new legislature began. In Regina, the government continued to <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> {{the size of the}} settlement increased rapidly. The legislature had the most sitting members in Northwest Territories history after the fifth general election in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Although Chadderton's {{industries}} declined {{during the}} mid-20th century, the town continued to <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of}} suburbanisation and urban renewal. The legacy of the town's industrial past remains visible in its landscape of red-brick cotton mills, now used as warehouses or distribution centres. Some of these are listed buildings because of their architectural, historical and cultural significance.|$|E

5|$|Both {{bacteria}} and eukaryotes, but not archaea, make spores. Some species of Haloarchaea undergo phenotypic switching and <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> several different cell types, including thick-walled structures that {{are resistant to}} osmotic shock and allow the archaea to survive in water at low salt concentrations, {{but these are not}} reproductive structures and may instead help them reach new habitats.|$|E
5|$|Cashews (Anacardium occidentale) <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> a drupe that is {{attached}} to the cashew apple, the fruit of the cashew tree. Native to northeastern Brazil, the cashew was introduced to India and East Africa in the sixteenth century, where they remain a major commercial crop. The nut must be roasted to remove the caustic shell oil before being consumed.|$|E
5|$|Following various {{military}} conquests in the Greek East, Romans adapted {{a number}} of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system. They began physical training to prepare the boys to <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> Roman citizens and for eventual recruitment into the army. Conforming to discipline was a point of great emphasis. Girls generally received instruction from their mothers {{in the art of}} spinning, weaving, and sewing.|$|E

5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders have to molt to <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> their cuticle ("skin") cannot stretch. In {{some species}} males mate with newly molted females, which are {{too weak to}} be {{dangerous}} to the males. Most spiders live for only one to two years, although some tarantulas can live in captivity for over 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Narcissus is a genus of {{perennial}} herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes, dying {{back after}} flowering to an underground storage bulb. They regrow {{in the following}} year from brown-skinned ovoid bulbs with pronounced necks, and reach heights of 5–80cm depending on the species. Dwarf species such as N. asturiensis have a maximum height of 5–8cm, while Narcissus tazetta may <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> tall as 80cm.|$|E

The International Cultural Center provides a continual series of conferences, lectures, art exhibitions, and performances.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{fewer than}} a dozen mills are still standing, the {{majority}} of which are used for light engineering or as distribution centres. Despite an economic depression brought about by the demise of cotton spinning, Royton's population has continued to <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> a result of intensive housing redevelopment which has modernised its former Edwardian districts.|$|E
5|$|Although heavy {{industry}} died {{out in the}} area during the early twentieth century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Giffnock has continued to <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> a dormitory town, supported by its position within the Greater Glasgow area, from roughly 1,425 residents {{in the early twentieth}} century to 16,178 in 2001. Expansion continues due to several new housing developments; however, much of the land is now urbanised or designated parkland, leaving little room for further expansion.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there was}} some fear of Rome and concern with her methods, the {{coalition}} arrayed against Philip continued to <b>grow.</b> <b>As</b> allowed for by the treaty, Pergamon, Elis and Messenia, followed by Sparta, all agreed to join the alliance against Macedon. The Roman fleet, together with the Pergamene fleet, controlled the sea, and Macedon and her allies were threatened on land {{by the rest of}} the coalition. The Roman strategy of encumbering Philip with a war among Greeks in Greece was succeeding, so much so that when Laevinus went to Rome to take up his consulship, he was able to report that the legion deployed against Philip could be safely withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|B.integrifolia is {{a highly}} {{variable}} species. It is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (80ft) in height, but in sheltered locations it can reach 35 metres (110ft). In more exposed areas it may <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> a small, gnarled tree, reaching {{to no more than}} about 5 metres (15ft), and in highly exposed positions, such as on exposed coastal headlands, it may even be reduced to a small shrub.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert regions where not many other crops will <b>grow.</b> <b>As</b> {{well as an}} important source of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E
