25|$|In 2010 {{approximately}} 1.6 million Palestinians {{lived in}} the Gaza Strip, almost 1.0 million of them UN-registered refugees. The majority of the Palestinians descend from refugees who were driven from or left their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

According to the UN, unless remedial steps are taken to repair the basic infrastructure by 2020, with a further <b>demographic</b> <b>increase</b> of 500,000 and intensified housing problems, the Gaza Strip will become effectively uninhabitable.

50|$|In the mid-1970s, {{evidence}} {{began to}} emerge that the traditional homelessness population predominantly consisting of middle aged or older males was changing.

The {{proportion}} of whites in the city's population grew faster between 2000 and 2006 than that of any other U.S. city. By 2010, Atlanta's white population had increased by 22,763 people. The white percentage increased from 31% in 2000, to 35% in 2006, to 38% in 2010, more than double the increase between 1990 and 2000. During the same time, the city's black population decreased by 31,678 people, shrinking from 61.4% of the city's population in 2000 to 54.0% in 2010. The demographic changes are due to an influx of whites into gentrifying intown neighborhoods, such as East Atlanta and the Old Fourth Ward, coupled with a movement of blacks into adjacent suburbs, such as Clayton County. Note that this phenomenon is not unique to Atlanta, as Washington, D.C. is undergoing a similar demographic change.|$|E
