40|$|In Smith v Jenkins (‘Smith’), 1 the High Court {{recognised}} a defence of <b>joint</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>enterprise</b> to {{liability in}} the tort of negligence. It affirmed {{the existence of}} this defence in a series of cases, the most recent and important of which is Gala v Preston (‘Gala’). 2 The correctness of this line of authority, which has proved highly influential in several other jurisdictions, 3 is presently being reconsidered by the High Court in an appeal against the decision of the Western Australian Court of Appeal in Miller v Miller (‘Miller’). 4 It is with this appeal that this article is concerned. It makes two central claims. First, in the event that the Court retains the <b>joint</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>enterprise</b> defence, it should perform radical surgery on it so as to render it less offensive to fundamental principles of tort law. The second contention is that the Court should break with its previous decisions recognising the defence — all of which are contaminated by serious confusion — and consign the defence to legal oblivion. It serves no useful purpose and is pregnant with the potential to produce significant injustice...|$|E
40|$|In 1991, the High Court {{delivered}} {{judgment in}} Gala v Preston. This landmark case concerned the defence of illegality to liability arising in the tort of negligence. It established that parties to a <b>joint</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>enterprise</b> do not owe duties of care inter se if {{the nature of}} the enterprise is such that it would be 2 ̆ 2 impossible 2 ̆ 2 or not 2 ̆ 2 feasible 2 ̆ 2 to ask how the reasonable person would have acted in their circumstances. The High Court recently reconsidered the defence in Miller v Miller. This was the first opportunity since Gala that the court has had to address this defence directly. The High Court replaced the principle in Gala with a test based on the legislature 2 ̆ 7 s purpose in creating the offence that the plaintiff committed. This article delineates that approach and identifies some difficulties with it...|$|E
40|$|The High Court has {{reserved}} judgement in {{an appeal}} against {{the decision of}} the Western Australian Court of Appeal in Miller v Miller (2009) 54 MVR 367. This appeal calls into question the defence of <b>joint</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>enterprise,</b> which is an answer to liability in the tort of negligence. It is with this appeal that this article is concerned. Two main arguments are presented. The first is that the defence is framed in a highly unsatisfactory way. It is governed by nonsensical rules, many of which are inconsistent with fundamental principles of tort law. Accordingly, should the High Court retain the defence, it is submitted that it should reformulate it so that it blends in with the legal environment in which it resides. The second and more fundamental argument is that the defence should be abolished. It is a stain on the law of torts. Not only are there no convincing arguments in support of it, but there are powerful reasons against its existence...|$|E

40|$|Research into rural {{entrepreneurship}} {{continues to}} expand, albeit slowly. A common {{theme in the}} literature {{is the creation of}} value and its extraction from the environment. Rural entrepreneurship potentially covers a wide gamut of activity including the illegal. Also studies into agricultural entrepreneurship particularly traditional accounts of "rurality" tend to emphasise the rural idyll. Most studies tend to concentrate on the application of entrepreneurial theory to issues of rurality and as such exist on the margins of entrepreneurship research - being primarily studies into rurality and not entrepreneurship per se. Rarely do such studies impinge on issues of <b>illegal</b> <b>enterprise</b> that shatter this rural idyll. As a consequence, rural and farming rogues have been neglected as subjects of research. Yet, in the present perceived climate of economic decline in agricultural income, extracting value from the environment can be difficult and can give rise to <b>illegal</b> <b>enterprise</b> in the countryside as well as an increase in the prevalence of farming rogues. The case story, presented in this paper relates to one such <b>illegal</b> <b>enterprise,</b> namely the <b>illegal</b> slaughter of sheep for the Muslim "halal" market, known to those in the know as the smokies trade. Using the case story methodology this paper explores an issue of contemporary <b>illegal</b> <b>enterprise</b> in the countryside telling an important story that is otherwise difficult to evidence empirically...|$|R
40|$|Harding, Christopher, (2009) 'Capturing the cartel?s friends: Cartel {{facilitation}} and {{the idea}} of joint criminal enterprise', European Law Review 34 (2), pp. 298 - 309. Keywords: Cartels; EC law; Joint enterprise; PenaltiesThe recent ruling by the Court of First Instance in AC-Treuhand (T- 99 / 04), confirming that a consultancy firm which had facilitated the operation of the Organic Peroxide Cartel thereby infringed Art. 81 (1) EC, provides some insight into the nature of punishable cartel offending. Now that involvement in business cartels attracts significant sanctions at both a corporate and individual level the basis for such penal liability requires a clear justification. The facilitation of cartels is part of that extra layer of subterfuge which adds to the reprehensible character of the anticompetitive damage arising from cartels, so as to justify penal measures such as large fines and prison terms. A number of recent judgments serve to emphasise that the tough regulation of cartels is as much about dealing with subterfuge and legal defiance as the anticompetitive behaviour in itself. It is also instructive in this context to draw upon the model of the joint criminal enterprise (JCE), as it has been developed in war crimes proceedings, as a way of viewing an anticompetitive cartel as a <b>joint</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>enterprise,</b> which necessarily and significantly includes the role of facilitating actors {{as well as that of}} actual price fixers and the like.

40|$|Purpose: There is an {{emerging}} {{body of literature}} driven by entrepreneurship scholars which attempts to differentiate between the conceptual and theoretical aspects of legal, illegal, amoral and immoral entrepreneurial practice. Many such studies are based of necessity on individual cases and attempt to develop typologies, models and theories. Legal and illegal entrepreneurship are regarded as separate spheres of study but seldom do we pause to consider the actual human consequences to individuals, communities and places which arise from <b>illegal</b> <b>enterprise.</b> Consequentially, in this invited paper we examine a powerful case of embedded <b>illegal</b> <b>enterprise</b> in a closed ethnic community, exposed through a fatal explosion in an illegal alcohol still in Boston, Lincolnshire. Boston or ‘Bostongraad’ as it is ironically relabelled {{is a classic example}} of an ethnic enclave in which legal and illegal entrepreneurial practices are embedded. We also develop a typology of legal-illegal entrepreneurial actions. Design/methodology/approach: This study combines a literature review on illegal entrepreneurship with observations based on documentary research methodology. From such readings and findings we develop a typology of enterprise orientated crime committed by a variety of enterprising individuals in an ethnic community. Findings: Research limitations/implications: This paper demonstrates the embeddedness of illegal entrepreneurial activity in an entrepreneurial community and outlines a typological schema for differentiating between the informal economy, illicit and <b>enterprise,</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>enterprise</b> and criminal entrepreneurship. Practical implications: Policy and practical implications for this scheme and the need to develop sustainable entrepreneurial communities are discussed.

40|$|Abstract In rural {{sociology}} and rural studies, rurality {{in many countries}} is commonly constructed as an idyllic space in which crime is perceived as an urban problem. In other countries, however, rurality is constructed {{as a place where}} the individual is vulnerable and the population is socially beyond the urban. This article questions the construction of rurality as idyllic by reporting on research in rural areas which demonstrates that crime, in particular illicit and <b>illegal</b> <b>enterprise</b> based crime, is becoming more prevalent in the {UK} countryside. In urban areas, illicit and illegal forms of entrepreneurship are distinctive in terms of how they are construed and enacted so why would it not be similar in rural areas? The paper presents a theoretical framework {{based on the work of}} Ferdinand Tonnies which demonstrates that contemporary examples of roguery exist in the {UK} countryside. We make more visible what previously was invisible, or ignored in the literature.

Since illicit and/or <b>illegal</b> rural <b>enterprise</b> is under-researched this constitutes an original attempt to frame an emerging phenomenon of interest...|$|R
40|$|Food Supply chain {{theory and}} {{practice}} assumes that the processes involved are legal and value adding. In this paper, using examples from the UK halal (sheep) meat supply chain, we outline a value extracting value chain through a mixed methods qualitative approach consisting of face-to-face-interviews and a documentary research strategy underpinned by Narrative Inquiry. Building on previous theoretical work on <b>Illegal</b> Rural <b>Enterprise,</b> we present a narrative of an individual rogue-farmer, and explore {{his involvement in the}} illegal halal (‘smokies’) trade over a fifteen-year period. The paper provides a compelling story that will enable investigators to better understand <b>illegal</b> <b>enterprise</b> from a supply chain perspective and more adequately address the concerns stated in the UK Fraud Act 2006. The paper will be useful to food standards agencies in that furthers our understanding of entrepreneurial practice and morality in the food industry. The results demonstrate that <b>illegal</b> rural <b>enterprise</b> is a multi-faceted concept that requires an understanding of business practices and processes alongside a multi-agency approach to enterprise orientated crime. Our approach suggests that supply chains can be ‘flipped’ in order to understand illegal processes in addition to conventional legal processes...|$|R
