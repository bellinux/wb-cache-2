50|$|Sand is a {{sediment}} {{made from}} small grains or particles with diameters between about 60 µm and 2 mm. Mud (see mudflats below) is a sediment made from particles finer than sand. This {{small particle size}} means that mud particles tend to stick together, whereas sand particles do not. Mud is not easily shifted by waves and currents, and when it dries out, cakes into a solid. By contrast, sand is easily shifted by waves and currents, and when sand dries out it can be blown in the wind, accumulating into shifting sand dunes. Beyond the high tide mark, if the beach is low-lying, the wind can <b>form</b> <b>rolling</b> hills of sand dunes. Small dunes shift and reshape {{under the influence of}} the wind while larger dunes stabilise the sand with vegetation.|$|E

Generation process of tooth profile during the <b>form</b> <b>rolling</b> by the rack die of counter flow type is investigated from the result of simulation. The experiments using both the rack die and the round die are performed under the same conditions as those of simulation.

For the involute gear <b>form,</b> <b>rolling</b> and sliding leads {{to a loss of}} gear efficiency and generation of heat in the contact zone. The power dissipated is used to set the conditions for a series of rod on disc experiments. The rod-on-disc data are processed in a time averaging procedure, which allows prediction of the complete gear temperature. This is assessed with analytical and finite element models to validate the predicted temperature rise against the experimental data. The significance is that the experimental procedures may be used to assess gear thermal performance without testing full gear pairs...|$|E

In the initial phase of aggregation, resting discoid platelets attach to flat substrates (e.g., vascular endothelial cells in vivo) with filopodia through FGN–integrin αIIbβ 3 binding [20]. In the subsequent growing phase, in addition to integrin αIIbβ 3, GPIb-V-IX is involved in aggregation through vWF, FGN, and FN. In the final phase, GPIb-V-IX acts as a predominant adhesion receptor to <b>form</b> <b>rolling</b> aggregates with vWF. These findings indicate that FN and vWF play crucial roles in the initial and late phases of aggregation, respectively.|$|E

For smoothing contact surface discretized by linear triangles, an algorithm is followed to develop a higher order quadratic interpolation of the curved surface from the positions and normal vectors of the nodes, as proposed by Nagata. Normal vectors are calculated at each node from the existing discretized surface by considering a patch of surrounding elements. This is accomplished by the mean of normal voting strategy. The efficiency and reliability of the resulting contact model are checked through several examples like indenting and ironing a bulk parallelepiped.

Powder metallurgy test gears with a module of 3. 0, tooth number of 20, pressure angle of 20 °, helix angle of 20 ° and face width of 23 mm were machined from 0. 5 Ni- 1. 0 Mo high-density (7. 50 Mg/m 3) sintered steel packs via the single-press single-sinter (1 P 1 S) route. The modified tooth profile of the dies and the reciprocating rolling schedule were optimized empirically through trial and error. The experimental results revealed the feasibility of the new special rolling machine to obtain high-precision helical gears with a regular involute tooth profile corresponding to DIN 5 and a crowned lead by using a die having an unmodified lead profile. The surface densification state was almost uniform in the tooth lead direction, and a fully densified flank layer was observed from the surface down {{to a depth of}} approximately 0. 5 mm...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} rolling horizon {{procedures for}} solving a multistage inventory problem with facilities-in-series. In such an inventory system, {{we assume that}} the raw material is processed successively through several facilities before reaching the customer. The input to a facility comes from one preceding facility (or the raw material) and the output from the facility goes to one succeeding facility (or the customer). The rolling horizon procedures <b>form</b> <b>rolling</b> production schedules by solving a finite horizon multiperiod problem and implementing only the first period's decisions. One period later, the multiperiod problem is updated as better forecasts become available and the process is repeated. The paper considers a simple case when holding costs are linear, production costs on a facility consist of a setup cost and a constant marginal cost of production, and production and holding costs are stationary in time. Demand is allowed to be nonstationary in time. Several rolling horizon procedures are developed for this case and a computational comparison is given. inventory/production: planning horizons, production scheduling...|$|E
40|$|Steering and {{suspension}} {{systems are}} components that supply driving safety in vehicles. For a correct working {{the mechanisms of}} these systems consist of many ball-joints that have different functions. Generally the ball-joints are assembled to systems in press-fit without any gaps, but even with residual forces. On the other hand excessive tightness causes high moments, which requires additional processes of manufacturing. But low tightness also creates gaps in joints. None of these conditions are desired. Manufacturing a ball-race that has long-life, low-friction and provides required working angles in every road condition, can be designed after long test processes and sample productions including lots of improvements. An important element of steering systems in vehicles is suspension ball-race that can be manufactured by assembling with plastic deformation after designing the ball-joint. In this study, during the manufacturing of the suspension ball-race supplying the motion transmission, the edge-form rolling process that is a subsection of rolling process of manufacturing methods based on plastic deformation was examined. Effects of pressure forces occurring after edge-form rolling in bearing systems at different values were studied by changing operation pressure of edge <b>form</b> <b>rolling</b> by means of specific numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} new application of electropolishing using a low-cost disc-form electrode offering fast {{improvement of the}} surface roughness of SKD 61. It requires no expensive special-purpose equipment or heavy material removal as conventional electrochemical machining does, and it also avoids the complex pre-polishing of the workpiece before the electropolishing. Round bars or round tubes produced by traditional turning, drawing, <b>form</b> <b>rolling,</b> or extrusion, can be successively electropolished using the designed disc-form electrodes. Five electrode designs are discussed. The experimental parameters include rotational speed of workpiece, electrical current rating and pulse period, electrode geometry, and electrode feed rate. Thinner disc and larger disc taper angle are associated with larger discharge space for the electrode, thus the polishing is more effective. A smaller end radius of the disc electrode produces higher current density and provides faster feed rate and a better polishing effect. A disc with discharge flute performs better, and larger flute back rake angle, side rake angle, wider flute, and deeper flute depth are also advantageous. Although the use of pulsed current slightly outperforms the fluted electrode using continuous current, it sacrifices both machining time and cost. The best electrode design is identified. A guideline {{for the design of}} electrodes is provided based on the experimental results...|$|E

40|$|Memory T {{lymphocytes}} extravasate {{at sites}} of inflammation, but the mechanisms employed by these cells to initiate contact and tethering with endothelium are incompletely understood. An {{important part of}} leukocyte extravasation is the initiation of rolling adhesions on endothelial selectins; such events have been studied in monocytes and neutrophils but not lymphocytes. In this study, the potential of T lymphocytes to adhere and roll on endothelial selectins in vitro was investigated. We demonstrate that T cells can form tethers and rolling adhesions on P selectin and E selectin under physiologic flow conditions. Tethering and rolling on P selectin was independent of cell- surface cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) expression, which correlated strictly with the capacity of T cells to <b>form</b> <b>rolling</b> adhesions under flow on E selectin. T cell tethering to P selectin was abolished by selective removal of cell surface sialomucins by a P. haemolytica O- glycoprotease, while cutaneous lymphocyte antigen expression was unaffected. A sialomucin molecule identical or closely related to P selectin glycoprotein ligand- 1 (PSGL- 1), the major P selectin ligand on neutrophils and HL- 60 cells, {{appears to be a}} major T cell ligand for P selectin. P selectin glycoprotein ligand- 1 does not appear to support T cell rolling on E selectin. In turn, E selectin ligands {{do not appear to be}} associated with sialomucins. These data demonstrate the presence of structurally distinct ligands for P or E selectins on T cells, provide evidence that both ligands can be coexpressed on a single T cell, and mediate tethering and rolling on the respective selectins in a mutually exclusive fashion...|$|E
40|$|We have {{compared}} {{the ability of}} human alpha/beta and gamma/delta T lymphocytes to adhere to selectin-bearing substrates, an interaction thought to be essential for homing and localization at sites of inflammation. Both T cell populations <b>form</b> <b>rolling</b> adhesions on E- and P-selectin substrates under physiologic flow conditions. Although equivalent to alpha/beta T cells in binding to E-selectin, gamma/delta T cells demonstrated greater ability to adhere to P-selectin that was purified or expressed {{on the surface of}} activated, adherent platelets. Under static conditions, 80 % of gamma/delta T cells and 53 % of alpha/beta T cells formed shear-resistant adhesions to P-selectin, whereas only 30 % of gamma/delta and alpha/beta T cells adhered to E- selectin. The enhance ability of gamma/delta T cells to adhere to P- selectin cannot be attributed to differences in expression of the P- selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL- 1), as all alpha/beta T cells versus approximately 75 % of gamma/delta T cells expressed PSGL- 1. Both cell populations expressed a similar percentage of the carbohydrate antigens sialyl LewisX and cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen. Depletion of lymphocyte populations or T cell clones bearing these oligosaccharides with the monoclonal antibody CSLEX- 1 and HECA- 452, respectively, resulted in a substantial reduction in adhesion to E-selectin and slight reduction in adhesion to P-selectin under flow conditions. Treatment of cells with an endopeptidase that selectively degrades O- sialomucins such as PSGL- 1, abolished P-selectin but not E-selectin adhesion. Removal of terminal sialic acids with neuraminidase or protease treatment of cells abrogated cell adhesion to both selectin substrates. These results provide direct evidence for the presence of distinct E- and P-selectin ligands on T lymphocytes and suggest that gamma/delta T cells may be preferentially recruited to inflammatory sites during the early stages of an immune response when P-selectin is upregulated...|$|E
