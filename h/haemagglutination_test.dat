5000|$|... ==Career in New Zealand== Manning {{arrived in}} Wellington in 1953 {{to take up}} the {{position}} of Assistant Director (Microbiology) at the National Health Institute. [...] He became Director of the Institute upon the sudden death of Dr James Blakelock in August 1955 and held this position until 1970. [...] Manning started the New Zealand Reference Culture Collection (NZRCC) at the Institute in 1955. [...] This involved establishing and running both the general and reference laboratories for bacteriology and virology with a special interest in antibiotic sensitivity methods and a <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test</b> for toxoplasmosis. [...] The collection was later designated as the national repository of organisms of national interest. The bacteriologist Sydney Josland worked under the direction of Manning at the Institute. Manning undertook a World Health Organisation Fellowship in 1966 and studied advances in laboratory organisation and methods. [...] Between 1970 and 1982, Manning was the Consultant Medical Microbiologist at Wellington Hospital. [...] In 1980, he became the first chairman of the Management Committee of the Department of Laboratory Services. [...] Manning was Clinical Lecturer at the Wellington School of Medicine in 1978 and became Clinical Reader in 1982.|$|E
5000|$|In humans, P. skrjabini infections {{can result}} {{in a wide variety of}} symptoms, {{rendering}} it difficult to diagnose and challenging to quickly enact proper treatment. [...] Diagnosis typically requires first a general recognition of the symptoms followed by laboratory and radiologic tests. [...] Radiology, for example, can pick up on P. skrjabini's migration to ectopic places like the brain. [...] Serological or immunological tests including intradermal test, immunodiffusion, indirect <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test,</b> enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot also play a key role in not only diagnosing the overall presence of Paragonimus parasites in the body but also distinguishing the various different species invading. [...] The ELISA test detects the antibody used to combat the P. skrjabini infection. [...] Although cases of P. skrjabini infection can exhibit early symptoms such as abdominal pain, a lack of appetite, and high fever, it can also come on slowly and fail to exhibit identifiable symptoms for a period of latency between 20 days to as long as 3 months. [...] Later on in the infection, the type of symptoms that appear primarily depends on which organs the P. skrjabini parasites enter. [...] Infections and the resulting set of symptoms can be classified under five different types including the subcutaneous mass type, cerebral type, pericarditis type, abdominal type, and pleurisy type. [...] Infections of the pleurisy type, for instance, exhibit symptoms like chest pain and cough while the cerebral type tends to result in vomiting and headaches. [...] The pericarditis type is associated with shortness of breath and palpitation while the abdominal type infections lead to diarrhea and abdominal pain. [...] P. skrjabini has shown no effect on mammalian reproductive abilities. [...] Despite occasional cases resulting in death, P. skrjabini has not been widely known to cause morbidity and death. [...] Surgery may be occasionally necessary for patients with cerebal or pleural paragonimiasis.|$|E

40|$|A passive <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test,</b> using sheep {{red blood}} cells sensitised with Salmonella typhi lipopolysaccharide, was {{compared}} with the Widal test for the serological diagnosis of typhoid fever in an endemic area. The results obtained on sera from 152 patients with bacteriologically confirmed typhoid and 183 patients {{who did not have}} typhoid were analysed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, and rapidity of the respective tests. The passive <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test</b> was found to be more sensitive (80 %) than the S typhi O antigen (71 %) but marginally less sensitive than the H antigen (82 %) of the Widal test. The false positive rate on control sera was 1. 2 % and 6. 6 %, respectively, for the Widal O and H antigens, and 1. 6 % for the passive <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test.</b> Our findings indicate that the passive <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test</b> is comparable with the Widal test for the serological diagnosis of typhoid fever in endemic areas, but is more simple, rapid, and economic. The passive <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test</b> may be a useful alternative to the Widal test for the serological diagnosis of typhoid fever in busy microbiology laboratories in areas in which the disease is endemic...|$|E

40|$|One hundred sera from 49 {{patients}} with glandular toxoplasmosis were examined by a {{latex agglutination test}}, the dye test, an indirect <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test,</b> and a double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antitoxoplasma IgM. The results support previous findings that the dye test, indirect <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test,</b> and latex agglutination test measure different antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. In early glandular toxoplasmosis, when specific IgM was detected, the titres of both the latex agglutination test and the indirect <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test</b> were lower than the dye test. Repeat specimens from 11 of the patients showed four {{cases in which the}} latex agglutination test titres never exceeded 1 / 256, whereas both the dye test and the indirect <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test</b> showed significant titres and specific IgM was detected in every case. We conclude that the latex agglutination test should not be used as a substitute for the dye test in the serological diagnosis of glandular toxoplasmosis. All sera giving a positive latex agglutination test result should be referred for further tests. A combination of the dye test and double antibody sandwich ELISA gives the most reliable serological diagnosis of early glandular toxoplasmosis...|$|E

40|$|Two {{tests for}} the {{estimation}} of Vi antibody in sera were studied and their validity in the screening of typhoid carriers was assessed. One was a modified Vi <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test</b> in which Vi-coated glutaraldehyde-fixed erythrocytes were used as the antigen and Vi antibody resistant to treatment with 2 -mercaptoethanol was titrated. The other was a fluorescent Vi antibody test in which acetone-fixed bacterial Vi cells were used as the antigen and the total Vi antibody was titrated. In both tests, the antigens used were stable so that standardization of the tests would not be difficult. The modified Vi <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test</b> was found equally sensitive but more specific in giving less false positives than the conventional Vi <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test.</b> The fluorescent Vi antibody test was however found superior to both tests not only in giving less false positives but also in detecting more typhoid carriers...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Fourteen {{laboratories}} {{participated in}} an exteraal quality control survey (EQCS) for antithyroglo-bulin- and antirnicrosomal-antibody determination. Seventeen frozen serum samples from individuals suffer-ing from various thyroid diseases were dispatched by mail. Different test Systems were used by the participants including the <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test,</b> radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and immu-nofluorescence test. The different test results of each participant were sized and could be compared by giving place numbers to each test result. Inter-laboratory quality control was performed by evaluation of a rank correlation coefficient. There was close agreement between the <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test</b> results of antimicroso-mal antibody determination with different test kits, and these tests showed good precision. Antithyroglobulin antibody titers from the two haemagglutination test-kits used, however, were not directly comparable. When sized by place numbers, antithyroglobulin antibody results from <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>test,</b> RIA and ELISA were in close agreement. The least correspondence was shown by the immunofluorescence test, in the antithy-roglobulin antibody determination. This EQCS demonstrates'the necessity of international standardisation {{and the use of}} test Systems which allow quantitative determination of antithyroglobulin- and antimicrosomal-antibody.

40|$|Although the {{haemagglutination}} inhibition assay {{is considered the}} "gold standard" for antigenic characterisation of influenza viruses, some limitations of this technique are well known. A new microneutralisation assay, {{as a tool for}} antigenic characterisation of influenza B viruses, has been standardised and its performance evaluated in comparison with the <b>haemagglutination</b> inhibition <b>test</b> in the light of molecular characterisation of the haemagglutinin. Twelve B viruses belonging to the two lineages and the four sub-lineages discriminated by phylogenetic analysis of HA were tested. The microneutralisation assay clearly distinguishes viruses belonging to different lineages and, in addition, discriminates strains belonging to different sub-lineages that are poorly or not discriminated using the <b>haemagglutination</b> inhibition <b>test.</b> This new microneutralisation assay could provide a useful tool for antigenic characterisation of circulating influenza viruses and contribute, together with the <b>haemagglutination</b> inhibition <b>test</b> and sequence analysis of the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase, in the choice of the strain for use in vaccine composition...|$|R
