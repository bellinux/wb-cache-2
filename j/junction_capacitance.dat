The charging energy and <b>junction</b> <b>capacitances</b> influence the output characteristics sensitively. The MWFs applied on the leads and gate induce novel photon-assisted tunnelling, {{strongly associated with}} the density of states (DOS) of the SWCN leads. The SWCN leads act as quantum wires, and the compound effect induces nonlinear current behavior and resonant tunnelling in a larger region of energy scale. Negative differential conductance (NDC) is clearly observed, as the source-drain <b>junction</b> <b>capacitances</b> C L, and C R are large enough.

5000|$|Another {{complication}} of scaling down is that diodes used in larger scale rectennas cannot operate at THz frequencies without large loss in power. The large loss in {{power is a}} result of the <b>junction</b> <b>capacitance</b> (also known as parasitic capacitance) found in p-n junction diodes and Schottky diodes, which can only operate effectively at frequencies less than 5 THz. [...] The ideal wavelengths of 0.4-1.6 μm correspond to frequencies of approximately 190-750 THz, which is much larger than the capabilities of typical diodes. Therefore, alternative diodes need to be used for efficient power conversion. In current optical rectenna devices, metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunneling diodes are used. Unlike Schottky diodes, MIM diodes are not affected by parasitic capacitances because they work on the basis of electron tunneling. Because of this, MIM diodes have been shown to operate effectively at frequencies around 150 THz.|$|E
