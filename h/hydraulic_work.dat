A sub-set of Glick’s <b>hydraulic</b> <b>work,</b> and the focus of his recent interest, has been the history of water mills, primarily in Valencia. He was the first author writing about medieval Spanish water mills to insist on the crucial distinction (elsewhere universally recognized) between horizontal and vertical mill designs. This simple distinction set off an avalanche of mill research in Spain. At the same time (in the 1990s), because of his involvement in the struggle to save Valencia’s molinological patrimony from destruction, he became an activist in historical preservation and subsequently became president of the Northeast Chapter of the Society for the Preservation of Old Mills and, at the same time, a founder of the Valencian Association of the Friends of Mills. He had for years collected information on the technical knowledge of Moriscos and Marranos, the Muslim and Jewish minorities of early modern Spain and explored the parallelism in their experience as agents of technological diffusion in 1995 article.|$|E

Each circuit must be evaluated and the load cycle estimated. New or modified systems must always be tested in practical work, covering all possible load cycles. An easy way of measuring the actual average power loss in the system is to equip the machine with a test cooler and measure the oil temperature at cooler inlet, oil temperature at cooler outlet and the oil flow through the cooler, when the machine is in normal operating mode. From these figures the test cooler power dissipation can be calculated and this is equal to the power loss when temperatures are stabilized. From this test the actual required cooler can be calculated to reach specified oil temperature in the oil tank. One problem can be to assemble the measuring equipment inline, especially the oil flow meter.|$|E

Huachaques were sunken farms where land was withdrawn to work the moist, sandy soil underneath, an example of which is Tschudi. The Chimú used walk-in wells, {{similar to those of the}} Nazca, to draw water, and reservoirs to contain the water from rivers. This system increased the productivity of the land, which increased Chimú wealth, and likely contributed to the formation of a bureaucratic system.The Chimú cultivated beans, sweet potato, papaya, and cotton with their reservoir and irrigation system. This focus on large-scale irrigation persisted until the Late Intermediate period. At this point, there was a shift to a more specialized system that focused on importing and redistributing resources from satellite communities. [...] There appears to have been a complex network of sites that provided goods and services for Chimú subsistence. Many of these sites produced commodities that the Chimú could not.Many sites relied on marine resources, but after the advent of agriculture, there were more sites further inland, where marine resources were harder to attain. Keeping llamas arose as a supplemental way of attaining meat, but by the Late Intermediate period and Late Horizon, inland sites used llamas as a main resource, although they maintained contact with coastal sites to use supplemental marine resources.They also made masks.|$|E

40|$|Adiponectin {{promotes}} cardioprotection {{by various}} mechanisms, and {{this study used}} primary cardiomyocytes and the isolated working perfused heart to investigate cardiometabolic effects. We show in adult cardiomyocytes that adiponectin increased CD 36 translocation and fatty acid uptake as well as insulin-stimulated glucose transport and Akt phosphorylation. Coimmunoprecipitation showed that adiponectin enhanced association of AdipoR 1 with APPL 1, subsequent binding of APPL 1 with AMPKα 2, which led to phosphorylation and inhibition of ACC and increased fatty acid oxidation. Using siRNA to effectively knockdown APPL 1 in neonatal cardiomyocytes, we demonstrated an essential role for APPL 1 in mediating increased fatty acid uptake and oxidation by adiponectin. Importantly, enhanced fatty acid oxidation in conjunction with AMPK and ACC phosphorylation was also observed in the isolated working heart. Despite increasing fatty acid oxidation and myocardial oxygen consumption, adiponectin increased <b>hydraulic</b> <b>work</b> and maintained cardiac efficiency. In summary, the present study documents several beneficial metabolic effects mediated by adiponectin in the heart and provides novel insight into the mechanisms behind these effects, in particular the importance of APPL 1.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{endotoxin}} on myocardial utilization of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triacylglycerol (TAG) was studied. VLDL was prepared by rat liver perfusion and tested as substrate in the isolated working rat heart. Both liver and heart donor rats were pretreated in vivo with endotoxin or vehicle (control). VLDL-TAG synthesized by endotoxin-pretreated livers was assimilated and oxidized at an increased rate by hearts compared with control VLDL-TAG, {{regardless of the}} cardiac endotoxic status, with increased cardiac mechanical performance (cardiac output, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>work).</b> There was no change in incorporation of labeled VLDL lipids into myocardial tissue lipids. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was increased in endotoxin-pretreated hearts, and after perfusion with "endotoxic" VLDL, there was a tendency for translocation of LPL from tissue-residual to heparin-releasable compartments, but these changes were modest. Analysis of the VLDL composition showed that endotoxin-pretreated livers produced apolipoprotein (apo) -B 48 VLDL with decreased particle size (and hence TAG content), but apo-B 100 VLDL was unchanged. Oleate content of VLDL was increased, {{but there was no}} difference in apo-C or apo-E content.

The chemical composition of dissolved gases indicated that both lake and groundwater are mainly enriched in CO 2. Isotopic analyses suggested a clear volcanic origin for CO 2 dissolved in lake water, while carbon dioxide in groundwater from the Roman emissary is produced by soil respiration. As further confirmed by Oxygen and Deuterium isotopic composition, the Roman emissary drains local suspended aquifers neither in contact with the lake water body nor influenced by volcanic activity, suggesting the opportunity to use the tunnel as a “zero-condition” monitoring site for individuating a possible future renewal of volcanic activity...|$|E

Hearts from obese diabetic and lean littermate control rats were perfused with VLDL and CM from diabetic and control rats. Metabolic fate of the lipoprotein TAG and contractile function were examined. Myocardial utilisation of both VLDL- and CM-TAG was increased in the diabetic state. Diabetic hearts oxidised diabetic lipoprotein-TAG {{to a greater extent than}} control lipoproteins; glucose oxidation was decreased. There was no difference in lipoprotein-TAG assimilation into diabetic heart lipids; diabetic lipoproteins were, however, a poor substrate for control heart tissue lipid accumulation. Although the proportion of exogenous lipid incorporated into tissue TAG was increased in diabetic hearts perfused with control lipoproteins, this effect was not seen in diabetic hearts perfused with diabetic lipoproteins. Myocardial heparin-releasable lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was moderately increased in the diabetic state, and diabetic lipoproteins increased tissue-residual LPL activity. Cardiac <b>hydraulic</b> <b>work</b> was decreased only in diabetic hearts perfused with diabetic CM. Compositional analysis of diabetic variant lipoproteins indicated changes in size and apoprotein content.
