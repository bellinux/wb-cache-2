40|$|The study applies two {{approaches}} for {{the estimation of}} the social costs of main payment instruments (cash, debit card and credit card transactions, <b>credit</b> <b>transfers,</b> direct debits, business-to-business direct debits, postal inpayment money orders, postal outpayment money orders for pensions) used in Hungary in 2009. The first approach {{is based on the}} current payment structure, while the second approach is based on a more modern, hypothetical payment structure involving less cash, with no use of paper-based methods. In the first approach, the social cost amounts to HUF 388 billion, i. e. 1. 49 % of the GDP, while in the second approach, such cost amounts to HUF 285 billion, i. e. 1. 09 % of the GDP. In this context, social cost means the use of all resources (time, materials and money) necessary for the execution of payments, calculated as a net value (i. e. exclusive of fees paid for payment services). Thus, HUF 103 billion could be saved in social costs if the use of payment instruments were to be modified. private cost, social cost, net private cost, unit cost, social savings, cash transactions, debit card transactions, credit card transactions, paper-based <b>credit</b> <b>transfers,</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>credit</b> <b>transfers,</b> direct debits, business-to-business direct debits, postal inpayment money orders, postal outpayment money orders for pensions...|$|R

Trust is necessary for Grid participants in a business environment. It is also necessary to support the dynamic manner of real markets. As distinguished function, in opposite to existing mechanisms as GSI/CAS/VOMS, gSET allows the user to obtain access to a service without disclosing his credentials to the service provider. This minimizes the service provider’s administrative effort needed for user account management. gSET consists of Grid Services implemented with WSRF/GT 4. gSET is an enabling step to make Grids a platform for commercial workflows. ...|$|R

Payment methods consist of cash, cheques, debit cards, credit cards, charge cards, <b>electronic</b> purse and <b>credit</b> <b>transfer.</b> This study focus on a credit card as the use of credit cards as a medium of exchange for commercial, business and social purchases is ubiquitous. Credit card market in Malaysia also shows an increasing trend in term of its volume of usage and number of card possessed. Credit card is a card whose holder has been granted a revolving credit line. In this study, our respondents come from staffs in Universiti Utara Malaysia. A survey method has been adopted in finding information on the respondents via questionnaires. A three-section questionnaire was developed to find the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents, the possession of credit card and the usage of credit card among them. All the information from 117 respondents then analyzed using the descriptive method to reflect respondent’s demographic and socioeconomic data together with their possession and usage of credit card...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} policy approaches to payment systems efficiency in the SEACEN countries. Two major findings were as follows. First, cash remained a dominant payment method in {{a majority of}} SEACEN countries. A declining trend, however, was found in three countries ¨C Korea, Singapore and Taiwan - where existing empirical data suggested a shift towards the use of more efficiency-enhancing cashless transactions such as debit cards, <b>credit</b> cards and <b>electronic</b> <b>credit</b> <b>transfers.</b> Using pooled data from four countries for the period 1995 - 2002, results indicated the following: use of cashless transactions increased with the rise in per capita income; use of cash transactions was negatively co-related {{with the use of}} cheque and debit card transactions; an increase in ATM terminals was negatively co-related with the use of cashless transactions, suggesting a rise in cash withdrawals; and an increase in crime rates is positively correlated with {{an increase in the number}} of cheque and credit card transactions. Second, total investment cost in payment and settlement systems amounted to approximately USD 28 million for the period 2000 - 2004. These investments were largely for the development and enhancement of real-time gross settlement systems. Survey data suggests that a majority of payment systems did not fully recover cost. Subsidies amounted to approximately USD 3. 7 million in 2003. Unit cost recovery ratios also suggest that transaction fees did not fully recover unit cost in a majority of the payment systems. This can be explained by three reasons: periodical price schedule reviews were lacking; payment revenues relied largely on transaction fees; and the structure of transaction fees are largely flat. Using pooled data for 21 large-value payment systems for the period 2001 - 2003, results indicated that the average unit cost demonstrated an L-shaped curve where the predicted unit costs can fall from USD 3 to USD 0. 40 in the shift from small-scale to large-scale operations. This suggests relatively strong scale economies and payment systems efficiency. While there are arguments in favor of subsidization, as payment systems are viewed as a public good, there are also arguments in favor of cost-based pricing to prevent price distortions and payment market failure. Therefore, the key challenge for the central bank is to strike a balance between the risk-cost tradeoff objectives it pursues. The role of the central bank in promoting payment systems efficiency is two-fold. The first role focuses on market guidance. This involves encouraging the public to shift from the use of cash to more efficiency-enhancing cashless transactions. This may be achieved through the co-operation of payment associations, banking associations, or the banking industry in general as retail payment services are largely owned and operated by the private sector. The second role focuses on a four-step process to improve the efficiency of central bank payment services in the following areas: collection of cost and revenue data; forecasting of demand; formulation of pricing strategy; and review of price schedule. ...|$|R
