25|$|James Henry Rand Jr. (November 18, 1886 – June 3, 1968) was an American {{industrialist}} who {{revolutionized the}} business record industry. He founded American <b>Kardex,</b> an office equipment and office supplies firm which later merged with his father's company, the Rand Ledger Corporation. Rand later bought out and merged {{with several other}} companies, notably the Remington Typewriter Company, to form Remington Rand. In 1955, Rand merged his corporation with the Sperry Corporation to form Sperry-Rand, {{one of the earliest}} and largest computer manufacturing companies in the United States.|$|E
25|$|James Rand Jr. soon {{took the}} company on a buying spree. The company became the largest {{supplier}} of office furniture in the world through its 1926 acquisition of Globe Wernicke Co., but was forced to divest itself of the business later that year after an antitrust action. Between 1927 and 1929, the company merged with or bought {{out a number of}} companies, including Index Visible, Inc. (which had been founded by Yale University economist Irving Fisher), Safe-Cabinet Co. (which had invented the fire-proof safe), Library Bureau, Inc. (which had invented the filing cabinet), Dalton Adding Machine and Baker-Vawter Ledger. For a brief time in 1926, the company was known as Rand <b>Kardex</b> Bureau, Inc. In 1927, James Rand Jr. merged his company with the Remington Typewriter Co. (which had invented the noiseless and electric typewriters) and changed its name to Remington Rand. Company sales grew from $5 million in 1927 to $500 million in 1954.|$|E

It has been suggested that one result of his action may have been to undermine the confidence and trust of patients and that his campaign was misguided and political.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} (NSAID) prescribing {{practices in}} a tertiary referral hospital. METHODS: A single time-point audit of drug <b>kardexes</b> and clinical notes of n = 388 patients on 2 July 2008 was carried out assessing demographics, gastrointestinal and coronary heart disease risk factors, renal function and co-prescribed medications. RESULTS: Fifty-seven of 388 (14. 7 %) hospital patients were on NSAIDs. Forty-nine were prescribed NSAID after admission. Nineteen (32. 2 %) were on regular NSAID (11 / 19 on PPI) and 38 patients were on PRN NSAID (12 / 38 on PPI). Seventeen of 49 patients were on other medications associated with gastrointestinal bleeding (10 / 17 were on PPI). Nineteen patients (33. 3 %) were > 60 years. Eight patients had three or four risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding; six were on PPI. Thirteen patients had two risks; 7 were on PPI. Six of 19 patients with one risk factor were on PPI. 40. 3 % had stage 2 / 3 chronic kidney disease. 35. 1 % had ischaemic heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: NSAIDs and PPIs are often prescribed inappropriately...|$|R
