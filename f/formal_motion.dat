25|$|On 9 December 1999, Liverpool City Council {{passed a}} <b>formal</b> <b>motion</b> apologizing for the City's {{part in the}} slave trade. It was {{unanimously}} agreed that Liverpool acknowledges its responsibility for its involvement in three centuries of the slave trade. The City Council has made an unreserved apology for Liverpool's involvement and the continual effect of slavery on Liverpool's Black communities.|$|E
500|$|On September 12, George Mason of Virginia {{suggested}} {{the addition of}} a Bill of Rights to the Constitution modeled on previous state declarations, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts made it a <b>formal</b> <b>motion.</b> However, the motion was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations after only a brief discussion. Madison, then an opponent of a Bill of Rights, later explained the vote by calling the state bills of rights [...] "parchment barriers" [...] that offered only an illusion of protection against tyranny. Another delegate, James Wilson of Pennsylvania, later argued that the act of enumerating the rights of the people would have been dangerous, because it would imply that rights not explicitly mentioned did not exist; Hamilton echoed this point in Federalist No. 84. Because Mason and Gerry had emerged as opponents of the proposed new Constitution, their motion—introduced five days {{before the end of the}} convention—may also have been seen by other delegates as a delaying tactic. The quick rejection of this motion, however, later endangered the entire ratification process. Author David O. Stewart characterizes the omission of a Bill of Rights in the original Constitution as [...] "a political blunder of the first magnitude" [...] while historian Jack N. Rakove calls it [...] "the one serious miscalculation the framers made as they looked ahead to the struggle over ratification".|$|E
2500|$|In 1961 and 1962, Finley {{talked to}} people in Dallas-Fort Worth and a four-man group {{appeared}} before American League owners, but no <b>formal</b> <b>motion</b> was put forward to move the team to Texas. In January 1964, he signed an agreement to move the A's to Louisville, promising to change the team's name to the [...] "Kentucky Athletics". (Other names suggested for the team were the [...] "Louisville Sluggers" [...] and [...] "Kentucky Colonels", which would have allowed the team to keep the letters [...] "KC" [...] on their uniforms.) The owners turned it down by a 9-1 margin, with Finley being the only one voting in favor. Six weeks later, by the same 9–1 margin, the A.L. owners denied Finley's request to move the team to Oakland.|$|E

60|$|Notwithstanding {{the formal}} {{renunciation}} {{of the leadership}} of the Protectionist party by Lord George Bentinck, it was soon evident to the House and the country that that renunciation was merely formal. In these days of labour, the leader of a party must be the man who does the work, and that work cannot now be accomplished without the devotion of a life. Whenever a great question arose, the people out of doors went to Lord George Bentinck, and when the discussion commenced, he was always found to be the man armed with the authority of knowledge. There was, however, no organized debate and no party discipline. No one was requested to take a part, and no attendance was ever summoned. The vast majority sitting on the Protectionist benches always followed Bentinck, who, whatever might be his numbers in the lobby, always made a redoubtable stand in the House. The situation however, it cannot be denied, was a dangerous one for a great party to persevere in, but no permanent damage accrued, because almost every one hoped that before the session was over, the difficulty would find a natural solution in the virtual chief resuming his formal and responsible post. Notwithstanding his labours on the two great committees of the year--those on colonial and commercial distress,--Lord George Bentinck found time to master the case of the shipping interest when the navigation laws were attacked, to impugn in a <b>formal</b> <b>motion</b> the whole of the commercial policy of Sir Robert Peel, even while the sugar and coffee planting committee was still sitting, and to produce, early in March, a rival budget. It was mainly through the prolonged resistance which he organized against the repeal of the navigation laws, that the government, in 1848, was forced to abandon their project. The resistance was led with great ability by Mr. Herries, and the whole party put forward their utmost strength to support him. But {{it is very difficult to}} convey a complete picture of the laborious life of Lord George Bentinck during the sitting of Parliament. At half-past nine o'clock there called upon him the commercial representatives of the question of the day; after these conferences came his elaborate and methodical correspondence, all of which he carried on himself in a handwriting clear as print, and never employing a secretary; at twelve or one o'clock he was at a committee, and he only left the committee-room to take his seat in the House of Commons, which he never quitted till the House adjourned, always long past midnight, and often at two o'clock in the morning. Here he was ready for all comers, never omitting an opportunity to vindicate his opinions, or watching with lynx-like vigilance the conduct of a public office. What was not his least remarkable trait is, that although he only breakfasted on dry toast, he took no sustenance all this time, dining at White's at half-past two o'clock in the morning. After his severe attack of the influenza he broke through this habit a little during the last few months of his life, moved by the advice of his physician and the instance of his friends. The writer of these observations prevailed upon him a little the last year to fall into the easy habit of dining at Bellamy's, which saves much time, and permits the transaction of business in conversation with a congenial friend. But he grudged it: he always thought that something would be said or done in his absence, which would not have occurred had he been there; some motion whisked through, or some return altered. His principle was that a member should never be absent from his seat.|$|E

25|$|A {{letter from}} the ACT branch to the RAOU Council meeting in July 1966 {{strongly}} criticised the standard of the Emu, the administrative disorder and the passivity regarding conservation and field studies. It finished by proposing two <b>formal</b> <b>motions</b> to (i) adopt active policies for organising research, publicity and education, and to (ii) set up a committee to implement the former. Subsequently, in September 1966 such a reform committee was appointed under the chairmanship of Keith Hindwood.

However, an informal letter of confidence organised by his supporters in February 2006 attracted around 50 signatories from Members of Congregation.

5000|$|Sittings of the House {{are open}} to the public, but the House may at any time vote to sit in private, which has {{occurred}} only twice since 1950. Traditionally, a Member who desired that the House sit privately could shout [...] "I spy strangers" [...] and a vote would automatically follow. In the past, when relations between the Commons and the Crown were less than cordial, this procedure was used whenever the House wanted to keep its debate private. More often, however, this device was used to delay and disrupt proceedings; as a result, it was abolished in 1998. Now, Members seeking that the House sit in private must make a <b>formal</b> <b>motion</b> to that effect.|$|E

5000|$|As {{more than}} one {{candidate}} was nominated, the House voted by secret ballot in order of preference after the candidates' speeches, with an absolute majority required for victory. As no candidate won a majority on first preferences, the individual with the fewest votes was eliminated and their votes redistributed {{in accordance with their}} next highest preference, under a voting system known as the alternative vote (misleadingly described in Dáil standing orders as the [...] "proportional representation single transferable vote"). Eliminations and redistributions continued until one member received the requisite absolute majority. Then, the House voted on a <b>formal</b> <b>motion</b> to appoint the member in question to the position of Ceann Comhairle.

5000|$|Generally, in {{a meeting}} of a deliberative assembly, {{business}} is conducted using a <b>formal</b> procedure of <b>motion,</b> debate, and vote.

The procedure of asking for unanimous consent is used to expedite business by eliminating the need for formal votes on routine questions in which the existence of a consensus is likely. The principle behind it is that procedural safeguards designed to protect a minority can be waived when there is no minority to protect.|$|R
