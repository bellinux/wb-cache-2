5|$|A {{number of}} {{scientific}} organizations {{headed by the}} European Southern Observatory (ESO) organized a network of amateur astronomers and students to measure Earth's distance from the Sun during the transit. The participants' observations allowed a calculation of the astronomical unit (AU) of 149,608,708km ± 11,835km which <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> 0.007% difference to the accepted value.|$|E

5|$|Between April and May 1996, Hoffman {{appeared}} at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in a Mark Wing-Davey production of Caryl Churchill's The Skriker. Following this, based on his work in Scent of a Woman, he was cast by writer–director Paul Thomas Anderson to appear in his debut feature Hard Eight (1996). Hoffman <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> brief role in the crime thriller, playing a cocksure young craps player, but it began the most important collaboration of his career.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{joined a}} {{shrunken}} and demoralized Conservative caucus in the House of Commons. The Conservative leader, Robert Manion, {{failed to win}} {{a place in the}} Commons in the election, which saw the Liberals take 181 seats. The Tories sought to be included in a wartime coalition government, but Mackenzie King refused. The House of Commons <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> slight role in the war effort; under the state of emergency, most business was accomplished through the Cabinet issuing Orders in Council.|$|E
5|$|During {{his primary}} victories, McGovern used an {{approach}} that stressed grassroots-level organization while bypassing conventional campaign techniques and traditional party power centers. He capitalized on support from anti-war activists and reform liberals; thousands of students engaged in door-to-door campaigning for him. He benefited by the eight primaries he won being those the press focused on the most; he showed electoral weakness in the South and industrial Midwest, and actually received fewer primary votes overall than Humphrey and <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> modest edge over Wallace.|$|E

In addition to the albums, Episode I saw the release of a book of orchestral sheet music as well as a book of piano sheet music; Episode II <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> book of piano sheet music. Music from the series has been played multiple times in concerts, especially that of the first two games.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 the Cheshire County League {{merged with}} the Lancashire Combination to form the new North West Counties League, where Leek spent five {{relatively}} unsuccessful seasons. During their spell in this league former England player Mike Pejic took over as manager, Leek's most high-profile appointment to date, but he <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> short reign before moving to Northwich Victoria. Following Kevin Lewis' brief reign Neil Baker took over in 1986 and was to lead the club to some of its greatest successes to date.|$|E
5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to prevent armed battle and to avert the {{resulting}} political crisis, U.S. President Andrew Jackson consulted his Attorney General, Benjamin Butler, for his legal opinion on the border dispute. At the time, Ohio was a growing political power in the Union, with nineteen U.S. representatives and two senators. In contrast, Michigan, still being a territory, <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> single non-voting delegate. Ohio was a crucial swing state in presidential elections, {{and it would have been}} devastating to the fledgling Democratic Party to lose Ohio's electoral votes. Therefore, Jackson calculated that his party's best interest would be served by keeping the Toledo Strip a part of Ohio.|$|E

5|$|On 30 April 1969, the Working Committee for Nuclear Issues (AAA) was created. It met 27 {{times between}} 26 September 1969 and 25 October 1988. However, the {{committee}} <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> preparatory role. As the Cold War started {{coming to an}} end, the AAA became less relevant. On 1 November 1988, Federal Councillor Arnold Koller signed the dissolution order, and the AAA ceased to exist on 31 December of that year, thus ending the 43-year Swiss nuclear weapons program.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{has limited}} {{self-government}} within the United Kingdom, {{as well as}} representation in the UK Parliament. Executive and legislative powers respectively have been devolved to the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh since 1999. The UK Parliament retains control over reserved matters specified in the Scotland Act 1998, including UK taxes, social security, defence, international relations and broadcasting. The Scottish Parliament has legislative authority for all other areas relating to Scotland. It initially <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> limited power to vary income tax, but powers over taxation and social security were significantly expanded by the Scotland Acts of 2012 and 2016.|$|E

5|$|The Axis {{threat to}} Australia {{developed}} gradually and until 1942 {{was limited to}} sporadic attacks by German armed merchantmen. The level of Axis naval activity peaked {{in the first half}} of 1942 when Japanese submarines conducted anti-shipping patrols off Australia's coast, and Japanese naval aviation attacked several towns in northern Australia. The Japanese submarine offensive against Australia was renewed {{in the first half of}} 1943 but was broken off as the Allies pushed the Japanese onto the defensive. Few Axis naval vessels operated in Australian waters in 1944 and 1945, and those that did <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> limited impact.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers forced four {{turnovers}} {{and held}} Bears running back Walter Payton to 24yards on 15 carries, but the offense, who also committed four turnovers, was ineffective. One of Payton's runs was a 1-yard touchdown that broke Jim Brown's all-time record of 106 touchdowns. Payton also caught a 9-yard touchdown pass that clinched {{the game with}} 3:20 remaining. The Buccaneers <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> field goal to show for four possessions inside the Bears' 30-yard line. Vinny Testaverde made his NFL debut after Steve DeBerg left {{the game in the}} fourth quarter with a sprained medial collateral ligament.|$|E
5|$|The Reform Act's chief {{objective}} was {{the reduction of}} the number of nomination boroughs. There were 203 boroughs in England before the Act. The 56 smallest of these, as measured by their housing stock and tax assessments, were completely abolished. The next 30 smallest boroughs each lost one of their two MPs. In addition Weymouth and Melcombe Regis's four members were reduced to two. Thus in total the Act abolished 143 borough seats in England (one of the boroughs to be completely abolished, Higham Ferrers, <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> single representative).|$|E
