5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The {{cartoonist}} was reluctant, stating that the original plates for the story were now in a poor condition and {{that as a result}} he would have to redraw the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E

5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls {{aim to make}} their way to the Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Living.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1916, J. Grossman's Sons {{contacted}} American jazz composers Peter DeRose and Ivan Reid {{to write}} a song about Grapico. DeRose, who would later {{be inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame, produced the piano accompanied song, Meet Me <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Grapico. Meet Me <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Grapico is a sentimental ballad from Tin Pan Alley that imagined a faraway Land of Grapico where love lives forever. The song (see below) and its cover sheet alluded to a grape vine-covered arbor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Grapico, even though Grapico contained no grape juice. Dedicating the song to all the drinkers of Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons published the song in 1916 and provided it free on request.|$|E

From December 1945 to May 1946 it then appeared in a youth supplement to the newspaper La Voix de l'Ouest under the title of Tintin et Milou au pays de l'or liquide ("Tintin and Snowy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Liquid Gold").|$|E

5|$|Eskimo was not {{the first}} {{dramatic}} film to use an all-native cast for the native roles; that was the 1914 silent film <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Head Hunters.

Ray Mala became nationally famous for his work in Eskimo, and subsequently had a long career as a lead and supporting actor in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Following on from Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Soviets and {{bolstered by}} {{publicity}} stunts, Tintin in the Congo was a commercial success within Belgium {{and was also}} serialised in France. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in America in 1932, and the series subsequently became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1946, Hergé re-drew and coloured Tintin in the Congo in his distinctive ligne-claire style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made {{at the request of}} his Scandinavian publisher for a 1975 edition.|$|E

5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{thought that}} The Black Island linked to Hergé's other Adventures in various ways; he {{connected}} the counterfeit {{money in the}} story to the counterfeit idol in The Broken Ear and the fake bunker in Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Soviets. He also connected Tintin's solving of the puzzle in the airman's jacket to his solving of the pirate puzzles in The Secret of the Unicorn, and that in transmitting from a place of death, Ben Mor, or mort (death), it linked to Tintin's transmitting from the crypt of Marlinspike Hall in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E
