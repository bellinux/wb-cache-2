5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, {{it is imperative that}} the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and <b>harms)</b> such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential <b>harms,</b> a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential <b>harms</b> and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E

50|$|Mill's <b>harm</b> {{principle}} {{is distinct from}} the offence principle. The basis of comparison is that, in some cases, psychological or social <b>harm</b> may be comparable to physical <b>harm.</b> The difference {{is based on the}} assumption that offence may cause discomfort, but does not necessarily cause <b>harm.</b> Offence meets the <b>harm</b> principle only if it is a wrong and also causes <b>harm.</b>|$|R
50|$|However, {{the second}} maxim also opens the {{question}} of broader definitions of <b>harm,</b> {{up to and including}} <b>harm</b> to the society. The concept of <b>harm</b> is not limited to <b>harm</b> to another individual but can be <b>harm</b> to individuals plurally, without specific definition of those individuals.|$|R
50|$|Along similar {{lines as}} Mill, Jasper Doomen {{has argued that}} <b>harm</b> should be defined {{from the point of}} view of the {{individual}} citizen, not limiting <b>harm</b> to physical <b>harm</b> since nonphysical <b>harm</b> may also be involved; Feinbergs distinction between <b>harm</b> and offense is criticized as largely trivial.|$|R
5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} <b>harms</b> its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{jurisprudence}} signifies {{a reaction}} to the philosophical approach of modern legal scholars, who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals.

50|$|A risk is {{the amount}} of <b>harm</b> that can be {{expected}} to occur during a given time period due to specific <b>harm</b> event (e.g., an accident). Statistically, the level of risk can be calculated as the product of the probability that <b>harm</b> occurs (e.g., that an accident happens) multiplied by the severity of that <b>harm</b> (i.e., the average amount of <b>harm</b> or more conservatively the maximum credible amount of <b>harm).</b> In practice, the risk matrix is a useful approach where either the probability nor <b>harm</b> severity can not be estimated with accuracy and precision.|$|R

5|$|Heins {{demonstrates}} how lawmakers {{in other states}} used the Ginsberg v. New York ruling to increase morality-based censorship of material from children.

The author explains the dangers in allowing the government to determine appropriate material for youth to view, {{pointing out that the}} belief in sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven. Heins notes that the fear of this impact is used to support morality-based arguments, and appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually <b>harms</b> them through the censorship itself.|$|E

40|$|The total social <b>harm</b> {{caused by}} {{everyone}} is often verifiable, and the <b>harm</b> that each actor causes is often unverifiable. In these circumstances, the authorities lack the information necessary {{to implement the}} usual liability rules or externality taxes. We propose a novel solution: hold each participant in the activity responsible {{for all of the}} excessive <b>harm</b> that everyone causes. By excessive <b>harm</b> we mean the difference between the total <b>harm</b> caused by all injurers and the optimal total <b>harm.</b> We show that the rule of total liability for excessive <b>harm</b> creates incentives for efficient precaution and activity level. Consequently, actual <b>harm</b> is not excessive and actual liability is nil. The authorities gain control over social <b>harm</b> without having to monitor individuals, and individuals do not have to pay damages or conform to bureaucratic regulations. This rule has many practical advantages, especially in cases involving <b>harm</b> to the environment. ...|$|R
5|$|It {{rejects the}} Christian {{emphasis}} on sin and guilt, believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing {{that if an}} individual adopts these negative attitudes it <b>harms</b> their own spiritual evolution. Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature. Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a white light.|$|E
5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that <b>harms</b> others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E

5|$|The Joker is {{alternatively}} {{depicted as}} sexual and asexual. In The Dark Knight Returns and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker is seductive toward Batman; {{it is uncertain}} if their relationship has homoerotic undertones or if the Joker is simply trying to manipulate his nemesis. Frank Miller interpreted the character as fixated on death and uninterested in sexual relationships, while Robinson believes that the Joker is capable of a romantic relationship. His relationship with Harley Quinn is abusively paradoxical; although the Joker keeps her at his side, he heedlessly <b>harms</b> her (for example, throwing her out a window without seeing if she survives). Harley loves him but the Joker does not reciprocate her feelings, chiding her for distracting him from other plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{documents}} {{most often}} cited to justifying {{the elimination of}} Native mascots are the advisory opinion by the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005.

However, the issue is often discussed in the media in terms of feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and {{context of the use}} of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated.|$|E
5|$|The {{story and}} cut scene {{animations}} were created in-house. The plot was originally written by Fox, {{who had also}} written most of the Sly Cooper stories, and reviewed by Fleming. As they continued to develop the game, they rewrote pieces of the story to reflect changes in the game, {{making sure that the}} story remained enjoyable. As the game became more complex, they brought in Bill <b>Harms,</b> a published comic book author, who had previously written for Supreme Commander and other video games. <b>Harms</b> assisted with the story and in-game dialog in addition to marketing materials. Fleming noted that {{the second half of the}} story underwent significant changes in the last nine months of development; for example, when voice actor Caleb Moody voiced the lines for Zeke, he ad libbed additional lines that the team found to be enjoyable, and they reworked the story to incorporate them. The cut scenes were created in a similar format to the comics that the game was influenced by, and used to further extend the atmosphere of the superhero motif. The cut scenes were created by taking 2D art created in Corel Painter and Adobe Photoshop and placing them into artificial 3D stages built in Adobe After Effects to create a pseudo-3D effect that allowed them to play with camera placement and effects, and addition of organic elements such as dust clouds and ink spots.|$|E

40|$|There is {{evidence}} suggesting that self <b>harm</b> among young people is beginning earlier, in childhood and adolescent years. This paper reports on a qualitative study of primary school staff responses to self <b>harm</b> among children.

Instead, the authors advocate policy‐level initiatives proactively addressing self <b>harm,</b> as has happened in sex and drug education.
