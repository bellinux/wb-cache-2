50|$|Weeds are {{the major}} biotic {{stresses}} for finger millet cultivation. Its seeds are very small, {{which leads to a}} relatively slow development in early growing stages. This makes finger millet a weak competitor for light, water and nutrients compared with weeds. In East and Southern Africa, the closely related species Eleusine indica (common name Indian goose grass) is a severe weed competitor of finger millet. Especially in early growing stages of the crop and the weed and when broadcast seeding instead of row seeding is applied (as often the case in East Africa), the two species are very difficult to distinguish. Besides Eleusine indica, the species Xanthium strumarium, which is animal disperesed and the stolon-owning species Cyperus rotondus and Cynodon dactylon are important finger millet weeds. Measures to control weeds include cultural, physical and chemical methods. Cultural methods could be sowing in rows instead of broadcast sowing in order to make distinction between finger millet seedlings and Eleusine indica easier when hand weeding. ICRISAT promotes cover crops and crop rotations to discrupt the growing cycle of the weeds. Physical weed control in financial resource limited communities growing finger millet are mainly hand weeding or weeding with a <b>hand</b> <b>hoe.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{technical}} specifications for cultivating desho {{are essential to}} improve grazing land management practices. Cuts of the grass are ideally planted in rows, spaced at 10 cm by 10 cm, using a <b>hand</b> <b>hoe.</b> This spacing gives each plant sufficient soil nutrients and access to sunlight to achieve optimal growth, while ensuring the soil will be completely covered by the grass once established. It is recommended to plant other species alongside desho to promote biodiversity. Multipurpose shrubs/trees, for example Leucaena sp and Sesbania sp, can be planted approximately 5 m apart with no particular layout. Other legumes, such as alfalfa and clover, can be mixed in with desho by being broadcast throughout the plot. [...] Once planted, maintenance activities such as applying fertilizer, weeding and gap filling, ensure proper establishment and persistence of desho. Fertilizer should be applied throughout the plot one month after planting. It is recommended to use organic compost {{in the form of}} animal manure, leaf litter, wood ash, food scraps, and/or any other rich biodegradable matters. After this initial treatment, fertilizer is only applied sporadically when desho plants are struggling to grow or where replanting has taken place. Weeding and gap filling are continuous activities. However, after 2 to 3 years, maintenance inputs decrease substantially or cease altogether as the grass cover closes up and the plot becomes a sustainable fodder source.|$|E

Due to the heterogeneous nature of farmers' resource base, the farms were grouped into three farm types: high (Type 1), medium (Type 2) and poorly resourced farmers (Type 3). The <b>hand</b> <b>hoe</b> weeded treatments had 49 percent higher total weed densities in CT relative to CONV, and was statistically similar to the glyphosate treatment. The mixed pre-emergence herbicides reduced the diversity indices by 69 and 70 percent {{when compared to the}} <b>hand</b> <b>hoe</b> weeded treatment under CT in cotton and maize, respectively. The effectiveness of all pre-emergence herbicides were not influenced by tillage but were affected by farmers resource endowments with pronounced effect in Farm Type 1.

40|$|In South Kivu (RD-Congo), Rwanda and Burundi, bananas (AAA-EA, Musa spp.) are {{frequently}} intercropped with annual crops, of which common bush beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) {{are the most}} common. At the onset of each rainy season, the soil in between the bananas is tilled manually using a <b>hand</b> <b>hoe</b> or a fork up to 10 - 15 cm depth to prepare the seedbed. Farmers believe that tillage favors the bean performance, {{but it may also}} seriously damage the superficial banana root system. This may negatively affect banana productivity and nematode and fungal disease pressure on banana roots. The aim of the research was {{to assess the impact of}} tillage on the banana root systems and growth 12 months after the application of no-till. We monitored characteristics of primary roots (biomass, length, nematode infection rate) in the topsoil (0 - 20 cm) on a monthly basis for a 6 months period in three on-farm trials. Mature banana plantations were subjected to no-till, tillage using a hoe, and tillage using a forked hoe. The latter was to test whether the fork would cause less damage to the root systems than conventional tillage. Immediately after tillage, <b>hand</b> <b>hoe</b> tillage reduced the root biomass by 85 % on average in the top 10 cm compared to no-till plots, with no significant differences between tillage methods. There was no effect of tillage below this depth. Both in terms of length and biomass, roots recovered within 2 to 3 months to levels similar to no-till plots in a radius of 45 cm around the tree. Nematode infection rates were similar across treatments. Pseudo-stem volume of the banana trees did not differ significantly between tilled and no-till plots during the trial period. <b>Hand</b> <b>hoe</b> and fork affected at the same level the banana root system in the top 10 cm. We conclude that tillage strongly, but temporarily, damages the banana root system in the top 10 cm, which represents 24 - 50 % of the total root biomass between 0 and 20 cm depth. The decrease in root length and biomass in the topsoil may have adverse effects on the banana productivity, but longer term monitoring is required to quantify these effects on yield.

The combined effects of tillage and manure application on Lixisol properties and on crop performance were investigated at Saria, Burkina Faso, to find efficient soil management practices to improve soil fertility. A randomized block design with four treatments (hand hoeing only, hand hoeing+manure, ploughing only, oxen ploughing+manure) in three replications was started in 1990. Ten years later, total soil organic (SOC), particulate organic matter and C mineralization were measured. Initial SOC concentration was 4 mg/g and dropped to 2. 1 mg/g soil in ploughed plots without manure and to 2. 5 mg/g soil in hoed plots without manure. Manure addition mitigated the decrease of SOC in ploughed plots and even built up SOC in hoed plots, where it increased to 5. 8 mg/g soil. Manure had a large effect on the fractions in which SOC was stored. In ploughed plots, a large amount of SOC was stored in physical particles > 0. 25 mm, while in <b>hand</b> <b>hoed</b> plots the maximum SOC was stored in finer fractions.

The second one was to highlight the opportunities and challenges of CA technology on food security in the district. The last objective was to assess CA attribution to food security in Gokwe South district. CA is a farming system or practice which aims to conserve soil, labour and water by using blanket cover (mulch) to minimise runoff and improve the conditions for plant establishment and growth.
