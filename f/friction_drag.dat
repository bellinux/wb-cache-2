500|$|The laminar {{boundary}} is a {{very smooth}} flow, while the turbulent boundary layer contains swirls or [...] "eddies." [...] The laminar flow creates less skin <b>friction</b> <b>drag</b> than the turbulent flow, but is less stable. Boundary layer flow over a wing surface begins as a smooth laminar flow. As the flow continues back from the leading edge, the laminar boundary layer increases in thickness.|$|E
500|$|In {{high-performance}} designs, such as gliders {{and commercial}} aircraft, much {{attention is paid}} to controlling the behavior of the boundary layer to minimize drag. [...] Two effects have to be considered. First, the boundary layer adds to the effective thickness of the body, through the displacement thickness, hence increasing the pressure drag.

2500|$|According to {{scientific}} consensus, {{the occurrence of}} the paradox {{is due to the}} neglected effects of viscosity. [...] In conjunction with scientific experiments, there were huge advances in the theory of viscous fluid friction during the 19th century. With respect to the paradox, this culminated in the discovery and description of thin boundary layers by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904. Even at very high Reynolds numbers, the thin boundary layers remain as a result of viscous forces. [...] These viscous forces cause <b>friction</b> <b>drag</b> on streamlined objects, and for [...] bodies the additional result is flow separation and a low-pressure wake behind the object, leading to form drag.|$|E

2500|$|The V.2 was a {{cantilever}} mid wing monoplane. Its all wood wings {{were built}} with multicellular construction around two parallel spars and the surfaces sanded and lacquered to reduce <b>friction</b> <b>drag.</b> In plan the wings were straight tapered, {{mostly on the}} trailing edge, with oblique tips. [...] The ailerons were near triangular, reaching to the wing tips; there were no flaps. [...] Aluminium fairings blended the wing roots into the fuselage; similar fairings were used at the elevator roots. [...] The elevators had straight, swept leading edges and were set {{at the top of}} the fuselage. [...] They carried separate elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement. [...] The latter was wide and almost rectangular, its upper edge blending into an almost triangular, wide chord fin.|$|E
2500|$|The German {{physicist}} Ludwig Prandtl {{suggested in}} 1904 {{that the effects}} of a thin viscous boundary layer possibly could be the source of substantial drag. [...] Prandtl put forward the idea that, at high velocities and high Reynolds numbers, a no-slip boundary condition causes a strong variation of the flow speeds over a thin layer near the wall of the body. This leads to the generation of vorticity and viscous dissipation of kinetic energy in the boundary layer. The energy dissipation, which is lacking in the inviscid theories, results for bluff bodies in separation of the flow. The low pressure in the wake region causes form drag, and this can be larger than the <b>friction</b> <b>drag</b> due to the viscous shear stress at the wall.|$|E
2500|$|Animal {{locomotion}} requires {{energy to}} overcome various forces including <b>friction,</b> <b>drag,</b> inertia and gravity, although {{the influence of}} these depends on the circumstances. In terrestrial environments, gravity must be overcome whereas the drag of air has little influence. In aqueous environments, friction (or drag) becomes the major energetic challenge with gravity being less of an influence. Remaining in the aqueous environment, animals with natural buoyancy expend little energy to maintain a vertical position in a water column. Others naturally sink, and must spend energy to remain afloat. Drag is also an energetic influence in flight, and the aerodynamically efficient body shapes of flying birds indicate how they have evolved to cope with this. [...] Limbless organisms moving on land must energetically overcome surface friction, however, they do not usually need to expend significant energy to counteract gravity.|$|E

2500|$|Prandtl {{made the}} {{hypothesis}} that the viscous effects are important in thin layers – called boundary layers – adjacent to solid boundaries, and that viscosity has no role of importance outside. [...] The boundary-layer thickness becomes smaller when the viscosity reduces. [...] The full problem of viscous flow, described by the non-linear Navier–Stokes equations, is in general not mathematically solvable. [...] However, using his hypothesis (and backed up by experiments) Prandtl was able to derive an approximate model for the flow inside the boundary layer, called boundary-layer theory; while the flow outside the boundary layer could be treated using inviscid flow theory. [...] Boundary-layer theory is amenable to the method of matched asymptotic expansions for deriving approximate solutions. [...] In the simplest case of a flat plate parallel to the incoming flow, boundary-layer theory results in (<b>friction)</b> <b>drag,</b> whereas all inviscid flow theories will predict zero drag. [...] Importantly for aeronautics, Prandtl's theory can be applied directly to streamlined bodies like airfoils where, in addition to surface-friction drag, there is also form drag. Form drag is due to the effect of the boundary layer and thin wake on the pressure distribution around the airfoil.|$|E
50|$|The <b>friction</b> <b>drag</b> force, {{which is}} a {{tangential}} force on the aircraft surface, depends substantially on boundary layer configuration and viscosity.

Our model Milky Way galaxy is a relatively young system whose physical properties are in quite good agreement with observational determinations. In our model, the stellar halo is mainly formed from a few massive satellites accreted early on during the galaxy's lifetime. The stars in the halo do not exhibit any metallicity gradient, but higher metallicity stars are more centrally concentrated than stars with lower abundances.

40|$|SUMMARY. By {{means of}} the {{principles}} and assumptions {{used to calculate the}} profile drag of aerofoils a method is developed for calculating the total and skin <b>friction</b> <b>drags</b> of bodies of revolution at zero incidence. The method is applied to three bodies of different fineness ratio for three Reynolds numbers and three transition points. From the results curves are drawn showing the variation of total drag for a ra. nge of fineness ratio (00 to 3 : 1), Reynolds number (106 to 108) and transition point position (0 to o · Sl). Comparison with experimental results sho,vs satisfactory agreement. Interesting deductions are: form drag (a) ttl d = = O · 4 djl, approx. o a rag (b) Given the volume and transition point position the fineness ratio for which the drag is least is about 5 : 1. (c) Given the frontal area and transition point position the fineness ratio for which the drag is least is about 3 : 1. x...|$|R

40|$|Microswimmers {{capable of}} {{propulsion}} at low Reynolds numbers have {{great potential for}} numerous applications. Several kinds of artificial microswimmers, actuated by magnetic fields, with rigid helical tails have been developed. In previous works, we demonstrated that a magnetic swimmer with a soft tail could form a helical shape during rotation to propel itself at low Reynolds numbers. The advantage of compliant structures is that the high softness makes swimmers more adaptive in confined or complex environments. The interfacial <b>friction</b> <b>drags</b> are reduced by using superhydrophobic surfaces. Therefore, this paper aims to study the influence of surface and interface properties, particularly the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the soft tail surface, on the swimming performance. For this, we compared the swimming performance of two millimeter-scaled swimmers with a superhydrophilic soft tail and a superhydrophobic soft tail, respectively, in viscous liquids. The two swimmers exhibit different dynamic morphologies and swimming performance with the same input parameters. The swimmer with a superhydrophobic soft tail shows higher swimming velocity than that with a superhydrophilic soft tail, except in pure glycerol. The present work provides useful informations for selecting surface coating of swimmers with soft tails at low Reynolds numbers...|$|R
