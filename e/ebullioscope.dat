50|$|An <b>ebullioscope</b> (from the Latin ēbullīre (to boil) + -scope) is an {{instrument}} for measuring the boiling point of a liquid. This {{can be used for}} determining the alcoholic strength of a mixture, or for determining the molecular weight of a non-volatile solute based on the boiling-point elevation. The procedure is known as ebullioscopy.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>ebullioscope</b> {{was invented}} in 1838 by Honoré Brossard-Vidal, and was used for {{measuring}} alcoholic content. The advantage of this method was that the boiling point is relatively insensitive to other components such as sugars. Older alcoholimeters were based on measuring the density, which is {{more sensitive to the}} presence of other solutes.|$|E
50|$|A later {{version was}} built by the French chemist François-Marie Raoult, but the {{difficulty}} of determining the exact temperature was overcome by {{the invention of the}} Beckmann thermometer by Ernst Otto Beckmann in 1887. This improvement made the <b>ebullioscope</b> a standard apparatus to determine the molecular weight of substances in solution by using the ebullioscopic constant of the solvent.|$|E
50|$|Boiling-point {{elevation}} {{describes the}} phenomenon that {{the boiling point}} of a liquid (a solvent) will be higher when another compound is added, meaning that a solution has a higher boiling point than a pure solvent. This happens whenever a non-volatile solute, such as a salt, is added to a pure solvent, such as water. The boiling point can be measured accurately using an <b>ebullioscope.</b>|$|E
40|$|A glass <b>ebullioscope</b> {{was built}} and at {{atmospheric}} pressure, liquid-vapor equilibria {{relative to the}} Br 2 -HBr-H 2 O system, in the concentration range of interest for evaluation of the Mark 13 cycle was studied. Measurements were performed for the brome-azeotrope (HBr-H 2 O) pseudo-binary system and for the ternary system at temperatures lower than 125 C and in the bromine concentration range up to 13 % wt...|$|E
