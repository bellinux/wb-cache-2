5|$|Pharnavaz had {{introduced}} a military-administrative organization {{based on a}} network of regional governors or eristavi. The insignia of the eristavi, received from the king, constituted a sceptre, a special signet ring, belt and armament. Iberia had in total seven eristavis, in Colchis, Kakheti, Khunani (modern-day northern Azerbaijan), Samshvilde (Kvemo Kartli), Tsunda (included <b>Javakheti,</b> Kola and Artaani), Odzrkhe and Klarjeti. The kingdom had one spaspet who was under the direct control of the royal power based in Inner Kartli. Eristavates mimicked aspects of Achaemenid satrapies and Seleucid strategoi. The major motive of later historian of the chronicles was to convince posterity that the basic political structure of Kartli {{was created by the}} very first Georgian monarch in the wake of Wars of Alexander the Great; was of Achaemenid administrative system and had remained stable throughout Hellenistic, Parthian and Sasanian times. In this way, the long-term viability and stability of the Georgian realm are established.|$|E
25|$|The Georgian-Armenian War was {{a border}} war fought in 1918 between the Democratic Republic of Georgia and the Democratic Republic of Armenia over {{the parts of}} then disputed provinces of Lori, <b>Javakheti,</b> which had been {{historically}} bicultural Armenian-Georgian territories, but were largely populated by Armenians in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|After the war, The Georgian-Armenian War 1918 soon {{followed}} over the <b>Javakheti</b> and Lori provinces, with Armenia gaining the latter. Armenia and Azerbaijan {{engaged in the}} Armenian-Azerbaijani war (1918–1920) over Karabakh and Nakhichevan, with Armenia losing both due to Soviet intervention {{in favor of the}} anti west Turkish National Movement. The Turkish–Armenian War of 1920 resulted in the occupation/depopulation of even more Armenian land.|$|E
25|$|When {{the king}} of a unified Iberia, Bakur III, died in 580, the Sassanid {{government}} of Persia under Hormizd IV (578-590) seized on the opportunity to abolish the Iberian monarchy. Iberia became a Persian province ruled by a marzpan (governor). The Iberian nobles acquiesced to this change without resistance, while the heirs of the royal house withdrew to their highland fortresses – the main Chosroid line in Kakheti, and the younger Guaramid branch in Klarjeti and <b>Javakheti.</b> However, the direct Persian control brought about heavy taxation and an energetic promotion of Zoroastrianism in a largely Christian country. Therefore, when the Eastern Roman emperor Maurice embarked upon a military campaign against Persia in 582, the Iberian nobles requested that he helped restore the monarchy. Maurice did respond, and, in 588, sent his protégé, Guaram I of the Guaramids, as a new ruler to Iberia. However, Guaram was not crowned as king, but recognized as a presiding prince and bestowed with the Eastern Roman title of curopalates. The Byzantine-Sassanid treaty of 591 confirmed this new rearrangement, but left Iberia divided into Roman- and Sassanid-dominated parts at the town of Tbilisi.|$|E
500|$|During Zviad Gamsakhurdia's {{presidency}} (1991), <b>Javakheti</b> remained {{de facto}} semi-independent {{and only in}} November 1991 was the Tbilisi-appointed governor able to take power. The issue of <b>Javakheti</b> was in the 1990s [...] "clearly been perceived as the most dangerous potential ethnic conflict in Georgia", however, no actual armed conflict ever occurred. Taking into account {{the importance of the}} bilateral relations, the governments of Armenia and Georgia have pursued a careful and calming policy to avoid tension. The Armenian government has not made territorial claims to Georgia, nor has called for an autonomy in <b>Javakheti.</b> Armenia–Georgia relations have traditionally been friendly, however, from time to time tensions arise between the two countries. In recent years, the status of Armenian churches in Georgia and the status of the Armenian language in Georgian public schools had been a matter of dispute. Svante Cornell argues that [...] "Armenia seems to have had a calming influence on Javakhk" [...] as it is highly dependent on Georgia for imports. This viewpoint is shared by Georgian analysts.|$|E
500|$|The {{region of}} <b>Javakheti</b> (as known to Georgians)/Javakhk (as known to Armenians) {{comprises}} {{the districts of}} Akhalkalaki and Ninotsminda, both part of Samtskhe-Javakheti province of Georgia. It is overwhelmingly Armenian-populated (around 95%). The area is geographically isolated {{from the rest of}} Georgia and remains economically and socially isolated from Georgia. According to Svante Cornell, Javakhk enjoys [...] "wide cultural autonomy" [...] and [...] "certain Georgian analysts observe that the region is in practice as much 'Armenia' as 'Georgia'. It is distinctively easier to get around using Armenian than Georgian in this region; indeed, foreign visitors claim that at first they had difficulties determining which country they are in." [...] Generally, <b>Javakheti</b> Armenians live in [...] "reasonable inter-ethnic harmony" [...] within Georgia, although there is a [...] "fairly strong fear for the future, a sense of insecurity." [...] <b>Javakheti,</b> along with Lori and Borchali, was disputed by Armenia and Georgia from 1918 to 1920. A brief armed conflict took place between the two nations in December 1918, mostly over Lori.|$|E
500|$|United Javakhk Democratic Alliance, a local civil {{organization}}, is {{the main}} organization advocating for an Armenian autonomy in the region. It was founded in 1988, during {{the disintegration of the}} Soviet Union. It campaigns for a referendum in <b>Javakheti</b> on autonomy. It is believed that the organization has close links with the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. Although the ARF claims Javakhk as part of United Armenia, the ARF World Congresses [...] "have agreed with the demands raised by the Armenians of Javakhk that a Javakhk {{with a high degree of}} self-government within a federal Georgia would be able to sustain itself and would become a strong link in Georgian-Armenian relations." [...] ARF Bureau Chairman Hrant Markarian declared in the 2004 party congress: [...] "We want a strong, stable and autonomous <b>Javakheti</b> that is part of Georgia and enjoys state care." [...] The leader of the United Javakhk Democratic Alliance, Vahagn Chakhalian, was arrested in 2008 and freed in 2013. A 2014 article suggested that the alliance has little influence today.|$|E
500|$|The ARF idea of [...] "United Armenia" [...] {{incorporates}} {{claims to}} Western Armenia (eastern Turkey), Nagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh), the landlocked exclave Nakhichevan of Azerbaijan and the <b>Javakheti</b> (Javakhk) region of Georgia. Nagorno-Karabakh and Javakhk are overwhelmingly inhabited by Armenians. [...] Western Armenia and Nakhichevan had significant Armenian {{populations in the}} early 20th century, but no longer do. The Armenian population of eastern Turkey was almost completely exterminated during the genocide of 1915, when the millennia-long Armenian presence in the area largely ended and Armenian cultural heritage was mainly destroyed by the Turkish government. In 1919 the ARF-dominated government of the First Republic of Armenia declared the formal unification of Armenian lands. The ARF bases its claims to Turkey on the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres, which was effectively negated by subsequent historical events. The territorial claims to Turkey are often seen as {{the ultimate goal of}} the recognition of the Armenian Genocide and the hypothetical reparations of the genocide.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{the area}} {{comprised}} the following provinces: West of the Arsiani Mountains (Turk. Yalnızçam Dağları) were Tao, Klarjeti, Nigali, and Shavsheti, {{to the east}} lay Samtskhe, Erusheti, <b>Javakheti,</b> Artaani, Kola and Basiani. The landscape is characterised by mountains and the river-systems of the Chorokhi (Turk. Çoruh) and the Mtkvari (Turk. Kura).|$|E
2500|$|The overall region can be {{characterized}} as being made up of various, interconnected mountain ranges (largely of volcanic origin) and plateaus that do not exceed [...] in elevation. Prominent features of the area include the <b>Javakheti</b> Volcanic Plateau, lakes, including Tabatskuri and Paravani, as well as mineral water and hot springs. Two major rivers in Georgia are the Rioni and the Mtkvari. The Southern Georgia Volcanic Highland is a young and unstable geologic region with high seismic activity and has experienced some of the most significant earthquakes that have been recorded in Georgia.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{decades of}} the 9th century saw the rise of a new Georgian state in Tao-Klarjeti. Ashot Courapalate of the royal family of Bagrationi liberated from the Arabs the territories of former {{southern}} Iberia. These included the Principalities of Tao and Klarjeti, and the Earldoms of Shavsheti, Khikhata, Samtskhe, Trialeti, <b>Javakheti</b> and Ashotsi, which were formally a part of the Byzantine Empire, under the name of [...] "Curopalatinate of Iberia". In practice, however, the region functioned as a fully independent country with its capital in Artanuji. David Bagrationi expanded his domain by annexing the city of Theodossiopolis (Karin, Karnukalaki) and the Armenian province of Basiani, and by imposing a protectorate over the Armenian provinces of Kharqi, Apakhuni, Mantsikert, and Khlat, formerly controlled by the Kaysite Arab Emirs.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{detailed}} information about the event is described by a contemporary Georgian hagiographer Stephen of Tbeti in his best-known work Passion of Gobron. [...] Before beginning their destructive campaign in Georgian kingdoms and principalities, the Sajids overran Caucasian Albania and Armenia, executing king Smbat I. After pillaging 87 settlements in eastern Georgia and capturing Ujarma and Bochorma fortresses in Kakheti, the Sajid ruler of Azerbaijan, known as Abu l'Kasim in Georgia and Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj elsewhere, launched his massive army to Uplistsikhe, {{only to find the}} fortifications demolished by their defenders in order to prevent him from gaining a foothold in the vicinity. From there, the amir surged into Samtskhe and <b>Javakheti.</b> Unable to seize control of the stronghold of Tmogvi, he besieged the castle of Q'ueli (Q'uelis-Tsikhe), which was a fief of a prominent Georgian feudal, Gurgen II of Tao.|$|E

In practice, however, the region functioned as a fully independent country with its capital in Artanuji. The hereditary title of Curopalates was kept by the Bagrationi family, whose representatives ruled Tao-Klarjeti for almost a century. Curopalate David Bagrationi expanded his domain by annexing the city of Theodossiopolis (Karin, Karnukalaki) and the Armenian province of Basiani, and by imposing a protectorate over the Armenian provinces of Kharqi, Apakhuni, Mantsikert, and Khlat, formerly controlled by the Kaysite Arab Emirs.|$|E
2500|$|Klarjeti {{was one of}} the south-westernmost {{provinces of}} the Kingdom of Kartli, known to the Greco-Roman authors as Iberia, which {{appeared}} on the Caucasian political map in the 3rd century BC and was ruled—according to the medieval Georgian chronicles—by the Pharnabazid dynasty. From the 2nd century BC to the 3rd century AD, Klarjeti as well as some other neighboring lands were contested between the kingdoms of Iberia and Armenia (Armenians knew Klarjeti as Kļarjk'), and passed to and fro from one state to the other. In the 370s division of Iberia between the Roman and Iranian empires, Klarjeti passed to the former, but it is unknown whether as a province or as a vassal. The marriage of the Chosroid king Vakhtang I of Iberia to the Roman princess Helena seems to have enabled the Iberians to regain the province c. 485. Thereafter, Klarjeti remained in the possession of Vakhtang’s younger sons and their [...] descendants who formed the house of Guaramids and maintained themselves in Klarjeti and <b>Javakheti</b> until c. 786, when the Guaramid possessions passed to their resurgent cousins from the Bagrationi family (Georgian Bagratids).|$|E
