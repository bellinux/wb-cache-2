40|$|The ham mite, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, is {{the major}} target pest of <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> ham. Ham mites infest {{a wide range of}} stored food {{products}} such as dried meats, dried eggs, nuts, cheese, pet foods and grains (Townsend, 2007). Mites are very small (1 / 2 mm long), feed on the surface of <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> meat and follow the seam fat to the interior of the bone and interior of the hams. Mites cannot fly, but they can crawl around extensively and may be carried from one spot to another by humans and other insects. Heavily infested materials may have a sweet or minty odor and infested areas will have a powdery appearance from the buildup of dead mites and their coverings (Townsend, 2007). Methyl bromide has been used to fumigate <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> ham plants and is the only known fumigant that is effective at eradiating ham mite infestations at this time (EPA, 2010). However, methyl bromide is classified as a Class 1 ozone depletion substance and will be phased out for all industries by 2015 (EPA, 2006).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the ecology of moulds and their toxic {{potential}} during the pre-ripening or ripening of San Daniele <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> ham. Three different facilities and their products were investigated. These facilities were chosen {{on the basis of}} their production capacity: one for industrial production, one for semi-industrial production and one for handicraft production. The mould microflora was predominantly represented by 2 genera, which were found either on the surface of <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> ham or in the air of the production rooms. The identified species were quite similar among the three facilities. Penicillium spp. and Aspergillus spp. were the main genera isolated during the duration of pre-ripening and ripening. The toxic potential of the isolated strains and the presence of Ochratoxin A (OTA) on the surface of or in San Daniele <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> ham were also investigated. No OTA was found either on the surface (mould slime) or in the meat of the investigated hams. Moreover, no OTA-producing moulds, with the exception of Aspergillus niger, were isolated. However, different yeast and mould strains were tested for the ability to inhibit the growth of OTA producing moulds. Penicillium nalgiovense, Candida guilliermondii and Endomycopsis fibuliger prevented the growth of co-inoculated OTA producing moulds, and no OTA was detected on the surface of the <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> ham.

40|$|Ochratoxin A and L. monocytogenes in San Daniele <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> ham: occurrence, {{reduction}} and prevention. The fungal {{population of the}} plants and of <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> ham of San Daniele is varied and complex. However, {{it does not seem}} to be formed from species producing ochratoxin A (OTA), in contrast to that observed by other authors. Nevertheless we wanted to evaluate "in vitro" for the production of OTA in all species of Aspergillus and Penicillium, isolated from ripening rooms and <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> ham. None has shown the ability to synthesize OTA. Consequently, based on what is observed it can exclude the presence of this mycotoxin on surfaces or in the meat of San Daniele ham. Furthermore, the use of a starter consisting in Penicillium nalgiovense, Candida guilliermondii or Saccharomycopsis fibuliger, prevents the development of micotossigenic mold in ham during the pre-curing and aging. The antilisterial activity of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) bacteriophage Listex P 100 (phage P 100) is demonstrated in broths and on the surface of slice of <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> ham and pork skin against 19 strains or serotypes (i. e. 2 a, 1 / 2 a, 4 b) of Listeria monocytogenes. In a broth model system, phage P 100 completely inhibited either 2 log CFU/cm 2 or 3 log CFU/cm 2 of L. monocytogenes growth at 30 °C at phage concentrations equal or upper than 7 log PFU/ml. The temperature (4, 10, 20 °C) seemed not to influence the phages activity, nevertheless at 4 °C it was possible obtained the best results. On <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> ham slices, a phage concentration from 5 to 8 log PFU/cm 2 was required to obtain significant L. monocytogenres reduction. In particular at 4 °C an inocolum of 8 PFU was required to eliminate completely a concentration of 2 log L. monocytogenes/cm 2 and to reach 0 tolerance according USA food law. At 10 and 20 °C the reductions were less significatives and yielded 3. 0 and 2. 4 log CFU/cm 2. Phage P 100 remained stable on <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> ham slices over a 14 day storage period, with only a marginal loss of 0. 2 log PFU/cm 2 from an initial phage treatment of 8 log PFU/cm 2. Moreover phage P 100 allowed to eliminate free L. monocytogenes cells and its biofilms on the surfaces of the rooms of <b>dry</b> <b>cured</b> ham plant production.
