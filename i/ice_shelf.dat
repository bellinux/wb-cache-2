5|$|Antarctica is {{intensely}} {{cold and}} arid. Most of the world's freshwater ice is contained within its sheets.

5|$|Rohling's 2004 Bipolar model {{suggests}} that sea level rise lifted buoyant ice shelves, causing their destabilisation and destruction.

5|$|The Antarctic sheet {{is divided}} by the Transantarctic Mountains into two unequal {{sections}} known as the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) and the smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The EAIS rests on a major land mass but {{the bed of the}} WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below sea level. It would be seabed if the ice sheet were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf,</b> the Ronne <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf,</b> and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Since the 1970 s, the sudden, rapid {{collapse}} of 20 % of <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> on the Antarctic Peninsula {{has led to}} large-scale thinning and acceleration of its tributary glaciers. The leading hypothesis for the {{collapse of}} most of these <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> {{is the process of}} hydrofracturing, whereby a water-filled crevasse is opened by the hydrostatic pressure acting at the crevasse tip. This process has been linked to observed atmospheric warming through the increased supply of meltwater. Importantly, the low-density firn layer near the ice-shelf surface, providing a porous medium in which meltwater can percolate and refreeze, has to be filled in with refrozen meltwater first, before hydrofracturing can occur at all. Here we build upon this notion of firn air depletion as a precursor of ice-shelf collapse, by using a firn model to show that pore space was depleted in the firn layer on former <b>ice</b> <b>shelves,</b> which enabled their collapse due to hydrofracturing. Two climate scenario runs with the same model indicate that during the 21 st century most Antarctic Peninsula <b>ice</b> <b>shelves,</b> and some minor <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> elsewhere, are more likely to become susceptible to collapse following firn air depletion. If warming continues into the 22 nd century, similar depletion will become widespread on <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> around East Antarctica. Our model further suggests that a projected increase in snowfall will protect the Ross and Filchner–Ronne <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelves</b> from hydrofracturing in the coming two centuries...|$|R

5|$|It {{would be}} more than 40years before the first {{crossing}} of Antarctica was achieved, by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1955–58. This expedition set out from Vahsel Bay, following a route which avoided the Beardmore Glacier altogether, and bypassed much of the Ross <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf,</b> reaching McMurdo Sound via a descent of the Skelton Glacier. The entire journey took 98days.|$|E
5|$|The first ship {{to reach}} Pine Island Glacier's <b>ice</b> <b>shelf,</b> in Pine Island Bay, was the USS/USCGC Glacier in 1985.

40|$|Interpreting the {{dynamics}} {{and history of}} <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> is important for evaluating the response of ice sheets to climatic and oceanographic changes. <b>Ice</b> <b>shelves</b> have received considerable attention in the Antarctic Peninsula, as they have undergone sequential, rapid col-lapse (Vaughan & Doake 1996; Morris & Vaughan 2003; Cooke et al. 2005; Cook & Vaughan 2010), following a long period during which their grounding-lines had been stable (Rebesco et al. 2014). A detailed understanding of ice-shelf character and behaviour is therefore of immediate interest, yet the geological record of <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> is largely unknown. Geological and structural glaciological data can provide vital information concerning the evolution of <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> over time.

40|$|We {{compare the}} volume flux {{divergence}} of Antarctic <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> in 2007 and 2008 with 1979 to 2010 surface accumulation and 2003 to 2008 thinning {{to determine their}} rates of melting and mass balance. Basal melt of 1325 ± 235 gigatons per year (Gt/year) exceeds a calving flux of 1089 ± 139 Gt/year, making ice-shelf melting the largest ablation process in Antarctica. The giant cold-cavity Ross, Filchner, and Ronne <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> covering two-thirds of the total ice-shelf area account for only 15 % of net melting. Half of the meltwater comes from 10 small, warm-cavity Southeast Pacific <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> occupying 8 % of the area. A similar high melt/area ratio is found for six East Antarctic <b>ice</b> <b>shelves,</b> implying undocumented strong ocean thermal forcing on their deep grounding lines...|$|R
5|$|According {{to various}} organisations (the National Science Foundation, NASA, the University of California, San Diego, Russian State Museum of the Arctic and Antarctic, among others), ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica or its <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> in 1820: von Bellingshausen (a {{captain in the}} Imperial Russian Navy), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the Royal Navy), and Nathaniel Palmer (a sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut).|$|E

40|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>shelves</b> {{respond quickly}} and profoundly to a warming climate.

5|$|The Ross {{expedition}} was {{a voyage}} of scientific {{exploration of the}} Antarctic in 1839 to 1843, led by James Clark Ross, with two unusually strong warships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror. It explored {{what is now called}} the Ross Sea and discovered the Ross <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf.</b> On the expedition, Ross discovered the Transantarctic Mountains and the volcanoes Erebus and Terror, named after his ships.

5|$|Although {{myths and}} {{speculation}} about a Terra Australis ("Southern Land") {{date back to}} antiquity, Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered and colonised by humans, unsighted until 1820 when the Russian expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on Vostok and Mirny sighted the Fimbul <b>ice</b> <b>shelf.</b> The continent, however, remained largely neglected {{for the rest of}} the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of easily accessible resources, and isolation. In 1895, the first confirmed landing was conducted by a team of Norwegians.|$|E
5|$|Melting of {{floating}} ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) {{does not in}} itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.|$|E

He returned to the Barrier several times, hoping to penetrate it, {{but was unable to}} do so, achieving his Farthest South in a small Barrier inlet at 78°10′, in February 1842. Ross suspected that land lay to the east of the Barrier, but was unable to confirm this.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1970s an {{important}} focus of {{study has been}} the ozone layer in the atmosphere above Antarctica. In 1985, three British scientists working on data they had gathered at Halley Station on the Brunt <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf</b> discovered {{the existence of a}} hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction of the ozone was caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) emitted by human products. With the ban of CFCs in the Montreal Protocol of 1989, climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} discoveries of major {{scientific}} importance. These included the snow-free Dry Valleys {{in the western}} mountains, the emperor penguin colony at Cape Crozier, scientific evidence that the Ice Barrier was a floating <b>ice</b> <b>shelf,</b> and a leaf fossil discovered by Ferrar which helped to establish Antarctica's relation to the Gondwana super-continent. Thousands of geological and biological specimens had been collected and new marine species identified. The location of the South Magnetic Pole had been calculated with reasonable accuracy. On the medical side, Wilson discovered the anti-scorbutic effects of fresh seal meat, which resolved the lethal threat of scurvy to this and subsequent expeditions.|$|E

30|$|Another {{problem is}} the {{misinterpretation}} of the signal from <b>ice</b> <b>shelves,</b> landfast <b>ice,</b> and icebergs as that from areas of thin ice. These types of ice generally exist adjacent to coastal polynyas, and their microwave characteristics can be {{similar to those of}} thin ice. To overcome this problem in the Antarctic, <b>ice</b> <b>shelves,</b> landfast <b>ice,</b> and icebergs are discriminated from thin sea ice by using a scatter plot of vertical versus horizontal polarization brightness temperatures (TBs) (Tamura et al. 2007, 2015; Nihashi and Ohshima 2015).

The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties led by Edgeworth David {{became the}} first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole. Douglas Mawson, who assumed the {{leadership}} of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931. In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908– February 1909: they were the first humans to traverse the Ross <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf,</b> the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountains (via the Beardmore Glacier), and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram {{became the first}} to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route from the Bay of Whales and up the Axel Heiberg Glacier. One month later, the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole.|$|E
5|$|The Barrier (later {{known as}} the Ross <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf)</b> was sighted on 23 January, but the inlet had disappeared; the Barrier edge had changed {{significantly}} in the intervening years, and the section which had included the inlet had broken away to form a considerable bay, which Shackleton named the Bay of Whales after {{the large number of}} whales seen there. Shackleton was not prepared to risk wintering on a Barrier surface that might calve into the sea, so he turned the ship towards King Edward VII Land. After repeated efforts to approach this coast had failed, and with rapidly moving ice threatening to trap the ship, Nimrod was forced to retreat. Shackleton's only choice now, other than abandonment of the expedition's goals, was to break the promise he had given to Scott. On 25 January he ordered the ship to head for McMurdo Sound.|$|E
