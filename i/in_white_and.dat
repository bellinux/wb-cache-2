40|$|Impaired stress-induced {{pressure}} natriuresis, ie, {{an inadequate}} compensatory increase in urinary sodium excretion (U(Na) V) {{in response to}} a stress-induced blood pressure increase, may lead to the premature development of essential hypertension. To assess the heritability of baseline U(Na) V, stress U(Na) V, and the U(Na) V response to stress (Delta U(Na) V=stress U(Na) V - baseline U(Na) V), we studied 396 black <b>and</b> 494 <b>white</b> twins, including monozygotic and dizygotic twins of the same as well as the opposite sex (mean age: 17. 6 +/- 3. 3 years; range: 11. 9 to 30. 0 years). Bivariate genetic model fitting was performed to examine the extent to which genetic and environmental factors are common or specific to baseline and stress U(Na) V. Heritability estimates for Delta U(Na) V can be derived from these bivariate models. All of the bivariate analyses were performed separately <b>in</b> <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> blacks, because univariate models for baseline U(Na) V showed significant ethnic differences in heritability estimates. Best-fitting models showed that the heritability of stress U(Na) V was 0. 42 <b>in</b> <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> 0. 58 <b>in</b> blacks. Only 15 % and 11 % of the total variance could be attributed to genetic factors common to baseline and stress U(Na) V <b>in</b> <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> blacks, respectively. After removal of all of the shared influences with baseline U(Na) V, heritabilities for stress U(Na) V were 0. 32 <b>in</b> <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> 0. 57 <b>in</b> blacks. Heritability estimates for Delta U(Na) V were 0. 36 <b>in</b> <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> 0. 39 <b>in</b> blacks. In summary, this study establishes Delta U(Na) V and stress U(Na) V as heritable phenotypes that may be used to study the genetic etiology of early hypertension development.

5|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} the meeting at Peterloo {{was the number of}} women present. Female reform societies had been formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain. Many of the women were dressed distinctively <b>in</b> <b>white,</b> <b>and</b> some formed all-female contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later {{as a result of their}} wounds. It has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of the crowd was made up of women, suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that the women were especially targeted, a view apparently supported by the large number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons.|$|E

The album's cover art is a blue-tinted nighttime photograph of the band, all dressed <b>in</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> {{standing in front of}} a lake. The band name is rendered in tiny white lights above their heads, and other small white lights are scattered at their feet. In keeping with the tiny lights theme, the back of the booklet shows a satellite image of the United States at night, in which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations. The album's disc artwork is designed after a centaur with a crow's head in place of the man's head.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, with Ken Bates now {{owner of}} the club, Chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked. The new badge {{featured}} a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, <b>in</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. This lasted for the next 19 years, with some modifications {{such as the use}} of different colours, including red from 1987 to 1995, and yellow from 1995 until 1999, before the white returned. With the new ownership of Roman Abramovich, and the club's centenary approaching, combined with demands from fans for the popular 1950s badge to be restored, it was decided that the crest should be changed again in 2005. The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the 2005–06 season and marked a return to the older design, used from 1953 to 1986, featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff. For the centenary season this was accompanied by the words '100 YEARS' and 'CENTENARY 2005–2006' on the top and bottom of the crest respectively.|$|E
5|$|Mariano {{was told}} that this refined cloth was {{restricted}} for use only by the bishop of the city. Mariano {{went to see the}} prelate, who was surprised by the request. He ordered an inquiry of Manuel, directed by the priest of Oncogate (Quispicanchi), a village close to the mountain. On June 12, 1783, the commission ascended Qullqipunku with Mariano; they found Manuel dressed <b>in</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> shining with a bright light. Blinded, they retreated, returning with a larger party. On their second try they reached the boy. But when they touched him, he was transformed into a tayanka bush (Baccharis odorata) with the crucified Christ hanging from it. Thinking the party had harmed his friend, Mariano fell dead on the spot. He was buried under the rock where Manuel had last appeared.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the difference in heart rate recovery (HRR) and heart rate variability (HRV) after a maximal treadmill test between <b>white</b> <b>and</b> black men. Sixty white (n = 30) and black (n = 30) college-age men volunteered as study subjects. All subjects performed a maximal graded exercise test on a treadmill. HRR was determined from the difference between HR recorded at maximal exercise and the HR recorded at 1 -minute (HRR 1) and 2 -minutes (HRR 2) post-exercise. HRV was analyzed in the supine position 5 min-utes before and between 25 to 30 minutes after the exercise protocol. The HRV was examined as the standard deviation of all successful R-R intervals (SDNN), normal-ized high frequency power (HFnu), and normalized low frequency to high fre-quency ratio (LFnu:HFnu). No difference was found in pre-exercise HRV or HRR 1. However, racial differences were revealed in the following parameters: HRR 2 = 39. 93 ± 8. 87 beats. min- 1 <b>in</b> <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> 46. 16 ± 8. 95 beats. min- 1 in blacks (p <. 01), post-exer-cise SDNN = 35. 55 ± 16. 58 ms <b>in</b> <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> 48. 37 ± 22. 51 ms in blacks (p <. 05), post-exercise HFnu = 16. 60 ± 12. 24 ms 2 <b>in</b> <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> 27. 62 ± 15. 52 ms 2 in blacks (p <. 01), and post-exercise LFnu:HFnu = 9. 48 ± 6. 51 <b>in</b> <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> 4. 85 ± 5. 01 in blacks (p <. 01).

5|$|On February 17, 1988, {{the present}} Ven Sayadaw Buddhanta Panya Vamsa of Htilin Monastery and Pitaka Kyaung {{initiated}} {{the ritual of}} daily face washing of the deity at dawn. This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4:30 am when monks wash the face and brush {{the teeth of the}} Buddha image. It is an elaborate ritual performed for over an hour by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire, assisted by several lay helpers, dressed <b>in</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> wearing formal headdress. As soon as the drums are struck, the senior monk residing in the adjoining monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh towels, offered by devotees. He then performs the act of cleaning the Mahamuni's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence of cleaning with fresh towels. After this, sandalwood paste is applied to the image and it is again cleaned with towels and finally sprinkled with scented water. After the ceremony is completed, the used towels are returned to the devotees who keep these towels with reverence in their home shrines.|$|E

Following Deacon's memories, Sviatoslav was a blue-eyed male of average height but of stalwart build, much more sturdy than Tzimiskes. He shaved his blond head and his beard but wore a bushy mustache and a sidelock {{as a sign of}} his nobility. He preferred to dress <b>in</b> <b>white,</b> <b>and</b> it was noted that his garments were much cleaner than those of his men, although he had a lot in common with his warriors. He wore a single large gold earring bearing a carbuncle and two pearls.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church was richly decorated. The walls were plastered and painted <b>in</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> maroon with geometric patterns and lines designed {{to give the impression}} of ashlar masonry. Architectural detail was also picked out in maroon. The floors were covered in polychrome encaustic tiles featuring foliage, heraldic beasts, and coats of arms including those of England, France, the Holy Roman Empire, Queen Eleanor of Castile, Richard of Cornwall and many powerful noble families. The chapels in the south transept had tiles with symbols of Edward the Confessor and the Virgin Mary. The windows of the church were filled with painted glass, six panels of which have been recovered. They show scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, the Crucifixion, monks, monsters and humorous animals.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Traktor, and was developed as an independent video from the film but contained Bond influences. It depicts Madonna as a prisoner in a torture chamber, alternating with scenes of a fencing duel between good (clad <b>in</b> <b>white)</b> <b>and</b> evil (clad in black) personas of the singer. Wounds inflicted on both fencers are mirrored on the imprisoned Madonna, {{and in the end}} she escapes being electrocuted in the chamber. The usage of Jewish religious texts and objects in the music video led to controversy, with scholars of Judaism deeming it sacrilegious. Madonna has included the song on two of her world tours; the first being the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour and again as a video interlude on the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour.|$|E

The horizontal angular geometrical shape is sketched <b>in</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> grey in the mid-ground, and represents an early form of a spatial device Bacon was to develop and perfect during the 1950s, when it effectively became a cage used to frame the anguished figures portrayed in Bacon's foregrounds. In the mid-ground, the artist has sketched a street scene, which features walking stick figures and cars. The pedestrians appear oblivious to the slaughter before them.|$|E

5|$|Believed to {{have been}} {{introduced}} by Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud, although some sources, such as Abdel-Wahab, claim {{that it was in}} use three centuries earlier, the flag was rectangular in shape and divided into nine stripes, the middle one green and double the size of all other bands, while the others alternated between yellow and red. Featured {{in the center of the}} green stripe was the Zulfiqar, the legendary Islamic sword of Ali, with the blade <b>in</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> the hilt multicolored. The red and yellow stripes each contained five equidistant symbols, whose order was alternated between each stripe. These symbols were divided into two categories: one red six-sided star voided with a disk of a different color in the center—either a red star and green disk or a white star and blue disk—, and a large disk voided in its lower right by a small disk of different color, with the combination being either a small red disk within a larger blue disk or a small yellow disk within a larger red disk. The first yellow stripe contains three red stars and two blue disks. The second stripe, red in color, contains three green disksand two white stars. The third stripe (second yellow one) is identical to the first, with the exception that the star in its center is white, while the fourth stripe (second white one) is identical to the second stripe.|$|E
5|$|Newton's {{monument}} (1731) {{can be seen}} in Westminster Abbey, at {{the north}} of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb. It was executed by the sculptor Michael Rysbrack (1694–1770) <b>in</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> grey marble with design by the architect William Kent. The monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. A relief panel depicts putti using instruments such as a telescope and prism. The Latin inscription on the base translates as:Here is buried Isaac Newton, Knight, who by a strength of mind almost divine, and mathematical principles peculiarly his own, explored the course and figures of the planets, the paths of comets, the tides of the sea, the dissimilarities in rays of light, and, what no other scholar has previously imagined, the properties of the colours thus produced. Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners.
