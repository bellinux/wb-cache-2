Sixty-three countries submitted films to the Academy, {{the highest number}} of submissions {{in the history of the}} award, including Azerbaijan and Ireland, which submitted films for the first time. Several of the submissions were subject to controversy. The Academy determined that <b>initial</b> <b>submissions</b> from Israel and Taiwan did not meet Academy requirements, and both countries submitted new films as replacements. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts was subject to criticism for not submitting the Scottish Gaelic [...] or the Welsh Calon Gaeth. Bolivia's official submission, Los Andes no creen en Dios, did not appear on the Academy's list of accepted submissions.|$|E

50|$|Wesker's play The Merchant (which {{he later}} renamed Shylock) {{uses the same}} three stories used by Shakespeare for his play The Merchant of Venice. In this retelling, Shylock and Antonio are fast friends bound by a common love of books, culture and a disdain for the crass {{antisemitism}} of the Christian community's laws. They make the bond in defiant mockery of the Christian establishment, never anticipating that the bond might become forfeit. When it does, the play argues, Shylock must carry through on {{the letter of the}} law or jeopardize the scant legal security of the entire Jewish community. He is, therefore, quite as grateful as Antonio when Portia, as in Shakespeare's play, shows the legal way out. The play received its American premiere on 16 November 1977 at New York's Plymouth Theatre with Joseph Leon as Shylock, Marian Seldes as Shylock's sister Rivka and Roberta Maxwell as Portia. This production had a challenging history in previews on the road, culminating (after the first night out of town in Philadelphia on 8 September 1977) with the death of the exuberant Broadway star Zero Mostel, who was initially cast as Shylock. Wesker wrote a book, The Birth of Shylock and the Death of Zero Mostel, chronicling the entire process from <b>initial</b> <b>submissions</b> and rejections of the play through to rehearsals, Zero's death, and the disappointment of the critical reception for the Broadway opening. The book reveals much about the playwright's relationship to director John Dexter (who had been the earliest, near-familial interpreter of Wesker's works), to criticism, to casting, and to the ephemeral process of collaboration through which the text of any play must pass.|$|E
