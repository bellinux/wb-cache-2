25|$|The adidas Golden Ball {{could only}} <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the members of}} the victorious Ghanaian side, and so it was, with Lamptey taking home a very special {{souvenir}} from his Italian sojourn. Lamptey was the beating heart of a very good side. His fast feet, speed of thought, and clever interplay with captain Alex Opoku and fellow midfielders Mohammed Gargo and Emmanuel Duah were on display for all to see. His willingness to get into the box was critical too, and his four goals made him joint top-goalscorer.|$|E

Jones was awarded the Val Barker trophy, as the best stylistic boxer of the 1988 games, which was only the third and to this day the last time in the competition's history when the award did not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the gold medal winners. The incident led Olympic organizers to establish a new scoring system for Olympic boxing.|$|E

Performing with Slipknot, he would also {{come to be known}} as [...] "Number Eight", being that the band follows a numbering scheme for its members, ranging from 0–8. According to Shawn Crahan, Corey wanted number eight, because it symbolizes infinity.|$|E

2500|$|While the Hull patent gave GE a {{basis for}} {{claiming}} legal rights over the fluorescent lamp, {{a few months after}} the lamp went into production the firm learned of a U.S. patent application that had been filed in 1927 for the aforementioned [...] "metal vapor lamp" [...] invented in Germany by Meyer, Spanner, and Germer. The patent application indicated that the lamp had been created as a superior means of producing ultraviolet light, but the application also contained a few statements referring to fluorescent illumination. Efforts to obtain a U.S. patent had met with numerous delays, but were it to be granted, the patent might have caused serious difficulties for GE. At first, GE sought to block the issuance of a patent by claiming that priority should <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their employees, Leroy J. Buttolph, who according to their claim had invented a fluorescent lamp in 1919 and whose patent application was still pending. GE also had filed a patent application in 1936 in Inman’s name to cover the “improvements” wrought by his group. In 1939 GE decided that the claim of Meyer, Spanner, and Germer had some merit, and that in any event a long interference procedure was not in their best interest. They therefore dropped the Buttolph claim and paid $180,000 to acquire the Meyer, et al. application, which at that point was owned by a firm known as Electrons, Inc. The patent was duly awarded in December 1939. [...] This patent, along with the Hull patent, put GE on what seemed to be firm legal ground, although it faced years of legal challenges from Sylvania Electric Products, Inc., which claimed infringement on patents that it held.|$|E
