But I feel like we've done the athletes justice by telling those stories or through live coverage, or with reporters on site. We've tried to make sure we're at all the significant events, and with Canada winning over 180 medals, that's a tall task." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asked by the Dallas Observer for {{his view}} of {{religion}} and spirituality, Lennon said,I'm not against religion, because I think it serves a purpose in our society {{and it can be}} helpful to certain groups of people. But, for me, religion is mythology. ... I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all have a spirit, and I think there's a lot more to life and human consciousness than science can explain. But I prefer looking to science for answers because it can be tested and vigorously logical.|$|E

Trainer Todd Pletcher entered two horses, with Neolithic assigned to set a fast early pace in the hopes of tiring Gun Runner, while Rally Cry was intended to close from behind. The race went much as expected, with Gun Runner stalking Neolithic for the first 6 furlongs before swinging to the lead on the far turn. Gun Runner maintained his momentum and eventually won by [...] lengths over the late-closing Rally Cry. His time of 1:47.43 was the fastest Woodward Stakes since the race was moved to Saratoga in 2006 and earned Gun Runner a career high Beyer Speed Figure of 115. He was also given a Timeform US rating of 142, the highest Timeform US rating ever achieved. [...] "That was better than the Whitney, just stronger, faster overall," [...] said Geroux.
