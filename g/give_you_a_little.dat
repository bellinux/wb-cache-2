500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} day of the trial, Winthrop recorded, [...] "Mrs. Hutchinson, the court you see hath labored to bring you to {{acknowledge}} the error of your way that so you might be reduced. The time now grows late. We shall therefore <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time to consider of it and therefore desire that you attend the court again in the morning." [...] The first day had gone fairly well for Hutchinson, who had held her own in a battle of wits with the magistrates. Biographer Eve LaPlante suggests, [...] "Her success before the court may have astonished her judges, but it was no surprise to her. [...] She was confident of herself and her intellectual tools, largely because of the intimacy she felt with God." ...|$|E
500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am going to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted {{that he would like to}} take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E
2500|$|Dev's electro {{style and}} [...] "sing-talk" [...] vocal style have been {{compared}} to fellow pop singer Kesha. Dev responded to this, saying, [...] "I'm confident enough in what I do that people will see me for who I am ... I get why people compare us but once people see me live they won't connect us as much." [...] While comparing her to Kesha, Idolator wrote that [...] "Dev's beats come off a bit more mellow and her songs {{a little bit more}} electro than pop." [...] In response to being compared to both Kesha and Uffie, Dev said, [...] "I just feel that I have a lot more to say and the ability to have an eclectic sound, I'm not bashing either artist, but I'm {{going to be able to}} <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more than what you've heard on those records. When my album comes out, hopefully I won't have to hear another reference or comparison." [...] Much of Dev's music is inspired by rap music, as she believes that fans respond to [...] "pop music but with rap roots". She said, [...] "I've always been into hip-hop. Eminem changed my life when I was younger." [...] The Hollywood Reporter compared her [...] "futuristic" [...] and [...] "pulsing" [...] sound to underground electroclash musicians Peaches and Yelle. Dev's musical genres have been cited as electro-crunk and electropop.|$|E
