5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail <b>hair</b> <b>growing</b> {{from the top of the}} tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding in certain parts of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E
5|$|Although zduhaći (plural) {{could be}} women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power {{was thought to}} be inborn. In many regions it was {{regarded}} that the zduhaći were born with a caul—white or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuči, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhać. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhać in Herzegovina could be a tuft of <b>hair</b> <b>growing</b> on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role in the birth of zduhaći, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who were conceived on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|Professor Calculus, Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, and Calculus' {{assistant}} Frank Wolff are aboard {{an atomic}} rocket-powered spacecraft leaving the Earth {{bound for the}} Moon. Soon after takeoff they discover that the detectives Thomson and Thompson have accidentally stowed away onboard, putting a strain on the oxygen supply. The detectives accidentally turn off the nuclear motor, disrupting the artificial gravity and sending everyone floating until Tintin corrects the problem. They then suffered a relapse of the Formula 14 drug (seen in Land of Black Gold (1950)), resulting in their <b>hair</b> <b>growing</b> rapidly in multiple colours. Calculus subsequently administers a cure. Haddock, who has smuggled whisky aboard the rocket, gets drunk and takes an impromptu spacewalk, during which he briefly becoming a satellite of the asteroid Adonis (at which point, Professor Calculus humorously says he will tell Earth that Adonis has a new satellite {{by the name of}} Haddock) but Tintin is able to rescue him.|$|E

The video backdrop showed images of a bald Spears, with her <b>hair</b> <b>growing</b> as the song went along. However, the backdrop was later removed for unknown reasons. After the announcement of the 2002 extension of the tour, some changes were made to the setlist, replacing the original mix of the song by [...] "The Darkchild Remix". The remix was later performed on The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004), during the opening act, right after the performance of [...] "Toxic" [...] (2003).

500|$|Thinner {{than most}} of the other men who have portrayed Edna, Travolta {{appeared}} onscreen in a large fat suit, and required four hours of makeup in order to appear before the cameras. His character's nimble dancing style belies her girth; Shankman based Edna's dancing style on the hippo ballerinas in the Dance of the Hours sequence in Walt Disney's 1940 animated feature, Fantasia. Although early versions of the suit created [...] "a dumpy, Alfred Hitchcock version of Edna," [...] Travolta fought for the ability to give his character curves and a thick Baltimore accent. Designed by Tony Gardner, the fat suit was created using lightweight synthetic materials, consisting of layered pads and silicone, which was used from the chest upwards. The suit provided the additional benefit of covering Travolta's beard, eliminating the problem of his facial <b>hair</b> <b>growing</b> through his makeup midday.|$|E
500|$|The {{head has}} a {{straight}} or slightly concave facial profile, a flat forehead, and wide, short ears. A distinguishing {{characteristic of the}} breed is a [...] "beard" [...] of <b>hair</b> <b>growing</b> below the cheeks. Small white markings are allowed on the face, but never on the legs. The neck is of medium length in the modern Mérens, and often shorter and broader in the traditional version. The shoulders are sloping and moderately long, and the chest wide and deep. Pronounced withers are favored in those Mérens used for pack horses, but as with most mountain horses, many traditional Mérens have wide, flat withers. The girth is deep. The back is generally shorter in modern Mérens than in the traditional version, where horses with long, strong backs were preferred for use as pack horses. The croup is well-muscled and the tail low-set. The legs are strong and solid, with well-defined joints. They tend to be quite short, and some have hocks set too close together, a recurrent fault in mountain horses. The feet are large and well-formed, allowing the horses to go without shoes. There is abundant feathering on the lower legs.|$|E
500|$|Kapoor's {{first job}} {{was as a}} {{waitress}} at age 15, although it lasted only a week. As a teenager, she struggled with her weight: [...] "I had every issue related to weight that I could have. I was unhealthy, I had bad skin, and I had <b>hair</b> <b>growing</b> on my face!" [...] Kapoor was diagnosed with insulin resistance and polycystic ovarian disease, and has since begun an initiative to increase awareness of diabetes. Kapoor enrolled at the United World College of South East Asia in Singapore for her pre-university education, where she studied theatre and arts. She has said she later started courses in economics and political science through University of Mumbai correspondence programme, [...] after returning from University of East London where she began her bachelor's degree in the same subjects but returned to Mumbai soon after she began. The actress Rani Mukerji, a family friend, visited her family in Singapore on holiday while working on Black (2005). Kapoor, who had originally {{wanted to be a}} director and writer, expressed a desire to work as a crew member on the film. On her father's recommendation to director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, she was appointed as his assistant.|$|E
2500|$|Sloth fur {{exhibits}} specialized functions: {{the outer}} <b>hairs</b> <b>grow</b> {{in a direction}} opposite from that of other mammals. In most mammals, <b>hairs</b> <b>grow</b> toward the extremities, but because sloths {{spend so much time}} with their limbs above their bodies, their <b>hairs</b> <b>grow</b> away from the extremities to provide protection from the elements while they hang upside down. In most conditions, the fur hosts symbiotic algae, which provide camouflage. Because of the algae, sloth fur is a small ecosystem of its own, hosting many species of commensal and parasitic arthropods. Some of the commensal arthropods are highly specific and are only found on a particular sloth species.|$|R

500|$|The show {{began with}} a woman dressed in an 18th-century white nightgown who talked to the {{audience}} briefly before disappearing. There was a video introduction in which different people told their dreams. At {{the end of the}} video, Spears appeared sleeping in a bubble. A platform with a wheel attached rose several feet above the ground, and she appeared strapped to it while wearing a black ensemble. She started rotating in a similar way to a target girl while starting to perform [...] "Oops!...I Did It Again" [...] with her dancers. [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] was performed next with Spears captured by her dancers. She left the stage for a costume change while her dancers performed. [...] "Overprotected" [...] was performed next with Spears (dressed in a futuristic version of one of Elvis Presley's jumpsuit) surrounded by laser lights. The video backdrop showed images of a bald Spears, with her <b>hair</b> <b>growing</b> as the song went along. In the next section, a giant musical box was raised, and Spears emerged from the middle as a ballerina to perform [...] "Born To Make You Happy".

500|$|Mary Shelley {{had called}} the baby Allegra [...] "the little Commodore" [...] because of her sturdy body and alert, {{intelligent}} look. Byron was also pleased with Allegra's resemblances to himself in appearance and temperament. When she was eighteen months old, {{he wrote in a}} letter to a friend: [...] "My bastard came three days ago—very like—healthy—noisy & capricious." [...] In an 1818 letter to his half-sister Augusta Leigh, Byron wrote that [...] "She is very pretty—remarkably intelligent ... She has very blue eyes—that singular forehead—fair curly hair—and a devil of a spirit—but that is Papa's." [...] In 1819, in another letter to Leigh, Byron described two and a half-year-old Allegra as [...] "very droll" [...] and again commented on her resemblance to himself in physical appearance, temperament and interests: [...] "(She) has a very good deal of the Byron. Can't articulate the letter 'r' at all—frowns and pouts quite in our way—blue eyes—light <b>hair</b> <b>growing</b> darker daily—and a dimple in the chin—a scowl on the brow—white skin—sweet voice—and a particular liking of Music—and of her own way in every thing—is that not B. all over?" [...] The child had forgotten any English she had learned and now spoke only Venetian Italian. In March 1820, he complained in a letter that three-year-old Allegra was vain and [...] "obstinate as a mule". Her behaviour was sometimes unmanageable, probably as a result of her unstable living arrangements and frequent changes in caregivers. [...] At age four, the naughty child terrorised Byron's servants with her temper tantrums and other misbehavior and told frequent lies.|$|E
