5|$|Agrippa's {{death in}} 12BC {{elevated}} Tiberius and Drusus {{with respect to}} the succession. At Augustus’ request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married Julia the Elder, Augustus' daughter and Agrippa's widow. Tiberius was very reluctant to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> as Julia had made advances to him when she was married and Tiberius was happily married. His new marriage with Julia was happy at first, but turned sour.|$|E

5|$|Another {{objective}} {{to finding}} and defeating Malkil in Wizards & WarriorsIII {{is to find}} four secret gems which will unlock the hidden passage through the town of Piedup to the castle's throne room where the evil wizard is located. To <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> Kuros must rescue King James' three princesses who are hidden somewhere in Piedup; each of them will grant Kuros a gem and agree to marry him when rescued. The final gem is obtained by defeating a dragon in the town's underworld.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{theory has}} some symmetry, as semen {{movements}} carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is {{hot enough to}} overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; {{but if it is}} too cold to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E
5|$|East of the NK and ROK 8th Divisions, the NK 12th Division {{crossed the}} Naktong River at Andong, {{moving through the}} {{mountains}} in small groups to reach P'ohang-dong. The division was far under strength {{and at least one}} of its artillery batteries had to send its guns back north because it had no ammunition for them. UN planners had not anticipated that the 12th Division would be able to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> effectively, and thus was unprepared when its forces infiltrated the region so heavily.|$|E

5000|$|Often people, {{especially}} computer engineers, {{focus on}} the machines. They think, [...] "By <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> the machine will run fast.

5|$|Even {{after this}} loss, England {{could have kept}} their chances alive by winning their final pool match against Spain. However, {{they were unable to}} <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> losing 1–0, and {{finishing}} the First Round with a record of 1–0–2. The U.S. also lost their next match 5–2, versus Chile, ending their 1950 World Cup run with a First Round record of 1–0–2. They would not qualify for the World Cup again until 1990. Spain advanced to the four-team Final Round, finishing fourth. Uruguay won the 1950 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes {{resolved}} to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> taking {{the greater part}} of the army with him. Mardonius handpicked the troops who were to remain with him in Greece, taking the elite infantry units and cavalry, to complete the conquest of Greece. All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, however, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt city for the winter.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sulfur}} cycle, archaea that grow by {{oxidizing}} sulfur compounds release this element from rocks, making it available to other organisms. However, the archaea that <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> such as Sulfolobus, produce sulfuric acid as a waste product, {{and the growth}} of these organisms in abandoned mines can contribute to acid mine drainage and other environmental damage.|$|E
50|$|The {{cover for}} <b>Does</b> <b>This</b> Look Infected? {{features}} drummer Steve Jocz {{dressed up as}} a zombie. It was chosen months before the title was. The album was almost delayed by the label because the band members {{did not have a}} name for it on time until Whibley thought of the name <b>Does</b> <b>This</b> Look Infected?. The whole band laughed at the idea and chose it as their album title. The same thing is also used on the band's EP <b>Does</b> <b>This</b> Look Infected Too?, except Jocz was replaced with Whibley, also dressed as a zombie.|$|R
