40|$|The density {{changes in}} the {{components}} of the <b>incubated</b> <b>egg,</b> the embryo, and the embryo's body parts were measured in the course of 21 days of incubation. In the first two-thirds of the incubation period there is a sequence of increasing density among egg contents: amniotic fluid, embryo, yolk, and albumin. As a result, the embryo is located {{at the bottom of the}} amniotic fluid, but at the top of the albumin. This position provides the embryo with mechanical protection and a proximity to the egg's air cell. The observed density changes and the asymmetry of these changes among various body parts of the embryo suggest a functional relationship. The density distributions among the body parts are particularly important in gravitational investigations of embryogenesis since they will produce forces tending to dislocate parts of the embryo...|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{environment}} and tolerance of eggs and embryos of western gulls (Larus occidentalis wymani) on San Nicolas Island, California, were determined. <b>Incubated</b> <b>egg</b> temperature measured by telemetry ranged between 30 and 36 C and averaged 33. 4 and 34. 2 C for two different nests; the former underwent pronounced cycles of heating {{during the day}} and cooling at night. Exposed eggs underwent a daily thermal excursion between 6 and 50 C. Embryos could maintain heartbeat between 11 and 46 C. Eggs which are exposed to solar radiation heat slowly (about 5 C/h). Diurnal exposure during parental absence does not, therefore, result in embryonic mortality unless exposure persists for several hours. Embryos recover completely after overnight exposure to relatively cool temperatures. Short-term exposure does not, therefore, constitute an immediate threat to embryonic survival.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to determine which factor influences weight at hatch of broiler chicks: breeder age or <b>incubated</b> <b>egg</b> weight. In Experiment 1, 2340 eggs produced by 29 - and 55 -week-old Ross® broiler breeders were incubated. The eggs selected for incubation weighed one standard deviation below and above average egg weight. In Experiment 2, 2160 eggs weighing 62 g produced by breeders of both ages were incubated. In both experiments, 50 additional eggs within the weight interval determined for each breeder age were weighed, broken, and their components were separated and weighed. At hatch, hatchlings were sexed and weighed, determining the average initial weight of the progeny of each breeder age. Data were analyzed using the Analyst program of SAS® software package. In Experiment 1, the weight difference between eggs produced by young and mature breeders was 10. 92 g, and the component that mostly influenced this difference was the yolk (7. 51 g heavier in mature breeders, compared with 4. 23 g difference in albumen and 0. 8 g in eggshell weights). Hatchling weight difference was 9. 4 g higher in eggs from mature breeders. In Experiment 2, egg weight difference was only 0. 74 g, but yolk weight was 4. 59 g higher in the eggs of mature breeders.

40|$|Incubation of NAD+ with {{extracts}} from sea urchin eggs resulted in {{production of a}} metabolite which could mobilize intracellular Ca 2 + stores of the eggs. In this study we present structural evidence indicating that the metabolite is a cyclized ADP-ribose having an N-glycosyl linkage between the anomeric carbon of the terminal ribose unit and the N 6 -amino group of the adenine moiety. In view of this structure we propose cyclic ADP-ribose as the common name for the metabolite. The purification procedure for the metabolite consisted of deproteinizing the <b>incubated</b> <b>egg</b> extracts and sequentially chromatographing the extracts through three different high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) columns. The homogeneity of the purified metabolite was further verified by HPLC on a Partisil 5 SAX column. Using radioactive precursor NAD+ with label at various positions it was demonstrated that the metabolite was indeed derived from NAD+ and that the adenine ring {{as well as the}} adenylate α-phosphate were retained in the metabolite whereas the nicotinamide group was removed. This was confirmed by 1 H NMR and two-dimensional COSY experiments, which also allowed the identification of all 12 protons on the two ribosyl units as well as the two protons on the adenine ring. From the chemical shifts of the two anomeric protons it was concluded that the C- 1 carbons of both ribosyl units were still bonded to nitrogen. The positive and negative ion fast atom bombardment mass spectra showed (M + Na) +, (M - H + 2 Na) +, (M - H) -, and (M - 2 H + Na) - peaks at m/z 564, 586, 540, and 562, respectively. Exact mass measurements indicated a molecular weight of 540. 0526 for (M - H) -. This together with the constraints imposed by the results from NMR, radioactive labeling, and total phosphate determination uniquely specified a molecular composition of C 15 H 21 N 5 O 13 P 2. Analysis by 1 H NMR and mass spectroscopy of the only major breakdown product of the metabolite after prolonged incubation at room temperature established that it was ADP-ribose, thus providing strong support for the cyclic structure. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The Tachinid fly, Palexorista laxa (Curran) is an {{important}} parasitoid of Heliothis armigera (Hubner) in Africa and India. The biological characteristics of the parasitoid were studied {{with an emphasis on}} its host instar preference, host range, seasonality and percentage parasitism. The developmental stages were also studied and described. A high host mortality (48 %- 100 %) due to parasite attack occurred when small larvae were parasitised (2 nd & 3 rd instars). A preference for the 4 th and 5 th host instars was shown by the flies. P. laxa was found to be a non-specific parasitoid and parasitised a number of lepidopterous larvae in the laboratory including Busseola fusca (Fuller), Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) and Eldana saccharina Walker, but preferred Ii. armigera. The percentage parasitism on H. armigera in the field was variable peaking at 48 % in 1988 / 89. Of the various parasitoids recorded from H. armigera on sunflower P. laxa was by far the most abundant. Mating occurred immediately after emergence with the males emerging a day earlier than the females. Males were capable of multiple matings whereas females mated only once in a lifetime. P. laxa females produced incubated macrotype eggs which hatched almost immediately after oviposition. The duration of development of the <b>incubated</b> <b>egg</b> and larval stage was 6, 7 days, the pupa 10, 4 days for females and 9, 4 days for males, and the adult lived up to 50 days at 25 °C. A reduction in pupal weight, an increase in the duration of the pupal stage and higher pupal mortality accompanied an increase in density of parasitoids per host. A linear relationship was shown between adult mass and number of ovarioles and eggs in P. laxa females. The oviposition period was 26, 9 days with a high variation in daily progeny production. The total fertility per female was 126, 3 puparia. "Inexperienced" females deposited incubated eggs on all parts of the host body while "experienced" females confined oviposition to the head and thorax. P. laxa females did not discriminate between previously parasitised and non-parasitised hosts. The effect of temperature on larval and pupal survival and development time was studied at 20 °, 22 °, 25 °, 28 °and 30 °C. As expected, duration of development decreased with an increase in temperature, and there was a reduction in mortality...|$|E

40|$|Microbial {{infection}} {{is a critical}} source of mortality for early life stages of oviparous vertebrates, but parental defenses against infection are less well known. Avian incubation has been hypothesized {{to reduce the risk}} of trans-shell infection by limiting microbial growth of pathogenic bacteria on eggshells, while enhancing growth of commensal or beneficial bacteria that inhibit or competitively exclude pathogens. We tested this hypothesis by comparing bacterial assemblages on naturally incubated and experimentally unincubated eggs at laying and late incubation using a universal 16 S rRNA microarray containing probes for over 8000 bacterial taxa. Before treatment, bacterial assemblages on individual eggs from both treatment groups were dissimilar to one another, as measured by clustering in non-metric dimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination space. After treatment, assemblages of unincubated eggs were similar to one another, but those of <b>incubated</b> <b>eggs</b> were not. Furthermore, assemblages of unincubated eggs were characterized by high abundance of six indicator species while <b>incubated</b> <b>eggs</b> had no indicator species. Bacterial taxon richness remained static on <b>incubated</b> <b>eggs,</b> but increased significantly on unincubated eggs, especially in several families of Gram-negative bacteria.

Thus 480 female and 48 male Ross breeder 18 -week-old birds were randomly distributed in 16 floor pens, with 30 females and three males in each one. The diets were based on corn and soybean meal, and all them were isoenergetics (2750 kcal ME/kg). The experimental design was a complete randomized block and the treatments were arranged in 2 × 2 factorial (CP × VE levels) with two repetitions each. Egg production/hen/day, egg weight, egg number/hen housed, viability, final female body weight and egg yolk percentage were not affected (P> 0. 05) by the treatments, and no interaction between CP and VE was observed. Hens fed diet with 16 % CP, supplemented with 25 or 250 mg VE/kg, had smaller egg shell and greater albumen percentage (P< 0. 05). Diet with 250 mg VE/kg resulted in greater alpha tocopherol concentration in the yolk (P< 0. 05).
