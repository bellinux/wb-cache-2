40|$|This {{work had}} as {{objective}} {{to compare the}} communities of Sminthuroidea and Onychiuridae (Collembola) among no-tillage in three fertility levels, conventional tillage and a natural ecosystem (native grassland). In the conventional tillage and in the no-tillage <b>in</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> medium fertility, the community of Sminthuroidea had regular fluctuation along {{the period of the}} experiment, but wtth low densities. The no-tillage <b>in</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> high fertility presented a populational pick in the autumn; the no-tillage <b>in</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> low fertility, <b>in</b> the spring; and, the natural ecosystem, in the summer.

40|$|A {{decrease}} <b>in</b> the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> occupancy of {{a species}} is often criterion by which a species is classified as threatened (i. e. IUCN Red List). However, {{it is unclear how}} to accurately measure change <b>in</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> occupancy. <b>Area</b> <b>of</b> occupancy is a measure of distribution and the spatial scale at which the distribution is measured will affect the ability to detect a decline. To overcome errors introduced by measuring distribution at different spatial scales, scale correction methods are often applied. It is known that scale correction reliably estimates <b>area</b> <b>of</b> occupancy; however, its suitability to estimate trends <b>in</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> occupancy has not been assessed. We investigate the effect of spatial scale and implementation of scale correction when estimating two different forms <b>of</b> decline <b>in</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> occupancy: spatially correlated and spatially uncorrelated declines. We explore these issues using simulations of three declining species and a grid-based monitoring method designed to detect the declines. Our results suggest that current grid-based methods are inadequate for detecting uncorrelated local extinctions, even if the total decline is substantial (e. g. 65 % of the original range). We demonstrate that scale correction will lead to misleading conclusions in some situations. We suggest an alternative survey method to accurately estimate changes <b>in</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> occupancy over time. We provide guidelines for designing grid surveys to measure changes <b>in</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> occupancy to assess a species threat status using the IUCN Red List criterion...|$|R
