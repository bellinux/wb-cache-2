5|$|In the <b>fountain</b> <b>effect,</b> {{a chamber}} is {{constructed}} which {{is connected to}} a reservoir of heliumII by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass. If {{the interior of the}} container is heated, the superfluid helium changes to non-superfluid helium. In order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of the container.|$|E

40|$|The current {{understanding}} {{of the effects of}} ground proximity on V/STOL and STOL aircraft is reviewd.

50|$|The ammonia {{fountain}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} demonstration. The experiment consists of introducing water through an inlet to a container filled with ammonia gas. Ammonia dissolves into the water and the pressure in the container drops.

5000|$|The water {{projection}} screens were initially designed {{with a single}} screen centered {{in front of the}} island. During development, show producers determined that the venue would need three screens to enable viewing along the entire waterfront. In addition to providing story development, the screens hide set changes. The pump house for the water screens and other <b>fountain</b> <b>effects</b> is located in the small structure along the river, just north of the Mark Twain dock. Water for the fountains is supplied via massive intake pipes directly under this structure. The fog system located around the banks of the river uses fresh water to create the fog effects along the river. The river's water itself is not suitable to be pumped through the mist nozzles, as aquashadow dye is added to the river to mask the bottom from guests.

40|$|International audienceNumerical {{simulations}} {{are widely}} used in polymer processing {{in order to understand}} the interaction between the material properties and the process. In the injection moulding process, one of the numerical simulation problems encountered is the tracking of the polymer-air front or interface during the filling stage [1]. In this study, this is achieved by using the classical level set method, which reveals to be conservative. On the contrary, in the case of confined volume of two phases flow, such as an air bubble moving in a constant volume of liquid, the method needs a correction in order to be conservative [2 - 3]. For a non-Newtonian non-isothermal flow, the simulation involves a coupling between heat transfer, continuity and momentum equations and the rheological material parameters. A finite element method is used to solve this equations set. The results show clearly the expected <b>fountain</b> flow <b>effect.</b> Temperature, velocity, pressure and viscosity fields are calculated and the influence of the thermal contact resistance between the polymer and the mould is presented...|$|R
