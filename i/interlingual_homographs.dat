Cross-linguistic effects of orthographic and semantic overlap between different languages of cognates and <b>interlingual</b> <b>homographs</b> were also reported in many priming studies. For example, Beauvillain and Grainger had French-English bilinguals make English lexical decisions on target strings primed by French words, which was told to the participants. The homographic primes were French words that were either semantically related to the English words (e.g., coin-money, where coin means corner in French) or not related. The results showed that the bilinguals responded faster in related conditions than unrelated conditions. Even though the participants knew that the prime words were always belonged to their French meaning, they were still affected by the English meaning of the homographic prime words. In the later studies, researchers masked the briefly presented prime words to prevent participants from using conscious strategies. For example, Sáchez-Casas et al. used Spanish-English bilinguals in a semantic categorization task on Spanish target words. They used three types of priming conditions: entirely identical cognates or non-cognates (rico-rico; pato-pato), translations of cognates or non-cognates (rich-rico; duck-pato) and non-word primes combined with cognate or non-cognate targets as a control condition (rict-rico vs. wuck-pato). They found that the bilinguals responded to the cognate translation conditions as fast as the identical conditions, but the non-cognate translation was as slow as the control conditions.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of <b>interlingual</b> <b>homographs</b> on lexical access in German-English bilinguals, when reading in their native language.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{regarding the}} representation of a bilingual's two languages is inconsistent. Some studies suggest selective bilingual language access (i. e., preferential access to one language), while others find non-selective bilingual language access (i. e., both languages are initially accessed simultaneously). In addition, {{little is known about}} such representations in the older bilingual speaker. In monolinguals, an age-related slowing in semantic activation may result from an inhibition deficit, which may limit the ability of older adults to ignore irrelevant information. Consequently, they may rely more heavily on compensatory strategies (e. g., context). This implies that bilingual older adults may rely more heavily on language context than young adults. We examined bilingual language selectivity and processing using both event-related brain potentials (the N 400) and response time measures in highly proficient bilingual young (18 - 35 years of age) and older (65 - 80 years of age) adults. Participants were presented with triplets of words consisting of a language context cue, an <b>interlingual</b> <b>homograph</b> (IH, i. e., a word with identical orthography but different meanings in two languages, e. g., COIN meaning 'corner' in French and 'money' in English), and a target, in a semantic priming paradigm. Language consistency between the cue and target were varied to investigate the effect of language context on the reading of an IH.

40|$|The {{paper is}} a {{presentation}} of the results of a qualitative formal analysis of different types of Serbo-Slovak interlingual approximates (false friends, interlingual homonyms). In his earlier research on Serbo-Slovak approximation, the author of this paper defined the appropriate terminology and the meaning of the notions similar and identical in terms of quantitative analysis. The results of the study are based on lexical material containing 266 pairs of Serbo-Slovak approximates. They have been classified into four groups – <b>interlingual</b> homonyms, homophones, <b>homographs</b> and paronyms. We found that the differences between approximates are similar in their nature within the groups they were classified into. The existence of these types of differences is possible due to the presence of numerous spelling principles in the Slovak orthography – which features a combination of the phonetic, morphological, grammatical and etymological principles. In the Serbian language, the phonetic principle is the only one consistently present, and the morphological principle can be seen only in a few exceptions. Orthoepic differences are closely related to the orthographic ones. In addition, we can distinguish other kinds of differences which result from a different etymological development or are accidental. Comparing and understanding differences gives a comprehensive and clear view of the formal differentiation of Serbo-Slovak interlingual approximation...|$|R
40|$|One {{key issue}} in {{bilingualism}} is how bilinguals control production, particularly to produce {{words in the}} less dominant language. Language switching is one method to investigate control processes. Language switching has been much studied in comprehension, e. g., in lexical decision task, but less so in production. Here we first present a study of language switching in Italian–English adult bilinguals in a naming task for visually presented words. We demonstrate an asymmetric pattern of time costs to switch language, where participants incurred a greater time cost to switch into naming in their dominant language (Italian). In addition, costs were greater where the stimuli were <b>interlingual</b> cognates or <b>homographs</b> than words existing in only one language, implicating lexical competition {{as a source of}} the cost. To clarify the operation of control processes, we then present two connectionist models of bilingual naming, based on the previous models of Seidenberg and McClelland (1989), Cohen, Dunbar and McClelland (1990), Gilbert and Shallice (2002), and Karaminis and Thomas (2010). Crucially, both models acquired their differential language dominance via an experience-dependent learning process. The models embody different assumptions about the language control processes that produce the switch cost. We consider which processing assumptions are sufficient to explain asymmetric language switch costs and word class effects on language switching in individual word reading, as well as generating novel predictions for future testing...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the time course of}} cross-language activation during word {{recognition in the}} context of semantic priming with <b>interlingual</b> <b>homographs.</b> Spanish-English bilinguals were presented pairs of English words visually one word at a time and judged whether the two words were related in meaning while recording event-related potentials (ERPs). <b>Interlingual</b> <b>homographs</b> (e. g., pie) appeared in the target position and were preceded by primes that were either related to the English meaning (e. g., apple), related to the Spanish meaning of <b>interlingual</b> <b>homographs</b> (e. g., toe) or totally unrelated (e. g., floor/bed). Spanish-English bilinguals showed semantic priming not only when <b>interlingual</b> <b>homographs</b> were related to the English meaning but also to the Spanish meaning of the prime. These priming effects were detectable in the mean amplitude of the N 400 (350 - 500 ms) even when the target word was related to the prime in Spanish and the context of the experiment was English. However, the relatedness effect survived into the window of a late positive component, LPC (550 - 700 ms) only for stimulus pairs related in English. To verify that the observed pattern of the results was due to participants’ bilingualism, we also tested a group of English monolinguals. The monolinguals showed a semantic priming effect for the N 400 and LPC time windows only when <b>interlingual</b> <b>homographs</b> were related to the English meaning. These results suggest that both languages are activated in the classical time frame of semantic activation indexed by N 400 modulations, but that semantic activation in the non-target language is subsequently inhibited...|$|E
40|$|A {{large body}} of recent psycholinguistic {{research}} has focused on lexical retrieval as a selective vs. non-selective process. Much of the early research has examined this phenomenon by presenting words in isolation, or more recently in second language sentence context. Only more recently has research placed more emphasis on how bilinguals are affected by the knowledge of multiple languages in native language processing. Cognitive changes are described to take place as a result of being multilingual (Van Assche, Duyck, Hartsuiker, & Diependaele, 2009). The goal of the current study was to shed further light on how second language knowledge can affect native language reading. This was achieved by observing native language reading behaviour of semantically neutral sentences that incorporated <b>interlingual</b> <b>homographs</b> (false friends), while eye-movements were recorded. These words can cause lexical ambiguity and can be compared to polysemous words in the monolingual domain.

40|$|To {{investigate}} decision level processes {{involved in}} bilingual word recognition tasks, Dutch-English participants had to name Dutch-English homographs in English.

Dutch naming latencies were slower than or equally slow as English naming latencies. In a stimulus list containing only English words and homographs, there was no homograph effect in naming latencies, although homographs did elicit more errors than control words. The results are interpreted as the consequence of list-induced variability in the competition between lexical items of the two languages involved. In addition, two additional decision processes have to be assumed: a language check, and a response deadline for non-target language responses...|$|E
40|$|In {{a foreign}} country where an {{unfamiliar}} language is spoken, words such as hotel, taxi, and café can often still be recognized because they possess the same or a similar spelling and meaning across languages.

These items are called false friends or (noncognate) <b>interlingual</b> <b>homographs.</b> An example is the word spot, which means “mockery ” in Dutch. Apart from spelling (or-thography) and meaning (semantics), a third code thought {{to play a major role}} in word processing is sound (phonol-ogy), which can also be shared between words of different languages.

40|$|How do the two {{languages}} of bilingual individuals interact in everyday communication? Numerous behavioral- and event-related brain potential {{studies have suggested}} that information from the non-target language is spontaneously accessed when bilinguals read, listen, or speak in a given language.

These paradigms will have yielded different language processing contexts, the effect of which has seldom been taken into consideration. We propose that future studies should test the effect of language context on cross-language interactions in a systematic way, by controlling and manipulating the extent to which the experiment implicitly or explicitly prompts activation of the two languages...|$|E
40|$|In three {{experiments}} {{we examined}} the effects of task demands and relative word frequency on the recognition of <b>interlingual</b> <b>homographs.</b> In all experiments, bilingual participants processed the same set of homographs embedded in identical mixed-language lists, but each experiment had different instructions. Homographs of three types were used: high-frequent in English and low-frequent in Dutch; low-frequent in English and high-frequent in Dutch; and low-frequent in both languages. In the first experiment (involving language decision), one button was pressed when an English word was presented and another button for a Dutch word. In the second and third experiments participants reacted only when they identified either an English word (English go/no-go) or a Dutch word (Dutch go/no-go). The results indicate that participants were able to exclude effects from the non-target language on homograph identification only to a limited degree. Target-language homographs were often "overlooked", especially if the frequency of their other-language competitor was high...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of the present study}} was to explore the {{involvement}} of inhibition in resolution of cross-language activation in bilingual comprehension and a possible modulatory effect of L 2 proficiency. We used a semantic relatedness judgment task in L 2 English that included Polish-English <b>interlingual</b> <b>homographs</b> and English translations of the Polish homographs' meanings. Based on previous studies using the same paradigm, we expected a strong homograph interference and inhibition of the homographs' Polish meanings translations. In addition, we predicted that participants with lower L 2 proficiency would experience greater interference and stronger inhibitory effects. The reported results confirm a strong homograph interference effect. In addition, our results indicate that the scope of inhibition generalized from the homograph's irrelevant meaning to a whole semantic category, indicating the flexibility of the inhibitory mechanisms. Contrary to our expectations, L 2 proficiency did not modulate the effects of interference and inhibition, possibly due to a relatively low variability in proficiency within our participant sample...|$|E
40|$|Current {{models of}} {{bilingualism}} (e. g., BIA) posit that lexical access during reading is not language selective. However, {{much of this}} research is based on the comprehension of words in isolation. The authors investigated whether nonselective access occurs for words embedded in biased sentence contexts (e. g., A. I. Schwartz & J. F. Kroll, 2006). Eye movements were recorded as French–English bilinguals read English sentences containing cognates (e. g., piano), <b>interlingual</b> <b>homographs</b> (e. g., coin, meaning corner in French), or matched control words. Sentences provided a low or high semantic constraint for target-language meanings. Both early-stage comprehension measures (e. g., first fixation duration, gaze duration, and skipping) and late-stage comprehension measures (e. g., go-past time and total reading time) showed significant cognate facilitation and interlingual homograph interference for low-constraint sentences. For high-constraint sentences, however, only early-stage comprehension measures were consistent with nonselective access. There was no evidence of cognate facilitation or interlingual homograph interference for late-stage comprehension measures. Thus, nonselective bilingual lexical access at early stages of comprehension is rapidly resolved in semantically biased contexts at later stages of comprehension...|$|E
40|$|Dutch-English bilinguals {{performed}} a generalized lexical decision task on triplets of items, responding with "yes" if all three items were correct Dutch and/or English words, and with "no" if {{one or more}} of the items was not a word in either language. Sometimes the second item in a triplet was an interlingual homograph whose English meaning was semantically related to the third item of the triplet (e. g., HOUSE - ANGEL - HEAVEN, where ANGEL means "sting" in Dutch). In such cases, the first item was either an exclusively English (HOUSE) or an exclusively Dutch (ZAAK) word. Semantic priming effects were found in on-line response times. Event-related potentials that were recorded simultaneously showed N 400 priming effects thought to reflect semantic integration processes. The response time and N 400 priming effects were not affected by the language of the first item in the triplets, providing evidence in support of a strong bottom-up role with respect to bilingual word recognition. The results are interpreted in terms of the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA) model, a language nonselective access model assuming bottom-up priority.

40|$|Using a {{semantic}} priming paradigm, {{this study examines}} the effects of semantic and lexical-ortho graphic context on reaction times (RTs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) for <b>interlingual</b> <b>homographs.</b> Dutch-English bilinguals performed an English lexical decision task in which homographs like STEM (meaning "voice" in Dutch) were preceded by primes like ROOT or FOOL that were semantically related or unrelated to the English reading of the target word. Homographs were responded to faster following semantically related primes than following unrelated primes. The responses in both conditions were modulated by the relative frequencies of the two readings of the homographs: responses were faster when their English word frequency was high or when their Dutch word frequency was low. In the ERPs, N 400 effects, taken to reflect processes of semantic integration, were found for homographs preceded by related primes. Remarkably, the amplitude of the N 400 effect was also modulated by word frequency in both the first (Dutch, L 1) and the second (English, L 2) language. The observed relationship between lexical and semantic variables supports a model for bilingual semantic priming that extends the language nonselective BIA+ model for bilingual word recognition...|$|E
40|$|Although most bilinguals can {{translate}} with relative ease, the underlying neuro-cognitive processes are poorly understood. Using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) we investigated the temporal course of word translation. Participants translated words from {{and to their}} first (L 1, Dutch) and second (L 2, English) language while ERPs were recorded. <b>Interlingual</b> <b>homographs</b> (IHs) were included to introduce language conflict. IHs share orthographic form but have different meanings in L 1 and L 2 (e. g., room in Dutch refers to cream). Results showed that the brain distinguished between translation directions as early as 200 ms after word presentation: the P 2 amplitudes were more positive in the L 1 L 2 translation direction. The N 400 was also modulated by translation direction, with more negative amplitudes in the L 2 L 1 translation direction. Furthermore, the IHs were translated more slowly, induced more errors, and elicited more negative N 400 amplitudes than control words. In a naming experiment, participants read aloud the same words in L 1 or L 2 while ERPs were recorded. Results showed no effect of either IHs or language, suggesting that task schemas may be crucially related to language control in translation. Furthermore, translation appears to involve conceptual processing in both translation directions, and the task goal appears to influence how words are processed. ...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{explores the}} {{cognitive}} operations underlying word recognition {{and production of}} late bilingual adults in their second language (L 2). Experimental psychology and electrophysiology have made a case for the activation ofthe first language (Ll) when bilingual individuals process words in L 2. Evidence for cross-language activation has shaped current models of bilingual lexical processing and influenced our conception ofthe bilingual lexicon. However, previous studies have made extensive use of interlinguallexical stimuli (e. g., cognates, <b>interlingual</b> <b>homographs)</b> and/or translation equivalents to compare L 1 and L 2 processing in bilingual individuals. Experiments mixing stimuli from two languages create an artificial context which may differ significantly from real-life situations and bias behavioural performances toward a language-nonselective processing pattern. In the present thesis we tested bilingual participants reading, listening to, and producing words exclusively in their L 2. In the first experiment series, Chinese-English bilinguals read and listened to pairs of English words, half of which shared a character repetition in their Chinese translations. Evidence of event-related potentials (ERPs) showed that Chinese translations were accessed automatically and unconsciously. In the second experiment series, the same paradigm was used except that phonological and orthographic repetitions in, Chinese translations were independently tested. Significant priming was found for phonological but not orthographic repetitions,independently of the input modality (visual or aud ory), demonstrating that cross-language activation is mediated by phonology. In the third experiment series, speech production was studied using a covert picture naming paradigm involving rhyming decisions. Here again, L 1 access was detected but it was delayed in comparison to reading and listening in L 2. Moreover, cross-language activation in picture naming was asymmetric, featuring strong influences of L 1 on L 2, but no effect of L 2 on Ll. Findings of the thesis shed {{new light on the}} dynamic nature ofhilinguallanguage processing, as well as constraints affecting cross-language activation. Implications for current models ofhilinguallexical access are discussed...|$|E
