40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to understand the influence of fibre surface treatment as well as yarn twist on the tensile properties of unidirectional (UD) jute polyester composites. Jute and polyester are chosen in this work as both are cheap. As received jute yarn, physical and chemical surface treated jute yarn and raw jute fibre are used to manufacture UD composites. Physical surface treatment includes removing yarn hairs, sizing by hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), water treatment, sizing by cellulose nano-particle (CNP) and chemical treatment includes mercerisation with and without applying tension. Composites manufactured with unsized <b>hairy</b> <b>yarn</b> show an increase in tensile modulus {{and a decrease in}} strain at failure compared to composites manufactured with unsized hairless yarn in the longitudinal direction. However yarn hairs do not affect the tensile strength of composites. Application of HEC improves the tensile properties of composites with respect to composites manufactured with unsized yarn. Water treatment of yarn with tension enhances the tensile properties of composites and water treatment of yarn without tension decreases the tensile properties of composite with respect to composites manufactured with untreated yarn. Similar to water treatment, composites manufactured with alkali treated yarn with tension show higher tensile strength with respect to composites manufactured with alkali treated yarn without tension. Non-dried CNP treatment of yarn improves the tensile properties of composites. Composites manufactured with raw fibres have increased tensile properties with respect to composites manufactured with twisted yarn...|$|E
5000|$|Staple {{length is}} an {{important}} criterion for spinning fibre, as shorter fibres {{are more difficult to}} spin than longer ones, so staple length varies from short to longer length fibres, short fibers also resulting in more <b>hairy</b> <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
40|$|Yarn {{tension is}} a key factor that affects the {{efficiency}} of a ring spinning system. In this paper, a specially constructed rig, which can rotate a yarn at a high speed without inserting any real twist into the yarn, was used to simulate a ring spinning process. Yarn tension was measured at the guide-eye during the simulated spinning of different yarns at various balloon heights and with varying yarn length in the balloon. The effect of balloon shape, yarn hairiness and thickness, and yarn rotating speed, on the measured yarn tension, was examined. The {{results indicate that the}} collapse of balloon shape from single loop to double loop, or from double loop to triple etc, lead to sudden reduction in yarn tension. Under otherwise identical conditions, a longer length of yarn in the balloon gives a lower yarn tension at the guide-eye. In addition, thicker <b>yarns</b> and/or more <b>hairy</b> <b>yarns</b> generate a higher tension in the yarn, due to the increased air drag acting on the thicker or more <b>hairy</b> <b>yarns...</b>|$|R
30|$|Among 150  g/m 2 fabrics of {{different}} materials (i.e. sample A, B and C) air permeability is highest for 100 % polyester filament fabric because of smooth and hairiness free <b>yarns</b> (Table  3). <b>Hairy</b> <b>yarns</b> in 100 % cotton and cotton blends offers more {{resistance to air flow}} and therefore lead to lower air permeability. Among plain, twill and satin fabrics of 200  g/m 2 weight (i.e. sample D, E and F), satin woven fabric offers highest air permeability, whereas twill fabric shows the least. This {{is due to}} the longer floats and larger pore sizes (Table  2) in satin structure. Twill fabric with compact structure offer the lowest air permeability. Further, air permeability decreases as the fabric weight increases due to compact structure with smaller pores and higher thickness.|$|R
5000|$|In general, {{there is}} little risk of {{unravelling}} the sweater with a steek cut if the sewn or crocheted line has been done with wool yarn that is not superwash. They can be further strengthened by using a sticky <b>hairy</b> animal <b>yarn</b> (Shetland wool, the traditional choice, is a good example), and using frequent color changes (such as a 1x1 rib or a check pattern) to secure the yarn. In addition, {{the sides of the}} steek can be reinforced by crocheting or sewing.|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{compared}} fiber trapping of embeddable and locatable spinning (ELS) {{with that of}} sirofil and siro core-spinning with flute pipe air suction. Online pictorial analysis showed that the 3 rd ELS was free of the visual fiber loss during the 1 st ELS, 2 nd ELS, sirofil, and siro core-spinning. This indicated the 3 rd ELS possessed high ability of trapping staple fibers. Weight loss of different yarns proved that the 3 rd ELS had a statistically higher fiber trapping capacity than 1 st ELS, sirofil and siro core-spinning. Yarn visual appearance results showed that filaments failed to be entirely buried in the siro core-spun yarn body due to the staple fiber loss and imperfect filament tension adjustment. Poor trapping and filament fasting of staple fibers might be the reasons for more <b>hairy</b> siro core-spun <b>yarn</b> than other composite yarns. Sirofil and siro core-spun yarn had higher value of coefficient of mass variation per unit yarn length and yarn imperfections than the 3 rd ELS yarn which might be probably due to their irregular fiber loss during the sirofil and siro core-spinning. The fiber loss {{would result in a}} decrease in yarn cross-section fiber utilization; therefore, sirofil, siro core-spun and the 1 st ELS yarn had a statistically lower tensile tenacity than the 3 rd ELS composite yarn. ...|$|R
