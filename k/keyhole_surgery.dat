5|$|Another area of {{interest}} is in assessing whether <b>keyhole</b> <b>surgery</b> (laparoscopy) {{would be better than}} Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes after surgery has led to a number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E
5|$|His injury {{problems}} {{started as}} early as 1980, when he was 15 years old and saw Glentoran's physio Bobby McGregor to resolve a groin strain; Whiteside said that the highly physical massage he was subjected to damaged his pelvis and robbed him of his natural pace. His lack of pace was later seen as the one weakness in his game. Six weeks into his apprenticeship, in July 1981, and an innocuous looking challenge by a Preston North End player in an 'A' team game saw Whiteside requiring an operation on his right knee. Had the injury occurred {{a couple of years}} later he would have been able to have pioneering <b>keyhole</b> <b>surgery,</b> which could potentially have saved his career. After a seven-month lay-off and a further operation to remove cartilage, he returned to fitness in January 1982.

5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (<b>keyhole</b> <b>surgery)</b> is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E

40|$|AIM: Keyhole {{endoscopy}} is {{a promising}} therapeutic option for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We sought {{to compare the}} clinical outcomes between <b>keyhole</b> endoscopy <b>surgery</b> and craniotomy for basal ganglia ICH. MATERIAL and METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical and radiographic data obtained in 28 keyhole endoscopic procedures and 30 craniotomy procedures. Hematoma evacuation rate, infection rate, rebleeding and mean operation time were recorded as primary end points. Outcome Scale (GOS) values were recorded at the 3 -month postoperative follow-up. The operation time from symptom onset is also studied between < 8 hours group and 8 - 24 hours group. RESULTS: The evacuation rate was significantly higher in the endoscopy group compared with the craniotomy group (P< 0. 05), and infectious rate was lower in the endoscopy group compared with the craniotomy group(P< 0. 05). Mortality rates between the 2 groups did not show statistically significant differences. The patients operated within 8 h had better outcome (GOS 4 and 5) than that operated between 8 - 24 h (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The data indicate that in patients with ICH, <b>keyhole</b> endoscopic <b>surgery</b> is safe and feasible, while operation within 8 h can promote recovery of patients. These preliminary results warrant further study in a large, prospective, randomized trial in the near future...|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} surgical procedures {{that can be}} employed to treat ovarian cancer. For stage I and II cancer, laparascopic (<b>keyhole)</b> <b>surgery</b> can be used, but metastases may not be found. For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending {{on the extent of}} the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system, omentectomy, splenectomy, bowel resection, diaphragm stripping or resection, appendectomy, or even a posterior pelvic exenteration.|$|E
25|$|To {{definitively}} diagnose ovarian cancer, {{a surgical}} procedure {{to inspect the}} abdomen is required. This can be an open procedure (laparotomy, incision through the abdominal wall) or <b>keyhole</b> <b>surgery</b> (laparoscopy).

Usually, this includes a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, removal of a single affected ovary and Fallopian tube. Fluid from the abdominal cavity can also be analyzed for cancerous cells. If cancer is found, this procedure {{can also be used}} to determine the extent of its spread (which is a form of tumor staging).|$|E

25|$|After {{his release}} by Tranmere Rovers, Nicholson rejoined Chesterfield on 29 June 2004, on a one-year contract. After giving some {{impressive}} performances during the 2004–05 season, scoring seven goals in 43 league appearances, Nicholson's contract was extended, but the captain's next season {{was cut short}} due to injury and needed emergency treatment to an infection in his leg following <b>keyhole</b> <b>surgery.</b> Prior to this injury, Nicholson had scored five goals in 25 league matches during the 2005–06 season.

40|$|During {{minimally}} invasive (<b>keyhole)</b> tumour resection <b>surgery,</b> the sentinel node is typically visualized by injecting an opaque dye into the tumour and monitoring uptake in the node via endoscopy. Conventional illumination methods for sentinel node mapping {{are limited to}} shallow penetration depths causing nodes below fat tissue to be overlooked. This paper reports {{on the development of}} novel optical techniques for the implementation of a spectrally-agile laparoscopic system capable of identifying near-infrared fluorescence from clinically-approved fluorescent dyes. The construction of a tuneable illumination unit is described; this combines a series of near-infrared laser diodes with conventional visible light for fluorescence excitation and sample illumination respectively. Additionally, a methodology based on a micro-lens approach for separating near-infrared fluorescence images from conventional colour images at the laparoscope's eyepiece with minimal distortions is presented. Near-infrared detection methods based on optical multichannel analyzers are discussed, with special consideration given to their commercial availability and potential for endoscopic applications in the abdominal, gastrointestinal and gynaecological cavities. In order to determine maximum penetration depths achievable with our system, Monte Carlo and analytic methods have been implemented to model photon transport through mammary fat tissue at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, revealing imaging sensitivity. Specifically, expected optical penetration depths at 690 nm, 732 nm, 785 nm and 830 nm are 2. 27 mm, 2. 90 mm, 3. 15 mm and 3. 26 mm respectively. In essence, laparoscopic assisted spectroscopy based on tuneable excitation and emission can be employed to increase sensitivity and specificity of sentinel node detection and may provide the additional benefit of differentiation between normal and cancerous tissue. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Complete {{surgical}} {{removal of}} the prostate, radical prostatectomy, is {{the most frequently used}} treatment option for men with localised prostate cancer. The use of laparoscopic (<b>keyhole)</b> and robot-assisted <b>surgery</b> has improved operative safety but the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these options remains uncertain. Objective: This study aimed to determine the relative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of robotic radical prostatectomy compared with laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in the treatment of localised prostate cancer within the UK NHS. Data sources: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Science Citation Index and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1995 until October 2010 for primary studies. Conference abstracts from meetings of the European, American and British Urological Associations were also searched. Costs were obtained from NHS sources and the manufacturer of the robotic system. Economic model parameters and distributions not obtained in the systematic review were derived from other literature sources and an advisory expert panel. Review methods: Evidence was considered from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised comparative studies of men with clinically localised prostate cancer (cT 1 or cT 2); outcome measures included adverse events, cancer related, functional, patient driven and descriptors of care. Two reviewers abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. For meta-analyses, a Bayesian indirect mixed-treatment comparison was used. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using a discrete-event simulation model. Results: The searches identified 2722 potentially relevant titles and abstracts, from which 914 reports were selected for full-text eligibility screening. Of these, data were included from 19, 064 patients across one RCT and 57 non-randomised comparative studies, with very few studies considered at low risk of bias. The results of this study, although associated with some uncertainty, demonstrated that the outcomes were generally better for robotic than for laparoscopic surgery for major adverse events such as blood transfusion and organ injury rates and for rate of failure to remove the cancer (positive margin) (odds ratio 0. 69; 95...|$|R
40|$|Background: Positive {{surgical}} margins (PSMs) are a known {{risk factor}} for biochemical recurrence in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and are potentially affected by surgical technique and volume. Objective: To investigate whether radical prostatectomy (RP) modality and volume affect PSM rates. Design, setting, and participants: Fourteen institutions in Europe, the United States, and Australia {{were invited to participate}} in this study, all of which retrospectively provided margins data on 9778 open RP, 4918 laparoscopic RP, and 7697 robotic RP patients operated on between January 2000 and October 2011. Outcome measurements and statistical analyses: The outcome measure was PSM rate. Multivariable logistic regression analyses and propensity score methods identified odds ratios for risk of a PSM for one modality compared with another, after adjustment for age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, postoperative Gleason score, pathologic stage, and year of surgery. Classic adjustment using standard covariates was also implemented to compare PSM rates based on center volume for each minimally invasive surgical cohort. Results and limitations: Open RP patients had higher-risk PCa at time of surgery on average and were operated on earlier in the study time period on average, compared with minimally invasive cohorts. Crude margin rates were lowest for robotic RP (13. 8 %), intermediate for laparoscopic RP (16. 3 %), and highest for open RP (22. 8 %); significant differences persisted, although were ameliorated, after statistical adjustments. Lower-volume centers had increased risks of PSM compared with the highest-volume center for both laparoscopic RP and robotic RP. The study is limited by its nonrandomized nature; missing data across covariates, especially year of surgery in many of the open cohort cases; lack of standardized histologic processing and central pathology review; and lack of information regarding potential confounders such as patient comorbidity, nerve-sparing status, lymph node status, tumor volume, and individual surgeon caseload. Conclusions: This multinational, multi-institutional study of 22 393 patients after RP suggests that PSM rates might be lower after minimally invasive techniques than after open RP and that PSM rates are affected by center volume in laparoscopic and robotic cases. Patient summary: In this study, we compared the effectiveness of different types of surgery for prostate cancer by looking at the rates of cancer cells left at the margins of what was removed in the operations. We compared open, <b>keyhole,</b> and robotic <b>surgery</b> from many centers across the globe and found that robotic and keyhole operations appeared to have lower margin rates than open surgeries. How many cases a center and surgeon do seems to affect this rate for both robotic and keyhole procedures. © 2013 European Association of Urology...|$|R

2500|$|In {{hereditary}} angioedema, often {{no direct}} cause is identifiable, although mild trauma, including dental work and other stimuli, can cause attacks. There is usually no associated itch or urticaria, {{as it is}} not an allergic response. [...] Patients with HAE can also have recurrent episodes (often called [...] "attacks") of abdominal pain, usually accompanied by intense vomiting, weakness, and in some cases, watery diarrhea, and an unraised, nonitchy splotchy/swirly rash. [...] These stomach attacks can last one to five days on average, and can require hospitalization for aggressive pain management and hydration. Abdominal attacks have also been known to cause {{a significant increase in the}} patient's white blood cell count, usually in the vicinity of 13,000 to 30,000. [...] As the symptoms begin to diminish, the white count slowly begins to decrease, returning to normal when the attack subsides.
