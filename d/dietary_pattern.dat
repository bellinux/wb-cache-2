40|$|Abstract Background Studies of the {{associations}} between diet and depression have primarily focused on single nutrients or foods. Recently, <b>dietary</b> <b>patterns</b> representing {{a combination of}} foods have attracted more interest than individual nutrient. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the association between <b>dietary</b> <b>patterns</b> and depressive symptoms among a community-dwelling population in Japan. Methods We examined the association between <b>dietary</b> <b>patterns</b> and the risk of depression among 791 Japanese community-dwelling individuals. Diet was assessed with a validated brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ). <b>Dietary</b> <b>patterns</b> from 52 predefined food groups [energy-adjusted food (g/d) ] were extracted by principal component analysis. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) with a cut-off point of 16 was used to assess the prevalence of depression. Results A total of 97 subjects (12. 3 %) were classified as having depression. Four <b>dietary</b> <b>patterns</b> were identified: “Healthy”, “Western”, “Bread and confectionery”, and “Alcohol and accompanying” <b>dietary</b> <b>patterns.</b> After adjusting for potential confounders, the <b>dietary</b> <b>patterns</b> were not related to the risk of depression. Conclusions The present study failed to find associations between <b>dietary</b> <b>patterns</b> and the risk of depression. However, the interpretation of our results was hampered by the lack of certain data, including employment physical activity and longitudinal observations. Potential associations between <b>dietary</b> <b>patterns</b> and depressive symptoms were not completely ruled out. Future research exploring <b>dietary</b> <b>patterns</b> and depressive symptoms is warranted. </p...|$|R

The study objective was to characterise the development of <b>dietary</b> <b>patterns</b> from 9 - 36 mo of age and investigate the association to body size, body composition and metabolic risk markers at 36 mo. Food records were filled out at 9, 18 and 36 mo of age (n = 229). <b>Dietary</b> <b>patterns</b> were identified by principal component analysis (PCA). Three <b>dietary</b> <b>patterns</b> were identified: Transition Food, Healthy Food and Traditional Food. The course of development in <b>dietary</b> <b>patterns</b> from 9 - 36 mo indicated tracking for a relatively large group of participants in the three patterns. Transition Food and Healthy Food were associated with some of the investigated outcomes. Children with lower adherence to the Transition Food pattern than average at 18 and 36 mo irrespectively of intake at 9 mo had higher BMI z-scores at 36 mo. Similar trend was identified for higher fat mass indices. Children with lower adherence to the Healthy Food pattern than average at all three ages compared to children with higher adherence to the Healthy Food pattern at the first two registrations, 9 and 18 mo had higher total cholesterol and LDL.

RESULTS: Four <b>dietary</b> <b>patterns</b> were extracted at both 6 and 15 months.

At 6 months, the fourth pattern was characterized predominantly by breastfeeding and at 15 months, by contemporary-style foods including herbs, legumes, nuts, raw fruit and vegetables. Higher maternal age and education, number of siblings and lower body mass index (BMI) was associated with higher scores on the breastfeeding or meat, vegetables and desserts patterns, whereas higher discretionary food pattern scores were associated with younger maternal age, lower education, higher BMI and more siblings.
