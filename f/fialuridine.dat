40|$|The toxicities of 2 ’-fluorouridine (2 ’-FU) and 2 ’-fluorocytidine-HCl (2 ’-FC) were {{separately}} {{evaluated in}} 2 species, male Fischer 344 (F 334) rats and woodchucks. Particular attention {{was focused on}} the ability of these nucleosides to induce toxicities similar to those induced by the antiviral drug <b>fialuridine</b> (FIAU). 2 ’-FU or 2 ’-FC was administered to F 344 male rats by intravenous injection at doses of 5, 50, and 500 mg/kg/day for 90 consecutive days and to male and female woodchucks at doses of 0. 75 and 7. 5 mg/kg/ day for 90 consecutive days. Clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis (woodchuck only) profiles were assessed during and at the termination of the study. At necropsy, organs were weighed and tissues collected for routine histologic analysis. Cytochrome c oxidase activity, citrate synthase activity, and mitochondrial DNA content were measured, and micronucleus formation in the bone marrow (rats only) was evaluated. No adverse clinical effects were observed in either species. Rats treated with high doses of either 2 ’-FU or 2 ’-FC had body weights that were 90 % of those of controls. 2 ’-FU and 2 ’-FC both induced a moderate decrease in the median lymphocyte count, and 2 ’-FC and 2 ’-FU induced a mild increase in mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume. Both compounds caused slight to moderate, reversible, histologic changes in the spleen and thymus. In the woodchuck, 2 ’-FC caused a slight increase in mean absolute lymphocytes, and 2 ’-FC and 2 ’-FU slightly increased hepatic periportal vacuolation and/ or mononuclear cell infiltration. In summary, neither compound showed evidence of the toxicity induced by <b>fialuridine</b> in eithe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Seven of 15 {{clinical}} trial participants {{treated with a}} nucleoside analogue (<b>fialuridine</b> [FIAU]) developed acute liver failure. Five treated participants died, and two required a liver transplant. Preclinical toxicology studies in mice, rats, dogs, and primates did not provide any indication that FIAU would be hepatotoxic in humans. Therefore, we investigated whether FIAU-induced liver toxicity could be detected in chimeric TK-NOG mice with humanized livers. Methods and Findings: Control and chimeric TK-NOG mice with humanized livers were treated orally with FIAU 400, 100, 25, or 2. 5 mg/kg/d. The response to drug treatment was evaluated by measuring plasma lactate and liver enzymes, by assessing liver histology, and by electron microscopy. After treatment with FIAU 400 mg/kg/d for 4 d, chimeric mice developed clinical and serologic evidence of liver failure and lactic acidosis. Analysis of liver tissue revealed steatosis in regions with human, but not mouse, hepatocytes. Electron micrographs revealed lipid and mitochondrial abnormalities in the human hepatocytes in FIAU-treated chimeric mice. Dose-dependent liver toxicity was detected in chimeric mice treated with FIAU 100, 25, or 2. 5 mg/kg/d for 14 d. Liver toxicity did not develop in control mice that were treated with the sam...|$|E
40|$|Drug-induced {{cholestasis}} (DIC) {{is recognized}} as one of the prime mechanisms for DILI. Hence, earlier detection of drug candidates with cholestatic signature is crucial. Recently, we introduced an in vitro model for DIC and evaluated its performance with several cholestatic drugs. We presently expand on the validation of this model by 14 training compounds (TCs) of the EU-EFPIA IMI project MIP-DILI. Several batches of human hepatocytes in sandwich-culture were qualified for DIC assessment by verifying the bile acid-dependent increase in sensitivity to the toxic effects of cyclosporin A. The cholestatic potential of the TCs was expressed by determining the drug-induced cholestasis index (DICI). A safety margin (SM) was calculated as the ratio of the lowest TC concentration with a DICI ≤ 0. 80 to the Cmax,total. Nefazodone, bosentan, perhexiline and troglitazone were flagged for cholestasis (SM < 30). The hepatotoxic (but non-cholestatic) compounds, amiodarone, diclofenac, <b>fialuridine</b> and ximelagatran, and all non-hepatotoxic compounds were cleared as “safe” for DIC. Tolcapone and paracetamol yielded DICI-based SM values equal to or higher than those based on cytotoxicity, thus excluding DIC as a DILI mechanism. This hepatocyte-based in vitro assay provides a unique tool for early and reliable identification of drug candidates with cholestasis risk. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Accumulation of the {{antiviral}} {{nucleoside analogue}} <b>fialuridine</b> (FIAU; 1 -(2 '-deoxy- 2 '-fluoro-beta-D-arab-inofuranosyl- 5 -iodouracil) in genomic DNA was examined with {{a modified version}} of a recently developed RIA for FIAU. DNA was obtained from tissues of dogs administered FIAU at 0, 1, 2, or 3 mg/kg of body weight per day for 90 days, monkeys administered FIAU at 0 or 25 mg/kg per day for 30 days, and rats administered FIAU at 0, 255, or 510 mg/kg per day for 70 days. FIAU incorporation was observed in all species. In the rat, FIAU was incorporated into DNA of all tissues examined, with highest concentrations in the liver followed by jejunum, spleen, and heart. FIAU was also incorporated into sperm DNA. Incorporation rates were as high as 11, 000 pmol of FIAU per mumol of thymidine or 1 FIAU molecule per 90 thymidine molecules. In dogs and rats, the extent of incorporation was dose-dependent. Across species, FIAU concentrations in DNA were not singly dependent on the total dose administered but also may have been dependent on the duration of exposure. These studies show that FIAU accumulates to high concentrations in genomic DNA of liver as well as other tissues during chronic oral administration and suggest that net accumulation of FIAU in DNA may be a critical step in FIAU-induced toxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{thymidine}} analog <b>fialuridine</b> deoxy- 2 -fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl) - 5 -iodouracil (FIAU) was toxic in {{trials for}} chronic hepatitis B infection. One mechanism postulated that defective mtDNA replication was mediated through inhibition of DNA polymerase-gamma (DNA pol-gamma), by FIAU triphosphate (FIALTP) or by triphosphates of FIAU metabolites. Inhibition kinetics and primer-extension analyses determined biochemical mechanisms of FIAU, 1 -(2 -deoxy- 2 -fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl) - 5 -methyluracil (FAU), 1 -(2 -deoxy- 2 -fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl) uracil triphosphate (TP) inhibition of DNA pol-gamma. dTMP incorporation by DNA pol-gamma was inhibited competitively by FIAUTP, FMAUTP, and FAUTP (K 1 = 0. 015, 0. 03, and 1. 0 microM, respectively). By using oliginucleotide template-primers. DNA pol-gamma incorporated each analog into DNA opposite a single adenosine efficiently without effects on DNA chain elongation. Incorporation of multiple adjacent analogs at positions of consecutive adenosines dramatically impaired chain elongation by DNA pol-gamma. Effects of FIAU, FMAU, and FAU on HepG 2 cell mmtDNA abundance and ultrastructure were determined. After 14 days, mtDNA decreased by 30 % with 20 microM FIAU or 20 microM FMAU and decreased less than 10 % with 100 microM FAU. FIAU and FMAU disrupted mitochondria and caused accumulation of intracytoplasmic lipid droplets. Biochemical and cell biological {{findings suggest that}} FIAU and its metabolites inhibit mtDNA replication, most likely at positions of adenosine tracts, leading to decreased mtDNA and mitochondrial ultrastructural defects...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fialuridine</b> (FIAU) is a halogen-substituted analog of {{thymidine}} {{that was}} undergoing clinical investigation {{as a drug}} {{for the treatment of}} chronic hepatitis B viral infection. However, clinical trials of FIAU were terminated after adverse events occurred following chronic oral administration. Prior to the termination of clinical trials, a sensitive assay was needed for the measurement of FIAU because of the anticipated low dose administered to patients. We therefore undertook the development of a radioimmunoassay (RIA). A specific antiserum was raised in rabbits following immunization with a 5 '-O-hemisuccinate analog of FIAU coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Radiolabeled FIAU was synthesized by a destannylation procedure by using sodium [125 I]iodide. We developed a competitive-binding procedure and used precipitation with polyethylene glycol as the method for separating the bound and free forms of FIAU. The RIA is sensitive (0. 2 ng/ml), specific (negligible interference from known metabolites and endogenous nucleosides), and reproducible (interassay coefficients of variation range from 5 to 19. 7 % for serum controls). We used the RIA to assess the pharmacokinetics of FIAU in healthy adult volunteers following administration of a single 5 -mg oral dose. The sensitivity of the RIA permitted the detection of a prolonged elimination phase for FIAU in healthy volunteers and dogs, with mean elimination half-lives of 29. 3 and 35. 3 h, respectively. We conclude the RIA is a valid method for the quantification of FIAU in biological fluids...|$|E
40|$|Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) is {{of major}} concern to both clinicians and the {{pharmaceutical}} industry due to the attrition of lead compounds during preclinical development and the incidence of hepatotoxicity and/or the withdrawal of drugs post marketing. It has been hypothesised that drug-induced mitochondrial dysfunction (DIMD) could be a causative factor of DILI. The nucleoside analogue <b>fialuridine</b> (FIAU) was withdrawn from use following a clinical trial in 1993 in which 5 patients died of hepatic failure. Subsequent {{research has shown that}} FIAU induces toxicity via mitochondrial DNA damage. However, current in vitro screening methods do not identify these compounds as toxic and thus this poses a problem to pre-clinical safety assessments. Three methods of metabolic modification, utilising glucose or galactose supplemented media and 2 DG were compared to define and monitor mitochondrial toxicity induced by FIAU, and positive control adefovir (ADEF), in HepG 2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cells. The structural isomer of <b>fialuridine,</b> (FIAU 2 ’ epimer) was included as a negative control. Mitochondrial toxicity could not be demonstrated in HepG 2 cells over a 7 -day period by any of these drugs. The HepaRG line is evident to be more hepatocyte-like than HepG 2 cells and therefore can overcome the limitations of the widely used HepG 2 cells. It is hypothesised that their increased primary human hepatocyte (PHH) like phenotypic characteristics may be more suitable for drug toxicity studies. Here, the utility of HepaRG based models in the detection of mitotoxicants was compared with previous research using a HepG 2 model. Bioenergetic phenotyping revealed that the HepaRG line is less metabolically active when compared to HepG 2 cells. HepaRG cells have the capacity to undergo metabolic modification using a short term glucose/galactose switch method and thus detect compounds with mitochondrial liabilities (EC 50 -ATPglu/EC 50 -ATPgal > 2). Following the assessment of 12 hepatotoxins it was concluded that the HepaRG line offered no increased sensitivity for the detection of mitotoxicants compared with HepG 2 cells. However, their stability in culture over extended periods (1 to 4 weeks) may be advantageous for the study of delayed toxicity. Therefore, HepaRG cells were further utilised in the assessment of FIAU induced mitochondrial toxicity, using an acute metabolic screen. Mitochondrial toxicity in the absence of cell death was demonstrated following 2 -week drug incubation. The measurement of cellular respiration (using Seahorse technology) demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in mitochondrial respiration {{in the absence of a}} decrease in mitochondrial mass. Further studies demonstrated significant drug-dependent decreases in the expression of nuclear encoded complex II, mitochondria-encoded complex IV, plus a decrease in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The studies have demonstrated that the HepaRG cell model is a suitable model for the study of mitochondrial toxicity induced by nucleoside antivirals with evidence indicating that the mechanism of action via effects upon mitochondrial DNA matches the clinical mechanism of hepatotoxicity. Further studies utilising HepaRG were performed to assess the chemical and molecular pathways of toxicity induced by paracetamol. The studies provided evidence that HepaRG cells have the metabolic capacity for the turnover of parent compound to the toxic metabolite NAPQI. Furthermore, acute metabolic screening demonstrated that following short term incubations the parent compound paracetamol contains a mitochondrial liability in the absence of NAPQI-induced GSH depletion. The studies within this thesis have highlighted that the HepaRG line is suitable for the detection of mitotoxicants in which toxicity is delayed or which is mediated via CYP P 450 catalysed-metabolites. Additionally, the studies provide much evidence as to the power of in vitro screening models in providing fine and detailed mechanistic information...|$|E
40|$|A subtle {{mutation}} that rendered type I collagen {{resistant to}} mammalian collagenase {{has been introduced}} into the murine Col 1 a- 1 (recently redesignated Cola- 1) gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Initially, a "hit and run" procedure was used. Since two steps were required for introducing each mutation {{and more than one}} mutation was to be introduced in the same genomic region independently, we have developed a streamlined procedure that involves two sequential replacement-type homologous recombination events. In the first step, an internal deletion was introduced into the Col 1 a- 1 locus along with the positive and negative selectable markers, neo and tk, to mark the region of interest. G 418 -resistant homologous recombinants were isolated and used in the second step in which the deleted Col 1 a- 1 allele was replaced with a construct containing the desired mutation. Homologous recombinants containing the mutation were identified among the Tk- ES clones after selection with FIAU [1 -(2 -deoxy- 2 -fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl) - 5 -iodouracil (called <b>fialuridine)</b> ]. Approximately 10 % of such clones contained the desired mutation. The double replacement procedure greatly reduces the time and amount of work required to introduce mutations independently into the same or closely linked regions. Once the homologous recombinants derived from the first step are established, the introduction of other mutations into the deleted region becomes a one-step procedure. For X number of introduced mutations, 2 X selections are required with the "hit and run" approach, but only X + 1 are required with the double-replacement method. This innovative procedure could be very useful in studies of gene structure and function as well as gene expression and regulation...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} reported {{that both the}} concentrative (hCNT) and equilibrative (hENT) nucleoside transporters are expressed in the human liver (21). Here we report a study that investigated the expression of these transporters (transcripts and proteins) and {{their role in the}} hepatobiliary transport of nucleosides/nucleoside drugs using sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes. In the hepatic tissue, the rank order of the mRNA expression of the transporters was hCNT 1 ≈ hENT 1 > hENT 2 ≈ hCNT 2 > hCNT 3. In sandwich-cultured hepatocytes, the mRNA expression of hCNT 2 and hENT 2 was comparable to that in hepatic tissue, whereas the expression of corresponding transporters in the two-dimensional hepatocyte cultures was lower. Colocalization studies demonstrated predominant localization of these transporters at the sinusoidal membrane and of hENT 1, hCNT 1, and hCNT 2 at the canalicular membrane. In the sandwich-cultured hepatocytes, ENTs were the major contributors to the transport of thymidine (hENT 1, 63 %; hENT 2, 23 %) or guanosine (hENT 1, 53 %; hENT 2, 24 %) into the hepatocytes followed by hCNT 1 (10 %) for thymidine or hCNT 2 (23 %) for guanosine. Although ribavirin was predominately transported (89 %) into the hepatocytes by hENT 1, <b>fialuridine</b> (FIAU) was transported by both hENT 1 (30 %) and hCNTs (61 %). The extensively metabolized natural nucleosides were not effluxed into the bile, whereas significant biliary-efflux was observed of FIAU (19 %), ribavirin (30 %), and formycin B (35 %). We conclude that the hepatic activity of hENT 1 and hCNT 1 / 2 transporters will determine the in vivo hepatic distribution and therefore the efficacy and/or toxicity of nucleoside drugs used to treat hepatic diseases...|$|E
40|$|Hepadnaviruses {{employ a}} unique {{mechanism}} for the initiation of RNA-directed DNA synthesis. Initially, four bases (5 '-GTAA- 3 ') are added to a tyrosine residue of the viral polymerase by reverse transcription of a bulge sequence in epsilon, a stem-loop structure which functions as the packaging signal for pregenomic RNA. This protein-DNA complex acts as the primer for minus-strand elongation from the 3 ' sequence, DR 1. To understand this process in greater detail, we investigated whether the protein-mediated priming of viral DNA synthesis is affected by nucleotide analogs. By using cell-free expression of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) reverse transcriptase (G. -H. Wang and C. Seeger, Cell 71 : 663 - 670, 1992), the 5 '-triphosphate of the thymidine analog <b>fialuridine</b> (FIAU) was shown to inhibit the incorporation of radiolabeled TMP into primer DNA in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition by the 5 '-triphosphate of FIAU (FIAU-TP) was nearly complete at a concentration of 10 microM. The dideoxynucleotide analogs ddGTP, ddTTP, and 3 '-azidodeoxythymidine triphosphate, known inhibitors of DHBV endogenous DNA polymerase, did not affect substantially the synthesis of primer DNA. Alternate substrate analysis suggested that FIAU is incorporated efficiently into nascent primer DNA as an analog of thymidine. Using site-directed mutagenesis to construct a mutant RNA template yielding a primer with the sequence 5 '-GTAC- 3 ', we demonstrated that FIAU-TP inhibited the incorporation of TMP, {{had no effect on}} that of dAMP, and decreased markedly the incorporation of dCMP. These results show that the synthesis of full-length DHBV primer DNA is inhibited by FIAU-TP but not by the dideoxynucleotide analogs that we tested. The significance of these findings as they relate to HBV DNA replication is discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fialuridine</b> (FIAU) is a {{nucleoside}} analog with potent activity against hepatitis B virus in vitro and in vivo. In this report, {{the effect of}} FIAU on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication in vitro was investigated. CEM cells, a cell line derived from human T cells, were incubated for 6 days in up to 20 microM FIAU. Total cellular DNA was isolated, normalized {{for the number of}} cells, and slot hybridized to a probe specific for mtDNA sequences. Treatment of CEM cells with FIAU did not result in a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of mtDNA. In contrast, dideoxycytidine (ddC) inhibited mtDNA replication by 50 % at a concentration of approximately 0. 1 microM. After 6 days of incubation, both compounds displayed a 50 % toxic dose at a concentration of approximately 2 microM in CEM cells and approximately 34 microM in human hepatoblastoma cells (HepG 2). In further experiments, CEM cells were incubated for 15 days in up to 2. 5 microM FIAU, and again, no inhibition of mtDNA was observed. Over a 6 -day incubation, FIAU, at concentrations of up to 200 microM, also failed to inhibit mtDNA replication in either HepG 2 or HepG 2 cells which constitutively replicate duck hepatitis B virus. In contrast, ddC inhibited mtDNA replication in these cells with a 50 % inhibitory concentration of approximately 0. 2 microM over a 6 -day incubation. Treatment of cells with either FIAU or ddC resulted in a dose-dependent increase in lactate levels in the cell medium, indicating that any effect of FIAU on mitochondrial function may not be related to inhibition of mtDNA replication {{on the basis of the}} in vitro data. Alternative explanations for mitochondrial toxicity are considered...|$|E
40|$|Seven of 15 {{clinical}} trial participants {{treated with a}} nucleoside analogue (<b>fialuridine</b> [FIAU]) developed acute liver failure. Five treated participants died, and two required a liver transplant. Preclinical toxicology studies in mice, rats, dogs, and primates did not provide any indication that FIAU would be hepatotoxic in humans. Therefore, we investigated whether FIAU-induced liver toxicity could be detected in chimeric TK-NOG mice with humanized livers. Control and chimeric TK-NOG mice with humanized livers were treated orally with FIAU 400, 100, 25, or 2. 5 mg/kg/d. The response to drug treatment was evaluated by measuring plasma lactate and liver enzymes, by assessing liver histology, and by electron microscopy. After treatment with FIAU 400 mg/kg/d for 4 d, chimeric mice developed clinical and serologic evidence of liver failure and lactic acidosis. Analysis of liver tissue revealed steatosis in regions with human, but not mouse, hepatocytes. Electron micrographs revealed lipid and mitochondrial abnormalities in the human hepatocytes in FIAU-treated chimeric mice. Dose-dependent liver toxicity was detected in chimeric mice treated with FIAU 100, 25, or 2. 5 mg/kg/d for 14 d. Liver toxicity did not develop in control mice that were treated with the same FIAU doses for 14 d. In contrast, treatment with another nucleotide analogue (sofosbuvir 440 or 44 mg/kg/d po) for 14 d, which did not cause liver toxicity in human trial participants, did not cause liver toxicity in mice with humanized livers. FIAU-induced liver toxicity could be readily detected using chimeric TK-NOG mice with humanized livers, even when the mice were treated with a FIAU dose that was only 10 -fold above the dose used in human participants. The clinical features, laboratory abnormalities, liver histology, and ultra-structural changes observed in FIAU-treated chimeric mice mirrored those of FIAU-treated human participants. The use of chimeric mice in preclinical toxicology studies could improve the safety of candidate medications selected for testing in human participants.

40|$|Varicella zoster virus (VZV), {{a member}} of the {{herpesvirus}} family, is responsible for both primary (varicella, chickenpox) as well as reactivation (zoster, shingles) infections. In immunocompetent patients, the course of varicella is generally benign. For varicella zoster, post-herpetic neuralgia is the most common complication. In immunocompromised patients (particularly those with AIDS), transplant recipients and cancer patients, VZV infections can be life-threatening. For these patients and also for immunocompetent patients at risk such as pregnant women or premature infants, the current treatment of choice is based on either intravenous or oral aciclovir (acyclovir). The low oral bioavailability of aciclovir, as well as the emergence of drug-resistant virus strains, have stimulated efforts towards the development of new compounds for the treatment of individuals with VZV infections. Among these new compounds, penciclovir, its oral prodrug form famciclovir and the oral pro-drug form of aciclovir (valaciclovir), rank among the most promising. As with aciclovir itself, all of these drugs are dependent on the virus-encoded thymidine kinase (TK) for their intracellular activation (phosphorylation), and, upon conversion to their triphosphate form, they act as inhibitors/alternative substrate of the viral DNA polymerase. Therefore, cross-resistance to these drugs may be expected for those virus mutants that are TK-deficient and thus resistant to aciclovir. Other classes of nucleoside analogues dependent for their phosphorylation on the viral TK that have been pursued for the treatment of VZV infections include sorivudine, brivudine, <b>fialuridine,</b> fiacitabine and netivudine. Among oxetanocins, which are partially dependent on viral TK, lobucavir is now under clinical evaluation. Foscarnet, which does not require any previous metabolism to interact with the viral DNA polymerase, is used in the clinic when TK-deficient VZV mutants emerge during aciclovir treatment. TK-deficient mutants are also sensitive to the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (i. e. [s]- 1 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl]cytosine; HPMPC); these agents do not depend on the virus-encoded TK for their phosphorylation but depend on cellular enzymes for conversion to their diphosphoryl derivatives which then inhibit viral DNA synthesis. Vaccination for VZV has now come of age. It is recommended for healthy children, patients with leukaemia, and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or those with chronic diseases. The protection induced by the vaccine seems, to some extent, to include zoster and associated neuralgia. Passive immuniatin based on specific immunoglobulins does not effectively prevent VZV infection and is therefore restricted to high risk individuals (i. e. immunocompromised children and pregnant women). status: publishe...|$|E
