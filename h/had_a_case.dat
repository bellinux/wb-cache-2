500|$|Professor Lamine (KUL), {{a former}} Vlaams Blok member and [...] "advisor" [...] of the party's legal team, {{claimed that the}} party, for {{propaganda}} reasons, purposely undertook a weak defence, in order to lose the case; [...] "For the party leaders, losing was much more interesting. Winning just wasn't an option." [...] Lamine himself had earlier stated that the party should have carried the trial to the European Court of Human Rights, but Vlaams Blok senator Joris Van Hauthem had already stated in 2005, that; [...] "If we had gone to Strasbourg [...] based on procedural arguments, we might have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>case.</b> But Lamine already put in a private claim to overturn the Appeals Court verdict, {{on the basis of}} substantive arguments. If Vlaams Belang were to put forth a claim against the verdict as well, at Strasbourg, the Court will bundle both cases. Then we would lose the case for sure. Lamine has thus given us the final blow." ...|$|E

I {{examined}} the spine and found a displaced vertebra pressing against the nerves which innervate the heart. I adjusted the vertebra and gave immediate relief– nothing [...] "accidental" [...] or [...] "crude" [...] about this. Then I began to reason if two diseases, so dissimilar as deafness and heart trouble, came from impingement, a pressure on nerves, were not other disease due to a similar cause? Thus the science (knowledge) and art (adjusting) of Chiropractic were formed at that time." ...|$|E

2500|$|FMD occurs {{throughout}} much of the world, and while some countries have been free of FMD for some time, its wide host range and rapid spread represent cause for international concern. After World War II, the disease was widely distributed throughout the world. In 1996, endemic areas included Asia, Africa, and parts of South America; as of August 2007, Chile is disease-free, and Uruguay and Argentina have not had an outbreak since 2001. In May 2014, the FAO informed that Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru were [...] "just one step away" [...] from eradication; North America and Australia have been free of FMD for many years. New Zealand has never <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of foot-and-mouth disease.

After determining that the reading was correct, the nurse believed Joan was in shock and placed a call to Dr. Walter Bertinot, who was named as his wife's attending physician by John Hill. [...] Bertinot, who knew Joan only socially, had no reason to believe she was seriously ill until the call from the hospital nurse. [...] Hill had described his wife's symptoms as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; Bertinot initially thought she was suffering from influenza. When Bertinot arrived in Joan's hospital room, she recognized him and made reference to a party which they had both attended.

2500|$|Umaga was {{involved}} in an incident in the first Test of the Lions tour to New Zealand on 25 June 2005 that caused friction between the Lions and All Blacks. Early in the Test, Umaga and hooker Keven Mealamu upended Lions captain Brian O'Driscoll in a post-ruck clean-out. O'Driscoll required surgery on a dislocated shoulder and missed {{the rest of the}} tour. The British and Irish media accused Umaga of foul play. O'Driscoll and Lions management characterised the incident as a [...] "deliberate spear tackle". The independent citing commissioner found that neither Umaga nor Mealamu <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> to answer at the time due to inconclusive evidence, but after viewing new amateur footage of the incident, Greg Thomas, communications manager for the sport's governing body, the International Rugby Board (IRB), described the tackle as [...] "unacceptably dangerous" [...] and stated that IRB was instructing referees to suspend players for three to six months for such offences. Daily Telegraph London journalist Brendan Gallagher labelled it as one of the fifty 'ugliest moments' in sports.|$|E
