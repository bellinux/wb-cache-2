25|$|PMMA transmits up to 92% {{of visible}} light (3mm thickness), {{and gives a}} {{reflection}} of about 4% from each of its surfaces due to its refractive index (1.4905 at 589.3nm). It filters ultraviolet (UV) light at wavelengths below about 300 nm (similar to ordinary window glass). Some manufacturers add coatings or additives to PMMA to improve absorption in the 300–400nm range. PMMA passes infrared light of up to 2,800nm and blocks IR of longer wavelengths up to 25,000nm. Colored PMMA varieties allow specific IR wavelengths to pass while blocking visible light (for remote control or <b>heat</b> <b>sensor</b> applications, for example).|$|E

50|$|A second {{method of}} {{measuring}} heat flux is {{by using a}} <b>heat</b> flux <b>sensor,</b> or <b>heat</b> flux transducer, to directly measure the amount of heat being transferred to/from the surface that the <b>heat</b> flux <b>sensor</b> is mounted to. The {{most common type of}} <b>heat</b> flux <b>sensor</b> is a differential temperature thermopile which operates on essentially the same principal as the first measurement method that was mentioned except it has the advantage in that the thermal resistance/conductivity {{does not need to be}} a known parameter. These parameters do not have to be known since the <b>heat</b> flux <b>sensor</b> enables an in-situ measurement of the existing heat flux by using the Seebeck-Effect. However, differential thermopile <b>heat</b> flux <b>sensors</b> have to be calibrated in order to relate their output signals μV to heat flux values W/(m2⋅K). Once the <b>heat</b> flux <b>sensor</b> is calibrated it can then be used to directly measure heat flux without requiring the rarely known value of thermal resistance or thermal conductivity.|$|R

50|$|Normally, the {{lifetime}} of an unheated sensor is about 30,000 to 50,000 miles (50,000 to 80,000 km). <b>Heated</b> <b>sensor</b> lifetime is typically 100,000 miles (160,000 km). Failure of an unheated sensor is usually caused by the buildup of soot on the ceramic element, which lengthens its response time and may cause total loss of ability to sense oxygen. For <b>heated</b> <b>sensors,</b> normal deposits are burned off during operation and failure occurs due to catalyst depletion. The probe then tends to report lean mixture, the ECU enriches the mixture, the exhaust gets rich with carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, and the fuel economy worsens.|$|R

5000|$|... 1/11/2002: The campus fire {{department}} {{responded to a}} <b>heat</b> <b>sensor</b> activation at the Sinsheimer Labs around 5:30am. Upon arrival, crews noticed smoke and flame coming from a lab on the 4th floor in the south wing. [...] A report was put it for mutual aid from neighboring departments, including the County Haz-Mat team. The fire destroyed the lab in which it originated in, and most of a neighboring lab. Reconstruction {{had to be done}} on that portion of the building. Because there were no fire sprinklers in the building at the time (only a fire detection system), a high demand for the building to be retrofitted with sprinklers lead to the installation of them in months following the fire. There was no cause determined, but it was speculated that a small piece of equipment may have overheated causing the fire. No injuries were reported.|$|E
50|$|Phase one mode is {{activated}} by a corresponding smoke sensor or <b>heat</b> <b>sensor</b> in the building. Once an alarm has been activated, the elevator will automatically go into phase one.

However, if the alarm was activated on the fire-recall floor, the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to. When the elevator is recalled, it proceeds to the recall floor and stops with its doors open. The elevator will no longer respond to calls or move in any direction. Located on the fire-recall floor is a fire-service key switch. The fire-service key switch has the ability to turn fire service off, turn fire service on or to bypass fire service. The only way to return the elevator to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the alarms have reset.|$|E

40|$|To {{monitor the}} high-intensity heat flux {{conditions}} {{that occur in}} the space shuttle main engine (SSME), it is necessary to use specifically designed <b>heat</b> flux <b>sensors.</b> These sensors, which are of the Gardon-type, are exposed on the measuring face to high-intensity radiative and convective heat fluxes and on the other face to convective cooling. To improve the calibration and measurement accuracy of these gauges, researchers are studing the effect that the thermal boundary conditions have on gauge performance. In particular, they are studying how convective cooling effects the field inside the sensor and the measured heat flux. The first phase of this study involves a numerical study of these effects. Subsequent phases will involve experimental verification. A computer model of the heat transfer around a Garden-type <b>heat</b> flux <b>sensor</b> was developed. Two specific geometries are being considered are: (1) <b>heat</b> flux <b>sensor</b> mounted on a flat-plate; and (2) <b>heat</b> flux <b>sensor</b> mounted at the stagnation point of a circular cylinder.

5000|$|The Shriekers' {{most notable}} feature is their <b>heat</b> <b>sensor,</b> a brain-like {{pulsating}} organ atop their head {{which is usually}} covered by a frill-like flap of skin, which {{is supported by a}} small ridge {{at the base of the}} skull. Using this sensor, Shriekers sense infrared heat, which is their only sense other than taste and touch as they lack eyes, ears or a nose. As shown by shots in Tremors 2 depicting the creatures' point of view, the heat sensed by the Shriekers is apparently processed into an image highly similar to that of an infrared camera. Another thing unexplained in the films is the Shriekers' ability to [...] "see" [...] heat before raising the frill covering their heat sensor; they always seem to know when to raise it. It is explained on the Stampede Entertainment FAQ that they can see some heat through the frills. Raising them merely enables them to make full use of the obviously delicate sensory organ, similar to opening one's eyes widely. Individual Shriekers are much easier to kill than Graboids, being smaller, surface-dwelling and more easily damaged by firearms; but conversely, they hunt in groups and rely on swarm tactics. Like Graboids, Shriekers have malodorous orange blood.|$|E
5000|$|More typical systems {{incorporate}} a digital cellular communication unit that will contact the central station (or some other location) via the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) {{and raise the}} alarm, either with a synthesized voice or increasingly via an encoded message string that the central station decodes. These may connect to the regular phone system on the system side of the demarcation point, but typically connect on the customer side ahead of all phones within the monitored premises so that the alarm system can seize the line by cutting-off any active calls and call the monitoring company if needed. A dual signalling system would raise the alarm wirelessly via a radio path (GPRS/GSM) or cellular path using the phone line or broadband line as a back-up overcoming any compromise to the phone line. Encoders can be programmed to indicate which specific sensor was triggered, and monitors can show the physical location (or [...] "zone") of the sensor on a list or even {{a map of the}} protected premises, which can make the resulting response more effective. For example, a <b>heat</b> <b>sensor</b> alarm, coupled with a flame detector in the same area is a more reliable indication of an actual fire than just one or the other sensor indication by itself.|$|E
