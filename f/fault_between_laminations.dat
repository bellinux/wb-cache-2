40|$|Interlaminar <b>faults</b> <b>between</b> <b>laminations</b> of the {{magnetic}} cores increase core losses and could cause major damage to electrical machines. A system has been developed to detect an interlaminar <b>fault</b> <b>between</b> the <b>laminations</b> of {{the magnetic}} cores {{by means of the}} flux injection probe (FIP). Experimental work was carried out to calibrate the measuring system and qualify its accuracy over a wide measurement range. Application of a prototype FIP to quality assessment of transformer laminations was investigated in two stages: 1) inspection of stack of laminations with known interlaminar faults applied by artificial shorts and 2) inspection of stack of laminations with unknown quality. The experimental results show that the developed system is capable of detecting an interlaminar <b>fault</b> <b>between</b> as few as two laminations...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} {{the influence of the}} inter-laminar short circuit faults on the performance of magnetic cores and develop a non-destructive method to detect these kinds of defects. The eddy current path in magnetic laminations which is magnetised by time varying magnetic field was modelled by an equivalent resistor network to calculate and predict the eddy current power losses in magnetic laminations. The model was validated over a wide range of magnetisation conditions. Based on the developed model, the influence {{of a wide range of}} magnetising frequency and peak flux density on the magnetic properties of electrical steels was studied. An experimental-analytical technique was developed to separate magnetic loss components over a wide range of magnetisation. Two electrical steel laminations, Conventional Grain Oriented (CGO) and Non-Oriented (NO), were used in the experimental work of the relevant studies. 2 -D FE based modelling was performed to simulate inter-laminar faults on stacks of laminations and visualise the distribution of eddy currents in the faulted laminations. The influence of inter-laminar faults on the eddy current power loss was experimentally investigated by introducing artificial short circuits of different configurations on stacks of Epstein size laminations of GO steel. A non-destructive test method was developed to detect inter-laminar <b>fault</b> <b>between</b> the <b>laminations</b> of the magnetic cores by means of Flux Injection Probe (FIP). A prototype model of a FIP was developed and its application to quality assessment of transformer core laminations was investigated. The research presented here can be utilised by electrical steel manufacturers and electrical machine designers to survey the effect of inter-laminar faults on the magnetic properties of magnetic cores and their quality assessment, to reduce the risk of core damage or machine failure caused by the inter-laminar faults...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{composite}} structures based on _bre angle optimisation rapidly becomes intractable {{as the number}} of design variables increases. Lamination parameters can be used instead as intermediate design variables in order to overcome this issue. An extra step is then required in order to convert the optimal design expressed in lamination param- eter into feasible blended stacking sequences. However, disparities <b>between</b> the <b>lamination</b> parameter and stacking sequence designs performance are generally observed due to dis- crepancies between both design spaces. In this paper, the lamination parameter blending constraints recently proposed by the authors are applied to the aeroelastic optimisation of the common research wing model in order to diminish these discrepancies and achieve more realistic lamination parameter designs. A comparison between the optimised designs achieved with and without the proposed blending constraints is carried out to evaluate our approach. Results demonstrate that the application of blending constraints greatly in- creases the matching quality <b>between</b> <b>lamination</b> parameter and stacking sequence designs, consequently facilitating the retrieval of equivalent blended stacking sequences.

50|$|Electrical {{steel is}} usually coated to {{increase}} electrical resistance <b>between</b> <b>laminations,</b> reducing eddy currents, to provide {{resistance to corrosion}} or rust, and {{to act as a}} lubricant during die cutting. There are various coatings, organic and inorganic, and the coating used depends on the application of the steel. The type of coating selected depends on the heat treatment of the laminations, whether the finished lamination will be immersed in oil, and the working temperature of the finished apparatus. Very early practice was to insulate each lamination with a layer of paper or a varnish coating, but this reduced the stacking factor of the core and limited the maximum temperature of the core.|$|R

50|$|Eddy {{currents}} generate {{resistive losses}} that transform {{some forms of}} energy, such as kinetic energy, into heat. This Joule heating reduces efficiency of iron-core transformers and electric motors and other devices that use changing magnetic fields. Eddy currents are minimized in these devices by selecting magnetic core materials that have low electrical conductivity (e.g., ferrites) or by using thin sheets of magnetic material, known as laminations. Electrons cannot cross the insulating gap <b>between</b> the <b>laminations</b> and so are unable to circulate on wide arcs. Charges gather at the lamination boundaries, in a process analogous to the Hall effect, producing electric fields that oppose any further accumulation of charge and hence suppressing the eddy currents. The shorter the distance <b>between</b> adjacent <b>laminations</b> (i.e., the greater the number of laminations per unit area, perpendicular to the applied field), the greater the suppression of eddy currents.|$|R
