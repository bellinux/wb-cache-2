40|$|Many {{professionals}} in Higher Education execute a combined function of research, {{education and social}} services. Many times, science communication is considered as an additional task that is left behind by many. In this talk, I will present how Science communication should and could be a concern of all {{professionals in}} Higher Education. Importantly however, the involvement rate might change depending on the availability and busy timing schedule of the complex functions in Higher Education. Therefore, I suggest a solution in which professionals can vary from a very little time consuming involvement such as feeding the central research services with informative for social media and websites, towards designing attracting gadgets luring to scientific websites onto the concrete engagement in giving workshops and lectures {{for the general public}} and even start up small or bigger project specifically on science communication. For the latter, the possibility of enabling students, e. g. by means of community service learning projects, might serve as a lever for higher impact. Indeed, in any of these small to big engagement onto science communication, one can try to estimate the impact of his or her efforts by balancing effort (<b>how</b> <b>many</b> minutes, hours, days,…?) over reach (<b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> <b>does</b> it change e. g. attitude towards science and/or STEM?). the real impact of these initiatives is a promising avenue for future research on science communication. Anyway, motivating professionals in Higher Education by presenting the possibilities to execute science communication from mouse to elephant has been successful in our Flemish University College Odisee, an organization with more than 10. 000 students and over 1. 150 professionals in Higher Education.

Shared language refers to people developing understanding amongst themselves based on language (e. g. spoken, text) to help them communicate more effectively.

40|$|For {{most of us}} a {{walk through}} the Duke Forest is more than fresh air and tall trees. It is an escape from manmade {{surroundings}} to Mother Nature's paradise. Walking along a barely distinguishable trail, taking refreshment in {{what appears to be}} the virginal out-of-doors, one imagines undisturbed generations of wildlife touched only by the changing seasons. If, by mistake or romantic inclination, the nature-lover leaves the trail and discovers the vacated furrows or abandoned farm houses, the surrounding forest, once perceived as pure and unchanged, takes on a new identity. Here are retired farmlands where fields and pastures have, over the decades and generations, grown into woodlots and meadows. Who farmed this land and for how long? What crops and livestock did the farmer cultivate and raise? What sorts of agricultural techniques and implements did he employ? Whom, and <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> the land support? What were the consequences for the land when generations of farmers stripped the forest and tilled the soil? These are but a few of the questions a detailed study of the land-use practices of the Couch Tract of the Durham Division of the Duke Forest answers. Finally, why was this land, after spending two hundred years in the same family, permanently retired and eventually sold to Duke University in 1947 ? Such a study relies extensively on primary sources, such as estate papers, wills, personal letters, family papers, land deeds, and population, agricultural and slave census schedules. In addition, this kind of land-use analysis utilizes soil surveys, aerial photographs and forest cover maps. Tax lists, legal papers and oral histories are other important resource tools for land-use research and analysis. This thesis is a case study of the history of a family of small farmers and their attempts, over five generations, to get a living from their land. This thesis examines the 4 possibilities and the limits of certain agricultural practices and the intelligent yet doomed approach to landuse the Couchs chose. This study does not just seek to find out about a family and its farm. Rather, it attempts to discover the different stages of change and the reasons for those changes. For instance; when did the farm begin producing for the market and why, why were some crops cultivated early in the history of the farm and others later? Most historical studies of agricultural practices in the South focus on the southern plantation. Historians such as William C. Bagley, Philip A. Courtney, Susan Dabney Smedes, and Julius Rubin have studied the failure of the southern plantation and have provided us with rich and detailed information on the southern planter. Although plantations produced the bulk of the staple crops of the South, small farmers made up the majority of rural Southerners. The study of the historical significance of the small southern farm and its agricultural practices [...] how it adapted to change and its eventual collapse [...] has just begun.

The {{aim of this}} study was to find how many young people detained in a Young Offenders' Institution (YOI) have had contact with another's suicide attempt and to test for association between this and own self-harming behaviour. A questionnaire, developed for the project, was distributed within a YOI. 74 % (355 / 480) responded. One hundred and fifty-one (43 %) of the young men reported that they knew someone who had attempted suicide, 48 of them knowing someone who had thereby died. The contact with a non-fatal suicide attempted by others was associated with own self-harm (OR 1. 73, CI 1. 39 - 21. 4, p< 0. 01); contact with completed suicide had no such association. The most important factor that increased the chance of knowing a suicide attempter was actual length of time spent in prison up to the time of the study; 95 (63 %) of the young men with such contact had it in prison. No other significant vulnerability factors were identified. It seems likely that imprisonment is a specific vulnerability factor for self-harm, one explanation being that it increases the risk of exposure to a contact with suicidal behaviour by others. Further work is called for to test relationships between such exposure and own behaviour over time, and to gather first hand accounts from the young men in such circumstances in order to understand the meaning for them of the contact with suicidal behaviour by others. This would inform appropriate intervention strategies, and could save much morbidity, and even mortality...|$|E

After asking such questions to school aged children, I realized many of their answers were masked with prejudice, ignorance, and fear. Upon further analysis of those questions, I knew I needed to create an educational source for such children who are both asking questions about diseases and who are living with diseases that are frequently misunderstood. Just a Kid: Emily’s Diabetes Story was inspired by two personal experiences in my life with diabetes. First, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent or juvenile diabetes) two years ago while studying abroad in Europe. Almost one year to the day later, my three year old niece was also diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. My niece’s experience in pre-school further illuminated fearful and ignorant responses to questions concerning her diabetes. I knew writing a non-fiction children’s picture book on type 1 diabetes was a perfect solution for all children in the classroom. My hopes for this book is to help educate parents, guardians, teachers, and students about type 1 diabetes. In every school, there is a child living with this disease; it is imperative for all school members to understand how this child with diabetes functions from day to day.

40|$|What is a {{multiword}} expression (MWE) and <b>how</b> <b>many</b> are there? What is a MWE? What is many? Mark Liberman gave a great invited talk at ACL- 89 titled “how <b>many</b> words <b>do</b> <b>people</b> know? ” {{where he}} spent the entire hour questioning the question. Many of these same questions apply to multiword expressions. What is a word? What is many? What is a person? What {{does it mean to}} know? Rather than answer these questions, this paper will use these questions as Liberman did, as an excuse for surveying how such issues are addressed in a variety of fields: computer science, web search, linguistics, lexicography, educational testing, psychology, statistics, etc. 1 <b>How</b> <b>many</b> words <b>do</b> <b>people</b> know? One can find all sorts of answers on the web: • Very low: Apparently I only knew 7, 000 words when I was seven and 14, 000 when I was fourteen. I learned from exposure. Now things are not that easy in a second language, but it just shows that the brain can absorb information from sheer input. ...|$|R
2500|$|Similar {{judgments}} {{were issued}} from various {{sides of the}} cultural spectrum. Although himself a collaborator of Perpessicius, Vladimir Streinu once referred to him as [...] "the flower girl of our literature". While Tudor Vianu believed the [...] "discreet" [...] Perpessicius able of [...] "biting irony", he also claimed: [...] "The critic is at times too indulgent and, as a consequence, the contrasts in his appreciations are somewhat toned down. But <b>how</b> <b>many</b> young <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not absorb fortifying strengths from Perpessicius' benevolent verdicts?" [...] Perpessicius' rejection of [...] "sectarianism" [...] was unfavorably reviewed by Cioculescu in a 1928 article for Adevărul, which prompted a reply from Perpessicius. For Alexandru Al, Philippide, the second volume of Antologia poeţilor de azi was a sample of such leniency, {{to the point of}} becoming [...] "embarrassingly instructive" [...] by including talentless authors. He noted: [...] "Seventy real poets in {{a quarter of a century}} is an a priori impossibility. [...] In such conditions, poetry presents itself as a real scourge, like some dangerous pestilence, almost like a social peril. And in such circumstances an anthology as horrifyingly complete as that of Mr. Pillat and Mr. Perpessicius appears to be disastrous. It is made to implant the belief that poets are to be found in a sum of individuals who, perhaps, had they been lacking such 'consecration', would be growing disillusioned and turn back into decent men, brave citizens and diligent clerks". The dispute touched on Perpessicius' own relationship with the avant-garde. In his account of Voronca's departure from the Surrealist group (part of a 1933 letter addressed to Fondane), Roll sarcastically downplayed his former colleague's success, alleging: [...] "Only Perpessicius smothered [...] in slobbery, grandmotherly, kisses; only Perpessicius showered with gifts, produced licks of the tongue, telephone calls and accolades." ...|$|R
40|$|Before today, when I {{read the}} {{acknowledgements}} of theses from previous years, I was always shocked. In fact, I think the acknowledgements were {{the part of}} other people’s theses that stressed me out the most (which is saying a lot). Will I really need that <b>many</b> <b>people’s</b> help? I don’t think it was until this very moment, when I realized <b>how</b> very <b>many</b> <b>people</b> I <b>do</b> have to thank, that I realize how much help I really did need, and am so appreciative {{to all those who}} provided it. So, here goes… First, I want to thank Juj, Hel, Sons, Calvo, the CozyTown anthem, and the memory of Herb, for making the past year one of the best (or the best?) year(s) of my life. I don’t think I’ll ever be cozier. To the dinners and laughs and stupid outfits that made this year fly by. And thank you to Tess and Erica for five hour Usdan dinners, for editing drafts, and for sharing gum, wine, runs, clothes, and philosophical insights. And thank you to Alex, for having unlimited confidence in me and in my ability to do almost anything, which helps me to do at least something. And thank you to my mom for always encouraging me to (or just giving me the gene...|$|R
