40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to examine}} the effects of several factors such as {{demographics}} (i. e., gender, age, education and marital status), investment decision criteria (i. e., risk, repay, corporate data and society criteria), and financial literacy level (i. e., basic and advanced literacy) on more preferred investment alternatives in Turkey (e. g., foreign currency, bank <b>deposit,</b> <b>bond,</b> stock and mutual fund).

40|$|Description of Transaction/Event 1. Entities {{undertaking}} {{property development}} projects, for example high-density residential towers, industrial estates and commercial and office space, are usually involved in long-term projects. In {{the case of}} residential developments, sales of individual apartments are commonly made “off the plan”, that is, purchasers legally commit to acquire the completed apartment upon construction completion. Similar arrangements may also occur in respect of other property developments, including the development of land for sale as serviced lots. Off-the-plan sales usually involve payment of a deposit which is only refundable if the developer does not complete the property within the contracted timeframes and specifications or otherwise breaches the contract or any representation or statutory obligation. Alternatively, the purchaser may provide the developer with a <b>deposit</b> <b>bond.</b> The balance {{of the purchase price}} is paid at contractual settlement. Under these arrangements, a property may be sold under contract many months before the construction is completed or even before construction has commenced...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coating deposition on laser surface modified H 13 {{tool steel}} using atmospheric plasma spray (APS) technique. A Praxair Plasma Spray System with SG- 100 gun {{was used to}} deposit coating materials on laser-modified H 13 tool steel substrate surface. A bond coat layer material was NiCrAlY alloy while the top coat was yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with powder size distribution range of - 106 µm to + 45 µm. A 23 design of experiment (DOE) was used to <b>deposit</b> <b>bond</b> coat and top coat powders with three controlled factors of input current, powder feed rate and stand-off-distance. The design was optimised for minimum porosity and maximum hardness. The coating thickness and percentage of porosity were measured using IM 7000 inverted optical microscope. Hardness properties of top coating layer were measured by using MMT-X 7 Matsuzawa Hardness Tester Machine with vickers hardness scale. The microscopy findings indicated variations of coating thickness at different parameters settings. Samples at the highest current and powder feed rate and lowest stand-off distance settings produced a lower porosity percentage and higher hardness. A higher powder feed rate with the smallest stand-off-distance allowed melted powders to travel uniformly onto the substrate surface. These findings were significant to development of thermal barrier coatings on semi-solid forming die surface...|$|E

An assurance policy covers an event that definitely will happen, while the insurance policy covers an event that might occur.|$|R
