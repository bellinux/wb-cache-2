5|$|<b>Diamonds</b> exhibit fluorescence, that is, they emit {{light of}} various colors and intensities under long-wave {{ultraviolet}} light (365nm): Cape series stones (type Ia) usually fluoresce blue, and these stones may also phosphoresce yellow, a unique property among gemstones. Other possible long-wave fluorescence colors are green (usually in brown stones), yellow, mauve, or red (in type IIb <b>diamonds).</b> In natural <b>diamonds,</b> there is typically {{little if any}} response to short-wave ultraviolet, but {{the reverse is true}} of synthetic <b>diamonds.</b> Some natural type IIb <b>diamonds</b> phosphoresce blue after exposure to short-wave ultraviolet. In natural <b>diamonds,</b> fluorescence under X-rays is generally bluish-white, yellowish or greenish. Some <b>diamonds,</b> particularly Canadian <b>diamonds,</b> show no fluorescence.|$|E

Most other <b>diamonds</b> show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws, and defect planes in the crystal lattice, all of which affect their hardness. It is possible to treat regular <b>diamonds</b> under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce <b>diamonds</b> that are harder than the <b>diamonds</b> used in hardness gauges.|$|E

5|$|Type II <b>diamonds</b> {{have very}} few if any {{nitrogen}} impurities. Pure (type IIa) diamond can be colored pink, red, or brown owing to structural anomalies arising through plastic deformation during crystal growth; these <b>diamonds</b> are rare (1.8% of gem <b>diamonds),</b> but constitute {{a large percentage of}} Australian <b>diamonds.</b> Type IIb <b>diamonds,</b> which account for ~0.1% of gem <b>diamonds,</b> are usually a steely blue or gray due to boron atoms scattered within the crystal matrix. These <b>diamonds</b> are also semiconductors, unlike other diamond types (see Electrical properties). Most blue-gray <b>diamonds</b> coming from the Argyle mine of Australia are not of type IIb, but of Ia type. Those <b>diamonds</b> contain large concentrations of defects and impurities (especially hydrogen and nitrogen) and the origin of their color is yet uncertain. Type II <b>diamonds</b> weakly absorb in a different region of the infrared (the absorption is due to the diamond lattice rather than impurities), and transmit in the ultraviolet below 225nm, unlike type I <b>diamonds.</b> They also have differing fluorescence characteristics, but no discernible visible absorption spectrum.|$|E

5|$|Diamond {{hardness}} {{depends on}} its purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the <111> direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice).

5|$|<b>Diamonds</b> are {{naturally}} lipophilic and hydrophobic, {{which means the}} diamonds' surface cannot be wet by water, but can be easily wet and stuck by oil.

5|$|<b>Diamonds</b> {{prepared}} as gemstones are sold on diamond exchanges called bourses. There are 28 registered diamond bourses in the world.

40|$|Key words:diamond;saw blade; {{drilling}} bit;embedding strength Abstract. It is {{stated that}} <b>Diamond</b> saw blades requires high embedding {{strength of the}} <b>diamond,</b> while <b>diamond</b> drill bits do not. It is necessary to improve the embedding strength of <b>diamond</b> in <b>diamond</b> saw blades, {{rather than in the}} <b>diamond</b> drilling bits. It is recommended to count the number of <b>diamond</b> particles on the matrix surface and get the embedding strength of <b>diamond</b> by calculation. Another recommendation is to use the compound powder of cobalt and tungsten carbide for pelletizing in order to improve the embedding strength of <b>diamond</b> and lower the cost of matrix. There are people studying how to raise embedding strength of <b>diamond,</b> for both <b>diamond</b> saw blades and <b>diamond</b> drilling bit. However, the requirements for embedding strength of <b>diamond</b> saw blades and <b>diamond</b> drilling bit are different. The following parts include the analysis for this problem. Requirement of embedding strength for <b>diamond</b> drilling bit As shown in Figure 1, there are two counter forces on the surface <b>diamond</b> drill bit matrix. Force n is upwards, which won’t causes the <b>diamond</b> to fall off. The only possibility is Force t. Force t forms a very small torque, which can hardly pull the <b>diamond</b> down, especially in the presence of Force n.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report the}} {{systematic}} {{studies on the}} fabrication of aligned, uniform, and highly dense <b>diamond</b> nanostructures from <b>diamond</b> films of various granular structures. Self-assembled Au nanodots are used as a mask in the self-biased reactive-ion etching (RIE) process, using an O 2 /CF 4 process plasma. The morphology of <b>diamond</b> nanostructures is a close function of the initial phase composition of <b>diamond.</b> Cone-shaped and tip-shaped <b>diamond</b> nanostructures result for microcrystalline <b>diamond</b> (MCD) and nanocrystalline <b>diamond</b> (NCD) films, whereas pillarlike and grasslike <b>diamond</b> nanostructures are obtained for Ar-plasma-based and N 2 -plasma-based ultrananocrystalline <b>diamond</b> (UNCD) films, respectively. While the nitrogen-incorporated UNCD (N-UNCD) nanograss shows the most-superior electron-field-emission properties, the NCD nanotips exhibit the best photoluminescence properties, viz, different applications need different morphology of <b>diamond</b> nanostructures to optimize the respective characteristics. The optimum <b>diamond</b> nanostructure {{can be achieved by}} proper choice of granular structure of the initial <b>diamond</b> film. The etching mechanism is explained by in situ observation of optical emission spectrum of RIE plasma. The preferential etching of sp 2 -bonded carbon contained in the <b>diamond</b> films is the prime factor, which forms the unique <b>diamond</b> nanostructures from each type of <b>diamond</b> films.

40|$|Abstract. Although <b>diamond</b> tools {{have been}} used for over a century, the <b>diamond</b> grits {{distribution}} in the matrix is not uniform. This is because the large and light <b>diamond</b> grits tend to segregate from the small and heavy metal powder during the mixing process, hence <b>diamond</b> distribution in the <b>diamond</b> tools is intrinsically heterogeneous. As a result, the cutting performance of the <b>diamond</b> tools cannot be optimized. In 1997, Dr. James Chien-Min Sung applied two historical patents that can allow the design of <b>diamond</b> distribution according to a predetermined pattern. As the result, the life of <b>diamond</b> tools may be doubled; and the cutting speed, may also be twice as high. The three-dimensional saw segments with arrayed <b>diamond</b> grits were made back in 1999 with the improved performance as predicted. The Sung invention can allow the <b>diamond</b> tools industry to make ideal saw segment that has variable <b>diamond</b> size and <b>diamond</b> separation at different regions. Conventional <b>diamond</b> saws contain <b>diamond</b> grits that are distributed randomly in a metal matrix, as a result, their cutting speeds are slow and their sawing lives are short. In 1997, Dr. James C. Sung applied new patents that revealed revolutionary technology for making <b>diamond</b> tools with <b>diamond</b> grits set in a predetermined pattern. The <b>diamond</b> placement design was first appeared in a series of DiaGrid products, such as wire saws and grinding wheels. In 1999...|$|R
