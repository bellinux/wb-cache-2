40|$|Abstract. <b>Handling</b> <b>and</b> stabilities is {{important}} for steer by wire (SBW) system. Firstly, a platform for SBW <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> stabilities analysis and parameter optimization with friendly graphic user interface (GUI) {{is built based on}} Matlab GUI technology. Secondly, three degree of freedom <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> stabilities model with steering angle as input is built and system stability is analyzed based on Routh-Hurwitz stability and poles methods. Then simulations are carried out to show effects of some vehicle parameters on <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> stabilities. Finally, the <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> stabilities sensitive parameters are optimized using genetic algorithm method to improve step responses <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> stabilities...|$|R

The Valtra tractor business was sold to AGCO, a worldwide agricultural manufacturer.

5|$|As {{nuclear weapons}} {{development}} proceeded, the weapons became mass-produced, smaller, lighter, {{and easier to}} store, <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> maintain. They also required less effort to assemble. The AFSWP gradually shifted its emphasis away from training assembly teams, and became more involved in stockpile management and providing administrative, technical and logistical support. It supported nuclear weapons testing, although after Operation Sandstone in 1948, this was increasingly in a planning and training capacity rather than a field role. In 1958, the AFSWP became the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA), a field agency of the Department of Defense.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and <b>handle,</b> <b>and</b> made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E

The main entrance is composed of a tall double wooden entrance door, with its original <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> locks. Each door consists of four vertical wooden panels. A rectangular transom light of four vertical glass panels tops the main entryway's double wooden doors. Outside the entryway is a spacious brick stoop that is accessed by a cement walkway from West Main Street. Its brick steps {{leading up to the}} stoop were last restored in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|HMS Vigilant was a {{merchantman}} {{converted into}} a warship during the American Revolution. After serving as a transport in North American waters from 1775, she was purchased by the Royal Navy (RN) and modified for shore bombardment duties in 1777. She {{was instrumental in the}} eventual British success during the siege of Fort Mifflin that same year and supported British operations in Georgia and South Carolina in 1779–80. Her heavy armament proved to be more than Vigilant was designed to <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> she was condemned and disposed of in 1780.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc learnt a {{great deal}} about how to <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> supply a force {{advancing}} across the desert, and was rewarded with the British Distinguished Service Order. He began planning a far more ambitious advance into Libya. This was delayed by a year due to Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel's defeat of the British Eighth Army in the Battle of Gazala, and the subsequent German and Italian advance into Egypt. Leclerc was promoted to Général de brigade in August 1941, and pinned two metal stars captured from the Italians on his kepi.|$|E

5|$|The 15-inch turrets {{had been}} {{designed}} when the customary practice was to place the magazine above the shell room, {{and it was not}} cost-effective to modify the ammunition hoists to accommodate the opposite arrangement which was adopted after the Battle of Jutland demonstrated the dangers of exposing the magazines to long-range gunfire. The ship was provided with a powder-handling room above the shell room to mimic the arrangement that turret's hoists were designed to <b>handle,</b> <b>and</b> another set of hoists moved the propellant charges from the magazines to the powder-handling room. The charges were stowed in cases to reduce their exposure to fire.|$|E

5|$|The bat is a hitting tool, {{traditionally}} {{made of a}} single, solid {{piece of}} wood. Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games. It is a hard round stick, about 2.5inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower <b>handle</b> <b>and</b> culminating in a knob. Bats used by adults are typically around 34inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42inches (106 centimeters).|$|E

5|$|Among the {{innovations}} in business {{caused by the}} use of the nickel in coin-operated machines was the automat, in which patrons would serve themselves by inserting a coin (initially a nickel, though by the 1950s a higher denomination was needed) into a mechanism, turning a <b>handle,</b> <b>and</b> removing a sandwich or dessert. These restaurants were first established in Germany, but were popularized in the United States by, among other firms, Horn & Hardart. A type of business which took its name from the coin was the nickelodeon cinema, where a nickel bought admission to view a series of one-reel short films, generally about 12minutes in length, which ran continuously from early afternoon until late at night, with the patron free to remain as long as he liked. Although another denomination gave the penny arcade its name, the nickel was commonly used there as well.|$|E

He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
