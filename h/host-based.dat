2500|$|Recall {{the earlier}} {{discussion}} about administrative controls, logical controls, and physical controls. The {{three types of}} controls {{can be used to}} form the basis upon which to build a defense-in-depth strategy. With this approach, defense-in-depth can be conceptualized as three distinct layers or planes laid {{one on top of the}} other. Additional insight into defense-in- depth can be gained by thinking of it as forming the layers of an onion, with data at the core of the onion, people the next outer layer of the onion, and network security, <b>host-based</b> security and application security forming the outermost layers of the onion. [...] Both perspectives are equally valid and each provides valuable insight into the implementation of a good defense-in-depth strategy.|$|E
50|$|Firewalls are {{generally}} categorized as network-based or <b>host-based.</b> Network-based firewalls are positioned on the gateway computers of LANs, WANs and intranets. <b>Host-based</b> firewalls are positioned {{on the network}} node itself. The <b>host-based</b> firewall may be a daemon or service {{as a part of}} the operating system or an agent application such as endpoint security or protection. Each has advantages and disadvantages. However, each has a role in layered security.|$|E

50|$|A <b>host-based</b> {{application}} firewall can monitor any application input, output, and/or system service calls made from, to, or by an application. This {{is done by}} examining information passed through system calls instead of or {{in addition to a}} network stack. A <b>host-based</b> {{application firewall}} can only provide protection to the applications running on the same host.|$|E
50|$|Firewalls {{are often}} {{categorized}} as either network firewalls or <b>host-based</b> firewalls. Network firewalls filter traffic between {{two or more}} networks; they are either software appliances running on general purpose hardware, or hardware-based firewall computer appliances. <b>Host-based</b> firewalls provide a layer of software on one host that controls network traffic {{in and out of}} that single machine.|$|E

50|$|<b>Host-based</b> write {{splitting}} is done using {{a device}} driver that is {{installed on the}} server accessing the storage volumes. The usage of a <b>host-based</b> splitter allows replication of selected non-EMC storage. Available fabric-based splitters are for Brocade Communications Systems SAN switches and for Cisco Systems SANTap. This requires the investment in additional switch blades. This configuration allows splitting from all operating systems regardless of their version, and is agnostic to the storage array vendor.|$|E

50|$|<b>Host-based</b> {{intrusion}} prevention system: Comodo's <b>host-based</b> {{intrusion prevention system}} (HIPS), named Defense+, {{is designed}} to provide protection against unknown malware. It is designed to restrict the actions of unknown applications, and restrict access to important files, folders, settings and the Windows Registry. Defense+ by default refuses any unknown program to install or execute except when specifically allowed by the user or when the file appears on Comodo's whitelist. In CIS 4.0 a sandbox was added to Defense+ to isolate and run unknown applications.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the regular}} {{interaction}} between a client and a server, the only requests related to authentication {{are about the}} <b>host-based</b> access method. In particular, a client can request this method to be enabled and can request reading and changing the list of hosts (clients) that are authorized to connect. Typical applications do not use these requests; they are used by the [...] program to give a user or a script access to the host access list. The <b>host-based</b> access method is considered insecure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Host-based</b> zoning {{is usually}} {{referred}} to as persistent binding or LUN, and is perhaps the least implemented form of zoning. Because it requires the host configuration to be correct {{in order to avoid}} zoning conflicts, this form of zoning creates a greater opportunity for administrative errors and conflicting access to targets. Moreover zoning interfaces vary among different host operating systems and HBA's — increasing the possibility for administrative errors. If a host is not configured with the zoning software, it can access all devices in the fabric and create an even higher probability of data corruption. <b>Host-based</b> zoning is often used when clusters are implemented to control the mapping of devices to specific target IDs. However, it should never be the only form of zoning. Augmenting <b>host-based</b> zoning with storage- and fabric-based zoning is the only acceptable method to reliably control device access and data security.|$|E
