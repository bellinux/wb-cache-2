500|$|Hurst Castle was {{designed}} to protect the western entrance to the Solent, a body of water that led from the English Channel to the naval base at Portsmouth and, through Southampton Water, to the important port of Southampton. The castle was one of four fortifications that William Fitzwilliam, the Lord Admiral, and William Paulet recommended building to strengthen the defences along the Solent; the others were at East and West Cowes, and Calshot. It was positioned on the Hurst Spit, a strip of shingle sheltering saltmarsh and mud flats, only [...] across the water from the Isle of Wight. Temporary earthwork fortifications were erected on the site and, after the other three castles had been completed, work then began on Hurst in 1541 under the direction of John Mille, the <b>financial</b> <b>controller,</b> and probably Thomas Bertie, a master mason. Bertie was appointed as the castle's captain in 1542 and the work was completed by January 1544, at a cost of over £3,200.|$|E

Buchanan describes him as, [...] "hasty and passionate, otherwise a good man, skilled in the arts both of peace and war."
