5|$|During {{the early}} centuries AD, Palmyra {{was a city}} {{subordinate}} to Rome {{and part of the}} province of Syria Phoenice. In 260 the Roman emperor Valerian marched against the Sassanid Persian monarch Shapur I, who had invaded the empire's eastern regions; Valerian was defeated and captured near Edessa. Odaenathus, formally loyal to Rome and its emperor Gallienus (Valerian's son), was declared king of Palmyra. Launching successful campaigns against Persia, he was crowned King of Kings of the East in 263. Odaenathus crowned his eldest son, Herodianus, as co-ruler. In addition to the royal titles, Odaenathus received many Roman titles, most importantly corrector totius orientis (governor of the entire East), and ruled the Roman territories from the Black Sea to Palestine. In 267, when Zenobia was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>late</b> <b>twenties</b> or early thirties, Odaenathus and his eldest son were assassinated while returning from a campaign.|$|E

25|$|Grevers next {{played at}} ODI level at the 1989 European Championship in Denmark, {{which had been}} granted that status for the first time. She went wicketless in her first game, against England, but against Denmark took the first three wickets to fall, {{finishing}} with career-best figures of 3/10 from 11 overs (including seven maidens). She also topscored in that match with 24 not out in a team total of 135 all out, despite coming in ninth in the batting order. Grevers' final ODIs came at the 1990 edition of the same tournament, when she was aged <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>late</b> <b>twenties.</b> However, in three matches, she took only a single wicket, finishing with 1/15 against Denmark. Grevers finished her ODI career having taken seven wickets from 13 matches, {{at an average of}} 48.85, an economy rate of 3.42, and a strike rate of 85.71 (close to one wicket for every 14 overs bowled).|$|E

500|$|Olivia died of {{complications}} {{brought on by}} gall bladder disease on 3October1938. The day before her death she {{wrote in a letter}} to Dorothy: [...] "On Monday I was taken suddenly ill with gall bladder trouble—awful pain—sent for Doctor Barnes—he gave me dope & an injection and pain gradually went... He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that time we have never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. When I first met her she was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>late</b> <b>twenties</b> but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she was a lovely old woman... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through all the air raids. She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. I will find her memory everywhere.|$|E

50|$|A study {{published}} by the American Journal of Human Genetics performed an EHMT1 mutation analysis on 23 patients that showed symptoms of q934 syndrome. The patients all varied in age. With respect to all the analyses, however, the clinical data focused on five patients, the majority being children. The first patient developed epilepsy early on in childhood, and had speech problems past age 8. He suffered from hypoplasia and had prominent facial features, such as lips and mouth. The second patient had no trace of mitral regurgitation (MR) <b>in</b> <b>her</b> family history, but had slight hypotonia. Patient three was the oldest at 36 who began to walk at age 3. She later gained weight at eleven and developed epilepsy <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>late</b> <b>twenty's.</b> The fourth patient had problems associated with eating {{as a young child}} and was diagnosed with slowed development. Patient five had behavioural issues and struggled with MR in addition to being overweight. The geneticists discovered three new mutations within the EHMT1 gene. The first was an interstitial deletion, while the second and third were a nonsense and frameshift. Their findings supported the notion that a disruption in the EHMT1 gene contributes to the pathogenesis of Kleefstra syndrome.|$|R

5|$|Heian {{women were}} {{traditionally}} excluded from learning Chinese, the written language of government, but Murasaki, raised <b>in</b> <b>her</b> erudite father's household, showed a precocious aptitude for the Chinese classics {{and managed to}} acquire fluency. She married <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mid-to <b>late</b> <b>twenties</b> and {{gave birth to a}} daughter before her husband died, two years after they were married. It is uncertain when she began to write The Tale of Genji, but it was probably while she was married or shortly after she was widowed. In about 1005, Murasaki was invited to serve as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Shōshi at the Imperial court, probably because of her reputation as a writer. She continued to write during her service, adding scenes from court life to her work. After five or six years, she left court and retired with Shōshi to the Lake Biwa region. Scholars differ on the year of her death; although most agree on 1014, others have suggested she was alive in 1031.|$|R

5000|$|Dobrawa's date {{of birth}} is not known. The only {{indication}} is communicated by the chronicler Cosmas of Prague, who stated that the Bohemian princess {{at the time of}} her marriage with Mieszko I was an old woman. The passage is regarded as tendentious and of little reliability, and some researchers believe that the statement was made with malicious intent. It is possible that in the statement about Dobrawa's age, Cosmas was making a reference to the age difference between her and her sister Mlada. That would give him a basis for determining Dobrawa as [...] "old." [...] It also found that Cosmas confuses Dobrawa with Mieszko I's second wife Oda, who {{at the time of her}} marriage was around 19-25 years old, a relatively advanced age for a bride according to the customs of the Middle Ages. Some researchers have taken up speculative views, such as Jerzy Strzelczyk, who assumed that in the light of contemporary concepts and habits of marriage of that time (when as a rule marriages were contracted with teenage girls) is assumed that Dobrawa had passed her early youth, so, it's probable that she was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>late</b> teens or <b>twenties.</b>|$|R
