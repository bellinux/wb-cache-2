Tietjens encamped outside my bedroom window, and storm after storm came up, thundered on the thatch, and died away. The {{lightning}} spattered {{the sky as}} a thrown egg spattered a barn door, but the light was pale blue, not yellow; and looking through my slit bamboo blinds, I could see the great dog standing, not sleeping, in the veranda, the hackles alift on her back, and her feet planted as tensely as the <b>drawn</b> <b>wire</b> rope of a suspension bridge. In the very short pauses of the thunder I tried to sleep, but it seemed that some one wanted me very badly. He, whoever he was, was trying to call me by name, but his voice {{was no more than}} a husky whisper. Then the thunder ceased and Tietjens went into the garden and howled at the low moon. Somebody tried to open my door, and walked about and through the house, and stood breathing heavily in the verandas, and just when I was falling asleep I fancied that I heard a wild hammering and clamoring above my head or on the door.|$|E

This research started with the modelling of electro hydraulic actuator system by using system identification approach.

40|$|Abstract. High speed multi pass wet <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> {{has become}} very common for {{production}} of high carbon steel cord because {{of the increase in}} customer demand and production rates in real industrial fields. Although the wet <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> is preformed at a high speed usually above 1000 m/min, greater speed is required to improve productivity. However, in the high carbon steel <b>wire</b> <b>drawing,</b> the <b>wire</b> temperature rises greatly as the drawing speed increase. The excessive temperature rise makes the wire more brittle and finally leads to wire breaks. In this study, the variations in wire temperature during wet <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> process were investigated.

40|$|AbstractA non-circular drawing {{sequence}} {{was investigated}} for manufacturing {{medium carbon steel}} wires with improved spheroidization of cementite for better cold workability compared to those produced by the conventional wire drawing. The wire drawing and non-circular drawing processes with 20 % area reduction per each pass were numerically and experimentally applied up to the fourth pass (total area reduction of 59 %). The <b>drawn</b> <b>wire</b> by the non-circular drawing sequence shows higher average effective strain value than {{the one of the}} wire drawing in the numerical result. To investigate the effect of prior cold working on spheroidization of the <b>drawn</b> <b>wire,</b> spheroidization annealing was conducted at subcritical temperature of 705 oC for 2 h for both processes. According to the present investigation, the wires subject to subcritical annealing following the non-circular drawing sequence showed the reduced ultimate tensile strength and micro-hardness, and the enhanced reduction of area compared to those for the wire drawing. From upsetting test results, cold workability was also improved for the annealed specimen processed by the non-circular drawing sequence compared to the one produced by the wire drawing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to investigate microstructure changes during spheroidization annealing. Owing to the SEM results, the spheroidization of the annealed specimens processed by the non-circular drawing sequence was improved than the one produced by the wire drawing. It is demonstrated that the non-circular drawing sequence could manufacture the wires with improved spheroidization of cementite and cold workability compared to the wire drawing in the present work...|$|E
