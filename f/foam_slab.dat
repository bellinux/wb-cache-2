40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} decomposition and burning behaviours of polyurethane foams experimentally and compares the experimental results obtained with the numerical {{results from the}} pyrolysis model of Fire Dynamics Simulator, Version 5 (FDS 5). Based on the comparison of model and experimental heat release rates, {{the accuracy of the}} pyrolysis model is quantified. In total, this research tested seven polyurethane foams consisting of three non-fire retardant (NFR) and four fire retardant (FR) foams. According to the simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis (SDT) experiments, the decomposition behaviour of polyurethane foams under nitrogen environment is represented by two pyrolysis reactions. The first reaction consists of foam decomposition into melts and gases while the second reaction consists of the decomposition of the remaining melts into gases. The kinetic properties which govern the rate of decomposition are the activation energy (E), pre-exponential factor (A), reaction order (n) and heat of reaction (Δhr). Using graphical techniques, E, A and n of the first and second reactions are determined from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results. Through analysing the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results, Δhr is determined from the changes in heat flow and sample mass. The thermophysical properties govern the heat transfer through material and these are the thermal conductivity (λ) and specific heat (cp) which are measured experimentally at ambient temperature through the Hot Disk method. Through the Sample Feeding Vertical Cone, the decomposition and melting behaviours of polyurethane foams in a vertical orientation are investigated and the foams tested can be categorised into those which produce melts only after ignition and those which produce melts and char after ignition. The 1 -dimensional burning behaviour of foams is obtained from the cone calorimeter experiments. The NFR foams show a change from plateau burning behaviour at low heat flux to two stage burning behaviour at high heat flux while the FR foams consistently show two stage burning behaviour. The combustion property governs the amount of heat released when fuel combusts and this is the effective heat of combustion (Δhc,eff) which is determined from the heat released and mass consumed in the cone experiment. The 1 -dimensional burning behaviour is simulated using the pyrolysis model of FDS 5 and two different modelling approaches are considered. The direct method uses the material properties determined experimentally as FDS 5 inputs while the refined method uses the genetic algorithm of Gpyro to refine the kinetic properties which are later used as FDS 5 inputs. The heat release rate of the model and experiment are compared through linear regression analysis which quantifies the accuracy of both methods. The accuracy is defined as the percentage of data points within the boundary of acceptance which is bounded by 25 % of the greatest experimental heat release rate. This assessment method places greater emphasis on the accuracy of developed burning phases and lesser emphasis on the accuracy of initial growth and final decay. The accuracy of the direct method is found to be 56 % while the refined method with estimated kinetic properties achieves a higher accuracy of 75 %. The 2 -dimensional burning behaviours are investigated in the <b>foam</b> <b>slab</b> experiments for two different slab thicknesses, 120 and 100 mm. The opposed-flow spread of 120 mm slab is more intense and rapid while for the 100 mm slab, the flame spread is less intense and slow. FDS 5 is used to simulate the experimental results but when the material properties either developed experimentally or refined by Gpyro are used as inputs, the model fails to produce flame spread. This is because FDS 5 does not yet have the features which address the dynamics of foam melting and the reactive nature of the flame. In order to produce flame spread in the model, E of the reactions have been reduced to increase the decomposition rate...|$|E

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{models are}} used {{extensively}} by fire protection engineers for performance based design and forensic analysis. The {{equations of motion}} describing the gas phase are relatively well known and the approximations in the various gas phase sub-models have been extensively studied. However, coupling of the gas phase and the condensed phase to describe flame spread over a burning solid, {{has proven to be}} difficult to model. This is {{due to a lack of}} understanding of the underlying physical phenomena that take place during the decomposition of the solid as well as poor characterization of the fundamental material properties that control the burning process. The overall goal of this project is to improve the capability of the fire models to predict flame spread over materials that typically burn in a compartment fire. In this paper, we attempt to simulate fire growth and spread on 10 cm thick <b>slabs</b> of polyurethane <b>foam.</b> A multi-layered, multi-material model was developed to simulate flame spread, and material properties were obtained from various small scale experiments.

This led to an overall decrement of 71 % in the experimentally measured strength value compared to the deduced value for uncoated microballoons specimens. The large strengths for uncoated microballoons specimens {{can be traced to the}} presence of the curvilinear marks in the matrix that, incidentally, are absent in the case of paraffin oil coated specimens.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Microballoons (hollow particles) of {{the same}} outer radius but with five {{different}} inner radius values are used to fabricate five types of syntactic <b>foam</b> <b>slabs.</b> These five types of slabs are used as the core material to fabricate sandwich composites. Three- and four-point bending and short beam shear strength tests are carried out to characterize the flexural behavior of syntactic foam core sandwich composites. The effect of change in microballoon radius ratio (ratio of the inner to the outer radius) on the flexural properties of the sandwich composites is also studied. The results show that in three- and four-point bending tests, the failure is governed by tensile properties of the foam core and the strength is not affected by the microballoon radius ratio. Shear failure takes place in short beam shear tests, which makes the microballoon radius ratio {{an important factor in}} determining the strength of the sandwich composite...|$|R

40|$|In Australia, {{sandwich}} {{panels are}} commonly made of flat or lightly profiled steel faces and expanded polystyrene foam cores, and are increasingly used as roof and wall claddings in industrial and commercial buildings. Flexural wrinkling {{is often the}} governing criterion {{in the design of}} these panels. The use of lightly profiled faces is expected to increase the flexural wrinkling stress considerably whereas the presence of joints between the polystyrene <b>foam</b> <b>slabs</b> in the transverse direction introduces a reduction to the flexural wrinkling stress. Therefore a series of full scale experiments and finite element analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of lightly profiled faces and transverse joints on the flexural wrinkling stress of panels subjected to a lateral pressure loading.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{focuses on}} the use of metal foams, a {{relatively}} new class of materials, for high added-value electromagnetic (EM) shields. First, the Shielding Effectiveness (SE) of aluminum <b>foam</b> <b>slabs</b> is experimentally evaluated, showing very good shielding properties. Successively, accurate numerical models of metal foams are proposed and used in a proprietary Variable-Mesh Parallel Finite Difference Time Domain code, in order to characterize the EM properties of slabs of such materials. Afterwards, a third approach is adopted. It consists in the application of the effective medium theories in order to obtain an analytical EM model of the metal foams; this way, their SE can be evaluated with a negligible computational time by using common mathematical tools. Finally, a methodology to design/analyze customized metal foams for EM shield applications is suggested. It takes advantage from the joint use of the numerical and analytical presented approaches, thus allowing a computationally efficient evaluation of SE and other electromagnetic properties of metal foams. Results demonstrate the suitability of metal foam structures for effective EM shielding in many industrial applications, as well as the accuracy of the proposed analytical and numerical approaches. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this work {{was to develop a}} low-conductivity, economical, {{environmentally}} benign insulation. Specific objectives were to develop the following: (1) a very low conductivity use as ``super insulation`` in refrigerators, and (2) a general-purpose insulation for buildings and other applications. The technical goals {{of this work}} were to minimize gas phase, solid phase, and radiative conductivity. The novel approach pursued to achieve low gas phase conductivity was to blow foam with a removable gas or vapor, encapsulate the foam panel in a pouch made with a barrier film, and introduce a very low conductivity gas as the insulating gas phase. For super insulation and general-purpose insulation, the gases of choice were xenon and krypton, respectively. To control cost, the gases were present at low pressure, and the insulating panel was encapsulated with an impermeable polymeric film. Solid-phase conductivity was minimized by using low-density, open-cell, polyurethane foam. For super insulation, radiative heat transfer was impeded by placing aluminized Mylar films between relatively transparent 70 -mil <b>foam</b> <b>slabs.</b> For general-purpose insulation, it was projected to impede radiative heat transfer by achieving the same very small cell size with open-cell CO{sub 2 }-blown foam as is now achieved with closed-cell CO{sub 2 }-blown foam...|$|R
40|$|Syntactic foams are new age polymer {{composite}} materials. They find use {{not only}} in aerospace but also in naval applications as marine utility components. Due to their low density, lesser ingression by water and ability to withstand compressive strengths they are considered for sub-sea applications. Dispersing hollow glass microballoons in matrices like, for instance, thermosetting epoxy resins yields on curing the syntactic <b>foam</b> <b>slabs.</b> Due to the differences in densities of epoxy resin and the glass hollow microballoons, the former being heavier than the latter, the resins {{have a tendency to}} settle down. This settling leads to a gradation in the density across the height of the cast sections. This effect, however, is more conspicuous in rectangular slabs of higher thickness, for e. g., in 25 mm size mould used in this work. Hence, to study such distribution differences, 3 mm thick sections are sliced from the different sections along the thickness part of the slab from which tension test coupons are made and tested. From the data, both tensile strengths and moduli are calculated. These increased from 23. 8 to 41. 9 MPa and 2 to 2. 47 GPa, respectively, as the volume% of microballoons in the sliced sections decreased from 43. 9 to 25. 9. Fractographic features, observed on the tension-failed samples, show that higher microballoons' bearing samples (i. e., samples from the top portion of the slabs' thickness) have formations of cavities. The lower microballoons' bearing sample show well marked matrix deformation features. These and other findings are analyzed and the features observed are correlated with the mechanical test results...|$|R

40|$|Rigid {{polyurethane}} foam {{is used in}} many different applications because of its high insulating capacity. CFC- 11 has been the predominant blowing agent due to its advantageous properties, especially its low thermal conductivity. To prevent a depletion of ozone in the stratosphere {{and an increase in}} global warming, the use of CFCs and similar compounds is now being phased out. Less environmentally harmful alternatives thus have to be developed. In order to study the performance of blowing agents their concentration and their distribution in the foam must be measured. A method for analysis of the cell gases in rigid foam was developed. Partial pressures of all gases in the cells could thus be determined as well as the amount of condensed blowing agent. Three methods involving heating and weight-loss determination were elaborated for the determination of the blowing agent distribution in rigid foam. A combustion method was also applied and a method for solvent extraction developed. Experiments were performed both on pieces of foam and on powdered foam. The analytical methods were applied in several studies, mainly on rigid {{polyurethane foam}}s blown with CFC- 11, water or cyclopentane.

40|$|Green roofs {{become more}} and more popular {{especially}} in cities where they can help to improve the microclimate by reduced peak temperatures compared to conventional roof surfaces. They also reduce the gutter loads by rain water retention and save both heating energy in winter and cooling energy in summer. On the other hand, the cooler temperatures in summer may reduce the drying potential of the load bearing structure beneath the green roof. In inverted roofs the permanently humid conditions can lead to moisture accumulation in the <b>foam</b> insulation <b>slabs.</b> Due to a multitude of influencing factors like moisture storage, freezing, evaporation, shading and reduced radiation absorption through the plant cover etc. a simulation of the hygrothermal behaviour of green roofs represents a challenge. Therefore, the hygrothermal conditions of green roofs on wooden structures and on inverted concrete roofs at different locations has been measured and evaluated for several locations in Europe.

40|$|Abstract: Qualitatively {{proposed}} by Mariotte and mathematically formulated by Weibull, the statistical theory of size effect reigned supreme until the 1980 s. However, beginning in 1976, a different, nonstatistical theory of size effect gradually emerged and {{was shown to}} be important for brittle heterogeneous materials, concisely termed “quasibrittle”, which include concrete, fiber composites, sea ice, rocks, stiff cohesive soils, snow <b>slabs,</b> <b>foams,</b> wood, paper, bone and many materials on micrometer scale. In these materials, the maximum load is attained only after the stable formation of either (1) a large fracture process zone (FPZ), with distributed cracking, or (2) a large crack. The lecture first reviews the sources of these type I and II size effects, consisting of the energy release associated with stress redistribution prior to maximum load, and combined in Type I size effect with the statistical weakest link model for a finite chain. Numerical simulation, requiring nonlocal and stochastic approaches, is discussed. The asymptotic matching approach (anchored through dimensional analysis) {{to the development of}} analytical laws for Type I and Type II quasibrittle size effects, is then outlined. It is explained that while in Type 2 material randomness affects only the variance and the tail of the cumulative distribution of RVE strength is unimportant, in Type I it also strongly (though not totally) affects the mean, and the far-left tail plays a major role. This role can be theoretically predicted by nano-fracture mechanics of cracks in the atomic lattice based on crack length dependence of the activation energy barriers for the metastable states of the free energy potential of the atomic lattice. Extensions to reentrant corners, time dependence, and cyclic loading are pointed out. Various structural applications, experimental evidence, and reinterpretation of some structural disasters are discussed. Finally, some important open problems are highlighted...|$|R
