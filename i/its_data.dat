5|$|The Canadian Hot 100 is a {{chart that}} ranks the best-performing singles of Canada. Published by Billboard magazine, <b>its</b> <b>data</b> {{are similar to}} Billboard U.S.-based Hot 100 in that it compiles Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single's weekly {{physical}} and digital sales, as well as airplay. Canada's airplay chart is compiled with information collected from monitoring more than 100 stations that represent rock, country, adult contemporary and contemporary hit radio genres. The online version of the chart features the Canadian flag next to tracks that qualify as Canadian content.|$|E

Astrid identifies several other potential candidates, including a doctor from Massive Dynamic who had already left. By the time Fringe division reaches his home, they find the man, a shapeshifter, already dead.|$|E
5|$|Within Xeromphalina, X.setulipes {{is part of}} {{the section}} Mutabiles, which also {{contains}} X.campanelloides, X.cauticinalis, X.cirris, X.cornui, and X.fraxinophila. Phylogenetic analysis performed by Esteve-Raventós and colleagues concluded that X.setulipes appears to be most closely related to X.fraxinophila, X.cornui, X.campanelloides and X.cauticinalis, the five of which are clearly separate from the group containing X.campanella, X.kauffmanii, X.brunneola, and, possibly, X.junipericola. Data from the large subunit (60S) of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene suggests that the species is most closely related to X.campanelloides, while internal transcribed spacer (<b>ITS)</b> <b>data</b> place it closest to a clade containing X.cauticinalis and X.aff.parvibulbosa (an unidentified species similar, but not identical, to X.parvibulbosa). Further research, analysing the ITS or RPB2 loci, could serve to help clarify the precise relationships of species and positions of clades within the genus.|$|E
