50|$|Shakes are {{cracks in}} timber. Arising in cut timber they {{generally}} cause {{a reduction in}} strength. When found in a log they {{can result in a}} significant amount of waste, when a log is converted to lumber. Apart from <b>heart</b> <b>shakes,</b> often found in trees felled past their best, shakes in a log have no effect on the strength of shake free lumber obtained therefrom.|$|R
60|$|The {{contention}} of interests and desires with honour in her <b>heart</b> <b>shook</b> Charlotte all that night; but good principle prevailed. The wedding {{was to be}} solemnized the very next morning, though for before-mentioned reasons this was hardly known outside the two houses interested; {{and there were no}} visible preparations either at villa or castle. De Stancy and his groomsman--a brother officer--slept at the former residence.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the high risk factors for severe hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Materials and Methods: Retrospective 229 severe HFMD cases from four hospitals in FuYang, HeFei, and BoZhou (Anhui Provincial Hospital, Fuyang City People′s Hospital, No. 2 People′s Hospital of Fuyang and Bozhou city People′s Hospital) in 2008 - 2009 were studied, with 140 mild HFMD cases in the same area. Using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, the high risk factors of HFMD were identified by comparing clinical and laboratory findings between severe cases and mild cases. Results: There {{was a significant difference}} in age, total duration of fever, rate of respiratory and <b>heart,</b> <b>shake</b> of limbs, white blood cell count, blood sugar, and CK-MB between the two groups. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that severe cases were associated with age (< 3 years), withdrawnness and lethargy, shake of limbs, tachycardia, total leukocyte count (≥ 17 × 10 9 /l), blood sugar (≥ 7 mmol/l), and CK-MB (≥ 16 mmol/l). Furthermore, age (< 3 years), withdrawnness, and lethargy, shake of limbs, WBC (≥ 17 × 10 9 /l), and CK-MB (≥ 16 mmol/l) were found to be high risk factors for severe cases after multivariate logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Clinicians should give importance to these risk factors. Early recognition of children at risk and timely intervention is the key to reduce acute mortality and morbidity...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Golden's words labored like a steamer {{in heavy}} seas; the {{throbbing}} of her <b>heart</b> <b>shook</b> them like the throb of the engines. She {{put her hand}} to her right side, shakily, with effort. It lay there, yellow against the white muslin of her nightgown, then fell heavily to the bed, like a dead thing. Una trembled with fear as her mother continued, [...] "My pulse--it's so fast--so hard breathing--side pain." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{he had met}} her in {{the wood}} by chance, [...] And, having drunk her beauty's wildering spell, [...] His <b>heart</b> <b>shook</b> like the pennon of a lance [...] That quivers in a breeze's sudden swell, [...] And thenceforth, in a close-enfolded trance, [...] From mistily golden deep to deep he fell; [...] Till earth did waver and fade far away [...] Beneath the hope in whose warm arms he lay.|$|R
60|$|Low as {{the words}} had been spoken, Elfride had heard them, and awaited Stephen's reply in breathless silence, if that could be called silence where Elfride's dress, at each throb of her <b>heart,</b> <b>shook</b> and {{indicated}} it like a pulse-glass, rustling also against the wall in reply to the same throbbing. The ray of daylight which reached her face lent it a blue pallor in comparison {{with those of the}} other two.|$|R
50|$|The tree {{grows up}} to 20 m high under {{favourable}} circumstances, although such trees are rarely seen nowadays. Since Makassar ebony {{has been a}} woodworkers' favourite for centuries, most {{of it has been}} felled and used in high-quality furniture. The wood is often defective, showing cracks, and in particular <b>heart</b> <b>shakes</b> and splits. It is not easy to dry and is best given ample time for this. Converting logs into boards as soon as possible is recommended.|$|R

60|$|While he was plodding {{towards it}} {{he had a}} disagreeable sense of the dead man’s company at his elbow. The ghost! He seemed to be {{everywhere}} but in his grave. Could one ever shake him off? he wondered. At that moment Miss Moorsom {{came out on the}} verandah; and at once, as if by a mystery of radiating waves, she roused a great tumult in his <b>heart,</b> <b>shook</b> earth and sky together—but he plodded on. Then like a grave song-note in the storm her voice came to him ominously.|$|R

40|$|I write by osmosis. I write by divine decree. I write by <b>heart,</b> the <b>heart</b> <b>shaking</b> itself {{off like}} a dog that has nearly drowned in light. Or the heart dimly lit, {{sputtering}} and darkening, the heart shattering and held together again with duct tape and kindergarten paste. I write by memory, which is a beautiful liar. I write lies. I write in an alternate universe, in bed, hating {{the world and the}} word 2 ̆ 2 I. 2 ̆ 2 I write at a desk and feel virtuous. I write without a thought in my head. I write groveling for love and attention, and indifferent to everyone and everything...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{two days}} before you came. I was sitting alone in the twilight. The door opened. I thought I was dreaming. It was she, as {{beautiful}} as ever, richly dressed, happy, comely. She came to pity, to sue for pardon. I let her talk, and then, when I had gathered strength, I stood up and cursed her. I thrust her away; I cursed her with the fiercest and crudest words which my lips could utter. It drove the warm color from her cheeks, and the light from her eyes. I cursed her till her <b>heart</b> <b>shook</b> with fear. She staggered {{out of the room}} a stricken woman. I----" ...|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. I feel my <b>heart</b> even <b>shake</b> at the {{thoughts}} of coming into such a state. Hell! who knows that is yet alive, what the torments of hell are? This word HELL gives a very dreadful sound.|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS (surprised, {{looking at}} Craven and realizing his {{distress}} with genuine concern). I'm very sorry. Come, Craven; don't {{take it to}} <b>heart.</b> (Craven <b>shakes</b> his head.) I assure you it means nothing: it happens to me constantly.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{she prayed}} to Umslopogaas in her low sweet voice, and his <b>heart</b> was <b>shaken</b> in him, though, indeed, {{he did not}} now purpose to give Nada to Dingaan, as Baleka was given to Chaka, perhaps in the end to meet the fate of Baleka.|$|R
60|$|Well, it is {{very curious}} to notice what ideas will come into a man's head sometimes. Sometimes {{something}} waves a magic wand over his being, and from the recesses of his soul dim things arise and walk. At unexpected moments they come, and he grows aware of the issues of his mysterious life, and his <b>heart</b> <b>shakes</b> and shivers like a lightning-shattered tree. In that drear light all earthly things seem far, and all unseen things draw near and take shape and awe him, and he knows not what is true and what is false, neither can he trace the edge that marks off the Spirit from the Life. Then {{it is that the}} footsteps echo, and the ghostly footprints will not be stamped out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet what {{a mockery}} it is, miss," [...] {{he said with}} his hand upon his <b>heart</b> and <b>shaking</b> his head at me in a melancholy manner over the tray, [...] "to be {{stationed}} behind food at such a moment. The soul recoils from food at such a moment, miss." ...|$|R
60|$|Archie and Mac looked well {{pleased and}} promised their advice and {{assistance}} with {{the enthusiasm of}} generous young <b>hearts.</b> Steve <b>shook</b> his head, but said nothing, and the lads on the rug at once proposed founding a hospital for invalid dogs and horses, white mice, and wounded heroes.|$|R
50|$|Oddly enough, Emperor Xuan {{believed}} that he could seize part of Northern Qi territory after Northern Zhou's victory, and he sent Wu Mingche to again advance north. In winter 577, Wu put Pengcheng (彭城, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) under siege, and Emperor Xuan was confident that Wu would {{soon be able to}} capture the region south of the Yellow River. When the official Cai Jingli (蔡景歷) warned otherwise, he was so displeased that he demoted Cai to the post of a commandery governor. In spring 578, the Northern Zhou general Wang Gui (王軌) thoroughly crushed Wu, capturing him. Regretting his actions, Emperor Xuan recalled Cai to the capital. With the people's <b>hearts</b> <b>shaken</b> by the great defeat, in fall 578, Emperor Xuan held a ceremony in which the officials reaffirmed their loyalty to the state.|$|R
60|$|I {{felt very}} glad now, {{that the drug}} {{administered}} in the sweet draught had filled me with a possession which made bed and chamber intolerable. I always, through my whole life, liked to penetrate to the real truth; I like seeking the goddess in her temple, and handling the veil, and daring the dread glance. O Titaness among deities! the covered outline of thine aspect sickens often through its uncertainty, but define to us one trait, show us one lineament, clear in awful sincerity; we may gasp in untold terror, but with that gasp we drink in a breath of thy divinity; our <b>heart</b> <b>shakes,</b> and its currents sway like rivers lifted by earthquake, but we have swallowed strength. To see and know the worst is to take from Fear her main advantage.|$|R
60|$|As he pondered, {{his hands}} grew slower in their action and, at last, {{he stopped and}} leaned against the wagon-box. Something came into his <b>heart</b> that <b>shook</b> him, a feeling of unknown power, a {{certainty}} of faith in himself. He shivered with an electric thrill that made his hair stir.|$|R

6000|$|... "Would that I {{could see}} its walls crumble to dust!" [...] thought the chief justice; and, in the {{bitterness}} of his <b>heart,</b> he <b>shook</b> his fist at the famous hall.

The seditious harangues of demagogues in Faneuil Hall have made rebels of a loyal people and deprived me of my country." ...|$|R

60|$|Before Mr. Carey {{could speak}} the door burst open and Mr. Watson {{swept into the}} room. To Philip he seemed gigantic. He {{was a man of}} over six feet high, and broad, with {{enormous}} hands and a great red beard; he talked loudly in a jovial manner; but his aggressive cheerfulness struck terror in Philip's <b>heart.</b> He <b>shook</b> hands with Mr. Carey, and then took Philip's small hand in his.|$|R
60|$|He came up {{the steep}} bank by the Dawson barracks with {{fluttering}} <b>heart</b> and <b>shaking</b> knees. The dogs were so weak that {{he was forced to}} rest them, and, waiting, he leaned limply against the gee-pole. A man, an eminently decorous-looking man, came sauntering by in a great bearskin coat. He glanced at Rasmunsen curiously, then stopped and ran a speculative eye over the dogs and the three lashed sleds.|$|R
60|$|Bostil never had. His <b>heart</b> swelled. Something <b>shook</b> him. Was {{that his}} girl--that tight little gray burr half {{hidden in the}} huge stallion's flaming mane? The {{distance}} had been close between Lucy and the bunched riders.|$|R
60|$|Bostil had the <b>heart</b> to <b>shake</b> {{hands with}} Holley {{and say he}} was glad, when it was on his lips to blurt out {{there had been no}} race. Then Bostil's nerves tingled at sight of Van {{trotting}} the King up the course toward the slope. Bostil watched with searching eyes. Sage King {{did not appear to be}} injured. Van rode straight up the slope and leaped off. He was white and shaking.|$|R
50|$|Then history repeats. Jordan {{suffers a}} <b>heart</b> attack, <b>shaking</b> {{his family to}} their core. In {{the middle of a}} night, three years on from the death of her son, Penelope fights for her husband at a {{hospital}} bedside. Desperate to reclaim his life, Jordan races to quit his oppressive job in spectacular and uncharacteristic fashion on his bosses doorstep.

6000|$|Anderson's laugh {{rang out}} with a jingle of tableware. He was eating his supper. Then Lenore heard her mother and Rose and Kathleen all burst out with news of a letter come that day from Jim, away {{training}} to be a soldier. It was Rose who read this letter aloud to her father, and outside of her swift, soft voice the absolute silence attested {{to the attention of}} the listeners. Lenore's <b>heart</b> <b>shook</b> as she distinguished a phrase here and there, for Jim's letter had been wonderful for her. He had gained weight! He was getting husky enough to lick his father! He was feeling great! There was not a boy in the outfit who could beat him to a stuffed bag of a German soldier! And he sure could make some job with that old bayonet! So ran Jim's message to the loved ones at home. Then a strange pride replaced the quake in Lenore's heart. Not now would she have had Jim stay home. She had sacrificed him. Something subtler than thought told her she would never see him again. And, oh, how dear he had become! ...|$|R
