5|$|After {{appearing}} in Bus Stop (1956), Monroe founded her own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, in 1955; the company produced one film independently, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). Monroe then appeared in Some Like It Hot (1959) and The Misfits (1961). She was {{suspended from the}} filming of Something's Got to Give in June 1962, and the film remained uncompleted when she died in August. Although she was a top-billed actress <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> decade, her films grossed $200 million {{by the time of}} her unexpected death in 1962.|$|E
5|$|After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, {{the ship}} was used {{primarily}} to train gunners and engine room personnel, as the US Navy had expanded significantly to combat the German U-boat campaign. She escorted convoys in late 1918, {{and after the war}} ended she took part in the effort to bring American soldiers back from France. New Hampshire remained in service <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few years after the war, as the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty significantly reduced the navies of the signatories; as a result, {{the ship was}} sold for scrap in November 1923.|$|E

5|$|Although many {{of these}} early schools were open <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> short time, efforts persisted. The Mohawk Institute Residential School, the oldest, {{continuously}} operated residential school in Canada, opened in 1834 on Six Nations of the Grand River near Brantford, Ontario. Administered by the Anglican Church, the facility opened as the Mechanics' Institute, a day school for boys, in 1828 and became a boarding school four years later when it accepted its first boarders and began admitting female students. It remained in operation until June 30, 1970.|$|E

Other than heads, the player can also find health restoratives, extra points, and extra lives throughout the levels.

5|$|During the English Civil War Manchester {{strongly}} favoured the Parliamentary interest. Although not long-lasting, Cromwell granted it {{the right}} to elect its own MP. Charles Worsley, who sat for the city <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> year, was later appointed Major General for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire during the Rule of the Major Generals. He was a diligent puritan, turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of Christmas; he died in 1656.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> {{small number of}} design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, {{the leading edge of}} the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{after the}} {{workshop}} concluded, an 1884 {{edition of the}} Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention. This publication used an idiosyncratic typeface and featured a handcopy <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> section of the whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition matched the paleography on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as well. This convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained the majority opinion since then.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{tradition}} which started with Userkaf, {{the founder of}} the Fifth Dynasty, Menkauhor built a temple to the sun god Ra. He was the last pharaoh to do so. His successors, Djedkare Isesi and Unas, abandoned this practice as the cult of Ra declined at the expense of that of Osiris. Given the paucity of documents relating to Menkauhor's sun temple, it probably functioned <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> short time or was never completed.|$|E
5|$|Following her {{commissioning}} {{into the}} fleet, Emden {{was assigned to}} the East Asia Squadron. In 1913, Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) Karl von Müller became the ship's commander. At the outbreak of war, Emden was the only major German warship in Tsingtao, the main German naval base in Asia. Müller immediately began to operate as a commerce raider, and captured one ship, the Russian steamer Ryazan. Emden was thereafter ordered to rendezvous with the rest of Spee's cruisers. She remained with the East Asia Squadron <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few days, as Müller convinced Spee to detach Emden as an independent raider in the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Given the {{popularity}} of the film's cars with customizers and hot rodders in the years since its release, their fate immediately after the film is ironic. All were offered for sale in San Francisco newspaper ads; only the '58 Impala (driven by Ronny Howard) attracted a buyer, selling <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few hundred dollars. The yellow Deuce and the white T-bird went unsold, despite being priced as low as US$3,000.
