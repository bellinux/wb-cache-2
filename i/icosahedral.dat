5|$|Complex: These viruses {{possess a}} capsid that is neither purely helical nor purely <b>icosahedral,</b> {{and that may}} possess extra {{structures}} such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of an <b>icosahedral</b> head bound to a helical tail, which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres. This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus is {{composed}} of an RNA genome and a protein capsid. The genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that is about 7500 nucleotides long. The viral particle is about 30 nm in diameter with <b>icosahedral</b> symmetry. Because of its short genome and its simple composition—only RNA and a nonenveloped <b>icosahedral</b> protein coat that encapsulates it, poliovirus {{is widely regarded as}} the simplest significant virus.|$|E
5|$|Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are <b>icosahedral</b> or near-spherical with chiral <b>icosahedral</b> symmetry. A regular {{icosahedron}} is {{the optimum}} way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The {{minimum number of}} identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called hexons. Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved. The same protein may act as the subunit of both the pentamers and hexamers {{or they may be}} composed of different proteins.|$|E
5|$|The genome of {{rotavirus}} {{consists of}} 11 unique double helix molecules of RNA which are 18,555 nucleotides in total. Each helix, or segment, is a gene, numbered 1 to 11 by decreasing size. Each gene codes for one protein, except genes 9, which codes for two. The RNA {{is surrounded by}} a three-layered <b>icosahedral</b> protein capsid. Viral particles are up to 76.5nm in diameter and are not enveloped.|$|E
5|$|A virus particle, {{also known}} as a virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be <b>icosahedral</b> (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.|$|E
5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess <b>icosahedral</b> symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{chemistry of}} boron {{is dominated by}} its small atomic size, and relatively high ionization energy. With only three valence electrons per boron atom, simple covalent bonding cannot fulfil the octet rule. Metallic bonding is the usual result among the heavier congenors of boron but this generally requires low ionization energies. Instead, because of its small size and high ionization energies, the basic structural unit of boron (and nearly all of its allotropes) is the <b>icosahedral</b> B12 cluster. Of the 36 electrons associated with 12 boron atoms, 26 reside in 13 delocalized molecular orbitals; the other 10 electrons are used to form two- and three-centre covalent bonds between icosahedra. The same motif can be seen, as are deltahedral variants or fragments, in metal borides and hydride derivatives, and in some halides.|$|E
5|$|While not {{inside an}} {{infected}} cell {{or in the}} process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles. These viral particles, also known as virions, consist of two or three parts: (i) the genetic material made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry genetic information; (ii) a protein coat, called the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an envelope of lipids that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside a cell. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and <b>icosahedral</b> forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others. Most virus species have virions that are too small to be seen with an optical microscope. The average virion is about one one-hundredth the size of the average bacterium.|$|E
5|$|The poxviruses are large, complex {{viruses that}} have an unusual morphology. The viral genome is {{associated}} with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid. The nucleoid {{is surrounded by a}} membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function. The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface. The whole virion is slightly pleiomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick shape. Mimivirus {{is one of the largest}} characterised viruses, with a capsid diameter of 400nm. Protein filaments measuring 100nm project from the surface. The capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the capsid is probably <b>icosahedral.</b> In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces, Chile. Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope. In 2013, the Pandoravirus genus was discovered in Chile and Australia, and has genomes about twice as large as Megavirus and Mimivirus.|$|E

25|$|The coset space Spin(3) / 2I = S3 / 2I is a spherical 3-manifold {{called the}} Poincaré {{homology}} sphere. It {{is an example}} of a homology sphere, i.e. a 3-manifold whose homology groups are identical to those of a 3-sphere. The fundamental group of the Poincaré sphere is isomorphic to the binary <b>icosahedral</b> group, as the Poincaré sphere is the quotient of a 3-sphere by the binary <b>icosahedral</b> group.|$|E
25|$|Picornaviruses are non-enveloped, with an <b>icosahedral</b> capsid. The capsid is an {{arrangement}} of 60 protomers in a tightly packed <b>icosahedral</b> structure. Each protomer consists of 4 polypeptides known as VP (viral protein) 1, 2, 3 and 4. VP2 and VP4 polypeptides originate from one protomer known as VP0 that is cleaved to give the different capsid components. The <b>icosahedral</b> {{is said to have}} a triangulation number of 3, this means that in the <b>icosahedral</b> structure each of the 60 triangles that make up the capsid are split into 3 little triangles with a subunit on the corner.In many picornaviruses have a deep cleft formed by around each of the 12 vertices of icosahedrons.The outer surface of the capsid is composed of regions of VP1, VP2 and VP3. Around each of the vertices is a canyon lined with the C termini of VP1 and VP3. The interior surface of the capsid is composed of VP4 and the N termini of VP1. J.Esposito and Professor Freederick A. Murphy demonstrates cleft structure referred to as canyons, using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy.|$|E

25|$|Like other papillomaviruses, BPVs {{are small}} non-enveloped viruses with an <b>icosahedral</b> capsid around 50–60nm in diameter. The capsid is formed of the L1 and L2 {{structural}} proteins, with the L1 C-terminus exposed.|$|E
25|$|The binary <b>icosahedral</b> {{group is}} perfect, {{meaning that it}} is equal to its {{commutator}} subgroup. In fact, 2I is the unique perfect group of order 120. It follows that 2I is not solvable.|$|E

25|$|Adenoviruses (members of {{the family}} Adenoviridae) are {{medium-sized}} (90–100 nm), nonenveloped (without an outer lipid bilayer) viruses with an <b>icosahedral</b> nucleocapsid containing a double stranded DNA genome.

25|$|The {{hepatitis}} C {{virus particle}} {{consists of a}} core of genetic material (RNA), surrounded by an <b>icosahedral</b> protective shell of protein, and further encased in a lipid (fatty) envelope of cellular origin. Two viral envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2, are embedded in the lipid envelope.|$|E
25|$|They can {{be further}} {{classified}} according to symmetry. For example, the cube and the regular octahedron share the same symmetry, as do the regular dodecahedron and icosahedron. Indeed, symmetry groups are sometimes named after regular polytopes, for example the tetrahedral and <b>icosahedral</b> symmetries.|$|E

25|$|Astrovirus {{is a type}} {{of virus}} that was first {{discovered}} in 1975 using electron microscopes following an outbreak of diarrhea in humans. In addition to humans, astroviruses have now been isolated from numerous mammalian animal species (and are classified as genus Mammoastrovirus) and from avian species such as ducks, chickens, and turkey poults (classified as genus Avastrovirus). Astroviruses are 28–35nm diameter, <b>icosahedral</b> viruses that have a characteristic five- or sixpointed star-like surface structure when viewed by electron microscopy. Along with the Picornaviridae and the Caliciviridae, the Astroviridae comprise a third family of nonenveloped viruses whose genome is composed of plus-sense, single-stranded RNA. Astrovirus has a non-segmented, single stranded, positive sense RNA genome within a non-enveloped <b>icosahedral</b> capsid. Human astroviruses have been shown in numerous studies to be an important cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide.|$|E
