40|$|This paper {{examines}} the returns earned by subscribing to <b>initial</b> <b>public</b> <b>offerings</b> of equity. K.

The authors show that <b>initial</b> <b>public</b> <b>offerings</b> of equity with more informed investor capital require higher returns. The marketing underwriter's reputation reveals the expected level of "informed" activity. Prestigious underwriters are associated with lower risk offerings. With less risk there is less incentive to acquire information and fewer informed investors. Consequently, prestigious underwriters are associated with <b>initial</b> <b>public</b> <b>offerings</b> of equity that have lower returns. Copyright 1990 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of setup costs on the pricing of {{investment}} banking services. The existence of setup costs is predicted to result in lower underwriter spreads in <b>initial</b> <b>public</b> <b>offerings</b> for firms {{that are expected to}} issue again. Consistent with this prediction, the author finds significantly lower spreads for firms that make subsequent issues. He also finds that a firm's likelihood of changing underwriters in a subsequent offer is related to the time between offerings and the underwriter's pricing performance in the <b>initial</b> <b>public</b> <b>offerings.</b> These results suggest that the deviations from optimal <b>initial</b> <b>public</b> <b>offerings</b> pricing carry a penalty for the underwriter.
