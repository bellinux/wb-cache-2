40|$|Nitrogen-functionalized carbon {{nanotubes}} were synthesized by grafting amino {{groups to}} the surface of the nanotubes. The nanotubes exhibited promising results in the base-catalyzed liquid phase transesterification of <b>glyceryl</b> <b>tributyrate</b> with methanol, which is a model reaction for the production of biodiesel. The concentration of the active sites and the reaction parameters, such as temperature and <b>glyceryl</b> <b>tributyrate</b> to methanol ratio, were shown to significantly affect catalytic performance. The grafting technique employed allowed for design and control of the active sites. As a consequence, it was possible to design a nitrogen-functionalized carbon nanotube catalyst with a few strong, basic groups. This might be of interest for carbohydrate conversion reactions where strong basic sites are required but the pH of the solution should remain mild to avoid the degradation of the reactants and/or products...|$|E

Small, cubic MgO single crystals, generated by low temperature processing, expose weakly basic (100) surfaces. High temperature annealing transforms these into large, stepped cuboidal nanoparticles of periclase MgO which terminate in more basic (110) and (111) surfaces.

XRD reveals that the dolomitic rock comprised 77 % dolomite and 23 % magnesian calcite. The generation of basic sites requires calcination at 900 °C, which increases the surface area and transforms the mineral into MgO nanocrystallites dispersed over CaO particles.

A Li content of 1. 23 wt% provides the optimum activity towards methyl butanoate formation. Li doping increases the base strength of CaO, and XPS and DRIFTS measurements reveal that the optimum loading correlates {{with the formation of}} an electron deficient surface Li+ species and associated –OH species at defect sites on the support.

All materials exhibit XRD patterns characteristic of the hydrotalcite phase with a steady lattice expansion observed with increasing Mg content. XPS measurements reveal a decrease in both the Al and Mg photoelectron binding energies with Mg incorporation which correlates with the increased intra-layer electron density.

40|$|A copper-substituted {{hydrotalcite}} (Cu 1. 4 Mg 4. 4 Al 2. 2 (CO 3) 1. 1 (OH) 16) {{has been}} subjected to calcination under feedback-controlled microwave heating, in which microwave power is continuously modulated to generate a defined sample temperature programme or constant sample temperature. The results show that microwave calcination results in enhanced crystallinity of the resultant oxides and spinel phase formed at high temperature, compared to conventional calcination. In addition, an additional phase, Cu 2 MgO 3, is detected following microwave calcination, at a bulk temperature very much lower than previously reported for copper-containing hydrotalcite. The concentrations and strengths of surface basic sites are significantly higher for materials calcined using microwaves than using conventional heating. Catalytic activities in the base-catalysed transesterification of <b>glyceryl</b> <b>tributyrate</b> with methanol are also higher. We suggest that microwave calcination under feedback-control, while allowing control of material bulk temperature during calcination and preventing major temperature excursions, may allow quite large but highly localised temperature variation, for instance as water is released during dehydroxylation, which are beneficial in developing surface defects and surface basicity...|$|E

In this study, the anticancer drug N 4 -myristoyl gemcitabine (a lipophilic form of gemcitabine) was formulated as organogel to achieve a localised depot delivery. Thus, the first goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the suitability of the oragnogel for intartumoural injection and this attained by investigating the thermostability and elasticity of the organogel. Further to this, the second goal was to slow the release of N 4 -myristoyl gemcitabine from the organogel. Accomplishment of these two goals will guarantee a better efficacy of cancer treatment by obtaining direct contact of the organogel containing the N 4 -myristoyl gemcitabine with the cancerous cells.

40|$|Biomass {{conversion}} to transportation fuels and chemicals {{is a growing}} field of research due to the depletion of fossil fuels feedstock. New catalysts, optimized for carbohydrates conversion, need to be developed. In this context, basic heterogeneous catalysts will {{play a major role}} for dehydration, hydrolysis, (trans) esterification, aldol condensation, alkylation or isomerization reactions for example. In contrast to existing basic heterogeneous catalysts, MWCNTs-based catalysts are chemically stable (no leaching) and relatively easy to tailor on a nano- and macro-level (controlled porosity). Therefore, nitrogen-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (N-MWCNTs) appear to be a promising basic catalyst and catalyst support [1, 2]. Unfortunately, the nitrogen concentration, its location in/on the nanotube {{and the nature of the}} formed N-containing functional groups are difficult to control by common synthesis techniques like by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) or by post-treatments [3]. In addition, it is still unclear which functional groups are required to reach high catalytic activities. Thus, we synthesized N-MWCNTs catalysts by grafting desired N-containing molecules on the MWCNTs’ surface. In order to avoid the drawbacks of the traditional SOCl 2 route, a new procedure has been designed.

40|$|A novel {{microbial}} esterase, EaEST, from a {{psychrophilic bacterium}} Exiguobacterium antarcticum B 7, was identified and characterized. To our knowledge, {{this is the}} first report describing structural analysis and biochemical characterization of an esterase isolated from the genus Exiguobacterium. Crystal structure of EaEST, determined at a resolution of 1. 9 Å, showed that the enzyme has a canonical α/β hydrolase fold with an α-helical cap domain and a catalytic triad consisting of Ser 96, Asp 220, and His 248. Interestingly, the active site of the structure of EaEST is occupied by a peracetate molecule, which is the product of perhydrolysis of acetate. This result suggests that EaEST may have perhydrolase activity. The activity assay showed that EaEST has significant perhydrolase and esterase activity with respect to short-chain p-nitrophenyl esters (≤C 8), naphthyl derivatives, phenyl acetate, and <b>glyceryl</b> <b>tributyrate.</b> However, the S 96 A single mutant had low esterase and perhydrolase activity. Moreover, the L 27 A mutant showed low levels of protein expression and solubility as well as preference for different substrates. On conducting an enantioselectivity analysis using R- and S-methyl- 3 -hydroxy- 2 -methylpropionate, a preference for R-enantiomers was observed. Surprisingly, immobilized EaEST was found to not only retain 200 % of its initial activity after incubation for 1 h at 80 °C, but also retained more than 60 % of its initial activity after 20 cycles of reutilization.

40|$|Dietary {{modulation}} of {{the synthesis}} of endogenous host defense peptides (HDPs) represents a novel antimicrobial approach {{for disease control and}} prevention, particularly against antibiotic-resistant infections. However, HDP regulation by dietary compounds such as butyrate is species-dependent. To examine whether butyrate could induce HDP expression in pigs, we evaluated the expressions of a panel of porcine HDPs in IPEC-J 2 intestinal epithelial cells, 3 D 4 / 31 macrophages, and primary monocytes in response to sodium butyrate treatment by real-time PCR. We revealed that butyrate is a potent inducer of multiple, but not all, HDP genes. Porcine b-defensin 2 (pBD 2), pBD 3, epididymis protein 2 splicing variant C (pEP 2 C), and protegrins were induced markedly in response to butyrate, whereas pBD 1 expression remained largely unaltered in any cell type. Additionally, a comparison of the HDP-inducing efficacy among saturated free fatty acids of different aliphatic chain lengths revealed that fatty acids containing 3 – 8 carbons showed an obvious induction of HDP expression in IPEC-J 2 cells, with butyrate being the most potent and long-chain fatty acids having only a marginal effect. We further investigated a panel of butyrate analogs for their efficacy in HDP induction, and found <b>glyceryl</b> <b>tributyrate,</b> benzyl butyrate, and 4 -phenylbutyrate to be comparable with butyrate.

40|$|The batch {{fermentation}} of simple sugars to ethanol {{has thus far}} been the most successful process to displace transportation fuel consumption worldwide. However, the physical properities of ethanol limit its application {{in most of the}} world beyond 10 - 15 vol% blends with conventional gasoline. Additionally, ethanol is too volatile to be blended at an appreciable level with jet and diesel fuels. Alternative technologies are necessary to produce compounds that can be blended in all forms of transportation fuel and to higher levels. The biological production of longer chain oxygenates or hydrocarbons has been purposed to address this challenge. However, the increased toxicity of these molecules has limited their usefulness to-date. Alternatively, chemocatalytic routes to produce these fuel molecules do not suffer from toxicity issues but the highly functional saccharide-based feedstocks result in undesirable by-product formation and yield losses. We propose that by effectively combining these biological and chemocatalytic approaches efficient production of all classes of transportation fuels can be achieved. Clostridium acetobutylicum is a well-studied industrial bacterium capable of fermenting a wide-variety of saccharides into a mixture of acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE). These mixed products contain functionalities that are amenable to C-C bond formation through transition-metal catalysis. Thus enabling the production of a suite of long-chain oxygenates from a variety of sugar substrates. This dissertation describes three major topics associated with the integration biological and chemocatalytic processes for fuel production: (1) the initial discovery and evaluation of such a combined process, (2) tailoring the fermentation products and catalyst to favor diesel production, and (3) engineering tunable ethanol and acetone co-production in Escherichia coli. Additionally, a thorough and reproducible protocol describing both biological and chemocatalytic procedures are provided. Acetone, a product of the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, harbors a nucleophilic &# 945;-carbon, which is amenable to C-C bond formation with the electrophilic alcohols (ethanol and n-butanol) produced in ABE fermentation. This functionality enables the formation of higher molecular weight hydrocarbons similar to those found in current gasoline, jet, and diesel fuels. Using a palladium-catalyzed alkylation reaction efficient conversion of ABE fermentation products into ketones, ranging from 2 -pentanone to 6 -undecanone was achieved. Tuning of the reaction conditions permits production of either predominately gasoline or jet and diesel precursors. <b>Glyceryl</b> <b>tributyrate</b> was identified as a suitable extractant for selective in situ removal of both acetone and alcohols. Enabling simple integration of ABE fermentation and water sensitive chemical catalysis, while reducing the energy demand of the overall process. Additionally, extractive fermentation with <b>glyceryl</b> <b>tributyrate</b> removed several lignocellulosic-derived pretreatment inhibitors completely restoring solvent production titers. Tailoring both the biological fermentation and chemocatalytic reaction conditions predictably increased the production of sustainable diesel blendstocks from lignocellulosic sugar. More specifically, engineering the metabolism of C. acetobutylicum to produce isopropanol-butanol-ethanol (IBE) as opposed to ABE by expression of the secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (sadh) from C. beijerinckii strain B 593. Coupled with the optimization of a more water-resistant alkylation catalyst, hydrotalcite-supported copper(II) or palladium (0). Furthermore, in silco predictions of extraction efficiency using COSMO-RS were employed to identify oleyl alcohol as a superior extractant for in situ removal of IBE. To achieve highly controllable acetone and ethanol production both metabolic and fermentation engineering approaches were employed. Strains capable of producing acetone without carboxylic acid reassimilation through a newly described pathway were developed. Furthermore, a more oxidized sugar-acid (gluconic acid) was used to drive production of acetone through redox balancing of NADH, predicatively reducing the molar ethanol:acetone ratio. Increases in the molar ethanol:acetone ratio were also described by the co-expression of either the aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE) from E. coli MG 1655 or pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adhB) from Z. mobilis. Acetone titers reached wild-type C. acetobutylicum levels by controlling the fermentation sparge rate and pH in a bioreactor. Finally, catalytic strategies to upgrade the co-produced ethanol and acetone at both low and high molar ratios are described. By leveraging the advantages of both biological fermentation and chemocatalytic reactions of fermentation products with well-defined functionality we are able to efficiently convert a variety of saccharides into long-chain oxygenates. These long-chain oxygenates can be blended with all forms of transportation fuels. Additionally, tuning the microorganism's metabolism, fermentation conditions, catalysis reaction, or all of the above can optimize the production for a specific class of fuel. The integration of mixed-product fermentation with chemical catalysis is thus a novel and potentially enabling route for the economical conversion of biomass into liquid transportation fuels...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} links between the structure and dissociation energetics of ionized non-covalent complexes. In chapter 3, a large series of similar non-covalent complexes were probed using electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) and RRKM modelling {{in order to identify}} any trends in the dissociation energetics based on charge state, overall size of the complex, or size of the substrate. Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) in conjunction with molecular mechanics/molecular dynamics (MM/MD) was used to study the conformations of these non-covalent complexes in order to determine if the same trends identified in the energetics could be corroborated independently based on structure. The system of study consisted of varying lengths of the synthetic polymer, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) complexed with singly or doubly protonated diaminoalkanes (DAA) of varying length. The critical energies of dissociation (E 0) increased as the length of the polymer increased and was not significantly affected by the length of the singly protonated DAA substrates. The E 0 of dissociation of doubly protonated complexes was strongly influenced by the length of the DAA; longer DAA substrates had greater separation of charge which decreased coulombic repulsion within the complex resulting in higher E 0 values. MM/MD low energy structures of all complexes were validated with experimental IMS measurements and showed that the arrangement between the polymer and DAA were similar for different singly protonated DAAs. When doubly protonated, the length of DAA was {{the most important factor in}} determining the overall structure of the complex. In chapter 4, a direct link is shown between the observed E 0 dissociation energies and the molecular conformations for eight different peptide–saccharide complexes containing either a tri-saccharide (d-(+) -raffinose and d-panose) or tetra-saccharide (stachyose and maltotetraose) with a small peptide (FLEEL and FLEEV). The E 0 values were highly related to the overall conformation adopted by the non-covalent complex in the gas phase. Complexes containing peptide FLEE(L/V) with the tri-saccharide raffinose or panose had similar E 0 of dissociation (∼ 0. 64 eV) and similar conformations based on MM/MD simulations and IMS drift times. Conversely, for complexes containing a FLEE(L/V) peptide with one of the isomeric tetra-saccharides; stachyose had a E 0 ∼ 0. 08 eV greater than maltotetraose. This difference of intermolecular interaction was also reflected by the IMS drift times; maltotetraose in complex with FLEEV or FLEEL had a 5. 9 % and 2. 3 % faster IMS drift time than stachyose respectively. This indicated that the molecular arrangement between maltotetraose and the peptides was more compact than the stachyose-peptide complexes. In chapter 5, RRKM modelling of breakdown diagrams is not possible when the reactant ion signal is overlapped by other isobaric species. Trimeric, non-covalent complexes that contained two PMMA molecules and a doubly protonated DAA, [(PMMAa) (DAA+ 2 H) (PMMAb) ]+ 2, have m/z signals that contain multiple different complexes having the same total number of polymer repeat units but differ in the length of the each polymer. In this situation, the applicability of using the simple kinetic method to gain insight into relative binding energies was explored. The major factors which determined the suitability of the kinetic method for this system were identified as the structural arrangement of the reactant ion complex, possible reverse activation barriers, and the evaluations of Δ(ΔS‡). MM/MD simulations coupled with IMS suggests that within the reactant ion, the DAA is almost equally shared between two PMMA oligomers and that the two PMMA oligomers interact predominately with the DAA, and not with each other. MS/MS of the trimeric reactant complexes proceeds by neutral loss of one polymer and is suggested to proceed with little or no reverse activation barrier based on the low coulombic repulsion factors. The IMS drift times of [(PMMAa) (DAA+ 2 H) ]+ 2 complexes that were generated directly by ESI-MS or by dissociation of a trimeric, [(PMMAa) (DAA+ 2 H) (PMMAb) ]+ 2 complex were found to be identical. This provides some evidence that Δ(ΔS‡) ≈ Δ(ΔS) and using a statistical mechanics approach, Δ(ΔS) ≈ 0. The effective temperature (Teff) variable in the kinetic method expression was found to decrease as a function of the size of the trimeric complex, suggesting that the population distribution of the dissociating ensemble of complexes narrows as size increases. Overall, when RRKM fitting is not possible, the simple kinetic method could provide relative energetic ranking of competing dissociations reactions however the Teff term contributed to the greatest uncertainty in obtaining absolute quantities. Fitting MS/MS breakdown diagrams of non-covalent complexes with multiple dissociation channels is difficult due to the number of total fitting variables. Building from the simple kinetic method, chapter 6 shows that the relationship between the natural logarithm of competing fragment ions and reciprocal collision energy yields a branching relationship that allows for the sign of Δ(ΔS‡) and Δ(E 0) between the channels to be obtained. Furthermore, the relationships between the fitting variables of RRKM modelling are empirically related to the theoretical branching relationship characteristics. This allowed for the fitting variables of all dissociation channels to be expressed as a function of a single channel so that the theoretical branching relationship matches the experimental branching relationship. Using this method, RRKM fitting of a MS/MS breakdown diagram for APCI ionized anthracene determined the E 0 and ∆S‡ was 4. 69 ± 0. 29 eV and - 3 ± 17 J K- 1; 4. 21 ± 0. 29 eV and - 19 ± 15 J K- 1; and 4. 81 ± 0. 29 eV and 36 ± 22 J K- 1 for hydrogen loss, acetylene loss and diacetylene loss respectively. With one exception, these values are within experimental error of the iPEPICO derived energetic values. In chapter 7, MS/MS of ammoniated triacylglycerides at multiple collision energies and computational analysis are used to explain the cause of uneven dissociation rates of the FAs from different positions on the glycerol backbone. The loss of sn- 1 and sn- 3 FAs are found to have lower activation energies than the loss of the sn- 2 position FA, however the loss of the FA from the sn- 2 position is more entropically favourable. Theoretical MS/MS breakdown curves were fit to experimental values using RRKM theory to estimate the E 0 of dissociation of FAs from the three glycerol positions. The E 0 values for cleavage from the sn- 1 and sn- 3 positions were found to be approximately 1. 52 eV, while that for the sn- 2 position was highly dependent on the identity of the FA at that position. Computational structures and energy analysis suggest that an important step in the dissociation of [TAG+NH 4]+ is the loss of ammonia. In a model system, <b>glyceryl</b> <b>tributyrate,</b> the loss of NH 3 produced two distinct [TAG+H]+ product structures sitting 148 kJ and 160 kJ in energy above the ammoniated structure. The [TAG+H]+ structure that leads to the loss of the sn- 1 (3) is 12 kJ lower than the [TAG+H]+ structure that leads to the loss of the sn- 2 FA. From this, the loss of a neutral FA that follows sits only an additional 35 – 48 kJ above the [TAG+H]+ structures. In Chapter 8, singly deprotonated β-cyclodextrin monomers, [(β-CD-H+]- 1, and doubly deprotonated dimers, [(β-CD) 2 - 2 H+]- 2, are both present following ESI-MS and have the same monoisotopic m/z. Similar to chapter 5, this makes it difficult to generate an MS/MS breakdown diagrams that can be modelled with RRKM theory. IMS was used to mobility separate [(β-CD-H+]- 1 and [(β-CD) 2 - 2 H+]- 2 and was followed by MS/MS of the [(β-CycD) 2 - 2 H+]- 2 ion. A second problem when generating a MS/MS breakdown diagram of non-covalent complexes that contain identical components is that the fragment ions could have an identical monoisotopic m/z as the reactant ion. MS/MS of [(β-CycD) 2 - 2 H+]- 2 results in two [(β-CD-H+]- 1 fragments. To overcome this, breakdown diagrams were then generated by monitoring the changes in the isotopic profile. The RRKM derived E 0 for dissociation of [(β-CycD) 2 -H+]- 1 and [(β-CycD) 2 - 2 H+]- 2 were 1. 85 ± 0. 11 eV and 1. 79 ± 0. 09 eV, respectively, corresponding to a slight decrease in complex stability due to increased charge-charge repulsion in the dianion...|$|E
