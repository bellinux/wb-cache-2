25|$|When {{the ground}} is not {{available}} (such as in a vehicle) other metallic surfaces {{can serve as a}} ground plane (typically the vehicle's roof). Alternatively, radial wires placed {{at the base of the}} antenna can form a ground plane. For VHF and UHF bands, the radiating and ground plane elements can be constructed from rigid rods or tubes. For a simple 1/4-wave whip, the radials are often sloped at a 45 degree angle to bring the feed point impedance closer to 50 ohms. Since this will introduce RF energy on the shield of the unbalanced <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> which deforms the radiation pattern of the antenna, a choke is often placed near the feed point.|$|E

40|$|In the Republic of Croatia declining {{trend in}} the number of milk {{suppliers}} is registered, (69. 3 % decline in the year 2010 compared to the 2002). Since the EU expects to abolish production quotas in the future (after the years 2014 / 2015), and reduce different protections for milk producers, there will be a decrease in the price of European milk. According to some predictions price will decrease for 5 - 15 % in the most of the EU countries, and this will be subsequently reflected in the Republic of Croatia. Mentioned facts will force milk producers to maximize business rationalization. At dairy farm, the highest cost is for animal feed, it is an ideal starting point for the implementation of business rationalization procedures. Previous studies show that the production of own animal feed can reduce the feeding cost by 30 - 50 %, compared to purchased fodder. Therefore, this study seeks to determine the effect of different forage courses on dairy farm profitability and cost of milk per kg.

50|$|Matching the {{impedance}} of {{the antenna}} to {{the impedance of}} the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> can sometimes be accomplished through adjusting the antenna itself, but otherwise is possible using an antenna tuner, an impedance matching device. Installing the tuner between the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> and the antenna allows for the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> to see a load close to its characteristic impedance, while sending most of the transmitter's power (a small amount may be dissipated within the tuner) to be radiated by the antenna despite its otherwise unacceptable feed point impedance. Installing a tuner in between the transmitter and the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> can also transform the impedance seen at the transmitter end of the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> to one preferred by the transmitter. However, in the latter case, the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> still has a high SWR present, with the resulting increased <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> losses unmitigated.|$|E

The design frequency is 5. 8 GHz. Pin diodes are used to short the ASA in pre-selected positions along the circumference.
