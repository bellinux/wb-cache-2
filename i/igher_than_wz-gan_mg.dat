40|$|As a {{first step}} in {{assessing}} the viability of periphyton-based fish production in South Asian pond aquaculture systems, the effects of artificial substrates on development of periphyton and on water quality were evaluated. Earthen ponds (10 x 7. 5 m) were provided with an artificial substrate constructed from poles of either bamboo, kanchi or hizol tree branches (1. 0 m 2 artificial substrate per m 2 pond surface). Higher periphyton biomass, in terms of dry matter (DM) (4. 9 mg cm– 2) and chlorophyll a (11. 5 g cm– 2) developed on hizol and bamboo, respectively. Periphyton ash content was higher on hizol (41 €than on the other two substrate types (29 Ž Protein content of the periphyton growing on bamboo (38 f ash-free dry matter (AFDM)) was 50 <b>igher</b> <b>than</b> that on the other two substrate types. Maximum periphyton productivities of 1. 01, 1. 38 and 1. 03 g C m– 2 d– 1 were obtained for bamboo, hizol and kanchi substrates, respectively. Taxonomic composition of periphyton showed a rapid development of a relatively stable community with few differences between the substrate types. In total, 56 genera of algal periphyton and 35 genera of phytoplankton were identified. Based on a periphyton productivity estimate of 2. 2 – 2. 8 g AFDM m– 2 d– 1, periphyton alone can sustain an estimated fish production of 5000 kg ha– 1 year– 1 through the addition of a substrate area equivalent to 100 f the pond surface area...|$|R
40|$|AIM: This {{multicentre}} study analyzed the maternal and fetal outcomes {{of women who}} had one elevated 3 -h oral glucose tolerance test (isolated gestational hyperglycaemia [IGH]). METHODS: From 1999 to 2003, data were collected for 606 IGH women from 31 Italian obstetric or diabetic centres, including time and mode of delivery, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, congenital malformations, and neonatal mortality and morbidity, to compare them with the general pregnant Italian population. A prognostic model for the outcome of pregnancy was constructed, and the concurrence of certain specified conditions was considered a positive outcome, whereas pregnancies that failed to meet {{one or more of}} the stated conditions were classified as "complicated". RESULTS: Macrosomia was significantly more frequent in women with <b>IGH</b> <b>than</b> in the normal pregnant population (10. 7 vs 7. 4 %, respectively; P= 0. 003). Stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates did not differ from those in normal pregnancies, while a slight rise in the frequency of major malformations was not statistically significant (1. 48 vs 0. 89 %, respectively; P< 0. 11). Multivariate logistic analyses confirmed that the prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) was an independent predictor of a complicated pregnancy. As for fetal growth, multivariate logistic analyses according to BMI showed that being overweight or obese were strong predictors of macrosomia. CONCLUSION: These findings in a large cohort of Italian women with IGH confirm the detrimental effect of even minimally altered glucose tolerance on fetal outcome. Also, prepregnancy obesity plays an important role in raising the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes in such patients...|$|R

Some {{of them were}} exposed to air for a period ranging from 1 dayto 2 weeks. X-rayph otoelectron spectroscopy(X PS) revealed a clean copper surface with a trace of oxygen. These films that were exposed to air presented oxides in the state Cu(II), the amount of CuO depended on {{the time that the}} film was exposed to air. Subsequently, we deposited TiO ultra-thin films on polycrystalline copper substrates. Both these thin films were formed bye lectron beam evaporation. XPS spectra showed that the surface of the titanium monoxide (TiO) films was contamination-free. An evaporation of 0. 3 nm of TiO reduced the native oxide of the copper substrates from Cu(II) to Cu(I) or Cu(0) and transformed the TiO into TiO 2 at the interface. Low-energyio n spectroscopy showed that the complete coverage of the substrates depends on the thickness of the copper films. For 10 nm copper thin films the complete coverage occurred at 1. 5 nm of TiO, and for 100 nm it occurred at 2. 0 nm of TiO. In samples exposed to air, the complete coverage occurred at a film thickness slightlyh <b>igher</b> <b>than</b> those treated under ultra-high-vacuum conditions.

40|$|Objective: Several {{studies suggest}} that a fatty meal impairs flow-mediated {{vasodilation}} (FMD), a measur 9 e of endothelial function. We tested whether the impairment was greater for trans fats than for saturated fats. We did this because we previously showed that replacement of saturated fats by trans fats in a controlled diet decreased FMD after 4 weeks. Design: We fed 21 healthy men two different test meals with 0. 9 - 1. 0 g fat/kg body weight in random order: one rich in saturated fatty acids (Sat), mainly from palm kernel fat, and one rich in trans fatty acids (Trans) from partially hydrogenated soy bean oil. The study was performed in our metabolic ward. We had complete data for both diets of 21 men. Results: FMD increased from a fasting value of 2. 3 ± 2. 0 percent of the baseline diameter to 3. 0 ± 1. 7 percent after the Sat test meal (95 percent I for change - 0. 33, 1. 70) and from 2. 7 ± 2. 3 to 3. 1 ± 2. 0 percent after the Trans test meal (95 percent I for change - 0. 57, 1. 29). The increase after the Sat meal was 0. 22 (- 1. 18 - 1. 61) FMD <b>igher</b> <b>than</b> after the Trans meal. Serum triacylglycerols increased by 0. 46 ± 0. 36 mmol/l after the Sat test meal and by 0. 68 ± 0. 59 mmol/l after the Trans test meal; a difference of 0. 23 (0. 07, 0. 39) mmol/l. Serum HDL-cholesterol was hardly affected by the test meals. The activity of serum paraoxonase, an esterase bound to HDL, increased slightly after the two test meals but the difference between meals was not significant. Conclusion: FMD was not impaired and not different after test meals with saturated or trans fatty acids. Thus, differences in long-term effects of these fats are not caused by differences in acute effects on the vascular wal...|$|R

40|$|After {{immunization}} or infection, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates {{diversification of}} immunoglobulin (Ig) genes in B cells, introducing mutations within the antigen-binding V regions (somatic hypermutation, SHM) and double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) into switch (S) regions, leading to antibody class switch recombination (CSR). We asked if, during B cell activation, AID also induces DNA breaks at genes other <b>than</b> <b>IgH</b> genes. Using a nonbiased genome-wide approach, {{we have identified}} hundreds of reproducible, AID-dependent DSBs in mouse splenic B cells shortly after induction of CSR in culture. Most interestingly, AID induces DSBs at sites syntenic with sites of translocations, deletions, and amplifications found in human B cell lymphomas, including within the oncogene B cell lymphoma 11 a (bcl 11 a) /evi 9.

Aims: To study the efficacy of phenol in causing repigmentation in IGH and its adverse effect profile. Settings and Design: Open prospective study.

40|$|Systemic {{monoclonal}} immunoglobulin {{light chain}} amyloidosis (AL) is associated with clonal plasma cell dyscrasias that are often subtle and non-proliferating. AL shares numerical chromosomal changes with multiple myeloma (MM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Illegitimate translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) at 14 q 32 and deletions of the long arm of chromosome 13, [del(13 q) ], commonly occur in MM, MGUS and plasma cell leukaemia. In AL IGH rearrangements have been identified but, to date, there are no reports of del(13 q). In this study of 32 patients with AL, 24 with systemic and eight with localized disease, translocations involving IGH and del(13 q) were found using dual-colour interphase {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). IGH translocations were observed in 11 patients (37 % overall and in 46 % with systemic disease), of which nine had the IGH/CCND 1 fusion from t(11; 14) (q 13;q 32). Two showed <b>IGH</b> translocations other <b>than</b> the t(11; 14) or t(4; 14) (p 16;q 32). In one of these patients a breakpoint within the constant region of IGH between Calpha 1 and Calpha 2 was indicated. In the second a deletion covering Calpha 1 and Calpha 2 accompanied the translocation. Ten patients (27 % overall and 33 % of those with systemic disease) showed del(13 q).
