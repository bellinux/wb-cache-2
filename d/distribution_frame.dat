25|$|A typical {{central office}} may have tens of {{thousands}} of pairs of wires that appear on terminal blocks called the main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF). A component of the MDF is protection: fuses or other devices that protect the switch from lightning, shorts with electric power lines, or other foreign voltages. In a typical telephone company, a large database tracks information about each subscriber pair and the status of each jumper. Before computerization of Bell System records in the 1980s, this information was handwritten in pencil in accounting ledger books.|$|E
50|$|An {{intermediate}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (IDF) is a <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> in {{a central}} office or customer premises, which cross-connects the user cable media to individual user line circuits and {{may serve as a}} distribution point for multipair cables from the main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF) or combined <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (CDF) to individual cables connected to equipment in areas remote from these frames.|$|E

50|$|<b>Distribution</b> <b>frames</b> {{may grow}} to {{extremely}} large sizes. In major installations, audio <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> can {{have as many}} as 10,000 incoming and outgoing separate copper wires (balanced audio signals require two wires plus earth ground for each signal). Telephone signals do not use a separate earth ground wire, but some urban exchanges have about 250,000 wires on their MDF. Installing and rewiring these jumpers is a labour-intensive task, leading to attempts in the industry to devise so-called active <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> or Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frames.</b> The principal issues which {{stand in the way of}} their widespread adoption are cost and reliability.|$|R

50|$|Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame</b> (AMDF), (automated {{switching}} matrix, automated <b>distribution</b> <b>frame,</b> Loop Management System (LMS)), {{a technology}} to provide connectivity between subscriber (local loop, outside plant) - and office equipment (inside plant) lines {{in a telephone}} exchange (central office, CO) main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF).|$|E
5000|$|In telecommunication, a {{combined}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (CDF) is a <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> that combines {{the functions of}} main and intermediate distribution frames and contains both vertical and horizontal terminating blocks.|$|E
50|$|A {{complete}} LMS has {{software and}} hardware components. The latter is usually a switch fabric connected both to all required lines and line equipment at {{either side of a}} line. The functionality is similar to one performed by a Main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> or any other <b>distribution</b> <b>frame,</b> so sometimes is referred to as Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame.</b> A software component implies implementing management operations.|$|E
50|$|Like other <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> the MDF {{provides}} {{flexibility in}} assigning facilities, at lower cost and higher capacity than a patch panel.|$|R
50|$|Split 50 66 blocks {{are still}} used as network {{interface}} blocks in <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> to interconnect circuits with bridging clips, but are primarily limited to narrowband circuits such as POTS/DSL, DS0, or DS1 circuits.|$|R

50|$|An SS7 probe is a {{physical}} device to obtain signalling and/or bearer information from a telecommunications network, such as the PSTN or a corporate telephone system. The probe passively monitors the E1/T1 or SDH/SONET bearers, and extracts the signalling information for onward presentation to a network application. A passive probe {{does not affect the}} network under observation, and this is achieved through use of protected monitor points on the network <b>distribution</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R

50|$|In telephony, a main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF or main frame) is {{a signal}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> for {{connecting}} equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by jumper wires at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to intermediate distribution frames (IDF) terminate at the MDF. Trunk cables may terminate {{on the same}} MDF or on a separate trunk main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (TMDF).|$|E
50|$|The GigaBIX {{system is}} {{primarily}} {{made up of}} mounts and connectors. The Patch Cord topology utilizes GigaBIX PS6+ patch cords which are 4 pair 23-AWG UTP cords with a channel bandwidth of 250 MHz or 300 MHz, depending on how they are employed. These patch cords are typically used with the and the Cross-Connect topology utilizes GigaBIX cross-connect wire. Both topologies utilize the same mounts, connectors, <b>distribution</b> <b>frames,</b> and other accessories (such as designation strips, wire guards, covers, distribution rings, and many other accessories).|$|R
50|$|Forecasters in {{the late}} 1960s underestimated demand, {{resulting}} in a shortage of capacity in Manhattan, NYTel's principal profit area. Customers had to wait weeks for a new line or a repair, and sometimes minutes for dial tone on an existing line. The new 1ESS Stored Program Control exchanges had software bugs that kept them from carrying full load. Deferred maintenance choked main <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> (MDFs) with dead jumpers. There were not enough cables to office buildings, nor enough underground conduits to install them. Morale was poor in all levels and departments; strikes were frequent.|$|R
50|$|A passive optical {{distribution}} network (PON) uses single mode optical fibre {{in the outside}} plant, optical splitters and optical <b>distribution</b> <b>frames,</b> duplexed so that both upstream and downstream signals share the same fibre on separate wavelengths. Faster PON standards generally support a higher split ratio of users per PON, but may also use reach extenders/amplifiers where extra coverage is needed. Optical splitters creating a point to multipoint topology are also the same technology regardless {{of the type of}} PON system, making any PON network upgradable by changing the ONT and OLT terminals at each end, with minimal change to the physical network.|$|R
50|$|In telecommunications, a <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> is {{a passive}} device which terminates cables, {{allowing}} arbitrary interconnections to be made.|$|E
50|$|Secondary {{feeder lines}} run to a streetside cabinet {{containing}} a <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> called a Serving Area Interface (SAI).|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the first}} {{responders}} to the fire were employees of Bell Companies and Western Electric. Five thousand employees collaborated to restore service. A main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> was ordered and shipped to Manhattan for installation. The main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> typically takes six months to install because its massive framework supports {{hundreds of miles of}} wire. Remarkably, it only took them four days to install. Twenty four days later, service was restored entirely.|$|E
50|$|Such {{tools were}} used in large numbers in American {{telephone}} exchanges in {{the last third of}} the 20th century, usually with a bigger bit to handle 22 or 24 AWG wire rather than the smaller 28 or 30 AWG used in circuit boards and backplanes. The larger posts can be rewrapped hundreds of times. They persisted into the 21st century in <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> where insulation-displacement connectors had not taken over entirely. Larger, hand held, high speed electric wrap guns replaced soldering in the late 1960s for permanent wiring, when installing exchange equipment. In the middle 1980s they were gradually replaced by connectorized cables.|$|R
50|$|PON Optical Distribution Networks use {{single mode}} optical fibre {{in the outside}} plant, optical {{splitters}} and optical <b>distribution</b> <b>frames,</b> duplexed so that both upstream and downstream share the same fibre on separate wavelengths. 10G-PON is no exception with similar reach to previous standards but supporting a higher split ratio of 128 users per PON, or more using reach extenders/amplifiers. Optical splitters creating a point to multipoint topology are also the same technology as those used by other PON systems. This means any PON network should be upgradable by changing the ONT and OLT terminals at each end, with no change to the fibre itself unless different connectors are chosen.|$|R
5000|$|In telecommunication, a {{technical}} control facility (TCF) is a telecommunications facility, or a designated and specially configured part thereof, that (a) contains the equipment necessary for ensuring fast, reliable, and secure exchange of information, (b) typically includes <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> and associated panels, jacks, and switches and monitoring, test, conditioning, and orderwire equipment, and (c) allows telecommunications systems control personnel to exercise operational {{control of communications}} paths and facilities, make quality analyses of communications and communications channels, [...] operations and maintenance functions, recognize and correct deteriorating conditions, restore disrupted communications, provide requested on-call circuits, and take or direct such actions as may be required and practical to provide effective telecommunications services.|$|R
