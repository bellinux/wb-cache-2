5|$|No.1 AD's {{strength}} {{increased from}} 350 {{staff in the}} 1930s to over 2,000 during World WarII, when it assembled, tested and repaired aircraft ranging from Tiger Moth trainers to Spitfire <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers. It also undertook aircraft research and development.|$|E
5|$|Up until now, the Bf 109s had {{successfully}} blocked {{attacks on the}} bombers. However, Park's tactics of attacking the Germans all along the route forced their <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> use up fuel more quickly in dogfights. When the outskirts of London came into view, they began to depart at 12:07 north of Lewisham.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qassam {{studied at}} Al-Azhar University in Egypt and {{afterward}} became an Islamic revivalist preacher {{in his hometown}} of Jableh in Syria during the last years of Ottoman rule. Following his return, he became an active supporter of the Libyan resistance to Italian rule, raising funds and <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> aid the Libyans and penning an anthem for them. He would later lead his own group of rebels in alliance with Ibrahim Hananu to fight against French Mandatory forces in northern Syria in 1919–20.|$|E
25|$|During 1931, the USAAC {{ordered the}} Berliner-Joyce YP-16 {{which had the}} {{distinction}} of being the last biplane <b>fighter</b> <b>to</b> enter service with the USAAC. In addition, the P-16 remained the only two-seat biplane <b>fighter</b> <b>to</b> be produced for the army after 1918.|$|R
50|$|On May 30, 2010 Hioki fought Takeshi Inoue for the Shooto Featherweight Championship (143 lbs) and {{won by a}} split {{decision}} making him the 9th <b>fighter</b> <b>to</b> win it and the 8th Japanese <b>fighter</b> <b>to</b> do so. Hioki had a controversially lost to Antonio Carvalho during his Shooto career.|$|R
50|$|Kawanishi's N1K was {{originally}} {{built as a}} single pontoon floatplane <b>fighter</b> <b>to</b> support forward offensive operations where no airstrips were available, but by 1943 when the aircraft entered service, Japan was firmly on the defensive, {{and there was no}} more need for a <b>fighter</b> <b>to</b> fulfil this role.|$|R
5|$|Despite the accident, a {{pre-production}} {{batch of}} ten aircraft was ordered on 27 July 1945 {{as it was}} felt that mixed-power aircraft would be of some use easing the transition of pilots from piston-engine <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> jet-engined ones. At the same time Sukhoi's Su-5 was cancelled as it was judged inferior to the I-250.|$|E
5|$|During 1944–45, the Luftwaffe {{committed}} {{two other}} jet- or rocket-powered <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> combat operations. In {{addition to the}} Me 262, the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet and the Heinkel He 162 Volksjäger both become operational. Few claims were made by pilots of the Me 163 and He 162, and none achieved ace status on either of these types.|$|E
5|$|Galland {{received}} {{a telephone call}} from Göring on 10 May 1941, requesting Galland to intercept a Messerschmitt Bf 110 flown by Rudolf Hess heading for Scotland. Galland was unable to launch a full fighter sweep. However, Hess' flight was far to the north and he reached Scotland crashing his aircraft. Galland sent out <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> conduct some sweeps so he could honestly claim to have carried out his orders but it was nearly dark and Galland ordered his pilots unused to night flying to stand down.|$|E

5|$|In early June 2013 Hezbollah has now {{committed}} <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> {{the battle}} in Aleppo, some 2,000, reportedly putting strain on the organisation. This has resulted in Hezbollah introducing a change to its rotation policy for its fighters from 7 days fighting followed by 7 days leave, Hezbollah has increased it to 20 days fighting and followed by 7 days leave for its fighters.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two main}} engagements, the fighter losses had been about equal. The big {{difference}} was the bombers losses. Fighter Command had had greater success against the afternoon attack rather than the morning assault, which it out numbered 2:1. The ratio of German <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> bombers had been 3:1 in the morning but 5:1 in the afternoon, so there were more targets. The more bombers Kesselring sent, the more were lost.|$|E
5|$|The Mikoyan-Gurevich I-211 was a {{prototype}} high-altitude Soviet fighter aircraft built during World War II. It was {{a version of}} the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-210, itself a variant of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3, fitted with a Shvetsov ASh-82F radial engine. Its development was quite prolonged, although successful, but by the time it finished its manufacturer's trials in early 1944 {{there was no need for}} a high-altitude fighter and it was not worth reducing the production of existing <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> convert a factory over to the I-211.|$|E

5|$|The Sea Harriers {{operated}} from INS Viraat for {{the last}} time on 6 March 2016. On 11 May 2016, a ceremony was held at INS Hansa, Dabolim, Goa to commemorate the phasing out of Sea Harriers from INAS 300 ("White Tigers"). Sea Harriers and MiG 29Ks performed an air display at the ceremony, marking the final flight of the Sea Harriers in the Indian Navy. INAS 300 subsequently introduced MiG 29K/Kub <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> replace the retired Sea Harrier fleet.|$|E
5|$|The {{rich and}} notorious arms and drug trafficker, {{as well as}} a skilled and {{ruthless}} fighter, Rugal Bernstein has become bored with the lack of competition, so he decides to host a new King of Fighters tournament. He has his secretary travel to eight destinations around the world to invite <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> compete in his new tournament. Unlike the previous KOF tournaments depicted in the Fatal Fury series, the new King of Fighters is a team tournament, with eight teams of three, each representing a different nationality.|$|E
5|$|We were {{informed}} of {{the prospect of a}} shortening in food rations. 300 grams of meat or sausage per week. Once the Führer asserted he had the right to require sacrifices because he himself was ready to accept any personal sacrifice. If now the idea came into his head to starve to death, then I would not want to take away his right to ask all his fellow <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> do the same.|$|E

5|$|All four {{receiver}} antennas {{were connected}} via separate {{leads to a}} motorized switch that selected {{each one of the}} inputs in turn, sending it into the amplifier. The output was then switched, using the same system, to one of four inputs into the CRTs. The entire radar dipole aerial setup for the AI Mk.IV was simple in comparison to the 32-dipole Matratze (mattress) transceiving array fitted to the noses of the earliest German night <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> use AI radar, for their own UHF-band Lichtenstein B/C airborne radar design from 1942–43.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, matches involve each player selecting two <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> fight with. Players are able to switch their fighters out at any time, allowing the inactive character to gradually recover some life they might have lost. At certain points, an inactive character's life bar may flash, giving them a temporary boost in strength if they are tagged in. If the life bar of either of a player's fighters runs out, that player loses the round. If time runs out, the player who has the most cumulative life remaining amongst their fighters wins the round.|$|E
5|$|At 09:12, JG 2 {{crossed the}} front line at Malmedy and was greeted by an {{enormous}} volume of Allied ground fire. The entire area was heavily defended by anti-aircraft artillery, since the area had been the scene of heavy fighting, but also had been attacked by V-1 and V-2 missiles. I./JG 2 lost at least seven <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> ground fire alone. III./JG 2 lost 10 fighters. A possible seven Bf 109s from II./JG 2 were also lost to ground fire. JG 2 attacked Asch and Ophoven airfields by mistake.|$|E

5|$|Aviation was not neglected. Plans {{called for}} an air force of 18 flying boats, 18 {{reconnaissance}} fighters, 18 torpedo bombers and 18 single-seat <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> protect them. Royal Air Force airfields were established at RAF Tengah and RAF Sembawang. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Lord Trenchard, argued that 30 torpedo bombers could replace the 15-inch guns. The First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Beatty, did not agree. A compromise was reached whereby the guns would be installed, but the issue was reconsidered when better torpedo planes became available. Test firings of 15-inch and 9.2-inch guns at Malta and Portsmouth in 1926 indicated that greatly improved shells were required if the guns were {{to have a chance}} of hitting a battleship.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1943, {{following}} {{the capture of}} southern Italy, Allied aircraft started to appear over the Balkans. NDH military command was aware of this danger {{and was trying to}} persuade the Germans to provide at least two squadrons of Messerschmitt Bf 109 <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> the ZNDH. However, instead of Bf 109s, the only reinforcement fighters that came from Germany were the first of a batch of 36 overhauled captured French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters in October, plus another dozen which arrived in December. The Germans also supplied 25 Beneš-Mráz Beta-Minor sporting two seater monoplanes, which were dispatched between the squadrons for liaison duty, as the lack of radio communications equipment at squadron level was still evident.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to emphasise good {{relations}} with the white settlers, in August 1963 Kenyatta met with 300 white farmers at Nakuru. He reassured them that they would be safe and welcome in an independent Kenya, and more broadly talked of forgiving and forgetting the conflicts of the past. Despite his attempts at wooing white support, he did not do the same with the Indian minority. Like many indigenous Africans in Kenya, Kenyatta bore a sense of resentment towards this community, despite the role that many Indians had played in securing the country's independence. He also encouraged the remaining Mau Mau <b>fighters</b> <b>to</b> leave the forests and settle in society. However, throughout Kenyatta's rule, many of these individuals would remain unemployed, with unemployment being one of the most persistent problems facing his government.|$|E
