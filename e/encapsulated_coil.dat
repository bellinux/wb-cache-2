These shim coil currents are adjusted manually by an operator to achieve a homoge-neous magnetic field. Visualizing magnetic field will assist operator in optimal shimming. A novel method to visualize NMR Magnetic field is presented. The prob-lem poses challenges that are different from computationally intensive general magnetic field computation and visualization.

Various kinds of functional microgels can only stabilize an oil-in-water Pickering emulsion, and it is thus difficult to encapsulate cells in the emulsion where the cells are usually dispersed in the continuous phase. Herein, we introduce a facile method for preparing cell-embedded colloidosomes in an oil-in-water emulsion via polyelectrolyte complexation. Escherichia coli (E. coli) was chosen as a model cell and embedded in the thin shell of chitosan/poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (P(NIPAM-co-AAc)) microcapsules. This is beneficial for expressing cell function because of the little resistance of mass exchange between the embedded cells and the external environment. Cells {{can be used in}} biocatalysis or biomedicine and our product will hold great promises to improve the performance in those fields. The synthesis route presents a platform to prepare cell-embedded microcapsules in an oil-in-water Pickering emulsion in a facile and biocompatible way. First, an emulsion stabilized by P(NIPAM-co-AAc) microgels was prepared. Then, the interfacial microgels in the emulsion were locked by chitosan to form colloidosomes. The mechanism of cell encapsulation in this system was studied via fluorescent labeling. The viability of E. coli after encapsulation is ca. 90 %. <b>Encapsulated</b> E. <b>coil</b> is able to metabolize glucose from solution, and exhibits a slower rate than free E. coil. This demonstrates a diffusion constraint through the colloidosome shell...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the design and implementation of an Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) intended for high temperature ultrasonic applications; which benefits from a novel approach using a pulsed current electromagnet (PE) and a ceramic <b>encapsulated</b> spaced spiral <b>coil,</b> both designed to operate at elevated temperatures without any active cooling. In detail all the steps taken towards the development of the PE-EMAT and its supporting electronics are presented here, together with the finite element simulations performed for the electromagnetic and ultrasonic analysis; which includes: the computation of the flux density produced by the electromagnet and its variation with lift-off (gap between core and metallic sample), the calculation and visualisation of the magnitude of the current density induced by an alternating current flowing in two different EMAT coil designs in non-magnetic and magnetic samples; as well as the validation of the propagation of the ultrasonic wave generated/detected by the PE-EMAT. The experimental results regarding the performance of the PE-EMAT are also presented. Firstly, the performance at room temperature to show the shear wave generation in paramagnatic and ferromagnetic samples, the effect of the presence of an oxide layer adhered to the sample, and the lift-off performance. Secondly, the performance at a range of different temperatures to demonstrate that the PE-EMAT has been employed successfully at temperatures up to 600 oC, without using any active cooling system, and that is capable of performing ultrasonic measurements of sample thickness and material properties, without the use of any sort of couplant, nor the necessity of sample preparation...|$|R

A microfabrication process flow was designed using 15 optical masks and 110 process steps to fabricate the micro-turbo-generators, which demonstrates the complexity in device manufacturing. Two 10 pole devices with 2 and 3 turns per pole were fabricated. Single phase resistances of 46 &# 8486; and 220 &# 8486; were measured for the two stators, respectively. The device was actuated using pressurized nitrogen flowing through a silicon plumbing layer. A test setup was built to simultaneously measure the gas flow rate, pressure, rotor speed, and output voltage and power. Friction torques in the range of 5. 5 - 33 µNm were measured over a speed range of 0 - 16 krpm (kilo rotations per minute) within the microball bearings using spin-down testing methodology. A maximum per-phase sinusoidal open circuit voltage of 0. 1 V was measured at 23 krpm, and a maximum per-phase AC power of 10 µW was delivered on a matched load at 10 krpm, which are in full-agreement with the estimations based on theoretical analysis and simulations. The micro-turbo-generator presented in this work is capable of converting gas flow into electricity, and can potentially be coupled to a same-scale combustion engine to convert high-density hydrocarbon energy into electrical power to realize a high-density power source for portable electronic systems...|$|R
