The role has since been replicated in many Commonwealth and foreign countries.|$|E
40|$|At {{the start}} of a wider project with a {{regional}} group of secondary schools, we asked the core subject departments of English, Mathematics and Science {{to talk to us about}} examples, grounded in their own classroom experience, of what they regarded as successful use of ICT to support teaching and learning. From this evidence base we built a model identifying and organising the main ideas expressed by teachers. We think that such a model is of interest because it indicates the concerns of practitioners and captures an aspect of their expertise, refined through their accumulated experience in a range of school conditions. Here we will offer an overview of the model, focusing on the ideas expressed by Mathematics departments. A much fuller report dealing with all three subjects is available (Ruthven, Hennessy & Brindley, submitted), as well as the report of an earlier pilot analysis focusing specifically on Mathematics (Ruthven & Hennessy, 2002). Across the core subjects, several major themes emerged from the <b>departmental</b> <b>accounts</b> of successful computer use. Each points to important ways in which teachers considered that the use of ICT tools and resources could support teaching and learning. Effecting working processes and improving production Teachers pointed to ways in which use of ICT could expedite and – more broadly – facilitate th...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{development}} and diffusion of accounting techniques in UK hospitals and finds that attempts to utilise accounting data, for performance measurement and control, predate {{the introduction of the}} NHS in 1948. The main focus of the paper is the move from the uniform system of accounts, first introduced in 1893, to <b>departmental</b> <b>accounting</b> information in 1956. After identifying the antecedent accounting conditions the paper explores both why and how change occurred by analysing the roles of dominant individuals, institutions, political and economic forces that led to the introduction of <b>departmental</b> <b>accounting.</b> The process of change, after the nationalisation of the hospitals in 1948, {{had a significant impact on}} the accounting technology adopted: with departmental budgeting being dropped. Finally, the role of the medical profession in the departmentalisation debate is explored and possible explanations for the reluctance to adopt new management accounting techniques are discussed. hospital accounting, uniform accounts, voluntary, department, costing, budgets,...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} couple of years, the Commonwealth and the almost all State governments have put their annual budgets and <b>departmental</b> <b>{{accounting}}</b> on an accrual basis. Accrual accounting has, as a consequence, almost entirely replaced traditional 'cash'accounting in the Australian public sector. This is a great step forward. Accrual accounting has great advantages, particularly in the fiscal policy context. Notwithstanding the advantages of accrual accounting, it has to be frankly acknowledged that insofar as the move to accrual accounting was 'sold' on the basis of improved fiscal transparency, it has failed. Ministers, parliamentarians and other lay uses would appear to be very much confused by the new accrual-based Budget Papers. So even are many trained economists. This paper aims to do a number of things. Firstly, it outlines the elements of accrual fiscal measures, including the Commonwealth's new 'fiscal balance' measure. Secondly, it presents a view as to the key benefits of adopting accrual accounting in government. Thirdly, it points to some of the key reasons why the Budget Papers and other government financial reports have become unnecessarily confusing, and suggests some solutions...|$|R
40|$|This {{guideline}} {{establishes the}} requirements for determining the allowability of direct and indirect costs on the financial accounting records of the University in accordance with Federal regulations. This guideline also establishes {{the responsibility of the}} Principal Investigator (PI), the Department Chair and the Departmental Administrator to ensure the allowability of the direct and indirect costs recorded on their sponsored projects and <b>departmental</b> <b>accounts.</b> Finally, this guideline establishes the responsibility of the Director of Research/Cost Accounting to provide departmental support on cost allowability issues related to OMB Circular A- 21, and to perform periodic reviews to ensure compliance and integrity of the University’s accounting records for grants and contracts. The University’s guideline on allowability of direct and indirect costs applies to all faculty and staff who record costs on the accounting records of the University. It also applies to all sources of University funding including unrestricted, restricted, endowment and plant funds. II. Guideline The total costs of a sponsored agreement are comprised of the allowable direct costs integral to the performance of the agreement, plus the allocable portion of the allowable indirect costs of the institution. It is the University’s responsibility, not the responsibility of the Federal agency or other sponsor, to ensure that costs budgeted and charged to a sponsored agreement are allowable, allocable and reasonable. In summary, costs are allowable on sponsored projects if the costs are...|$|E
40|$|This article {{contributes}} to an emerging field of ‘small data’ research on Twitter by presenting {{a case study}} of how teachers and students at a sixth-form college in the north of England used this social media platform to help construct a ‘community of practice’ that enabled micro-processes of recognition and mutual learning. Conducted {{as part of a broader}} action research project that focused on the ‘digital story circle’ as a site of, and for, narrative exchange and knowledge production, this study takes the form of a detailed analysis of a <b>departmental</b> Twitter <b>account,</b> combining basic quantitative metrics, close reading of selected Twitter data and qualitative interviews with teachers and students. Working with (and sometimes against) Twitter's platform architecture, teachers and students constructed, through distinct patterns of use, a shared space for dialogue that facilitated community building within the department. On the whole, they were able to overcome justified anxieties about professionalism and privacy; this was achieved by building on high levels of pre-existing trust among staff and by performing that mutual trust online through personal modes of communication. Through micro-processes of recognition and a breaking down of conventional hierarchies that affirmed students' agency as knowledge producers, the <b>departmental</b> Twitter <b>account</b> enabled mutual learning beyond curriculum and classroom. The significance of such micro-processes could only have been uncovered through the detailed scrutiny that a ‘small data’ approach to Twitter, in supplement to some obvious virtues of Big Data approaches, is particularly well placed to provide...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying foreign {{exchange}} risk within military acquisition presents the Department of National Defence (DND) with a nontrivial budget problem. Industry has accepted standard financial reporting methods that center on value-at-risk (VaR), which provide a quantitative measure on the downside risk associated with foreign currency transactions. We construct a model designed to forecast DND’s {{foreign exchange}} expenditures within <b>departmental</b> financial <b>accounts</b> and to capture the effect of time-varying volatility on DND’s foreign exchange transaction risk. Our resulting VaR model yields the maximum expected loss from adverse currency fluctuations over a budget horizon. Finally, we show that DND can mitigate its {{foreign exchange risk}} by applying simpl...|$|R
40|$|Government {{accounting}} {{reform has}} in certain industrialised countries become a recognisable component of market-oriented New Public Management reforms. A key dimension is {{the conversion of}} accounting from the traditional cash basis to accruals, usually anchored in GAAP as developed for that country's private sector. Taking the UK proposals for Resource Accounting and Budgeting, this paper shows that issues concerning consolidation are proving both important and troublesome. After reviewing private sector experience with consolidation, the structure of UK central government is carefully mapped. The limited area for consolidation proposed by the UK Treasury {{as the basis for}} constructing <b>Departmental</b> Resource <b>Accounts</b> is criticised. Attention is paid to the complex structure of public service delivery, with much of that now done by quasi-public organisations outside both the proposed departmental boundary and the national accounts aggregate of general government. This paper does not examine the related topic of Whole-of-Government Accounts...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. This thesis examines the requirements {{and design of}} a financial management system for the academic departments at the Naval Postgraduate School. Existing systems are difficult to maintain and/or provide out-of-date information. A system is needed that is easy to use, easy to maintain, and provides current account status information so that the academic departments can make intelligent financial decisions. We examined existing methods and tools for designing and building client/server applications. After comparing the traditional waterfall approach to the rapid prototyping approach, we elected to use rapid prototyping {{in order to develop}} the system quickly and to help the users determine their own requirements. We decided to use the Powersoft Portfolio tool set from Powersoft Corporation because it is scalable, transportable, affordable, and compliant with the Open Database Connectivity standard. The result of this thesis is a prototype financial management system that users have found easy to use and maintain. The system provides summary and detail information on <b>departmental</b> financial <b>accounts,</b> to include balances and expenditures in the funding categories of faculty and support labor, equipment, travel, and contracts[URL] Naval Postgraduate Schoo...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} a {{long process}} of {{transition}} from cash accounting, UK central government departments discharged their public accountability in 2001 – 02 by presenting <b>Departmental</b> Resource <b>Accounts</b> (DRAs) to Parliament. This article assesses the implementation of Resource Accounting, focusing on timeliness (measured by certification lags) and accounts quality (measured by the property of not being qualified). The descriptive statistics indicate substantial variation in certification lag. The estimated OLS regression model has strong explanatory power. Explanatory variables include those that can be regarded as enduring and those that are attributable to the transition process. The enduring variables are: new DRA, consolidation, audit qualification and pension scheme (whose statistically significant positive coefficients show that these are associated with longer certification lags) and percentage of Appropriations-in-Aid (statistically significant negative coefficient). The transitional variables are Executive Agency and a dummy for 2001 – 02 (whose statistically significant negative coefficients show that these are associated with shorter certification lags). Potential for shorter certification lags is identified, as are administrative deficiencies that delay the arrival of some certified DRAs into the public domain. Accounts quality improved during the transition period, though problems still occur in some departments that are important in terms of expenditure and assets...|$|R
40|$|The Department {{established}} the Working Capital Fund (Fund) in January 1996 {{as a financial}} management tool for charging the costs of common services provided at Headquarters to Departmental program offices. Prior to establishing the Fund, the Office of Human Resources and Administration (HR) paid most {{of the costs of}} these services from the <b>Departmental</b> Administration <b>account</b> without attempting to allocate the costs back of the programs using the services. Since the Fund`s implementation, Department program offices have made periodic advance payments to the Fund from their program direction accounts and are then charged for the services they consume. The Department`s objectives in establishing the Fund were to increase efficiency of the Department`s operations, improve management of administrative services through the use of flexible and business-like finance methods, and provide an accurate full cost budget for programs and activities. The costs of the services administered by the Fund are expected to total about $ 80 million in Fiscal Year 1998, which excludes Federal salaries and some other indirect charges incurred by HR. Although the Fund is making progress in meeting its objectives, additional management attention could result in further cost reductions to the Department. Despite these achievements, the author identified three areas that require additional management attention to facilitate further cost reductions in the Department`s operations. First, HR incurred a disproportionate share of the Fund`s costs. Second, the operation of the Department`s supply business has posed persistent financial and management problems. The Board had not developed procedures to assess whether Fund business lines are competitive with outside vendors, correct inefficient operations, and shut down those unable to compete. Third, the Fund`s financial management system (FMS) did not efficiently provide timely and accurate information. Management concurred with the findings and recommendations and agreed to take corrective actions...|$|R
40|$|The rise of {{neoliberal}} discourses in {{the public}} sector has resulted in increased performance management of English universities’ research activities. This trend is embodied in the Research Excellence Framework which represents a national-level tool for measuring research quality and determining the funding allocated to individual university research units. The task of implementing university policies and strategies mirroring these national developments lie in the hands of heads of departments (HoDs) who are positioned between senior managers above and academic colleagues below them. Such circumstances signal that HoDs may find themselves in conflicted situations: they are required to embrace nationally- and institutionally-imposed performance management discourses while simultaneously taking into <b>account</b> <b>departmental,</b> faculty, disciplinary, as well as their personal values. This suggests that in constructing themselves as academic managers, HoDs are engaged in intense identity work. Assuming that identity is constructed through an interplay between structural orders and an individual’s agency, this paper suggests that identity is an appealing concept for the study of how individuals’ identities are shaped by and shape the often conflicting discourses in which they are embedded. Drawing on ethnographic research based on shadowing three HoDs at an English university and interviewing almost 40 of their colleagues over a period of six months, the study suggests that in responding to national and institutional pressures, HoDs are engaged in a complex discursive interplay: HoDs’ attitudes towards performance management discourses are not easily interpreted as either symbiotic or hostile but are instead dependent on local and personal circumstances...|$|R
