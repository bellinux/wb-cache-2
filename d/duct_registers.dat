40|$|Testing for duct leakage {{was done}} in 155 homes. Tracer gas tests found that {{infiltration}} rates were three times greater when the air handler was operating than when it was off. Infiltration averaged 0. 85 {{air changes per hour}} (ach) with the air handler (AH) operating continuously and 0. 29 ach with the AH off. Return leaks were found to average 10. 3 % of AH total flow. House airtightness, in 90 of these homes, determined by blower door testing, averaged 12. 58 air changes per hour at 50 Pascals (ACHSO). When the <b>duct</b> <b>registers</b> were sealed, ACHSO decreased to 11. 04, indicating that 12. 2 % of the house leaks were in the duct system. Duct leaks have a dramatic impact upon peak electrical demand. Based on theoretical analysis, a fifteen percent return leak from the attic can increase cooling electrical demand by 100 %. Duct repairs in a typical. electrically heated Florida home reduce winter peak demand by about 1. 6 kW per house at about one-sixth the cost of building new electrical generation capacity...|$|E
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1890, a new cooling system was installed, with an {{electric-powered}} Sturtevant blower forcing 20,000 cubic feet of air a minute over two tons of ice in a basement tank, and then through <b>ducts</b> to <b>registers</b> under the main-floor aisles. Wall fans circulated the air. A huge sponge, saturated with perfume, was placed {{at the mouth of}} the principal air duct.|$|R
5000|$|Also of {{particular}} note, {{is that this}} station was equipped with what {{is believed to be}} the first indoor flush toilet in Delaware County, and central heating, with a common coal fired furnace in the basement with <b>duct</b> work and <b>registers</b> to transport hot air to the Ticket Agent's Office & Waiting Room upstairs. This [...] "modern convenience" [...] eliminated the ever-popular [...] "potbelly" [...] stove ever so present and common in railroad stations across the country.|$|R
50|$|Ducts, {{especially}} in homes, must often allow air to travel vertically within relatively thin walls. These vertical ducts are called stacks and are formed with either very wide and relatively thin rectangular sections or oval sections. At {{the bottom of}} the stack, a stack boot provides a transition from an ordinary large round or rectangular duct to the thin wall-mounted duct. At the top, a stack head can provide a transition back to ordinary <b>ducting</b> while a <b>register</b> head allows the transition to a wall-mounted air register.|$|R
40|$|Passenger compartment's {{interior}} noise and thermal performance are essential {{criteria for the}} driving comfort of vehicles. The air-conditioning system influences both field of comfort. It creates comfortable thermal conditions. On the other hand, the noise radiation of the air-condition system's components can be annoying. The blower, the air distribution <b>ducts</b> and the <b>registers</b> affect air rush noise. In some cases, the refrigerant flow creates hissing noise. Such noise has a great influence on vehicle acoustical comfort and on overall quality perception of a vehicle Therefore, the acoustic performance of air-condition compressors become more important for passenger comfort. At engine idling and at extreme temperatures the air-condition compressor can be audible as the significant sound source. However, {{the aim of this}} paper is to quantify air-borne noise characteristics of vehicle air-condition compressor. A simulated experimental model comprises a small wooden box with dimensions of 0. 5 x 0. 5 x 0. 5 m represented the principle of hemi-anechoic room was designed and acoustic characteristics of the sound field inside the box were determined. The air-condition compressor characteristics parameters considered in this paper are fan position and electric motor speed. In addition, a single number of the air column natural frequency is calculated. The results indicate that significant information can be obtained in order to investigate the vehicle air-condition compressor and consequently improve the vehicle interior quietness...|$|R
40|$|Forced air {{distribution}} systems {{can have a}} significant impact on the energy consumed in residences. It is common practice in U. S. residential buildings to place such duct systems outside the conditioned space. This results in the loss of energy by leakage and conduction to the surroundings. In order to estimate the magnitudes of these losses, 24 houses in the Sacramento, California, area were tested before and after duct retrofitting. The systems in these houses included conventional air conditioning, gas furnaces, electric furnaces and heat pumps. The retrofits consisted of sealing and insulating the duct systems. The field testing consisted of the following measurements: leakage of the house envelopes and their ductwork, flow through individual <b>registers,</b> <b>duct</b> air temperatures, ambient temperatures, surface areas of ducts, and HVAC equipment energy consumption. These data were used to calculate distribution system delivery efficiency as well as the overall efficiency of the distribution system including all interactions with building load and HVAC equipment. Analysis of the test results indicate an average increase in delivery efficiency from 64 % to 76 % and a corresponding average decrease in HVAC energy use of 18 %. This paper summarizes the pre- and post-retrofit efficiency measurements to evaluate the retrofit effectiveness, and includes cost estimates for the duct retrofits. The impacts of leak sealing and insulating will be examined separately. 8 refs., 1 fig., 4 tabs...|$|R
40|$|Closing {{registers}} in {{forced air}} heating systems and leaving some rooms {{in a house}} unconditioned has been suggested {{as a method of}} quickly saving energy for California consumers. This study combined laboratory measurements of the changes in <b>duct</b> leakage as <b>registers</b> are closed together with modeling techniques to estimate the changes in energy use attributed to closing registers. The results of this study showed that register closing led to increased energy use for a typical California house over a wide combination of climate, duct leakage and number of closed registers. The reduction in building thermal loads due to conditioning only a part of the house was offset by increased duct system losses; mostly due to increased duct leakage. Therefore, the register closing technique is not recommended as a viable energy saving strategy for California houses with ducts located outside conditioned space. The energy penalty associated with the register closing technique was found to be minimized if registers furthest from the air handler are closed first because this tends to only affect the pressures and air leakage for the closed off branch. Closing registers nearer the air handler tends to increase the pressures and air leakage for the whole system. Closing too many registers (more than 60 %) is not recommended because the added flow resistance severely restricts the air flow though the system leading to safety concerns. For example, furnaces may operate on the high-limit switch and cooling systems may suffer from frozen coils...|$|R
