5|$|Unprecedented {{security}} measures {{were made by}} the Turkish government to safeguard the NATO summit from terrorist attacks. They especially feared a repetition of the Istanbul bombings of 2003 that killed more than 60 people. Their fear was proven by the arrest of 16 people in Bursa in early May on suspicion of planning to bomb the summit. Police seized guns, explosives, bomb-making booklets and 4,000 compact discs with training advice from Osama Bin Laden, and believed that the suspects were members of the radical <b>Islamic</b> <b>group</b> Ansar al-Islam, thought to be linked with al-Qaeda. On June 24 two bombs also exploded. One bomb went off in a bus in Istanbul killing 4 people (including the bomber), the other outside a hotel in Ankara where US president George W. Bush would be staying. Additionally, on June 25, explosives were found in a parked car at Istanbul's main airport.|$|E

50|$|The Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP) was one {{of several}} similar <b>Islamic</b> {{opposition}} <b>groups,</b> including the <b>Islamic</b> Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), which also fought against the Tajik government in the civil war. The IRP had its origins in underground <b>Islamic</b> <b>groups</b> in the Soviet Union. It was formed in 1990 in Astrakhan by a group consisting mostly of Tatar intellectuals, with separate branches for each Soviet republic. It was in fact registered as an official political party in Russia, but was banned by the Central Asian communist governments. Partly {{as a result of this}} oppression, political opposition erupted into the violence of the civil war in Tajikistan, in which over 50,000 people were killed out of a population of 6 million and another 250,000 fled the country to Afghanistan, Uzbekistan or elsewhere. Following the civil war, the Tajik government incorporated <b>Islamic</b> <b>groups</b> into the government in order to prevent future tensions. However, the other Central Asian republics did not follow this example, continuing instead to repress and persecute <b>Islamic</b> <b>groups</b> rather than allow them to participate in the political process.|$|R
