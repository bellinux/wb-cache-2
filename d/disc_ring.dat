The analysis of our medium-resolution spectroscopy in the near-IR (0. 9 - 2. 35 um), collected in 2012 at the Large Binocular Telescope with the IR spectrograph LUCIFER, allows us to infer the main stellar parameters (visual extinction, accretion luminosity, mass accretion and ejection rates), and model the inner disc, jet, and wind. The NIR spectrum displays several strong emission lines associated with accretion/ejection activity and circumstellar environment. Our analysis shows that the brightness of PV Cep is fading, {{as well as the}} mass accretion rate (2 x 10 ^- 7 Msun/yr^- 1 in 2012 vs ~ 5 x 10 ^- 6 Msun/yr^- 1 in 2004), which is more than one order of magnitude lower than in the outburst phase. Among the several emission lines, only the [FeII] intensity increased after the outburst. The observed [FeII] emission delineates blue- and red-shifted lobes, both with high- and low-velocity components, which trace an asymmetric jet and wind, respectively. The observed emission in the jet has a dynamical age of ~ 8 years, indicating that it was produced during the last outburst. The mass ejection rate in both lobes is 1. 5 x 10 ^- 7 Msun/yr^- 1, approximately matching the high accretion rate observed during and immediately after the outburst. The observed jet/outflow asymmetries are consistent with an inhomogeneous medium.

Young stellar objects (YSOs) occasionally experience enhanced accretion events, the nature of which is still poorly understood. The discovery of various embedded outbursting YSOs has recently questioned the classical definition of EXors and FUors. Aims. We present a detailed spectroscopic investigation of the young eruptive star PV[*]Cep, to improve our understanding of its nature and characterise its circumstellar environment after its last outburst in 2004. Methods. The analysis of our medium-resolution spectroscopy in the near-infrared (NIR, 0. 9 – 2. 35 μm), collected in 2012 at the Large Binocular Telescope with the IR spectrograph LUCIFER, allows us to infer the main stellar parameters (visual extinction, accretion luminosity, mass accretion and ejection rates), and model the inner disc, jet, and wind. Results. The NIR spectrum displays several strong emission lines associated with accretion/ejection activity and circumstellar environment. Our analysis shows that the brightness of PV[*]Cep is fading, {{as well as the}} mass accretion rate (2  ×  10 - 7 [*]M⊙[*]yr- 1 in 2012 vs. ~ 5  ×  10 - 6 [*]M⊙[*]yr- 1 in 2004), which is more than one order of magnitude lower than in the outburst phase. Among the several emission lines, only the [Fe II] intensity increased after the outburst. The observed [Fe[*]II] emission delineates blue- and red-shifted lobes, both with high- and low-velocity components, which trace an asymmetric jet and wind, respectively. The observed emission in the jet has a dynamical age of 7 – 8 years, indicating that it was produced during the last outburst. The visual extinction decreases moving from the red-shifted (AV(red) = 10. 1 ± 0. 7 [*]mag) to the blue-shifted lobe (AV(blue) = 6. 5 ± 0. 4 [*]mag). We measure an average electron temperature of 17 [*] 500 [*]K and electron densities of 30 [*] 000 [*]cm- 3 and 15 [*] 000 [*]cm- 3 for the blue and the red lobe, respectively. The mass ejection rate in both lobes is ~ 1. 5  ×  10 - 7 [*]M⊙[*]yr- 1, approximately matching the high accretion rate observed during and immediately after the outburst (Ṁout/Ṁacc ~  0. 05 – 0. 1). The observed jet/outflow asymmetries are consistent with an inhomogeneous medium.

40|$|Electrochemists have {{at their}} disposal, {{for the study}} of photo- {{electrochemical}} systems, a range of sensors and devices such as rotating optical <b>disc</b> <b>ring</b> electrodes, optically transparent electrodes and optically transparent thin layer electrodes. A microelectrode is an electrode with at least one of its characteristic dimensions of less than 50 pm. This provides a number of advantages to such devices used in analytical techniques: it allows access to hitherto inaccessible media, the low current associated allows for a low analyte consumption and ohmic polarisation, it also renders possible the detection of short-lived species. Based on a thin ring microelectrode design and using the electrode shank as a light guide, the Micro- Optical Ring Electrode (MORE) is a novel device that has been designed and constructed to permit electrochemical investigation of photochemically generated solution species. Thin rings exhibit high rates of material flux to the electrode surface, facilitating the detection of short lived- photo-generated solution intermediates. To exploit this advantage, we have prepared MOREs with ring inner radius to ring outer radius ratios in excess of 0. 999. Electrode behaviour in the dark has been characterised by the use of ferricyanide in conjunction with predictive mathematical models of the time dependence of the current at micro ring electrodes in the dark. Further device improvement has involved the design and construction of a more robust light guide-to-electrode coupling. The resultant increase in the transmitted light intensity and its reproducibility have facilitated the study of the spectral dependence of the photocurrents observed from photo- electro- active systems as well as their correlations to the concentrations of both the photo- active species and the quencher. By exploiting the properties of discontinuous integrals of Bessel Functions, a mathematical model of the behaviour Of the device has been developed allowing for the generation of asymptotic analytical expressions describing: (I) The distribution of the photoexcited analyte over the electrode surface; (ii) The tong illumination time (steady state) photocurrent as a function of electrode dimensions, light intensity and lifetime of the photogenerated species; and (iii) The time dependence of the tight-on photocurrent transient as a function of species lifetime. These expressions can be used to describe and explain the form of the Ru(II) /Fe(III) data described above and, coupled to the analyte-specific use afforded by the light selectivity of the device, make the MORE a powerful analytical tool capable of potentially calibrationless use. The spectral dependence of the photocurrent at the MORE has been investigated and found to correspond to the singlet-to-singlet, metal-to-ligand charge transfer band of the UV-Visible spectrum of ruthenium(II) 2, 2 '-trisbipyridine complex. The value of the Stern-Volmer constant for the quenching of photoexcited Ru(bipy) 3 2 by Fe 3 obtained at the MORE (0. 358 m 3 mor 1) compares favourably with the value obtained from fluorescence measurements (0. 9 m 3 mol' [Un, 1976]). The photochemistry of organic dyes is a very important field especially in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the production of singlet oxygen, with application ranging from pollution remediation processes to photodynamic therapy (PDT), an advanced cancer treatment. Singlet oxygen can be produced by photoexcitation of an organic molecule whose excess energy may then be passed on to a neighbouring oxygen molecule that is forced into its highly reactive singlet state. Effectiveness of singlet oxygen production is usually measured either by the phosphorescence of singlet oxygen at 1270 nm or by use of singlet oxygen traps. Both these methods have limitations, especially in vivcr therefore we wish to extend the applications of the MORE to direct electrochemical singlet oxygen detection. To this end, we have investigated the photo-electrochemical properties of a singlet oxygen precursor: rose bengal (RB). The dark electrochemistry of RB was investigated using the Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance and the Rotating Ring Disc Electrode. We have identified all electrochemical processes associated with rose bengal, and attempted the detection of photoexcited rose bengal in both anaerobic conditions, as well as direct detection of singlet oxygen...|$|E

La madera de teca (Tectona grandis L. f.) es una de las más valiosas en el comercio internacional y una especie importante para la silvicultura tropical. La teca se encuentra en la isla de Timor Leste, pero no existe información disponible sobre su crecimiento en esta región. Se estudió una plantación pura no manejada que fue establecida entre 1940 y 1950 en el Norte de Timor Leste. Entre Octubre- Noviembre 2003 se cosecharon 15 árboles y al tronco se les extrajeron discos a tres niveles de altura (1. 7 m, 9. 5 m y 18. 7 m), y se recolectaron núcleos a la altura del pecho (DAP). El conteo y la medición de los anillos se realizaron mediante el software de análisis de imagen. La distinción entre el duramen y la albura se realizó macroscópicamente por la diferencia de color, y se midieron el radio del duramen y el ancho de la albura. Para cada disco se estudió la relación entre el tallo y radio del duramen y el porcentaje del duramen. Las curvas de variación del ancho de los anillos se presentan para las diferentes posiciones axiales dentro del tronco y se analizó la variabilidad del ancho de los anillos. Las tasas de crecimiento fueron calculadas y las relaciones de radio con la edad se calcularon usando las curvas de crecimiento acumulado. Los anillos de crecimiento eran grandes y bien definidos en la fase juvenil, lo que refleja el carácter de crecimiento rápido de esta especie. La variación en la anchura de los anillos año a año mostró un patrón similar entre los árboles. La anchura media del anillo osciló entre 4. 3 - 7. 3 mm para los primeros 20 años y 3. 3 - 5. 1 mm para los de 30 a 45 años. La excentricidad de la médula fue evidente en la parte inferior del tallo y se observó la formación de anillos sobrepuestos. En promedio, el duramen representó el 84 % del radio y la albura mostró entre 6 y 11 anillos.

In front of these flashing lights is a motor-driven, translucent printed <b>disc</b> with <b>rings</b> of alternating transparent and opaque sectors.|$|R

Under axial symmetry, the potential is classically found from a two-dimensional integral over the body's meridional cross-section. Because it involves an improper integral, high accuracy is generally difficult to reach. We have discovered that, for homogeneous bodies, the singular Green kernel can be converted into a regular kernel by direct analytical integration. This new kernel, easily managed with standard techniques, opens interesting horizons, not only for numerical calculus but also to generate approximations, in particular for geometrically thin <b>discs</b> and <b>rings...</b>|$|R

The proposed method is generalized to be suitable for analyzing such microstrip antennas of various geometries, namely, the rectangular, circular <b>disc,</b> annular <b>ring</b> and triangular patches. The closed form expressions for the resonant frequency, for any mode of operation, involve simple calculations yielding results which agree well with the experimental values. This unique method solves the long-standing problem of analyzing multilayer stacked microstrip antennas of various geometries with ease...|$|R
