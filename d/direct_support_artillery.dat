50|$|First Lieutenant Robinson's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:He was a {{field artillery}} forward observer attached to Company A, 253d Infantry, near Untergriesheim, Germany, on 6 April 1945. Eight hours of desperate fighting over open terrain swept by German machinegun, mortar, and small-arms fire had decimated Company A, robbing it of its commanding officer {{and most of}} its key enlisted personnel when 1st Lt. Robinson rallied the 23 remaining uninjured riflemen and a few walking wounded, and, while carrying his heavy radio for communication with American batteries, led them through intense fire in a charge against the objective. Ten German infantrymen in foxholes threatened to stop the assault, but the gallant leader killed them all at point-blank range with rifle and pistol fire and then pressed on with his men to sweep the area of all resistance. Soon afterward he was ordered to seize the defended town of Kressbach. He went to each of the 19 exhausted survivors with cheering words, instilling in them courage and fortitude, before leading the little band forward once more. In the advance he was seriously wounded in the throat by a shell fragment, but, despite great pain and loss of blood, he refused medical attention and continued the attack, <b>directing</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>artillery</b> fire even though he was mortally wounded. Only after the town had been taken and he could no longer speak did he leave the command he had inspired in victory and walk nearly 2 miles to an aid station where he died from his wound. By his intrepid leadership 1st Lt. Robinson was directly responsible for Company A's accomplishing its mission against tremendous odds.|$|R
50|$|On 5 August 2006 3-7 FA {{deployed}} from Schofield Barracks, Hawaii to the Province of Kirkuk {{in support}} of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The unit conducted a traditional counter-fire mission and {{also served as a}} maneuver taskforce conducting infantry-type missions. The use of 3-7 FA as a maneuver asset instead of a <b>direct</b> <b>support</b> field <b>artillery</b> battalion was a result of the implementation of the counter insurgency (COIN) doctrine in Iraq. The method of removing the insurgency and strengthening the government could not be done solely through the use of indirect fires, but also with platoon sized maneuver elements and partnerships with local leaders and influencers. The primary spheres of influence during this deployment included local, provincial, and regional governmental leaders, Iraqi Police, and Iraqi Army strategic infrastructure brigades that guarded the nation's crude oil pipelines. On 15 October 2007, 3-7 FA returned from Iraq to Schofield Barracks, Hawaii and was again awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. They spent the next year conducting a refit and training in preparation for their return to Northern Iraq.|$|R
50|$|This {{was one of}} {{the first}} times the United States Army had been able to use {{artillery}} against the Indians in the Southwest. Roberts ordered his infantry to take the hills overlooking the pass, while he remained in the pass to <b>direct</b> the <b>artillery</b> <b>support.</b> The skirmishers moved forward, where they were able to take cover in an abandoned Butterfield Overland Mail station. The soldiers were now about 600 yards from the spring. Overlooking the spring were two hills, one on the east, the other on the south. The Apache riflemen behind the breastworks on the hills were delivering a deadly fire against the attackers.|$|R
50|$|As part of {{the final}} {{preparation}} for the operation, the division's leaders conducted a two-hour sand model exercise at the division tactical command post (DTAC) at 1 p.m. All commanders and key staff officers down to battalion task force and separate company level rehearsed the opening phases of the division's operational plan. While the rehearsal was underway elements of the 19th Engineer Battalion moved earth-moving equipment to within six kilometers of the Saudi Arabia-Iraq international border berm. Sixteen bulldozers poised to breach the berm, the first anticipated obstacle to the division's northward movement. After the rehearsal confirmation of enemy positions throughout the sector of operations to the vicinity of Al Busayyah was finalized using aerial photos. The Force Artillery and <b>direct</b> <b>support</b> <b>artillery</b> battalions (2nd and 3rd Battalions, 1st Field Artillery and 2nd Battalion, 41st Field Artillery) adjusted target areas and brigade S2s were updated. At 9:15 p.m., an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter company from 3rd Battalion, 1st Aviation Regiment of the division's 4th Brigade, conducted armed reconnaissance missions out to Phase Line (PL) MELON. The results of the recon supported the division G2's prediction of few enemy forces capable of impeding the initial attack.|$|E
50|$|In December 1989, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery {{turned in}} their M102 howitzers {{and became the}} first unit in the US Army to field the M119. That same month, fire support {{elements}} from the battalion deployed to Panama during Operation JUST CAUSE with the 1st Brigade Task Force (DRB-2). The brigade served as part of Task Force ATLANTIC until it re-deployed in February 1991. In April 1993, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery moved from Fort Ord, California to Fort Lewis, Washington with the 1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division, often called the 9th Infantry Regimental Combat Team. On 21 January 1995, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to support humanitarian operations. During deployment the battalion was separated into two teams. Team Alpha, consisting of HHS and A Battery, operated Migrant Camp G. Team Bravo, consisting of B and C Batteries, operated Migrant Camp E. The 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery re-deployed to Fort Lewis on 7 June 1995. On 16 August 1995, the battalion was relieved from assignment to the 7th Infantry Division and assigned to the 25th Infantry Division, as the <b>direct</b> <b>support</b> <b>artillery</b> unit to the 1st Brigade (Lancers).|$|E
50|$|Even as the {{battalion}} assisted with mopping up operations around Metz, the tankers began to advance into Germany. Company B joined the 10th RCT and {{was attached to}} the 95th Infantry Division, forming the core of “Task Force Bell,” augmented further by Company D, the 6th Cavalry Group, a company of tank destroyers, a troop of the 28th Cavalry, and a <b>direct</b> <b>support</b> <b>artillery</b> battalion. TF Bell crossed the border into Germany between Creutzwald and Völklingen on 5 December with the objective of overwhelming German resistance along the upper Saar River. Over the next three days, TF Bell pushed steadily east and reached the Saar on 8 December. The remainder of {{the battalion}} crossed into Germany by 9 December 1944 and conducted maintenance on their vehicles over the next week while the 5th Infantry Division was again relieved by the 95th Infantry Division and went into reserve. On 16-17 December, Companies A and C moved to Saarlouis (then called Saarlautern), Germany to relieve the 778th Tank Battalion. The remainder of the battalion remained in the 95th Infantry Division’s sector, even though still attached to the 5th. The 95th however wanted them out of sector, and the battalion finally cleared their sector on 19 December.|$|E

50|$|The Unit Deployment Program (UDP) is {{a system}} for {{assigning}} deployments of the United States Marine Corps. To {{reduce the number of}} unaccompanied tours and improve unit continuity, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, (CMC) established it to provide for the deployment of units to the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) for periods of approximately six months. The initial program was a six-phased evolution that sequenced infantry battalions and aircraft squadrons/detachments into WESTPAC deployments, thus eliminating the 12-month permanent change of station assignments for personnel assigned to these units. The program commenced in October 1977 and has proceeded through the six phases. In August 1985, tank companies began phasing into the program but following Southwest Asia, were discontinued. In Fiscal Year 1987 (FY87) and FY88, Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) companies and <b>direct</b> <b>support</b> <b>artillery</b> batteries were phased in and later, Light Armored Reconnaissance (LAR) companies were also included in the program. The Marine Corps’ objective is to adhere as closely as possible to a six-month period of deployment away from a unit’s Continental United States (CONUS) home base. In the case of Hawaii-based infantry battalions, which employ a three-battalion rotation base, a seven-month period of deployment is executed to support the Unit Cohesion Program and efficient staffing of first term Marines. It must be understood, however, that shipping or airlift schedule variations, and exercise or contingency operations will occasionally necessitate longer or shorter deployments for participating units. It is imperative that all personnel involved in these deployments be kept fully informed of planned deployment duration and subsequent deployment schedule changes.|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. A study of {{existing}} and potential markets {{and of the}} technical and economical feasibility of a project, as well as sound finance planning, are indispensable. Economic profitability is the obvious and most important criteria for industrial project evaluation. The choice of interest rates in project management {{is the purpose of}} the thesis. The rate of interest should be adopted as discount rate in project evaluation. Because, the rate of interest reflects time preference and the opportunity cost of the possible alternative use of the capital invested. The interest rate is assumed to be constant during the project life in project evaluation techniques. In order to overcome this inability the constant rate should be replaced by time varying interest rates. iv Several forecast models aid project management to predict the valid interest rates in the evaluation. The thesis employs the expected-change forecast model to obtain interest rates for each year during the life cycle. An application of the model to one of the large-scale projects in the Armed Forces, namely modern self-propelled <b>direct</b> <b>support</b> <b>artillery</b> gun- SP 2000, is presented in the thesis. Comparison of two alternative uses of interest rates in the calculation of net present value of the project is discussed. It is concluded that the constant interest rate use overstates the costs and it is suggested that the time varying interest rates should be adopted as the optimal discount rates in project management.

50|$|Second Lieutenant Durham's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:2d Lt. Durham, Artillery, distinguished {{himself by}} conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity {{at the cost}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while assigned to Battery C. 2d Lt. Durham was serving as a forward observer with Company D, 2d Battalion, 28th Infantry during a battalion reconnaissance-in-force mission. At approximately 1015 hours contact was made with an enemy force concealed in well-camouflaged positions and fortified bunkers. 2d Lt. Durham immediately moved into an exposed position to adjust the <b>supporting</b> <b>artillery</b> fire onto the insurgents. During a brief lull in the battle he administered emergency first aid to the wounded in spite of heavy enemy sniper fire directed toward him. Moments later, as enemy units assaulted friendly positions, he learned that Company A, bearing the brunt of the attack, had lost its forward observer. While he was moving to replace the wounded observer, the enemy detonated a Claymore mine, severely wounding him in the head and impairing his vision. In spite of the intense pain, he continued to <b>direct</b> the <b>supporting</b> <b>artillery</b> fire and to employ his individual weapon in support of the hard pressed infantrymen. As the enemy pressed their attack, 2d Lt. Durham called for supporting fire to be placed almost directly on his position. Twice the insurgents were driven back, leaving many dead and wounded behind. 2d Lt. Durham was then taken to a secondary defensive position. Even in his extremely weakened condition, he continued to call artillery fire onto the enemy. He refused to seek cover and instead positioned himself in a small clearing which offered a better vantage point from which to adjust the fire. Suddenly, he was severely wounded a second time by enemy machine gun fire. As he lay on the ground near death, he saw two Viet Cong approaching, shooting the defenseless wounded men. With his last effort, 2d Lt. Durham shouted a warning to a nearby soldier who immediately killed the insurgents. 2d Lt. Durham died moments later, still grasping the radio handset. 2d Lt. Durham's gallant actions in close combat with an enemy force are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.|$|R

50|$|The Pakistani forces {{began their}} attack at 12:30 am. As the {{offensive}} approached the lone outpost, Pakistani artillery opened {{up across the}} border with medium artillery guns, killing five of the ten camels from the BSF detachment. As the column of 45 tanks neared the post, Indian defences, lacking the time to lay a prepared minefield, laid a hasty anti-tank minefield as the enemy advanced, one infantryman being killed in the process. The Indian infantry held fire until the leading Pakistani tanks had approached to 15-30 metres before firing their PIATs. They accounted {{for the first two}} tanks on the track with their Jeep-mounted 106 mm M40 recoilless rifle, with one of its crew being killed during the combat. This weapon proved quite effective because it was able to engage the thinner top armour of the Pakistani tanks from its elevated position, firing at often stationary bogged down vehicles. In all the post defenders claimed 12 tanks destroyed or damaged. The initial Pakistani attack stalled almost immediately when the infantry discovered the barbed wire which was unseen in the night, and interpreted it to signify a minefield. Firing for the Indian RCL crews was made easier by the flames of fires when the spare fuel tanks on the Pakistani tanks, intended to supplement their internal capacity for the advance to Jaisalmer, exploded, at once providing ample light for Indians located on higher ground, and creating a dense acrid smoke screen at ground level for the Pakistani infantry, adding to the confusion. Two hours were lost as Pakistani sappers were brought up, only to discover there was no minefield. However, at this time Pakistani infantry were required to make another attack, from a different direction, but in the dawn light. The Pakistani advance then attempted to surround the post two hours later by vehicles getting off the road, but many vehicles, particularly armoured personnel carriers and tanks, in trying to soften up the Indian defenders before attacking, became bogged in the soft sand of the area surrounding the post. Throughout the engagement Major Chandpuri continued to <b>direct</b> the <b>supporting</b> <b>artillery</b> fire.|$|R

Dunagan was leading an attack to relieve pressure on the battalion's forward support base when his company came under intense fire from a well-entrenched enemy battalion. Despite continuous hostile fire from a numerically superior force, Maj. Dunagan repeatedly and fearlessly exposed himself in order to locate enemy positions, <b>direct</b> friendly <b>supporting</b> <b>artillery,</b> and position the men of his company. In the early evening, while directing an element of his unit into perimeter guard, he was seriously wounded during an enemy mortar attack, but he refused to leave the battlefield and continued to supervise the evacuation of dead and wounded and to lead his command in the difficult task of disengaging from an aggressive enemy. In spite of painful wounds and extreme fatigue, Maj. Dunagan risked heavy fire on 2 occasions to rescue critically wounded men. He was again seriously wounded. Undaunted, he continued to display outstanding courage, professional competence, and leadership and successfully extricated his command from its untenable position on the evening of May 14. Having maneuvered his command into contact with an adjacent friendly unit, he learned that a 6-man party from his company was under fire and had not reached the new perimeter. Maj. Dunagan unhesitatingly went back and searched for his men. Finding 1 soldier critically wounded, Maj. Dunagan, ignoring his wounds, lifted the man to his shoulders and carried him to the comparative safety of the friendly perimeter. Before permitting himself to be evacuated, he insured all of his wounded received emergency treatment and were removed from the area. Throughout the engagement, Maj. Dunagan's actions gave great inspiration to his men and were directly responsible for saving the lives of many of his fellow soldiers. Maj.
