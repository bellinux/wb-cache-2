40|$|Many {{argue that}} {{monitoring}} conducted exclusively by scientists {{is insufficient to}} address ongoing environmental challenges. One solution entails the use of mobile digital devices in participatory monitoring (PM) programs. But how <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> affects programs with varying levels of stakeholder participation, from nonscientists collecting field data to nonscientists administering every step of a monitoring program, remains unclear. We reviewed the successes, in terms of management interventions and sustainability, of 107 monitoring programs described in the literature (hereafter programs) and compared these with case studies from our PM experiences in Australia, Canada, Ethiopia, Ghana, Greenland, and Vietnam (hereafter cases). Our literature review showed that participatory programs {{were less likely to}} use digital devices, and 2 of our 3 more participatory cases were also slow to adopt <b>digital</b> data <b>entry.</b> Programs that were participatory and used digital devices {{were more likely to report}} management actions, which was consistent with cases in Ethiopia, Greenland, and Australia. Programs engaging volunteers were more frequently reported as ongoing, but those involving <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> were less often sustained when data collectors were volunteers. For the Vietnamese and Canadian cases, sustainability was undermined by a mismatch in stakeholder objectives. In the Ghanaian case, complex field protocols diminished monitoring sustainability. Innovative technologies attract interest, but the foundation of effective participatory adaptive monitoring depends more on collaboratively defined questions, objectives, conceptual models, and monitoring approaches. When this foundation is built through effective partnerships, <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> can enable the collection of more data of higher quality. Without this foundation, or when implemented ineffectively or unnecessarily, <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> can be an additional expense that distracts from core monitoring objectives and undermines project sustainability. The appropriate role of <b>digital</b> data <b>entry</b> in PM likely depends more on the context in which it is used and less on the technology itself. </p...|$|R

In 2008, in recognition of the Museum’s important mission of celebrating the art of the East End, the format changed. Submissions were limited to artists from eastern Long Island, whose <b>digital</b> <b>entries</b> were reviewed by nine established artists from the region. Each juror gradually narrowed his or her choices until a single selection was made. The nine chosen artists exhibited their work in tandem with the artists who selected them.

40|$|International audienceDigital {{curation}} is {{the global}} concept that includes {{all aspects of}} work on digitized and born digital cultural objects: from document entry to data description or indexing, storage, dissemination, and long-term preservation. It is an expanding activity, whose rules and best practices are not globally defined yet. The BnF has chosen to rely on observations {{on the ground to}} understand how its staff, faced with the urgent need to collect and preserve a fast-growing digital heritage, is developing new tasks and skills. A dedicated group called ORHION, a French acronym for Observatory of Organizations and Human Resources under Digital Influence, has launched a series of studies on professional identities that are particularly affected by the increasing shift to digital activities. It has so far completed its analysis of two subjects: metadata curation and <b>digital</b> <b>entries.</b> In order to assess the BnF's practices, ORHION also relies on other institutions' experiences. It has for instance organized a workshop on web archive curation during this year's general assembly of the International Internet Preservation Consortium, in May 2014. This paper focuses on the findings of these three use case analyses: the switch from cataloguing to metadata management for description and access; the processes and agents involved in digital entries; and the organization, skills and training of web curating teams. Based on these three experiences, this paper seeks to identify some key trends in digital curation: the notion of digital collection itself is not obvious and needs to be rethought; professional identities are challenged by the apparition of new tasks and the emergence of new actors; stakeholders struggle to understand their own roles and responsibilities in more complex treatment channels.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{electronic}} Dietary Intake Assessment (e-DIA), a <b>digital</b> <b>entry</b> food record {{mobile phone}} app, {{was developed to}} measure energy and nutrient intake prospectively. This {{can be used in}} monitoring population intakes or intervention studies in young adults. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the relative validity of e-DIA as a dietary assessment tool for energy and nutrient intakes using the 24 -hour dietary recall as a reference method. METHODS: University students aged 19 to 24 years recorded their food and drink intake on the e-DIA for five days consecutively and completed 24 -hour dietary recalls on three random days during this 5 -day study period. Mean differences in energy, macro-, and micronutrient intakes were evaluated between the methods using paired t tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and correlation coefficients were calculated on unadjusted, energy-adjusted, and deattenuated values. Bland-Altman plots and cross-classification into quartiles were used to assess agreement between the two methods. RESULTS: Eighty participants completed the study (38 % male). No {{significant differences were found between}} the two methods for mean intakes of energy or nutrients. Deattenuated correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 55 to 0. 79 (mean 0. 68). Bland-Altman plots showed wide limits of agreement between the methods but without obvious bias. Cross-classification into same or adjacent quartiles ranged from 75 % to 93 % (mean 85 %). CONCLUSIONS: The e-DIA shows potential as a dietary intake assessment tool at a group level with good ranking agreement for energy and all nutrients. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
