5|$|Boone {{served as}} syndic and commandant until 1804, when Missouri {{became part of}} the United States {{following}} the Louisiana Purchase. Because Boone's land <b>grants</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Spanish government had been largely based on verbal agreements, he once again lost his land claims. In 1809, he petitioned Congress to restore his Spanish land claims, which was finally done in 1814. Boone sold most of this land to repay old Kentucky debts. When the War of 1812 came to Missouri, Boone's sons Daniel Morgan Boone and Nathan Boone took part, but by that time Boone was much too old for militia duty.|$|E

5|$|In March 1998, {{after the}} closure of Europe's last tin mine at South Crofty in Cornwall (which later reopened for a period, and {{subsequently}} closed), the Cornish Solidarity Action Group (CSAG) encouraged commuters to pay the then-£1 toll in pennies. The group thought this would slow down collection of tolls and cause widespread congestion across the local area. The CSAG believed Cornwall should receive similar subsidies to South Wales and Merseyside, which were receiving regeneration <b>grants</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> government.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} the {{difficulties}} in raising capital for these expansions and despite MIT's privately endowed status, Walker {{and other members of}} the Corporation lobbied the Massachusetts legislature for a $200,000 grant to aid in the industrial development of the Commonwealth ($ in 2016 dollars). After intensive negotiations that called upon Walker's extensive connections and civic experience, in 1887 the legislature made a grant of $300,000 over two years to the Institute, which would lead to a total of $1.6 million in <b>grants</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth before the practice was discontinued in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{personal}} interest in classical opera and dance led him to support the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden and the Ballet Company at Sadler's Wells. During the war, {{as a member of}} CEMA (Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts), Keynes helped secure government funds to maintain both companies while their venues were shut. Following the war, Keynes was instrumental in establishing the Arts Council of Great Britain and was its founding chairman in 1946. Unsurprisingly, from the start the two organisations that received the largest <b>grants</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> new body were the Royal Opera House and Sadler's Wells.|$|E
5|$|Six {{people were}} killed in the Dominican Republic and another {{fourteen}} in Haiti. Three were killed in Jamaica, which also suffered US$310million of damage—the heaviest in the Caribbean. The most severe damage there was to the agricultural sector; nearly the entire banana crop was destroyed. Global aid organizations contributed to the subsequent recovery effort; immediate life-saving needs were met within days, but the damage to Jamaica's infrastructure and economy took much longer to repair. With loans and <b>grants</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> local government, the European Union, and the United Nations, normality was restored by the following summer.|$|E

5|$|Tim Waterstone and James Daunt {{have been}} {{critical}} of tax avoidance by Amazon.com in the British press. Amazon has received sustained scrutiny for the amount of its overall sales that are reported by its UK subsidiary, in comparison to those 'processed offshore in Luxembourg to avoid UK tax'. In the 2012-13 financial year, Amazon paid £3.2 million in tax on sales of £4.2 billion and received £2.5 million in <b>grants</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> government. In the same period, it was revealed that Waterstones paid £11.9 million in tax, despite an operating loss of £25.4 million and sales of £410.4 million.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{accepted}} {{the presidency of}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1881, a position he held for fifteen years until his death. During his tenure, he placed the institution on more stable financial footing by aggressively fund-raising and securing <b>grants</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Massachusetts government, implemented many curricular reforms, oversaw the launch of new academic programs, and expanded the size of the Boston campus, faculty, and student enrollments. MIT's Walker Memorial Hall, a former students' clubhouse and one of the original buildings on the Charles River campus, was dedicated to him in 1916.|$|E

5|$|Bennett was to {{find that}} heading a leading music college was {{incompatible}} with {{a career as a}} composer. The post of Principal was traditionally not arduous. He was contractually required to attend for only six hours a week, teaching composition and arranging class-lists. But Bennett had not only to run the RAM but to save it from imminent dissolution. The RAM had been temporarily saved from bankruptcy by <b>grants</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> government, authorised by Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1864 and 1865. The following year Gladstone was out of office, and the new Chancellor, Disraeli, refused to renew the grant. The directors of the RAM decided to close it, over the head of Bennett as Principal. Bennett, {{with the support of the}} faculty and the students, assumed the Chairmanship of the board of directors.|$|E
5|$|Coloman routed two {{bands of}} crusaders (the {{perpetrators}} of the Rhineland massacres) who were plundering the Western borderlands and defeated Petar Svačić in Croatia. The late 14th-century Pacta conventa states that Coloman was crowned king of Croatia after concluding {{an agreement with}} twelve local noblemen. Although most probably a forgery, the document reflects the actual status of Croatia proper, which was never incorporated into Hungary. In contrast, the region known as Slavonia, between the Petrova Mounts and the river Dráva, became closely connected to Hungary. Here many Hungarian noblemen received land <b>grants</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> monarchs. Zadar, Split and other Dalmatian towns also accepted Coloman's suzerainty in 1105, but their right to elect their own bishops and leaders remained unchained. In Croatia and Slavonia, the sovereign was represented by governors bearing the title ban. Likewise, a royal official, the voivode, administered Transylvania, the eastern borderland of the kingdom.|$|E
