He scored two goals in the <b>gold</b> <b>medal</b> game, a 5–2 victory over the United States, as Canada won its first Olympic <b>gold</b> <b>medal</b> in 50years. With this win, Iginla became the first black man to win a <b>gold</b> <b>medal</b> at the Winter Olympics. Iginla also represented Canada at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey as an alternate captain, playing on a line with Joe Sakic and Mario Lemieux. Canada won the <b>gold</b> <b>medal.</b>|$|E

The Finnish team was not considered a serious medal contender—it had competed in the World Championships since 1939 and had not won a single medal. However, Finland upset the Soviets 2–1 and won silver. The IIHF decided to change the tournament format because in several cases, the <b>gold</b> <b>medal</b> winner had been decided before {{the final day of}} play. During a congress in 1990, the IIHF introduced a playoff system. The new system was used at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France.
