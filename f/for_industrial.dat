5|$|After it is dissolved, osmium is {{separated}} from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide. The first method {{is similar to the}} procedure used by Tennant and Wollaston. Both methods are suitable <b>for</b> <b>industrial</b> scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques.|$|E
