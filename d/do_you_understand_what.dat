My meaning is, that no man can expect his children to respect what he degrades.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now I'm {{beginning}} {{to understand why the}} SRB machines couldn't factor him. It's impossible for us to understand this kind of person.

Why does this make one feel that we are so young a people?' The speaker struck passionately at a tall weed. 'We have nowhere left our mark yet. Nowhere!

6000|$|SIR HOWARD (rather stiffly). I {{really do}} not see how I need your commiseration, Cicely.

6000|$|... "Nothing of the sort. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> I mean by {{the verb}} to koepenick?

6000|$|... "It is {{a strange}} story indeed, Ulf, and {{whatever}} it may mean, this meeting can have been for no good purpose. The secrecy with which it was conducted is enough to prove it.

I wanted to see white men bowing low before the power of your beauty and your wealth. Old as I am I wished to seek a strange land, a civilisation to which I am a stranger, so as to find a new life in the contemplation of your high fortunes, of your triumphs, of your happiness. For that I bore patiently the burden of work, of disappointment, of humiliation amongst these savages here, and I had it all nearly in my grasp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no. Ages afterward. No {{child could}} have made that discovery. Do you know the {{greatest}} difference there is between us?

40|$|Have {{you found}} it hard to hit the jackpot when hunting for a job? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> really <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> the recruiters are looking for when you apply for a job? To what extent <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think social ties are crucial in the recruitment, job hunting and {{promotion}} processes? This book aims to explore the mechanisms involved when recruiters recruit new staff members, job hunters hunt for a new job and employees seek for promotion. In particular, via in-depth interviews with 40 staff members in publishing sector in the UK, the author studied the circumstances in which recruiters and job hunters use social ties in the recruitment and promotion processes. This book does not only contribute to the theoretical discussion in sociology, but also helps the readers to explore the insider perspective of the job market. Although this is a case study of the publishing sector in the UK, the findings should be able to shed light on other industrial sectors and across the board. This book should help to achieve more effective results for job hunters, HR staff members and recruiters in general in the future...|$|R
