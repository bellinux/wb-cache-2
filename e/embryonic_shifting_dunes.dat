40|$|We {{studied the}} spatial {{organisation}} of an ensemble (phylogenetically bounded {{group of species}} that use a similar set of resources within a community) of tenebrionid beetles in a Mediterranean coastal sand dune ecosystem in Southern Italy (Molise region). Within a transect from the seashore to the inner dune, we identified four biotopes defined by different vegetation types. We found a community dominated by few sand specialised and r-selected tenebrionid species. Overall tenebrionid abundance was lowest on the upper beach, highest on the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> and then from there declined further inland. The <b>embryonic</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> biotope showed the highest diversity and the lowest dominance. This pattern suggests that tenebrionid beetels are {{able to cope with}} the challenging salty and xerothermic conditions of the seaward margin. Although some species were too rare to assess their biotope preference, our data support that, at least some, were distributed with different abundance over the four dune biotopes. These differences are likely related to different preferences for different characteristics of substratum and detritus...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of the {{analysis}} of plant communities/habitats, flora, fauna and macromycetes present in a small but very significant sector of the Lido di Venezia coast. The almost total reduction human pressures during about forty years, drives the area to the recovery of habitats of the High Adriatic coast. Among the most significant habitats there are: 1210 - Annual vegetation of drift lines, 2110 - <b>Embryonic</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes,</b> 2130 * - Fixed coastal dunes with herbaceous vegetation (gray dunes), 7210 * - Calcareous fens with Cladium mariscus and species of the Caricion davallianae, 6420 - Mediterranean tall humid herb grasslands of the Molinio-Holoschoenion. All the multidisciplinary assessments show the strengths of the recover paths. The floristic survey led to the discovery of rare species of Veneto, among other Centaurium littorale and Cutandia maritima. The observations on birds recorded the presence of species such as Charadrius alexandrinus and Sternula albifrons in the near the sea sector, and the nesting of Caprimulgus europaeus and Lanius collurio. Even the mycological surveys confirm the ecosystem recover, increasing the consistency between existing and potential conditions. The paper also shows the advantages and the limits of some coastal management approaches...|$|E
40|$|Cutandia maritima is a circum-Mediterranean {{species that}} inhabits sandy dunes {{along the coast}} line. It is fairly {{frequent}} on the western Adriatic coast but fairly rare and possibly even non-native in the east. In Croatia, it was discovered in 1990 in Crnika Bay {{on the island of}} Rab, which was considered until 2005 to be the only site on the eastern Adriatic coast from the Gulf of Trieste in the north to Corfu in the south. In 2009, the species was briefly reported for Velika plaža (Long Beach) in Ulcinj (Montenegro) but without details about the habitat type and synecology. The aim of this paper is thus to provide a deeper insight into the ecology and synecology of C. maritima in the eastern Adriatic part of the distribution area. On Velika plaža in Ulcinj, the species was found along the whole sea-inland gradient of sand dunes, in various types of vegetation: [1210] - annual vegetation of drift lines, [2110] - <b>embryonic</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes,</b> [2120] - shifting dunes with Ammophila arenaria (white dunes), [2220] - dunes with Euphorbia terracina, [2130 *] - fixed coastal dunes with herbaceous vegetation (grey dunes), and also [2190] - humid dune slacks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{compared}} the Atlantic and Mediterranean beach and foredune habitats of European interest, focusing on floristic, structural and ecological features. We selected two representative sites of Atlantic (The Netherlands) and Mediterranean (Italy) coastal dunes. From a georeferenced vegetation database, samples of: (a) annual vegetation on drift lines (European Union habitat type 1210), (b) <b>embryonic</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> (2110), and (c) shifting dunes {{along the shoreline}} with Ammophila arenaria (2120), were selected. Floristic representativity and comparability of plot sizes were considered. For each habitat, the frequency and the fidelity of the species, the life form frequency spectra and Ellenberg ecological indicator values were assessed. We found a consistent floristic differentiation between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean coastal dune habitats and only a small set of shared species. The Italian and the Dutch annual vegetation of drift lines (1210) register a high structural similarity that strongly declines landwards. Floristic composition, life forms and Ellenberg indicator values show higher similarities among different foredune habitats of the same site than between homologous habitats of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. The results confirm the current description and distribution of the habitat of European interest annual vegetation of drift lines (1210). On the other hand, the floristic, structural and ecological differences between the Atlantic and the Mediterranea...|$|E
40|$|Sandy beaches {{surrounding}} the Molise coast, facing to the Adriatic sea, are relatively well preserved {{if compared with}} other Italian littorals. In this study we present the results from a short term monitoring analyses of coastal habitats (six/eight-years) using permanent transects {{as part of the}} LTER network (Long Term Ecological Research-Italy). Vegetation monitoring was carried out along 4 belt transects along the beach-inland ecological gradient, following the coastal zonation and ranging from pioneer annual communities on the beach to Mediterranean scrubs on fixed dunes. Plant communities were sampled in contiguous 1 m x 1 m plots using a 1 - 10 ordinal transform scale to estimates the species' cover-abundance. All transects were conducted in sites subjected to a similar touristic pressure. Through cluster analysis we identified 5 Habitats of community interest: Annual vegetation of drift lines (Habitat 1210), <b>Embryonic</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> (Habitat 2110), Shifting dunes along the shoreline with Ammophila arenaria (Habitat 2120), Malcolmietalia dune grasslands (Habitat 2230) and Coastal dunes with Juniperus spp. (Habitat 2250). Main temporal changes were probably related to different erosion/accretion processes acting in each transect: two transects were relatively stable (without evident coastal erosion nor accretion processes), one suffered a strong retreat while the last transect showed a slight accretion process. Moreover, our study evidences that, as coastal plant communities are highly dynamic systems, even relatively short time periods could offer useful insights of annual vegetation trends...|$|E
40|$|In {{southwest}} Europe (mainland Portugal), the psammophilic ecosystems {{of coastal}} beaches and sand dunes are {{distributed by the}} Eurosiberian (EUR) and Mediterranean (MED) biogeographic regions. In addition to climatic and other environmental factors, distinct plant communities are mainly influenced by the instability of the coastal sands and the proximity to the sea. Psammophilic gradients determine the plant communities that occur from the first sectors of the beach until the more interior dunes, being expressed by specific floristic associations and different rates of cover, namely by endemic taxa. The analysis of 601 phytosociological relevés, conducted between 1972 and 2010, from north (Minho) to the south (Alentejo and Algarve), allowed to study the dominant communities which occur along the ecological gradient sea-interior, {{with the aim of}} better understand general spatial geomorphologic and phytogeographic trends of distribution. As for the sea-interior gradient, no endemic flora appears in the first vegetation strip (annual communities of drift lines). Yet, some endemic species appear in the <b>embryonic</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> of the back beach, with endemic species’ coverage of 1. 07 % (EUR) and 1. 7 % (MED). In the mobile dunes (white dunes) covers by endemic flora are more significant: 6. 95 % (EUR) against 4. 14 % (MED). Semi-stable dune (gray dune), is composed by three associations (EUR, MED and another of Transition (ART) which occurs between the former two), who have the highest covers for endemics: 38, 89 % (EUR) 43, 37 % (TRA) and 55, 85 % (MED). Do not considering specific human induced situations of degradation and erosion, a general trend of gradual coverage growth by endemic taxa, was signed from north to south, despite median overall covers (total species) are higher in the north. The endemic taxa have been separated into endemic Portuguese (EP), Iberian (EI) and European (EU) and its representativeness endorsed.

40|$|Questions How can the {{conservation}} status of Mediterranean coastal dunes be assessed? What {{is the effect}} of disturbance factors on it? Location Tyrrhenian coast of Central Italy. Methods Vegetation releves along 164 transects lying perpendicular to the shoreline along the Tyrrhenian coast of Central Italy were used to identify the presence of dune habitats by means of TWINSPAN classification and detrended correspondence analysis. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to analyse relationship between habitats and disturbance factors. The resulting Burt's table was used to build an index (habitat-disturbance, HDi) for analysing this relationship. Based on HDi values, a correspondence analysis (CA) between presence/absence of habitats and disturbances was performed. The overall plant species diversity of dunes was measured with NHDUNE, {{a modified version of the}} Shannon index. Multi-way ANOVA procedure was used to investigate effect of single disturbance factors and their interactive effect on NHDUNE. Results Classification and ordination procedures identified four sequential habitats moving from the shoreline to inland: annual vegetation on drift lines characterized by Cakile maritima; <b>embryonic</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> dominated by Elymus farctus; shifting dunes with Ammophila arenaria subsp. australis; back dune grasslands characterized by Ononis variegata. CA showed that disturbance factors influence dune habitats differently. In particular, the Cakile community had a negative relationship with beach tourism and mechanical cleaning; the Elymus community had a positive relationship with beach tourism and mechanical cleaning and a negative relationship with erosion and bathing establishments; the Ammophila community had a negative relationship with mechanical cleaning and bathing establishments and a positive relationship with dune cross-trampling; and the Ononis community had a negative relationship with bathing establishment. According to multi-way ANOVA, single disturbance factors can have different effects on plant species diversity as measured by NHDUNE. However, the overall effect is negative, with erosion as a single factor and the combination of mechanical cleaning and bathing establishments significantly lowering the plant diversity of coastal dune systems. Conclusions The proposed method allows a fast and replicable evaluation of the effects of disturbance factors on {{the conservation}} status of Mediterranean coastal dunes, providing the information necessary for development of conservation strategies focusing on a single habitat or on the overall dune system...|$|E

50|$|In {{northern}} Jutland in the 16th and 17th centuries <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> were {{a problem}} for the population: huge dunes, some stretching up to 7 km (4 mi) inland, drove them back from the coastal areas, but in the 19th century the government acted to alleviate the problem. The Sand Drift Act of 1857 allowed the state to buy or expropriate areas of sand drift, and a further Act in 1857 allowed the purchase of areas adjacent to the drifts. Dune grasses and conifers were planted to stabilize the sands and these plantations became common after 1880. Although barren, the dune zone allowed limited sheep farming and some inshore fishing. By the 1950s the dune drifts were under control.|$|R
40|$|Aim Biogeographical {{patterns}} in metacommunities are still poorly understood, and different processes {{are expected to}} occur in different habitats. We analysed the regional plant metacommunities of coastal habitats to test whether (1) the influence of space and climate differs between two habitats differentiated along the seashore–inland gradient, and (2) regional variation in species composition of these habitats can be ascribed to different metacommunity paradigms. Location The entire coast of the Iberian Peninsula, south-western Europe. Methods We collected data on the plant species composition of coastal sites on sand dunes across 3000 km of coastline. The sites were classified into two habitats corresponding to shifting and stable sand dunes, and divided into three distinct geographical regions: Cantabrian, Atlantic and Mediterranean. We assessed the geographical structure of the species composition using ordination, estimates of species turnover and spatial autocorrelation. We then used multivariate models and variation partitioning to test the influence of climatic and spatial effects. Analyses were conducted for the whole data set and the geographical subsets. Results Metacommunities from <b>shifting</b> and stable <b>dunes</b> showed similar spa- tial patterns, with the highest species turnover occurring in the Mediterranean region. Similarities between communities that were nearer each other (typically < 100 km) were weaker in shifting than in stable dunes, although the distance decay for sites that were further apart was similar in both habitats. Variation in species composition in <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> was mainly explained by distance and climate, while in stable dunes the effect of climate was clearly dominant. The observed differences were relatively consistent across geographical regions. Main conclusions Distinct processes structure the metacommunities in two dune habitats differentiated along the seashore–inland gradient. Communities of <b>shifting</b> <b>dunes</b> seem to be structured by an interplay of neutral or patch-dynamic processes {{and to a lesser}} degree by species sorting. In contrast, communities of stable dunes are mainly governed by species sorting in response to climatic gradi- ents. These results highlight the importance of differentiating habitats according to local ecological factors when analysing regional {{patterns in}} metacommunities...|$|R

50|$|The {{soil of the}} Thar Desert in India remains dry {{for much}} of the year and is prone to wind erosion.
