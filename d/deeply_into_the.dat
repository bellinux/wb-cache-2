5|$|Numerous {{parasite}}s {{are known}} for this species, and both juveniles and adults often carry heavy parasite loads. Known internal parasites include the monogenean Squalonchocotyle spinacis, the tapeworms Aporhynchus norvegicus, Lacistorhynchus tenuis, and Phyllobothrium squali, and the nematodes Anisakis simplex and Hysterothylacium aduncum. Some of these parasites use the velvet belly's prey as intermediate hosts and are acquired via ingestion, while others use the shark itself as an intermediate host. The barnacle Anelasma squalicola, an external parasite, attaches to the shark's dorsal spine socket and penetrates <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> muscle, in the process often providing an attachment site for a second (and rarely a third) barnacle. Infestation by this barnacle reduces its host's fecundity by impairing {{the development of the}} reproductive organs.|$|E
5|$|Pairs did not {{cooperate}} in feeding, {{at least not}} in a strict sense. All such reports are based on misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist Walter Buller of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae. According to this misunderstanding, which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tunnels with her long, pliant bill. Rather, the divergent bills represent an extreme example of niche differentiation, reducing intraspecific competition between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.|$|E
5|$|Dracula's Daughter was {{the last}} in the first cycle of Universal Horror films that reached back into the 1920s. Publicly, Universal {{said it was because}} a British ban on horror films would cut too <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> revenue such films could generate. In truth, the cycle was {{suspended}} because, just before filming on Dracula's Daughter had wrapped, the Laemmle family had lost control of Universal. Because of cost overruns on a number of pictures, Junior Laemmle was forced to borrow $1,000,000 on November 1, 1935. The money came from J. Cheever Cowdin, head of the Standard Capital Corporation, and from Charles R. Rogers. When the loan was called in March of the following year, Universal was unable to repay it. Standard assumed control of the studio on March 4, 1936 and Rogers replaced Junior as head of production. Rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following the release of Dracula's Daughter to focus on fare like Deanna Durbin musicals. Universal would not return to the horror genre for three years, when it released Son of Frankenstein in 1939.|$|E

5|$|In the north, they {{hibernate}} {{during the}} winter. Niell (1947, 1948) made observations in Georgia, and noted {{they were one}} of the last species to seek shelter, often being found active until the first heavy frosts. At this point, they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark. These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow more <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> soft wood or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November. During a period of three or four days, as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming across Back Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland. He suggested this might {{have something to do with}} hibernating habits. In the southern parts of its range, hibernation may be short or omitted altogether.|$|E
5|$|Some uses {{of heavy}} metals, {{including}} in sport, mechanical engineering, military ordnance, and nuclear science, {{take advantage of}} their relatively high densities. In underwater diving, lead is used as a ballast; in handicap horse racing each horse must carry a specified lead weight, based on factors including past performance, so as to equalize the chances of the various competitors. In golf, tungsten, brass, or copper inserts in fairway clubs and irons lower the centre of gravity of the club making it easier to get the ball into the air; and golf balls with tungsten cores are claimed to have better flight characteristics. In fly fishing, sinking fly lines have a PVC coating embedded with tungsten powder, so that they sink at the required rate. In track and field sport, steel balls used in the hammer throw and shot put events are filled with lead in order to attain the minimum weight required under international rules. Tungsten was used in hammer throw balls at least up to 1980; the minimum size of the ball was increased in 1981 to eliminate the need for what was, at that time, an expensive metal (triple the cost of other hammers) not generally available in all countries. Tungsten hammers were so dense that they penetrated too <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> turf.|$|E

25|$|Microwave {{volumetric}} heating (MVH) is {{the newest}} available pasteurization technology. It uses microwaves to heat liquids, suspensions, or semi-solids in a continuous flow. Because MVH delivers energy evenly and <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> whole body of a flowing product, it allows for gentler and shorter heating, so that almost all heat-sensitive substances in the milk are preserved.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{an established}} {{medical imaging technique}} that uses light to capture micrometer-resolution, three-dimensional images from within optical scattering media (e.g., biological tissue). Optical coherence tomography is based on low-coherence interferometry, typically employing near-infrared light. The use of relatively long wavelength light allows it to penetrate into the scattering medium. Confocal microscopy, another optical technique, typically penetrates less <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sample but with higher resolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{plant has}} a {{branching}} root system with one primary root that reaches <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> moist soil. Buckwheat has triangular seeds and produces a flower {{that is usually}} white, although can also be pink or yellow. Buckwheat branches freely, as opposed to tillering or producing suckers, causing a more complete adaption to its environment than other cereal crops. The seed hull density is {{less than that of}} water, making the hull easy to remove.|$|E

25|$|Also {{much like}} Williams is the {{theological}} and philosophical subtext. Ms. Carl takes {{the ideas of}} good vs. evil quite seriously and probes <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> idea of redemption. She does not, however, take her themes lightly, instead giving them a vigorous shaking down before she's done, resulting in a gripping spiritual thriller. One could easily call this 'in the tradition of Charles Williams' — which it certainly is — but it more importantly moves beyond that master of the spiritual thriller.|$|E
25|$|By {{the twentieth}} century, Buddhism had {{penetrated}} <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> culture of Mongolia, and the populace willingly supported the lamas and the monasteries. Foreign observers usually {{had a negative}} opinion of Mongolian monks, condemning them as lazy, ignorant, corrupt, and debauched, but the Mongolian people did not concur. Ordinary Mongolians apparently combined a cynical and realistic anticlericalism, sensitive to the faults and the human fallibility of individual monks or groups of monks, with a deep and unwavering concern for the transcendent values of the church.|$|E
25|$|The Brothers Karamazov is {{a passionate}} {{philosophical}} novel set in 19th-century Russia, that enters <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ethical debates of God, free will, and morality. It {{is a spiritual}} drama of moral struggles concerning faith, doubt, judgment, and reason, set against a modernizing Russia, with a plot which revolves around the subject of patricide. Dostoyevsky composed much of the novel in Staraya Russa, which inspired the main setting. Since its publication, it has been acclaimed {{as one of the}} supreme achievements in world literature.|$|E

25|$|During Wall's presidency, the NMU shed {{nearly half}} its membership. The {{increasing}} use of flags of convenience cut <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> number of American merchant seamen. The use of much larger ships (reducing the number of transports needed to move {{the same amount of}} goods) and technological innovation (reducing the number of seamen needed to man a ship) also led to significant reductions in eligible members. Wall was a strong proponent of mergers between various maritime unions, and the organizing of an international union to cover all maritime workers.|$|E
25|$|In March, Lee {{passed along}} War Department orders to begin {{transferring}} regiments from Florida to Tennessee to reinstate operations following the “disasters to our arms” there. Georgian troops {{had been sent}} to Virginia in July, additional Georgians would be moved to Tennessee also. The Confederate government required a withdrawal from seaboard forces into the interior of South Carolina and Georgia to better secure the breadbasket plantations feeding the armies. In Florida, only the Apalachicola River had to be defended at all costs because Federal gunboats could penetrate so <b>deeply</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Georgia interior.|$|E
25|$|The {{connection}} between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage—in particular, investigative coverage by The Washington Post, Time, and The New York Times.
