25|$|The {{classical}} Fourier transform on Rn {{is still}} an area of ongoing research, particularly concerning Fourier transformation on more general objects such as tempered distributions. For instance, if we impose some requirements on a <b>distribution</b> <b>f,</b> we can attempt to translate these requirements {{in terms of the}} Fourier transform of f. The Paley–Wiener theorem is an example of this. The Paley–Wiener theorem immediately implies that if f is a nonzero distribution of compact support (these include functions of compact support), then its Fourier transform is never compactly supported. This is a very elementary form of an uncertainty principle in a harmonic analysis setting. See also: Convergence of Fourier series.|$|E
25|$|Fasciolosis {{is caused}} by two digenetic trematodes F. hepatica and F. gigantica. Adult flukes of both species are {{localized}} in the bile ducts of the liver or gallbladder. F. hepatica measures 2 to 3cm and has a cosmopolitan <b>distribution.</b> <b>F.</b> gigantica measures 4 to 10cm in length {{and the distribution of}} the species is limited to the tropics and has been recorded in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and south and eastern Asia. In domestic livestock in Japan, diploid (2n = 20), triploid (3n = 30) and chimeric flukes (2n/3n) have been described, many of which reproduce parthenogenetically. As a result of this unclear classification, flukes in Japan are normally referred to as Fasciola spp. Recent reports based on mitochondrial genes analysis has shown that Japanese Fasciola spp. is more closely related to F. gigantica than to F. hepatica. In India, a species called F. jacksoni was described in elephants.|$|E
