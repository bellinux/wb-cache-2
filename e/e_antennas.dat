40|$|Abstract — The {{complexity}} of modern telecommunication systems requires increasingly important needs for modeling and rigorous analysis. Thus, {{it is more}} and more required to predict the performances of power amplifiers (PAs) on the Tx-Rx chains. This paper focuses on behavioral modeling approach for a PAs used in agile antennas application. This approach of active antennas can take into account the interactions between the nonlinear circuits (i. e.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate how}} {{the enhancement of}} the radiative decay rate of a spontaneous emitter provided by coupling to an optical antenna is modified when this "superemitter" is introduced into a complex photonic environment that provides an enhanced local density of optical states (LDOS) itself, such as a microcavity. We show that photonic environments with increased LDOS further boost the performance of antennas that scatter weakly, i. e. that are far from the unitary limit, for which a simple multiplicative LDOS lumping rule holds. In contrast, enhancements provided by antennas close to the unitary limit, i. <b>e.</b> <b>antennas</b> close to the limit of maximally possible scattering strength, are strongly reduced by an enhanced LDOS of the environment.

Antenna performance is compared with physical bounds or optimum-current performance in the situations studied. The results presented in this thesis suggest that single-frequency methods may reduce the time necessary to optimize automatically, e. g., using a computer, some antenna parameters such as bandwidth. Furthermore, physical bounds and optimum current distributions are tools that provide valuable information for the processes of antenna analysis and design...|$|E

40|$|The {{accuracy}} and reliability of the GPS system mainly depend on the GPS receivercomponents i. e. the GPS antenna and receiver. GPS receiver components are influencedby their types and methods of calibration. Antenna calibration determines individual GPSantenna phase variations, considering specified orientation. Different approaches ofantenna calibrations provide different GPS accuracies. Therefore, {{in order to obtain}} therequired accuracy from specific campaign of GPS measurements, selection of suitableantenna types and use of the same antenna and calibration method are recommended. TheGPS antenna part of this thesis is focused on the effects of changing antenna orientationfrom originally calibrated direction (north), and then on the effects of mixing differenttypes of GPS antennas. Trimble Compact L 1 /L 2, Zephyr Geodetic, Leica AT 502, andAshtech 701945 E_M Rev <b>E</b> <b>antennas</b> and Trimble R 7, Trimble 4000 SSE, and Leicareceivers are used for this investigation. Orientation effects of antennas are studied by using two Trimble receivers and Ashtechantenna. Significant variations are observed on the horizontal vector components than onthe height vector components and maximum variations are observed when rover stationantenna pointing south. Form the investigation made on the effects of mixing differenttypes of antennas great variations are observed on the height vector components than onthe horizontal vector components, which range from ± 2 to 4 cm and variation reachedmaximum at Leica-to-Ashtech antenna combinations. They increase by ± 1 - 2 mm and ± 2 - 3 cm on the horizontal and on the vertical vector components, (respectively) whenantenna correction factors are removed from the rover station. From the investigationmade on the effects of mixing different types of GPS receivers the variations on thevertical vector components mostly lie between ± 6 - 8 mm,whereas the variation on thehorizontal vector components lie between ± 2 mm. The result shows an agreement withpreviously done experiment by Freymueller (1992). Moreover, maximum variations areobserved to Trimble R 7 -to-Trimble 4000 SSE and/or Trimble R 7 -to-Leica receiver withLeica-to-Ashtech antenna combinations. However, effects of mixing different types ofGPS receivers are smaller when comparing with the effects of mixing different types ofGPS receivers. Therefore, this agreed with Völksen (2002). Finally, this investigation has given an insight for the need of giving particular attentionwhen mixing different types of GPS antennas and/or receivers to the same campaign,specifically, which needs greater height accuracy. The thesis also recommends that theneed and importance of further research using greater numbers and types of GPSinstruments using the same and/or different approach to arrive at quantifiable values ofthe effects on each vector components and to investigate the sources of strange results...|$|E
40|$|Prather, Dennis W. To {{extend the}} sensing of human vision, radio {{frequencies}} have found prolific wireless applications in everyday life, e. g., wireless communication, radar, and radiometry. To overcome the crowded microwave spectrum, millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies have gained tremendous {{interest in these}} systems within several spectral windows, i. e., 35 GHz, 77 GHz, 95 GHz, and 140 GHz, due to their low atmospheric propagation loss. Additionally, mmWs can provide gigabyte data transmission rates for wireless communication systems and high resolution for radar and radiometry systems. To date, most mmW wireless systems have been implemented at Ka-band, i. e., 35 GHz, {{where they can be}} directly extended from the traditional microwave systems. However, as the frequency increases to W-band, such as 77 GHz and 95 GHz, RF engineers encounter nontrivial challenges from various technical aspects. In a general sense, the most critical part of wireless communication, radar, and radiometry systems is the receiver. Despite the different mechanisms and applications of these receivers, {{it should be noted that}} they have similar front-end components, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>antennas,</b> pre-amplifiers, and filters. Assembling these components can achieve a front-end receiving module, which could potentially be utilized in most wireless systems. To this end, I present my work on the development of a W-band front-end receiving module, consisting of a high-gain antenna, high-gain low noise amplifiers, bandpass filters, transmission lines, and their transitions for interconnection. To minimize the dielectric loss, liquid crystal polymer (LCP) is selected as the module substrate, which has a low loss tangent and low dielectric constant at W-band. To achieve high density, light weight, low profile, and low power consumption, the proposed module is designed on a multilayer circuit. The multilayer circuit is fabricated using the commercial state-of-the-art large-panel circuit print technologies, achieving low unit price and short manufacturing cycle. Multi-chip module packaging technologies have been developed to achieve a net gain of more than 50 dB for the proposed module, while maintaining linear phase and low electromagnetic interference. By using the state-of-the-art low noise amplifiers, the noise figure of the module can be minimized below 6 dB at W-band, which can satisfy most wireless receiving applications. The designed antenna, transitions between various transmission lines, low noise amplifies, and developed integration and packaging technologies achieve an ultra-wide bandwidth that covers most of the frequencies in the W-band, providing sufficient bandwidth for gigabyte data transmission rates in wireless communication systems. For narrow-band applications, i. e., radiometry and frequency division multiplexing, the designed filters and directional filters can be utilized to pick out the frequencies of interest. In conclusion, the proposed front-end receiving module may find many applications in various wireless systems at W-band, i. e., wireless communication, radar, and radiometry.

40|$|The GNSS {{signals are}} an {{important}} active source for Earth's remote sensing in L band. Experiments performed over sea and land surfaces demonstrated the capability of GNSS-Reflected signals (GNSS-R) for remote sensing purposes. Presently, many research groups are focusing their efforts in developing GNSS-R sensors for soil moisture, sea, sea-ice, and snow cover monitoring. Applications like drought monitoring, farm production, irrigation planning, flood protection, fire prevention, and meteorological forecasts can take advantage from retrieved soil moisture content. Detected sea-surface winds could help to identify adverse meteorological conditions far from coastal zones. Sea altimetry measurements {{could be used to}} monitor tides and to identify natural hazards (i. e. tsunamis). Sea-ice topographic changes in the Arctic and Antarctic regions and dry ice stratification could be monitored in order to improve polar climatology knowledge. Recently the Remote Sensing Group of Politecnico of Turin and NavSAS laboratory of ISMB (Istituto Superiore Mario Boella) starts the design and implementation of a fully reconfigurable GNSS-R instrument for research activities, following a Software Defined Radio approach. Using this solution, the hardware is reduced to the RF stages only (i. <b>e.</b> <b>antennas,</b> demodulation, sampling) and the processing starts from the IF (Intermediate Frequency) samples of the raw signal. This is a low-cost portable observing system, designed to be easily placed for example also on board small aircrafts (also unmanned). In this sense, the system components were carefully chosen to minimize size and weight of the complete observing system. Together with the system definition, a user interface is started to be developed. Actually the interface allows a quasi real time control of the received signal. The correct estimation of the whole correlation function profile (in range and frequency space) is achieved by keeping the noise level as low as possible and increasing the SNR. Therefore, it is important to optimally process signals even when long - non coherent integration time is necessary. The interface we developed is able to process such signals using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) based acquisition algorithms. In addition, an optimized procedure is implemented to compensate for a residual code delay, enhancing the detection of weak signals. The interface allows also experimental activities planning, since it shows specular reflection points and isorange lines (inside receiver antenna's footprint), computed knowing estimated or predicted satellite positions. All the information are georeferenced using UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinate system and projected on Google© static maps. Thus, this user friendly interface is a helpful tool able to generate all the necessary output for the geophysical applications performed exploiting GNSS-R signals. In order to test instrument and interface, some experimental activities were recently done by placing the instrument on a high cliff to collect some looks from the sea surface and on board an aircraft to collects measurements from soil reflections (rice fields water flooding, soil moisture, altimetry). Another important activity is to adapt our GNSS-R system for space-based measurements in the framework of an educational project which is being carried out by students belonging to the Aerospace and ICT Engineering faculties of Politecnico of Turin. This student project is going to be developed in the framework of an initiative offered by the Education Office of the European Space Agency. We are trying to design and develop on a system level a space-based test bed for an Earth's Remote Sensing payload to be placed on-board a small Cubesat. This is the P-GRESSION payload (Payload for GNSS REmote Sensing and Signal detectION). It will try to demonstrate the feasibility of existing applications based on observations normally carr...|$|E
