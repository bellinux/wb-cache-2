5|$|Forts Monroe and Wool {{gave the}} Union forces {{control of the}} {{entrance}} to Hampton Roads. The blockade, initiated on April 30, 1861, cut off Norfolk and Richmond from the sea almost completely. To further the blockade, the Union Navy stationed {{some of its most}} powerful warships in the roadstead. There, they were under the shelter of the shore-based guns of Fort Monroe and the batteries at Hampton and Newport News and out of the range of the guns at Sewell's Point and Craney Island. For most of {{the first year of the}} war, the Confederacy could <b>do</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> oppose or dislodge them.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide fibers {{are used}} to measure gas {{temperatures}} in an optical technique called thin filament pyrometry. It involves the placement of a thin filament in a hot gas stream. Radiative emissions from the filament can be correlated with filament temperature. Filaments are SiC fibers with a diameter of 15 micrometers, about one fifth that of a human hair. Because the fibers are so thin, they <b>do</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> disturb the flame and their temperature remains close {{to that of the}} local gas. Temperatures of about 800–2500 K can be measured.|$|E
5|$|The western slopes fall {{smoothly}} to {{the head}} of Thirlmere reservoir, and the tiny church at Wythburn. There are rougher areas, High and Comb Crags in particular, but these <b>do</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> change the overall impression of high moorland. The lower slopes have been planted with conifers as part of the Thirlmere Forest, but above this is a sense of wide open space. Nethermost Pike's toehold on the valley is shifted a little to the south, relative to its position on the ridge. This is because Whelpside and Birkside Gills, its boundary streams, both run south-west, rather than flowing straight down the slope.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained {{open for the}} Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, to bring in supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial forces could <b>do</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information {{about what was happening}} in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{people could}} <b>do</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} eating the insects {{may have been}} some consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden had pointed out, {{there was a}} lot at stake. The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could <b>do</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E

5|$|The Comanches {{operated}} as {{an autonomous}} power inside the area claimed by Spain but not controlled by it. The Comanches used their military power to obtain supplies and labor from the Mexicans, and Indians through thievery, tribute, and kidnappings, and the Spanish could <b>do</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> stop {{them because the}} Comanches controlled most of the horses {{in the region and}} thus had more wealth and mobility. Although powered by violence, the Comanche empire was primarily an economic construction, rooted in an extensive commercial network that facilitated long-distance trade. Dealing with subordinate Indians, the Comanche spread their language and culture across the region. In terms of governance, the Comanches created a centralized political system, based on a foraging market economy, and a hierarchical social organization.|$|E
5|$|Tyler's {{political}} fortunes were growing; he {{was considered}} as a possible candidate in the legislative deliberation for the 1824 U.S. Senate election. He was nominated in December 1825 for governor of Virginia, a position which was then appointed by the legislature. Tyler was elected 131–81 over John Floyd. The office of governor was powerless under the original Virginia Constitution (1776–1830), lacking even veto authority. Tyler enjoyed a prominent oratorical platform but could <b>do</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> influence the legislature. His most visible act as governor was delivering the funeral address for former president Jefferson, a Virginian, who had died on July 4, 1826. Tyler was deeply devoted to Jefferson, and his eloquent eulogy was well received.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could <b>do</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that someone in a position of power was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E

5|$|In May 1945, all German {{troops in}} Norway {{came under the}} command of the Twentieth Mountain Army, which had absorbed the Army Norway on 18 December 1944. It was {{commanded}} by General Franz Böhme, who had succeeded General Lothar Rendulic as Armed Forces Commander, Norway in January 1945. At the beginning of May, Böhme informed Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Naval High Command and the new German president, with the death of Adolf Hitler, that all forces in Norway consisted of eleven divisions and five brigades. In total, they had a combined strength of between 350,000 and 380,000 troops. There were also a number of U-boats stationed in naval bases in Norway, including 10 Mark XXI and 17 Mark XXIII models. Yet although Allied forces had entered Germany, and rumours and speculation were rife about a possible invasion of Norway, the Twentieth Mountain Army almost seemed to be at a peace-time status; Böhme had complained in January that there were some units in the Army that took Sunday off as a holiday, and that he could <b>do</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> stop it.|$|E
5|$|The War of the American Independence saw {{a series}} of {{military}} manoeuvres and battles involving naval forces of the British Royal Navy and the Continental Navy from 1775, and of the French Navy from 1778 onwards. These culminated in the surrender of the British Army force of Lieutenant-General Earl Charles Cornwallis, an event that led directly {{to the beginning of}} serious peace negotiations and the eventual end of the war. From the start of the hostilities, the British North American station under Vice-Admiral Samuel Graves blockaded the major colonial ports and carried raids agaynst patriot communities. Colonial forces could <b>do</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> stop these developments due to British naval supremacy. In 1777, colonial privateers made raids into British waters capturing merchant ships, which they took into French and Spanish ports, although both were officially neutral. Seeking to challenge Britain, France signed two treaties with America in February 1778, but stopped short of declaring war on Britain. The risk of a French invasion forced the British to concentrate its forces in the English Channel, leaving its forces in North America vulnerable to attacks.|$|E
