5|$|Entering the 85th United States Congress, McGovern {{became a}} member of the House Committee on Education and Labor. As a representative, McGovern was {{attentive}} to his district. He became a staunch supporter of higher commodity prices, <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> supports, grain storage programs, and beef import controls, believing that such stored commodities programs guarded against drought and similar emergencies. He favored rural development, federal aid to small business and to education, and medical coverage for the aged under Social Security. In 1957, he traveled and studied conditions in the Middle East under a fellowship from the American Christian Palestine Committee. McGovern first allied with the Kennedy family by supporting a House version of Senator John F. Kennedy's eventually unsuccessful labor reform bill.|$|E

Through his own initiative, he directed all Federal agencies to accelerate their procurement and construction, particularly in labor surplus areas. A long-range program of post office construction was compressed into {{the first six months}} of his presidency, <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> supports were raised and their payments advanced, over a billion dollars in state highway aid funds were released ahead of schedule, and the distribution of tax refunds and GI life insurance dividends were sped up. In addition, free food distribution to needy families was expanded, state governors were urged by Kennedy to spend federal funds more rapidly for hospitals, schools, roads, and waste treatment facilities, the college housing and urban renewal programs were pushed forward, and procurement agencies were directed to make purchases in areas of high unemployment.|$|E

Their dispute pitted East against Midwest, city against countryside, internationalist against isolationist, pragmatic liberals against principled conservatives. Each man thought himself the genuine spokesman of the future; each denounced {{the other as}} a political heretic." [...] In a 1949 speech, Dewey criticized Taft and his followers by saying that [...] "we have in our party some fine, high-minded patriotic people who honestly oppose <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> supports, unemployment insurance, old age benefits, slum clearance, and other social programs... these people believe in a laissez-faire society and look back wistfully to the miscalled 'good old days' of the nineteenth century... if such efforts {{to turn back the}} clock are actually pursued, you can bury the Republican Party as the deadest pigeon in the country." [...] He added that people who opposed such social programs should [...] "go out and try to get elected in a typical American community and see what happens to them. But they ought not to do it as Republicans." ...|$|E

Using the autoregressive distributed lag model and bounds testing procedure, a long-run relationship between feed and <b>farm</b> <b>prices</b> and their determinants was confirmed. Given the effect of corn and soybean meal prices on catfish feed prices, and catfish fish feed <b>prices</b> on <b>farm</b> <b>prices,</b> the long-run responsiveness of feed prices to a percentage increase in U. S. ethanol production is 0. 325, and the responsiveness of catfish <b>farm</b> <b>prices</b> is 0. 064. Although both feed and <b>farm</b> <b>prices</b> increase with ethanol production, the relatively small responsiveness of <b>farm</b> <b>prices</b> when compared with feed prices suggests that catfish farmers are worse off.

2500|$|Science-fiction {{writer and}} critic James Blish, writing in 1957, shortly after publication, criticized {{the lack of}} {{characterization}} of its hero Dan Davis, saying, [...] "It is surely an odd novel that is at its best when the author is openly editorializing...." [...] — in this case about the [...] "parity system of <b>farm</b> <b>price</b> supports, which in 2000 is applied to automobiles. ... Every other important subject of science fiction which Heinlein has examined at length has come out remade, vitalized and made the author's own property. [...] It didn't happen here, {{for the first time}} in Heinlein's long and distinguished career — and not because Heinlein didn't have something to say, but because he failed to embody it in a real protagonist. [...] Evidently, Heinlein as his own hero is about played out." [...] Floyd C. Gale was more positive in his 1957 review, comparing the book to The Sleeper Awakes and writing that [...] "Heinlein paints a detailed picture of both civilizations, so evocative that 1970 emerges clearly in the reader's mind as the old days, and pretty primitive at that ... Of course you'll like Heinlein's latest". The critic Alexei Panshin, writing in 1968, said that [...] "as a whole, the story is thoroughly melodramatic but very good fun. ... It was as though Heinlein the engineer said, 'If I had the parts available, what little gadgets would I most enjoy building?' and then went ahead and built them fictionally.

5000|$|Mayer {{argues that}} {{scholars}} have given {{too much emphasis}} on the civil rights issue; it was not the only deciding factor for Southern white voters.

Mayer states: Goldwater's staff also realized that his radical plan to sell the Tennessee Valley Authority was causing even racist whites to vote for Johnson. A Florida editorial urged Southern whites not to support Goldwater even if they agreed with his position on civil rights, because his other positions would have grave economic consequences for the region.
