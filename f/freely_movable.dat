5|$|Ultima Underworld II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{that takes place}} from a character's eye view in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The player's goal is to adventure through dungeon-like indoor environments across eight parallel dimensions, while completing quests to help the inhabitants of each world. The player uses a <b>freely</b> <b>movable</b> mouse cursor {{to interact with the}} game's world and to manipulate the heads-up display (HUD) interface. Icons on the HUD allow the player to examine objects closely, to converse with non-player characters (NPCs) and to ready the player character's weapon, among other things. During the game, the player collects items and stores them in an inventory on the HUD. Because it uses the same engine as its predecessor, Ultima Underworld II shares many of that game's features. For example, it allows the player character to jump and swim, and it contains an automap.|$|E
5|$|Ultima Underworld is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} (RPG) {{that takes place}} from a first-person perspective in a three-dimensional environment. The player's goal is to adventure through a large, multi-level dungeon, in which the entire game is set. The player uses a <b>freely</b> <b>movable</b> mouse cursor {{to interact with the}} game's world, and with the icon-based interface on the heads-up display (HUD). Each icon has a specific effect; for example, the Look icon allows the player to examine objects closely, while the Fight icon causes the player character to ready his or her weapon. The player's progression through the game is non-linear: areas may be explored, and puzzles and quests finished, in any order. An automatically filling map, to which the player may add notes, records what the player has seen above a minimum level of brightness. The player character may carry light sources to extend the line of sight in varying amounts. Exploratory actions include looking up and down, jumping, and swimming.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of commissioning, the conference {{compartment}} was equipped with a large table, four <b>freely</b> <b>movable</b> chairs, an electronic typewriter, a fax machine, a telephone and power sockets. It could be used with a reservation {{of at least three}} seats. Originally, first-class tickets were necessary. If there were no reservations in the conference compartment, it could be used at the head conductor's discretion. In 1992, demand was high: the conference compartments were booked 8197 times. A year later, that number dropped to 4400. Before the refurbishment program, the train's only power sockets for passengers were located in the conference compartment.|$|E

A plurality of outlets such as registers or auxiliary or branch ducts communicate with the supply duct and valve means are disposed in the supply duct at {{at least some of}} the outlets for automatically channelling a controllable amount of air from the supply duct to the associated outlet regardless of the direction of air flow within the supply duct. The valve means comprises an automatic air volume control apparatus for distribution within the air supply duct into which air may be introduced from two opposite directions. The apparatus incorporates a <b>freely</b> swinging <b>movable</b> vane in the supply duct to automatically channel into the associated outlet only the deflected air flow which has the higher relative pressure...|$|R
25|$|The {{trochanter}} is the basal {{segment of}} the telopodite; {{it is always a}} small segment in the insect leg, <b>freely</b> <b>movable</b> by a horizontal hinge on the coxa, but more or less fixed {{to the base of the}} femur. When movable on the femur the trochantero femoral hinge is usually vertical or oblique in a vertical plane, giving a slight movement of production and reduction at the joint, though only a reductor muscle is present. In the Odonata, both nymphs and adults, there are two trochanteral segments, but they are not movable on each other; the second contains the reductor muscle of the femur. The usual single trochanteral segment of insects, therefore, probably represents the two trochanters of other arthropods fused into one apparent segment, since it is not likely that the primary coxotrochanteral hinge has been lost from the leg. In some of the Hymenoptera a basal subdivision of the femur simulates a second trochanter, but the insertion of the reductor muscle on its base attests that it belongs to the femoral segment, since as shown in the odonate leg, the reductor has its origin in the true second trochanter.|$|E
25|$|The tarsus {{of insects}} {{corresponds}} to the penultimate segment of a generalized arthropod limb, which is the segment called the propodite in Crustacea. adult insects it is commonly subdivided into from two to five subsegments, or tarsomeres, but in the Protura, some Collembola, and most holometabolous insect larvae it preserves the primitive form of a simple segment. The subsegments of the adult insect tarsus are usually <b>freely</b> <b>movable</b> on one another by inflected connecting membranes, but the tarsus never has intrinsic muscles. The tarsus of adult pterygote insects having fewer than five subsegments is probably specialized {{by the loss of}} one or more subsegments or by a fusion of adjoining subsegments. In the tarsi of Acrididae the long basal piece is evidently composed of three united tarsomeres, leaving the fourth and the fifth. The basal tarsomere is sometimes conspicuously enlarged and is distinguished as the basitarsus. On the under surfaces of the tarsal subsegments in certain Orthoptera there are small pads, the tarsal pulvilli, or euplantulae. The tarsus is occasionally fused with the tibia in larval insects, forming a tibiotarsal segment; in some cases it appears to be eliminated or reduced to a rudiment between the tibia and the pretarsus.|$|E

500|$|Criticism {{was aimed}} at the game's camera angles, which Eurogamer felt were [...] "idiotic" [...] at times, giving the example of boss fights in which the camera centers on the boss rather than being <b>freely</b> <b>movable.</b> Allgame {{found that it was}} hard to form an {{emotional}} bond with Ratchet & Clanks main characters, saying that Ratchet is [...] "your typical teenager [...] who desires nothing more than excitement and adventure" [...] and that Clank is [...] "the stereotypical intellectual; stuffy and almost prudish to a fault", feeling instead that the characters of Jak and Daxter from Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy were [...] "infinitely more likeable." [...] Some criticisms were also aimed at the story, with GameSpy saying that the game became predictable, boring, and [...] "just bland". Reviewers also noted that {{the first half of the}} game was [...] "yawn inducing", but once the player reaches planet Rilgar, it becomes much more intense and difficult; GamePro found that the player does not [...] "engage a single thought process" [...] for the first parts of the game.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lighting}} for {{the tour}} was done by UK lighting company HSL, which also supplied the crew. HSL previously worked with the band for their tours in 2006 & 2007. The lighting on the tour {{is based on the}} concept of [...] "creative synergy", which employs four visual mediums – lighting, digital lighting, video and movement. The initial ideas came from the band itself, who pitched them to Davy Sherwin, lighting & visuals director. Sherwin had previously worked with the band on their tours in 2006 & 2007. He came up with a simple arrangement of LED and moving lights, which he felt went well with the music of the album. A metalwork layout of five trusses running upstage/downstage was then added, referring [...] "sun rays" [...] from the album title. The trusses are hinged down at upstage end, so they are <b>freely</b> <b>movable</b> into the performance area. After the design was finalized, Sherwin started to program the show on an ESP Vision visualizer system. He then recorded every song onto a hard drive, and made QuickTime movies of the lighting scenes. These were used by Robin Haddow (live visuals director) and Blue Leach (video director) to program the screen looks, colors and effects, referring to Sherwin's cues. They rehearsed the show for six days at Wembley Arena. In live concerts, Sherwin, Haddow and Leach work together to ensure all four cues (lighting, digital lighting, video and movement) work properly. Sherwin and Haddow operate two WholeHog 3 consoles each, and Rupert Reynolds works the Kinesys system, which produces the effects. The tour is the first ever to use Barco's digital moving lights.|$|E

50|$|Skin {{tumors are}} less common in cats; and {{although}} most cats are vulnerable, white cats are especially prone {{to this type}} of tumor. Feline skin tumor manifests as a visible lump on the skin, mostly affecting vision, smell, or eating.

The only indicator of benign tumors is self-trauma, which can be caused by excessive licking by the cat.|$|E
50|$|The legs {{consist of}} coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, metatarsus, tarsus and claw. In most Eupnoi and many Dyspnoi the coxae are <b>freely</b> <b>movable,</b> while in others they are fused {{together}} and immovably {{attached to the}} underside of the body. In contrast to spiders, hydraulic pressure plays no significant role in leg movement. However, a flexed leg of Leiobunum returned 80% of its energy by extending. This springlike property is caused by sclerites that span across the joints, which probably consist of resilin.|$|E
