25|$|The {{share is}} {{the cutting edge}} of the {{moldboard}} plow. The share makes the horizontal cut that separates the furrow slice from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional shares have points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of field experience, penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A plough body with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full working depth. The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing the plow to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; it literally sucks the plow into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has <b>horizontal</b> <b>suction,</b> which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while <b>horizontal</b> <b>suction</b> causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on heavy soil with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (trapezium, diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the moldboard to reduce the pulverizing action of the soil.|$|E

The hangers are mounted with screws and are pre-attached to the floor elements at manufacturing. This arrangement makes {{the design of the}} hanger critical with respect to safety and load transfer redundancy, since the screws transfer all the loads, both withdrawal and shear forces can act simultaneously. Tests have been carried out to examine the structural behaviour of the hanger. The two most critical load cases, vertical floor load and <b>horizontal</b> wind <b>suction</b> load, and three different screw joint configurations were investigated. The results indicate that the vertical distance between the screw joint and the upper edge of the rim beam should be increased and that withdrawal forces on the screws should be kept as low as possible. Some suggestions for improving the present design are given and a modified design is proposed to enhance the load-bearing capacity and to improve the overall safety and redundancyGodkänd; 2012; 20121205 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} two-dimensional, {{steady-state}} film condensation on an isothermal <b>horizontal</b> disk with <b>suction</b> at the porous wall is studied {{for the case}} in which a cold plate faces upward. The dimensionless film thickness along the disk is found to be a function of parameter Ja/Pr (Jakob number/Prandtl number) and the suction parameter Sw. An essential part of the present analysis is the use of the condition that the boundary layer depth at the disk edge is equal to a critical(minimum) depth. The dimensionless heat transfer coefficients are also found to be functions of parameters Ja/Pr and Ra/Ja. Furthermore, the dimensionless heat transfer coefficient increases as suction parameter Sw increases...|$|R

40|$|In {{refrigeration}} systems a {{small amount}} of compressor lubricant is entrained in the refrigerant and circulated through the system, where some is retained in each component. The suction line to the compressor has the largest potential for oil retention. This paper presents results from an experimental apparatus that has been constructed to circulate POE (polyolester) oil and R 410 A at a controlled mass flux, OCR (oil in circulation ratio), and apparent superheat, and to directly measure the pressure drop and mass of oil retained in horizontal and vertical suction lines. The bulk vapor velocity and overall void fraction are determined from direct mass and temperature measurements. The oil retention, pressure drop, and flow regimes near the minimum ASHRAE recommended mass flux condition are explored. It was found that oil retention begins to increase sharply even above the minimum recommended flux, so conditions near the minimum should be avoided. Two relationships were developed to predict the oil retention in the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>suction</b> lines. The average error from the predictions method was 10. 9 % for the vertical tube, and 7. 9 % for the horizontal tube...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{trials in}} Cairns, Australia, to examine if novel updraft light traps collected significantly more mosquitoes than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) model 512 miniature light trap. Two new updraft traps, the Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy (NAQS) Mozzie Trap and a CDC updraft trap, both collected significantly more mosquitoes {{than the standard}} CDC light trap, with a mean CDC Trap Index (trap collections relative to paired standard CDC light trap collections) of 3. 3 and 2. 3, respectively. These traps both had large <b>horizontal</b> <b>suction</b> areas that increased the probability that attracted mosquitoes entered the trap updraft. However, if the CO 2 source was located within the updraft of the CDC updraft trap, mosquito collections decreased considerably, indicating that placement of the bait is critical to trap performance. Creating an updraft by simply inverting the CDC trap body did not increase collections. The Mosquito Magnet X trap also did not collect significantly more mosquitoes than the CDC trap. Two CDC light traps sharing a 600 ml CO 2 /min gas line collected ca. 50 % more mosquitoes than a single CDC trap baited with 600 ml CO 2 /min, suggesting that a single gas source could be used on a trap line consisting of multiple trap units. These {{studies suggest that the}} optimal trap design should incorporate a CO 2 release system that lures mosquitoes to a large updraft within a bowl-shaped trap intake...|$|E

40|$|LectureUsers of {{standard}} production model centrifugal pumps are frequently faces {{with the task}} of evaluation a group of very competitive bids. A thorough evaluation will involve both technical and commercial aspects of the submittals. As energy cost increase, the commercial value of a pump?s hydraulic efficiency becomes more significant. The vendor?s characteristic curve typically shows efficiencies which can be used to estimate power costs for a particular pump. Frequently, the type of pump discussed in this paper is a key component in a refinery or chemical process. Mechanical ruggedness may be more important than efficiency. This paper reviews some of the technical evaluation methods available to the user. The mechanical components of a <b>horizontal</b> end <b>suction</b> centrifugal pump are subjected to various hydraulic and/or mechanical forces. A determination of the magnitude and direction of such forces at various points along the characteristic curve permits further evaluation of the pump?s mechanical design for operation at best efficiency, minimum flow, runout, etc. An understanding of the principals involved herein should assist the user both in the initial equipment selection as well as troubleshooting after installation.

40|$|The {{flow and}} heat-transfer {{characteristics}} over a continuously moving <b>horizontal</b> material with <b>suction</b> or injection are studied very close {{and far away}} downstream from the extrusion slit. The ®nite-volume method is used to map out the solutions in the nonsimilar and similar regions subject to uniform surface velocity and temperature. The e ects of Prandtl number (Pr), suction/injection parameter (d) and Reynolds number (Rex) on the friction and heat-transfer coe cients are studied. Comparisons with the similarity method solutions downstream at high Rex are made. Critical Reynolds numbers {{to distinguish between the}} self-similar and nonsimilar regions are obtained. The region very close to the slit is characterized by: (i) a rapid increase in skin-friction coe cient with increasing suction, or with increasing injection above d 0. 45; the lowest friction coe cient is attained at an injection parameter d 0. 45, and (ii) large heat-transfer coe cient which increases with increasing Prandtl number and suction, and decreases with increasing injection. On the other hand, downstream where the similarity solution is valid both the skin-friction and heattransfer coe cients reach asymptotic values depending on d and, for the latter, on Pr.

40|$|Fish {{execute a}} C start when they escape from a predator. Previous {{studies suggest that}} fish {{randomize}} their horizontal escape trajectories, but bias the response away from the stimulus. The fewstudies that looked at the vertical trajectory found that fish larvae respond to a horizontal stimulus with a downward escape trajectory. This study quantifies the escape trajectories of fish larvae in three dimensions. We use a vertical and a <b>horizontal</b> <b>suction</b> stimulus to explore the effect of stimulus direction on the escape trajectory. We found that zebrafish larvae (age 3 to 12 days post-fertilization) consistently responded to a horizontal stimulus with a downward trajectory. For the horizontal stimulus, out of 70 video recordings, 54 showed escape responses (77. 1 %). Fifty twoof those responses showed a downwards trajectory (96. 3 %). Thesedata suggestthat the same trend holds true when we use a vertical stimulus, simulating a benthic predator. The vertical stimulus, out of 131 video recordings, 131 showed escape responses (100 %). From those responses, 129 showeda downwards trajectory (98. 8 %). Given the age range of the larvae, the downward trajectory cannot be explained by asymmetry of the body due {{to the presence of}} a yolk sac; the yolksac is absorbed usually at age 5 to 6 days. So the downward trajectory might be a hardwired response (zebrafish larvae are demersal) or indicate that fish have less control over their pitch than their yaw angle ???the body movements during an escape response might be able to generate a wide range of yawing moments, but not pitching moments, leading to the observed bias in the trajectories...|$|E
40|$|In {{most of the}} {{refrigeration}} systems a small {{quantity of}} oil is carried out of the compressor by high velocity vapor leaving the compressor discharge {{in the form of}} a mixture with the refrigerant. The circulating liquid which is a mixture of oil and refrigerant has the highest viscosity in the suction line to the compressor due to which it has the highest potential for oil retention. R 1234 yf is a new alternative refrigerant of low global warming potential (GWP) which has been developed for automobile air conditioners as a drop-in replacement for R 134 a in order to meet European Union???s low GWP requirement. A quantitative comparison of oil retention and pressure drop characteristics of R 1234 yf and R 134 a with POE 32 oil in 10. 2 mm inside diameter <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>suction</b> lines at saturation temperature of 13 oC with 15 oC of superheat is presented. The effect of pipe inclination on oil retention was also investigated. High speed videos of the flow were taken to relate flow regimes to the oil retention data. Test results show that for same system cooling capacity, R 1234 yf and R 134 a have very similar oil retention; however, the use of R 1234 yf results in 20 - 30 % higher pressure drop. It was also found that inclined suction lines retain more oil than vertical lines. A semi-empirical model for prediction of oil retention and pressure drop in vertical suction lines in annular flow regime is presented. The model predicts 90 % of the oil retention and pressure drop within ?? 20 % and ?? 30 % of the experimental data. The model is used to propose a new criterion for minimum refrigerant mass flux which could be useful as an improved guideline for sizing of vertical suction lines...|$|R
40|$|A partir de résultats expérimentaux, des équations d'infiltration et de continuité, nous avons établi une équation {{permettant}} de prédire la profondeur maximale humidifiée par un goutteur à la surface du sol. Connaissant l'humidité initiale du sol Øi, la conductivité hydraulique Kf et la {{teneur en eau}} au niveau du front Øi; l'équation établie permet de calculer la profondeur du front d'humectation Zf(t) à partir du suivi du rayon du front d'humectation Rf(t) à la surface du sol. Pour tester la validité de cette nouvelle approche, des essais ont été menés sur deux types de sol (sableux et limono-argileux) et avec trois débits différents. Les valeurs de Zf(t) mesurées (par deux techniques différentes) ont été comparées à celles calculées par cette équation, les résultats étaient, dans tous les cas, quasi-identiques (coefficient de corrélation R 2, dans tous les cas, supérieur ou égal à 0. 94). In trickle irrigation, the wetted soil volume fraction (P) is a fundamental parameter for both network design and irrigation scheduling. However, methods used to determine such parameter (P) are still limited and unaccurate. Further, numerical models established for predicting wetted soil volume (or bulb) dimensions remain onerous, complex, expensive, and therefore hardly used. Experimental and numerical results performed on water infiltration from point source on the soil surface show a close relationship between the horizontal and vertical bulb dimensions. This study {{which was based on}} continuity and cumulative infiltration equations allowed to establish a new and simple equation for predicting wetted soil depth. This equation enables, knowing initial and wetting front water content and K(hf) (soil hydraulic conductivity on the wetting front), to calculate the front depth Zf(t) beneath a point source with only measuring the front radius Rf(t) on the soil surface. The established equation verifies physical conditions of axisymmetric water infiltration into the soil. The established equation was tested by performing trials on two different soil types and three discharge rates. Two different procedures were simultaneously used for determining Rf(t) and Zf(t). i) observing bulb dimensions evolution on the soil surface and along the symmetry axis. ii) Rf(t) and Zf(t) values were inferred from the <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>suction</b> profiles respectively. The Zf(t) values calculated, using such equation, are compared with those measured. The results obtained showed good agreement between calculated and measured data (R 2 >= 0. 94).
