5|$|Cameron and Comfort {{participated in}} a {{televised}} debate with atheists Brian Sapient and Kelly O'Conner of the Rational Response Squad, at Calvary Baptist Church, in Manhattan, on May 5, 2007. It was moderated by ABC's Martin Bashir and parts of it were aired on Nightline. At issue was the existence of God, which Comfort stated he could prove scientifically, without relying on faith or the Bible. The audience was composed of both theists and atheists. Points of discussion included atheism and evolution. While Sapient contended during his arguments that Comfort violated the rules by talking about the Ten Commandments, Cameron later stated on The Way of the Master radio show that {{the rules of the}} debate <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the Bible could never be referenced, but rather that Comfort simply {{had to come up with}} one argument that did not reference the Bible or faith.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{response}} was delayed because telephones {{inside the building}} could not be used. The plant owner's son drove to the fire station and informed them there that the factory was on fire but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> workers {{were still in the}} plant. More than 100 medical and emergency service personnel went to the scene, some of whom ran from a local hospital, and nearby towns provided emergency evacuation for the injured via four air ambulances from the local hospital to nearby burns units.|$|E
25|$|I {{have learned}} {{that many of the}} Greeks believe Pythagoras said all things are {{generated}} from number. The very assertion poses a difficulty: How can things which do not exist even be conceived to generate? But he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> all things come to be from number; rather, in accordance with number – on the grounds that order in the primary sense is in number and it is by participation in order that a first and a second and the rest sequentially are assigned to things which are counted.|$|E

25|$|In Washington v. Harper, the {{individual}} protesting the involuntary medication was already incarcerated. The Court suggested {{in this case}} that a competent person has the right to refuse if the medication is administered for other than treatment reasons to a person not dangerous or extremely ill, but it accepted the institution's procedures for making such treatment decisions. However, Riggins was not convicted {{at the time he was}} involuntarily medicated. In Riggins v. Nevada, the Court said that not only had the medication to be a medically appropriate means of attaining an important state objective such as competency, but the medication must be the least intrusive means of attaining the objective. However, although the treatment must be the least intrusive (for example, to allow {{the individual}} to retain a clear head to consult with his attorney as well as to avoid medication side effects), the court <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> involuntary medication is never appropriate to achieve the state's goal.|$|E
25|$|Seedman {{established}} himself as a detective during the 1960s. As the detective commander for Brooklyn, he once oversaw an investigation of a shooting death, in which over 2,000 people were interviewed, that turned out to have been a freak accident. He investigated many prominent crimes during that era, including the Borough Park Tobacco robbery and the Kitty Genovese murder. As the chief of detective he reformed that branch by assigning detectives to specialize in certain areas of crime rather than just investigating whatever cases came their way when they were on shift. His tenure as chief of detectives of the city was short but memorable, marked by the Knapp Commission's corruption investigations which briefly cost him his job, several mob hits and terror attacks carried out by the Black Liberation Army (BLA). When his superior officers hindered his investigation into the murder of an officer at a Harlem mosque out of fear of a race riot, Seedman resigned his position and retired from the force, although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> had been the reason for another 40 years.|$|E
25|$|At the Fatal Accident Inquiry held in Banff in February 1972 Adam Watson was {{the chief}} expert witness for the Crown. It emerged that the consent form issued to parents <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> winter {{mountaineering}} was involved. Also, {{only one of the}} parents had been told the outing was going to be to the Cairngorms. The Inquiry reported that the deaths had been due to cold and exposure. It recommended (1) there should be special regard for fitness and training, (2) parents should be given fuller information about outdoor activities, (3) parties should be led by fully qualified instructors and accompanied by certified teachers, (4) suitable locations for summer and winter expeditions should be identified in consultation with mountaineering organisations, (5) experts should advise on whether high-level shelters should be removed, (6) the mountain rescue teams were praised and consideration should be given to supporting the teams financially and generally, (7) following any future disaster there should be closer liaison between authorities and parents. The jury did not want to discourage future adventurous outdoor activities. The advocate for the parents suggested that the overall leader of the expedition and the principal of Lagganlia should be found at fault but the Inquiry did not make any finding of fault.|$|E

500|$|Till's {{murder was}} the focus of a 1957 {{television}} episode for the U.S. Steel Hour titled [...] "Noon on Doomsday" [...] written by Rod Serling. He was fascinated by how quickly Mississippi whites supported Bryant and Milam. Although the script was rewritten to avoid mention of Till, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the murder victim was black, White Citizens' Councils vowed to boycott U.S. Steel. The eventual episode bore little resemblance to the Till case.|$|E
500|$|Gasaway {{disagreed}} {{that the}} Whigs deceived the voters, [...] "The 'fable' of 1840 {{tells us that}} the Whigs triumphed over baffled and listless Democrats by convincing voters that Harrison lived in a log cabin and that he was a great war hero when, so the legend goes, neither claim was true. [...] Whigs <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Harrison lived in a log cabin and in fact went into great detail describing his actual house. The 'log cabin' was much more symbol than claim." [...] Gasaway suggested that the 1840 campaign gained a poor reputation because Harrison and the Whig Party soon vanished from the scene, and many of those who had supported both in 1840 saw the election as a squandered opportunity: [...] "Add to this the fact that the poor man died only thirty days into an administration launched by what was perhaps the most exciting election campaign in the nation's history up to that time and we are confronted... with an undeniable and almost irresistible touch of opera bouffé." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{struggle}} continued {{even after}} this point. The Interregnum granted some respite to the Common Pleas, which abolished fines on original writs, hurting the King's Bench, but in 1660 the fines were reinstated and [...] "then the very attorneys of the Common Pleas boggled {{at them and}} carried all their finable business to the King's Bench". In 1661 the Common Pleas attempted to reverse this by pushing for an Act of Parliament to abolish latitats based on legal fictions, forbidding [...] "special bail" [...] in any case where [...] "the true cause of action" [...] was not expressed in the process. The King's Bench got around this in the 1670s; the Act <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the process had to be true, so the court continued to use legal fictions, simply ensuring that the true cause of action was expressed in the process, {{regardless of whether or}} not it was correct. The Bill of Middlessex disclosed the true cause of action, satisfying the 1661 statute, but did not require a valid complaint. This caused severe friction within the court system, and Francis North, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, eventually reached a compromise by allowing such legal fictions in the Common Pleas as well as the King's Bench.|$|E
500|$|Nearly a {{month before}} the {{ceremony}} Rock told Josh Wolk of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Come on, it's a fashion show. No one performs; it's not like a music show. What straight black man sits there and watches the Oscars? Show me one." [...] Political blogger Matt Drudge later reported that several anonymous AMPAS members wanted Rock fired from his hosting job {{as a result of the}} comments. Nevertheless, producer Cates issued a statement defending the host saying, [...] "Chris' comments are meant to be humorous digs at a show that some people, obviously including Chris himself, think may be a bit too stuffy." [...] Furthermore, Wolk dismissed any controversy regarding Rock's comments and that Drudge exaggerated the host's comments. GLAAD Executive Director Joan Garry also issue a statement in light of the controversy stating, [...] "Chris Rock isn't making fun of gays [...] he's poking fun at the Oscars." [...] Rock appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno the Monday before the ceremony to clarify his comments. When Leno asked about the statement, Rock replied [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that.</b> I said only gay people watch the Tonys." [...] However, he reiterated, [...] "I really don't know any straight men who aren't in show business that have ever watched the Oscars." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{controversy}} invoked {{responses from}} some {{cast and crew}} members from the series. Gareth Neame, the executive producer for the BBC was glad that the episode provoked debate, and the producers would adequately defend the episode from their research into making the story. That said Neame was also surprised {{by some of the}} responses, rationalising that those responders did not understand the context, and that it was not intended to offend anybody. Stephen Garrett, the director of Kudos Film and Television, the producer of Spooks agreed, further stating that the episode [...] "deals with very real stuff that's happening in the world. It touches nerves on a regular basis, and deals with uncomfortable truths." [...] Brenton meanwhile stated that [...] "people are free to make what they want of drama," [...] and believed the audience did not like the villains as they portrayed something disturbing in their culture, religion, world or profession. Oyelowo had said that the episode <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> all Muslims are terrorists, only that some fanatics can give [...] "millions of good people a bad name." [...] The actor also believed that the Muslims who were [...] "up in arms" [...] about the story did not see the episode, but merely heard the basis of the plot and did not consider the Muslims in the episode who tried to stop the antagonists.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Jannai {{taught that}} one should always show respect to a ruler, {{following}} the example of Moses, who in [...] told Pharaoh that [...] "all your servants shall [...] [...] [...] bow down to me," [...] but {{out of respect for}} royalty <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Pharaoh himself would seek favors of Moses, as reported in [...] Similarly, a Midrash interpreted God's instructions to Moses and Aaron in [...] "and to Pharaoh, King of Egypt," [...] to convey that God told Moses and Aaron that although God really ought to punish Pharaoh, God wanted Moses and Aaron to show Pharaoh the respect due to his regal position. And Moses did so, as [...] reports that Moses told Pharaoh that God said, [...] "And all these your servants shall come down to Me." [...] Moses <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Pharaoh would come down, only that Pharaoh's servants would do so. But Moses could well have said that Pharaoh himself would come down, for [...] reports, [...] "Pharaoh arose at midnight." [...] But Moses did not mention Pharaoh specifically so as to pay him respect.|$|E
2500|$|Later, a Baton Rouge rape {{survivor}} confronted Vitter at a {{town hall}} meeting saying, [...] " [...] meant everything to me that I was able to put the person who attacked me behind bars ...

2500|$|Even {{after his}} {{appointment}} to the Supreme Court, Frankfurter remained close to the Roosevelt.

Frankfurter greeted Karski's report with skepticism, later explaining: [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he was lying, I said that I could not believe him. There is a difference." ...|$|E

2500|$|At first, Kỳ {{said that}} Thi {{was leaving the}} country to receive medical {{treatment}} for his nasal passages. An official announcement said that the junta [...] "had considered and accepted General Thi's application for a vacation". Thi retorted that [...] "The only sinus condition I have is from the stink of corruption." [...] Kỳ gave a series of reasons for dismissing Thi, accusing him of being too left-wing, of ruling the central regions like a warlord, of having a mistress who was suspected of being a communist, and being too conspiratorial. Kỳ <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Thi supported negotiations {{as a means of}} ending the war, but he did have a history of removing officials and military figures who promoted such a policy.|$|E
