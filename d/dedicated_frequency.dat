The results of the KASI observatory site in Daejeon which was studied in October 2007 are presented.

Specified for the good users, the <b>dedicated</b> <b>frequency</b> spectrum in terms of RBs is equally assigned to the users within each cell. Meanwhile for the interfering users, the users from different cells will be paired as a δ-element group which has no more than δ users sharing the same RB among all, and the RBs will be allocated to the δ-element user group in a sequential way.|$|E

Most applications focus on the transport area where new approaches are dealing with increased traffic and road safety using Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The paper shows how this can be realised by means of procedures for a high precise relative positioning of vehicles vs. other vehicles or infrastructure (e. g. fixed obstacles). For that Galileo based technologies can primary be used being supplemented by additional onboard sensors. The acquired positioning raw data (satellite pseudo ranges, speed, acceleration, etc.), being subject of the same ionospheric interferences within a short range, will be exchanged with other vehicles where special algorithms can calculate the precise distances or velocities finally creating a virtual image of a vehicles surrounding with an extended visual horizon. For the information exchange high amounts of data have to be transferred on <b>dedicated</b> <b>frequencies</b> with standardised procedures. The paper shows that future data communication for that high dynamic radio data traffic with permanent changing link partners needs highly enhanced protocols and access procedures (ad-hoc networks) where each participant gets a precise allocated time slot for transmitting own data.
