40|$|Abstract: Environmental safety {{assessments}} {{for exposure}} of birds require {{the provision of}} acute avian toxicity data for both the pesticidal active substance and <b>formulated</b> products. As an example, testing on the <b>formulated</b> product is waived in Europe using an assessment of data for the constituent active substance(s). This is often not the case globally, because some countries require acute toxicity tests with every <b>formulated</b> product, thereby triggering animal welfare concerns through unnecessary testing. A database of 383 <b>formulated</b> products was compiled from acute toxicity studies conducted with northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) or Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) (unpublished regulatory literature). Of the 383 <b>formulated</b> products studied, 159 contained only active substances considered functionally nontoxic (median lethal dose [LD 50]> highest dose tested). Of these, 97 % had <b>formulated</b> product LD 50 values of> 2000 mg <b>formulated</b> product/kg (limit dose), indicating that no new information was obtained in the <b>formulated</b> product study. Furthermore, defined (point estimated) LD 50 values for <b>formulated</b> products were compared with LD 50 values predicted from toxicity of the active substance(s). This demonstrated that predicted LD 50 values were within 2 -fold and 5 -fold of the measured <b>formulated</b> product LD 50 values in 90 % and 98 % of cases, respectively. This analysis demonstrates that avian acute toxicity testing of <b>formulated</b> products is largely unnecessary {{and should not be}} routinely required to assess avian acute toxicity. In particular, when active substances are known to be functionally nontoxic, further <b>formulated</b> product testing adds no further information and unnecessarily increases bird usage in testing. A further analysis highlights the fact that significant reductions (61 % in this dataset) could be achieved by using a sequential testing design (Organisation for Economi...|$|R

Such objects had been considered as early as 1962 by Paul Dirac, and they were reconsidered by a small but enthusiastic group of physicists in the 1980s.|$|E

In the first trial, the highest survival (> 55 %) was consistently shown by phyllosomata fed a diet consisting of a 50 % combination of Artemia nauplii and 50 % Greenshell mussel, followed by phyllosomata fed 50 % Artemia nauplii and 50 % <b>formulated</b> diet and, thirdly, by those receiving 100 % Artemia nauplii. The second trial assessed the replacement of on-grown Artemia with proportions of <b>formulated</b> diet and Greenshell mussel that differed from those used in trial 1. Phyllosomata fed a 75 % combination of <b>formulated</b> diet and 25 % on-grown Artemia and 50 % on-grown Artemia and 50 % Greenshell mussel consistently showed the highest survival (> 75 %). Combinations of Greenshell mussel and <b>formulated</b> diet resulted in significantly (P 35 %) among all treatments, while those fed a 50 %-squid CP diet showed a significant (P < 0. 05) increase in mortality at day 24. The results of these trials demonstrate that hatcheries can potentially replace 75 % of live on-grown Artemia with a <b>formulated</b> diet 7 days after hatch. The poor performance associated with feeding combinations of Greenshell mussel and <b>formulated</b> diet, and 100 % <b>formulated</b> diet as well as conditioning phyllosomata for 14 - 21 days on live feeds prior to weaning onto a <b>formulated</b> diet highlights the importance of providing Artemia to stimulate feeding...|$|R
