60|$|There was {{an end of}} Theodora's grand {{designs of}} nursing! She could only enter the room at all by favour of the patient and <b>by</b> <b>sufferance</b> of the nurse; and she could attempt no remonstrance when ordered off by her brother, and even felt unworthy of Violet's kiss.|$|R

60|$|The {{family and}} {{descendants}} of Dugald Ciar Mhor lived chiefly {{in the mountains}} between Loch Lomond and Loch Katrine, and occupied {{a good deal of}} property there--whether <b>by</b> <b>sufferance,</b> <b>by</b> the right of the sword, which it was never safe to dispute with them, or by legal titles of various kinds, it would be useless to inquire and unnecessary to detail. Enough;--there they certainly were--a people whom their most powerful neighbours were desirous to conciliate, their friendship in peace being very necessary to the quiet of the vicinage, and their assistance in war equally prompt and effectual.|$|R
60|$|I {{trust it}} is hardly {{necessary}} to specify my knowledge that when I speak of 'the state of my own views' on this question, I do so not of right but <b>by</b> <b>sufferance,</b> <b>by</b> invitation from you, by that more than parental kindness and indulgence with which I have ever met at my parents' hands, which {{it would be as}} absurd to make a matter of formal acknowledgment as {{it would be impossible to}} repay, and for which I can only say, and I say it from the bottom of my heart, may God reward them with his best and choicest gifts, eternal, unfading in the heavens.|$|R
40|$|What is {{the effect}} of a city {{ordinance}} which proposes to a public utility company the terms on which it may dispose of its product to the users, but which is rejected by the company? As to a company not yet doing business {{it is clear that the}} ordinance when rejected becomes a mere legal nullity. It never was more than an offer that might ripen into a binding contract by acceptance. That it is by no means a nullity as to a utility actually operating in the city after the expiration of its franchise and as a mere tenant <b>by</b> <b>sufferance</b> of the streets, is held in City and County of Denver v. Denver Union Water Co. Supreme Court of the U. S. Nos. 294 and 295, decided March 4, 1918. The city of Denver may well be surprised to learn that by passing an ordinance which the company rejected it was considerably worse off than if it had done nothing. In effect, by passing an ordinance fixing the maximum charges permitted to be made by the company 2 ̆ 2 during the time it shall further act as a water carrier and tenant <b>by</b> <b>sufferance</b> of said streets 2 ̆ 2, the city gave to the plant a value that made the rates illegal and defeated the ordinance. That any unaccepted ordinance should have such an effect is indeed startling, the more so that in this case the city was careful to expressly recite in the preamble that the company had for four years been without a franchise and a mere tenant <b>by</b> <b>sufferance</b> of the streets and that this enactment was made without recognizing the right of the company to occupy the streets or to continue its service...|$|R
60|$|A month glided swiftly by. During that interval, Frank Malbone {{was fully}} installed, and Andries consented to suspend {{operations}} with his chain until this necessary work was completed. Work it was; for every lease granted by my grandfather having run out, the tenants had remained on their farms <b>by</b> <b>sufferance,</b> or as occupants at will, holding {{from year to}} year under parole agreements made with Mr. Newcome, who had authority to go that far, but no farther.|$|R
6000|$|... "Unbearable fellow!" [...] cried Ebbo, {{when he had}} latched {{the door}} of the room he shared with his brother. [...] "First, holding up my {{inexperience}} to scorn! As though the Kaisar knew not better than he what befits me! Then trying to buy my silence and my mother's gratitude with his hateful advance of gold. As if I did not loathe him enough without! If I pay my homage, and sign the League to-morrow, it will be purely that he may not plume himself on our holding our own <b>by</b> <b>sufferance,</b> in deference to him." ...|$|R

60|$|So warm is {{the climate}} {{that it is}} almost {{impossible}} to get rid of them. You may seal up every hatchway, and fumigate the hull till the smoke forces itself out at the seams, and enough will survive to repeople the ship in an incredibly short period. In some vessels, the crews of which after a hard fight have given themselves up, as it were, for lost, the vermin seem to take actual possession, the sailors being mere tenants <b>by</b> <b>sufferance.</b> With Sperm Whalemen, hanging about the Line, as many of them do for a couple of years on a stretch, it is infinitely worse than with other vessels.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, child, {{there is}} more or less ocean all round the land; that's what I tell the people ashore, youngster. They are living, as it might be, {{in the midst of the}} sea, without knowing it; <b>by</b> <b>sufferance,</b> as it were, the water being so much the more {{powerful}} and the largest. But there is no end to conceit in this world: for a fellow who never saw salt water often fancies he knows more than one who has gone round the Horn. No, no, this earth is pretty much an island; and all that can be truly said not to be so is water." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{glanced over}} the parchment, and {{instantly}} replied,--"Oh! my dear and royal mistress, only treason itself {{could give you}} other advice than Lord Seyton has here expressed. He, Herries, Huntly, the English ambassador Throgmorton, and others, your friends, are all alike of opinion, that whatever deeds or instruments you execute within these walls, must lose all force and effect, as extorted from your Grace <b>by</b> duresse, <b>by</b> <b>sufferance</b> of present evil, and fear of men, and harm to ensue on your refusal. Yield, therefore, to the tide, and be assured, that in subscribing what parchments they present to you, you bind yourself to nothing, since your act of signature wants that which alone can make it valid, the free will of the granter." ...|$|R
60|$|Burnamy, it seemed, {{had taken}} passage on the Norumbia because he found, {{when he arrived}} in New York the day before, that she was the first boat out. His train was so much behind time that when he reached the office of the Hanseatic League it was {{nominally}} shut, but he pushed in <b>by</b> <b>sufferance</b> of the janitor, and found a berth, which had just been given up, in one of the saloon-deck rooms. It was that or nothing; and he felt rich enough to pay for it himself if the Bird of Prey, who had cabled him to come out to Carlsbad as his secretary, would not stand the difference between the price and that of the lower-deck six-in-a-room berth which he would have taken if he had been allowed a choice.|$|R
60|$|It was the inhuman {{immensity of}} this land that {{astonished}} and oppressed him. He knew the skies were empty of men, the stars were specks in an incredible vastness of space; he knew the ocean was enormous and untamable, but in England {{he had come to}} think of the land as man's. In England it is indeed man's, the wild things live <b>by</b> <b>sufferance,</b> grow on lease, everywhere the roads, the fences, and absolute security runs. In an atlas, too, the land is man's, and all coloured to show his claim to it-- in vivid contrast to the universal independent blueness of the sea. He had taken it for granted that a day would come when everywhere about the earth, plough and culture, light tramways and good roads, an ordered security, would prevail. But now, he doubted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I {{like your}} side of it. For instance. Here's a little thing I can't quite see the end of. Listen! 'Of the domain which Britannia rules <b>by</b> <b>sufferance,</b> my gross captain, knew nothing, and his Navigator, if possible, less. From the bestial recriminations and the {{indeterminate}} chaos of the grand deck, I ascended--always with a whisky-and-soda in my hands--to a scene truly grotesque. Behold my captain in plain sea, at issue with his Navigator! A crisis of nerves due to the enormous quantity of alcohol which he had swallowed up to then, has filled for him the ocean with dangers, imaginary and fantastic. Incapable of judgment, menaced by the phantasms of his brain inflamed, he envisages islands perhaps of the Hesperides beneath his keel--vigias innumerable.' I don't know what a vigia is, Mr. Pyecroft. 'He creates shoals sad and far-reaching of the mid-Atlantic!' What was that, now?" ...|$|R
