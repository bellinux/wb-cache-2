They can form water-soluble complexes with lipophilic drugs, which 'hide' in the cavity. Cyclodextrins {{can be used}} to form aqueous <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solutions with lipophilic drugs, such as steroids and some carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. The cyclodextrins increase the water solubility of the drug, enhance drug absorption into the eye, improve aqueous stability and reduce local irritation.

Topically applied carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) in <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solutions are commonly used to treat glaucoma. However, local eye irritation and multiple daily administrations may hamper their clinical usefulness. Aqueous <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> formulations that improve their topical bioavailability and reduce their eye irritation can improve their clinical efficacy. Earlier studies showed that dorzolamide and closely related CAIs are more effectively delivered into the eye from acidic <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solutions than from comparable neutral solutions. Consequently, dorzolamide was marketed as an aqueous pH 5. 6 <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solution (Trusopt(®), Merck). Later, it was shown that increasing the pH of the <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> from pH 5. 6 to physiologic pH significantly reduced their local irritation. Earlier attempts to use cyclodextrins (CDs) as ocular penetration enhancers in dorzolamide <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solutions failed since; although the CDs were able to enhance the aqueous solubility of dorzolamide, increasing the pH from 5. 6 to physiologic pH reduced {{the ability of the}} drug to permeate into the eye. Later, it was discovered that formulating the drug as aqueous dorzolamide/γCD <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> microparticle suspension resulted in significant bioavailability enhancement. The solid dorzolamide/γCD microparticles are mucoadhesive and release dorzolamide into the aqueous tear fluid for extended time period. Consequently, sustained high dorzolamide concentrations in aqueous humour and various eye tissues were observed after single administration of the aqueous dorzolamide/γCD <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> microsuspension.

Glaucoma <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> have hypotensive effects and like all other medications are associated with adverse effects. Adverse reactions may either result from the main agent or from preservatives used in the drug vehicle. The preservative benzalkonium chloride, is one such compound that causes frequent adverse reactions such as superficial punctate keratitis, corneal erosion, conjunctival allergy, and conjunctival injection. Adverse reactions related to main hypotensive agents have been divided into those affecting the eye and those affecting the entire body. In particular, β-blockers frequently cause systematic adverse reactions, including bradycardia, decrease in blood pressure, irregular pulse and asthma attacks. Prostaglandin analogs have distinctive local adverse reactions, including eyelash bristling/lengthening, eyelid pigmentation, iris pigmentation, and upper eyelid deepening. No systemic adverse reactions {{have been linked to}} prostaglandin analog <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> usage. These adverse reactions may be minimized when they are detected early and prevented by reducing the number of different <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> used (via fixed combination <b>eye</b> <b>drops),</b> reducing the number of times <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> are administered, using benzalkonium chloride-free <b>eye</b> <b>drops,</b> using lower concentration <b>eye</b> <b>drops,</b> and providing proper drop instillation training. Additionally, a one-time topical medication can be given to patients to allow observation of any adverse reactions, thereafter the preparation of a topical medication with the fewest known adverse reactions can be prescribed. This does require precise patient monitoring and inquiries about patient symptoms following medication use.

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} efficacy of diclofenac sodium <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> for postoperative recurrence of pterygium, {{and to provide}} safer drug regimens to prevent the recurrence of pterygium. METHODS: From November 2011 to September 2013, 124 patients 134 eyes who underwent surgery because of pterygium in our hospital were randomly divided into trial group(diclofenac sodium <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> and sodium hyaluronate <b>eye</b> <b>drops)</b> and control group(tobramycin dexamethasone <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> and sodium hyaluronate <b>eye</b> <b>drops),</b> all patients were followed up for 3 mo(once a week) and the cornea, intraocular pressure and recurrence of pterygium were observed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Followed up for 3 mo, 43 cases(45 eyes) in the trial group and 38 cases(39 eyes) {{in the control group}} had done the follow up as planned, in which 14 cases(15 eyes) showed the signs of recurrence, 2 cases(3 eyes) recurred eventually in the trial group, and in the meantime there were 12 cases(13 eyes) with signs of recurrence and 2 cases(2 eyes) with a recurrence eventually in the control group, but no statistical difference was found between the two groups(P > 0. 05); there were 6 cases(9 <b>eyes)</b> <b>dropped</b> out of the study with a higher intraocular pressure in the control group, compared to trial group(0 cases of 0 eye), the difference was statistically significant(P P > 0. 05).

40|$|AIM:To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} effect of excimer laser in situ keratomileusis after the early application of latanoprost <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> in prevention of refractive regression. METHODS:Patients were randomly divided into experimental group, {{positive control group}} and blank control group, each group of 50 cases(100 eyes). In experimental group, patients used latanoprost <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> once {{from the first day}} after the operation, and the <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> were discontinued after three months. The positive control group applied timolol <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> in the morning and evening respectively, and the <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> were discontinued after three months. Blank control group without any ocular hypotensive drugs. Effect of preoperative, postoperative 1 week, 1 month, 3, 6, 12, 24 months, the uncorrected visual acuity(UCVA),subjective refraction, corneal posterior surface, intraocular pressure, BUT, Schirmer test and other aspects of the change were observed. RESULTS:There was no retreatment cases in experimental group and positive control group. Forty-eight cases of experimental group were able to adhere to employ latanoprost ophthalmic solution once daily for three months, while the positive control group had only 41 cases adhering to use timolol <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> twice daily for three months. There was significant difference. The blank control group of 4 retreatment cases were appeared, there were significant differences compared with experimental group. No significant differences in BUT, Schirmer test among three groups were found. CONCLUSION:Latanoprost <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> can effectively prevent excimer laser in situ keratomileusis retreatment, with less side effects and better patient compliance...|$|R

(®) Self-aggregating γCD nanoparticle <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> containing 3 % dorzolamide were given once a day (QD) and compared with Trusopt given three times a day (TID) in a prospective randomized single masked crossover trial over 24 [*]h. Seventeen subjects with IOP over 18 [*]mmHg were recruited. IOP was measured with an Icare Tonometer Pro. (®) Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the IOP lowering effect of dorzolamide nanoparticle <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> QD and Trusopt TID. At peak (4 [*]h), the IOP reduction from baseline was 3. 8 ± 2. 6 [*]mmHg (18 %, P 0. 05) in nanoparticle <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> group and 1. 5 ± 2. 0 [*]mmHg (7 %, P> 0. 05) in the Trusopt group (P= 0. 23 between groups). Burning sensation measured on the visual analogue scale (1 - 100) was less from the nanoparticle <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> (12 ± 15) than from the Trusopt (37 ± 30), (P= 0. 0038). Visual acuity and conjunctival hyperemia did not differ between the two groups.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report a case of corneal {{staining}} after treatment with topical tetracycline. METHODS: A patient with crystalline keratopathy caused by Streptococcus viridans after corneal transplantation was treated topically with tetracycline <b>eye</b> <b>drops,</b> based on results of bacterial sensitivity testing. After 3 weeks of intensive treatment, the donor cornea was stained with a brownish hue, which was ascribed to the tetracycline drops. RESULTS: One patient with crystalline keratopathy developed corneal staining after intensive treatment with topical tetracycline <b>eye</b> <b>drops.</b> After a year of follow-up, the staining of the cornea had not changed significantly. CONCLUSION: Hourly topical tetracycline <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> may induce corneal pigmentation. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of corneal staining caused by tetracycline <b>eye</b> <b>drop...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose: The Ex Vivo Eye Irritation Test (EVEIT) is used {{to analyse}} the {{clinical}} observations of corneal calcification attributed {{to the presence of}} phosphate within applied <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> used in treating glaucoma, Still-Chauffard syndrome, ocular burns and dry eyes. Method: Live corneas from abattoir rabbit eyes were cultured in order to study epithelial healing following mechanical abrasion of the corneal surface combined with repeated exposure to various <b>eye</b> <b>drops.</b> Results: Obvious corneal calcification of the wound area along with a complete epithelial healing covering the calcified area was observed following exposure to phosphate hyaluronate <b>eye</b> <b>drops.</b> Epithelial healing without calcification was achieved using citrate hyaluronate <b>eye</b> <b>drops.</b> Conclusion: Clinical observations show that topical use of artificial tears containing phosphate on injured eyes may lead to sight-threatening corneal complications. Simulation of such treatment conditions by the EVEIT convincingly demonstrate that changes in the composition of the pharmaceutically used treatments can prevent this undesired side effect. Although considerable healing was achieved during the repeated application of <b>eye</b> <b>drops,</b> using either phosphate or citrate buffered, only the drops containing citrate did not develop corneal calcification on the eye. We therefore recommend discontinuing the use of phosphate buffered <b>eye</b> <b>drops,</b> or other topically applied solutions, to avoid further injury to the patient...|$|R
40|$|AIM:To {{compare the}} effect of {{recombinant}} human epidermal growth factor <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> and deproteinized calf blood extract <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> on corneal edema after phacoemulsification. METHODS:Totally 72 cases(72 eyes) of patients undergoing phacoemulsification were selected and divided into the observation group and the control group by random number table method. After surgery, the observation group were treated with deproteinized calf blood extract <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> while the control group were treated with recombinant human epidermal growth factor <b>eye</b> <b>drops.</b> The degree of corneal edema, subjective symptom score, corneal endothelium count, changes of corneal thickness and postoperative visual acuity recovery were compared {{between the two groups}} at different time points after surgery. RESULTS:Corneal edema in the two groups was significantly milder at 1 wk after surgery than that on the 1 st day after surgery(P P > 0. 05). Compared with 1 d after surgery, the subjective symptom score and corneal thickness of the two groups significantly decreased on the 7 th day after surgery(P P P CONCLUSION:Both of recombinant human epidermal growth factor <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> and deproteinized calf blood extract <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> can significantly relieve corneal edema and improve visual acuity of patients after phacoemulsification.
