25|$|On a <b>flatbed</b> <b>lorry</b> {{driven in}} the streets of London, a {{motorcar}} is under a grey cover with the initials RR. The Rolls Royce is first purchased by Charles, Marquess of Frinton (Rex Harrison) as a 10th wedding anniversary present for his French wife, Eloise (Jeanne Moreau). Frinton is Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office. The marquess is a longtime horse owner who has his heart set on winning the Ascot Gold Cup. This year his horse, named 10 June (his wedding anniversary date; also the writer Terence Rattigan's birthday) is the favourite and does indeed win. Lord Frinton is presented the Gold Cup by King George V. However, his elation is blighted when he finds his wife with her lover, his underling John Fane (Edmund Purdom), {{in the back of the}} Rolls with the shades drawn. For appearance's sake, Lord Frinton will not divorce his wife, but he returns the car.|$|E
500|$|On Saturday 6 July 1957, The Quarrymen {{played at}} St. Peter's Church Rose Queen garden fête in Woolton. They first {{played on the}} back of a moving <b>flatbed</b> <b>lorry,</b> in a {{procession}} of floats that carried the Rose Queen and retiring Rose Queen, Morris dancers, Boy Scouts, Brownies, Girl Guides and Cubs, led by the Band of the Cheshire Yeomanry. At 4:15 they played on a permanent stage in the field behind the church, before a display by the City of Liverpool Police Dogs. They were playing [...] "Come Go with Me" [...] when Paul McCartney arrived, and in the Scout hut after the set, Ivan Vaughan introduced McCartney to Lennon, who chatted for a few minutes before the band set up in the church hall for their performance at that evening's [...] "Grand Dance". McCartney demonstrated how he tuned his guitar and then sang Eddie Cochran's [...] "Twenty Flight Rock", Gene Vincent's [...] "Be-Bop-A-Lula", and a medley of Little Richard songs.|$|E
50|$|Finally, a <b>flatbed</b> <b>lorry</b> {{carrying}} 10 tonnes of C16-grade timber can used {{to support}} unstable structures that may collapse.|$|E
50|$|The lighter {{tanks of}} the inter-war period were carried on simple rigid <b>flatbed</b> <b>lorries.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{station is}} still {{referenced}} as Maespoeth Junction, {{even though the}} Upper Corris Tramway no longer exists. The actual junction track work is still in place, and the first hundred yards of the tramway's track remains in place, rising sharply to meet the neighbouring roadway. This last spur of the old tramway is still occasionally used as a facility for transferring engines and rolling stock to <b>flatbed</b> <b>lorries</b> for road transportation.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 the Brigade {{purchased}} a heavy distribution unit (HDU), a Mercedes-Benz Actros <b>flatbed</b> <b>lorry</b> used for general distribution of bulk equipment to major incidents.|$|E
50|$|It has two gears, chain transmission, six {{wheels and}} ten {{pneumatic}} tyres, {{and a body}} made from white ash and mahogany. It was a <b>flatbed</b> <b>lorry</b> and then a tar sprayer in its original commercial life, before being bought from a scrapyard for preservation in 1962.|$|E
50|$|A {{flatbed truck}} (or <b>flatbed</b> <b>lorry</b> in British English) {{is a type}} of truck which can be either {{articulated}} or rigid. As the name suggests, its bodywork is just an entirely flat, level 'bed' with no sides or roof. This allows for quick and easy loading of goods, and consequently they are used to transport heavy loads that are not delicate or vulnerable to rain, and also for abnormal loads that require more space than is available on a closed body.|$|E
5000|$|The flour was {{originally}} distributed in 280 lb (127 kg) sacks piled high on horse-drawn drays. Later these {{were replaced by}} motor vehicles; a steam-driven [...] "Sentinel" [...] and, later, by Dennis lorries, the early models having solid tyres. Railways were also used for flour delivery. The company built up a fleet of <b>flatbed</b> <b>lorries</b> and bulk tankers {{to adapt to the}} transition from rail to road transport.|$|R
50|$|In the UK static caravans, {{which have}} wheels and a {{rudimentary}} chassis with no suspension or brakes, are therefore transported {{on the back}} of large <b>flatbed</b> <b>lorries,</b> the axle and wheels being used for movement to the final location when the static caravan is moved by tractor or 4x4. A static caravan will normally stay on a single plot for many years, and have many of the modern conveniences one would normally find in a home.|$|R
50|$|Restored by Clive Ellis this 'W' type is now {{fitted with}} a <b>flat</b> bed <b>lorry</b> body. It is {{currently}} owned by Clive's daughter, Julia, and is frequently rallied in the Nottinghamshire area.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle was}} created in 2002, when a tourism {{transport}} operator, the Northern Star Motor Carriage Company, converted a 1931 Sentinel steam-powered DG6P <b>flatbed</b> <b>lorry</b> into a 30-seat bus. It is used to take people {{on a tour of}} the town, providing up to ten trips per day over the summer months. It is the only steam bus in revenue-earning service in the world and has become something of a tourist attraction in its own right. As of April 2015 it has been purchased by Crosville, a public and heritage bus operator in Weston-super-Mare.|$|E
5000|$|The funeral left Coulter's home on St Mary's Court on the Shankill. The cortege briefly {{stopped at}} the spot where Coulter was killed outside a betting shop on the Crumlin Road. A <b>flatbed</b> <b>lorry</b> {{containing}} floral tributes with blacked out number plates led the cortege. Businesses along the route were closed and there was a heavy police and army presence in the back streets around the Shankill in case of trouble. Coulter was buried in Roselawn Cemetery where a UDA statement expressing [...] "disgust at the cowardly and brutal murder" [...] was read out.|$|E

50|$|The {{completed}} cloth {{was taken}} by horse and cart and train to finishers for bleaching and dyeing. Around 1910, the hauliers, ex-employees of the mill invested in two steam driven <b>flat</b> bed <b>lorries.</b> These were impounded in 1915 for war work, and horses briefly returned. In April 1913 quotes were sought from William Roberts & Co of Nelson to upgrade the engine, which mainly included replacing the slide-valve cylinders with more efficient Corliss valve cylinders. This work was carried out during the following Wakes Week.|$|R
50|$|This 'W' type has S&D's 3,620 cc side vale {{engine and}} after service with Ketton R.D. C. was with J & D Hadfield, a coach & haulage company, from about 1967 until 1977 {{when it was}} {{purchased}} by Ted Hoole from Sheffield. Converted to a <b>flat</b> bed <b>lorry</b> by Ted, and carrying an ex-railway box van body, which housed a fair ground organ, the SD was to be found at fairs and rallies in the summer months for 23 years until 2010. In Spring 2010 the vehicle was purchased by Michael Cooper who fitted a replica Chelsea type body and re-sprayed the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The artist's cast (0/6) {{was stolen}} from the Henry Moore Foundation at Perry Green, Hertfordshire on 15 December 2005. It is {{believed}} to have been hoisted onto the back of a stolen <b>flatbed</b> Mercedes <b>lorry</b> using a crane, cut up for scrap the same night, and shipped to Rotterdam, and then probably to the Far East. The sculpture was estimated to be worth £3m, but only £1,500 as scrap. The theft inspired German artist Fritz Balthaus in 2009 to cast bronze ingots of equivalent weight which, arranged in a form approximating Moore's sculpture, are displayed as Pure Moore at the Federal Criminal Police Office in Berlin.|$|R

40|$|Traumatic {{bilateral}} posterior dislocation {{of the hip}} is a rare injury, usually {{sustained in}} automobile acci-dents or less commonly in automobile-pedestrian accidents. An unusual mechanism of such an injury is reported {{in the setting of}} an agricultural accident: a heavy load fell on the pelvis of a farmer, while he was bending forward. This case highlights the impor-tance of following health and safety guidelines at work, and above all common sense when working in hazardous situations. CASE REPORT A 30 -year-old farm worker was discharging a large pigpen containing eight pigs from a <b>flat</b> back <b>lorry,</b> by crane. The man was underneath the sus-pended pigpen, flexed at his waist, when the cran...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWinery {{wastewater}} poses {{a serious}} environmental problem, especially for small wineries whose yearly wastewater production and/or financial resources {{may not be}} sufficient to warrant advanced treatment plants. We constructed an integrated mobile system comprised of a coago-flocculation module using nanocomposites to reduce TSS, and two series of aerated cells to reduce COD, N, polyphenols, and P concentrations so effluents could be discharged into a municipal wastewater treatment plant or under special conditions, recycled for irrigation. Each series consists of four portable containers (1. 5 m 3) filled with volcanic tuff of a decreasing progressive particle-size structure and equipped with a forced-air apparatus to keep a minimum soluble oxygen level of 1. 5 mgL− 1. The key feature of the aerated cells is constant air transfer through the substrate which greatly increases treatment capacity. The entire system was mounted on two <b>flat</b> <b>lorry</b> beds equipped with a special hook for easy transportation. We tested the system during two consecutive vintage seasons in 2013 and 2014. The nanocomposite module reduced the TSS by more than 95 % while the aerated cells decreased the COD concentration to less than 700 mgL− 1 at the discharge point (90 – 95 % removal efficiency), which meets the stringent requirement for release to a municipal wastewater treatment plant. TP concentrations were reduced from a mean of 42 mgL− 1 in the first cells to 2. 2 mgL− 1 in the outlet of the system with an overall reduction efficiency of 95 %. The maximum COD loading rate was 8. 66 kgm 3 d− 1, a remarkably high rate considering the minimal operating area. The aerated cells are susceptible to clogging, but we solved this problem with a ‘hoist-sack solution’ and/or treatment with a H 2 O 2 solution that can be implemented easily without majorly impeding normal operation...|$|R
5000|$|It was the {{intention}} of the company to only repaint locomotives where existing paintwork was in poor condition. The paintwork on the Class 60 locomotives was still under warranty and most remained in triple grey livery and received a large body side logo and orange flashes next to the cab doors. However, June 1995 saw 60059 repainted in full Loadhaul livery and named [...] "Swinden Dalesman". Unveiled at the Hillhead Quarry exhibition, the repaint was part of a public relations exercise with Tilcon Roadstone. No shunters received Loadhaul livery despite being operated by the company. A small fleet of <b>flat</b> bed articulated <b>lorry</b> trailers received black livery with orange ends for steel movements from Rotherham Steel Terminal.|$|R
5000|$|Production {{moved to}} a new factory on Brunswick Street, South Wigston in 1935 and this allowed them to build {{complete}} vehicles, whereas the manufacture of bodies had previously been outsourced to the Brush Electrical Engineering Company in Loughborough. They also bought in axles and braking systems, but the chassis, motor, and controller were made in-house. One early failure was the Trilec, a 3-wheeled vehicle with two steerable wheels at the front and a fixed motorised wheel at the back. It suffered from a lack of weather protection for the operator, who sat over the rear wheel, and this also restricted forward visibility. However, more conventional vehicles sold well, and were available in six chassis types by the mid-1930s, suitable for payloads of 5/8 cwt, 10/12 cwt, 18/22 cwt, 25/30 cwt, 40 cwt and 60 cwt. They could be fitted with an open-deck body for milk delivery, a closed van body, or a <b>flat</b> deck <b>lorry</b> body, while more specialist designs were produced for the collection of refuse. Each vehicle was fitted with a clock, and came with a lapel badge for the driver to wear.|$|R
