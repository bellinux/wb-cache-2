The nature and abundance of molecular and supra-molecular species differs significantly compared to the distribution of species under ambient conditions at the same pH.

40|$|Glass {{formation}} in alkali molybdate systems is investigated through {{measurements of the}} critical cooling rate, i. e. the cooling rate necessary to prevent crystallization entirely. Similarities and differences with alkali tungstate systems are noted, and the latter are explained by postulating a more continuous transition of the molybdenum ion from tetrahedral to octahedral coordination with decreasing alkali oxide content of the systems {{as compared with the}} behavior of tungstates, where tetrahedral coordination is found in all glasses. In addition, disproportionation of <b>dimolybdate</b> ions into monomers and higher polymeric units is assumed to be less pronounced in molybdate systems than the disproportionation of ditungstate ions in the corresponding tungstate systems.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. In this study, the {{coordination}} of certain Group 6 and Group 10 & 11 metals to Odonor and S-donor ligands were investigated. For the most part, this involved the isolation of new Mo(VI) and W(VI) complexes. By using a distribution diagram that shows the dependence {{of the type of}} species in solution with pH, we attempted to crystallize new polyoxoanion species of the two metals. It was found that the products that crystallize are not necessarily dependant upon the relative concentrations of the species in solution, but rather on the effective packing of the crystal types that are prepared. During this study a unique W(VI) polyanion, [(CH 3 CH 2) 4 N] 2 [W 6 O 19] (4), was isolated. The Mo(VI) analogue of this compound as well as the dinuclear Mo(VI) -W(VI) complex have been reported previously, but a pure W(VI) compound of this type has not been successfully isolated yet. A new polymorph of a known <b>dimolybdate,</b> K 2 Mo 2 O 7 ·H 2 O (1), was also crystallized, even though <b>dimolybdate</b> species do not generally occur in solution. This structure, although previously reported, shows some differences with the one in the literature, in particular large deviations in unit cell dimensions. Subsequently, as a second component of this study, a variety of carboxylates were coordinated to Mo(VI) and W(VI) species in an acidic medium. Two new complexes of Mo(VI) with these carboxylate ligands were isolated: [(CH 3 CH 2) 4 N][MoO 3 (mal) ]·H 2 O (5) (mal = malate) and Na 6 [Mo 2 O 5 (cit) 2] (6) (cit = citrate). The ligands are two- and threefold deprotonated respectively and coordinate in a polydentate manner to the metal centra. The formation of compound 5 in solution has been known for many years, but the structure of this complex has not been determined in the solid state until now. Also, the tungsten analogue of compound 6 was reported years ago, but the Mo(VI) complex has not been crystallized before. Compounds 5 and 6 exhibit a 1 : 1 and 2 : 2 metal to ligand ratio respectively, and these ratios are quite rare in Mo(VI) crystal chemistry. Finally, the <b>dimolybdate</b> complex, [CH 3) 3 N(CH 2) 6 N(CH 3) 3][Mo 2 O 7 (cit) ] (7), was isolated, and its structure determined and compared to the one in the literature. In the third part of this study, our attention shifted to the group 10 and 11 metals, platinum and gold. Attempts were made to coordinate unusual ligands with donor atoms P, Se and/or S to these metal centers. During this investigation, we isolated a unique Pt(IV) complex, PtCl 2 (S 3 C 8 H 7) 2 (9). The structure of this compound that was determined crystallographically involves {{the coordination}} of two identical R-SCS 2 fragments to the metal ion forming four-membered chelate rings. No compounds of Pt and Au with the P-Se ligand, P 3 Se 3 (C(C 6 H 5) 3) 3, could be isolated. However, a mixed valence compound of Au(I,III), [Au(I) Cl(S(CH 2 C 6 H 5) 2) ][Au(III) Cl 3 (S(CH 2 C 6 H 5) 2] (8), could be isolated and characterized. In this compound Au exhibits two oxidation states, + 1 and + 3. Although the complex has been reported previously, the structure was not described fully, and we now unequivocally determined its crystal structure. The extended structure shows the formation of chains of alternating Au(I) and Au(III) centers with a separation of 5. 610 Å...|$|E
40|$|High purity {{molybdenum}} {{metal powder}} is produced commercially from hexavalent molybdenum precursors, viz. : ammonium <b>dimolybdate</b> (ADM) or molybdenum trioxide. One conventional process incorporates first-stage and second-stage flowsheet components, with hydrogen gas serving as reductant. This two-stage strategy is employed {{in order to}} minimize the formation of volatile molybdenum species that would otherwise be generated at the high temperature required to obtain molybdenum (Mo) in a single stage conversion of the molybdenum precursor. Although molybdenum powder has been produced commercially for over a century, a comprehensive understanding of the kinetic mechanisms and powder characteristics, e. g. oxygen content and particle morphology, is far from being definitive. In fact, it might be argued that the “art ” and engineering, in a commercial context, has advanced ahead of the fine-detail science-derived metallurgical process-engineering. Theoretical contributions presented in this paper are focused primarily on the fundamentals of the conversion process associated with second-stage reduction process – MoO 2 to Mo and the factors that contribute to the oxygen content of the molybdenum powder product (1000 to 100 ppm(w) O, range).

40|$|Cryospray (CSI-) and {{electrospray}} {{mass spectrometry}} (ESI-MS) techniques have been utilised {{to investigate the}} key features of the ‘in-solution’, self-assembly processes by which complex polyoxometalate systems, such as ((n-C 4 H 9) 4 N) 2 n(Ag 2 Mo 8 O 26) n and ((n- C 4 H 9) 4 N) 3 [MnMo 6 O 18 ((OCH 2) 3 CNH 2) 2], are formed. CSI-MS monitoring of the rearrangement of molybdenum Lindqvist anions, [Mo 6 O 19] 2 -, {{in the presence of}} silver(I) ions, into a silver-linked β-octamolybdate structure, has allowed elucidation of the role of small isopolyoxomolybdate fragments and AgI ions in the assembly process. The observation of higher mass fragments, each with increasing organic cation contribution concomitant with their increasing metal nuclearity, has supported the previously proposed hypothesis that the organic cations have a structure-directing role in promoting the mode of POM structure growth in solution. The combined use of UV/vis spectroscopy and real-time CSI-MS monitoring of the reaction solution allowed correlation between the decreasing Lindqvist anion concentration and increasing β-octamolybdate anion concentration. Furthermore, UV/vis spectroscopy was used to show that the rate of decrease in Lindqvist anion concentration, and therefore, the inter-conversion of Lindqvist into β-octamolybdate anions, decreases as the carbon chain length of the alkylammonium cations in the system increases. This approach was extended to use ESI-MS monitoring in examining the formation of the more complex, organic-inorganic, Mn-Anderson polyoxomolybdate structure ((n- C 4 H 9) 4 N) 3 [MnMo 6 O 18 ((OCH 2) 3 CNH 2) 2]. In this investigation, ESI-MS was used to monitor the real-time, ‘in-solution’ rearrangements of α-octamolybdate anions, [α- Mo 8 O 26] 4 -, and coordination of manganese(III) cations and tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS) groups {{in the formation of the}} Mn-Anderson- TRIS structure. These investigations have led to the proposal that the rearrangement of [α- Mo 8 O 26] 4 - anions occurs first through decomposition to [Mo 4 O 13] 2 - cluster species, i. e. halffragments of the octamolybdate anion; followed by decomposition to smaller, stable isopolyoxomolybdate fragment ions such as <b>dimolybdate</b> and trimolybdate fragment ions. It has then been proposed these fragments subsequently coordinate with the tripodal TRIS ligands, manganese ions, and further molybdate anionic units to form the final, derivatized Mn-Anderson-TRIS cluster. Investigations into the encapsulation of the high oxidation state heteroanion templates {IVIIO 6 } and {TeVIO 6 } within polyoxomolybdate clusters, have led to the isolation and characterization of two new, molybdenum Anderson-based POM architectures, i. e. Cs 4. 67 Na 0. 33 [IMo 6 O 24]·ca 7 H 2 O and Na 4 ((HOCH 2 CH 2) 3 NH) 2 [TeMo 6 O 24]·ca 10 H 2 O. The use of coordinating caesium and sodium cations allowed the formation of a closely-packed structure composed of the periodate-centred Anderson clusters arranged into two layers, which then form a repeating ABAB pattern through the lattice. In contrast, the main building-blocks of the tellurium-based cluster system features the [TeMo 6 O 24] 6 - anions and two coordinated cation arrangements, each composed of a {Na 2 } dimer and coordinated TEAH+ cation. The presence of this structural motif, and its inter-connection with adjacent clusters, has led to chain-like packing arrangements within the greater lattice structure. The introduction of three aromatic, phenanthridinium-based cations into polyoxometalate systems has led to the isolation and characterization of three new POM architectures with emergent photoactivity. The polyoxometalate framework in each is composed of tungsten Keggin clusters, i. e. [PW 12 O 40] 3 -, which are introduced into the systems as pre-formed building-blocks. Two of the compounds use derivatives of Dihydro-Imidazo- Phenanthridinium (DIP) molecules as cations, i. e. (DIP- 1) [PW 12 O 40]· 5 DMSO·ca 1 H 2 O and (DIP- 2) [PW 12 O 40]· 5 DMSO·ca 4 H 2 O, whereas the final compound uses an Imidazo- Phenanthridinium (IP) molecule as the cationic unit, i. e. (IPblue) 3 [PW 12 O 40]· 4 DMSO. The use of these cations, which have different steric bulk, geometry and charge states, has led to the formation of interesting packing arrangements within the lattice structures of all three compounds. Additionally, further characterization of these compounds has revealed they all possess emergent photoactivity, in the form of intermolecular charge transfer bands in the solid state. Some degree of intermolecular charge transfer in the solution state has also been detected for the DIP- 2 -based structure...|$|E
