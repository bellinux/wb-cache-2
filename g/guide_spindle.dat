40|$|The co-chaperone BAG 3, {{in complex}} {{with the heat}} shock protein HSPB 8, {{plays a role in}} protein quality control during {{mechanical}} strain. It is part of a multichaperone complex that senses damaged cytoskeletal proteins and orchestrates their seclusion and/or degradation by selective autophagy. Here we describe a novel role for the BAG 3 -HSPB 8 complex in mitosis, a process involving profound changes in cell tension homeostasis. BAG 3 is hyperphosphorylated at mitotic entry and localizes to centrosomal regions. BAG 3 regulates, in an HSPB 8 -dependent manner, the timely congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate by influencing the three-dimensional positioning of the mitotic spindle. Depletion of BAG 3 caused defects in cell rounding at metaphase and dramatic blebbing of the cortex associated with abnormal spindle rotations. Similar defects were observed upon silencing of the autophagic receptor p 62 /SQSTM 1 that contributes to BAG 3 -mediated selective autophagy pathway. Mitotic cells depleted of BAG 3, HSPB 8 or p 62 /SQSTM 1 exhibited disorganized actin-rich retraction fibres, which are proposed to <b>guide</b> <b>spindle</b> orientation. Proper spindle positioning was rescued in BAG 3 -depleted cells upon addition of the lectin concanavalin A, which restores cortex rigidity. Together, our findings suggest the existence of a so-far unrecognized quality control mechanism involving BAG 3, HSPB 8 and p 62 /SQSTM 1 for accurate remodelling of actin-based mitotic structures that <b>guide</b> <b>spindle</b> orientation...|$|E
40|$|Oriented cell {{division}} {{is a fundamental}} determinant of tissue organization. Simple epithelia divide symmetrically in {{the plane of the}} monolayer to preserve organ structure during epithelial morphogenesis and tissue turnover. For this to occur, mitotic spindles must be stringently oriented in the Z-axis, thereby establishing the perpendicular division plane between daughter cells. Spatial cues are thought to play important roles in spindle orientation, notably during asymmetric {{cell division}}. The molecular nature of the cortical cues that guide the spindle during symmetric cell division, however, is poorly understood. Here we show directly {{for the first time that}} cadherin adhesion receptors are required for planar spindle orientation in mammalian epithelia. Importantly, spindle orientation was disrupted without affecting tissue cohesion or epithelial polarity. This suggests that cadherin receptors can serve as cues for spindle orientation during symmetric cell division. We further show that disrupting cadherin function perturbed the cortical localization of APC, a microtubule-interacting protein that was required for planar spindle orientation. Together, these findings establish a novel morphogenetic function for cadherin adhesion receptors to <b>guide</b> <b>spindle</b> orientation during symmetric cell division...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the re-contouring {{process of}} {{aircraft}} engine components, the unknown geometry and inhomogeneous material {{properties of the}} workpiece are major challenges. For this reason a new repair process chain is supposed which consists of noncontact geometry identification, process simulation and NC-path planning, followed by a force controlled milling process. A new milling machine prototype is employed to ensure an effective force control loop. By use of a magnetic <b>guided</b> <b>spindle</b> slide, higher dynamics and precise tracking are enabled. Since variation of the process forces result in variable control plant characteristics, an indirect adaptive controller has been designed. Consequently, models of actuator and process are presented and the estimation of the present parameters by a recursive least square algorithm is outlined. Once the parameters are known, the control polynomials are calculated {{on the basis of}} a pole placement control approach. First experimental results of a force controlled milling process are put forward...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Taguchi {{method is}} {{regarded}} as a powerful tool to design optimization for quality. In this study, it was used to find the optimal cutting parameters for precision-drilling operations. The cutting parameters include <b>guiding</b> drilling, <b>spindle</b> speed, feed rate, stepping amount, number of steps and cutting fluid. The considered characteristics of performance are tool life, and the variation of drilled hole-diameter. Taguchi Method and Orthogonal Array were applied to the experiments of precision-drilling so as to allocate the corresponding processing parameters. The obtained results were then evaluated by Response Table, Response Chart, and Analysis of Variance methods (ANOVA) to acquire the optimal processing parameters. These were further confirmed by experiment. Finally, the analysis of the precision-drilling process applied for mold steel SKD 61 shows that this approach can greatly improve the drilling performance of a small-drilling process...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{theoretical}} and physical studies implying that cell-extracellular matrix adhesion geometry governs {{the orientation of}} the cell division axis, the molecular mechanisms that translate interphase adhesion geometry to the mitotic spindle orientation remain elusive. Here, we show that the cellular edge retraction during mitotic cell rounding correlates with the spindle axis. At the onset of mitotic cell rounding, caveolin- 1 is targeted to the retracting cortical region at the proximal end of retraction fibres, where ganglioside GM 1 -enriched membrane domains with clusters of caveola-like structures are formed in an integrin and RhoA-dependent manner. Furthermore, Gαi 1 -LGN-NuMA, a well-known regulatory complex of spindle orientation, is targeted to the caveolin- 1 -enriched cortical region to <b>guide</b> the <b>spindle</b> axis towards the cellular edge retraction. We propose that retraction-induced cortical heterogeneity of caveolin- 1 during mitotic cell rounding sets the spindle orientation in the context of adhesion geometry...|$|R

There were other {{troubles}} thought to be a result of too small an ashpan causing choking of the grate. However, the chief problem was the failure of the unusual derived motion design. The valve gear was insufficiently robust and the valve <b>spindle</b> <b>guides</b> (originally cast iron) had to be replaced in cast steel, but this did not address the fundamental shortcomings of the design and the performance of these large locomotives remained woeful.|$|R
40|$|SummaryAccurate {{control of}} the Ras-related nuclear protein (Ran) GTPase cycle depends on the {{regulated}} activity of regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC 1), Ran’s nucleotide exchange factor. RanBP 1 has been characterized as a coactivator of the Ran GTPase-activating protein RanGAP 1. RanBP 1 can also form a stable complex with Ran and RCC 1, although the dynamics and function of this complex remain poorly understood. Here, we show that formation of the heterotrimeric RCC 1 /Ran/RanBP 1 complex in M phase Xenopus egg extracts controls both RCC 1 ’s enzymatic activity and partitioning between the chromatin-bound and soluble pools of RCC 1. This mechanism is critical for spatial control of Ran-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) gradients that <b>guide</b> mitotic <b>spindle</b> assembly. Moreover, phosphorylation of RanBP 1 drives changes in the dynamics of chromatin-bound RCC 1 pools at the metaphase-anaphase transition. Our findings reveal an important mitotic role for RanBP 1, controlling the spatial distribution and magnitude of mitotic Ran-GTP production and thereby ensuring accurate execution of Ran-dependent mitotic events...|$|R
50|$|A spindle is a {{straight}} spike usually made from wood used for spinning, twisting fibers such as wool, flax, hemp, cotton into yarn. It is often weighted at either the bottom, middle, or top, commonly by a disc or spherical object called a whorl, but many spindles exist {{that are not}} weighted by a whorl, but by thickening their shape towards the bottom, such as Orenburg and French spindles. The spindle may also have a hook, groove, or notch at the top to <b>guide</b> the yarn. <b>Spindles</b> come in many different sizes and weights depending on {{the thickness of the}} yarn one desires to spin.|$|R

Large gantry {{machining}} center {{can be applied}} to large diameter and thickness of the flanges, tube sheets and other large sheet metal processing, the industrialization of this type of device for improving the development of modern processing and manufacturing of great strategic significance. The design and optimization of large-scales heavy gantry CNC Machining Center was mainly investigated in this paper. The finite element model of the beam structure was structured by using finite element analysis software-ANSYS. On the basis of analysis results, the optimal static and dynamic performance of square cross-section of the beam structure has been obtained. The maximal displacement is 0. 531 mm. The maximum displacement of X= 0. 0329 mm, and Y= 0. 531 mm occurred in the contact point of middle beam and spindle box. Z is 0. 0948 mm. The maximal displacement of Y-component is occurred in the contact points of <b>guide</b> and <b>spindle</b> box. This may have a certain impact on the machine processing accuracy.

Analisar o processo de gestão da comercialização na cadeia agroindustrial familiar do açúcar mascavo e os reflexos na sua viabilização é o objeto deste estudo. As análises se orientam pelos conceitos de cadeia de produção agroindustrial, qualidade, comercialização e competitividade, e se sustentam empiricamente nas experiências de duas agroindústrias, cujas informações foram obtidas através de entrevistas semi-estruturadas com integrantes da cadeia, analisadas pelo método de análise de conteúdo, através de observação participante e literatura. Os eixos privilegiados para análise foram a qualidade objetiva e subjetiva do produto, a qualificação profissional dos envolvidos na produção e comercialização, e a infraestrutura de comercialização disponível. Conclui-se que, dentre os principais fatores facilitadores e/ou dificultadores, a cadeia familiar de açúcar mascavo apresenta instabilidade quanto à qualidade do produto (padronização, registro, embalagem, etc.); a falta de qualificação profissional nos segmentos, e especialmente no conhecimento de mercado, inviabiliza a eficiência competitiva; e a infraestrutura de comercialização (transporte, estocagem, comunicação, pontos de venda, etc.) não está articulada entre si e nem com o mercado, operando-se de forma ainda tradicional. O atendimento a essas demandas, no que se refere à gestão da comercialização, constitui condição para viabilizar a cadeia familiar do açúcar mascavo na região estudada. Marketing {{policy is}} considered critical for competitiveness {{of the family}} agribusiness. Its efficiency {{is a result of}} the performance of several chain links. The aim of this study is to analyze the marketing policy process of the family agribusiness on the industrial chain of brown sugar and the reflection on its practicability. The analyses were supported by the concepts of agribusiness production chain, quality, marketing, and competitiveness, and empirically live on the experiences of two firms, whose information was obtained by mean:, of unstructured interviews with some components of the chain. They were examined through contents analysis, participant observation, and bibliography. Objective and subjective quality of the product and qualification of workers involved in the production and marketing processes, as well as available infrastructure of marketing are the <b>guide</b> <b>spindles</b> for analysis. It follows that, among the main constrains and/or enhancers, the family agribusiness on the industrial chain of brown sugar is not stable when it comes to product quality (standards, records, packaging, etc); the lack of professional qualification in the segments, especially concerning market knowledge, makes competitive efficiency impossible; infrastructure of marketing (transportation, storage, communication, points of purchase, etc.) is not intra-linked or linked with the market, and firms still work traditionally. Attention at those matters in the interest of marketing policies amounts to a condition for the practicability of a family industrial chain of brown sugar in the studied region...|$|R
40|$|Mitosis is a {{fundamental}} process {{in the development of}} all organisms. The mitotic <b>spindle</b> <b>guides</b> the cell through mitosis as it mediates the segregation of chromosomes, the orientation of the cleavage furrow, and the progression of cell division. Birth defects and tissue-specific cancers often result from abnormalities in mitotic events. Here, we report a proteomic study of the mitotic spindle from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Four different isolations of metaphase spindles were subjected to Multi-dimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) analysis and tandem mass spectrometry. We identified 1155 proteins and used Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to categorize proteins into cellular component groups. We then compared our data to the previously published CHO midbody proteome and identified proteins that are unique to the CHO spindle. Our data represent the first mitotic spindle proteome in CHO cells, which augments the list of mitotic spindle components from mammalian cells...|$|R
40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kar 9 p, {{one player}} in <b>spindle</b> alignment, <b>guides</b> the bud-ward <b>spindle</b> pole by linking astral {{microtubule}} plus ends to Myo 2 p-based transport along actin cables {{generated by the}} formins Bni 1 p and Bnr 1 p and the polarity determinant Bud 6 p. Initially, Kar 9 p labels both poles but progressively singles out the bud-ward pole. Here, we show that this polarization requires cell polarity determinants, actin cables, and microtubules. Indeed, in a bud 6 bni 1 mutant or upon direct depolymerization of actin cables Kar 9 p symmetry increased. Furthermore, symmetry was selec-tively induced by myo 2 alleles, preventing Kar 9 p binding to the Myo 2 p cargo domain. Kar 9 p polarity was rebuilt after transient disruption of microtubules, dependent on cell polarity and actin cables. Symmetry breaking also occurred after transient depolymerization of actin cables, with Kar 9 p increasing at the spindle pole engaging in repeated cycles of Kar 9 p-mediated transport. Kar 9 p returning to the spindle pole on shrinking astral microtubules may contribute toward this bias. Thus, Myo 2 p transport along actin cables may support a feedback loop by which delivery of astral microtubule plus ends sustains Kar 9 p polarized recruitment to the bud-ward spindle pole. Our findings also explain the link between Kar 9 p polarity and the choice setting aside the old spindle pole for daughter-bound fate...|$|R
