5|$|By 1507, however, Cairano's {{decorative}} lapidary work in {{the interior}} of the San Pietro in Oliveto became known as the third great achievement of the artist, after the Miracoli and the Loggia. The architectural scores that punctuate the sequence of the altar and the composition of the whole, however, are unrelated to Cairano's style. Rather, they are consistent with Sanmicheli, who indeed possessed the only workshop in town capable of engaging a work of this magnitude. Certainly the twelve Apostles in the spandrels in the arches of the nave are Cairano's work - the artist's hand is unmistakable. There is very poor and fragmentary documentation relating to this historic building that <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to us.|$|E
5|$|By 1508, {{construction}} work was completed {{at the north}} of the Loggia, which contained the staircase to access the upper level of the public building. The construction is designed as a body in itself, separated from the main building by a path and connected to it by a covered overpass, a configuration that <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the Loggia after at least five years of a stellar career elsewhere, is the portal to the ground floor of the annex and in some ornamentation on the overpass.|$|E

Mrs. Bueller arrives at the station, upset about having to forgo a house sale, only to find Jeannie kissing the delinquent, infuriating her more.|$|E
5|$|Works more {{directly}} related to Ely were also used. The primary one of these works was Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester's Libellus, large parts of which were copied into the Liber Eliensis. Also incorporated into the Liber was an earlier Vita, or saints' life, on Æthelthryth, the founder and first abbess of Ely. A work on the benefactors of the abbey was also used, and the material from three surviving cartularies. These documents were translated from their original Old English into Latin by the compiler. Another source, as related in the Liber itself, was a work about Hereward the Wake written by a brother monk known as Richard. Modern historians have identified it with the Gesta Herwardi known from a 13th-century manuscript. It is, however, unclear whether the compiler of the Liber used the exact text of the Gesta as it <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to us, or a different, earlier manuscript.|$|E

25|$|The Metrical Dindshenchas, or Lore of Places, is {{probably}} the major surviving monument of Irish bardic verse. It is a great onomastic anthology of naming legends of significant places in the Irish landscape and comprises about 176 poems in total.

As a national compilation, the Metrical Dindshenchas <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to us in two different recensions.

25|$|Uruk {{played a}} very {{important}} part in the political history of Sumer. Starting from the Early Uruk period, exercising hegemony over nearby settlements. At this time (c 3800BC), there were two centers of 20hectares, Uruk in the south and Nippur in the north surrounded by much smaller 10hectare settlements. Later, in the Late Uruk period, its sphere of influence extended over all Sumer and beyond to external colonies in upper Mesopotamia and Syria. Uruk was prominent in the national struggles of the Sumerians against the Elamites up to 2004BC, in which it suffered severely; recollections of some of these conflicts are embodied in the Gilgamesh epic, in the literary and courtly form that <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to us.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} body of text {{appears in}} runic inscriptions and in poems composed c. 900 by Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (although the poems are not preserved in contemporary sources, {{but only in}} much later manuscripts).
