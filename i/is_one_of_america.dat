The largest annual event is the Ellensburg Rodeo and Fair; the rodeo <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> 2 ̆ 7 s top 10 professional rodeos. Since 1923, the site has grown as different properties were purchased and/or allocated by different stakeholders.

40|$|Charles Sumner <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> 2 ̆ 7 s {{greatest}} {{yet most}} neglected statesmen. A {{founder of the}} Free Soil and Republican parties, perhaps the most outspoken anti-slavery leader in the United States Senate from 1851 to 1874, and its powerful Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Sumner must be included in any history of the American anti-slavery movement and of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Yet he is often dismissed as a narrow zealot, while the intellectual and moral principles that propelled him into public life and guided his career are misunderstood or ignored by historians, including his most influential twentieth-century biographer, David Donald. By examining his life until his 1851 election to the Senate, this dissertation seeks to recover Sumner 2 ̆ 7 s true intellectual outlook and character, and thus to help restore him to his true stature in American history. ^ Born in Boston, in the afterglow of the American Revolution and of the Enlightenment, Sumner was deeply influenced by the republican principles of duty, education, and liberty balanced by order, {{as well as by}} Moral Philosophy, the dominant strain of American Enlightenment thinking, which embraced cosmopolitanism and the dignity of man 2 ̆ 7 s intellect and conscience. As a young lawyer, Sumner was greatly attracted by the related principles of Natural Law, which since ancient times had conjoined law and ethics. These influences are symbolized by Sumner 2 ̆ 7 s closeness to John Quincy Adams, William Ellery Channing, and Joseph Story. Sumner, with many early nineteenth-century American intellectuals, desired to build an American culture that would combine the principles of American liberty with European culture. He thus eschewed law for reform—including education, promotion of the arts, prison discipline, international peace, and anti-slavery—and eventually politics, not from rashness or ambition, but from the belief in each individual 2 ̆ 7 s duty to work for the public good and in the humanistic ideals of the Enlightenment. Sumner grew increasingly disillusioned as the controversy surrounding these reforms divided Boston and the nation over the significance of that Enlightenment legacy, but he devoted his entire public career to the realization of the Enlightenment 2 ̆ 7 s vision of a civilized nation, both cultivated and just. ...|$|E

40|$|Cabaret <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> 2 ̆ 7 s {{most unusual}} forms {{of art and}} {{entertainment}} as it juxtaposes and creatively interconnects comedy, song, dance, theatre, speech, and performance art, much like that of its bigger sister, American musical theatre. Many elements of the American musical are shared by cabaret, however, cabaret is unique since it generally occurs in more intimate (and sometimes more unusual) performance venues, such as restaurants, nightclubs, lobbies, halls, small theatres and private homes. With {{close proximity to the}} performer(s), cabaret audiences are often seated at tables where they eat and/or drink while an interlocutor (an interactive Emcee, M. C. or Master of Ceremonies) guides them through the performance. Along with the creative and engaging interaction of an interlocutor, the intimate venue of a cabaret performance creates a forum that allows and encourages the performers 2 ̆ 7 energy to combine with the audience 2 ̆ 7 s as the 2 ̆ 2 theatrical fourth wall 2 ̆ 2 is constantly broken through. The synergistic energy generated by audience and performers creates an entirely new and unique performance phenomena, {{which is one of the}} most exciting, appealing and exceptionally unique qualities of cabaret. Since a small body of scholarship exists on American cabaret as a unique genre, this study provides a thorough analysis and detailed dissection of cabaret both historically and musically. Discussed first is cabaret 2 ̆ 7 s origins, life and development by way of a historical narrative gleaned from existing resources on cabaret. Also tied into this narrative is information on other types of performance and music closely related to cabaret, such as Victorian music halls, concert saloons, dance halls, speakeasies, nightclubs and supper clubs, burlesque, vaudeville, and Tin Pan Alley. Next, this essay identifies and explores the 2 ̆ 2 physical 2 ̆ 2 elements that compose cabaret such as the framework of songs, the connective fabric of interlocking dialogue, songs, and musical numbers, the final look of the performance and the overall sound-blend of the performance. The essay progresses into a more detailed exploration of cabaret by identifying and discussing its 2 ̆ 2 visceral 2 ̆ 2 elements such as basic human nature and intimate contact via the human voice. Likewise, musical examples are presented that illustrate musical elements such as the 2 ̆ 2 composer 2 ̆ 7 s hook, 2 ̆ 2 elicitation of body movement, patter songs and types of accompaniments supportive of the melody. Finally, musical patterns are presented that are analogous to motion, conflict, resolution and circular arcs of context such as syncopated patterns, dotted rhythms, swinging eighth notes, tied-note figures over bar lines, 2 ̆ 2 chromatic toggling 2 ̆ 2 and repeated-against-syncopated patterns. Consequently, all these musical elements in cabaret literature prompt human beings into movement in all three areas of body, mind and spirit. This essay then identifies and delineates several possible types and combinations of cabaret shows, such as formal, improvisational, musical revue, vaudeville-style, stand-up comedy, karaoke, female/male impersonator (drag show), 2 ̆ 2 streetmosphere, 2 ̆ 2 flash mob, piano bar/lounge, open-mic., concert-style, aleatory and a mixture of any and all types. Finally, the most important contribution to cabaret scholarship is this essay 2 ̆ 7 s comprehensive resource on how to create and develop a cabaret show with specific suggestions for themes, music, underscoring, and scripted dialogue. In addition, this essay presents an example of an entire original cabaret show in order to clarify the findings of this study, and encourage further research, creation and composition, practice and prolongation of the genre of American cabaret...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho é o resultado do estudo das relações em rede que se estabelecem entre um grande Resort, e um município de menos de 3000 habitantes no {{interior}} do estado de Goiás. A cidade de Rio Quente abriga em seu território a Pousada do Rio Quente Resorts, que é um dos maiores resorts da América Latina e recebe mais de um milhão de hospedes e visitantes por ano e movimenta milhões de reais neste período. Esta relação é permeada de conflitos e gera uma interdependência única, estabelecida em seu território e que se reflete em suas configurações espaciais. Além dos conflitos gerados a partir dessas novas configurações espaciais estabelecidas, outras redes paralelas e dependentes passam a fazer parte e atuar neste espaço. Redes de transportes de passageiros, visitantes e materiais de consumo, trabalhadores e prestadores de serviços, que foram ao longo do tempo se configurando e alterando o território do município. Os caminhos abertos por todas essas redes imprimiram no território a marca do turismo que até a década de 1960 era uma atividade sem importância, e á partir de então passou a ser o principal meio de desenvolvimento para o município e para toda a região. O turismo trouxe uma mudança radical no município, tanto em seus usos quanto em suas formas. Os usos que eram fundamentalmente um reflexo do meio rural, passa a ser submetido as novas regras impostas pelo olhar do visitante. O mesmo acontecendo com as formas da cidade, que cresceu e se reconfigurou a partir da verticalização intensa de suas construções. Verticalização esta imposta pelo resort que se apropriou de grande parte do território do município. Compreender a atividade turística e suas formas de inclusão e exclusão sociais, e também suas relações de poder na produção do espaço turístico, implicam em estudos amplos e análises objetivas de vários fatores que atuam hora de forma direta e hora indiretamente. This work is {{the result}} of the study of the relationships in net that you/they settle down among a great Resort, and a city of less than 3000 inhabitants inside the state of Goiás. The city of Hot Rio shelters in its territory the Inn of Hot Rio Resorts, that <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>América</b> Latin's largest resorts and it receives more than a million put up and visitors a year and it moves million of Real a year. This relationship is permeated of conflicts and it generates an only interdependence, established in its territory and that is reflected in its space configurations. Besides the generated conflicts á to leave of those new established space configurations, other parallel and dependent nets start to do part and to act in this space. Nets of passengers' transports, visitors and consumption materials, workers and workers of services, that were along the time if configuring and altering the territory of the municipal district. The roads opened by all those nets printed in the territory the mark of the tourism that to the decade of 1960 it was a factor without importance, and á to leave of then it became the main middle of development for the municipal district and for the whole area. The tourism brought a radical change in the municipal district, so much in its uses as in its forms. The uses that were fundamentally a reflex of the rural way, it becomes submitted the new rules imposed by the visitor's glance. The same happening with the forms of the city, that it grew and if reconfiguration á to leave of the intense city grows up of its constructions. Grows up this imposed by the resort that appropriated of great part of the territory of the municipal district. To understand the tourist activity and its inclusion forms and social exclusion, and also its relationships of power in the production of the tourist space, imply in wide studies and objective analyses of several factors that act indirectly hour in a direct way and hour. The tourism is at the present time one in the ways of larger meaning in the capital generation and that comes producing new and several geographical configurations and turning the contradictory space, so much for the action of the state, as for the of the companies, of the inhabitants from the position and mainly of the tourists...|$|E
