40|$|Identification of {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTLs) in experimental animals {{is critical for}} understanding the biochemical bases of complex traits, and thus for the identification of drug targets. The author reviews the basic statistical methods for mapping QTLs in <b>experimental</b> <b>crosses</b> and comments {{on a number of}} the statistical issues to consider in the application of these methods. Traditional genetic studies have concentrated on dichotomous traits such as {{the presence or absence of}} a disease. Such traits are often the result of a mutation at a single gene. However, many interesting traits, like blood pressure or survival time after an infection, are quantitative in nature, and are affected by many genes and by environmental factors. There are several reviews of the statistical methods for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs, the genes responsible for variation in quantitative traits) in <b>experimental</b> <b>crosses</b> 1 - 3.

Interval mapping is currently the most popular approach for QTL mapping in experimental crosses.

In interval mapping, each locus is considered one at a time and the logarithm of the odds ratio (LOD score) is calculated for the model that the given locus is a true QTL.

(It is also a source of personal frustration to Demane: though it is not revealed until the next novel in the series, Crucible of Gold, he and Ensign Emily Roland have formed a romantic attachment, and by obtaining a dragon of his own to fly alongside Excidium, whom she will someday inherit from her mother, he had hoped to increase his standing in her eyes.) ...|$|E

40|$|Apomictic plants often produce pollen {{that can}} {{function}} in crosses with related sexuals. Moreover, facultative apomicts can produce some sexual offspring. In dandelions, Taraxacum, a sexual-asexual cycle between diploid sexuals and triploid apomicts, has been described, based on <b>experimental</b> <b>crosses</b> and population genetic studies. Little {{is known about}} the actual hybridization processes in nature. We therefore studied the sexual-asexual cycle in a mixed dandelion population in the Netherlands. In this population, the frequencies of sexual diploids and triploids were 0. 31 and 0. 68, respectively. In addition, less than 1 % tetraploids were detected. Diploids were strict sexuals, triploids were obligate apomicts, but tetraploids were most often only partly apomictic, lacking certain elements of apomixis. Tetraploid seed fertility in the field was significantly lower than that of apomictic triploids. Field-pollinated sexual diploids produced on average less than 2 % polyploid offspring, implying that the effect of hybridization in the 2 x- 3 x cycle in Taraxacum will be low. Until now, 2 x- 3 x crosses were assumed to be the main pathway of new formation of triploid apomicts in the sexual-asexual cycle in Taraxacum. However, tetraploid pollen donors produced 28 times more triploid offspring in <b>experimental</b> <b>crosses</b> with diploid sexuals than triploid pollen donors. Rare tetraploids may therefore act as an important bridge in the formation of new triploid apomicts. [KEYWORDS: Taraxacum; apomixis; sexual-asexual cycle; hybridization; polyploidy...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{statistical}} methods and software for mapping interacting QTL {{has been the}} focus of much recent research. We previously developed a Bayesian model selection framework, based on the composite model space approach, for mapping multiple epistatic QTL affecting continuous traits. In this study we extend the composite model space approach to complex ordinal traits in <b>experimental</b> <b>crosses.</b> We jointly model main and epistatic effects of QTL and environmental factors on the basis of the ordinal probit model (also called threshold model) that assumes a latent continuous trait underlies the generation of the ordinal phenotypes through a set of unknown thresholds. A data augmentation approach is developed to jointly generate the latent data and the thresholds. The proposed ordinal probit model, combined with the composite model space framework for continuous traits, offers a convenient way for genomewide interacting QTL analysis of ordinal traits. We illustrate the proposed method by detecting new QTL and epistatic effects for an ordinal trait, dead fetuses, in a F 2 intercross of mice. Utility and flexibility of the method are also demonstrated using a simulated data set. Our method has been implemented in the freely available package R/qtlbim, which greatly facilitates the general usage of the Bayesian methodology for genomewide interacting QTL analysis for continuous, binary, and ordinal traits in <b>experimental</b> <b>crosses...</b>|$|R
