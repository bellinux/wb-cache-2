He gives the example of a woman who has learned her husband is dead but cannot bring herself to believe her husband is dead.

2500|$|It {{should be}} {{understood}} that, while the script used here is Devanagari, this has no particular importance. [...] <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>happens</b> currently {{to be the most}} popular script for Sanskrit. [...] The form of the symbols used to write Sanskrit has varied widely geographically and over time, and notably includes in modern times the Tamil and other modern Indian scripts. [...] What is important is that the adherence to the phonological classification of the symbols elucidated here has remained constant in Sanskrit since classical times. [...] It should be further noted that the phonology of modern Indian languages has evolved, and the values given to Devanagari symbols in, e.g. Hindi, differ somewhat from those of Sanskrit.|$|E
