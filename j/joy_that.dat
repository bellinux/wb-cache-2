5|$|Back at Rome, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of {{the cult}} of Augustus which Germanicus became a member of. When news arrived of his raid, Tiberius commemorated his {{services}} in the Senate with elaborate, but insincere praise: the proceedings gave him <b>joy</b> <b>that</b> the mutiny had been suppressed, but anxiety at the glory and popularity afforded to Germanicus. The Senate, in absence of Germanicus, voted {{that he should be}} given a triumph. Ovid's Fasti dates the Senate vote of Germanicus' triumph to 1 January AD 15.|$|E

Some 75 copies of 2BSD were sent out by Bill Joy.|$|E

A {{young girl}} in Grass Valley having died, her father wrote some verses upon the occasion, in which she is made to {{discourse}} thus:-- [...] "Then do not detain me, for why should I stay When cherubs in heaven call me away?

25|$|In an epilogue, an {{old woman}} sits in the Hall of Mirrors, {{apparently}} waiting for someone. She is eventually joined by an old man, who greets her and expresses his <b>joy</b> <b>that</b> she waited, just as he hoped she would. In a flash of light, the old woman is revealed to be Constance {{and the old man}} Daniel. After her death, she waited in the Hall of Mirrors for Daniel, so that the two could advance to the afterlife together. With Daniel's own passing, the two were finally able to be together the way they could not be in life.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Hecker {{returned}} to his farm in Illinois. It was with great <b>joy</b> <b>that</b> he heard of the union of Germany {{brought about by the}} victory over France in 1870-71. It was then that he gave his famous address at St. Louis, in which he gave animated expression to the enthusiasm of the German Americans for their newly united fatherland. After the war, he became more and more involved in the German-language press and Republican Party activities. He received a less favourable impression when he visited Germany in 1873 for criticizing lack of individual rights and the size of government in the new German government organization. He died at his farm in Summerfield, Illinois on March 24, 1881.|$|E
25|$|Old Nick tells <b>Joy</b> <b>that</b> he {{has lost}} his job and threatens {{that he may not}} be able to afford their {{supplies}} in the future. That night, Jack is overcome with curiosity and ventures out of the closet while Old Nick is asleep in bed with his mother. Joy is horrified when she awakens and sees their interaction, slapping Old Nick away. As punishment, he cuts their heat and power. Joy decides to tell Jack about the outside world; he reacts with disbelief and incomprehension, but also curiosity. She has Jack fake a fever, hoping that Old Nick will take him to a hospital where he can alert the authorities, but Old Nick says he will return the following day with antibiotics.|$|E

25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such <b>joy</b> <b>that</b> no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 146 Propertius manuscripts survive, {{the oldest of}} which dates from the 12th century. However, some of the poems in these manuscripts appear disjointed, such as I.8, which begins as a plea for Cynthia to abandon a planned sea voyage, then closes with sudden <b>joy</b> <b>that</b> the voyage has been called off. This poem has {{therefore}} been split by most scholars into a I.8a (comprising the first 26 lines) and I.8b (lines 27-46). More complicated organizational problems are presented by poems like II.26, a confusing piece in which Propertius first (1) dreams of Cynthia being shipwrecked, and then (2) praises Cynthia's faithfulness. Following this, he (3) declares that she plans to sail and he will come along, (4) shifts to the couple together on the shore, and then (5) quickly has them back on-board ship, ready to face the potential dangers of the sea. The images seem to conflict logically and chronologically, and have led different commentators to rearrange the lines or assume some lacuna in the text.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} states of afterlife in Catholic belief. Heaven {{is a time}} of glorious union with God and a life of unspeakable <b>joy</b> <b>that</b> lasts forever. Purgatory is a {{temporary}} place for the purification of souls who, although saved, are not free enough from sin to enter directly into heaven. It is a state requiring penance and purgation of sin through God's mercy aided by the prayers of others. Finally, those who freely chose a life of sin and selfishness, were not sorry for their sins and had no intention of changing their ways go to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without freely deciding to reject God and his love. He predestines no one to hell and no one can determine whether anyone else has been condemned. Catholicism teaches that God's mercy is such that a person can repent even at the point of death and be saved, like the good thief who was crucified next to Jesus.|$|E

25|$|Battle is raging outside. Arindal {{is anxious}} {{and refuses to}} lead the army out. Morald does so instead. Ada appears with her two {{children}} by Arindal. She seems to throw them into a fiery abyss. Meanwhile, defeated warriors rush in. Ada refuses to console Arindal saying {{she has come to}} torment him instead. More defeated warriors arrive with reports that Morald has disappeared, captured or dead. Then Harald, who was sent to bring reinforcements, comes. He reports that his army was defeated by one led by Ada. Arindal curses her. Zemina and Farzana express <b>joy</b> <b>that</b> Ada will remain immortal. But she sorrowfully explains that the fairy-king had required as a condition of her renouncing her immortality, that she conceal her fairy background from Arindal for eight years and on the last day torment him as best she can. If he cursed her, she would remain immortal and be turned to stone for a hundred years while he would go mad and die. In truth, Morald is not dead, the army Harald led was full of traitors, and the children are still alive. Already Arindal can feel his sanity slipping.|$|E

That's feminism; everything is differently oriented. Seeing the same world with different eyes." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewing Alone, Pitchfork writer Jason Crock {{felt that}} the Black Hole demo [...] "Blast Off!"

500|$|After {{graduating from}} Syracuse University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Musical Theatre in 1983, Sorkin moved to New York City {{where he spent}} much of the 1980s as a struggling, {{sporadically}} employed actor who also worked odd jobs, such as delivering singing telegrams, driving a limousine, touring Alabama with the children's theatre company Traveling Playhouse, handing out fliers promoting a hunting-and-fishing show, and bartending at Broadway's Palace Theatre.

500|$|Overall, {{critics were}} {{satisfied}} with A Realm Reborns incremental improvements. Adam Harshberger of GamesRadar compared it to a [...] "buffet dinner [...] everyone's favorite meal", forgiving the lack of innovation. VanOrd likened the game to the [...] "old world" [...] of MMORPGs, safe and familiar. Johnson and Davison both saw A Realm Reborn as a solid foundation for future content to be added in patches and expansions. For Kollar, it was a return to form, [...] "the first Final Fantasy game in years to capture the energy and <b>joy</b> <b>that</b> made me {{fall in love with}} the series". Motoki Shinohara of Famitsu concluded that [...] "I'm really glad that I'm back home in Eorzea".|$|E
500|$|Amy Linden from Vibe {{was less}} {{impressed}} by the album, particularly the songs on which Carey sings over hip hop samples or alongside guest rappers, deeming it a commonplace formula--"pairing a singing thrush with a rhyming thug". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said it was [...] "the first Carey album where she's written personal lyrics, and allusions to her separation from Mottola." [...] He called the lyrics [...] "true" [...] and [...] "deep", but found the songs [...] "ballad-heavy" [...] and [...] "repetitious", adding that the album followed the formula of Carey's previous records too precisely. In his opinion, [...] "it {{would have been a}} more effective album if the heartbreak, sorrow, and <b>joy</b> <b>that</b> bubbles underneath the music were brought to the surface." ...|$|E
