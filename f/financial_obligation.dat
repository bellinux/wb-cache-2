5|$|In 1979, two Michigan businessmen, John Rudzewicz and Brian MacShara, {{entered into}} a {{franchise}} agreement with Burger King to run a restaurant in Detroit, Michigan. After MacShara attended four months of training courses at the regional Burger King training facilities in Michigan and in the Florida headquarters on how to operate and administer a Burger King franchise, {{it was agreed that}} the partners would take over operation of an existing Burger King location in Drayton Plains, Michigan. However, during this time disagreements arose between the partners and Burger King over issues of rent, construction fees, building designs and the assignment of legal liabilities. MacShara and Ruzewicz finally signed their franchise agreement after gaining limited concessions over the issues, with Rudzewicz assuming a 20-year, $1,000,000 <b>financial</b> <b>obligation</b> {{over the life of the}} contract.|$|E

25|$|Reliability {{problems}} and customer complaints began to mount through 1964. In 1964, a dock strike in the US severely damaged Jack Griffith's ability to import cars. Griffith was then {{unable to meet}} his <b>financial</b> <b>obligation</b> to Ford, which stopped supplying drivetrain components. Ties with TVR were also then severed, and the already-struggling TVR was {{no longer able to}} continue. In September 1964, a director meeting was held at TVR, and it was announced that the company would be stopping production and closing the factory at Hoo Hill. TVR went into liquidation in November of that year.|$|E

2500|$|In tabulating the {{assessment}} ballots, the ballots must be weighted {{according to the}} proportional <b>financial</b> <b>obligation</b> of the affected parcel. [...] If {{more than one of}} the record owners of an identified parcel submits an assessment ballot, the amount of the proposed assessment to be imposed upon the identified parcel must be allocated to each ballot submitted in proportion to the respective record ownership interests or, if the ownership interests are not shown on the record, as established to the satisfaction of the agency by documentation provided by those record owners. [...] The assessment ballot process under Proposition 218 is frequently referred to as an “assessment ballot proceeding” and is not technically regarded as an election.|$|E
2500|$|National {{banknotes}} {{are generally}} legal tender, meaning that medium of payment is allowed by law or recognized by a legal {{system to be}} valid for meeting a <b>financial</b> <b>obligation.</b> Historically, banks sought {{to ensure that they}} could always pay customers in coins when they presented banknotes for payment. This practice of [...] "backing" [...] notes with something of substance is the basis for the history of central banks backing their currencies in gold or silver. Today, most national currencies have no backing in precious metals or commodities and have value only by fiat. With the exception of non-circulating high-value or precious metal issues, coins are used for lower valued monetary units, while banknotes are used for higher values.|$|E
2500|$|After marrying George Thomas, Dyer {{trained as}} a nurse. From contact with a midwife, Ellen Dane, she learned of an easier way to earn a living—using her own home to provide lodgings for young women who had {{conceived}} illegitimately and then farming off the babies for adoption or allowing them to die of neglect and malnutrition. (Ellen Dane was forced to decamp to the US, shortly after meeting Amelia, to escape {{the attention of the}} authorities.) Unmarried mothers in Victorian Britain often struggled to gain an income, since the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act had removed any <b>financial</b> <b>obligation</b> from the fathers of illegitimate children, whilst bringing up their children in a society where single parenthood and illegitimacy were stigmatised. This led to the practice of baby farming in which individuals acted as adoption or fostering agents, in return for regular payments or a single, up-front fee from the babies’ mothers. Many businesses were set up to take in these young women and care for them until they gave birth. The mothers subsequently left their unwanted babies to be looked after as [...] "nurse children".|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} was conducted {{of an open}} economy consisting of insatiable consumers. Some consumers can produce own goods to gain a profit while other consumers obtain an external support. The equilibrium is of a Walrassian type. The model takes into account an economy with monopolies and <b>financial</b> <b>obligations</b> of its subjects. The <b>financial</b> <b>obligations</b> lead to the capital redistribution between subjects of the economy. A formation of consumers' preferences depends on the <b>financial</b> <b>obligations.</b> There exists an equilibrium of such an economy. Obtained equilibrium values of model characteristics agree on an acceptable level of the consumption satisfaction of all economy subjects. The values of the capital redistribution are determined at which the levels of the consumption belong to the defined set of values. Based {{on the evolution of}} the <b>financial</b> <b>obligations,</b> the description of economy dynamics was proposed. ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ????????????? ???????, ????????? ?? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????. ????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????? ?? ???? ???????????? ????????????, ????????? ??????????? ????????????? ?? ??????? ??????????. ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ????. ?????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ????? ?????????????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ? ????????? ????????????? ???????. ?????????? ????????????? ???????? ? ????????????????? ???????? ? ????????????? ???????. ???????????? ??????????????? ???????????? ??????? ?? ?????????? ????????????. ??? ????? ????????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ????????????? ??????????. ??????? ???????? ????????????? ????????? ??????????, ??????????? ??? ???? ????????? ????????????? ??????? ?? ??????? ???????????. ?????????? ?????? ????????????????? ????????, ??? ??????? ?????? ??????????? ????? ?????????? ? ???????? ??????? ????????. ?? ???????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ???????...|$|R
2500|$|States may not {{exercise}} certain powers {{reserved for the}} federal government: they may not enter into treaties, alliances or confederations, grant letters of marque or reprisal, coin money or issue bills of credit (such as currency). Furthermore, no state may make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, which expressly forbids any state government (but not the federal government) from [...] "making a tender" [...] (i.e., authorizing something that may be offered in payment) of any type or form of money to meet any <b>financial</b> <b>obligation,</b> unless that form of money is coins made of gold or silver (or a medium of exchange backed by and redeemable in gold or silver coins, as noted in Farmers & Merchants Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank). Much of this clause is devoted to preventing the States from using or creating any currency other than that created by Congress. In Federalist no. 44, Madison explains that [...] "it may be observed that the same reasons which shew the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they {{ought not to be}} at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as States; and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded". Moreover, the states may not pass bills of attainder, enact ex post facto laws, impair the obligation of contracts, or grant titles of nobility.|$|E
2500|$|Alger Hiss {{was one of}} five {{children}} born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Mary [...] "Minnie" [...] Lavinia (née Hughes) and Charles Alger Hiss. Both parents came from substantial Baltimore families who could trace their roots {{to the middle of}} the eighteenth century. Hiss's paternal great-great grandfather had emigrated from Germany in 1729, married well, and changed his surname from [...] "Hesse" [...] to [...] "Hiss". Minnie Hughes had attended teacher's college and was active in Baltimore society. Shortly after his marriage at age 24, Charles Hiss entered the business world and joined the dry goods importing firm Daniel Miller and Co. He did well, becoming an executive and stockholder. When Charles's brother John died suddenly at age 33, Charles assumed financial and emotional responsibility for his brother's widow and six children in addition to his own expanding family. Charles also helped his wife's favorite brother, Albert Hughes, find work at Daniel Miller. Hughes at first distinguished himself and was promoted to treasurer of the firm, but then he became involved in a complicated business deal and was unable to meet the <b>financial</b> <b>obligation</b> that was part of a joint agreement. As a matter of honor, Charles Hiss felt compelled to sell all his stocks to make good his brother-in-law's debts, as well as to resign from the firm. This was in 1907, the year of a great financial panic. After inconclusive attempts by relatives to find him a job, Charles fell into a serious depression and committed suicide, cutting his throat with a razor. Minnie, who had made the most of her former prosperity and social position, now had to rely on her inheritance and assistance from family members.|$|E
2500|$|For the stadium's $321 million {{renovation}} {{and a new}} $153 million Student-Athlete High Performance Center, {{the university}} incurred a controversial $445 million of debt which it planned to finance with the sale of special stadium seats in the Endowment Seating Program. [...] Before {{the start of the}} stadium reconstruction, Professor Brian Barsky showed that the financial plan was unrealistic and calculated that although $215 million had been claimed to have been raised as of Jan. 15, 2010, the true figure was closer to only about $20 million as of Dec. 2010, and that the total <b>financial</b> <b>obligation</b> including interest would exceed a billion dollars. [...] His calculations were subsequently corroborated by the Wall Street Journal [...] which reported in April 2012 that only $31 million had been received as of the end of Dec. 2011; this was followed by further reporting of poor seat sales in the Endowment Seating Program. [...] As of June 30, 2016, the fund balance was $60.98 million, far short of the $215 million that had been claimed five years earlier. [...] The roughly $18 million interest-only annual payments on the debt consumes 20% of Cal's athletics' budget and 15% of the campus structural deficit; principal repayment begins in 2032 when the annual debt payment will rise to about $26 million per year, about $28 million in 2033, about $30 million per year for 2034-2038, and about $37 million per year for 2039-2044. [...] The debt payments are scheduled to continue for one hundred years from its 2013 inception, concluding in 2113. On November 3 2017, Chancellor Carol Christ announced that the university would overtake the earthquake retrofitting expenses part of the renovation. This amount is estimated to be approximately 60 percent of the total expenses or $200 million with the remaining expenses still being retained by the athletic department. Exactly where in the budget the funds would be taken was not announced, although the chancellor did state {{that they would not be}} taken out of student tuition or tax-payer funds for the university. It was not ruled out that the money could be taken out of funds for academic departments.|$|E

60|$|We {{have laid}} it {{down as a}} general {{principle}} that the private morals of an adult citizen are no concern for the State. But that involves a decision to disregard certain types of bargain. A sanely contrived State will refuse to sustain bargains wherein there is no plausibly fair exchange, and if private morality is really to be {{outside the scope of}} the State then the affections and endearments most certainly must not be regarded as negotiable commodities. The State, therefore, will absolutely ignore the distribution of these favours unless children, or at least the possibility of children, is involved. It follows that it will refuse to recognise any debts or transfers of property that are based on such considerations. It will be only consistent, therefore, to refuse recognition in the marriage contract to any <b>financial</b> <b>obligation</b> between husband and wife, or any settlements qualifying that contract, except when they are in the nature of accessory provision for the prospective children. [Footnote: Unqualified gifts for love by solvent people will, of course, be quite possible and permissible, unsalaried services and the like, provided the standard of life is maintained and the joint income of the couple between whom the services hold does not sink below twice the minimum wage.] So far the Utopian State will throw its weight upon the side of those who advocate the independence of women and their conventional equality with men.|$|E
