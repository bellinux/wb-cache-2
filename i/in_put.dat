Steen Eiler Rasmussen, a friend of Holden, commented that, with the expansive design, [...] "the London University is swallowing {{more and more of the}} old houses, and this quarter – which the Duke of Bedford laid out for good domestic houses – has taken on quite a different character."

2500|$|Her {{work is a}} {{cross between}} {{literary}} fiction and historical construction. She began to produce major works in the 1960s and her work matured in the 1970s, when she turned to producing works <b>in</b> <b>put</b> herself in solidarity {{with those who are}} oppressed politically and economically against those in power. Her work can be compared to that of Antonio Skármeta, Luis Rafael Sánchez, Marta Traba, Sergio Ramirez, Rosario Ferré, Manuel Puig and Fernando del Paso. Although most of her fame is as a journalist, she prefers creative writing. Her creative writings are philosophic meditations and assessments of society and the disenfranchised within it. Her writing style is free, lacking solemnity, colloquial and close. Many of her works are about deconstruction societal and political myths, but they also work to create new ones. For example, while she heavily criticizes the national institutions which evolved after the Mexican Revolution, she promotes a kind of [...] "popular heroism" [...] of the common person without name. Her works are also impregnated with a sense of fatalism.|$|E

This they cut, put their shoulders to the gunwale, and soon had her afloat. Then they scrambled <b>in,</b> <b>put</b> the oars out cautiously, and began to row.

60|$|Now Edmund, {{according}} to the story, was a humane and gentle-minded man, {{much more interested in}} deeds of benevolence and of piety than in warlike undertakings and exploits, and he was very far from being well prepared to meet this formidable foe. In fact, he sought refuge in a retired residence called Heglesdune. The Danes, having taken some Saxons captive in a city which they had sacked and destroyed, compelled them to make known the place of the king's retreat. Hinquar, the captain of the Danes, sent him a summons to come and surrender both himself and all the treasures of his kingdom. Edmund refused. Hinquar then laid siege to the palace, and surrounded it; and, finally, his soldiers, breaking <b>in,</b> <b>put</b> Edmund's attendants to death, and brought Edmund himself, bound, into Hinquar's presence.|$|E
