5|$|Assisting <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> Far Eastern Party {{would be}} Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Fusiliers, and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz. They {{were in charge of}} the expedition's sledge dogs—Greenland Huskies—who would be crucial if the party was to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended. Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges. Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the Aurora to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.|$|E
5|$|Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was {{addressed}} and refuted by the textual research of Paul Meyvaert, following whose work most scholars {{have come to}} accept the Libellus as a genuine letter of Gregory. The only portion of the Libellus that Meyvaert could not accept as genuine was the chapter on marriage, which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed {{could not have been}} written by Gregory. Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise genuine document. All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 has followed <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> point. In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored by Gregory, but he also explained exactly how it was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.|$|E

5|$|Nadodi Mannan was {{released}} on 22 August 1958. The expenses made for the film resulted in Ramachandran not having {{enough money to buy}} release prints. Hence, Veerappan and Chakrapani decided to acquire a legal loan of 50,000 from AVM Productions. However, Ramachandran's signature was required for the loan contract. When they consulted with <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> issue, he asked Veerappan and Chakrapani to tell the studio's founder A. V. Meiyappan that they would repay the loan and keep the price paid by the production company, Cinemas Limited, for distribution rights for the film's release in Sri Lanka as collateral. Meiyappan agreed to provide the loan, which was repaid by Veerappan immediately after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days later}} he {{received}} permission for another daylight sortie. Squadron Leader Robertson joined <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> occasion as his flight engineer. He flew to Lasham {{to pick up a}} Mosquito. His target on this occasion would be Denmark. The Luftwaffe kept a number of operational units in the region so he flew to Coltishall in Norfolk to be nearer his destination and conserve fuel during the sortie. Near Aalborg he sighted two aircraft. So far away from the battle zones, the Germans did not expect to be attacked by the enemy. Neither made much attempt to defend themselves. The first, a Junkers W 34 transport, was shot down and the second, a Junkers Ju 52, tried a crash-landing only to nose-over and crumple the wings. Braham strafed it to ensure destruction. His gun cameras filmed the action during which he fired 320 rounds. On 4 April he returned to France. Lacking radar, Braham sought out large airfields to be sure of intercepting an enemy aircraft. He flew to Bordeaux looking for He 177s that intelligence suggested were operating against Atlantic convoys from Bordeaux–Mérignac. Braham only encountered a Bücker Bü 131 which fell victim after a brief burst of fire.|$|E

25|$|According to al-Kindi, {{the goal}} of metaphysics is the {{knowledge}} of God. For this reason, he {{does not make a}} clear distinction between philosophy and theology, because he believes they are both concerned with the same subject. Later philosophers, particularly al-Farabi and Avicenna, would strongly disagree with <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> issue, by saying that metaphysics is actually concerned with being qua being, and as such, the nature of God is purely incidental.|$|E
25|$|In May 1686, James {{decided to}} obtain from the English courts {{of the common}} law a ruling that affirmed his power to {{dispense}} with Acts of Parliament.

When Henry Compton, the Bishop of London, did not ban John Sharp from preaching after he gave an anti-Catholic sermon, James ordered his removal.|$|E

25|$|After the aborted solo effort, Davies' solo {{career was}} not revived until 1980, {{with the release}} of Dave Davies (AFL1-3603), which {{featured}} Davies performing all the instruments by himself. The album, named after its own serial number, peaked at number 42 on the Billboard 200. He went on to release Glamour (1981), which charted at number 152. Davies brought in a back-up band to play with <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> record. Chosen People was released in 1983, but failed to crack the Billboard 200.|$|E
25|$|Success did not, however, always attend <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> campaign, and by {{imperial}} order he {{was relieved}} of his command by Li Hongzhang, who {{in the same way}} succeeded him as the Viceroy of Zhili, where, after the Tianjin Massacre (1870), Zeng failed to carry out the wishes of the imperial court. Instead of the desired policy towards foreigners, Zeng took on a more diplomatic stance. After this rebuff, he retired to his viceroyalty at Nanjing, where he died in 1872 mysteriously in Hong Xiuquan's former mansion.|$|E
25|$|Advice in 1945 when Hitler asked Dönitz {{whether the}} Geneva Convention should be denounced. Hitler's motives were twofold. The first was that {{reprisals}} {{could be taken}} against Western Allied prisoners of war; second, it would deter German forces from surrendering to the Western Allies (as was happening on the Eastern Front where the Geneva Convention was in abeyance). Instead of arguing the conventions should never be denounced, Dönitz suggested it was not expedient to do so, so the court found against <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> issue; but as the Convention was not denounced by Germany, and British prisoners in camps under Dönitz's jurisdiction were treated strictly according to the Convention, the Court considered these mitigating circumstances.|$|E

25|$|In 1902, Chattopadhyaya {{joined the}} University of Oxford, while {{preparing}} for the Indian Civil Service. Later, he became a law student of the Middle Temple. While frequenting Shyamji Krishna Varma's India House at 65 Cromwell Avenue in London, Chattopadhyaya became closely acquainted with V. D. Savarkar (since 1906). In 1907, Chattopadhyaya was on {{the editorial board of}} Shyamji's Indian Sociologist. In August, along with Madame Cama and S. R. Rana, he attended the Stuttgart Conference of the Second International where they met delegates including Henry Hyndman, Karl Liebknecht, Jean Jaurès, Rosa Luxemburg and Ramsay MacDonald, among others. Vladimir Lenin attended, but it is not certain if Chattopadhyaya met <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> occasion.|$|E
25|$|In modern Israel, early Zionists redefined Lag BaOmer from a rabbinic-oriented celebration to a {{commemoration}} of the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire (132–136 CE). According to work published by Yael Zerubavel of Rutgers University, a number of Lag BaOmer traditions were reinterpreted by Zionist ideologues {{to focus on the}} victory of the Bar Kokhba rebels rather than their ultimate defeat at Betar three years later. The plague that decimated Rabbi Akiva's 24,000 disciples was explained as a veiled reference to the revolt; the 33rd day when the plague ended was explained as the day of Bar Kokhba's victory. By the late 1940s, Israeli textbooks for schoolchildren painted Bar Kokhba as the hero while Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and Rabbi Akiva stood on the sidelines, cheering <b>him</b> <b>on.</b> <b>This</b> interpretation lent itself to singing and dancing around bonfires by night to celebrate Bar Kokhba's victory, and playing with bows and arrows by day to remember the actions of Bar Kokhba's rebel forces.|$|E
25|$|Callaghan {{was popular}} with Labour MPs and {{was elected to}} the Shadow Cabinet every year while the Labour Party was in {{opposition}} from 1951 to 1964. He was now a staunch Gaitskellite on the right wing. He was Parliamentary Adviser to the Police Federation from 1955 to 1960 when he negotiated an increase in police pay with the then general secretary Arthur Charles Evans. He ran for the Deputy Leadership of the party in 1960 as an opponent of unilateral nuclear disarmament, and despite the other candidate of the Labour right (George Brown) agreeing with <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> policy, he forced Brown to a second vote. In November 1961, Callaghan became shadow chancellor. When Hugh Gaitskell died in January 1963, Callaghan ran to succeed him, but came third in the leadership contest, which was won by Harold Wilson. However, he did gain the support of right-wingers, such as Denis Healey and Anthony Crosland, who wanted to prevent Wilson from being elected leader but who also did not trust George Brown.|$|E
