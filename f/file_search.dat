40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Supervisor in an Extended Data Management Facility (EDMF) is to direct the Facility 2 ̆ 7 s {{handling}} of a user 2 ̆ 7 s request for service. The Supervisor employs the five main functions of Access Controlling, Retrieval Optimizing, <b>File</b> <b>Searching,</b> Record Validating and Record Formatting {{in order to accomplish}} its task. This report is concerned mainly with the design and implementation of the <b>File</b> <b>Searching</b> and Record Validating Functions, although it also covers the Record Formatting Function. The <b>File</b> <b>Searching</b> and Record Validating Functions form that part of the Supervisor which actually controls the retrieval of records from the files of the EDMF. The major part of the report is concerned with discussing the <b>File</b> <b>Searching</b> Function because of the novel feature which has been implemented. This feature is the parallel processing of record lists in a generalized file structure, which eliminates redundant retrievals {{while at the same time}} reducing the access time of the device on which the records are stored. The Record Validating Function checks the record for compliance with the user 2 ̆ 7 s request and verifies the user 2 ̆ 7 s authority to access the record. A validated record is then subject to the Record Formatting Function which outputs it to the user...|$|R
