5|$|The major {{substantive}} {{criticisms of}} Satin's work have remained constant over time. His ideas are sometimes {{said to be}} superficial; they were characterized as childish in the 1960s, naive in the 1970s, poorly reasoned in the 1980s and 1990s, and overly simple in the 2000s. His ideas have also occasionally been seen as not politically serious, or as non-political {{in the sense of}} not being capable of challenging existing power structures. His work is sometimes said to be largely borrowed from others, a charge that first surfaced with regard to his <b>draft</b> <b>dodger</b> manual, and was repeated to varying degree by critics of his books on New Age politics and radical centrism.|$|E
5|$|In February 1967 1 ATF {{focused on}} the Dat Do area and the {{south-east}} of Phuoc Tuy province, initiating a program of conventional operations and pacification, with 5 RAR concentrating on cordon and search and civic action against Viet Cong cadres in the villages, while 6 RAR was tasked with search and destroy missions targeting the Viet Cong D445 Battalion. During the first week 6 RAR conducted ambushes along Route 23 between Dat Do and the Suoi Tre river, pre-empting Viet Cong attacks in the area during the Tet holiday. The results of this operation were modest, and the Australians suffered a number of casualties from a misplaced fire mission from the 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery which killed four and wounded 13, including Warrant Officer Class Two Jack Kirby, who had earlier received the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions at Long Tan, and was among the dead. Meanwhile, 5 RAR continued its cordon and search operations. On 13–14 February the battalion completed a cordon and search of An Nhut, just west of Dat Do, with South Vietnamese forces, apprehending 14 Viet Cong suspects, five communist sympathisers, two South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) deserters and a <b>draft</b> <b>dodger.</b> The Australians again suffered heavy casualties after the officer commanding C Company, his second-in-command, and a New Zealand artillery forward observer were killed by an unrecorded ARVN mine. Regardless, these operations met with some success, and over a six-day period the battalion captured 40 Viet Cong. Yet even as Graham continued to refine his strategy the Viet Cong struck, and this sudden initiative would force the Australians into the type of conventional engagement that Westmoreland had been advocating.|$|E

25|$|Krylenko {{returned}} to St. Petersburg in 1909, finishing his degree. He left the RSDLP in 1911, but soon rejoined it. He was drafted in 1912 and made Second Lieutenant before being discharged in 1913. After {{working as an}} assistant editor of Pravda and a liaison to the Bolshevik faction in the Duma for a few months, Krylenko was again arrested in 1913 and exiled to Kharkiv, where he received a law degree. In early 1914, Krylenko learned {{that he might be}} re-arrested and fled to Austria. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, he had to move to Switzerland as a Russian national. In the summer of 1915 Vladimir Lenin sent Krylenko back to Russia to help rebuild the Bolshevik underground organization. In November 1915 Krylenko was arrested in Moscow as a <b>draft</b> <b>dodger</b> and, after a few months in prison, sent to the South West Front in April 1916.|$|E
500|$|Such was her {{domination}} of the sport that there were persistent rumours that she was actually a man. These first surfaced immediately after her first match, when {{the members of the}} opposition Ottawa side accused her of being a man. The accusation was not unfounded in the league, where it was not uncommon for boys to be disguised as women to improve the spectacle. Some opposition teams went as far as removing Lapensée's hat during games to check how long her hair was. Her father made a public statement that the claims were false, and in February 1916, the Montreal Star investigated the claims. The reporter spoke to [...] "dozens and dozens of people from Cornwall who had known her since she was little", and concluded that [...] "from what he learned he is thoroughly convinced 'he' is a 'she'." [...] Despite this the rumours lingered, and some modern sources still speculate that she might have been a man. In 2011, an article in the Cornwall Standard Freeholder claimed that [...] "we'll never know if Albertine was actually an Albert", suggesting the possibility that Lapensée was actually a <b>draft</b> <b>dodger</b> named Albert.|$|E

500|$|According to author John Hagen, Toronto's then-mayor, William Dennison, was openly {{antagonistic}} to {{the influx}} of American hippies, draft resisters, and those who supported them who were coming to Canada in large numbers {{during the height of}} the Vietnam War. In his 2001 book, Northern Passage: American Vietnam War Resisters in Canada, Hagen wrote: [...] "The mayors of Canada's largest cities used the (War Measures Act) in a backlash against American war resisters." [...] Dennison stated: [...] "a few hippies and deserters are Toronto's only problem." [...] Mayor Jean Drapeau of Montreal asserted that military resisters were part of a [...] "revolutionary conspiracy." [...] Vancouver's mayor, Tom Campbell, commented: [...] "I don't like draft dodgers and I'll do anything within the law that allows me to get rid of them." [...] While all three men supported use of the War Measures Act to harass war resisters and hippies, Campbell was the most aggressive; he told the Toronto Star: [...] "I believe the law should be used against any revolutionary whether he's a US <b>draft</b> <b>dodger</b> or a hippie." [...] According to Hagen, the RCMP and the FBI cooperated in their effort to harass American war resisters during the late 1960s.|$|E

50|$|Eventually, many Iraq War resisters {{became aware}} of the history of <b>draft</b> <b>dodgers</b> being allowed into Canada without {{prosecution}} during the Vietnam War (1959-1975). In that era, most of those <b>draft</b> <b>dodgers</b> had simply applied for landed immigrant status once in Canada, which opposed its southern neighbour's military adventures in Vietnam. But immigration rules have been tightened since the Vietnam era, making would-be migrants apply from their home countries. This has pushed war resisters into Canada's refugee system.|$|R

50|$|Starting in 1965, Canada {{became a}} choice haven for American <b>draft</b> <b>dodgers</b> and deserters.Because {{they were not}} {{formally}} classified as refugees but were admitted as immigrants, there isno official estimate of how many <b>draft</b> <b>dodgers</b> and deserters were admitted to Canada during theVietnam War.
