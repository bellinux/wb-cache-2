In the winter, with the monsoon, you sail {{a little more}} than a month and then come to Ling-ya-mon, where one-third of the passing merchants put in before {{entering}} this country of Sanfotsi.A large proportion of the people are surnamed P'u. The people either live scattered about outside the city, or on the water on rafts of boards covered over with reeds, and these are exempt from taxation.They are skilled at fighting on land or water. When they are about to make war on another state they assemble and send forth such a force as the occasion demands. They appoint chiefs and leaders, and all provide their own military equipment and the necessary provisions. In facing the enemy and braving death they have not their equal among other nations.During most of the year the climate is hot, and there is but little cold weather. Their domestic animals are very much like those of China. They have <b>wine</b> <b>of</b> <b>flowers,</b> <b>wine</b> <b>of</b> coconuts, and <b>wine</b> <b>of</b> areca nuts and honey, all fermented, though without any yeast of any kind, but they are so intoxicating to drink.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{work was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} supplementation of honey as sole carbon source on the fermentation characteristics <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> fermented with fruit <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> cherry and honey(flowering cherry-honey <b>wine).</b> Physiochemical changes <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> cherry-honey wine(2 L) were investigated during 30 days in fermentation by strain of Saccharomyces bayanus (EC- 118). At {{the beginning of}} fermentation, fructose was most abundant sugar then glucose and sucrose were followed. As fermentation proceeded, utilization of glucose by S. bayanus (EC- 118) was faster than fructose, so that the ratio of fructose/glucose was increased. During fermentation for 30 days, pH and viable yeast count was changed rapidly between 0 to 5 days, while °Brix(%) decreased gradually for 30 days. Final total titratable acidity, pH, °Brix(%) and ethanol content <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> cherry-honey <b>wine</b> were 0. 43 %, pH 3. 5, 9. 7 °Brix(%) and 14 %, respectively.

50|$|According to Hiscox, the {{insecticide}} {{was obtained}} as follows:The powder is obtained by brushing the dried <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> the pellitory (pyrethrum). The leaves, too, are often used. (...) The active principle {{is not a}} volatile oil, as stated by some writers, but a rosin, which can be dissolved out from the dry <b>flowers</b> by means <b>of</b> ether. The leaves also contain this rosin but in. smaller proportions than the <b>flowers.</b> Tincture <b>of</b> pyrethrum is made by infusing the dried flowers in five times their weight of rectified spirit <b>of</b> <b>wine.</b> Diluted with water it {{is used as a}} lotion.(...)The dust resulting from the use of insect powder sometimes proves irritating to the mucous membranes of the one applying the powder.
