[...] The Chicago Tribune noted Schwa's initial menu did just that, {{featuring}} [...] "a soft-boiled organic egg coated in brioche, served with potato puree and Illinois sturgeon caviar". [...] Within weeks, the restaurant had garnered a strong buzz among local foodies. [...] National press attention quickly followed, including Carlson receiving [...] "Best New Chef" [...] honors from Food & Wine magazine, as Schwa {{earned a reputation}} for <b>great</b> <b>food</b> and an innovative chef-customer relationship.

[...] It was {{completed}} 11 {{years after the}} publication of her previous autobiography, A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002), and over thirty years after she wrote her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969). [...] Mom & Me & Mom, in which Angelou relates her relationship with her mother Vivian Baxter, was published shortly before Mother's Day and Angelou's 85th birthday. [...] In the time period between the publication of her sixth and seventh autobiographies, Angelou was the first African-American woman and living poet selected by Sterling Publishing, who placed 25 of her poems in a volume of their Poetry for Young People series in 2004. In 2009, Angelou wrote [...] "We Had Him", a poem about Michael Jackson, which was read by Queen Latifah at his funeral, [...] and wrote [...] "His Day is Done", a poem honoring Nelson Mandela after his death in 2013.

40|$|Over half of {{foodborne}} illness outbreaks occur in restaurants. To combat these outbreaks, many public health agencies require food safety certification for restaurant managers, and sometimes workers. Certification entails passing a food safety knowledge examination, which is typically preceded by food safety training. Current certification efforts {{are based on}} the assumption that certification leads to <b>greater</b> <b>food</b> safety knowledge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted this study to examine the relationship between food safety knowledge and certification. We also examined the relationships between food safety knowledge and restaurant, manager, and worker characteristics. We interviewed managers (N= 387) and workers (N= 365) about their characteristics and assessed their food safety knowledge. Analyses showed that certified managers and workers had <b>greater</b> <b>food</b> safety knowledge than noncertified managers and workers. Additionally, managers and workers whose primary language was English had <b>greater</b> <b>food</b> safety knowledge than those whose primary language was not English. Other factors associated with <b>greater</b> <b>food</b> safety knowledge included working in a chain restaurant, working in a larger restaurant, having more experience, and having more duties. These findings indicate that certification improves food safety knowledge, and that complex relationships exist among restaurant, manager, and worker characteristics and food safety knowledge.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{empirical}} {{case study of}} the potential for urban gardening to contribute to individual food security. Food security generally encompasses both availability and accessibility. In Western Europe, availability per se has declined in importance with the development of national and international transportation networks. During the past decade, urban gardening has gained political currency as a strategy to provide <b>greater</b> <b>food</b> security at the local level. However, prevailing economic and social structures hamper the likelihood that urban gardening might offer much <b>greater</b> <b>food</b> security. Realistically, contemporary urban gardening most closely resembles a middle-class pursuit for personal enjoyment...|$|R
