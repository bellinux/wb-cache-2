5|$|<b>Dalton</b> {{taught for}} sixty years. She taught her pupils energetically {{in spite of}} having crude {{educational}} resources. In 1891, <b>Dalton</b> encouraged other women teachers {{to ask for a}} raise. The board of education did give the teachers a raise, but considered <b>Dalton</b> responsible for their petitioning and demanded that she pay the difference from her salary. When <b>Dalton</b> refused, they replaced her with a male teacher. Luckily, the city of Payson requested that <b>Dalton</b> teach at their school, and she moved there happily. Later she taught in Ogden and Manti. She served as an officer of the territorial women's suffrage association. Her sister Rose was vice-president of the Utah State Chapter of Women Voters.|$|E

5|$|Code of Vengeance is the {{umbrella}} title {{for a series}} of American television programs, produced by Universal Television, that aired on NBC in 1985 and 1986.

5|$|<b>Dalton</b> also {{believed}} atomic theory {{could explain why}} water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen. <b>Dalton</b> hypothesized {{this was due to}} the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).|$|E
5|$|<b>Dalton</b> prompts Maureen {{to hide in}} a closet, {{after hearing}} her fellow Bunny Carol-Lynne {{entering}} his condo. The couple begins to flirt and kiss, only to abruptly end after Carol-Lynne discovers a bunny outfit of a coworker.

Carol-Lynne immediately leaves Dalton's condo, and Maureen returns to the Playboy Mansion with her coworkers. The following day, the club's manager Billy Rosen, speaks with the Bunnies regarding the whereabouts of Bianchi. Rosen later finds Carol-Lynne in his office, much to his surprise.

40|$|The intragenic {{organization}} of ribosomal DNA from a diploid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was analyzed by using recombinant DNA molecules constructed in vitro.

40|$|The DNA of {{herpesvirus}} pan, a primate B-lymphotropic herpesvirus, shares {{about 40}} % well-conserved sequence relatedness with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and herpesvirus papio DNAs. Labeled cloned fragments from the EBV recombinant DNA library were cross hybridized to blots of EcoRI, XbaI, and BamHI restriction endonuclease fragments of herpesvirus pan DNA {{to identify and}} map homologous sequences in the herpesvirus pan genome. Regions of colinear homology were demonstrated between 6 x 10 (6) <b>daltons</b> and 108 x 10 (6) <b>daltons</b> in the DNAs. The structural organization of herpesvirus pan DNA {{was similar to the}} format of Epstein-Barr virus and herpesvirus papio DNAs. The DNA consists of two domains of largely unique sequence complexity, a segment US of 9 x 10 (6) <b>daltons</b> and a segment UL of 88 x 10 (6) <b>daltons.</b> US and UL are separated by a variable number of tandem repetitions of a sequence IR (2 x 10 (6) <b>daltons).</b> There was homology between DNA which mapped at 26 to 28 x 10 (6) <b>daltons</b> and 93 to 95 x 10 (6) <b>daltons</b> in UL. The terminal reiteration component, TR, of herpesvirus pan DNA and sequences which mapped to the left of 6 x 10 (6) <b>daltons</b> and to the right of 108 x 10 (6) <b>daltons</b> had no detectable homology with the corresponding regions of Epstein-Barr virus DNA...|$|R
40|$|Disaggregation of {{wild-type}} and Re chemotype lipopolysaccharides (LPS) {{has been}} accomplished by solubilization with triethylamine followed by stabilization with bovine serum albumin {{in order to determine}} the degree of aggregation. Solubilization with 1. 5 % triethylamine was found to be more effective than with lower concentrations, as judged by permeation chromatography. Chromatographic analysis of triethylamine-bovine serum albumin-disaggregated LPS showed a range of particle sizes. Wild-type LPS yielded size classes of 1 X 10 (6) to 4 X 10 (6) <b>daltons,</b> 250, 000 <b>daltons,</b> and 20, 000 <b>daltons.</b> Re LPS yielded size classes of 1 X 10 (6) to 4 X 10 (6) <b>daltons</b> and 20, 000 <b>daltons.</b> Untreated LPS was always greater than 4 X 10 (6) <b>daltons.</b> Chemical characterization of the size classes revealed 3 -keto- 2 -deoxyoctonate in all size classes and suggests that the O-antigenic side chain length may determine the aggregate size in solubilized LPS...|$|R
