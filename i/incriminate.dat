5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 28 April 2012, Martínez Pérez was murdered inside her home in Xalapa after being {{severely}} beaten. A suspect was arrested in October 2012 and publicly confessed to the murder, while the Mexican authorities concluded that the motive of the murder was theft. But the suspect later retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured and threatened by officials to lie and admit to the murder. Investigators have relied solely on the suspect's confession to <b>incriminate</b> him; the DNA and fingerprint samples collected at the murder scene did not match the suspect's according to sources close to Committee to Protect Journalists.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Gabi Ben Harosh, {{partner of}} the Abergil brothers, was arrested in Los Angeles. After two years of house arrest, he signed a plea bargain for minor offenses, {{connected}} to bringing in foreign currency without a permit, {{and was sentenced to}} community service and judicial supervision for three years. In view of the Abergil brothers extradition to the US, {{he and his wife were}} arrested for violating immigration laws. It is believed that American authorities tried to apply pressure to Ben Harosh to <b>incriminate</b> the Abergil brothers but failed.|$|E
5|$|In November 1792 James Reynolds and his {{associate}} Jacob Clingman {{were arrested}} for counterfeiting and speculating in veteran back wages. Clingman was released on bail and relayed information to James Monroe that Reynolds had evidence that would <b>incriminate</b> Hamilton. Monroe consulted with Congressmen Muhlenberg and Venable on what actions to take and the Congressmen confronted Hamilton on December 15, 1792. Hamilton refuted the suspicions of speculation by exposing his affair with Maria and producing as evidence the letters by both Reynoldses, proving that his payments to James Reynolds related to blackmail over his adultery, and not to treasury misconduct. The trio were to keep the documents privately with the utmost confidence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{definition}} of [...] "deliberate elicitation" [...] {{is not the}} same as the {{definition of}} [...] "interrogation" [...] under the Miranda rule. Miranda interrogation includes express questioning and any actions or statements that an officer would reasonably foresee as likely to cause an <b>incriminating</b> response. Massiah applies to express questioning and any attempt to deliberately and intentionally obtain <b>incriminating</b> information from the defendant regarding the crime charged. The difference is purposeful creation of an environment likely to produce <b>incriminating</b> information (Massiah) and action likely to induce an <b>incriminating</b> response even if that was not the officer's purpose or intent (Miranda).|$|R
40|$|This {{analysis}} considers outputs {{produced by}} Title III electronic wiretaps. Based on 1987 - 2005 data, wiretap productivity is assessed {{by examining the}} number of wiretaps, places wiretaps are installed, numbers of people whose communications are intercepted, the number of intercepted communications, the number of communications labeled <b>incriminating,</b> the arrests and convictions linked to wiretaps, and the relationships among arrests and convictions. Wiretapping is focused mostly on narcotics violations. The numbers of people, interceptions, and <b>incriminating</b> interceptions increased. One-fifth of intercepted communications were classified as <b>incriminating.</b> <b>Incriminating</b> information is linked to arrests and convictions that unfold over time. The more people intercepted, the more arrests result, but convictions decline over time. Arrests are driven {{by the number of}} intercepted persons. Convictions are driven by the number of <b>incriminating</b> interceptions. Two simultaneous but opposing operations were in place by 2005 : big increases in the number of intercepted communications in 2003 through 2005; and by 2005, overall declines in the measured productivity of wiretaps. ...|$|R

5|$|In Washington, D.C., Chris Whitley (Kris Lemche) {{is ordered}} by the conspirators who fund Juma's militia to erase all {{information}} that would <b>incriminate</b> them. Instead, he calls his friend Roger Taylor (Eric Lively), the son of President Elect Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones), for help. After Roger hears of the conspiracy, Whitley returns to his home to forward the files, only to be stopped by Hodges's men, Halcott and John Quinn (Sebastian Roche) who take the information, kill Whitley and bury the body in concrete.|$|E
5|$|Garza, {{troubled by}} what he had done, confessed to the police that he acted as a {{middleman}} in Fischer's murder. He cooperated with the police to <b>incriminate</b> Martínez, who then aided in Cisneros' arrest. Cisneros and Garza were eventually {{sentenced to life in}} prison by a state court in 1994, but Cisneros' sentence was overturned due to a legal technicality. She was convicted again in 1998 by a federal court and {{sentenced to life in prison}}. Martínez was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty and testifying against the two in court. Though U.S. officials tried to have the two assassins extradited, the hitmen never faced trial in Texas. They were prosecuted in Mexico and given a 15-year sentence.|$|E
5|$|In April 1839, the {{accusation}} of poisoning the young prince in 1837, {{along with two}} other fabricated cases, was revived against Bhimsen and his party, and forged papers and evidence were produced professing to <b>incriminate</b> him. Bhimsen appealed for justice and tried to defend himself, but the King, blindly believing the forgeries, denounced him as a traitor {{and put him in}} house arrest in a room at the ground floor of his own Bagh Durbar. Although pardon had already been given, based on these forged evidence, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay were again arrested and tortured. Except for Mathabar Singh, who managed to escape to India, rest of the Thapa family were again arrested, their properties confiscated, were declared outcasts, and were proclaimed to be expelled from every public offices for seven generations.|$|E

5|$|Spider-Man 3 {{picks up}} {{one year after}} the events of the second film. Peter is still seeing Mary Jane Watson, while Harry Osborn succeeds his father as the new Green Goblin. Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who like Peter is a {{photographer}} for the Daily Bugle, sets out to defame Spider-Man and <b>incriminate</b> him. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict, falls into a particle accelerator and becomes a shape-shifting sand monster later known as Sandman. Peter later learns that Marko is the one that killed Uncle Ben, causing Peter's own dark intentions to grow. This vendetta is enhanced by the appearance of the mysterious black alien symbiotic substance that bonds to Peter, resulting in the formation of a new black costume. Once Peter separates himself from the alien, it finds a new host in the form of Brock, resulting in the creation of Venom.|$|E
5|$|John Kramer's widow Jill Tuck meets Matt Gibson, an {{internal}} affairs detective from the precinct where Detective Mark Hoffman works. She incriminates Hoffman {{in exchange for}} protection and immunity from prosecution. Gibson, who has distrusted Hoffman ever since he saved his life by gunning down a homeless man, agrees to her terms. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a skinhead gang – Dan, Evan, Jake and Kara – and places them in a junkyard trap that kills them all, leaving the reverse bear trap at the scene to <b>incriminate</b> Jill, who is later put into protective custody. After a meeting of Jigsaw survivors, including Lawrence Gordon, who cauterized his leg on a steam pipe after escaping the bathroom and now uses a cane and prosthetic foot, Hoffman abducts Bobby Dagen, a self-help guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying his own survival story. He sends Gibson some videos with cryptic clues to the game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, the {{legislature}} and local press started questioning {{the actions of the}} Puerto Rico Police, the Puerto Rico Justice Department, the U.S. Justice Department, and the FBI actions during the first investigation, alleging corruption within the agencies and a conspiracy to cover-up evidence. Letters were sent by various community and political leaders to then Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Edward M. Kennedy, asking for an inquiry into the conduct of the Federal investigations. Several letters even accused former US Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti of providing aid to Gov. Romero Barceló during the investigations. Two leaders from the opposing parties, the Popular Democratic Party and the Puerto Rican Independence Party, charged that after a December 1979 meeting between the two, the Governor, then considered as a lifelong Republican, began campaigning to deliver the 41 Democratic Party convention votes of the island for President Jimmy Carter's (D) nomination for the presidency (ironically, Carter’s opponent for the nomination was Senator Kennedy). Almost 45 days after President Carter won the nomination by only one delegate, the U.S. Justice Department announced that due to lack of evidence it was bringing its investigation of the case to an end. A Justice Department internal memorandum that was issued the same month of Romero Barceló’s and Civiletti’s meeting later proved that the investigations were closed even when agents were still investigating important evidence of the case that could potentially <b>incriminate</b> the officers, including “several unexplained contusions” on a victim's face and the fact that one of the police officers recanted his original story, stating that there was in fact “two bursts of firing”.|$|E
