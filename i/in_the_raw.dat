One physician maintained that Jamal's scars were not from bullet wounds, but dated back to an injury he sustained in the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} the event was that the two main event matches, one each for the World Heavyweight Championship and the WWE Championship, would occur in an Elimination Chamber. Each match {{featured}} six competitors: the defending champion and five challengers. Sheamus defended the WWE Championship against Triple H, Ted DiBiase, Randy Orton, John Cena, and Kofi Kingston <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Raw</b> Elimination Chamber. In the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match, The Undertaker defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Chris Jericho, John Morrison, Rey Mysterio, CM Punk, and R-Truth. On the undercard, Drew McIntyre defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Kane, The Miz defended the WWE United States Championship against Montel Vontavious Porter, and Maryse and Gail Kim competed against LayCool (Layla and Michelle McCool) in an interbrand Divas tag team match.|$|E

On the 900th episode of Raw, he disqualified himself, in the main event in a five-on-five elimination match against The Nexus. This saw him enter into a feud with the anonymous Raw General Manager, during which the general manager cost him several matches. At Night of Champions, Edge participated in a six-pack elimination challenge for Sheamus' WWE Championship, but once again failed to win the title.|$|E

On the September 20 episode of Raw, Christy was announced as {{the winner of the}} Diva Search and received a one-year contract with WWE and $250,000. After the Diva Search, Carmella became a villainess and began a feud with Christy, due to jealousy of Christy winning the Diva Search. On the last edition of Raw before Taboo Tuesday, it was announced that Christy and Carmella would face each other at the pay-per-view with the fans choosing what type of match they would compete in. The choices were a Lingerie Pillow Fight, an Evening Gown Match, or an Aerobics Challenge. After the announcement was made, Carmella attacked Christy.|$|E

25|$|A {{colourant}} or opacifier – These can be naturally {{present in}} the glass due to impurities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> materials or can be deliberately added to the melted glass as minerals or as slag from metalworking processes. The most important contributions are from iron, copper, cobalt, manganese, tin, antimony, and lead. Opacity can be due to bubbles in the glass or the inclusion of opacifying agents such as tin and antimony. The resulting colour and opacity from a given composition also may be controlled by the temperature and redox conditions inside the furnace.|$|E
25|$|The siting of glass-making {{workshops}} was {{governed by}} three primary factors: {{the availability of}} fuel which was needed in large quantities, sources of sand which represented the major constituent of the glass, and natron {{to act as a}} flux. Roman glass relied on natron from Wadi El Natrun, and as a result it is thought that glass-making workshops during the Roman period may have been confined to near-coastal regions of the eastern Mediterranean. This facilitated the trade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> colourless or naturally coloured glass which they produced, which reached glass-working sites across the Roman empire.|$|E

Thus a reduction of the original particle size well below the wavelength of visible light (~500nm) eliminates much of the light scattering, resulting in a translucent or even transparent material.|$|E

The sedimentary group ranged in density from 0. 82 to 1 - 85 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dried <b>raw</b> clay, and 1. 93 to 2 - 63 when fired. The hydrothermally altered clays ranged from 1. 83 to 2. 50 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dried <b>raw</b> state, and 2. 02 to 2. 66 when fired.

25|$|Bags {{of cement}} {{routinely}} have {{health and safety}} warnings printed on them because not only is cement highly alkaline, but the setting process is exothermic. As a result, wet cement is strongly caustic (water pH = 13.5) and can easily cause severe skin burns if not promptly washed off with water. Similarly, dry cement powder in contact with mucous membranes can cause severe eye or respiratory irritation. Some trace elements, such as chromium, from impurities naturally present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>raw</b> materials used to produce cement may cause allergic dermatitis. Reducing agents such as ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) are often added to cement to convert the carcinogenic hexavalent chromate (CrO42−) into trivalent chromium (Cr3+), a less toxic chemical species. Cement users need also to wear appropriate gloves and protective clothing.|$|E
