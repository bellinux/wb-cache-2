5|$|Illinois Attorney General Edward Brundage and State's Attorney Hoyne {{gathered}} {{evidence to}} prepare for a Grand Jury investigation. The stated intention was to pursue all perpetrators and to seek the death penalty as necessary. On August 4, 1919, seventeen indictments against African Americans were <b>handed</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the most}} recent Third Amendment {{decision}} <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> by a federal court, on February 2, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Nevada held in Mitchell v. City of Henderson that the Third Amendment {{does not apply to}} intrusions by municipal police officers since they are not soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Baldur {{was sentenced}} to {{mandatory}} 2 years in prison by the District Court of Reykjavík for insider trading. The proceeds of the trade, 192 million ISK (including capital gains tax), were confiscated. The case was remitted to the Supreme Court of Iceland which upheld the ruling. It {{was the first time}} a conviction was <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> by a court for insider trading in Iceland.|$|E

When they contended it was a trick, a trained muscular knack, he challenged them to another test.|$|R
5|$|Four ancient {{straight}} swords (chokutō) and one tsurugi <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> {{in possession}} of temples and shrines have been designated as National Treasure craft items. A notable collection of 55 swords and other weapons from the 8th century have been preserved in the Shōsōin collection. Being {{under the supervision of}} the Imperial Household Agency, neither these items nor the well known Kogarasu Maru are National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|In Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Dabit (2005), Sotomayor wrote a {{unanimous}} {{opinion that the}} Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 did not preempt class action claims in state courts by stockbrokers alleging misleading inducement {{to buy or sell}} stocks. The Supreme Court <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> an 8–0 decision stating that the Act did preempt such claims, thereby overruling Sotomayor's decision.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 2008, the High Court <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> its {{ruling on}} Odex's appeal. It held that Pacific Internet had {{to release the}} names of the alleged illegal downloaders {{directly}} to the Japanese anime studios. In the light of this decision, Peter Go said that the company's role would shift from active enforcement to assisting the studios in their possible courses of action.|$|E

5|$|On January 19, 2011, {{a federal}} grand jury <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> an {{indictment}} for three counts against Loughner for the attempt to assassinate Representative Giffords, and attempting to kill two federal employees, her aides Ron Barber and Pamela Simon. Loughner was indicted on additional charges of murder and attempted murder on March 3, for a total of 49 counts.|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> its {{ruling in}} Brown v. Board of Education, {{in which the}} {{unanimous}} court held that separate public schools for {{black and white students}} was unconstitutional. Although agitation for an end to racial segregation in schools (and society at large) had been building in the United States since the end of World War II, Brown sparked the modern American civil rights movement.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court granted certiorari in January 1987, and {{the case}} was argued on October 13, 1987. On January 13, 1988, the court <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> its decision, {{overturning}} the circuit court in a 5-3 ruling. Its majority opinion set a precedent that school-sponsored activities, including student newspapers and drama productions, are not normally protected from administrative censorship under the First Amendment.|$|E

5|$|The open {{right hand}} of the monk is {{interpreted}} as an oath-making gesture, or a blessing gesture in Christian tradition. The red book in the left hand refers to the oath book of the city (in accordance with the gesture of the right hand), or the municipal law book which is bounded in red and has been <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> since 1365. Another interpretation {{is that it is}} a gospel book.|$|E
5|$|A $30,000 supersedeas bond {{was issued}} in August 1965 as the United Bond Insurance Company {{continued}} to dispute {{the payment of}} Kinne's original $25,000 bond. The supersedeas bond allowed the company to defer payment of the $25,000 bond until a ruling on the matter was <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> by the Missouri Supreme Court, but when that court upheld the bond's forfeiture, the $25,000 was paid to the State of Missouri in October 1965. The United Bond Insurance Company later filed suit against Kinne's family to recover {{the cost of the}} bail, lawyer's fees, and searching for Kinne after her escape.|$|E
5|$|Another one of Heffron's {{election}} promises, namely a Royal Commission {{into the}} legalisation of off-course betting, caused considerable tension {{with his own}} cabinet. His Attorney General Reg Downing favoured its legalisation through a government-supervised Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) while his Chief Secretary Gus Kelly favoured legalising the activities of existing SP bookmakers. Downing however, went over Heffron's head and procured an ALP State Executive order requiring {{the establishment of a}} TAB. When the Final Report of Commission was <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> on 29 March 1963, echoing the position of Downing, Heffron was obliged to carry out the establishment of the TAB.|$|E

5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, {{judgments}} <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> by the courts are considered a source of law. Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this {{influence}} plus their academic training from Rimsky-Korsakov, especially in the cases of Anton Arensky and Glazunov, these composers combined the best compositional techniques of The Five and Tchaikovsky in their music. Often, however, composers in this group fell back on two sources—musical clichés and mannerisms <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> from The Five, and academic compositional techniques learned at the Conservatory. Also, the eclecticism about which Rimsky-Korsakov wrote tended to overpower originality in many works, including those of Glazunov. Nevertheless, the Belyayev circle continued to influence the development of Russian music well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{the album}} became {{exclusively}} available to iTunes Stores, Sony Music Entertainment <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> an edict that forbade retailers to put the album up for pre-order, as to further protect the exclusivity with iTunes. It was then reported that US retailers Target and Amazon refused to sell the physical copy of the album. According to a Target spokesperson, the store was only interested in retailing albums which were released digitally and physically simultaneously. On December 21, 2013, all the videos from the album were screened at the SVA Theater in New York.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{settlement}} recognising {{his claim to}} Morley's music patent, Barley seemingly {{found it difficult to}} enforce his rights, even with his new role as a stationer. Less than half of the known music books published from 1606 to 1613 recognised Barley's rights on the imprint. Barley took Thomas Adams to the Stationers' court in 1609, challenging the copyrights of the music books Adams had published. The court <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> a settlement similar to the one between East and Barley. However, none of the music books Adams published afterward contained any recognition of Barley's patent.|$|E
5|$|In March 1904, Beckham {{signed the}} Day Law mandating racial {{segregation}} of all schools in Kentucky. Berea College, a private college in eastern Kentucky {{that had been}} integrated since the 1850s, immediately filed suit to challenge the law. The substance of the law was upheld in the circuit court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Berea appealed to the Supreme Court, and in 1908 the court <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> an 81 decision against the college. Only John Marshall Harlan dissented.|$|E
5|$|Other {{government}} {{decisions in}} 1929 had attracted controversy as well. Page <b>handed</b> <b>down</b> his last budget on 22 August, which hinted at the burgeoning debt crisis and {{introduced a new}} tax on entertainment and theatres to help cover the deficit. The tax was very unpopular with the public, and the entertainment industry mounted a vocal campaign to stop it. Bruce, supported by the Brigden Report of 1929, also raised concern that protective tariffs were too high and were in need of reform a position controversial with the powerful protected industries.|$|E
