The technique {{can be incorporated into}} naturally occurring conversations and is readily understood by informants. It also generates more information about the similarity between items than do standard free-listing tasks and allows investigators to better describe intracultural variation among infor-mants. Data from Yoder’s ethnomedical study of childhood diarrhea in Zaire are used to demonstrate how the technique works and how the data can be analyzed. The authors warn that successive <b>free</b> <b>listing</b> is not a substitute for more formal frame substitute techniques, and investigators may wish to use the technique early in the research process to systematically explore and describe the multiple relationships between items in a domain. <b>Free</b> <b>listing</b> is a common elicitation technique in the social sciences (Weller and Romney 1988; Bernard 1994; Borgatti 1999).

40|$|<b>Free</b> <b>listing</b> is a methodological {{tool that}} {{is widely used}} in various {{scientific}} disciplines. A typical assumption {{of this approach is}} that individual lists reflect a subset of total knowledge and that the first items listed are the most culturally important. However, little is known about how cognitive processes influence <b>free</b> <b>lists.</b> In this study, we assess how recent memory of use, autonoetic and anoetic memory, and long-term associative memory can affect the composition and order of items in <b>free</b> <b>lists</b> and evaluate whether <b>free</b> <b>lists</b> indicate the most important items. Based on a model of local knowledge about medicinal plants and their therapeutic targets, which was collected via individual semi-structured interviews, we classify each item recorded in <b>free</b> <b>lists</b> according to the last time that the item was used by the informant (recently or long ago), the type of relevant memory (autonoetic or anoetic memory) and the existing associations between therapeutic targets (similar or random). We find that individuals have a tendency to recall information about medicinal plants used during the preceding year and that the recalled plants were also the most important plants during this period. However, we find no trend in the recall of plants from long-term associative memory, although this phenomenon is well established in studies on cognitive psychology. We suggest that such evidence should be considered in studies that use lists of medicinal plants because this temporal cognitive limit on the retrieval of knowledge affects data interpretation...|$|R

60|$|The {{question}} of the feasibility of the Anarchist proposals in regard to distribution is, {{like so many other}} questions, a quantitative one. The Anarchist proposals consist of two parts: (1) That all the common commodities should be supplied ad lib. to all applicants; (2) That no obligation to work, or economic reward for work, should be imposed on anyone. These two proposals are not necessarily inseparable, nor does either entail the whole system of Anarchism, though without them Anarchism would hardly be possible. As regards the first of these proposals, it can be carried out even now with regard to some commodities, and it could be carried out in no very distant future with regard to many more. It is a flexible plan, since this or that article of consumption could be placed on the <b>free</b> <b>list</b> or taken of as circumstances might dictate. Its advantages are many and various, and the practice of the world tends to develop in this direction.

60|$|I {{have just}} been {{witnessing}} a remarkable play, here at the Burg Theatre in Vienna. I do not know of any play that much resembles it. In fact, {{it is such a}} departure from the common laws of the drama that the name 'play' doesn't seem to fit it quite snugly. However, whatever else it may be, it is in any case a great and stately metaphysical poem, and deeply fascinating. 'Deeply fascinating' is the right term: for the audience sat four hours and five minutes without thrice breaking into applause, except at the close of each act; sat rapt and silent--fascinated. This piece is 'The Master of Palmyra.' It is twenty years old; yet I doubt if you have ever heard of it. It is by Wilbrandt, and is his masterpiece and the work which is to make his name permanent in German literature. It has never been played anywhere except in Berlin and in the great Burg Theatre in Vienna. Yet whenever it is put on the stage it packs the house, and the <b>free</b> <b>list</b> is suspended.

40|$|Childhood obesity affects {{nearly one}} in ten preschool-age {{children}} placing them at risk for adverse health outcomes. Obesity is often attributed to behaviors of eating either large quantities of food and/or energy dense, non-nutritious foods. Behavior, itself, {{is thought to be}} underpinned and motivated by beliefs/tacit knowledge. As such, what preschool-age children know about eating may partly be explained by their personal beliefs or their concepts about food. However, little is known about preschool-age children’s concepts related to food and the organization of these concepts. The purpose of this portion of a larger mixed-methods study exploring preschool-age children’s beliefs/tacit knowledge about eating was to reveal their concepts related to food and the organization of these concepts with those who were obese and those who were of healthy weight. 	<b>Free</b> <b>lists</b> and card sorts embedded within an ethnographic interview were used to elicit preschool-age children’s responses that revealed their concepts related to food and the organization of these concepts. Sixty preschool-age children, 30 who were obese and 30 who were of healthy weight, participated in this study. There {{were no significant differences in}} what children from both groups typically knew about food. However, there were modest differences in the food items that were representative of each group. Results from the analysis of the card sort found that preschool-age children who were obese and children who were of healthy weight organize their concepts related to food differently. 	<b>Free</b> <b>listing</b> is a technique where participants are asked to “Tell me all the _____ you can think of. ” In contrast, card sorts is a technique where participants are asked to sort cards.

As a result, <b>free</b> <b>lists</b> and card sorts are two simple, yet powerful, trustworthy, and complimentary ethnographic elicitation techniques that can be used with preschool-age children to gain insight into their concepts related to food and the organization of these concepts...|$|R

In a conservation-education context, we applied CCT and used <b>free</b> <b>lists</b> (i. e., a list of items on a topic stated in order of cultural importance) and domain analysis (analysis of how <b>free</b> <b>lists</b> go together within a cultural group) to evaluate a conservation education program in which we used a children’s picture book to increase knowledge about and empathy for a critically endangered mammal, the Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus). We extracted <b>free</b> <b>lists</b> of keywords generated by students (n= 580 in 18 schools) from essays they wrote before and after the education program. In 2 classroom sessions conducted approximately 18 weeks apart, we asked students to write an essay about their knowledge of the target species and then presented a book and several activities about slow loris ecology. Prior to the second session, we asked students to write a second essay. We generated <b>free</b> <b>lists</b> from both essays, quantified salience of terms used, and conducted minimal residuals factor analysis to determine presence of cultural domains surrounding slow lorises in each session. Students increased their use of words accurately associated with slow loris ecology and conservation from 43 % in initial essays to 76 % in final essays. Domain coherence increased from 22 % to 47 % across schools. Fifteen factors contributed to the domain slow loris. Between the first and second essays, factors that showed the greatest change were feeding ecology and slow loris as a forest protector, which increased 7 -fold, and the humancentric factor, which decreased 5 -fold. As demonstrated by knowledge retention and creation of unique stories and conservation opinions, children achieved all six levels of Bloom’s taxonomy of learning domains.
