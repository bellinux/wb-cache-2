The configuration {{used for this study}} was designed by the Douglas Aircraft Company during the 1970 's. A 0. 1 -scale model of this configuration was tested in the Langley 30 - by 60 -Foot Tunnel with both the original leading-edge flap system and a new leading-edge flap system, which was designed with modem computational flow analysis and optimization tools. Leading-and trailing-edge <b>flap</b> <b>deflections</b> were generated for the original and modified leading-edge flap systems with the computational flow analysis and optimization tools. Although wind tunnel data indicated improvements in aerodynamic performance for the analytically derived <b>flap</b> <b>deflections</b> for both leading-edge flap systems, perturbations of the analytically derived leading-edge <b>flap</b> <b>deflections</b> yielded significant additional improvements in aerodynamic performance. In addition to the aerodynamic performance optimization testing, stability and control data were also obtained. An evaluation of the crosswind landing capability of the aircraft configuration revealed that insufficient lateral control existed as a result of high levels of lateral stability. Deflection of the leading-and trailing-edge flaps improved the crosswind landing capability of the vehicle considerably; however, additional improvements are required...|$|R

The experimental data were compared with the aerodynamic characteristics estimated using Newtonian theory, thus establishing the usefulness of these predictions. The candidate AMOOS configurations selected for the wind tunnel tests were the AMOOS 5 B and HB configurations. Two flap configurations were tested for each candidate - a forward or compression surface flap and an aft or expansion flap. Photographs and sketches of the two configurations with different control surfaces are shown. It was determined that Newtonian theory generally predicted the aerodynamics of the 5 B configuration with acceptable accuracy for all expansion <b>flap</b> <b>deflections</b> and for compression <b>flap</b> <b>deflections</b> {{less than or equal}} to 10 degrees.

The arrow wing was tested at a Mach number of 0. 02 and at an angle-of-attack range from - 4 deg to 24 deg. The results of the investigation showed that deflecting the leading edge and trailing edge in combination could promote an attached-flow condition at the wing leading edge.

50|$|The {{summary of}} the {{investigation}} said the testing results for the VZ-5 were not favorable:The investigation showed that the airplane was unstable over the speed range {{and could not be}} trimmed about the actual center of gravity at 0.64 chord for the low speed. In order to provide a reasonable degree of longitudinal stability for the basic airplane configuration and a bare capability of trim over the <b>flap</b> <b>deflection</b> range, it would be necessary to ballast the airplane to move the center of gravity far ahead of its actual location. About 700 pounds of weight added to the cockpit area would be necessary to move the center of gravity the required amount. The airplane can develop a hovering lift of about 4,000 pounds which is approximately equal to its weight. The airplane had very high effective dihedral which, coupled with the certain directional instabilities, would be expected to produce highly undesirable flying qualities.”Since the VZ-5 was only ground and wind tunnel tested, exactly how those “undesirable flying qualities” would have become manifest in test fights never became known.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} a leading edge flap on the {{aerodynamics}} of a low aspect ratio delta wing is studied analytically. The separated flow field about the wing is represented by a simple vortex model composed of a conical straight vortex sheet and a concentrated vortex. The analysis is {{carried out in the}} cross flow plane by mapping the wing trace, by means of the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation into the real axis of the transformed plane. Particular attention is given to the influence of the angle of attack and <b>flap</b> <b>deflection</b> angle on lift and drag forces. Both lift and drag decrease with <b>flap</b> <b>deflection,</b> while the lift-to-drag ratioe increases. A simple coordinate transformation is used to obtain a closed form expression for the lift-to-drag ratio as a function of <b>flap</b> <b>deflection.</b> The main effect of leading edge <b>flap</b> <b>deflection</b> is a partial suppression of the separated flow on the leeside of the wing. Qualitative comparison with experiments is presented, showing agreement in the general trends...|$|E

Test results showed that lift and drag increments in dynamic ground effect were always lower than static values.

Lift, drag, pitching-moment, and flap hinge-moment {{data were obtained}} for the wing with the various flaps deflected up to 60 °. In general, changes in angle of attack, <b>flap</b> <b>deflection,</b> or flap span and spanwise location produced trends in lift, drag, pitching moment, and flap hinge moment that were similar to but of different mag-nitudes from those for unswept wings of higher aspect ratio. The incre-ment of lift coefficient due to 30 ° of <b>flap</b> <b>deflection</b> was relatively unaffected by the spanwise location of the flaps and increased nearly linearly with flap span. Because {{of the increase in}} the drag coeffi-cients and the associated decrease in the values of the lift-drag ratio with increasing'flap deflection, an advantage may be gained by limiting the <b>flap</b> <b>deflection</b> to moderate angles (about 30 °), even though the lift coefficients increase with further increases in <b>flap</b> <b>deflection...</b>|$|E

40|$|Blowing boundary-layer {{control was}} applied to the leading- and trailing-edge flaps of a 45 deg sweptback-wing {{complete}} model in a full-scale low-speed wind-tunnel study. The principal {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the effects of leading-edge <b>flap</b> <b>deflection</b> and boundary-layer control on maximum lift and longitudinal stability. Leading-edge <b>flap</b> <b>deflection</b> alone was sufficient to maintain static longitudinal stability without trailing-edge flaps. However, leading-edge flap blowing was required to maintain longitudinal stability by delaying leading-edge flow separation when trailing-edge flaps were deflected either with or without blowing. Partial-span leading-edge flaps deflected 60 deg with moderate blowing gave the major increase in maximum lift, although higher deflection and additional blowing gave some further increase. Inboard of 0. 4 semispan leading-edge <b>flap</b> <b>deflection</b> could be reduced to 40 deg and/or blowing could be omitted with only small loss in maximum lift.

40|$|Abstract: Hydrodynamics of {{porpoising}} {{instability in}} vertical-plane motions of high-speed planing vessels {{have been investigated}} for years. However, not much work has been published on dynamic control of vertical-plane motions of planing boats by controllable appendages. In this paper, effects of controllable transom flaps on heave/pitch motion characteristics of high-speed planing vessels are investigated. A control-oriented nonlinear model is derived first for the high-speed prismatic planing craft equipped with a controllable transom flap in the calm water. Then, effects of different static <b>flap</b> <b>deflections</b> on the ship’s equilibrium running attitude and vertical-plane motion stability are analyzed. Analysis shows that porpoising cannot be avoided at high speeds by presetting static transom <b>flap</b> <b>deflections</b> through static feedforward control.

Small amounts of blowing are used on the knee of the upper surface flap and the knee of a short-chord, trailing edge control flap. The bulk of the blowing is at the trailing edge. The flap could extend the full span of the model wing or over the inboard part only, with blown ailerons outboard.
