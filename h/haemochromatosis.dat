25|$|There exist {{other causes}} of excess iron accumulation, which {{have to be}} {{considered}} before <b>haemochromatosis</b> is diagnosed.|$|E
25|$|Serum {{transferrin}} and transferrin saturation {{are commonly}} used as screening for <b>haemochromatosis.</b> Transferrin binds iron and is responsible for iron transport in the blood. Measuring transferrin provides a crude measure of iron stores in the body. Fasting transferrin saturation values in excess of 45% for males or 35% in premenopausal women (i.e. 300ng/L in males and 200ng/L in females) are recognized as a threshold for further evaluation of <b>haemochromatosis.</b> Transferrin saturation greater than 62% is suggestive of homozygosity for mutations in the HFE gene.|$|E
25|$|Heart arrhythmias: Arrhythmia or {{abnormal}} heart rhythms {{can cause}} heart palpitations, chest pain and light-headedness and are occasionally life-threatening. This condition {{can often be}} reversed with treatment for <b>haemochromatosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Based on the history, {{the doctor}} might {{consider}} specific tests to monitor organ dysfunction, {{such as an}} echocardiogram for heart failure, or blood glucose monitoring for patients with <b>haemochromatosis</b> diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Liver biopsies involve {{taking a}} sample of tissue from the liver, using a thin needle. The amount of iron in the sample is then {{quantified}} and compared to normal, and evidence of liver damage, especially cirrhosis, measured microscopically. Formerly, {{this was the only}} way to confirm a diagnosis of <b>haemochromatosis</b> but measures of transferrin and ferritin along with a history are considered adequate in determining the presence of the malady. Risks of biopsy include bruising, bleeding and infection. Now, when a history and measures of transferrin or ferritin point to <b>haemochromatosis,</b> it is debatable whether a liver biopsy is still necessary to quantify the amount of accumulated iron.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>haemochromatosis</b> is often made following the incidental finding on routine blood screening of elevated serum liver enzymes or {{elevation of the}} transferrin saturation. Arthropathy with stiff joints, diabetes, or fatigue, may be the presenting complaint.|$|E
25|$|Congestive heart failure: If excess iron in {{the heart}} interferes with the its ability to {{circulate}} enough blood, {{a number of problems}} can occur, even death. The condition may be reversible when <b>haemochromatosis</b> is treated and excess iron stores reduced.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{is stored}} in the liver, the {{pancreas}} and the heart. Long-term effects of <b>haemochromatosis</b> on these organs can be very serious, even fatal when untreated. For example, similar to alcoholism, <b>haemochromatosis</b> can cause cirrhosis of the liver. The liver is a primary storage area for iron and will naturally accumulate excess iron. Over time the liver {{is likely to be}} damaged by iron overload. Cirrhosis itself may lead to additional and more serious complications, including bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices) and stomach (gastric varices) and severe fluid retention in the abdomen (ascites). Toxins may accumulate in the blood and eventually affect mental functioning. This can lead to confusion or even coma (hepatic encephalopathy).|$|E
25|$|Studies {{indicate}} that persons with symptomatic <b>haemochromatosis</b> have somewhat reduced life expectancy {{compared to the}} general population. This is mainly due to excess mortality from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Patients who were treated with phlebotomy lived longer than those who weren't. Patients without liver disease or diabetes had similar survival rate to the general population.|$|E
25|$|As vitamin C enhances iron absorption, iron {{overload}} {{may become}} an issue to people with genetic iron overload disorders, such as <b>haemochromatosis.</b> One trial in people with sickle cell anemia reported that compared to placebo, after 180 days of supplementation with 1400 mg vitamin C and 800 IU vitamin E, {{there was a significant}} increase in haemolytic biomarkers.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{studies suggest}} the {{original}} <b>haemochromatosis</b> mutation arose {{in a single}} person, possibly of Celtic ethnicity, who lived 60–70 generations ago. At that time when dietary iron may have been scarcer than today, {{the presence of the}} mutant allele may have provided an evolutionary or natural selection reproductive advantage by maintaining higher iron levels in the blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{regulation}} of dietary iron absorption {{is complex and}} our understanding is incomplete. One of the better characterized genes responsible for hereditary <b>haemochromatosis</b> is HFE on chromosome 6, which codes for a protein that participates in the {{regulation of}} iron absorption. The HFE gene has two common mutations, C282Y and H63D. The C282Y allele is a transition point mutation from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 845 in the HFE gene, resulting in a missense mutation that replaces the cysteine residue at position 282 with a tyrosine amino acid. Heterozygotes for either allele do not manifest clinical iron overload but may display an increased iron uptake.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{regulation}} of iron metabolism is still poorly understood, a clear model of how <b>haemochromatosis</b> operates is still not available. A working model describes the defect in the HFE gene, where a mutation puts the intestinal absorption of iron into overdrive. Normally, HFE facilitates the binding of transferrin, which is iron's carrier protein in the blood. Transferrin levels are typically elevated at times of iron depletion (low ferritin stimulates the release of transferrin from the liver). When transferrin is high, HFE works to increase the intestinal release of iron into the blood. When HFE is mutated, the intestines perpetually interpret a strong transferrin signal as if the body were deficient in iron. This leads to maximal iron absorption from ingested foods and iron overload in the tissues. However, HFE {{is only part of}} the story, since many patients with mutated HFE do not manifest clinical iron overload, and some patients with iron overload have a normal HFE genotype. A possible explanation is the fact that HFE normally plays a role in the production of hepcidin in the liver, a function that is impaired in HFE mutations.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Haemochromatosis</b> (or hemochromatosis) type 1 (also HFE {{hereditary}} <b>haemochromatosis</b> or HFE-related hereditary <b>haemochromatosis)</b> is a {{hereditary disease}} characterized by excessive intestinal absorption of dietary iron {{resulting in a}} pathological increase in total body iron stores. Humans, like most animals, have no means to excrete excess iron.|$|E

2500|$|Standard {{diagnostic}} measures for <b>haemochromatosis,</b> transferrin saturation and ferritin tests, {{are not a}} part of routine medical testing. [...] Screening for <b>haemochromatosis</b> is recommended if the patient has a parent, child or sibling with the disease.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Haemochromatosis</b> is [...] in its manifestations, i.e., often {{presenting}} {{with signs}} or symptoms suggestive of other diagnoses that affect specific organ systems. Many {{of the signs}} and symptoms below are uncommon and most patients with the hereditary form of <b>haemochromatosis</b> do not show any overt signs of disease nor do they suffer premature morbidity.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is often}} used to imply an {{association}} with the HFE gene. For many years, HFE was the only known gene associated with <b>haemochromatosis,</b> and the term [...] "hereditary haemochromatosis" [...] was used to describe <b>haemochromatosis</b> type 1. However, it is now known that there are many different genetic associations with this condition. The older the text, or the more general the audience, the more likely that HFE is implied.|$|E
2500|$|Routine {{screening}} {{of the general population}} for hereditary <b>haemochromatosis</b> is generally not done. Mass genetic screening has been evaluated by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), among other groups. [...] The USPSTF recommended against genetic {{screening of}} the general population for hereditary <b>haemochromatosis</b> because the likelihood of discovering an undiagnosed patient with clinically relevant iron overload is less than 1 in 1,000. [...] Although there is strong evidence that treatment of iron overload can save lives in patients with transfusional iron overload, no clinical study has shown that for asymptomatic carriers of hereditary <b>haemochromatosis</b> treatment with venesection [...] (phlebotomy) provides any clinical benefit. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} patients be screened for iron overload using serum ferritin as a marker: If serum ferritin exceeds 1000ng/mL, iron overload is very likely the cause.|$|E

2500|$|Males {{are usually}} {{diagnosed}} after their forties and fifties, and women several decades later, owing to regular iron loss through menstruation (which ceases in menopause). The severity of clinical {{disease in the}} hereditary form varies considerably. [...] There is evidence suggesting that hereditary <b>haemochromatosis</b> patients affected with other liver ailments such as hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease suffer worse liver disease than those with either condition alone. [...] There are also juvenile forms of hereditary <b>haemochromatosis</b> that present in childhood with the same consequences of iron overload.|$|E
2500|$|Clinically {{the disease}} may be silent, but {{characteristic}} radiological features may {{point to the}} diagnosis. [...] The increased iron stores in the organs involved, especially in the liver and pancreas, result in characteristic findings on unenhanced CT and a decreased signal intensity in MRI scans. <b>Haemochromatosis</b> arthropathy includes degenerative osteoarthritis and chondrocalcinosis. The distribution of the arthropathy is distinctive, but not unique, frequently affecting {{the second and third}} metacarpophalangeal joints of the hand. [...] The arthropathy can therefore be an early clue as to the diagnosis of <b>haemochromatosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Haemochromatosis</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{heritable}} genetic conditions in people of northern European extraction with a prevalence of 1 in 200. The disease has a variable penetration and about 1 in 10 people of this demographic carry a mutation in one of the genes regulating iron metabolism, the most common allele being the C282Y allele in the HFE gene. [...] The prevalence of mutations in iron metabolism genes varies in different populations. [...] A study of 3,011 unrelated white Australians found that 14% were heterozygous carriers of an HFE mutation, 0.5% were homozygous for an HFE mutation, and only 0.25% of the study population had clinically relevant iron overload. [...] Most patients who are homozygous for HFE mutations will not manifest clinically relevant <b>haemochromatosis</b> (see Genetics above). Other populations have a lower prevalence of both the genetic mutation and the clinical disease.|$|E
2500|$|Serum Ferritin: Ferritin, {{a protein}} {{synthesized}} by the liver {{is the primary}} form of iron storage within cells and tissues. [...] Measuring ferritin provides another crude estimate of whole body iron stores though many conditions, particularly inflammation (but also chronic alcohol consumption, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and others), can elevate serum ferritin - which can account for up to 90% of cases where elevated levels are observed. Normal values for males are 12–300ng/ml (nanograms per millilitre) and for female, 12–150ng/ml. Serum ferritin in excess of 1000 nanograms per millilitre of blood is almost always attributable to <b>haemochromatosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|People with {{abnormal}} iron regulatory genes do {{not reduce}} their absorption of iron {{in response to}} increased iron levels in the body. [...] Thus the iron stores of the body increase. [...] As they increase, the iron which is initially stored as ferritin is deposited in organs as haemosiderin and this is toxic to tissue, probably at least partially by inducing oxidative stress. [...] Iron is a pro-oxidant. [...] Thus, <b>haemochromatosis</b> shares common symptomology (e.g., cirrhosis and dyskinetic symptoms) with other [...] "pro-oxidant" [...] diseases such as Wilson's disease, chronic manganese poisoning, and hyperuricaemic syndrome in Dalmatian dogs. [...] The latter also experience [...] "bronzing".|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the term}} <b>haemochromatosis</b> (spelled {{hemochromatosis}} in American English) was initially {{used to refer}} to what is now more specifically called <b>haemochromatosis</b> type 1 (or HFE-related hereditary <b>haemochromatosis).</b> Currently, <b>haemochromatosis</b> (without further specification) is mostly defined as iron overload with a hereditary or primary cause, or originating from a metabolic disorder. However, the term is currently also used more broadly to refer to any form of iron overload, thus requiring specification of the cause, for example, hereditary <b>haemochromatosis.</b> Hereditary <b>haemochromatosis</b> is an autosomal recessive disorder with estimated prevalence in the population of 1 in 200 among patients with European ancestry, with lower incidence in other ethnic groups. The gene responsible for hereditary <b>haemochromatosis</b> (known as HFE gene) is located on chromosome 6; the majority of hereditary <b>haemochromatosis</b> patients have mutations in this HFE gene.|$|E

5000|$|The {{standard}} of practice in diagnosis of <b>haemochromatosis</b> was recently reviewed by Pietrangelo. Positive HFE analysis confirms the clinical diagnosis of <b>haemochromatosis</b> in asymptomatic individuals with blood tests showing increased iron stores, or for predictive testing {{of individuals with}} {{a family history of}} <b>haemochromatosis.</b> The alleles evaluated by HFE gene analysis are evident in ~80% of patients with haemochromatosis; a negative report for HFE gene does not rule out <b>haemochromatosis.</b> In a patient with negative HFE gene testing, elevated iron status for no other obvious reason, and family history of liver disease, additional evaluation of liver iron concentration is indicated. In this case, diagnosis of <b>haemochromatosis</b> is based on biochemical analysis and histologic examination of a liver biopsy. Assessment of the hepatic iron index (HII) is considered the [...] "gold standard" [...] for diagnosis of <b>haemochromatosis.</b>|$|E
