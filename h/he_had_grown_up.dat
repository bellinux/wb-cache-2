5|$|Arnold {{was not in}} a {{position}} to influence what transpired at Fort Griswold, as he remained in New London and observed the action at Fort Griswold across the river. He was blamed by many on both sides for the affair, however, because he was the commanding officer who bore full responsibility for the actions of his men. American sentiments were further inflamed against him for the simple fact that he had betrayed and killed those among whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

A Western New York native, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> a Canisius basketball fan because his uncle, Joe Niland, had been a former player and coach there.

5|$|Kirkland cites his {{assistant}} director Matthew Nastuk {{as a big}} influence on the episode. He became heavily involved with the animation because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> in New Jersey, where the Thomas Edison National Historical Park that Homer and Bart visit is located. To help make the museum look as authentic as possible, Kirkland and Nastuk visited it and took {{a large number of}} photographs that they brought back to the animation studio. At one point in the episode, Homer writes complex math formulas on a chalkboard. The producers wanted them to be actual formulas, so writer David X. Cohen got in contact with a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who were able to provide them.|$|E

He would start haunting late at night, and in order to stop this, poles were struck through his body, whereafter the haunting stopped. As far as the farmer could remember they mentioned Store Mosse, a bog about 10 miles from the find, close to Nackhälle village, though he acknowledged that his memory might fail him as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> in the vicinity of that bog.|$|E

25|$|Creative {{freedom that}} the staff had enjoyed seemed to diminish. By the 1980s and 1990s, the {{magazine}} had become more profitable than ever, but many also believed it had become more predictable. Mark Mulvoy was the first top editor whose background contained nothing but sports; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> {{as one of the}} magazine's readers, but he had no interest in fiction, movies, hobbies or history. Mulvoy's top writer Rick Reilly had also been raised on SI and followed in the footsteps of many of the great writers that he grew up admiring, but many felt that the magazine as a whole came to reflect Mulvoy's complete lack of sophistication. Mulvoy also hired the current creative director Christopher Hercik. Critics said that it rarely broke (or even featured) stories on the major controversies in sports (drugs, violence, commercialism) any more, and that it focused on major sports and celebrities to the exclusion of other topics.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, the National Football League {{had grown}} to rival Major League Baseball {{as one of the}} most popular {{professional}} sports leagues in the United States. One franchise that did not share in this newfound success of the league was the Chicago Cardinals, owned by the Bidwill family, who had become overshadowed by the more popular Chicago Bears. The Bidwills hoped to relocate their franchise, preferably to St. Louis but could not come to terms with the league on a relocation fee. Needing cash, the Bidwills began entertaining offers from would-be investors, and one of the men who approached the Bidwills was Lamar Hunt, son and heir of millionaire oilman H. L. Hunt. Hunt offered to buy the Cardinals and move them to Dallas, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up.</b> However, these negotiations came to nothing, since the Bidwills insisted on retaining a controlling interest in the franchise and were unwilling to move their team to a city where a previous NFL franchise had failed in 1952. While Hunt negotiated with the Bidwills, similar offers were made by Bud Adams, Bob Howsam, and Max Winter.|$|E

Beilhart also started two newspapers called Spirit Fruit and Spirit Voice that were distributed widely by subscription. The Spirit Fruit Society was incorporated as a religious organization in 1901.

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the recruiting process, Warren was considered very likely to play for the USC Trojans football team, since they had four players from his high school on the roster and his godfather, Mark Carrier, was a USC alumn. [...] However, USC had a lot of depth at cornerback at the time and Warren (as well as his father) had a good relationship with Michigan assistant coach Ron English. [...] When Warren made Michigan his final decision, he was noted as feeling that his heart wanted him to choose USC, which was the school <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> rooting for, but his head led him to Michigan where he could play immediately and work under the tutelage of English, who had developed many defensive backs who went on to the National Football League.|$|E

In that year, aged eighteen, Fuller received a commission from Ann Fraser Bon, philanthropist and supporter of Victoria's Aboriginal people. The commission was for Barak–last chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aborigines, a formal oil on canvas portrait of the Indigenous Australian leader, William Barak. Ultimately, that painting was acquired by the State Library of Victoria. Although the painting is an important work regularly used to illustrate this significant figure in Australia's history, interpretations of Fuller's portrait are mixed: ...|$|E

Kirkland returned to direct the episode, feeling better after getting over the divorce. Despite the circumstances, Kirkland stated that he [...] "loved" [...] working on the episode, and could relate to the story since <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> in a [...] "sort of hippie commune school" [...] in the late '60s and early '70s.

500|$|Khaled Hosseini {{worked as}} a medical internist at Kaiser Hospital in Mountain View, California for several years before {{publishing}} The Kite Runner. [...] In 1999, Hosseini learned through a news report that the Taliban had banned kite flying in Afghanistan, a restriction he found particularly cruel. The news [...] "struck a personal chord" [...] for him, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> with the sport while living in Afghanistan. He was motivated to write a 25-page short story about two boys who fly kites in Kabul. Hosseini submitted copies to Esquire and The New Yorker, both of which rejected it.

According to Hosseini, the narrative became [...] "much darker" [...] than he originally intended. His editor, Cindy Spiegel, [...] "helped him rework the last third of his manuscript", something she describes as relatively common for a first novel.|$|E
500|$|One of Tarn and Zach Adams' {{early works}} was a text based {{adventure}} game called dragslay, {{written in the}} BASIC language and influenced by Dungeons and Dragons.

Adams explained his interest in fantasy games, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> [...] "surrounded by that sort of thing...along with generic sci-fi, generic fantasy {{is part of our}} heritage." [...] Years later, before entering graduate school in mathematics, Adams began working on a project he called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood. It was named after a deity in dragslay, originally named for a variable [...] "arm_ok"—which counted the limbs the player still had attached. This new project was a two-dimensional (would later have 3D graphics) isometric fantasy role-playing game in which the player encountered and fought goblins.|$|E
500|$|In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau hailed Off the Wall as [...] "the dance groove of the year" [...] {{and that}} Jackson's vocal stylings were a {{reminder}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up.</b> In a review for Melody Maker Phil McNeill expressed the opinion that in Off the Wall Jackson sounded comfortable, confident and in control. He believed [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" [...] had a [...] "classy" [...] introduction {{and that it was}} the best song on the album. He also praised [...] "Rock with You", describing it as [...] "masterful". The reviewer concurred with a colleague that Jackson was [...] "probably the best singer in the world right now in terms of style and technique". Giving the album a favorable review in Smash Hits, David Hepworth said that Jackson [...] "sings like an angel". Sounds shared the same point of view, qualifying Jackson's voice as [...] "astoninshingly agile". The first side of Off the Wall is praised for its [...] "clutch of dancers that must have even Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards watching their backs".|$|E
