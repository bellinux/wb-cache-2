5|$|Nevertheless, as of 2008, Japan {{still was}} Germany's second largest trading partner in Asia after China. In 2006, German <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> Japan totaled €15.6billion and German exports to Japan €14.2billion (15.4% and 9% {{more than the}} {{previous}} year, respectively). In 2008, however, Japanese exports and imports {{to and from the}} European Union fell by 7.8 and 4.8% after growing by 5.8% in 2007 due to the global financial crisis. Bilateral trade between Germany and Japan also shrank in 2008, with <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> Japan having dropped by 6.6% and German exports to Japan having declined by 5.5%. Despite Japan having remained Germany's principal trading partner in Asia after China in 2008, measured in terms of total German foreign trade, Japan’s share of both exports and imports is relatively low and falls well short of the potential between the world’s third- and fifth-largest economies.|$|E
5|$|Although men {{and money}} had been secured, the markets {{component}} of the Bruce plan was never fully realised. At the 1923 Imperial Economic Conference, Bruce lobbied consistently for the Conservative government of Stanley Baldwin to make changes to Great Britain's trading arrangements to give preference to dominion products over <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> other nations. He argued for Empire-wide economic trading arrangements that filled domestic demands by production from member states before seeking supplemental <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> other countries and empires. Baldwin and the Conservatives attempted to introduce such a scheme in Britain; however, the British public feared higher prices for basic products (particularly food), and this fear {{was a factor in}} the Conservative government's defeat in the election of December 1923. Baldwin's successor Ramsay MacDonald repudiated the plan, much to Bruce's chagrin, and attempts to revive negotiations foundered as economic conditions worsened throughout the decade. World agricultural prices stalled in the mid-1920s as European and American agricultural production recovered to pre-war levels, and Australian exports were crowded out of markets as the decade progressed.|$|E

5|$|American {{automakers}} {{had first}} countered imports {{such as the}} Volkswagen Beetle with compact cars including the Ford Falcon, Chevrolet Corvair and Plymouth Valiant, although these cars featured six-cylinder engines and comprised a larger vehicle class. As the popularity of smaller Japanese <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> Toyota and Datsun increased throughout the 1960s, Ford North America responded by introducing the Ford Cortina from its European arm Ford of Europe as a captive import. American automakers would soon introduce their own subcompacts.|$|E
5|$|Canada has a {{well-developed}} media sector, but {{its cultural}} output; particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines, is often overshadowed by <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> the United States.

5|$|Mining and {{metallurgy}} developed further {{during the}} 16th century, and technical progress {{took place in}} various commercial applications. Great quantities of exported agricultural and forest products floated down the rivers to be transported through ports and land routes.

30|$|Hydroquinone {{levels in}} the skin-lightening {{products}} ranged from below detection to 0.83  ±  0.51  % in creams <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> Cote d’Voire, 0.02  ±  0.01 to 0.51  ±  0.18  % in creams <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> Italy, below detection to 0.32  ±  0.16  % in creams <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> India. Creams originating from USA, Indonesia, Germany, Senegal, Ghana and China recorded hydroquinone levels below the detection limit. The highest concentration of hydroquinone was recorded in ZC (1.61  ±  0.72  %) <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> UK followed by CD (0.83  ±  0.51  %) <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> Cote d’Voire, Skin Solution Cream (0.51  ±  0.18  %) <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> Italy, DSC (0.40  ±  0.71  %) <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> Nigeria and CLC (0.32  ±  0.16  %) <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> India. Hydroquinone {{levels in the}} skin-lightening soaps ranged from below detection to 0.05  ±  0.03  %. Classic white soap and CTS recorded hydroquinone concentration of 0.05  ±  0.03 and 0.02  ±  0.01  %, respectively. Overall, 64  % of the creams and 75  % of soaps analysed recorded hydroquinone concentrations below detection. All the skin-lightening creams and soaps analysed recorded hydroquinone concentration below the US FDA threshold limit of 2  % (USFDA 2009). Doreen (2010) recorded levels of hydroquinone (0.001 – 3.45  %) in some skin lighteners in Ghana, which was higher than the present study. However, levels of hydroquinone (0.0002 – 0.0350  %) in body creams and lotions by Terer et al. (2013), Kenya are comparable with the present study.|$|R

5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London shortly after taking office in 1957. He generated headlines by proposing that 15% of Canadian spending on US imports instead be spent on <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> the United Kingdom. Britain responded with an offer of a free trade agreement, which was rejected by the Canadians. As the Harold Macmillan government in the UK sought to enter the Common Market, Diefenbaker feared that Canadian exports to the UK would be threatened. He also believed that the mother country should place the Commonwealth first, and sought to discourage Britain's entry. The British were annoyed at Canadian interference. Britain's initial attempt to enter the Common Market was vetoed by French President Charles de Gaulle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s blues music was largely known in Britain through blues-influenced boogie-woogie, and the jump blues of Fats Waller and Louis Jordan. Imported {{recordings}} of American artists were brought over by African American servicemen stationed in Britain {{during and after}} World War II, merchant seamen visiting the ports of London, Liverpool, Newcastle on Tyne and Belfast, and in a trickle of (illegal) <b>imports.</b> <b>From</b> 1955 major British record labels HMV and EMI (the latter, particularly through their subsidiary Decca Records), began to distribute American jazz and increasingly blues records to the emerging market.|$|E

5|$|Outside North America and Western Europe, the Labrador arrived later. For example, the Russian Retriever Club {{traces the}} arrival of Labradors to the late 1960s, as {{household}} pets of diplomats {{and others in the}} foreign ministry. The establishment of the breed in the Commonwealth of Independent States (former USSR) was initially hindered by the relatively small numbers of Labradors and great distances involved, leading to difficulty establishing breedings and bloodlines; {{at the start of the}} 1980s, home-born dogs were still regularly supplemented by further <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> overseas. Difficulties such as these initially led to Labradors being tacitly cross-bred to other types of retriever. In the 1990s, improved access to overseas shows and bloodlines is said to have helped this situation become regularised.|$|E
5|$|Ouw Peh Tjoa was {{directed}} and produced by The Teng Chun for his company, Cino Motion Pictures. Since releasing Sam Pek Eng Tay in 1931, {{based on the}} legend of the Butterfly Lovers, The Teng Chun had released a series of films based on Chinese legends and folktales, including Pat Bie To (Eight Beautiful Women; 1932) and Pat Kiam Hiap (Eight Swordsmen; 1933). These stories were selected because the peranakan Chinese in the Indies were unable to understand Mandarin and Cantonese <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> China, but wanted to see films based on Chinese mythology. Overall, The Teng Chun's films emphasised the martial art silat and were generally profitable, allowing him to dominate the industry.|$|E
5|$|Sereno E. Payne, {{chairman}} of the House Ways and Means Committee, had held hearings in late 1908, and sponsored the resulting draft legislation. On balance, the bill reduced tariffs slightly, but when it passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate, the {{chairman of}} the Senate Finance Committee, Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, attached many amendments raising rates. This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette, who urged Taft to say that the bill was not in accord with the party platform. Taft refused, angering them. Taft insisted that most <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> the Philippines be free of duty, and according to Anderson, showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on and cared about.|$|E
