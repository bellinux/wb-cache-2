40|$|In 1957, 1567 {{acres of}} <b>hybrid</b> seed <b>corn</b> were {{approved}} for certification. This was the smallest annual number of acres reported {{during the period}} 1948 through 1957. Two of the factors responsible for this decline were:(1) intensive price competition between certified grower-sellers had resulted in low prices and elimination of many certified growers, and (2) most of the certified grower-sellers had very small seed volumes and could not finance adequate advertising and sales promotion programs. The marketing problems of certified growers were discussed during {{the annual meeting of}} Nebraska Certified <b>Hybrid</b> Seed <b>Corn</b> Producers Association in March 1958 and in June 1958 the Nebraska Hybrid Seed Growers Association was formed and incorporated as a marketing cooperative of certified growers. The objectives of this study are: To describe the marketing system of <b>hybrid</b> seed <b>corn</b> in Nebraska, including the channels of distribution for certified <b>hybrid</b> seed <b>corn</b> and commercial <b>hybrid</b> seed <b>corn,</b> and the importance of the various distributors. To describe the <b>hybrid</b> seed <b>corn</b> market in Nebraska with respect to: its structure, supply and demand, production, processing, and marketing cots, average seed prices, and marketing margins. To evaluate the success of the Nebraska Hybrid Seed Growers Association in resolving the marketing problem of certified <b>hybrid</b> seed <b>corn</b> growers. Certified growers have been doing an excellent job of producing and processing <b>hybrid</b> seed <b>corn.</b> Although the quality of the certified growers’ processing operations is high, costs could be reduced by hiring custom operators to perform these operations. In addition, marketing operations of some of the certified grower-sellers have not been too effective. From the limited marketing information obtained in the survey of certified growers, there were indications that small volume (200 to 1000 bushels) certified grower-sellers still have marketing problems which were prevalent in 1957. Larger volume certified grower-sellers apparently have solved some of their marketing problems, and have been more effective than small volume certified grower-sellers in marketing their seed. The Nebraska Hybrid Seed Growers Association, established in 1958 to market <b>hybrid</b> seed <b>corn</b> for its certified grower-members, has encountered and apparently solved some of the marketing problems. However, other marketing problems remain for future solution. Since the Association has been in operation only two years, its success in resolving the marketing problems of certified grower-members cannot be substantiated at this time. Advisor: C. J.

25|$|Wallace {{attended}} Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, {{graduating in}} 1910 with a bachelor's degree in animal husbandry. During {{his time at}} Iowa State, Wallace {{was a member of}} the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. He worked on the editorial staff of the family-owned paper Wallaces' Farmer in Des Moines from 1910 to 1924, and took the role of chief editor from 1924 to 1929. Wallace experimented with breeding high-yielding <b>hybrid</b> <b>corn,</b> and wrote a number of publications on agriculture. In 1915, he devised the first corn-hog ratio charts indicating the probable course of markets. Wallace was also a practicing statistician, writing an influential article with pioneering statistician George W. Snedecor of Iowa State University on computational methods for correlations and regressions and publishing sophisticated statistical studies in the pages of Wallaces’ Farmer. Snedecor invited Wallace to teach a graduate course on least squares. It was Wallace, more than any other individual, who introduced econometrics (a form of statistical analysis used by economists) to the field of agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{agriculture}} {{also produces}} undesirable environmental effects. Large scale growing operations of commodity crops {{rely on the}} use of chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. Modified corn is a greedy plant that consumes more fertilizer that any other crop. Without either of these, the soil alone could not have supported the large number of <b>hybrid</b> <b>corn</b> plants that helped America’s food industry explode. The production of both synthetic pesticides and fertilizers requires the use of natural gas and petroleum. Currently, it is relatively inexpensive to produce fertilizers and pesticides in this fashion, since the product is efficient and can be produced in huge quantities. Petrochemical fertilizers are preferred over sustainable options (manure) for these reasons. Fossil fuels are also crucial for transportation of product, manufacturing, and for running tractors and harvesting equipment. It is estimated that every bushel of corn requires the equivalent of between one quarter and one third of a U.S. gallon of petroleum to grow (37 to 50 liters per metric ton). For every acre of corn, about 50 U.S. gallons of petroleum are needed (470 L/ha). The use of fossil fuel in farming is standard; without this relatively affordable and convenient fuel source aiding in the fertilization, pest resistance, harvesting and manufacturing corn crops would not meet a high enough yield to satisfy the needs of the farmer or the demands of the consumer.|$|E

Malcolm Trout invented the process for the homogenization of milk in the 1930s. In the 1960s, MSU scientists developed cisplatin, a leading cancer fighting drug. Today Michigan State continues its research with facilities such as the U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory and a particle accelerator called the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. In 2004, scientists at the Cyclotron produced and observed a new isotope of the element germanium, called Ge-60. In that same year, Michigan State, in consortium with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the government of Brazil, broke ground on the 4.1-meter Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR) in the Andes Mountains of Chile. The consortium telescope will allow the Physics & Astronomy department to study galaxy formation and origins. Since 1999, MSU has been part of another consortium called the Michigan Life Sciences Corridor, which aims to develop biotechnology research in the State of Michigan. The College of Communication Arts and Sciences' Quello Center researches current issues of information and communication management.

2500|$|<b>Hybrid</b> <b>corn</b> was detassled {{manually}} {{until the}} mid-1950s when a cytoplasm {{was discovered that}} would cause one of the inbred lines to be male sterile while the hybridized seed corn it produced would regain male fertility.

40|$|Three <b>corn</b> <b>hybrids</b> {{harvested}} as whole-plant silage {{were evaluated}} in three separate feeding trials with lactating dairy cows.

Milk yield was lower, but milk fat percentage and yield were higher, for the high-forage diet containing brown-midrib corn silage. In trial 3, 24 multiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square with 28 -d periods. Treatments were corn silage at two concentrations of neutral detergent fiber (Garst 8751, 39. 2 % NDF; Cargill 3677, 32. 8 % NDF) each fed in normal- (53 % of dry matter) and high- (61 to 67 % of dry matter) forage diets.
