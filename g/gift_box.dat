Heath paid children to pick wild berries, and [...] "when the fishing season was slim" [...] she also paid fishermen and other locals to harvest the berries. Her business developed so quickly that in 1947 she sold 300 <b>gift</b> <b>boxes,</b> and by 1957 the business exported over 4000 <b>gift</b> <b>boxes.</b> Husband Ken abandoned his plans to start a [...] "cabin court" [...] business (a cluster of cottages for short-term rental) and instead purchased a Super Cub airplane to be able to harvest choice remote berry patches. They shipped <b>gift</b> <b>boxes</b> in large containers on steam ships to a forwarding station in Seattle, where packages were addressed and sent out by rail.

25|$|In the post-SummerSlam wedding reception, Roberts {{and his new}} ally, The Undertaker, {{made their}} {{presence}} known by hiding a live snake {{in one of the}} newly married couple's wedding presents; Elizabeth was frightened when she opened the <b>gift</b> <b>box,</b> and the Undertaker blindsided Savage by knocking him out with the urn. Sid Justice ran off both Roberts and The Undertaker. Savage, still unable to compete due to his WrestleMania VII loss to the Ultimate Warrior, immediately began a public campaign to have himself reinstated as an active wrestler to gain revenge on Roberts; however, WWF President Jack Tunney refused. Meanwhile, Roberts cut a series of promos berating Savage. The feud began to boil over during a television taping for WWF Superstars of Wrestling October 21 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, when Roberts cut an in-ring promo to goad Savage – who was providing TV commentary – into the ring. After he was lured into the ring, Roberts attacked Savage, eventually tying Savage into the ropes before getting a live king cobra to bite his arm, according to Hulk Hogan and Jake Roberts on the Pick Your Poison DVD that the snake was holding on with the fangs and that Jake had a hard time getting the snake off Randy. Sid Justice was originally supposed to be the victim of the snake bite, but due to a biceps injury, Savage accepted to be snake bitten.|$|E

2500|$|The luxury {{version of}} the Compact was {{presented}} in a <b>gift</b> <b>box,</b> it was priced at a guinea and became a contemporary collector's item, tending to be little-used due to impracticality.

[...] On this luxury version the tape-measure assembly caused the centre of the gadget to rotate independently, making it difficult for adult fingers to grip the remaining part of the stable outer skin to turn the main assemblage for use as a row counter.

2500|$|While Condit was {{not named}} as an {{official}} suspect in the disappearance, Levy's family suspected that Condit was withholding important information about her disappearance. Public interest was high, and Condit's reputation suffered from the contrast between his [...] "pro-family" [...] politics, adultery with a woman younger than his daughter, and his attempts to mislead the police regarding his relationship with her. In July, two months after Levy vanished, Condit agreed to let investigators search his apartment and, hours before the search, police said he was spotted throwing out a <b>gift</b> <b>box</b> he had received from another woman into a dumpster in one of Washington's Virginia suburbs. This followed news reports that Condit had {{had an affair with}} a flight attendant. [...] Because of the Levy scandal, Condit was portrayed on an episode of South Park, where he was considered responsible for the disappearance of Chandra Levy.|$|E
2500|$|Except for the 30th Anniversary Special, {{which was}} taped at Harrah's Rio in Las Vegas, Nevada, The Price Is Right has been taped in Studio 33 in CBS Television City in Hollywood, California for its entire run. The studio, {{which is also}} used for other {{television}} productions, was renamed the Bob Barker Studio in the host's honor on the ceremonial 5,000th episode taped in March 1998. When Carey became host, {{there was talk of}} the show traveling in the future. The program is usually produced in about an hour, although if there is a guest involved, some tapings will last longer because of question and answer sessions by the audience and the guest, which the host usually moderates. Two episodes are usually taped each day, normally with three taping days per week (Monday through Wednesday, with one episode taped at 12:00pm and another at 4:00pm). The program is taped in advance of its airdate. For example, the show broadcast on February 28, 2008 was taped on January 16. As with many other shows that start production in the summer, the lead time varies during the season, as many as fifteen weeks to as little as one day. The audience is entertained by the announcer before taping begins and in case of guests, the guest will answer questions from the audience. After the taping session, there is a drawing for a door prize. On some episodes, all members of the audience receive a prize from a sponsor or celebrity guest; those prizes are usually mentioned in the Showcase (such as a complimentary slice of Papa John's Pizza, an NHL Winter Classic game puck, a couples' <b>gift</b> <b>box</b> from Hershey's or a book authored by a guest). Television and Internet viewers have also been directed to the show's official website to enter a drawing for a similar prize offered to all viewers or another prize related to the special offer (such as the Rock of Ages signed CD). Some episodes are taped [...] "out-of-order" [...] so that a specific episode will air after other episodes have aired. Notably, the Christmas Week episodes are usually taped in early December outside of the regular rotation. An episode may be taped out-of-order if a prize package reflects a trip to an event that is taking place close to the date that episode will air (primarily with CBS properties such as the Academy of Country Music Awards, NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, and various NFL on CBS games, most notably CBS Super Bowl years since Carey took over, but other games are offered). Other episodes may be aired out-of-order because of game-related incidents or situations beyond the network's control. Most episodes which have aired out of order have occurred when the show is taped far in advance, but in the time between the show taping and its airdate, a natural disaster took place at the trip venue. This happened in June 2005 with episodes that featured trips to New Orleans (which was later struck by Hurricane Katrina), with airdates moved to May and June 2006 and again in April 2010 with episodes that featured trips to Nashville, Tennessee (due to the May 2010 Tennessee floods), with airdates moved to September 2010.|$|E
