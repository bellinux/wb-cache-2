Due to his tremendous strength, he is initially feared by the protagonists. Beerus notably acts a similar manner when {{in the presence of the}} Omni-King. After Freeza's defeat, Whis speculates Goku and Vegeta may be able to defeat Beerus with their combined power. Similarly to other Gods of Destructions and Kaiō-shins, Beerus is life linked to the East Kaiō-shin, where if one dies then so will the other. This amounts to a weakness given East Kaiō-shin's vast inferiority in strength to Beerus. Due to the East Kaiō-shin being killed in the alternate timeline, while assisting Trunks in facing Dabura, the version of Beerus that exists there dies during his sleep.|$|E

The Romulans race ahead to try and communicate with Tin Man. [...] When Elbrun gleans from the Romulans telepathically that they intend to destroy Tin Man if they can't claim it, he sends it a telepathic warning to Tin Man. Tin Man suddenly comes to life and emits an <b>energy</b> <b>wave</b> that destroys the Warbird and further damages the Enterprise. Elbrun, now in communication with Tin Man, reveals that it calls itself Gomtuu. The creature is millennia-old and formerly had a crew, but they were lost in a radiation accident. Due to a combination of remorse, loneliness, and a lack of purpose, Gomtuu wishes to die in the supernova. Elbrun requests to be beamed aboard the creature, but Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) is cautious of this action. When a second warbird arrives, Picard lets Elbrun transport to Gomtuu along with Data to help procure the ship. Elbrun is initially overwhelmed by Gomtuu, but eventually comes to identify himself with the ship.|$|E

2500|$|A younger {{version of}} Jean, {{alongside}} teenage versions of Scott and Ororo, appears in [...] Now blue-eyed with long, loosely curled orange hair, this new variation of Jean had been located and enrolled sometime {{prior to the}} movie, as she, now in her mid-teens, is introduced as already being a student at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. When Alex Summers brings his younger brother to the school after his own optic laser blasts powers had manifested, Scott bumped into Jean, as he couldn't see due to being blindfolded. [...] Jean drops the many books, binders, and papers she held, but instantly we watch as this new incarnation of Jean telekinetically pulls them back into her hands, exhibiting seemingly little effort, which seems {{to imply that the}} Professor has left her mind unbarred. She gets mad at this, but apologizes as Scott explains he can't exactly look where he's going. Later, Jean is studying by a tree when Scott attempts to talk to her. Seeing the other students show fear, Jean explains that they're afraid of her because they are aware of her full powers, and therefore is treated as an outcast. Jean is affected by the <b>energy</b> <b>wave</b> released by an ancient, god-like mutant who had awakened that day. This causes Jean to have a nightmare of the world ending during which the entire school shakes, most of the students are awoken from sleep, and the Professor hurries to her room to find [...] that her telekinetic powers, already immensely strong, are quite literally burning the walls of her room. Telepathically reaching into Jean's mind to awaken her - an act that causes Charles a sizeable amount of pain - the wooden walls cease to burn and to emit smoke, and the Professor slumps back, substantially exhausted now. The powerful young psychic is reassured by Xavier that she is not losing control of her powers, despite her doubts. When the mansion is destroyed, she comforts Scott over the loss of his own brother and conceals herself, Scott, and Nightcrawler from Stryker's men. While in Stryker's base, she connects with Weapon X (Wolverine), and releases him from his cell. Before he, fearfully, leaves the complex Jean restores the few remaining memories of his that she can. She then joins the fight in Cairo. She telekinetically protects the group from Angel's metal wings. After Xavier is saved, he mentally links with her and reveals to Apocalypse that he is not the most powerful psychic, and convinces Jean to unleash the full extent of her powers. Her eyes glowing with an orangey-golden light, the powerful young Mutant's walks through midair and within a matter of seconds, a massive burst of telekinetic energy explodes outward from within Jean's body, almost instantaneously taking the shape of a great, fiery bird. With a single powerful scream that is as much verbal as it is mental, Jean Grey incinerates Apocalypse and helps to psychically restore and revive Professor Xavier. She is last seen helping to re-build the mansion, alongside Erik Lensherr, before joining Cyclops, Storm, Nightcrawler, Quicksilver, under the leadership of Hank and Raven, to become the new official team of X-Men and preparing to test her powers in her very first Danger Room session against a group of Mark I Sentinels.|$|E
