5|$|After {{finding the}} fifth and final Scroll, the Sky Scroll, Musashi discovers Thirstquencher's base, a {{floating}} ship known as the Soda Fountain. Musashi attacks the base and defeats the Sky Guardian. Thirstquencher's leader, Flatski, forces Musashi to give him Lumina {{in exchange for the}} Princess, and frees the Sky Crest. However, this unleashes the Wizard of Darkness, who was sealed within Brave <b>Fencer</b> Musashi's sword Lumina the entire time. It is also revealed by Jon that the original Brave <b>Fencer</b> Musashi sealed The Dark Wizard within the sword. Furthermore, it was Brave <b>Fencer</b> Musashi who entrusted the crests to the crest guardians to prevent The Dark Wizard's seal within Lumina from being broken. In effect, the present Musashi's quest merely aided The Dark Wizard's revival. Musashi recovers Lumina and uses it to defeat The Dark Wizard. After returning the Princess to Allucaneet Kingdom, Musashi takes Lumina to the place where he found it.|$|E

Musashi is given the blade Fusion, and is charged {{with the task of}} obtaining Brave <b>Fencer</b> Musashi's sword — Lumina, the Sword of Luminescence — before the Thirstquencher Army does.

5|$|Executive {{producer}} Hironobu Sakaguchi {{stated that}} {{the idea for the}} game first came up in February 1997. The original idea for Brave <b>Fencer</b> Musashi was having Miyamoto Musashi fighting in an alternate world from where he belonged. While the game conceptualized as an action oriented, Musashi was originally meant to be a wanderer. However, he was later changed to an itinerant Samaritan in order to have him interacting and helping other characters. During development, the team used an action base which was crucial to the game's fighting mechanics. Director Yoichi Yoshimoto was focused on the game's fully polygonal aspects that were a departure from Square's previous works. The development team prioritized the movement of polygons in real time and how light affected their appearance.|$|E

5|$|The Legend of Zelda is {{considered}} a spiritual forerunner of the modern role-playing video game (RPG) genre. Though it is often not {{considered part of the}} genre since it lacked key RPG mechanics such as experience points, it had many features in common with RPGs and served as the template for the action role-playing game genre. The game's fantasy setting, musical style and action-adventure gameplay were adopted by many RPGs. Its commercial success helped lay the groundwork for involved, non-linear games in fantasy settings, such as those found in successful RPGs, including Crystalis, Soul Blazer, Square's Seiken Densetsu series, Alundra, and Brave <b>Fencer</b> Musashi. The popularity of the game also spawned several clones trying to emulate the game.|$|E

40|$|To {{avoid being}} hit, <b>fencers</b> {{typically}} adopt an {{out of range}} position, which was hypothesized to be governed by body- and action-scaled affordances. This theory was measured in elite and national level junior (u 20) <b>fencers.</b> Associations between “reachability” of lunging and step-lunging attacks, was assessed against height, arm-span, leg-span, body mass and lower-body power, and then compared across level. Reachability was determined as the distance covered by <b>fencers</b> during these attacks and was reported as actual and estimated distances. Elite <b>fencers</b> are better at estimating their lunging and step-lunge distance compared to national ranked junior <b>fencers</b> (- 0. 9 vs. 7. 3 % and 5. 4 vs. 10. 9 % respectively). Surprisingly, elite fencers’ actual and estimated distances for these was less than the junior fencers’ (222. 6 vs. 251. 5 cm and 299. 3 vs. 360. 2 cm respectively), and significantly so in the former. Finally only arm (r =. 81) and leg span (r =. 71) were significantly correlated to estimated lunging distance and this was only in elite <b>fencers.</b> Findings suggest that better <b>fencers</b> can accurately predict their attack range and that reachability appears to be positively influenced by arm and leg-span; these may feed in to talent identification. Given that distances were less in elite <b>fencers,</b> findings suggests that timing and distance estimation are key skills to master, and that the mastery of these in offensive actions can mitigate to a large extent, the physical benefits of an opponent’s greater height...|$|R
