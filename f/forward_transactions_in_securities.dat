40|$|This paper {{considers}} a hedging {{model of a}} risk-averse competitive firm facing output price uncertainty. Imperfections exist <b>in</b> <b>forward</b> <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> that the firm faces a downward-sloping demand function for its forward sales. We show that the optimal output and hedge ratio of the firm are, in general, not separable, and are related in a deterministic manner. We also derive some economic implications of production and hedging decisions when firms differ in their attitudes towards risk. A more risk-averse firm is shown to produce less and hedge more than a less risk-averse firm. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|One way to {{deal with}} the foreign {{exchange}} risk is to engage <b>in</b> a <b>forward</b> <b>transaction.</b> <b>In</b> this <b>transaction,</b> money does not actually change hands until some agreed upon future date. A buyer and seller agree on an exchange rate for any date in the future, and the transaction occurs on that date, regardless of what the market rates are then. The duration of the trade can be one day, a few days, months or years. Usually the date is decided by both parties. Then the forward contract is negotiated and agreed upon by both parties.|$|R

40|$|In its 2010 {{decision}} in Morrison v. National Australia Bank, the Supreme Court {{held that the}} general anti-fraud provision of U.

40|$|A {{model of}} tenure choice is {{presented}} which treats {{the benefits and}} costs of homeownership from a theory of finance perspective. The incremental benefits from homeownership over renting housing services are from two sources: protection against rental price risk (a <b>forward</b> <b>transaction</b> <b>in</b> the housing market) and from a possible capital gain from the eventual sale of a house (substitutes for portfolio investment). The cost of these benefits is higher initial outlay on housing, which reduces the funds available for portfolio investments. The comparative statics of this model is presented. It is shown that rental risk and portfolio risk add {{to the value of}} homeownership. Since homeownership is a partial substitute for portfolio investment, it is shown that the lower the covariance between portfolio returns and future home prices the more valuable is homeownership. In the presence of differential borrowing opportunities it is shown that the leverage available to housing significantly increases the value of homeownership.

5000|$|Portfolio {{investments}} typically involve <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> {{that are}} highly liquid, i.e. they can be bought and sold very quickly. A portfolio investment is an investment made by an investor who {{is not involved in}} the management of a company. This is in contrast to direct investment, which allows an investor to exercise a certain degree of managerial control over a company. Equity investments where the owner holds less than 10% of a company's shares are classified as portfolio investment. These transactions are also referred to as [...] "portfolio flows" [...] and are recorded in the financial account of a country's balance of payments. According to the Institute of International Finance, portfolio flows arise through the transfer of ownership of securities from one country to another.|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the modern system of securities holding through intermediaries poses particularly difficult conflict of laws issues. The traditional approach to conflict of laws suggests that the law governing a <b>transaction</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> {{is determined by the}} location of the securities; yet under modern conditions it is difficult in practice, if not impossible in theory, to determine that location. A recent project of the Hague Conference on Private International Law has confronted these problems and devised a workable, modern approach. For any such project to succeed, lawyers must be willing to abandon traditional concepts of conflict of laws such as “lex situs” or “party autonomy. ” Rather, lawyers must be willing to adopt an approach to conflict of laws that is responsive to the needs and realities of the modern system of securities holding through intermediaries. This Article explores some of the basic problems that must be confronted in that effort...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} legal {{jurisdiction}} {{is considered an}} integral part of sovereignty and one in which States naturally assume responsibility to adjudicate on matters and persons within their territorial boundaries. Except by mutual consent, no State is allowed to undermine the sovereign authority of another by enacting and applying its laws to matters and persons within the jurisdiction of that other State except in circumstances permitted under conflict of law principles. However, global expansion of commerce, flourishing of multinational corporations, and technological revolution, has not only increased international <b>transaction</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities,</b> but also market abuses, fraud and manipulative conduct associated with domestic securities markets have spread across borders. So, instead of jurisdiction based on conventional principles, a State justify extraterritorial application of its national securities regulation if the abusive, fraudulent or manipulative conduct of foreign persons imposes negative externalities on the State, its economy, and investors.

40|$|The authors assess empirically {{the impact}} of {{contractual}} savings institutions portfolios (pension funds and life insurance companies) on securities markets, for example, depth and liquidity in the domestic stock market, and depth in the domestic bond market. They discuss how the institutionalization of savings can modify financial markets through the lengthening of securities'maturities. The results are the following: 1) An increase in assets of contractual savings institutions relative to domestic financial assets has {{a positive impact on}} the depth of stock and bond markets on average. 2) The impact on stock market depth and liquidity is nonlinear: it is stronger in countries where corporate information is more transparent. 3) There is evidence of a significant heterogeneity among countries: contractual savings have a stronger impact on <b>securities</b> markets <b>in</b> countries where the financial system is market based, pension fund contributions are mandatory, and international <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> are lower. 4) The authors do not find that {{the impact of}} contractual savings institutions on securities markets is explained by the overall level of development, education, demographic structure or the legal environment.

40|$|Securities have {{replaced}} bank lending {{in recent years}} as the primary means through which funds are invested internationally, and in the process, the share of U.

S. long-term securities (equities and long-term debt) that was foreign-owned increased from about 5 percent to about 12 percent. At the same time, U. S. holdings of foreign long-term securities also increased, although their growth did not match the rapid growth in foreign holdings of U. S. securities. At $ 1. 8 trillion, the value of U. S. holdings of foreign long-term securities at the end of 2002 was less than half the value of foreign holdings of U.
