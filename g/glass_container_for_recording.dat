Methods: ReNu with MoistureLoc was stored in its Bausch 2 ̆ 6 Lomb (Rochester, New York) plastic or similarly sized <b>glass</b> <b>containers</b> <b>for</b> 1 and 4 weeks at room temperature, 42 °C, and 56 °C, and then tested for its ability to inhibit growth of 7 Fusarium isolates. Results: ReNu with MoistureLoc stored in <b>glass</b> <b>containers</b> <b>for</b> 1 or 4 weeks at all 3 temperatures demonstrated no significant fungistatic deterioration. However, ReNuML stored at 56 °C in its Bausch 2 ̆ 6 Lomb plastic container demonstrated a statistically significant fungistatic deterioration compared with room temperature storage in its original plastic <b>container</b> or with <b>glass</b> <b>container</b> storage at any temperature. Conclusion: When exposed to elevated storage temperature, it appears that an interaction between ReNuML and its Bausch 2 ̆ 6 Lomb plastic container adversely affects the fungistatic properties of ReNuML, which could have contributed to the Fusarium keratitis epidemic of 2004 through 2006...|$|R

40|$|Issue: A {{successful}} program <b>for</b> re-washing recycled <b>glass</b> <b>containers</b> <b>for</b> use in {{applications such}} as wine bottling depends on overcoming a number of challenges, including developing collection infrastructure, sorting diverse bottle streams, achieving efficient washing, and market penetration. Bottle washing programs may focus {{on a variety of}} bottle types, including beer bottles, wine bottles, or juice bottles. This Best Practice focuses on the key elements of a wine bottle-washing program, although many of the concepts are applicable to other containers. A successful bottle-washing program requires the integration of collection and supply infrastructure, sorting protocols, and equipment selection. Best Practice: Historically, bottles were manufactured to heavy specifications as returnables. Today, most <b>glass</b> <b>containers</b> are manufactured as one-way containers, not intended to withstand the rigors of multiple re-washings. Wine bottles remain an exception. Wine bottles manufactured in the United States generally have the same weight as those manufactured in Europe, where washing wine bottles is a common procedure. Because it contains a non-pressurized liquid, a wine bottle does not have the same potential to break from pressure, as does a defective container of beer or soda. However, the development of coated glass bottles may lead to lighter weight wine bottles as well. In addition, only regions with an adequate wine production industry are potential locations for wine bottle washing facilities. Finally, wine bottles wholesale for 35 ¢- 40 ¢each, while beer bottles cost only about 10 ¢, so washing may be more economically feasible for wine bottles. The collection of bottles must be structured to maximize the recovery of usable containers. Certai...|$|R

At a steady pH of 6. 9 the most probable soil redox equilibrium that controls the E, value at this level could be the Fe+++lFeti system. The fall in pH was from 7. 5 to 6. 9 only, probably owing to the presence of low organic carbon content. The bulk resistance decreased from 300 to 150 ohms due to the release of ions into the soil solution.

Chemicals including bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, parabens, 4 -nonylphenol (4 NP) and triclosan {{have been linked}} to disruption of endocrine pathways and altered hormonal status in both animal and human studies. Additionally, changes in estrogen metabolism have been associated with pediatric endocrine disorders and linked to estrogen-dependent cancers.

Therefore, seeds were stored in cloth bags, plastic bags and <b>glass</b> <b>containers</b> <b>for</b> 531 days, both at room temperature and in a cold chamber.

Data were submitted to polynomial regression analysis, {{for each of the}} combination of packaging/storage condition. The results obtained led to the following considerations: a) the speed germination index and the accelerated aging test permitted a good evaluation of the seed-lots quality; b) the first count of germination did not allow any prediction about seed lots vigor; c) seedling fresh and dry matter did not discriminate among seed lots; d) electrical conductivity test after 2 h imbibitions was not adequate to evaluate the seed lots vigor and e) the electric conductivity test with 24 h imbibitions was more adequate to differentiate among seed lots, but with little efficiency to discriminate among seed lots with intermediate vigor or with low quality differences...|$|R

Freshly cut buds or flowers were treated in <b>glass</b> <b>containers</b> <b>for</b> 8 hours with 6 μl/liter of highly purified 14 C 2 H 4. Following removal of dissolved 14 C 2 H 4, radioactivity was determined for the different flower tissues and trappd CO 2. 14 C 2 H 4 oxidation to 14 CO 2 and tissue incorporation occurred at very low to nondetectable levels 2 to 3 days prior to flower opening. About 1 day prior to full bloom, just at the time when mature buds become responsive to ethylene (Kende and Hanson, Plant Physiol 1976, 57 : 523 - 527), there was a dramatic increase in the capacity of the buds to oxidize 14 C 2 H 4 to 14 CO 2. This activity continued to increase until the flower was fully opened reaching a peak activity of 2, 500 dpm per three flowers per 8 hours. It then declined as the flower closed and rapidly senesced. A similar but smaller peak occurred in tissue incorporation and it was followed by a second peak during late flower senescence. This first peak in tissue incorporation and the dramatic peak in ethylene oxidation slightly preceded a large peak of natural ethylene production which accompanied flower senescence. The ethylene metabolism observed was clearly dependent on cellular metabolism and did not involve microorganisms since heat killing destroyed this activity and badly contaminated heat-killed flowers were unable to metabolize ethylene...|$|R
40|$|Effect of {{surfaces}} of earthenware pots, glass, plastic {{and stainless steel}} containers on the physicochemical and bacteriological (biofilm formation) quality of borehole and atmospheric water stored for twelve days were determined using standard analytical and bacteriological techniques. Susceptibility of the bacterial isolates to different antibiotics was also determined using standard Kirby-Bauer agar disc diffusion procedures. The physicochemical parameters determined for borehole water sample were within WHO permissible standard while rain water sample recorded slightly higher values for NO 3 -, and NO­ 2 - (10. 2 mgL- 1 and 0. 045 mgL- 1 respectively) than WHO standards of 10 mgL- 1 and 0. 02 mgL- 1 respectively. Biofilm bacterial communities from stored borehole water consisted of nine genera including Pseudomonas, Micrococcus, Klebsiella, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Escherichia, Proteus, Serratia, and Enterobacter. The recovery rate of the various bacterial genera were 40 % in earthenware pot, 80 % in plastic, 70 % in stainless steel and 60 % of the genera were isolated from <b>glass</b> <b>container</b> <b>for</b> stored borehole water. Fewer bacterial genera were isolated from stored atmospheric water and these included Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Yersinia. The isolates were recovered at the rates of 40 %, 80 %, 60 % and 40 % in earthenware pot, plastic, stainless steel and <b>glass</b> <b>containers</b> respectively. While Escherichia coli, Yersinia sp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited remarkable sensitivity to Septrin (30 μg), Ampicillin (30 μg), Augmentin (30 μg) and Nalidixic acid (10 μg) as evinced by clear zones of inhibition, Enterobacter sp, Klebsiella sp and Proteus sp were moderately sensitive {{to some of the}} tested antibiotics. Amongst the gram positive bacteria, Micrococcus sp was most sensitive to the various antibiotics. Although Staphylococcus aureus showed resistance to most of the tested antibiotics, it was sensitive to Erythromycin (30 μg) and Chloramphenicol (30 μg). It could be deduced from the above results that the physicochemical and bacteriological quality of stored water are affected by both the source of the water and type of storage vessel. Although the effect of the vessels are not definitive, the levels of pH, Mg 2 +, NO 2 -, NO 3 - and hardness are enhanced in water stored in earthenware pots.
