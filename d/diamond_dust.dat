40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} six patients (six eyes) {{who developed}} an eccentric macular hole after surgery for idiopathic epimacular proliferation. Materials and Methods: Review of records from six patients who developed eccentric macular holes postoperatively following vitrectomy in 107 consecutive cases with peeling of the epimacular proliferation and internal limiting membrane (ILM) from June 2004 to January 2009, Results: Eccentric macular holes were developed from nine days {{to eight months}} (mean, 3. 1 months) after epimacular proliferation peeling. The ILM was peeled {{in addition to the}} epimacular proliferation in five of the six cases. Of the six eccentric macular holes, four were located temporal to the fovea, one was located superior to the fovea, and one was located nasal to the fovea. Final visual acuities after a mean follow-up period of 17. 3 months were 20 / 20 in two eyes, 20 / 25 in one eye, 20 / 40 in two eyes, and 5 / 200 in one eye. The eye with the eccentric macular hole nasal to the fovea had the poorest final visual acuity of 5 / 200. Conclusion: Eccentric macular holes occurring after vitrectomy to remove epimacular proliferation is an uncommon postoperative finding. Various explanations have been suggested for the etiology of these holes, but there is no consensus. We suggested that the ILM tear should be initiated with a <b>diamond</b> <b>dusted</b> knife to reduce the likelihood of injury to the underlying Muller cells that may contribute to the formation of eccentric macular holes...|$|R

40|$|Today's {{composites}} {{may contain}} high amounts of nanofillers. Objectives: To characterize composite dust {{to determine whether}} possibly hazardous respirable (< 5 µm) dust particles may be released upon grinding or polishing composites. We hypothesized that upon grinding/polishing, the filler particles would remain well embedded in the resin matrix and that no respirable dust would be released. Methods: Standardized blocks of polymerized composite were ground with a <b>diamond</b> bur; and <b>dust</b> was collected on 1 -µm pore-size filters and weighed. The released dust was also quantified and ultra-morphologically characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Both (microfilled) hybrid composites (Z 100, 3 M ESPE; Gradia Anterior, GC), and (hybrid-) nanocomposites (Filtek Supreme, 3 M ESPE; Tetric EvoCeram, Ivoclar, Vivadent; CeramX, Dentsply; Premise, Kerr; Herculite XRV Ultra, Kerr) were tested. Results: Gravimetrical analysis revealed that all composites released appreciable amounts of respirable dust, with air concentrations from 7 - 32 mg/m 3 immediately after grinding the composites. In addition, electron microscopic analysis revealed that composites may also release high amounts of particles smaller than 1 µm and even 100 nm. The ratio of dust particles smaller than 1 µm to those larger than 1 µm ranged between 3 : 1 to 9 : 1. The respirable fraction of the composite dust most often consisted of multiple fillers in the resin matrix, but also of single nanofillers. Conclusion: Contemporary composites may release small respirable dust particles. Dentists should be urged to always wear protective masks, and to use water coolant during the polishing or removal of composites. However, more research is necessary to determine possible health hazards of the released composite dust. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Stable {{pressure}} systems over interior Alaska sometimes produce [...] prolonged, extreme (below - 40 °C) cold spells at the surface. The {{meteorological conditions}} responsible for two such cold spells are discussed [...] {{in detail in}} Appendix A, where it is shown {{that the rate of}} radiative [...] cooling of the air is enhanced by suspended ice crystals which are themselves [...] a result of the initial cooling. [...] Radiation fogs formed during the onset of cold spells are generally [...] of short duration because the air soon becomes desiccated. These fogs [...] consist of supercooled water droplets until the air temperature goes below [...] the "spontaneous freezing point” for water droplets (about - 40 °C); the [...] fog then becomes an ice crystal fog, or simply "Ice Fog". During the [...] cooling cycle water is gradually condensed out of the air until the [...] droplets freeze. At this point there is a sharp, discontinuous decrease [...] in the saturation vapor pressure of the air because it must be reckoned [...] over ice rather than over water. The polluted air over Fairbanks allows [...] droplets to begin freezing at the relatively high temperature of - 35 °C. [...] Between - 35 and - 40 °C the amount of water vapor condensed by freezing [...] of supercooled water droplets is 3 to 5 times greater than the amount [...] condensed by 1 °C of cooling at these temperatures. This results in [...] rapid and widespread formation of ice fog (Appendix B) which persists [...] in the Fairbanks area as long as the cold spell lasts. The persistence [...] of Fairbanks ice fog depends on a continual source of moisture [...] (4 [...] 1 x 10 ^ 6 Kg H 2 O per day) from human activities within the fog. [...] Ice fog crystals are an order of magnitude smaller than <b>diamond</b> [...] <b>dust,</b> or cirrus cloud crystals, which in turn are an order of magnitude [...] smaller than common snow crystals (0. 01, 0. 1 and 1 to 5 -mm respectively). [...] The differences in size are shown to result from differences in cooling [...] rates over 5 orders of magnitude. Most of the ice fog crystals have [...] settling rates which are slower than the upward velocity of air over [...] the city center. The upward air movement is caused by convection cells [...] driven by the 6 °C "heat island" over Fairbanks. This causes a reduced [...] precipitation rate which permits the density of ice fog in the city [...] center to be three times greater than that in the outlying areas. [...] The inversions which occur during cold spells over Fairbanks begin [...] at ground level and are among the strongest and most persistent in the [...] world. They are three times stronger than those in the inversion layer [...] over Los Angeles. Thus, the low-lying air over Fairbanks stagnates [...] and becomes effectively decoupled from the atmosphere above, permitting [...] high concentrations of all pollutants. The combustion of fuel oil, [...] gasoline, and coal provides daily inputs of: 4. 1 x 10 ^ 6 kg CO 2; [...] 8. 6 x 10 ^ 3 kg SO 2; and 60, 46 and 20 kg of Pb, Br and Cl respectively, [...] into a lens-like layer of air resting on the surface with a total [...] volume less than 3 x 10 ^ 9 m^ 3.

40|$|This study re-conceptualises the {{community}} play as {{an aspect of}} contemporary British theatre. In {{the context of the}} idea of an arts entitlement which has two components, participation and enjoyment, it examines three antecedents to current practice. These are: theatre and empowerment, which looks at the work of Brecht and Boal on conceptions of the audience; outreach work, which examines the de-mystification of art by looking at the relationship between theatre and education and community arts, which focuses on harnessing the creative potential of ordinary people. The lines of development which link these three areas to {{the community}} play are investigated. The history and origins of the form are outlined and Ann Jellicoe's work with the Colway Theatre Trust is examined. The study offers a new conceptual vocabulary for the analysis of community playmaking which has three principal terms: aesthetic materialism - a development of Marxist principles as they relate to a consideration of the aesthetic circumstances of the people; aesthetic justice - an application of Beardsley's concept to contemporary society and current theatre practice; and communal theatre - a new term developed {{as a result of this}} study which clarifies the differences between participation and collaboration in the making of community theatre. These three concepts are united by their relationship to the rejection of bourgeois control of cultural capital which underpins the investigative stance of the study. Contemporary society is characterised by the study as aesthetically unjust and the main questions it asks relate the search for aesthetic justice to the developing form of the community play. The theoretical investigations of the study are contextualized by fieldwork which consisted of a participant observation case study of the community department of the Belgrade theatre, Coventry. This spanned two years and focused on the 1992 Coventry community play <b>Diamonds</b> in the <b>Dust.</b> The study concludes with a comparison of the main forms of participatory theatre in the 1990 s which offers a means of identifying the heuristic value of the various models of community playmaking with respect to their potential for empowerment and contribution to aesthetic justice. The implications of the study are that the participatory element of the arts entitlement needs to be strengthened into true collaboration between the professionals and the non-professionals involved in order to ensure equality of access to, and popular control of, the cultural capital which is symbolised by the community play. Communal theatre projects of this sort are assessed as being able to promote the kind of shared experience which is necessary for the development of a more aesthetically just society...|$|R
