25|$|Some Inuit {{later told}} the {{investigating}} policemen a different story. One man, an Inuit elder named Koeha, {{told the story}} quite differently.

Although the Inuit who had stolen the weapon wanted to kill Le Roux, the priests managed to escape. Sinnisiak and Uloqsaq began to follow the priests, and caught up with them at Bloody Falls, where Sinnisiak stabbed and shot the two men. Although Uloqsaq assisted on Sinnisiak's urging, he said {{that he did not want}} to kill the priest and only did so because he had been told to by Sinnisiak.|$|E
25|$|The Yamal baby mammoth Lyuba, {{found in}} 2007 in the Yamal Peninsula in Western Siberia, {{suggests}} that baby mammoths, as do modern baby elephants, ate the dung of adult animals. The {{evidence to show}} {{this is that the}} dentition (teeth) of the baby mammoth had not yet fully developed to chew grass. Furthermore, there was an abundance of ascospores of coprophilous fungi from the pollen spectrum of the baby's mother. Coprophilous fungi are fungi that grow on animal dung and disperse spores in nearby vegetation, which the baby mammoth would then consume. Spores might have <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> its stomach while grazing for the first few times. Coprophagy may be an adaptation, serving to populate the infant's gut with the needed microbiome for digestion.|$|E
25|$|Walker reentered Virginia, in Loudoun County on September 9, {{across from}} Point of Rocks. Walker was escorted by Col. E.V. White, Loudoun native, and his 35th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry. White {{was unhappy with}} the {{assignment}} and preferred {{to be with the}} rest of the army. Unfortunately White had <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> an altercation with Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart in Frederick and was subsequently ordered back to Virginia by Lee. Whether or not his disposition was to blame, White led Walker on a meandering route around the Short Hill Mountain to reach the base of Loudoun Heights four days later on September 13. So the attack on Harpers Ferry that had been planned for September 11 was delayed, increasing the risk that McClellan might engage and destroy a portion of Lee's army while it was divided.|$|E

25|$|While {{growing up}} Davis {{was known as}} Little Pops. His second home was the Phyllis Wheatley {{settlement}} house. Its director Gertrude Brown gave the area's children continuing education {{in a safe place}} to go after school. Davis must have <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> trouble at some point as it was a juvenile parole officer who suggested he attend Phyllis Wheatley. There with his friends, Davis learned boxing, etiquette and Robert's Rules of Order. They met Chick Webb and danced to Duke Ellington and Count Basie who stayed there on tours to the Orpheum Theatre. In 1941, he graduated from North High School where he lettered in and won a city championship in boxing. Davis attended the University of Minnesota and later in life received an honorary doctorate in law from Macalester College.|$|E
25|$|As this {{so-called}} culture fight was originally one between Catholics and more Protestant, Bismark-oriented and Prussia-friendly group of people, Hubertia was cought in the middle. Becker was a politician {{of the catholic}} Centrum party and openly voiced that Catholics only made it into higher offices {{in the area of}} Baden-Württemberg when they had been members of Hubertia. This can be understood as a typical statement during the cultural war (Kulturkampf) with Köhler voicing his antipathy towards the fraternity of Hubertia. On the other hand, Hasel completely disproves Köhller's view: He points out that the view of Catholics only having <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> higher office positions if they had been Hubertia's members must be false as access to Baden's office career track was not bound by confession. Catholic forestry office applicants were not hindered on their path, which is proven by several of personnel files.|$|E

On the May 23 episode of Raw, Del Rio slapped Big Show after he had <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> a confrontation with Ricardo Rodriguez. After competing in a match, Show was run over by Del Rio's car, driven by Rodriguez, leaving him sidelined with a storyline knee injury. Show made his return three weeks later, chasing Del Rio {{out of the ring}} and beating Rodriguez down. On June 19 at Capitol Punishment, Del Rio defeated Show via referee stoppage, when he was unable to continue the match {{as a result of a}} pre-match assault by Mark Henry. On the June 27 episode of Raw, Del Rio defeated Show in a steel cage match, again with help from Mark Henry.|$|E

25|$|In May 2013, Kiki is {{introduced}} as the girlfriend of Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig) who has <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> trouble with gambling debt. When Morgan's brother Michael (Chad Duell) forces Morgan {{to go back}} home to Port Charles, Kiki follows and moves in with Morgan and Michael. While they initially get off on the wrong foot, Kiki softens toward Michael when she learns why he is so protective of Morgan. Kiki is shocked when her mother Ava Jerome (Maura West) confesses that her father, Franco (Roger Howarth) is very much alive. In addition, Kiki is also shocked to learn that Ava is a member of powerful Jerome crime family that is challenging Michael and Morgan's father Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) for his territory. After they kiss, Michael and Kiki are led to believe they are cousins. Noticing the attraction, Morgan convinces Kiki to marry him in the summer of 2013 only for it to be revealed that Kiki is the biological daughter of Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton). To divert his new bride's attention, Morgan resorts to buying Kiki expensive gifts. The marriage quickly implodes when Kiki learns that Morgan knew about her paternity before they married and she files for an annulment. Despite {{the fact that she is}} now dating Michael, Kiki is furious to discover Morgan and Ava are having an affair.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{inconsistency}} as {{to whether}} the Doctor can recognise his own future incarnations. In the original series, the Doctors usually have no difficulty recognising one another (in The Three Doctors, the First, Second, and Third Doctors all know one another on sight. However, in The Five Doctors, the First Doctor does not recognise the Fifth Doctor as himself and needs to be introduced by the Fifth as his fourth regeneration. In Time Crash, after the TARDIS is at different points in its own timeline merge due to downed shields, the Fifth Doctor spends much of the mini-episode believing that the Tenth was merely a fan who had somehow <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> his TARDIS, having somehow altered the 'desktop theme'; the Tenth Doctor constantly tries to convince his younger self that he is his future self, only doing so by using a predestination paradox to cancel out a universe-destroying black hole with a supernova by blowing up the TARDIS. When the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctor meet each other in The Day Of The Doctor, the Tenth Doctor appears to sceptically recognise his successor, yet he appears to be fully convinced only after both compare their respective sonic screwdrivers. The War Doctor on the other hand is initially completely oblivious to meet two of his future regenerations (initially mistaking them for future companions), again being convinced by their sonic screwdrivers.|$|E
