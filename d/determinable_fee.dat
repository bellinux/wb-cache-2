5000|$|A {{defeasible estate}} is created when a grantor {{transfers}} land conditionally. Upon the happening {{of the event}} or condition stated by the grantor, the transfer may be void or at least subject to annulment. (An estate not subject to such conditions is called an indefeasible estate.) Historically, the common law has frowned {{on the use of}} defeasible estates as it interferes with the owners' enjoyment of their property and as such has made it difficult to create a valid future interest. Unless a defeasible estate is clearly intended, modern courts will construe the language against this type of estate. Three types of defeasible estates are the fee simple <b>determinable,</b> <b>fee</b> simple subject to an executory limitation or interest, and the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.|$|E
5000|$|When {{presented}} {{with oil and}} gas cases, early common law jurists were somewhat reluctant to recognize a corporeal possessory interest in substances they considered to be fugacious or “wild and migratory,” and therefore subject to loss by drainage. Among U.S. states, two different theories of ownership {{of oil and gas}} arose. Some states, such as Texas, have adopted the “ownership-in-place” theory for oil and gas that a landowner owns a corporeal possessory interest (similar to a fee simple) in the substances beneath his land, but his ownership is a <b>determinable</b> <b>fee</b> subject to the rule of capture. [...] Other states, like Oklahoma, have adopted the “exclusive-right-to-take” theory that a landowner does not own the substances that underlie his land, but merely retains the exclusive right to capture the substances, a non-corporeal interest. The difference between the two theories is primarily of import in determining remedies.|$|E
50|$|Fee simple estates may {{be either}} fee simple {{absolute}} or defeasible (i.e. subject to future conditions) like <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> and <b>fee</b> simple subject to condition subsequent; this is the complex system of future interests (q.v.) which allows concepts of trusts and estates to elide into actuarial science {{through the use of}} life contingencies.|$|R
5000|$|If {{previous}} grantors of a {{fee simple}} estate do not create any conditions for subsequent grantees, then the title is called fee simple absolute. A fee simple absolute is the highest estate permitted by law and it gives the holder full possessory rights and obligations {{now and in the}} future. Other {{fee simple estate}}s in real property include fee simple defeasible (or <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable)</b> estates. A defeasible estate is created when a grantor places a condition on a fee simple estate (in the deed). When a specified event happens, the estate may become void or subject to annulment. There are two types of defeasible estates: <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> and the <b>fee</b> simple subject to a condition subsequent. If the grantor uses durational language in the condition such as [...] "to A. as long as the land is used for a park", then upon the happening of the specified event (in this case if the land is used for anything other than a park), the estate will automatically terminate and revert to the grantor or the grantor's estate; this is called a <b>fee</b> simple <b>determinable.</b> If the grantor uses language such as [...] "but if alcohol is served", then the grantor or the heirs have a right of entry if the condition occurs, but the estate does not automatically revert to the grantor; this is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. In most jurisdictions in the United States these concepts have been modified by statute. <b>Fee</b> simple <b>determinable</b> was generally preferred by courts in the common law of the early United States. Recently, that trend has reversed, and most courts in the United States will find a fee simple subject to condition subsequent in situations where the conveying document's language is unclear.|$|R
