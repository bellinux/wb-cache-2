5000|$|In Northern Europe, {{the disease}} occurs after winter housing. But in Australia and New Zealand, where the cows are not housed, the disease occurs in similar conditions, when the animal enters lush, grass-dominant pastures. [...] In North America, <b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> occurs most {{commonly}} when range stock are moved onto lush early pasture or when housed stock are turned out onto such pasture in the spring. A second high-risk period may {{occur in the}} fall. Although cereal grasses (e.g. winter wheat) and crested wheatgrass may be especially conducive to <b>grass</b> <b>tetany,</b> the problem can also occur with several other grass species.

50|$|<b>Grass</b> <b>tetany</b> or hypomagnesemic tetany, {{also known}} as grass {{staggers}} and winter tetany, is a metabolic disease involving magnesium deficiency, which can occur in such ruminant livestock as beef cattle, dairy cattle and sheep, usually after grazing on pastures of rapidly growing grass, especially in early spring.|$|E
50|$|High {{potassium}} intake {{relative to}} calcium and magnesium intake may induce hypomagnesemia. A K/(Ca+Mg) charge ratio exceeding 2.2 in forages has been commonly considered {{a risk factor}} for <b>grass</b> <b>tetany.</b> Potassium fertilizer application to increase forage production may contribute to an increased K/(Ca+Mg) ratio in forage plants, not only by adding potassium to soil, but also by displacing soil-adsorbed calcium and magnesium by ion exchange, contributing to increased susceptibility of calcium and magnesium to leaching loss from the root zone during rainy seasons. In ruminants, high potassium intake results in decreased absorption of magnesium from the digestive tract.|$|E

Attempts to reduce the inci-dence of <b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> through application of fertilizer Mg have not generally been successful. Dietary Mg supplementation adds to the annual labor and cost of production and does not always ensure all animals receive adequate amounts of the mineral. Selective breeding of forages for higher levels of Mg and lower tetany ratio may offer a long-term solution to the <b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> problem.

40|$|Magnesium (Mg) is an {{essential}} mineral for all cattle, especially lactating cows and as such is routinely administered as a feed supplement. A diet low in Mg can have serious implications on performance and ultimately lead to hypomagnesemic tetany and death in ruminants. Similarly a diet high in potassium (K) can {{increase the risk of}} <b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> due to its inhibitory effect on Mg absorption (Elliott, 2007). The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a method based on the manipulation of the Calcium (Ca), K and Mg ratio (<b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> hazard ratio; Elliott, 2007) to induce hypomagnesemic tetany in lactating dairy cattle. If successful, this method can then be used to investigate the physiological response of lactating dairy cattle to Mg supplementation. Four lactating multi-parous Holstein Freisian cows, 4 - 8 years in age and yielding approximately 20 litres of milk per day, were allocated to the study. The cows were housed in individual pens and fed ad libitum a total mixed ration consisting of chaffed Rhodes grass hay, whole cotton seed, concentrate pellets and a molassesbased liquid feed from 0 to 48 h. Blood samples were taken for mineral analysis. Individual indwelling venous catheters were inserted at 48 h and a blood sample taken from each cow. At 48 h, cattle were given a K challenge, by means of a total mixed ration with a <b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> hazard ratio (K/Ca + Mg) in excess of 2. 2 (Elliott, 2007). Blood samples were taken every 6 hours during the challenge period. Cattle were closely monitored for signs of clinical hypomagnesaemia. At the commencement of the study, the mean plasma magnesium levels were within the normal physiological range (0. 70 – 1. 23 mmol/l) for this mineral (Radostits et al. 2000). Subclinical hypomagnesaemia was induced within 12 h of changing the diet (Figure 1). Although plasma Mg concentrations fell below safe physiological levels (Radostits et al. 2000), the cows were not observed to display clinical signs of hypomagnesaemia. Through the manipulation of the <b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> hazard ratio within a feed ration, a successful method of inducing hypomagnesaemia has been demonstrated in this study. We propose that this method can be used to investigate the physiological response of lactating cattle to Mg supplementation when challenged with a high <b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> hazard ratio diet...|$|E

40|$|<b>Grass</b> <b>tetany</b> {{is caused}} by {{magnesium}} deficiency. Magnesium (Mg) is required for proper function of the nerves that control muscle contraction. If Mg levels become too low, animals go into convulsions and many times, die. It is most common in mature beef cows with superior milking ability. Magnesium levels are low in cool-season forages during the initial growth period in the spring. Gill et al. (2002) reported that pasture samples collected during the first 10 days of May during 2001 and 2002 average 0. 22 percent Mg. This level is sufficiently low to be a predisposing factor for <b>grass</b> <b>tetany.</b> O’Kelly and Fontenot (1973) reported that Mg availability from forage is low. The National Research Council suggests the range of availability of Mg from forage is 10 to 37 percent (NRC, 1996). Other factors reduce magnesium availability. Potassium (K), for example, may interfere with magnesium utilization. Significant interference can be predicted at levels in the 2. 5 to 3. 0 percent range. The average K levels in samples reported by Gill et al (2002) was 2. 7 percent. Using averages, this is a 12 : 1 K:Mg ratio, which suggests tha...|$|E

However, the mechanism for enhanced Mg uptake in HiMag leaves has not been determined. The objective was to investigate if increased Mg uptake in HiMag {{could be explained by}} differences in elemental distribution among plant parts, root characteristics, or organic acid concentrations compared to its parental cultivars, ‘‘Kentucky 31 ’’ (KY 31) and ‘‘Missouri 96 ’’ (MO 96). The study was conducted on a surface-irrigated calcareous Portneuf silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, mesic, Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcid). Vegetation and soil cores of 7. 6 -cm diameter were sampled to a 45 -cm soil depth in 15 -cm increments. Mass and ash were determined for leaves, crowns, and roots. Leaf area, root length, root area, root length density, elemental concentration, and uptake [potassium (K), calcium (Ca), Mg, sodium (Na), and phosphorus (P) ], and malate and citrate concentrations also were determined. Leaf Mg concentration was higher in HiMag than parental cultivars. HiMag generally did not differ in crown and root elemental concentrations from its parents.

40|$|Selenium is {{an element}} {{necessary}} for good animal health. No in-formation is available on inheritance of Se concentration in tall fes-cue (Festuca arundinacea Shreb.). Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} investigation was to determine the nature of genetic variation of Se concentration in tall fescue. To accomplish this objective, 15 paren-tal clones were randomly chosen from a broad-based population, and their half-sib (HS) progenies were generated using a polycross mat-ing design. Selenium analysis was determined flourometrically by digesting dried, ground herbage samples in 3 : 1 HNO 3 /HCIO 4. Sig-nificant genetic variation was observed among HS families in the fall for Se concentration. Heritability, calculated using parent-off-spring (PO) regression, gave estimates of 18 % for summer and 68 % for the fall. Heritability and genetic gain estimates were maximized in the fall, as compared with the summer, largely because of a large environmental component. Genetic gain, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} mean of parents, predicted an advance of 1 9 % for fall herbage. Progress in selecting for improved concentrations of Se in the fall in this population of tall fescue is likely. INHERITANCE of mineral concentrations in cool-sea- 1 son forage grasses has largely concentrated on the elements Mg, Ca, and K (Sleper et al., 1989).

40|$|A heavily nitrogen-fertilized kikuyu pasture grown under {{acid soil}} {{conditions}} in northern New South Wales sampled at two week intervals {{over a period}} of one year. The concentrations of calcium throughout the year (0. 15 - 0. 28 %) and phosphorus from late winter to early summer (0. 20 - 0. 28 %) were well below the values normally considered to be required by milking cows and some classes of beef cattle. The nitrogen concentrations reached minimal values of 1. 8 - 2. 2 % in winter, which appear to be adequate for milk production. From summer through to the end of winter, the ratio of K/(Ca + Mg) was much higher, and the Ca/P ratio was much lower, than those values reported {{to be associated with the}} occurrence of <b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> in grazing cattle. Very high nitrogen concentratians in early summer (up to 5. 2 % N where 672 kg N ha- 1 year- 1 was applied) were in the range that has been associated with <b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> in cattle. Lime application increased the nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium concentrations in the herbage throughout the year. The effect of lime in increasing nitrogen concentration in the herbage was maximal in late autumn and winter, at which time fertilizer nitrogen had little or no effect. The increased nitrogen concentration in the herbage through application of lime was associated with the development of a naturalized white clover component in the sward. Lime also increased the phosphorus concentration in the herbage, particularly from mid-winter to early summer, over which period phosphorus application per se had minimal effect. The application of lime allied with 134 kg N ha- 1 year- 1 maintained a high level of dry matter production as well as a more adequate and better balanced nutrient content in the kikuyu pasture throughout the year, and particularly in winter, when cattle grazing kikuyu pastures suffer a serious feed gap...|$|E
40|$|Integration {{of crops}} and {{livestock}} has been revitalised in Australia, initially {{as an opportunity to}} increase cropping within the high-rainfall grazing zones, and more recently, to improve enterprise diversification and profitability across the low-, medium- and high-rainfall, and mixed-farming zones. Young crops are highly digestible (> 80 % dry matter digestibility, DMD) with a high energy density (> 12 MJ/kg DM) and, in much of southern Australia, fill a winter feed gap. The quality and time of feed availability also coincide with the high nutrient requirements of ewes in late pregnancy and lactation. In Western Australia and South Australia, young crops are available for lactating ewes and young growing lambs (autumn lambing). For the smaller proportion of growers who lamb later in winter, young crops are available for the last 1 - 2 months of pregnancy. In the later-lambing states of New South Wales and Victoria, crops may be grazed by ewes at any stage of pregnancy and lactation and/or by young lambs. In Tasmania, crops {{are more likely to be}} available during early-mid-gestation. Limited studies on feed budgeting with grazing crops have indicated that ewes can maintain or even increase liveweight, with a much lower level of feed on offer than would be required with traditional pastures (2. 2, indicating a high risk of <b>grass</b> <b>tetany.</b> The elevated potassium also contributes to a high dietary cation-anion difference of approximately + 49 mEq/ 100 g DM and this may cause metabolic alkalosis and hypocalcaemia. Pregnancy toxaemia, hypocalcaemia and <b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> are all potential causes of increased ewe mortality. Pregnancy and/or lactation outcomes will also be influenced by a deficiency of trace elements. Grazing young crops in areas with a history of selenium, copper, iodine and cobalt deficiency will increase susceptibility to deficiency by increasing growth and feed intake. In conclusion, the grazing of young growing crops presents new opportunities for increased production and stocking rates in the mixed-farming zones. The value of this feed source is well recognised by some producers. While growing crops have a highly productive potential, they also come with an increased risk of a range metabolic disturbances and nutritional imbalances. These risks can be minimised by regular monitoring of livestock and crop biomass and the provision of mineral supplements...|$|E
40|$|Cycling of {{potassium}} in grassland systems has received relatively little attention {{in research and}} practice in recent years. Balanced nutrient systems require consideration of nutrients other than nitrogen (N). Potassium (K) is needed in large amounts and {{is closely related to}} N nutrition. In intensive dairy farming, surpluses of K arise from the input of concentrates and fertilizer and are returned to the grassland and may lead to increasing K content in the soil. Organic farming, on the other hand, is characterized by limitations in input of nutrient sources and quantities. Leaching of K from grassland is usually low, but high levels of available soil K, high K input from fertilizer or at urine patches lead to increasing losses. High K inputs have a negative influence on Mg and Ca uptake by plants and can cause accelerated leaching of these cations. High levels of K have been associated with inducing nutrition-related dairy cow health problems such as milk fever (hypocalcaemia) and <b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> (hypoinagnesaemia).

Three types of isolates {{were obtained from the}} plates (a crescent-shaped organism, a pleomorphic rod, and a spiral-shaped organism), and all three produced tricarballylate in batch cultures that contained glucose and trans-aconitate. In glucose-limited chemostats (0. 10 h− 1), trans-aconitate reduction was associated with a decrease in the amount of reduced products formed from glucose. The crescent-shaped organism produced less propionate, the pleomorphic rod produced less ethanol, and the spiral made less succinate and possibly H 2. Aconitate reduction by the pleomorphic rod and the spiral organism was associated with a significant increase in cellular dry matter. Experiments with stock cultures of predominant rumen bacteria indicated that Selenomonas ruminantium, a species taxonomically similar to the crescent-shaped isolate, was an active reducer of trans-aconitate. Strains of Bacteroides ruminicola, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and Megasphaera elsdenii produced little if any tricarballylate. Wolinella succinogenes produced some tricarballylate.

These results were discussed from the aspect of mineral requirements for animals. The actual differences between dicotyledons and grasses varied greatly, however. The effects of herbs and clovers on the incidence of <b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> was often small or absent. This was explained by the observation that the preference K>Na>Mg>Ca was normally greater with cation intake by grasses than by dicotyledons.

40|$|Tricarballylate is the causative {{agent of}} <b>grass</b> <b>tetany,</b> a {{ruminant}} disease characterized by acute magnesium deficiency. Tricarballylate toxicity has {{been attributed to}} its ability to chelate magnesium and to inhibit aconitase, a Krebs cycle enzyme. Neither the ruminant nor the normal rumen flora can catabolize tricarballylate to ameliorate its toxic effects. However, the gram-negative enterobacterium Salmonella enterica can use tricarballylate as a carbon and energy source, providing an opportunity to study the genes and enzymes required for tricarballylate catabolism. The tricarballylate utilization (tcu) genes are organized into two transcriptional units, i. e., tcuR and tcuABC. Here, we report the initial biochemical analysis of TcuA. TcuA catalyzed the oxidation of tricarballylate to cis-aconitate.

Rainey, G. Chen, E. Stackebrandt, and J. B. Russell, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 44 : 576 - 578, 1994). The trans-aconitate-oxidizing bacterium {{was identified as}} Acidaminococcus fermentans, and it converted trans-aconitate to acetate, a nontoxic end product of ruminal fermentation. When S. ruminantium and A. fermentans were cocultured with trans-aconitate and glucose, tricarballylate never accumulated and all the trans-aconitate was converted to acetate. Continuous-culture studies (dilution rate, 0. 1 h- 1) likewise indicated that A. fermentans could outcompete S. ruminantium for trans-aconitate. When mixed ruminal bacteria were incubated in vitro with 10 mM trans-aconitate for 24 h, 45 % of the trans-aconitate was converted to tricarballylate.

When A. fermentans (2 g of bacterial protein) was added directly to the rumen, the subsequent conversion of trans-aconitate to tricarballylate decreased 50 %, but this effect did not persist for more than 18 h.

40|$|Para estudiar el efecto de la suplementación con Mg en rebaños de carne hipomagnesémicos, sobre las concentraciones sanguíneas y urinarias de Mg y la prevención de la tetania hipomagnesémica, se realizaron 4 ensayos en rebaños Hereford (vacas pre y postparto) con casos clínicos y muertes por tetania hipomagnesémica e hipomagnesemia diagnosticada mediante un perfil metabólico. En el ensayo 1 se utilizaron 50 g/d/vaca de MgO (equivalente a 25 g de Mg) sobre ensilaje o heno por 44 días; en el ensayo 2 se uso el MgO + NaCl en mezcla con avena chancada (equivalente a 25 g de Mg) por 55 días. En el ensayo 3 se utilizó MgSO 4 al 0. 5 % en el agua de bebida, durante 44 días, equivalente a 10 g/d de Mg. En el ensayo 4 se utilizó MgSO 4 en el último mes de gestación y MgO después del parto, en iguales dosis a las señaladas para los otros ensayos, durante 55 días. En 10 vacas de cada ensayo se obtuvieron muestras de sangre y orina previo a la suplementación, durante la suplementación (cada 11 &plusmn; 2 días) y 1 semana después de finalizada. En las muestras se determinaron las concentraciones de Mg sérico (Mg-s), Mg urinario (Mg-u) y Mg-u corregido por creatinina (CUM). Las concentraciones de Mg-s sólo en el ensayo 3 aumentaron significativamente (p The {{effects of}} supplementation with {{magnesium}} (Mg) salts on blood and urine Mg concentrations and {{the prevention of}} <b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> in hypomagnesaemic beef herds were examined. Two systems of supplementation were tested in 4 beef herds at grazing, between July and December 1993. The herds {{had an average of}} 100 cows and were between 7 months pregnant and 2 months after calving. The herds presented clinical cases of <b>grass</b> <b>tetany,</b> dead animals and hypomagnesaemia diagnosed by metabolic profile test. In two herds the cows were supplemented with MgO, (50 g/d/cow, mixed with silage, hay or grounded oats) for 44 to 55 days. In one trial the cows were supplemented with MgSO 4 (0. 5 % in the drinking water) for 44 days. In the last herd the cows were supplemented with MgSO 4 before calving and with MgO after calving in a similar way to the previous trials. Blood and urine samples were collected from 10 cows in each herd, starting 1 day before supplementation, and every 11 &plusmn; 2 days during the supplementation period and for one week after. The concentrations of serum magnesium (Mg-s), urinary magnesium (Mg-u) and creatinine corrected urinary magnesium (CUM) were determined in the samples. Of the two herds supplemented with MgO, only one presented a significant increase of Mg-s (p< 0. 05) during the supplementation period, reaching values of 0. 71 - 0. 78 mmol/l; whereas the Mg-u concentration of the same herd presented a significative increase (p< 0. 05), with values above the reference of < 1. 5 mmol/l. The herd supplemented with MgSO 4 showed a significant increase of Mg-s (p< 0. 05) but the Mg-u did not increases during the supplementation period. In the last trial the Mg-s and Mg-u did not show any significant variation (p< 0. 05). The CUM presented a significant increase (p< 0. 05) in all the trials, but the values remained below the minimal reference value of 1 mmol/l. The proportion of animals with clinical hypomagnesaemic tetany decreased from 1. 9 % during the two months before supplementation to 0. 3 % and the mortality decreased from 1. 2 % to 0 % in the same period. According to these results, in beef cows with hypomagnesaemia, supplementation with MgO given in food or MgSO 4 in the drinking water is effective in maintaining or increasing the concentrations of Mg-s, Mg-u and CUM, and in reducing the incidence of clinical cases and deaths produced by grass tetan...|$|E
40|$|The sandhill {{transition}} area of Nebraska represents a vast potential reservoir {{for food and}} fiber production. The soils of this area are lower in natural fertility {{than many of the}} finer-textured soils of the state. Properties of these soils are vastly different from others having a history of intense cultivation. In addition many of these soils are being developed for irrigation. The question becomes what kinds and quantities of fertilizers are required to bring these soils into profitable crop production. These soils test among the lowest in the state in exchangeable magnesium and potassium. However, will these soils support the intense demands of crops such as irrigated corn or pasture, including bromegrass and orchardgrass? If potassium fertilizer is used on these soils will the natural soil magnesium level be adequate for high yields? With the recent increased interest in irrigated pastures, new demands are being placed on these coarse-textured soils. Feeding forage produced on these soils may introduce a new consideration in the proper fertilizer program. A condition in ruminants known as “grass tetany” has been correlated with low magnesium content of forage. Conceivably this may be a concern if irrigated pastures are grown on these relatively low magnesium soils. If the depression of magnesium uptake in crops occurs in this soil, potassium fertilizer recommendations may need to be tempered accordingly. With these question becoming more pressing, the potassium-magnesium study was undertaken with the following objectives. Determine the influence of soil potassium saturation on growth and magnesium uptake by corn. Determine to what degree magnesium uptake is influenced by potassium saturation in terms of concentration and dry matter production. Determine the likelihood of reducing magnesium levels with potassium fertilizer applications to levels associated with <b>grass</b> <b>tetany.</b> Determine the influence of various potassium and magnesium levels in the soil on the uptake of other nutrients. Determine the feasibility of studying the above objectives in a field experiment on the soil studied in the greenhouse. Advisor: Delno Knudse...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{evaluate}} mathematical models that predict mineral excretion, particularly calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and selenium (Se), from lactating dairy cows. Mineral excretion can be affected by several dietary factors. A deficiency in Ca or Mg application to pasture, among other factors, can contribute to <b>grass</b> <b>tetany</b> or wheat pasture poisoning in cows, whereas an excess can cause runoff into water supplies. Manure application with high Se concentration can also result in runoff, causing the bioaccumulation of selenium in aquatic ecosystems, wetland habitats and estuaries, leading to toxic levels in fish. A database composed of studies relating to mineral utilisation in lactating dairy cows conducted after and including the year 2000 was compiled. A meta-analysis was conducted with the aim of creating multiple empirical equations to predict Ca, Mg and Se excretion from lactating dairy cows. Calcium intake, feed Ca content, milk yield, milk protein content and acid detergent fibre content in diet were positively and linearly related to Ca excretion. Dietary crude protein content and milk fat content were negatively related to Ca excretion. Magnesium intake, feed Mg content and milk yield were positively and linearly related to Mg excretion. Selenium content of diet and dry matter intake were linearly and positively related to Se excretion. Two sets of models were developed using or excluding the intake variable and both sets of models were evaluated with independent data originating from commercial herd or individual animals. In general, intake measurements improved prediction when evaluated with independent datasets (root mean square prediction error = 8 % to 19 % vs 14 % to 26 % of the average observed value). There were substantial mean biases, particularly those evaluated with data from a commercial farm, perhaps due to inaccurate feed intake measurements. Although there was generally good agreement between predicted and observed mineral excretion, model development and evaluation would benefit from an expanded database...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to better understand}} plant characteristics related to high and low forage yield in tall fescue selections as affected by temperature. Dry matter distribution into yield components in three different temperature regimes was evaluated. Root growth, dark respiration and nutrient concentration were also examined. The four diverse tall fescue selections grown under controlled environmental conditions exhibited yields similar to those noted in the field. Selection TFM 26 produced more forage yield at the low temperature while TFK 12 produced more at the high temperature indicating a seasonal growth response. However, TFM 26 was the highest yielding selection when averaged over the three temperature regimes. High yielding TFM 26 had the greatest leaf area and low yielding TFK 4 the least. Higher yielding TFM 26 and TFK 12 had more leaf area per tiller than the other selections and TFM 26 had {{the greatest number of}} tillers. Root volume had a closer association with forage yield than root dry matter (RDM). Winter-growing TFMs had greater RDM than the summer-growing TFKs. Root density was higher for winter-growing TFM 16 which appeared to be partitioning more root dry matter into root 'bulk' than root volume. Winter-growing TFMs had higher root-to- shoot ratios than TFKs suggesting that winter-growing selections distribute their dry matter differently. Growth analysis showed that relative growth rates were higher for high yielding selections. High yielding selections also had a higher relative leaf area growth rate (RLAGR). A rapid leaf area development may be producing more available photosynthate at an earlier growth stage giving high yielding selections their yield advantage. The relative root growth rate (RRGR) was greater for winter-growing TFMs than for TFKs. The high RRGR of TRM 26 may be related to its high RLAGR. The harvest index was higher for summer-growing TFKs than winter-growing TFMs. Dark respiration rates in roots and leaves did not differ throughout the experiment. Mineral analysis showed that K accumulation per unit of root volume was greater for winter-growing TFM 16 than TFM 26, however, TFM 26 had greater K per gram of root material. The data suggest that winter-growing TFM 16 may absorb and translocate more K than TFM 26. Summer-growing TFK 12 had low Mg at the low temperatures suggesting that animal consumption may induce a Mg deficiency (<b>grass</b> <b>tetany)</b> when grazed during low temperatures...|$|E
