5|$|In the {{clinical}} sense, a disorder {{is a condition}} requiring treatment as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. There {{is a lack of}} consensus about the precise meaning of the term 'attachment disorder' although there is general agreement that such disorders only arise following early adverse caregiving experiences. Reactive attachment disorder indicates the absence of either or both the main aspects of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure. This can occur either <b>in</b> <b>institutions,</b> or with repeated changes of caregiver, or from extremely neglectful primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs after the age of 6 months. Current official classifications of RAD under DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 are largely based on this {{understanding of the nature of}} attachment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to propose professional development strategies for administrators <b>in</b> education <b>institutions</b> under the Office of the Basic Education Commission. A descriptive research method was used in this study. The research procedure included 4 stages: (1) A study of professionalization of administrators <b>in</b> education <b>institutions</b> by documentary analysis and interviewing 3 experts <b>in</b> educational <b>institution</b> administration, (2) A survey {{of the state of the}} professionalization of administrators <b>in</b> education <b>institutions</b> from 325 administrators through a questionnaire, (3) Formulating professional development strategies for administrators <b>in</b> education <b>institutions,</b> and (4) Evaluating the appropriateness and feasibility of the strategies by 11 experts. The research results were as follows: 1) the professionalization of administrators <b>in</b> education <b>institutions</b> composed of 4 major aspects, They were characteristics, competencies, academic leadership, and performance. The major aspects composed of 24 minor aspects. 2) The administrators <b>in</b> education <b>institutions</b> evaluated the significance/necessity and the practice of the professionalization of administrators <b>in</b> education <b>institutions</b> at the highest level, and high level accordingly in all aspects. 3) The strategies of professional development for administrators <b>in</b> education <b>institutions</b> composed of 3 strategies: the proclamation of national agenda on professional development for administrators <b>in</b> education <b>institutions,</b> the development of academic leadership for student development, and the reflection of professional development from the performance...|$|R
5|$|Studies of {{children}} who were reared <b>in</b> <b>institutions</b> have suggested that they are inattentive and overactive, no matter what quality of care they received. In one investigation, some institution-reared boys were reported to be inattentive, overactive, and markedly unselective in their social relationships, while girls, foster-reared children, and some institution-reared children were not. It {{is not yet clear}} whether these behaviors should be considered as part of disordered attachment.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of allowing parents frequent visiting to hospitalised children became the norm {{and there was}} a move towards placing homeless children with foster carers, rather than <b>in</b> <b>institutions,</b> and a move towards the professionalisation of alternative carers. In hospitals, the change was given added impetus by the work of social worker and psychoanalyst James Robertson who filmed the distressing effects of separation on children in hospital and collaborated with Bowlby in making the 1952 documentary film A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{profound}} differences with psychoanalytic ideas, the theoretical basis of Bowlby's monograph was controversial {{in a number}} of ways. Some profoundly disagreed with the necessity for maternal (or equivalent) love in order to function normally, or that the formation of an ongoing relationship with a child was an important part of parenting. The idea that early experiences have serious consequences for intellectual and psychosocial development was controversial in itself. Others questioned the extent to which his hypothesis was supported by the evidence. There was criticism of the confusion of the effects of privation (no primary attachment figure) and deprivation (loss of the primary attachment figure) and in particular, of the failure to distinguish between the effects of the lack of a primary attachment figure and the other forms of deprivation and understimulation that might affect children <b>in</b> <b>institutions.</b>|$|E

40|$|The globalizations {{of capital}} {{markets in the}} last 20 years {{has led to a}} {{historic}} degree of financial integration in the world. It is clear, however, that globalization is not conducive to a complete homogeneity of financial markets and institutions. Among others, one element of diversity is the importance of the impact of corruption in emerging countries. Corruption decreases the credibility of financial institutions and markets. Scandals and unethical behavior <b>in</b> financial <b>institutions</b> erode confidence <b>in</b> such firms. Relying on neoinstitutional literature, this article focuses on the link between corruption and organizational isomorphism <b>in</b> financial <b>institutions</b> <b>in</b> emerging countries. Therefore, our aim is to examine the institutional reasons for corruption <b>in</b> financial <b>institutions</b> <b>in</b> emerging countries.

5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that children <b>in</b> <b>institutions</b> like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.|$|E

The nomenklatura members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres of public life, for example economic development, industry management or education. For the party, the privileged nomenklatura layer was maintained to assure the proper placement {{of people who were}} ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the revisionist dissidents Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political bureaucracy for its own sake. The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted nomenklatura and the security services were resented.|$|E
