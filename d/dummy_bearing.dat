50|$|On {{the island}} of Okinawa, where Sheng Long lives, the great martial arts warrior is being nursed back to health by Nida, a street fighter from the Philippines who came to Okinawa to learn the ways of Shotokan karate, Sheng Long’s {{fighting}} style. Sheng Long is surprised that his pupils Ryu and Ken haven’t come to visit him, but Nida tells him of a new street fighter tournament that is approaching and believes {{that they might be}} training for it. Sheng Long promises Nida to teach him Shotokan karate once he recovers, but she fears that he may never be able to overcome the deadly poison in his body. After leaving Sheng Long to rest, Nida goes into another room to train, and smashes a <b>dummy</b> <b>bearing</b> a photo of Ryu, vowing that once he defeats Ken’s killer to restore their master’s honor, he will have to face her next.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel test rig, developed to analyse the behaviour of rolling element bearings subjected to highly varying loads. The design is optimised {{to measure the}} bearing behaviour, free from dynamics of the surrounding structure. In the current study, the test rig is {{used to evaluate the}} stiffness of a deep groove ball bearing under different operational conditions. The bearing behaviour is measured using the modal analysis technique. Then, an analytical model of the test structure is fitted on the data to estimate the bearing stiffness. The stiffness estimation is validated using a <b>dummy</b> <b>bearing</b> with a known stiffness. Finally, the stiffness of a mounted ball bearing is estimated. The paper evaluates the effect of a radial static load on the bearing stiffness. Stationary and operational conditions are compared as well. A clear difference between the stiffness of a rotating and non-rotating bearing is observed. status: publishe...|$|E
50|$|In {{full dress}} the coatee's chest, back, tails back and front, collar, cuffs and pocket flaps were all {{decorated}} with gold oak-leaf embroidery. It was fastened by hooks and eyes, with <b>dummy</b> buttons <b>bearing</b> the Royal {{coat of arms}} of the United Kingdom (nine buttons up the front, showing between the two embroidered edges two at the waist behind, two {{at the bottom of}} back skirts). The coatee had white silk linings, and was worn with white breeches, white gloves, and patent leather court shoes with gilt buckles. The sword had black scabbard, gilt mountings, and sword knot of gold lace strap with bullion tassel; it was worn on a sword belt of white web, with white cloth frog.|$|R
