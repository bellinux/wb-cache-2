25|$|Most {{states have}} {{modified}} {{the general rule}} that employment is at will by holding that employees may, under that state's common law, have <b>implied</b> <b>contract</b> rights to fair treatment by their employers.

25|$|Where an {{individual}} is contracted to perform certain duties, a {{failure to do so}} may result in criminal liability. The principle of liability arising from a mutual agreement arose from the decision of R v Instan, where a woman was found guilty of manslaughter, after failing to summon medical attention for her aunt, who maintained them both. The decisions of the court suggest that an <b>implied</b> <b>contract</b> of mutual benefit existed, so as to imply a duty upon the defendant to act. As demonstrated by 'R v Pittwood (1902), where a gatekeeper was found criminally liable for failing to perform his duties correctly, this principle may be extended to instances where the injured individual is a third party.|$|E

50|$|<b>Contracts</b> <b>implied</b> in law {{differ from}} <b>contracts</b> <b>implied</b> {{in fact in}} that <b>contracts</b> <b>implied</b> in law are not true <b>contracts.</b> <b>Contracts</b> <b>implied</b> in fact are ones that the parties {{involved}} presumably intended. In <b>contracts</b> <b>implied</b> in law, one party may have been completely unwilling to participate, as shown below, especially for an action in restitution. There has been no mutual assent, in other words, but public policy essentially requires a remedy.|$|R

25|$|In certain circumstances, an <b>implied</b> <b>{{contract}}</b> may be created. A {{contract is}} implied in fact if the circumstances imply that parties have {{reached an agreement}} {{even though they have}} not done so expressly. For example, John Smith, a former lawyer may implicitly enter a contract by visiting a doctor and being examined; if the patient refuses to pay after being examined, the patient has breached a contract implied in fact. A contract which is implied in law is also called a quasi-contract, because it is not in fact a contract; rather, it is a means for the courts to remedy situations in which one party would be unjustly enriched were he or she not required to compensate the other. Quantum meruit claims are an example.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, a local {{government}} may only {{enter into a}} contract that is within the scope of its charter. A contract to do something beyond its power is void and unenforceable, and in fact the {{local government}} will be prohibited from performing its obligations under such a contract. The private party who performs under such a contract will have no means of recovery, even under equitable theories such as equitable estoppel, <b>implied</b> <b>contract,</b> quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment. This limitation also applies where the subject of the contract is permissible under the charter, but {{the manner in which the}} contract is made or awarded violates proscriptions set forth in the charter. For example, if the charter requires that contracts for provision of a public service be awarded to the lowest bidder in an open bidding process, and such a process is not used to award the contract, then the contract itself is void and the private party to the contract will have no recourse to enforce the local government's obligations thereunder.|$|E
2500|$|Under the <b>implied</b> <b>contract</b> exception, an {{employer}} may not fire an employee [...] "when an <b>implied</b> <b>contract</b> is formed between {{an employer}} and employee, {{even though no}} express, written instrument regarding the employment relationship exists." [...] Proving the terms of an <b>implied</b> <b>contract</b> is often difficult, and {{the burden of proof}} is on the fired employee. Implied employment contracts are most often found when an employer's personnel policies or handbooks indicate that an employee will not be fired except for good cause or specify a process for firing. If the employer fires the employee in violation of an implied employment contract, the employer may be found liable for breach of contract.|$|E

5000|$|The Bills of Lading Act 1855 was commendably {{brief and}} proved useful, {{but as time}} went by certain defects became apparent.

2500|$|However, a 2000 {{paper by}} Thomas Miles found no effect upon {{aggregate}} employment {{but found that}} adopting the <b>implied</b> <b>contract</b> exception causes use of temporary employment to rise as much as 15%. [...] Later work by David Autor in the mid-2000s identified multiple flaws in Miles' methodology, found that the <b>implied</b> <b>contract</b> exception decreased aggregate employment 0.8 to 1.6%, and confirmed the outsourcing phenomenon identified by Miles, but {{also found that the}} tort exceptions to at-will had no statistically significant influence. [...] Autor and colleagues later found in 2007 that the good faith exception does reduce job flows, and seems to cause labor productivity to rise but total factor productivity to drop. [...] In other words, employers forced to find a [...] "good faith" [...] reason to fire an employee tend to automate operations to avoid hiring new employees, but also suffer an impact on total productivity because of the increased difficulty in discharging unproductive employees. [...] Other researchers have found that at-will exceptions {{have a negative effect on}} reemployment of unemployed (but not already employed) workers, and that hedonic regressions on at-will exceptions show large negative effects on individual welfare with regard to home values, rents, and wages. Verkerke also explains that several international comparative studies have found that [...] "job security has a large negative effect on employment rates." ...|$|E

60|$|Some {{thousands}} of years of such experience have led to the generalisations, that stealing and murder, for example, are inconsistent with the ends of society. There is no more doubt that they are so than that unsupported stones tend to fall. The man who steals or murders, breaks his <b>implied</b> <b>contract</b> with society, and forfeits all protection. He becomes an outlaw, to be dealt with as any other feral creature. Criminal law indicates the ways which have proved most convenient for dealing with him.|$|E
50|$|The terms {{quasi-contract}} and <b>contract</b> <b>implied</b> in law are synonymous. There are {{two types}} of quasi-contract. One is an action in restitution. The other is unjust enrichment. Note, therefore, that it is improper to say that quasi-contract, <b>implied</b> in law <b>contract,</b> and unjust enrichment are all synonymous, because unjust enrichment is only one type of the broader category of quasi-contracts (<b>contracts</b> <b>implied</b> in law).|$|R

60|$|There is an <b>implied</b> <b>contract,</b> much {{stronger}} than any instrument or article of agreement between the laborer in any occupation and his employer,--that the labor, so far as that labor is concerned, shall be sufficient to pay to the employer a profit on his capital and a compensation for his risk: in a word, that the labor shall produce an advantage equal to the payment.

60|$|The news {{spread quickly}} and far. It overtook several {{wandering}} Californians in Europe, {{and sent them}} to their bankers with anxious faces; it paled the cheeks of one or two guardians of orphan children, frightened several widows, drove a confidential clerk into shameful exile, and struck Mr. Raynor in Boston with such consternation, that people for the first time suspected that he had backed his opinion of the resources of California with capital. Throughout the length and breadth of the Pacific slope it produced a movement of aggression which the earthquake had hitherto failed to cover. The probabilities of danger to life and limb by a recurrence of the shock had been dismissed from the public consideration, but this actual loss of characteristic property awakened the gravest anxiety. If Nature claimed the privilege of at any time withdrawing from that <b>implied</b> <b>contract</b> under which so many of California's best citizens had occupied and improved the country, it was high time that something should be done.

60|$|I was now {{far from}} my native place, {{but had not}} yet stepped before the public. A slight tremor seized me {{whenever}} I thought of relinquishing the immunities of a private character, and giving every man, and for money too, the right which no man yet possessed, of treating me with open scorn. But {{about a week after}} contracting the above alliance I made my bow to an audience of nine persons, seven of whom hissed me in a very disagreeable manner, and not without good cause. Indeed, the failure was so signal {{that it would have been}} mere swindling to retain the money, which had been paid on my <b>implied</b> <b>contract</b> to give its value of amusement. So I called in the doorkeeper, bade him refund the whole receipts, a mighty sum and was gratified with a round of applause by way of offset to the hisses. This event would have looked most horrible in anticipation,--a thing to make a man shoot himself, or run amuck, or hide himself in caverns where he might not see his own burning blush; but the reality was not so very hard to bear. It is a fact that I was more deeply grieved by an almost parallel misfortune which happened to my companion on the same evening. In my own behalf I was angry and excited, not depressed; my blood ran quick, my spirits rose buoyantly, and I had never felt such a confidence of future success and determination to achieve it as at that trying moment. I resolved to persevere, if it were only to wring the reluctant praise from my enemies.|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{on the role of}} {{religious}} conflict between parents in determining child custody and visitation disputes. It suggests a framework for reconciling parental control over religious observance and training with the state 2 Ì† 7 s duty to protect the child 2 Ì† 7 s best interests. First, it examines the history of English and American child custody law and analyzes modern custody cases in which religion is a factor. Next, it addresses the alarming recent attempt by courts to resolve religious disputes with a shared custody approach, awarding 2 Ì† 7 spiritual custody 2 Ì† 7 to one parent and 2 Ì† 7 physical custody 2 Ì† 7 to the other. Finally, this article proposes a contractual approach to the question of religion in parental child custody and visitation disputes. Since religion is a legitimate issue to be considered in fashioning child custody decisions, courts should be required to consider the religious needs of the child, as a component of the child 2 Ì† 7 s educational and psychological well-being. However, constitutional issues need not be reached. Indeed, it is likely that courts can avoid most troublesome constitutional issues by enforcing the express and <b>implied</b> <b>contracts</b> created by the parties before their divorce. Ultimately, the approach suggested here most effectively protects the actual religious needs of parents and children by enforcing the express and <b>implied</b> <b>contracts</b> created in the intact, pre-divorce family...|$|R
