5|$|Back on the ward, {{a father}} and his two daughters have been brought in, one with a stab wound and one badly burnt. The father only has minor {{injuries}} but the police seem to believe <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> {{to do with the}} incident. Maddy tries to find out what is happening from the father, who is not talking to the police. She seems to have some connection with him but can't seem to put her finger on what it is.|$|E
25|$|When police {{knocked on}} Einem's door and enquired {{about whether they}} could ask him a few questions, his {{immediate}} reaction was {{to say that he}} wouldn't answer anything without speaking to his lawyer first. This made police suspect that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to hide.|$|E
25|$|He {{also served}} in World War II {{commanding}} the 3rd Battle Squadron from 1940 and the 18th Cruiser Squadron from 1942. It {{is said that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> of a reputation of being a Jonah in any cruiser in which he raised his Admiral's flag, as these kept being sunk from under his feet. He was made Flag Officer, Malta in 1942 and retired due to ill health in 1943 although he was recalled in 1944 to lead Naval Convoys.|$|E

25|$|Politically, however, Giolitti did {{not survive}} the scandal. He had been Finance Minister in the {{government}} that had suppressed the original 1889 report. As Prime Minister he had borrowed from the Banca Romana for governmental purposes in August 1892, had nominated the bank's governor, Tanlongo, to the Senate, and had resisted a parliamentary enquiry, encouraging suspicions that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to hide. Tanlongo and the Banca Romana's tried to defame Giolitti, calculating that a change of government {{would result in the}} release of the defendants.|$|E
500|$|The {{audience}} reacted immediately; Charles {{could feel}} the room shaking and bouncing as the crowd was dancing. Many audience members approached Charles {{at the end of}} the show to ask where they could purchase the record. Charles and the orchestra performed it again several nights in a row with the same reaction at each show. He called Jerry Wexler to say <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> new to record, later writing, [...] "I don't believe in giving myself advance notices, but I figured this song merited it".|$|E
500|$|The {{families}} living in Duxbury (sometimes [...] "Duxborough") {{asked to be}} set off from Plymouth as a separate town with their own church and minister; this request was granted in 1637. [...] Historian Justin Winsor and others have insisted that the name of Duxbury was given by Standish in honor of Duxbury Hall, near Chorley in Lancashire, which was owned by {{a branch of the}} Standish family. [...] The coincidence would suggest that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to do with it, though no records exist to indicate how the town was named.|$|E

500|$|Rogan recounted to The Irish Times {{the value}} he {{obtained}} from interviews with Morrison's first wife, {{as well as}} his partner in a later relationship, Michelle Rocca. [...] "Here was a man who had explored all these mystic religions, had undergone Gestalt therapy, who had been told by a Rosacrucian master that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> called an 'Angelic Knot', suddenly hanging around fashionable nightclubs and being written about in gossip columns. The relationship with Michelle Rocca certainly helped, in that I got more out of one single interview done by Michelle Rocca than I did, in entirety, from his first wife, Janet Planet," [...] said Rogan.|$|E
500|$|Through high school, he was bullied for his shyness {{and unusual}} speech patterns. According to Chris Davids, {{a high school}} classmate in Cho's English class at Westfield High School, Cho looked down and refused to speak when called upon. Davids added that, after one teacher {{threatened}} to give Cho a failing grade for not participating in class, he began reading in a strange, deep voice that sounded [...] "like <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> in his mouth. [...] " [...] While several students recalled instances of Cho being bullied and mocked at Westfield, most left him alone and later {{said they were not}} aware of his anger. Cho graduated from Westfield High School in 2003.|$|E
500|$|He {{was sentenced}} to life on June 27, 1930, on the old murder charge. He {{remained}} silent during the trial. Cascioferro had been arrested some 69 times before and always had been acquitted, but this time it was different. After hearing the sentence the president of the court asked Cascioferro if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to say in his defense. Cascioferro stood up and said: [...] "Gentlemen, as you have been unable to obtain proof of any of the numerous crimes I have committed, you have been reduced to condemning me for the only one I never committed." [...] The [...] "iron prefect", as Mori was known, wanted to give maximum publicity to the event. He had posters printed with pictures of Cascioferro and the text of the court sentence.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} made {{available}} for download on April 20, 2005, the sixth anniversary of the Columbine massacre. Ledonne sought to remain anonymous at the game's debut to avoid any possible controversy, which he would later regret as it created the impression <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to hide. Under the alias [...] "Columbin", Ledonne regularly engaged gamers and critics alike on a message board he established to discuss the game's depiction of the shooting and the broader implications of the shooting. Ledonne's identity was revealed by Roger Kovacs, a friend {{of one of the}} Columbine victims, Rachel Scott. Kovacs found out Ledonne's name by donating to the site via Paypal; after his name and address were posted online, Ledonne stepped forward and was greeted with requests for interviews. [...] "That's when I decided that I had to grow a backbone and stand up for my creation," [...] Ledonne said.|$|E
500|$|The Season Two DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Jim doing impressions of Kevin and Angela for Pam, Dwight noting that he is so determined to find the culprit that {{he is prepared to}} pray [...] "to Thor himself", Toby saying that he does not think Michael is taking drugs, Jim secretly doing an impression of Dwight right in front of him, Dwight talking about Jim and concluding that, [...] "If that were my life, I'd do drugs", Pam toying with Dwight by admitting that she [...] "was a teensy bit high... in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy", Meredith coming to Jim because Pam told her <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to tell her. Jim is under the jinx and says nothing, Kelly putting a customer on hold when she is called by Dwight and forgetting to return, Dwight taking notes during the conference, Pam showing the camera the flyer that Michael made up for the conference, and Lee and Gino, the workers at Vance Refrigeration, discarding a joint in the parking lot.|$|E
500|$|Contrecœur {{prepared}} {{an official}} {{report of the}} action {{that was based on}} two sources. [...] Most of it came from a Canadien named Monceau who escaped the action but apparently did not witness Jumonville's slaying: [...] " [...] saw themselves surrounded by the English {{on one side and the}} Indians on the Other. [...] The English gave them two volleys, but the Indians did not fire. [...] Mr. de Jumonville, by his interpreter, told them to desist, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to tell them. [...] Upon which they ceased firing. [...] Then Mr. de Jumonville ordered the Summons which I had sent them to retire, to be read ... Monceau saw all our Frenchmen coming up close to Mr. de Jumonville, whilst they were reading the Summons ... during which Time, said Monceau made the best of his Way to us". [...] Contrecœur's second source was an Indian from Tanacharison's camp, who reported that [...] "Mr. de Jumonville was killed by a Musket-Shot in the Head, whilst they were reading the Summons". The same Indian claimed that the Indians then rushed in to prevent the British from slaughtering the Frenchmen.|$|E

500|$|According to Burks, Hubbard [...] "was so sure <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> 'away out and beyond' {{anything}} else that he had sent telegrams to several book publishers, telling them that he had written 'THE book' {{and that they were}} to meet him at Penn Station, and he would discuss it with them and go with whomever gave him the best offer." [...] However, nobody bought the manuscript. Forrest J Ackerman, later Hubbard's literary agent, recalled that Hubbard told him [...] "whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide. And he said that {{the last time he had}} shown it to a publisher in New York, he walked into the office to find out what the reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript, threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window." [...] Hubbard's failure to sell Excalibur depressed him; he told his wife in an October 1938 letter: [...] "Writing action pulp doesn't have much agreement with what I want to do because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and, further, actually weakens my name. So you see I've got to do something about it and at the same time strengthen the old financial position." [...] He went on: ...|$|E
500|$|To avert {{a republican}} backlash, Ouro Preto {{exploited}} the ready credit available to Brazil {{as a result}} of its prosperity. He made available massive loans at favorable interest rates to plantation owners and lavishly granted titles and lesser honors to curry favor with influential political figures who had become disaffected. He also indirectly began to address the problem of the recalcitrant military by revitalizing the moribund National Guard, by then an entity which existed mostly only on paper. As the Count of Nioac, a noted politician, remarked: [...] "I call your attention especially to the reorganization of the National Guard, in order to possess this force with which in past times the government suppressed military revolts. If we had had the National Guard reorganized, the Deodoros and other ignorant military men would have been quiet." [...] Pedro II also asked Salvador Mendonça, who was leaving to the U.S. to represent Brazil at the First International Conference of American States, to carefully study the U.S. Supreme Court with the goal of creating a similar tribunal in Brazil and transferring his constitutional prerogatives to it. This would have made the monarch a mere figurehead. It is not known if he intended to constrain his daughter's powers as empress and make her thus more palatable to the politicians, or whether <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> else in mind.|$|E
2500|$|Laughton {{has been}} seen by one actor {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} performers of his generation. Daniel Day-Lewis cited him as one of his inspirations, saying: [...] "He was probably the greatest film actor who came from that period of time. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> quite remarkable. His generosity as an actor, he fed himself into that work. As an actor, you cannot take your eyes off him." ...|$|E

"Gypsy Biker" [...] {{concerns}} the homecoming of a US soldier {{killed in action}} in Iraq, and Springsteen has said that [...] "Livin' in the Future" [...] references extraordinary rendition and illegal wiretapping.

2500|$|Police did not {{say whether}} the search of the {{basement}} had turned up anything significant. But almost a year later, in May 2014, Bronx County prosecutors presented the evidence against Bonie [...] to a grand jury, which indicted him on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter. An [...] arrest warrant was issued for Bonie. The New York Post reported that an acquaintance had told police that Bonie had admitted to him that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to do with Moore's disappearance.|$|E
2500|$|Indiana Jones {{is modeled}} after the strong-jawed heroes of the [...] serials and pulp {{magazines}} that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg enjoyed in their childhoods (such as the Republic Pictures serials, and the Doc Savage series). Sir H. Rider Haggard's safari guide/big game hunter Allan Quatermain of King Solomon's Mines, who dates back to 1885, is a notable template for Jones. The two friends first discussed the project in Hawaii {{around the time of}} the release of the first Star Wars film. Spielberg told Lucas how he wanted his next project to be something fun, like a James Bond film (this would later be referenced when they cast Sean Connery as Henry Jones Sr.). According to sources, Lucas responded to the effect that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> [...] "even better," [...] or that he'd [...] "got that beat.".|$|E
