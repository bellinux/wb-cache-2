5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{investigate}} the crash. Scully suggests a man {{stopped the car}} but Doggett points out {{that it would have}} required a dense block of steel to stop the car. Nora Pearce appears and asks what happened to Curtis Delario. Soon afterwards, Scully finds Delario’s body left in a garbage can nearby; his face has gaping <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Autopsying the remains, Scully concludes that the five holes in the man’s face were made by human fingers, as someone reached into Delario’s head and pulled him out of the wrecked vehicle. Doggett finds a fresh fingerprint with the blood of Ray. Agent Doggett goes to see Nora Pearce and finds Harry Odell, who employed Ray Pearce at his salvage yard. Doggett asks about Ray, but Nora insists she saw Ray die; both do not believe Ray could be involved in Curtis’s death.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} driver mount is a {{flat panel}} (i.e., baffle) with the drivers mounted in <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> However, in this approach, sound frequencies with a wavelength {{longer than the}} baffle dimensions are canceled out, because the antiphase radiation {{from the rear of}} the cone interferes with the radiation from the front. With an infinitely large panel, this interference could be entirely prevented. A sufficiently large sealed box can approach this behavior.|$|E

25|$|This {{traditional}} tail vise {{also uses}} one large screw, either wooden or metal. It {{consists of a}} movable block {{with one or more}} dog <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> the movable block rides in a large mortise in the workbench. The jaw has a face that contacts the bench top, and the dog holes are in line with the dog holes on the bench top. The two main varieties of this vise depend on whether the screw nut is mounted in the bench or on the dog hole block. When the screw nut is mounted on the dog hole block the installation is more complicated and expensive, but the screw does not move in and out as the vise is used.|$|E
25|$|On 22 October 1944 Bellamy's troop {{was part}} of a screen for {{infantry}} advancing near Doornhoek in the south of the Netherlands when it came under small arms, mortar and artillery fire. He engaged the enemy posts, eventually taking out three, and assisted the infantry in getting forward. Machine gun bullets struck his tank and caused molten lead to splatter in his face, and his tank entered a minefield and nearly ran over a mine. A jerry can of petrol spilt and set his bedding on fire, but he managed to get his burning tank and crew to safety. His beret was later found to have two bullet <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> For his gallantry, he was awarded the Military Cross, which was personally presented to him by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery in a ceremony on 5 March 1945.|$|E
25|$|Soon, the Train was put {{in charge}} of the landing's water supply, {{something}} that had been neglected during the early stage of the campaign. As there was no supply available, water had to be brought by sea, often in petrol tins. This responsibility was given to the Train on 12 August, they were able to source three fire engines and some hoses, which, with the Train's pontoons were used to pump supplies brought from transport ships to tanks on the beach. The fire hoses were kept under guard, and eventually replaced with metal pipe as soldiers would constantly make <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> to get at the water inside. This was just some of the work that saw the Train removed from the 11th Division and directly attached to the IX Corps Engineers, becoming responsible for all work afloat or on the beach up to the high-water mark that the Navy might require.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 16th century, anatomist and surgeon Hieronymus Fabricius (1533–1619) {{described}} a useful technique for tracheotomy in his writings, although he had never actually performed the operation himself. He advised using a vertical incision and was the first to introduce the idea of a tracheostomy tube. This was a straight, short cannula that incorporated wings to prevent the tube from advancing too far into the trachea. He recommended the operation {{only as a last resort}} in cases of airway obstruction by foreign bodies or secretions. Fabricius' description of the tracheotomy procedure is similar to that used today. Julius Casserius (1561–1616) succeeded Fabricius as professor of anatomy at the University of Padua and published his own writings regarding technique and equipment for tracheotomy, recommending a curved silver tube with several <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Marco Aurelio Severino (1580–1656), a skillful surgeon and anatomist, performed multiple successful tracheotomies during a diphtheria epidemic in Naples in 1610, using the vertical incision technique recommended by Fabricius. He also developed his own version of a trocar.|$|E
25|$|A p–n {{junction}} diode {{is made of}} a crystal of semiconductor, usually silicon, but germanium and gallium arsenide are also used. Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative charge carriers (electrons), called an n-type semiconductor, and a region {{on the other side}} that contains positive charge carriers (holes), called a p-type semiconductor. When the n-type and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the depletion region because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor <b>holes)</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-type regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a p–n junction, is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher electrical potential is applied to the P side (the anode) than to the N side (the cathode), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-type side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical check valve.|$|E

500|$|An iris {{is a thin}} {{metal plate}} across the {{waveguide}} {{with one or more}} <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> [...] It is used to couple together two lengths of waveguide and is a means of introducing a discontinuity. [...] Some of the possible geometries of irises are shown in figure 5. [...] An iris which reduces the width of a rectangular waveguide has an equivalent circuit of a shunt inductance, whereas one which restricts the height is equivalent to a shunt capacitance. [...] An iris which restricts both directions is equivalent to a parallel LC resonant circuit. [...] A series LC circuit can be formed by spacing the conducting portion of the iris away from the walls of the waveguide. [...] Narrowband filters frequently use irises with small holes. [...] These are always inductive regardless of the shape of the hole or its position on the iris. [...] Circular holes are simple to machine, but elongated holes, or holes {{in the shape of a}} cross, are advantageous in allowing the selection of a particular mode of coupling.|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} seven amateur scuba divers solved the mystery in November 2006, when they found a small {{submarine}} sitting upright on the seabed, [...] below sea level and approximately [...] from Bungan Head, off Sydney's Northern Beaches. Commander Shane Moore, the officer responsible for the Royal Australian Navy's heritage collection, confirmed that the wreck was M-24 after viewing footage from multiple dives, along with measurements the group had taken. The wreck had several bullet <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> most likely from Chicagos quadruple machine-gun mount. The location of the wreck was kept secret by both the divers and the navy, with Defence Minister Brendan Nelson promising to have the wreck protected as a war grave. The wreck was gazetted on 1 December 2006 as a heritage site. A [...] exclusion zone was established around the wreck site, and any vessel entering the zone is {{liable to a fine}} under New South Wales law of up to A$1.1 million, with additional fines and confiscation of equipment under Commonwealth law. Shore- and buoy-mounted surveillance cameras and a sonar listening device further protect the site.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, [...] {{of silver}} were used, then worth over $1 billion. Nichols had {{to provide a}} monthly {{accounting}} to the Treasury. The [...] silver bars were taken under guard to the Defense Plant Corporation in Carteret, New Jersey, where they were cast into cylindrical billets, and then to Phelps Dodge in Bayway, New Jersey, where they were extruded into strips [...] thick, [...] wide and [...] long. Some 258 carloads were shipped under guard by rail to Allis-Chalmers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where they were wound onto magnetic coils and sealed into welded casings. Finally, they moved by unguarded flatcars to the Clinton Engineer Works. There, special procedures were instituted for handling the silver. When they had to drill <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> they did so over paper so that the filings could be collected. After the war, all the machinery was dismantled and cleaned and the floorboards beneath the machinery were ripped up and burned to recover minute amounts of silver. In the end, only 1/3,600,000th was lost. In May 1970, the last [...] of silver was replaced with copper {{and returned to the}} Treasury.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pneumatic}} siren, {{which is}} a free aerophone, consists of a rotating disk with <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> (called a chopper, siren disk or [...] ), such that the material between the holes interrupts a flow of air from fixed holes {{on the outside of}} the unit (called a stator). As the holes in the rotating disk alternately prevent and allow air to flow it results in alternating compressed and rarefied air pressure, i.e. sound. [...] Such sirens can consume large amounts of energy. To reduce the energy consumption without losing sound volume, some designs of pneumatic sirens are boosted by forcing compressed air from a tank that can be refilled by a low powered compressor through the siren disk.|$|E

However, {{it was not until}} 1907 that developments in amplification tube technology, by Lee de Forest and Arthur Korn among others, made the design practical.|$|E
2500|$|A saddle {{is often}} worn when a horse is longeing. In these circumstances, it is {{important}} that the stirrups do not bang against the horse's side.
