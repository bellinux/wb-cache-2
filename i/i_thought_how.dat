500|$|In October 2014, American singer Alicia Keys {{confirmed}} that {{she worked on}} Madonna's upcoming studio album, saying [...] "It was good. I was in here doing a meeting or something and [...] was working with Diplo. They were like, 'Oh, maybe you can play some piano on this thing'. And I was like, 'Alright. I'll try. If you hate it, {{you can take it}} off'. It was just like that, casual and cool." [...] Annie from the London Community Gospel Choir provided the female background vocals throughout the song. Madonna also mentioned that new versions would be [...] "coming out, but just not yet". Describing the song as [...] "one of [...] more mellow productions", Madonna composed [...] "Living for Love" [...] as a break-up song, commenting, [...] "lots of people write about being in love and being happy or they write about having a broken heart and being inconsolable. But nobody writes about having a broken heart and being hopeful and triumphant afterwards. So <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>how</b> can I do this? I didn't want to share the sentiment of being a victim. This scenario devastated me, but it just made me stronger". She complemented saying that [...] "Living for Love" [...] was [...] "kind of like the old me and the new me all mixed in together".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E
2500|$|About {{her first}} Olympic memory, she said, [...] "I {{remember}} watching Carly Patterson. She {{was one of}} my favorites. I loved her floor routine. I went to Olympic Trials that year (2004) with Kyla [...] I remember seeing the gymnasts on the floor and I loved all of their leotards. I thought they were so little and so amazing. <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>how</b> am I going to stay this little? I was worried that I was going to be really tall because my dad is 6'3" [...] and my mom is 5'2", so I didn’t know which one I was going to be." ...|$|E
60|$|TWEENY. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> as <b>how</b> {{they grew}} in rows {{on top of}} little sticks.|$|R
60|$|So I embraced him, and went. Alas! <b>I</b> little <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> {{we should}} meet again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{confess to}} {{something}} I'm not guilty of," [...] I returned. And then, as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>how</b> <b>I</b> had been treated, I cried out: ...|$|R
2500|$|Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo [...] "Gus" [...] Fring (recurring season 2, main cast season 3–4)– a Chilean {{high level}} drug {{distributor}} {{who has a}} cover as an owner of the fast food chain, Los Pollos Hermanos. Esposito stated that for the third season, he incorporated his yoga training in his performance. Gus is the coolest cucumber that ever walked the Earth. I think about Eddie Olmos way back in Miami Vice. He was like dead– he was hardly breathing. <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>how</b> is this guy just standing in this fire and doing nothing? Gus has totally allowed me that level of flexibility and relaxation– not because he has ultimate power and he knows he can take someone's life. He's just confident.|$|E
2500|$|Craven {{strove to}} make Krueger {{different}} from other horror-film villains of the era. [...] "A lot of the killers were wearing masks: Leatherface, Michael Myers, Jason," [...] he recalled in 2014. [...] "I wanted my villain to have a 'mask,' but {{be able to talk}} and taunt and threaten. So I thought of him being burned and scarred." [...] He also felt the killer should use something other than a knife, which was too common. [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>How</b> about a glove with steak knives? I gave the idea to our special-effects guy, Jim Doyle." [...] Ultimately two models of the glove were built: one called the [...] "hero glove" [...] used only whenever anything needs to be cut, and the other a stunt glove less likely to cause injury.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, you {{say that}} {{because you are a}} child yet, and do not know. You are even younger than <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> perhaps. <b>How</b> old are you, dear?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{turned away}} my face, and bore as best I might the pang that wrung me when I read those words. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> knew <b>how</b> dearly I loved him: I {{had never known}} it till that moment.|$|R
6000|$|CRAMPTON (satisfied {{with his}} advantage). <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> not. <b>How</b> soon d'y' think you'll {{be able to}} pay me if you have no better manners than to make game of your patients? (He sits down again.) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> I had mimicked him, {{and what}} an ass I had been.|$|E
60|$|I felt {{something}} like a pang when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> little trouble it had been.|$|E
6000|$|... "Clumsy fellows," [...] said I; [...] "they {{must still}} be drunk as owls." [...] And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> Captain Smollett would have set them skipping.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{so at the}} time; and, (by way, I suppose, of {{supporting}} my newly assumed philosophical character,) <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> too, <b>how</b> closely the greater number of our virtues are connected with the fear of death, and how little sympathy we bestow on pain, {{where there is no}} danger.|$|R
60|$|Dom. Hold a little; <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> better <b>how</b> {{to secure}} him, with less danger to us.|$|R
60|$|Then I told Hans {{as much as}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{advisable}} of <b>how</b> this horrid little talisman {{came into}} my possession.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When I {{came in and}} saw the pack-saddle over my head, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> dreadful {{it would}} be if it fell and killed me,' and she cried louder than before.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O Frank, you can't {{think what}} a relief that is to me. That dear, good, helpful, little lady--it really made me cry this morning when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> she had been used.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believed}} {{what you}} said, Stephen. But {{you were so}} strong, so calm, so sure of yourself. I think that made me angry when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> ridiculous I must have been." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is, indeed, count. Certainly, when I {{crossed the}} seas to take service here, <b>I</b> little <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> terrible was the {{struggle}} that was approaching. If we had known it, I {{am sure that}} my mother would never have let me leave home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> as <b>how</b> ye might git hungry on th' way," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Sanderson, {{with a broad}} grin. [...] "If ye don't want to eat them, {{you feed}} your hosses on 'em." [...] And he laughed at his little' joke.|$|R
60|$|I {{told myself}} then that my fancy had vested her tone and look with a kindliness {{far beyond that}} which they contained, and as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>how</b> <b>I</b> had deemed {{impatient}} the little gesture wherewith she had greeted Geneviève's interruption I laughed again.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} but smile at that when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> strange {{it would seem}} to my countrymen could they but see me {{kneeling}} there on the site of London, kissing the hand of England's queen.|$|E
60|$|Ant. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> {{those white}} arms would fold me in, And strain me close, and melt me into love; So pleased with that sweet image, I sprung forwards, And added all my {{strength}} to every blow.|$|E
60|$|As I listened, I didn't {{wonder that}} the jury {{looked as if they}} already {{considered}} me guilty: but I smiled to myself when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> utterly Emily's and the ploughman's evidence would rebut this unworthy suspicion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ho!" [...] echoed Bill; [...] "now, that's curious. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> as <b>how</b> {{you did it}} with grease, for {{it looks}} like it. Tell me now, {{how long did it}} take afore it growed that long?" [...] He lifted the end of the tail as he spoke.|$|R
6000|$|The {{surveyor}} presently {{joined them}} and remarked: [...] "As I have {{business at the}} new settlement, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I'd see <b>how</b> you were getting on." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{a benevolent}} little old man, this must be, <b>thought</b> <b>I,</b> and <b>how</b> very obliging.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> foolish {{it was for}} B. {{and myself}} to be wasting our time, gadding about Europe in this silly way. What earthly {{enjoyment}} was there in travelling--being jolted about in stuffy trains, and overcharged at uncomfortable hotels? ...|$|E
6000|$|Ethel flew at my bidding, while I unfastened {{the little}} bodice that but {{a moment before}} had heaved so lightly with the {{pulsations}} of a happy heart. Dear little Butterfly, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>how</b> cruelly have your poor little wings been crushed! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{breeze and}} the gentle {{motion of the}} boat were delightful, {{and for a moment}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> {{pleasant}} a life on the ocean must be. Alas! little did I realize what was in store for me on the boundless deep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Me! Johnny! Father's in {{a mortal}} rage {{with me for}} telling the captain, but <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> as <b>how</b> all the {{soldiers}} would come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] said Bastin, [...] "just {{like anybody}} else. You have more {{knowledge}} of the truth than <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> But pray, <b>how</b> did you destroy the world?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Crow {{states the}} {{inspiration}} for the song came from one of her father's sayings: [...] "My dad always said, ‘Drive it like it’s stolen, and park it like it’s rented.’ And <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> that’s <b>how</b> you have to live life. So I’ve always wanted to write a song with that idea in it".|$|R
