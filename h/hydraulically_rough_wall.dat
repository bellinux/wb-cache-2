40|$|The {{majority}} of analysis of <b>hydraulically</b> <b>rough</b> open-channel flows {{has been founded}} on the temporally-averaged momentum equations (RANS).   However, the structure of shallow open-channel flows over <b>hydraulically</b> <b>rough</b> beds, together with the near-bed region of deeper open-channel flows with rough beds awaits clarification.   The purpose of this project was to conduct an extensive programme of laboratory-based experiments to gauge {{the applicability of the}} double-averaged momentum equations for shallow open-channel flows over simple rough beds (transverse square bars with varying centre-to-centre pitch).   Proper assessment of the double-averaged equations requires comprehensive measurement of fluid velocities.   Therefore, detailed Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements have been obtained of the streamwise and bed-normal velocity components, including their variation in both temporal and spatial domains. The results show that double-averaging is a powerful tool for the analysis of <b>hydraulically</b> <b>rough</b> flows.   For a range of isolated flow types, the vertical distribution of the double-averaged streamwise velocity follows a linear trend between bars.   Quadrant analysis has been applied to the spatial, rather than temporal, fluctuations of velocity components for the first time, and double-averaging analysis has revealed areas of intense local momentum transfer despite negligible global momentum exchange over the averaging window.   This thesis also reports the discovery of an instability at the transition between wake interference and isolated roughness flows at which the overall properties of the flow are dramatically altered.

40|$|The {{critical}} {{conditions for}} incipient sediment motion induced by oscillating-grid generated turbulence interacting with a sloping sediment layer were investigated experimentally. Near-spherical monodisperse sediments were used throughout with relative densities of 1. 2 and 2. 5 and mean diameters(d) ranging between 80 and 1087 μm. Interaction characteristics were analysed {{in terms of}} the critical Shields parameter θc, defined using the peak root mean square (r. m. s) horizontal velocity component in the near-bed region. Bed slope effects on θc were investigated by tilting the bed (and the grid) at angles between 0 and the repose limit. In all cases, the grid was aligned to be parallel to the bed surface, so that the oscillation direction is always normal to bed surface. The measured values of θc on a horizontal bed were comparable to the values reported in the traditional Shields diagram with θc seen to increase monotonically for hydraulically smooth bedforms and to be approximately constant for <b>hydraulically</b> <b>rough</b> bedforms. To account for bed slope effects, the measured values of θc were compared with a force-balance model based on the conditions for incipient grain motion on a sloping bed. For hydraulically smooth bedforms, where the bed roughness is small compared to the boundary-layer depth, the model was derived to account for how viscous stresses act to damp the drag and lift forces acting on the near surface sediment. For <b>hydraulically</b> <b>rough</b> bedforms, where this viscous-damping effect is not present, the model assumes the standard approach with the drag and lift forces scaling with the square of the near-bed (inviscid) velocity scale. In both cases the model predicts the bedforms to become more mobile as the bed slope is increased. However, the damping effect of the viscous sublayer acts as a stabilizing influenced for hydraulically smooth bedforms, to reduce {{the rate at which the}} bed mobility increases with bed slope. The measured values of θc in the <b>hydraulically</b> <b>rough</b> bedforms were in agreement with the trends predicted by this model. However, measured θc in smooth bed cases were lower than predicted, and fall on the <b>hydraulically</b> <b>rough</b> trend when bed slope is < 20. When the bed slope reaches the repose limit, θc falls between the smooth-bed and rough-bed cases. Measurements of sediment trajectories due to the turbulence interacting with the bed were obtained, for a range of impact conditions. Observations of the sediment trajectories during the interaction show the individual sediment grains to be predominantly displaced in a circular 'splash'. Data showed that the ‘splash’ feature and particle entrainment within the turbulence structure was within one eddy turnover time. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

For the response of a channel flow to the step change in wall condition, the flow through a two-dimensional channel with short length of rough surface has been investigated numerically. The roughness elements were of the repeated square ribs with the pitch ratio W/h= 2 (W and h denote the roughness spacing and height, respectively). The length of rough surface was equivalent to the channel width (corresponding to an ”impulse” of surface roughness for the turbulent boundary layer). The surfaces of upstream and downstream from roughness were smooth and were of sufficient length to allow a fully developed in the smooth wall channel (plane Poiseuille flow) to be established. The Navier-Strokes equations (stream function-vorticity formulation) were solved by the finite difference method using the pseudo-unsteady technique. The calculation was performed for the flow in the different three cases of <b>rough</b> <b>wall</b> channel, and for the range of the Reynolds number Re< 1000.
