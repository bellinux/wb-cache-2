40|$|A {{series of}} isotherms have been {{measured}} {{to study the}} adsorption of four classes of dyes on various adsorbents. <b>Decolorizing</b> <b>carbon</b> has the highest adsorptive capacity, but an economic model indicates that peat and wood may be used since they too have high adsorptive capacities {{as well as being}} much cheaper...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Soybean {{concentration}} proteins were {{extracted from}} defatted soybean meals with ethanol agent method. Crude soybean oligosaccharides were gained after recovery the alcohol by concentration with the soybean whey water as row material. Then {{a series of}} purification process such as precipitating proteins, desalting with ion exchange and <b>decolorizing</b> <b>carbon</b> were used to obtain soybean oligosaccharides end product. The soybean oligosaccharides refining process technique and parameters were {{presented in this paper}} and could be applied to large-scale industrial production. Physical chemical quality index of soybean oligosaccharides after refining was that concentration was 70 %, total sugar purity was no less than 85 %, protein content was 1. 3 % (dry base content), ash content was 0. 73 % (dry base content) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} several enological {{practices}} on ochratoxin A (OTA) concentration in wines were evaluated. Analysis of OTA {{was performed by}} reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after immunoaffinity cleanup. Higher toxin levels were found in red wines (0. 017 to 0. 050 mu g/L) than white wines (0. 006 to 0. 022 mu g/L). Intensive pressing of pomace, prolonged drying of grapes, and storage in partially empty tanks increased OTA contamination of wines. Poor winery sanitation practice was {{the primary source of}} OTA contamination, as wines from contaminated wineries had the highest OTA values (0. 130 to 1. 300 mu g/L). Filtration through a 10 -pm membrane and heating on hot plates at 55 degrees C did not cause a significant decrease in the toxin level. An 80 % decrease of OTA was observed after wine filtration through a 0. 45 -mu m membrane (p < 0. 05). Eleven enological fining agents were tested to study their ability to remove OTA from wine. Enological <b>decolorizing</b> <b>carbon</b> removed (at 30 g/hL) up to 72 % of OTA. The Freundlich isotherm was used to model OTA adsorption on carbon. Results showed that carbon had selective adsorption (K-F = 3. 172 (mg/g) /(mg/L) (0. 8474)), but it did not affect polyphenol content and color of red wine. Nevertheless, a decrease of key sensory odorants of wine, such as 3 -methylbutyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, and geraniol, was observed...|$|E
