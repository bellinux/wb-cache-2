40|$|We {{quantify}} the atmospheric mass loss during planet formation {{by examining the}} contributions to atmospheric loss from both giant impacts and planetesimal accretion. Giant impacts cause global motion of the ground. Using analytic self-similar solutions and full numerical integrations we find (for <b>isothermal</b> <b>atmospheres</b> with adiabatic index (γ= 5 / 3) that the local atmospheric mass loss fraction for ground velocities v_g √(2) ρ_ 0 (π h R) ^ 3 / 2 (25 km for the current Earth), are able to eject all the atmosphere above the tangent plane of the impact site, which is h/ 2 R of the whole atmosphere, where h, R and ρ_ 0 are the atmospheric scale height, radius of the target, and its atmospheric density at the ground. 2) Smaller impactors, but above m> 4 πρ_ 0 h^ 3 (1 km for the current Earth) are only able to eject {{a fraction of the}} atmospheric mass above the tangent plane. We find that the most efficient impactors (per unit impactor mass) for atmospheric loss are planetesimals just above that lower limit and that the current atmosphere of the Earth could have resulted from an equilibrium between atmospheric erosion and volatile delivery to the atmosphere from planetesimals. We conclude that planetesimal impacts are likely to have {{played a major role in}} atmospheric mass loss over the formation history of the terrestrial planets.

40|$|Here {{we present}} high cadence {{photometry}} {{taken by the}} Acquisition Camera on Gemini South, of a close passage by the ~ 540 km radius Kuiper belt object, (50000) Quaoar, of a r' = 20. 2 background star. Observations {{before and after the}} event show that the apparent impact parameter of the event was 0. " 019 ± 0. " 004, corresponding to a close approach of 580 ± 120 km to the center of Quaoar. No signatures of occultation by either Quaoar's limb or its potential atmosphere are detectable in the relative photometry of Quaoar and the target star, which were unresolved during closest approach. From this photometry we are able to put constraints on any potential atmosphere Quaoar might have. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo and likelihood approach, we place pressure upper limits on sublimation supported, <b>isothermal</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of pure N_ 2, CO, and CH_ 4. For N_ 2 and CO, the upper limit surface pressures are 1 and 0. 7 μbar, respectively. The surface temperature required for such low sublimation pressures is ~ 33 K, much lower than Quaoar's mean temperature of ~ 44 K measured by others. We conclude that Quaoar cannot have an isothermal N_ 2 or CO atmosphere. We cannot eliminate the possibility of a CH_ 4 atmosphere, but place upper surface pressure and mean temperature limits of ~ 138 nbar and ~ 44 K, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Some recent {{observations}} at Pic-du-Midi (Mulleret al., 1992 a) {{suggest that}} the photospheric footpoints of coronal magnetic field lines occasionally move rapidly with typical velocities of the order 3 km s– 1 for about 3 or 4 min. We argue that such occasional rapid footpoint motions could have {{a profound impact on}} the heating of the quiet corona. Qualitative estimates indicate that these occasional rapid motions can account for the entire energy flux needed to heat the quiet corona. We therefore carry out a mathematical analysis to study in detail the response of a vertical thin flux tube to photospheric footpoint motions in terms of a superposition of linear kink modes for an <b>isothermal</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> We find the resulting total energy that is asymptotically injected into an <b>isothermal</b> <b>atmosphere</b> (i. e., an atmosphere without any back reflection). By using typical parameter values for fast and slow footpoint motions, we show that, even if the footpoints spend only 2. 5 % of the time undergoing rapid motions, still these rapid motions could be more efficient in transporting energy to the corona than the slow motions that take place most of the time...|$|E

40|$|We {{probe the}} {{structure}} and composition of the atmospheres of 5 hot Jupiter exoplanets using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC 3) instrument. We use the G 141 grism (1. 1 - 1. 7 μm) to study TrES- 2 b, TrES- 4 b, and CoRoT- 1 b in transit, TrES- 3 b in secondary eclipse, and WASP- 4 b in both. This wavelength region includes a predicted absorption feature from water at 1. 4 μm, which we expect to be nondegenerate with the other molecules {{that are likely to}} be abundant for hydrocarbon-poor (e. g. solar composition) hot Jupiter atmospheres. We divide our wavelength regions into 10 bins. For each bin we produce a spectrophotometric light curve spanning the time of transit and/or eclipse. We correct these light curves for instrumental systematics without reference to an instrument model. For our transmission spectra, our mean 1 -σ precision per bin corresponds to variations of 2. 1, 2. 8, and 3. 0 atmospheric scale heights for TrES- 2 b, TrES- 4 b, and CoRoT- 1 b, respectively. We find featureless spectra for these three planets. We are unable to extract a robust transmission spectrum for WASP- 4 b. For our dayside emission spectra, our mean 1 -σ precision per bin corresponds to a planet-to-star flux ratio of 1. 5 × 10 ^- 4 and 2. 1 × 10 ^- 4 for WASP- 4 b and TrES- 3 b, respectively. We combine these estimates with previous broadband measurements and conclude that for both planets <b>isothermal</b> <b>atmospheres</b> are disfavored. We find no signs of features due to water. We confirm that WFC 3 is suitable for studies of transiting exoplanets, but in staring mode multi-visit campaigns are necessary to place strong constraints on water abundance.

40|$|Abstract Based on {{previous}} work, we investigate {{the propagation of}} CMEs in a more realistic plasma environment than the <b>isothermal</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> and find {{that it is a}} slightly faster reconnection for flux ropes to break free. The average Alfvén Mach number MA for the inflow into the reconnection site has to be at least 0. 013 in order to give a plausible eruption (compared to MA = 0. 005 for the <b>isothermal</b> <b>atmosphere).</b> Taking MA = 0. 1, we find that the energy output and the electric field induced inside the current sheet match the temporal behavior inferred from the energetic, long duration, CME-associated X-ray events. The results indicate that catastrophic loss of equilibrium in the coronal magnetic field provides the most promising mechanism for major solar eruptions, and that the more energetic the eruption is, the earlier the associated flare peaks. The variation of the output power with the background field strength revealed by our calculations implies the poor cor-relation between slow CMEs and solar flares. This work also further confirms the explanation we proposed for the peculiar motion of giant X-ray arches and anoma-lous post-flare loops. Their kinematic pattern and observed heights are determined by the local Alfvén speed and its variation with height...|$|E

In analogy to the electro-chemical potential (well-known in solid-state physics and electro-chemistry) a gravito-chemical potential and a gravito-thermo-chemical potential, as well as the corresponding equilibria are introduced. We shall show that (a) the <b>isothermal</b> <b>atmosphere</b> is characterized by a constant gravito-chemical potential; (b) the well-mixed or adiabatic atmosphere is characterized by a constant gravito-thermo-chemical potential. Thus, a linear decrease of the temperature with the vertical coordinate corresponds to a state of equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|The {{computation}} {{of transmission}} spectra {{is a central}} ingredient {{in the study of}} exoplanetary atmospheres. First, we revisit the theory of transmission spectra, unifying ideas from several workers in the literature. Transmission spectra lack an absolute normalization due to the a priori unknown value of a reference transit radius, which is tied to an unknown reference pressure. We show that there is a degeneracy between the uncertainty in the transit radius, the assumed value of the reference pressure (typically set to 10 bar) and the inferred value of the water abundance when interpreting a WFC 3 transmission spectrum. Second, we show that the transmission spectra of <b>isothermal</b> <b>atmospheres</b> are nearly isobaric. We validate the isothermal, isobaric analytical formula for the transmission spectrum against full numerical calculations and show that the typical errors are ~ 0. 1 % (~ 10 ppm) within the WFC 3 range of wavelengths for temperatures of 1500 K (or higher). Third, we generalize the previous expression for the transit radius to include a small temperature gradient. Finally, we analyze the measured WFC 3 transmission spectrum of WASP- 12 b and demonstrate that we obtain consistent results with the retrieval approach of Kreidberg et al. (2015) if the reference transit radius and reference pressure are fixed to assumed values. The unknown functional relationship between the reference transit radius and reference pressure implies that it is the product of the water abundance and reference pressure that is being retrieved from the data, and not just the water abundance alone. This degeneracy leads to a limitation on how accurately we may extract molecular abundances from transmission spectra using WFC 3 data alone. Finally, we compare our study to that of Griffith (2014) and discuss why the degeneracy was missed in previous retrieval studies.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the nonextensive q-distribution function for a {{gas in the}} presence of an external field of force possessing a potential U(r). In the case of a dilute gas, we show that the power law distribution including the potential energy factor term can rigorously be deduced based on kinetic theoretical arguments. This result is significant as a preliminary to the discussion of long range interactions according to nonextensive thermostatistics and the underlying kinetic theory. As an application, the historical problem of the unbounded <b>isothermal</b> planetary <b>atmospheres</b> is rediscussed. It is found that the maximum height for the equilibrium atmosphere is z_max = K_BT/mg(1 -q).
