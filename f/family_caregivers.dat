5|$|Dementia {{caregivers}} {{are subject}} to high rates of physical and mental disorders. Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation. Regarding economic problems, <b>family</b> <b>caregivers</b> often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 {{per year in the}} United States, depending on the study.|$|E

The TAFC claims that (1) The government should share the burden of family carers; (2) The government should provide well-qualified respite services; (3) The government should provide family carers with training and support; (4) Labor policy should help employees fulfill their responsibilities as <b>family</b> <b>caregivers.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to evaluate a federal and state-funded <b>Family</b> <b>Caregiver</b> Support Program (FCSP) and explore what types of caregiver support service are associated with what caregiver outcomes. Information was obtained on a sample of 164 caregivers' use of eleven different types of support service. Descriptive and comparative analyses were used to detect the differences between users and nonusers of caregiver support services. Six measures included were caregiving appraisal scale, caregiving burden, caregiving mastery, caregiving satisfaction, hour of care, and service satisfaction. Using consulting and education services is associated with lessening of subjective burden; using financial support services is associated with more beneficial caregiver appraisal, such as better caregiver mastery. The findings are practical and helpful for future caregiver service and program development and evaluation and policy making for supporting caregivers. In addition, the evaluation method demonstrated in the study provided a simple and moderately effective method for service agencies which would like to evaluate their <b>family</b> <b>caregiver</b> support services. <b>Family</b> <b>Caregiver</b> Support Program Program evaluation Caregiver Support services...|$|R

5000|$|In contrast, {{subsequent}} research [...] {{has found}} that the benefit to <b>family</b> <b>caregivers</b> varies depending on the health of the person receiving care. Higher numbers of chronic conditions among those receiving care were associated with increased job stress, concern over making harmful errors, hypervigilance, feelings of depression, and feelings of suboptimal health among <b>family</b> <b>caregivers.</b> Nevertheless, <b>family</b> <b>caregivers</b> reported that they felt emotionally closer to the care recipient and that they were making a positive contribution to the care recipient’s life. In addition, training in medical and nursing tasks was found to have a protective effect for the family caregiver. Research has also found that most <b>family</b> <b>caregivers</b> said they had not received training about medication management from a professional, but rather had learned it on their own.|$|E
50|$|Taiwan Today {{reports that}} {{currently}} in Taiwan only 72,000 seniors, {{about one third}} of those receiving long-term care, live in nursing institutes.

Chen indicates that there were 600,000 <b>family</b> <b>caregivers</b> in Taiwan and they spent an average of 13.55 hours a day caregiving. 80 percent of these 600,000 <b>family</b> <b>caregivers</b> encountered limitations on social activities. 70 percent of them needed to take care of patients even when they did not feel well. He also mentions that 80 percent of <b>family</b> <b>caregivers</b> are women, and 50 percent of them are over 50 years old. Women {{are more likely to be}} regarded as natural caregivers because of gender expectations. Taiwanese females take care of children and spouses with chronicle illnesses to meet social norms and maintain filial piety. Among the <b>family</b> <b>caregivers</b> in Taiwan, some of them suffer from guilt, depression, nervousness, and injuries, sleeplessness, and hopelessness. Thus, it is a very essential task to promote the capabilities of <b>family</b> <b>caregivers</b> and improve their life quality.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} was to {{identify}} the literature that examined and explored physical and psychological morbidity and patient and <b>family</b> <b>caregiver</b> resilience following acute wound development and/or wound blistering post orthopaedic surgery. A systematic review of the literature using the databases MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE was undertaken. The papers were examined using title and abstract for relevance to the primary and secondary outcomes. The primary outcome of interest was <b>family</b> <b>caregiver</b> resilience following acute wound development and/or wound blistering post orthopaedic surgery. The search yielded 275 records after removing any duplicates; eight studies were considered eligible and were reviewed as full text. Following full review, none of the studies was included in this article. To conclude, there were no papers that investigated or examined the concept of resilience in relation to the management of acute post-surgical orthopaedic wounds. Four of the papers identified, following the review process, did discuss quality of life outcomes and how these may be improved following wound development; most papers focused on the management of chronic wounds. It is apparent from the review that there is no evidence currently available that explores patient and <b>family</b> <b>caregiver</b> resilience following acute wound development and/or wound blistering post orthopaedic surgery...|$|R
