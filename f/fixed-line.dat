Sales of mobile phones in 2005 totalled 816.6 million with that figure being almost equally shared amongst the markets of Asia/Pacific (204 m), Western Europe (164 m), CEMEA (Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa) (153.5 m), North America (148 m) and Latin America (102 m). In terms of new subscriptions over the five years from 1999, Africa has outpaced other markets with 58.2% growth. Increasingly these phones are being serviced by systems where the voice content is transmitted digitally such as GSM or W-CDMA with many markets choosing to deprecate analog systems such as AMPS.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Beta reached Providencia Island, on October 29, 2005. Rainfall {{from the}} storm were {{estimated}} over 12in (304mm). Roofs were damaged all over the island, and the island's main communications tower was knocked over. A total of 1,660 homes were damaged by the storm throughout the island, leaving 1.4millionColombian peso (2005COP; $681USD) in repair costs. This disrupted <b>fixed-line</b> telephone service and as the island has no cellular telephone service, it caused a total cessation of communication with the mainland. Beta's arrival on the island {{was accompanied by a}} seven-foot storm surge, which damaged beaches, coastal houses and roads, and washed out a tourist footbridge. Coral reefs around the island were, for the most part, untouched, as only 1percent of the coral sustained minor damage. Minor effects were also found around areas of sea grass. Beaches all around the island lost an average of 9.8ft (3m) of sand due to erosion. Thirty people were injured and 913 families, a total of 3,074 people, were affected during Hurricane Beta's passage over the island.|$|E

This paper explores the access substitution between <b>fixed-lines,</b> mobiles, and managed VoIP in a unified EU cross-country framework. We employ a half-yearly dataset for 20 EU countries for the 2008 - 2011 period and apply dynamic panel data methods. Our analysis demonstrates strong access substitution between <b>fixed-lines</b> and mobiles and provides indicative evidence on the substitution between <b>fixed-lines</b> and VoIP. Overall, we find evidence in favor of access substitution and therefore of joint market definition.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{reduction}} of the steady state amplitude of harmonically forced simply supported beams using mass dampers. The considered system consists of a mass damper attached to a simply supported beam with a harmonic force applied at a given point along its span. Traditionally, passive vibration devices such as mass spring dampers or mass dampers were attached to beams and carefully designed to minimize the maximum amplitude at a given point along their span. Since minimizing the amplitude at one point of the beam might increase it at another point, in this work the maximum amplitude along the entire beam span is minimized. The problem is solved first using an approximate method. For a given mass ratio, the optimal location of the mass damper is determined first, and then the optimal damping constant is calculated. <b>Fixed-lines</b> of the amplitude of the entire span of the beam which are independent of the damping constant are determined. The optimal placement of the mass damper is chosen such that the maximum of these lines is minimized. Then, the optimal damping constant is obtained analytically from an average of two damping ratios corresponding each to one of the peaks of the amplitude of the entire beam span to coincide with one of the two equally leveled maxima of the <b>fixed-lines.</b> The optimal placement and damping constant are calculated for all possible positions of the point force on the beam. These results are compared to those obtained from an exact numerical optimization procedure. The results are written in dimensionless form and can be applied to a system with any material and geometric properties. N/...|$|R

Experimental campaigns performed at the CERN Proton Synchrotron in 2002 and at the GSI SIS 18 in 2008 confirmed the existence of an underlying mechanism in the beam dynamics of periodic resonance crossing induced by the synchrotron motion and space charge. In this article we present an extension of the previous studies to describe the effect of space charge on a controlled coupled (2 D) third order resonance. The experimental and simulation results of this latest campaign shed a new light on the difficulties of the 2 D particle dynamics. We find striking experimental evidence that space charge and the coupled resonance create an unusual coupling in the phase space, leading to the formation of an asymmetric halo. Moreover, this study demonstrates a clear link between halo formation and <b>fixed-lines...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{market for}} local {{telephone}} services was opened up to competition in 1990, {{but it was not}} until 1999 that the first local service customers were signed up by competitors. The absence of number portability, however, is the main inhibitor for competition to take off. Competition is more fierce on the market for long-distance (LD) services, which is liberalised since January 1997. Many concession titles were issued, though actual competition remains limited to three main competitors: Telmex, Avantel and Alestra, which represent over 92 percent of total LD revenues. The market for mobile telephony was initiated in 1987 and Mexico was divided into nine regions. Duopoly concessions were granted in each and Telcel obtained the sole nationwide license. This is one of the reasons Telcel has been able to remain the most important player within mobile telecommunications with a market share of 78 percent in 2002. Internet services are dominated by both telecom operators and cable operators. The dial-up market remains by far the most important, however, dominated by Telmex with close to 65 percent market share in 2002. Combining all types of Internet access, Telmex is market leader with 58 percent of total accounts in services in 2002. Competition led to increased investments, which were allocated towards building infrastructure. Higher penetration rates consequently resulted. The effect of liberalising telecom services does not totally add to higher penetration rates, however, since carriers decided to build their own infrastructure causing redundant capacity. When comparing the level of main-line penetration with penetration rates in OECD countries, Mexico’s rates are alarmingly low with a registered rate of 14. 6 in 2002. Together with low Internet penetration rates (3. 6 percent in 2001) a digital divide reveals itself. More importantly, based on mainline density figures per district an internal digital divide is manifest. The income gap between the northern and southern states is mirrored in telecom infrastructure development. This goes as well for mobile telephony, although prepaid mobile programs, introduced in 1995, and (local) calling party pays (CPP), introduced in 1999 have resulted in skyrocketing growth and penetration rates. The amount of mobile subscribers trespassed the amount of operational <b>fixed-lines</b> in 2000. Now, almost 26 million Mexicans are mobile subscribers. Overall, quality of services has been found to improve as a consequence of reform and tariffs were taken down. The objective of providing access to telecommunications to everyone against low costs remains far from being reached, however. Given low penetration rates and favourable economic conditions, there is still significant room for growing adoption of telecommunication services. ...|$|R

25|$|Han poetry as a {{style of}} poetry {{resulted}} in significant poems which are still preserved today, and which have their origin associated with the Han dynasty era of China, 206 BC – 220 AD, including the Wang Mang interregnum (9–23 AD). The final years {{at the end of}} the Han era (known by the name Jian'an, 196—220) often receive special handling for purposes of literary analysis because, among other things, the poetry and culture of this period is less than typical of the Han period, and has important characteristics of its own, or it shares literary aspects with the subsequent Three Kingdoms period. This poetry reflects one of the poetry world's more important flowerings, as well as being a special period in Classical Chinese poetry, particularly in regard to the development of the quasipoetic fu; the activities of the Music Bureau in connection with the collection of popular ballads and the resultant development of what would eventually become known as the yuefu, or as the rhapsodic formal style; and, finally, towards the end of the Han Dynasty, the development of a new style of shi poetry, as the later development of the yuehfu into regular, <b>fixed-line</b> length forms makes it difficult to distinguish in form from the shi form of poetic verse, and at what point specific poems are classified as one or the other is somewhat arbitrary.
