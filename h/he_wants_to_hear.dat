5|$|The Smoking Man {{meets with}} the Syndicate, who are {{responsible}} for the bees. Soon afterward a swarm of bees attacks a school in Columbia, South Carolina, and one of the teachers dies as a result. Skinner heads to the hospital, where he is met by Covarrubias. She demands to know what he knows about the matter. He tells her he believes that the bees are being used as a carrier for some sort of experiment. Skinner returns home where he is confronted by Mulder, who now suspects that Skinner has been working against him all this time. Skinner is able to convince Mulder that he would not have forced his own drawer lock open and hence could not have been the murderer. Convinced of Skinner's evidence, Mulder turns in the gun with the serial number filed off so Skinner is not blamed for the murder. That night Skinner confronts The Smoking Man in his apartment, angry that nothing has been done for Scully. The Smoking Man convinces him that Scully will die if he kills him and Skinner leaves without killing him, but not before firing warning shots. Shortly afterwards Covarrubias calls The Smoking Man, who tells her to tell Mulder what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> while an unknown man is shown behind her listening on another phone.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{includes}} {{a variety of}} cultural references. Among Smithers' paintings of Burns is a parody of a photograph of Russian president Vladimir Putin riding a horse while bare-chested. Smithers likens Homer, Lenny and Carl to The Three Stooges, and Homer chooses Smithers' potential partners via the gay dating app Grindr. At the party, George Takei asks another man if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> [...] "horror stories" [...] about his Star Trek co-star William Shatner, and he is pleased that the man does not know who Shatner is. A billboard outside the school's production of Casablanca advertises that the kindergarten are putting on a production of zoophilia-themed play Equus the following night. [...] The end sequence with the treasure hunt pays homage to Bogart's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The African Queen.|$|E
500|$|Amidst these drastic changes, large {{proportions}} of the freshmen classes (some as high as 30%) contained all-state high school band members. As the band's experience and musical talents grew, {{the quality of the}} music improved dramatically. Haney even rewrote the drills to include a portion where the band stopped moving and played to the audience. This innovation was well received and became a staple of the band's repertoire. In 1975, at a televised game versus the University of Arkansas, the Aggie Band was repeatedly asked to play music during lulls in the game. By the fourth quarter, the Aggie Band had played on TV during every break and Colonel Haney, trying his best to be fair, told the cameraman that they really should let the Razorback Band play a little too. The cameraman called up to the broadcast booth to get guidance and then replied, [...] "The director doesn't want to hear the Arkansas band, <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the Aggie Band." ...|$|E

2500|$|Both Goebbels and Magda derived {{personal}} {{benefits and}} social status from their close association with Hitler, and the couple remained loyal to Hitler and publicly supported him. Privately, however, Magda expressed doubts, especially after the war began to go badly on the Eastern Front. On 9 November 1942, during a gathering with friends listening to a speech by Hitler, she switched off the radio exclaiming, [...] "My God, {{what a lot of}} rubbish." [...] In 1944, she reportedly said of Hitler, [...] "He no longer listens to voices of reason. Those who tell him what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> are the only ones he believes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next day, Duke {{arrives at}} the race, and heads out with his photographer, {{a man by the}} name of Lacerda. During the coverage, Duke becomes irrational and {{believes}} that they are in the middle of a battlefield, so he fires Lacerda and returns to the hotel. After consuming more mescaline, as well as huffing diethyl ether, Duke and Gonzo arrive at the Bazooko Circus casino, but leave shortly afterwards, the chaotic atmosphere frightening Gonzo. Back in the hotel room, Duke leaves Gonzo unattended, and tries his luck at a quick round of Big Six. When Duke returns, he finds that Gonzo, after consuming a full sheet of LSD, has trashed the room, and is sitting fully clothed in the bathtub, attempting to pull the tape player in with him, as <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the song better. He pleads with Duke to throw the machine into the water when the song [...] "White Rabbit" [...] peaks. Duke agrees, but instead throws a grapefruit at Gonzo's head before running outside.|$|E

6000|$|... "You are {{to go and}} see {{the king}} at once," [...] Captain Jervoise said as he dismounted.

60|$|Jill hesitated. She disliked {{discussing}} {{her private}} affairs, {{but there was}} obviously no way of avoiding it. Nelly was round-eyed and mystified, and Mr. Brown had manifestly no intention whatever of withdrawing tactfully. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> all.|$|R
5000|$|This teenaged Brother Blood {{seemingly}} based all {{his decisions}} on advice from Mother Mayhem, {{but this was}} actually a female cultist chosen at random and killed if the advice was not what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> <b>He</b> also exhibited vampiric abilities.|$|R
50|$|On October 31, 1896, he held {{a meeting}} {{with members of the}} Benin Rivers trading {{companies}} to introduce himself to the traders.

6000|$|... "AUGUST 29th. While Friedrich {{was pushing}} into Neipperg, in the Baumgarten Country, and could get no battle out of him, Excellency Robinson reappears at Breslau; Maria Theresa, after deadly efforts on his part, has mended her offers, in these terrible circumstances; and Robinson is here again. 'Half of Silesia, or almost half, {{provided}} his Majesty will turn round, and help against the French:' these, secretly, are Robinson's rich offers. The Queen, on consenting {{to these new}} offers, had 'wrung her hands,' like one in despair, and said passionately, 'Unless accepted within a fortnight, I will not be bound by them!' 'Admit his Excellency to the honor of an interview,' solicits Hyndford; 'his offers are much mended.' Notable to witness, Friedrich will not see Robinson at all this time, nor even permit Podewils to see him; signifies plainly that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> no more of his offers, and that, in fact, the sooner he can take himself away from Breslau, {{it will be the}} better. To that effect, Robinson, rushing back in mortified astonished manner, reports progress at Presburg; to that and no better. 'High Madam,' urges Robinson, still indefatigable, 'the King of Prussia's help would be life, his hostility is death at this crisis. Peace must be with him, at any price!' 'Price?' answers her Majesty once: 'If Austria must fall, it is indifferent to me whether it be by Kur-Baiern or Kur-Brandenburg!' [Stenzel, iv. 156.] Nevertheless, in about a week she again yields to intense conjuring, and the ever-tightening pressure of events;--King George, except it be for counselling, is become stock-still, with Maillebois's sword at his throat; and is, without metaphor, sinking towards absolute neutrality: 'Cannot help you, Madam, any farther; must not try it, or I perish, my Hanover and I!'--So that Maria Theresa again mends her offers: 'Give him all Lower Silesia, and he to join with me!' and Robinson post-haste despatches a courier to Breslau with them. Notable again: King Friedrich will not hear of them; answers by a 'No, I tell you! Time was, time is not. I have now joined with France; and to join against it in this manner? Talk to me no more!'" [...] [Friedrich to Hyndford: [...] "Au Camp [de Neuendorf] 14me septembre," [...] 1741. [...] "Milord j'ai recu les nouvelles propositions d'alliance que l'infatigable Robinson vous envoie. Je les trouve aussi chimeriques que les precedentes."--"Ces gens sont-ils fols, Milord, de s'imaginer que je commisse la trahison de tourner en leur faveur mes armes, et de"--"Je vous prie de ne me plus fatiguer avec de pareilles propositions, et de me croire assez honnete homme pour ne point violer mes engagements.-- FREDERIC."

6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} {{do you know}} about my way of doing my business?" [...] he burst out when the lawyer had done. [...] "One of us two is talking like a born idiot--and (mind this) it isn't me. Look here! Your young lady goes out for a walk, and she meets with a dirty, shabby old beggar--I look like a shabby old beggar already, don't I? Very good. This dirty old wretch whines and whimpers and tells a long story, and gets sixpence out of the girl--and knows her by that time, inside and out, as well as if he had made her--and, mark! hasn't asked her a single ques tion, and, instead of {{annoying}} her, has made her happy in the performance of a charitable action. Stop a bit! I haven't done with you yet. Who blacks your boots and shoes? Look here!" [...] He pushed his pug-dog off his lap, dived under the table, appeared again with an old boot and a bottle of blackening, and set to work with tigerish activity. [...] "I'm going out for a walk, you know, and I may as well make myself smart." [...] With that announcement, he began to sing over his work--a song of sentiment, popular in England {{in the early part of}} the present century--"She's all my fancy painted her; she's lovely, she's divine; but her heart it is another's; and it never can be mine! Too-ral-loo-ral-loo'. I like a love-song. Brush away! brush away! till I see my own pretty face in the blacking. Hey! Here's a nice, harmless, jolly old man! sings and jokes over his work, and makes the kitchen quite cheerful. What's that you say? He's a stranger, and don't talk to him too freely. You ought to be ashamed of yourself to speak in that way of a poor old fellow with one foot in the grave. Mrs. Cook will give him a nice bit of dinner in the scullery; and John Footman will look out an old coat for him. And when he's heard everything <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> and doesn't come back again the next day to his work--what do they think of it in the servants' hall? Do they say, 'We've had a spy among us!' Yah! you know better than that, by this time. The cheerful old man has been run over in the street, or is down with the fever, or has turned up his toes in the parish dead-house--that's what they say in the servants' hall. Try me in your own kitchen, and see if your servants take me for a spy. Come, come, Mr. Lawyer! out with your ten pounds, and don't waste any more precious time about it!" ...|$|E
