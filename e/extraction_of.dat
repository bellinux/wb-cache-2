The novel approach requires μL volumes of samples and organic, which form consecutive immiscible plugs in a transparent polymeric capillary the extraction process is accelerated by application of d. c. voltage. Number of the, their composition, volume and sequence in the extraction capillary can be chosen for each particular application and high variability and selectivity of the process can be achieved.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} revisits subject island effects (Ross 1967, Chomsky 1973) cross-linguistically. Controlled acceptability judgment {{studies in}} German, English, Japanese and Serbian suggest that <b>extraction</b> out <b>of</b> specifiers is consistently degraded compared to <b>extraction</b> out <b>of</b> complements, {{indicating that the}} Condition on Extraction domains (CED, Huang 1982) is still empirically viable, contrary to recent claims (Stepanov 2007). As a consequence, recent treatments of the CED in terms of Multiple Spell-Out (Uriagereka 1999) are still tenable. First, a series of NP-subextraction experiments in German using was für -split is discussed. The results indicate that subject island effects cannot be reduced to freezing effects (Wexler & Culicover 1981). <b>Extraction</b> out <b>of</b> in-situ subjects is degraded compared to <b>extraction</b> out <b>of</b> in-situ objects. Freezing incurs an additional cost, i. e., <b>extraction</b> out <b>of</b> moved domains is degraded compared to in-situ domains. Further results from German indicate that <b>extraction</b> out <b>of</b> in-situ unaccusative and passive subjects is en par with <b>extraction</b> out <b>of</b> objects, while <b>extraction</b> out <b>of</b> in-situ transitive and intransitive unergative subjects causes a decrease in acceptability. Additionally, <b>extraction</b> out <b>of</b> indirect objects is degraded compared to <b>extraction</b> out <b>of</b> direct objects. It is also observed that a second gap improves the acceptability of otherwise illicit was für -split, a phenomenon dubbed Across-the-Board (ATB) - was für -splitand analysed in terms of Sideward Movement (Hornstein & Nunes 2002). Furthermore, wh-extraction out of non-finite sentential arguments also shows a significant subject/object asymmetry. Experiments in English indicate that NP-subextraction yields the familiar subject/object asymmetry, while the contrast largely disappears when PPs are fronted. Further results show that ECM and passive predicates do not improve the acceptability <b>of</b> the <b>extraction</b> out <b>of</b> subjects. Finally, subject subextraction patterns in Japanese and Serbian are investigated. Both Long-distance scrambling and clefting out of sentential subjects in Japanese leads to a stronger degradation than out of sentential objects. PP-extraction in Serbian also shows the same subject/object asymmetry, while no such contrast is found for Left Branch Extraction...|$|R
