Quatermass convinces the consciousness of the three crewmen buried deep inside the creature to turn against it and destroy it; this appeal to the last remains of their humanity succeeds in defeating the organism.|$|E

5|$|In February 1946, Mutual {{introduced}} a quiz show, Twenty Questions, that would run {{for more than}} seven years. In October, the detective series Let George Do It, starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, starting in 1946 as well, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show Smile Time, out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: Kate Smith Speaks, at noon, and Kate Smith Sings, later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b> The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet, Please, which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, Box 13, which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.|$|E

25|$|EMT {{training}} programs vary greatly in calendar length (number of days or months).

In addition to each level's didactic education, clinical rotations may also be required (especially for levels above EMT). Similar in a sense to medical school clinical rotations, EMT students are required to spend a required amount of time in an ambulance and on a variety of hospital services (e.g. obstetrics, emergency medicine, surgery, psychiatry) in order to complete a course and become eligible for the certification exam. The number of clinical hours for both time in an ambulance and time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> vary depending on local requirements, the level the student is obtaining, and the amount of time it takes the student to show competency.|$|E
25|$|When Jeopardy! {{made the}} move on December 31, 1984, WABC {{was looking to}} improve its ratings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> leading up to Eyewitness News at 5:00p.m..

The station first tried Name That Tune as the accompanying program, but the show had already been struggling in the ratings in its earlier morning timeslot and did not fare better. Thus, WABC moved it to a late-night timeslot and added Divorce Court in its place in early 1985. While Divorce Court was popular, the fictional court program switched stations for the fall of 1985. WABC responded by signing on as an affiliate for the syndicated edition of Sale of the Century, which had been airing on WOR since its January 1985 premiere and was entering its second season that fall. But once again, the station was left needing another solution, as Sale became the third straight problematic Jeopardy! lead-out program and was cancelled by its syndicator in 1986.|$|E

25|$|The {{start of}} the First Test in Mumbai was overshadowed {{by the death of}} Sir Donald Bradman, universally {{regarded}} as the greatest batsman in cricket history. After a minute's silence, Australian captain Steve Waugh won the toss and elected to field on a pitch offering assistance to the bowling team. Ganguly stated that he would have done likewise. The Australian fast bowlers quickly removed India's top order, with both openers and Rahul Dravid removed in the first hour's play with only 31 runs scored. After Ganguly was removed with the score on 55, the Indians progressed to be 4/62 at lunch. Sachin Tendulkar lead a counterattack <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> after lunch, scoring 53 runs in 53 balls to take the score to 4/130 before V. V. S. Laxman was removed.

Shane Warne took 4/47 while Glenn McGrath managed 3/19. In reply, Australia reached 1/49 at stumps, losing Michael Slater.|$|E
25|$|At {{an early}} date mystical {{reasons for the}} {{division}} of the day were sought. St. Cyprian sees in the hours of Terce, Sext and Nones, which come after a lapse of three hours, an allusion to the Trinity. He adds that these hours already consecrated to prayer under the Old Dispensation have been sanctified in the New Testament by great mysteriesTerce by the descent of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles; Sext by the prayers of St. Peter, the reception of the Gentiles into the Church, or yet again by the crucifixion of Christ; Nones by the death of Christ. St. Basil merely recalls that it was at the ninth hour that the Apostles Peter and John were wont to go to the Temple to pray. St. John Cassian, who adopts the Cyprian interpretation for Terce and Sext, sees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hour</b> of Nones the descent of Christ into hell. But, as a rule, it is the death of Christ that is commemorated at the Hour of Nones.|$|E
