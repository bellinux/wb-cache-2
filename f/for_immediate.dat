5|$|After O'Grady {{was shot}} down, {{tensions}} increased greatly between NATO and the Bosnian Serbs. A number of US commanders called <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> retaliatory air strikes; however, the Serbs still held {{the majority of}} the hostages seized after the bombing of Pale. The threat to the hostages prevented NATO from acting more forcefully, and the Serbs released 121 hostages immediately after the incident in an effort to cool tensions. Nonetheless, the situation remained explosive for the next six days until O'Grady was rescued on 8 June by the 3rd Battalion 8th Marines 2nd Marine Division, ending the calls <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> offensive action. Shortly thereafter, the Serbs released the remaining hostages. As a result of the incident, NATO ordered that all further sorties be accompanied by aircraft designed for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD).|$|E

Two imperial commissioners for each province had the task of getting hold of the statues and having them melted <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> minting—with {{the exception of a}} number of bronze statues who were used as public monuments for the beautification of the new capital in Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|The first Singaporean elections, held in March 1948, {{were limited}} as only {{six of the}} twenty-five seats on the Legislative Council were to be elected. Only British {{subjects}} had the rights to vote, and only 23,000 or about 10% of those eligible registered to vote. Other members of the Council were chosen either by the Governor or by the chambers of commerce. Three of the elected seats were won by a newly formed Singapore Progressive Party (SPP), a conservative party whose leaders were businessmen and professionals and were disinclined to press <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> self-rule.

5|$|These troops, {{who were}} trained soldiers, were {{responsible}} for preparing the combat reports {{to be used as}} source material for the OKW communiqués. The propaganda companies were only news-reporting units in areas of military operation, as civilian news correspondents were prohibited from entering combat zones.

The filtered materials were then forwarded to the Ministry of Propaganda <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> dissemination.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Piketty, French {{economist}} {{and author of}} the bestselling book Capital in the Twenty-First Century regards taxes on capital as a more favorable option than austerity (inefficient and unjust) and inflation (only affects cash but neither real estates nor business capital).

5|$|While imprisoned and {{awaiting}} execution, Beauchamp wrote a confession. He accused Patrick Darby {{of perjury}} {{with regard to}} the alleged 1824 meeting between them.

When Beauchamp finished the confession in mid-June 1826, his uncle, Senator Beauchamp, took it to the state printer <b>for</b> <b>immediate</b> publication.
