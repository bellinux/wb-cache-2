5000|$|Many {{assumptions}} {{have been}} made regarding Cato's character based upon his endorsement of the marriage between Marcia and Hortensius. Appian said that [...] "as a girl; Cato was extremely fond of her, and she had borne him children. Nevertheless, he gave her to Hortensius, one of his friends,— who desired to have children but {{was married to a}} childless wife..." [...] This sacrifice is used by Plutarch and other historians to illustrate Cato's <b>honorability</b> and his willingness to sacrifice a wife he liked in the name of friendship. This positive interpretation of Cato's character is reflected in Lucan's Pharsalia and how the Uticans mourned his death.|$|E

5000|$|Honor (HON): Also {{suggested}} in the 5th Edition Dungeon Master's Guide, an option for campaigns shaped by a strict code of honor like East-Asia-inspired ones or those {{with a focus on}} chivalry of any sort. It determines both how well the character adheres to the respective society's code and how well he understands its tenets. It may also reflect others' perception of the character's <b>honorability.</b> Mechanically, high (or low) honor is used in social interaction in situations in which it may be more relevant than a person's charisma or in a saving throw to resist for example the urge to act dishonorably. Unlike others, this ability score can not be raised by the player after character creation. Instead, the dungeon master can increase (or decrease) its value by 1 {{at the end of an}} adventure according to the player character's actions throughout it.|$|E

The history of business <b>honorability</b> is discussed in addition to its applicability to today's expectations. A solution of trust bridges is suggested to find commonalities between two parties in order to strengthen their network and relationship with one another. These postulates were investigated during the American Marketing Association's Special Interest Group conference on “The Honorable Merchant in International Marketing” hosted in Cancun, Mexico, in the spring of 2014. At the conference, a three-round Delphi study was conducted to analyze the various global perspectives participants had on honorable practices in academia and business and their relation to international marketing...|$|E
40|$|Reputation in the Medieval French Language : Outline of an Onomasiological Glossary of Middle French. - The {{glossary}} of Middle French {{presented here}} comprises terms illustrating the actual concept of reputation with its dual meaning of « <b>honorability</b> » and of « notoriety », {{that is to}} say, honneur, gloire, fame, los, bruit, renommée. Gloire is opposed to honneur {{in the way that}} heaven is opposed to earth, while the term los emanates from decisions taken by the community. Los, having become archaic, is replaced by cri, then bruit. Lastly, renommée, having taken the feminine gender, designates the synthesis of bruit and of the ancient fame, preparing the way for the modern réputation. Roques Gilles.

40|$|Family Structures and Solidarity in 15 th Century Marseille: The Social Rise of the Forbin. C. Maurel. The micro-history of the Forbin {{family in}} Marseille and Provence around the 15 th century—as it rose from artisanal <b>honorability,</b> to mercantile success {{and then on}} to the ranks of the country gentry—constitutes an {{exemplary}} case of family social rising based on commercial enrichment, princely favors, and strong lineal cohesion. Despite the family's recourse to dividing up their inheritance, its absence of communal economic structure, the dispersion of its hearth and burial-grounds, and its appreciable socio-economic heterogeneity, the Forbin 's saga shows how a high degree of political solidarity, as well as a sharing and defense of its collective symbolic inheritance—family name, coat of arms, emblem, and geneological records—were, {{in the course of the}} family's rise, the linchpins of the success of this naissant aristocratic "house".

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} ideological constitutions of the honor-code from the non-traditional {{point of view}} of jealousy. Here, jealousy is not understood as a pathology but as a social anxiety against subjects for reasons of gender and race. As a social scheme, the jealous plot is mainly constituted through four social narratives: the emergence of the modern state, the courtesan model of love, a manipulation of morality, and a latent subtext of racism and misogyny that permeate the before mentioned. I propose an ideological approach for jealousy, one that allows us to reveal the underlying contradictory criteria displayed by the English and Spanish society of the seventeenth century. From this perspective, jealousy becomes a screen that hides or silences the moral or ethical inconsistencies that according to Michel Foulcault or David Goldberg are intrinsic to the foundations of our modern society. ^ The works by Shakespeare, Cervantes and Zayas studied here were not chosen because these authors exemplify the working of jealousy as a corrective mechanism, but rather, because they expose the flaws of the honor-code, its moral inconsistencies. These works not only exhibit husbands or suitors who are censored by their jealous condition (in one way or another they all are punished by it), they also elicit the ideological critique of a society that refuses to acknowledge any kind of <b>honorability</b> not based on the honor code. As Cervantes 2 ̆ 7 s famous sentence anticipated and summarized, “cada hombre es hijo de sus obras” [“each man is the son of his own deeds”] each man should be the one and only responsible for the <b>honorability</b> of his acts and his persona, and so he proves in El celoso extremeño [The Jealous Old Man from Extremadura]. Shakespeare and Zayas agreed and implemented such a statement, extending it to the ethnically-marked man in the case of Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s Othello, and to the overprotected woman in the case of Zayas 2 ̆ 7 s El prevenido engañado and La inocencia castigada. ^ From an ideological point of view, jealousy becomes not only the means that justifies particular expectations and exemplary punishments but also the powerful argument that leaves the door open to abuses and manipulations committed in the name of morality. In sum, the jealousy studied in these works is one of the subtlest devices that patriarchy counts on to reinforce its ideological constituencies. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the middle}} {{decades of the}} nineteenth century, France {{embarked}} on the conquest of its modern colonial empire with the invasion of Algeria in 1830. This dissertation analyzes {{the relationship between the}} Algerian conquest and French national identity between 1830 and 1851, through an interdisciplinary study of representations of Algeria in French culture and colonial policy during the July Monarchy and Second Republic. In these foundational years, French intellectuals, cultural entrepreneurs, and policy-makers portrayed Algeria as a site for European settlement and as a site of military conquest. Both of these images were formulated and spread in travel accounts, popular prints, and government propaganda. Each portrayed the new territory and its growing European population as part of the French nation, but, I argue, they did so in different ways that were not always compatible. ^ In the first of the dissertation 2 ̆ 7 s two parts, I focus on {{the emergence of a new}} theory of European settlement and on the policy mechanisms developed to put it into practice in Algeria. Social reforming publishers and French colonial administrators encouraged and disseminated the ideals of rural colonization through landscape imagery in guidebooks and in the nascent illustrated press, while colonial administrators in Paris and Algiers struggled, relatively unsuccessfully, to create a correspondingly pastoral colonial society by regulating migration to and settlement in Algeria. ^ Part two analyzes the military themes that predominated in popular culture, which cheered the conquest as the return of an earlier era of militaristic male citizenship. Mass-produced broadsheets of Algerian battle scenes appealed to nostalgia for the Napoleonic period, and forged affective links between French consumers and the nascent colony. The constitutional July Monarchy attempted to harness this militaristic nationalism to its own ends by putting the Algerian conquest at the center of royal iconography in the 1840 s. These efforts proved double-edged, as popular representations of the military conquest drew attention to the violence of conquest, undermining efforts to recruit settlers and raising doubts about the <b>honorability</b> of French military action in North Africa. Despite the peaceable rhetoric of settlement, mid-nineteenth century Frenchmen could not separate colonization from the realities of colonial violence. ...|$|E
