40|$|West was {{the lead}} {{researcher}} for and designer of the CareCentre, a fully realised and manufactured hospital-ward product. It {{was funded by the}} EPSRC as part of the Designing Out Medical Error (DOME) project (2008 - 11). The initial design brief was to improve hand hygiene and compliance with infection control protocols at the bedside. This {{was the first time that}} the complex system of clinical processes within the bed space was considered from a design viewpoint, treating it as an overarching system, rather than discrete isolated processes. The design emerged from a parallel analysis of five common bedside care processes. West led research within a prescriptive framework (a prospective hazard analysis tool adapted from FMEA - Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) and co-design within a more fluid approach (including De Bono’s creative techniques). The CareCentre is a product placed at the end of the patient’s bed, containing all equipment used for common bedside care. A direct translational output with impact on clinical care, it improves use of aprons and gloves among healthcare practitioners, increases the use of <b>hand</b> <b>sanitising</b> <b>gel,</b> and streamlines the clinical workflow. Cluster-randomised crossover clinical trials (Anderson et al. 2012) have demonstrated its efficacy in a particularly difficult area. This is the first time that speculative RCUK-funded clinical design research has matured through clinical trials to a manufactured product available commercially. The CareCentre was finalist in two categories at the Building Better Healthcare Awards 2012, and in the Patient Safety Awards 2013. The cluster-randomised crossover clinical trial was published as an abstract in the British Journal of Surgery (2012). West gave related presentations at the ‘Design & Health World Congress’, USA (2011), the ‘ 1 st European Conference on Design 4 Health’, UK (2011), the Institute for Healthcare ‘Improvement National Forum’, USA (2011) and the ‘Design of Medical Devices’ conference, USA (2013) ...|$|E
