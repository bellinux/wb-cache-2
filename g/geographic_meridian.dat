40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{local time}} (MLT) dependence of magnetic {{variations on the}} ground at mid-latitudes caused by field-aligned currents is estimated for two cases where the distribution of the field-aligned currents is defined at the magnetosphere and at the polar ionosphere. The results show that the MLT distribution of the magnetic variations shifts eastward or westward by a few hours in the latter case because the terrestrial magnetic field declines from the <b>geographic</b> <b>meridian.</b> Whether the distribution shifts eastward or westward depends on the longitude of the observatory. This fact suggests that whether the distribution of a phenomenon propagating along the terrestrial magnetic field is mainly determined in the magnetosphere or in the ionosphere may be determined by comparing the MLT distribution of the phenomenon 2 ̆ 7 s magnetic effect at observatories located at various longitudes...|$|E
3000|$|The EEJ {{runs along}} {{a major part}} of the {{geomagnetic}} equator around the world. However, due to the presence of a South Atlantic Anomaly, the EEJ deviates to the north between about 55 °W and 55 °E geographic longitude along the magnetic dip equator. This includes Africa, and it complicates the physical set-up of the inversion. Ideally, the inversion should be run over latitude space along a meridian. More accurately, it should be done over the space created along the direction perpendicular to the direction of the EEJ at the given meridian. This is not a true <b>geographic</b> <b>meridian,</b> but deviates a bit to the east. Because the geomagnetic observatories are on different geographic longitudes (as given in Table  1), a meridian position along the EEJ midway between the observatory positions was chosen: 39.115 °E. We found the geographic latitude of the EEJ at this longitude to be around 8.17 °N for Apex(epoch 2013.5) and 8.15 °N for IGRF(epoch 2013), by virtue of the fact that the geomagnetic vertical component and inclination must be zero (B [...]...|$|E
40|$|The article {{considers}} three-stage pendulum gyrocompass {{ground with}} torsion suspension unmanaged sensor, equipped with high-precision digital angle sensor azimuthal position sensor and information processing unit. During {{processing of information}} is used an indirect method to get facts about initial deviations of dynamical systems. In the process of improving the instrument have revealed that a further increasing of accuracy due to the necessity to consider the following factors. During the measurement around the vertical axis of the sensor operates permanent uncontrolled moment due to operational reasons are different from measurement to measurement. Specified point shifts the center of oscillation of the azimuthal sensor, which is {{in accordance with the}} procedure identified azimuth northerly direction on a constant value. For self-compensation of this error have been proposed several methods based on measurements with different but fixed parameters of the device. However, these measures have extended more than twice the measurement process. In this article there is proposing to define the position of the <b>geographic</b> <b>meridian</b> based on the analysis of the azimuthal motion sensor gyro during acceleration of its rotor. The proposal can bring dual gain in reducing measurement time: at first, the rotor becomes "staff" rather than ballast gyro operation mode, as it was before; secondly, {{there is no need for}} special measures to combat harmful vertical moments, as the shift of the equilibrium caused by the action of the latter, is variable in time, which allows to determine the magnitude of harmful moment during a single measurement. ??????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ??????????????? ????????? ????????????? ??????????? ???????????? ?? ????? ??????? ??? ??????. ????????? ?????? ????????? ??????????? ????????? ????? ??????????? ?????????, ?????????, ??-??????, ????? ??????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????, ? ?? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ???????????, ??? ??? ???? ?????, ? ??-??????, ???????? ????????????? ? ??????????? ????? ?????? ? ???????????????? ??????? ???????? ?????? ???????????? ??? ??????????????? ????????, ??? ??? ???????? ????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????????, ????????? ????????? ???????? ???????, ???????? ?????????? ?? ???????, ??? ????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ? ???????? ?????? ?????????. ??? ?????? ????????? ??????? ?????? ??????? ????????????? ????? ????????????? ???????? ??????????????? ????????, ??????? ????? ???? ??????? ? ?????? ????????? ????????? ??????????...|$|E

40|$|The cartographic work of Rigas Velestinlis, {{the major}} {{figure of the}} Greek Enlightenment and an activist of the Greek Resurgence {{in the late eighteenth}} century, is not well known in the interna-tional cartographic literature, despite the fact that his {{masterpiece}} the twelve-sheet Charta (1797) {{is one of the most}} interesting cartographic products of the period. The few existing relevant refer-ences in the non-Greek bibliography, almost exclusively in French, describe Charta mainly as an intellectual work rather than a real cartographic product, from the scientific and technological points of cartographic view.

In terms of minimized barriers and openness of the world, the inevitable {{process of the}} globalization and the business actions represent projects that are facing success potentials, as well as risk and failure potentials. The indisputable accent on these aspects is certainly the success and {{the reliability of the}} business ventures for which the ultimate goal is the economic satisfaction, minimizing the risks as well as the establishment of long-term experiences in order to maintain a particular enterprise in a particular environment. The participation on the world's global markets, the internationalization and the transfer of the business activities on all <b>geographic</b> <b>meridians,</b> encountering different and often uncertain environments is a constant business story of the international economic activity for at least three centuries ago. The global economic interaction is as old as it is old the society in its more or less organized form. From the industrial revolution until today, there is ongoing irreversible global economic integration. The reasons are simple, business and profits do not recognize borders, national and cultural unsurpassed characteristics, where more or less a mutual benefit of certain cooperation is recognized, a business connection is immediately established...|$|R
50|$|The ancient Greeks had {{discovered}} that a dark stone metal could attract or repel objects of iron. Was {{the origin of the}} study of magnetism. At the time of the great sailing, the navigators could not find a ship at sea by the two coordinates, latitude and longitude, the determination of this required a clock on board to indicate the exact time at the meridian of reference, and the astronomical determination of longitude gave unacceptable errors. During the trip to India, D. João de Castro has carried out a series of experiments that succeeded in detecting the phenomena, in particular related to magnetism and the magnetic needle on board. It should be assumed that such knowledge comes from Pedro Nunes, of course the direct inspiration of all the observations he has done in his travels. When on 5 August 1538, D. João de Castro decided to determine the latitude of Mozambique, found the cause that dictated the astonishing uneasiness of needles; noted the deviation of the needle, discovering it 128 years before Guillaume Dennis (1666) of Nieppe, which is recorded in history of sailing {{as if he were the}} first to know about this phenomenon. His observation near Baçaim, on 22 December 1538, of a magnetic phenomenon, for which there were variations of the needle because of the proximity of certain rocks, confirmed four centuries later, called local attraction. D. João de Castro refuted the theory that the variation of magnetic declination is not formed by <b>geographic</b> <b>meridians.</b>|$|R
