5|$|St Leonard's Tower {{is located}} {{on the edge of the}} village of West Malling, on a {{sandstone}} promontory, overlooking a valley leading <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> River Medway. The base of the tower rests directly on the rock, levelled up with masonry to form a plinth. The tower was probably originally surrounded by service buildings, possibly within a walled enclosure, part of which may survive in the stone wall running from the castle to the north-east.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} side of the Inner Ward is another barbican, {{enclosing}} the castle garden. This was overlooked by the royal apartments, and changed in style over the years: in the early 14th century there was a lawn, in the late 14th century vines, in the 16th century crab-apple trees and a lawn and in the 17th century formal ornamental flowers. A postern gate originally led <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> where a small dock was built, allowing key visitors to enter the castle in private and for the fortress to be resupplied by boat, although this gate is now concealed by the later bridges built on the site.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{building}} of Orford Castle, Suffolk was dominated by the Bigod family, who held {{the title of the}} Earl of Norfolk and owned key castles at Framlingham, Bungay, Walton and Thetford. Hugh Bigod had been {{one of a group of}} dissenting barons during the Anarchy in the reign of King Stephen, and Henry II wished to re-establish royal influence across the region. Henry confiscated the four castles from Hugh, but returned Framlingham and Bungay to Hugh in 1165. Henry then decided to build his own royal castle at Orford, near Framlingham, and construction work began in 1165, concluding in 1173. The Orford site was around two miles (3.2km) from the sea, lying on flat ground with swampy terrain slowly stretching away <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> Ore, about half a mile (0.8km) away.|$|E
50|$|The Wernradweg (“Wern Cycle Path”) is a 78 km-long cycle path {{running from}} the Wern’s source by way of Arnstein <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river’s</b> outflow into <b>the</b> Main near Gemünden-Wernfeld.|$|R
60|$|As if {{she were}} a part of the refuse it had cast out, and left to {{corruption}} and decay, the girl we had followed strayed <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river's</b> brink, and stood {{in the midst of this}} night-picture, lonely and still, looking at the water.|$|R
60|$|As {{through the}} {{preceding}} day, they journeyed on without finding, except in one instance, any {{place where they}} could get <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river's</b> edge, and they were fain <b>to</b> allay <b>the</b> thirst caused by hard travelling, with the water collected {{in the hollow of}} the rocks.|$|R
5|$|The use {{of water}} to {{extinguish}} the fire was also frustrated. In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via a reservoir of Hertfordshire spring water in Islington. It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to a hose to play on a fire or fill buckets. Further, Pudding Lane {{was close to the}} river. Theoretically, all the lanes from the river up to the bakery and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing full buckets up to the fire and empty buckets back <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b>|$|E
5|$|Conwy Castle hugs a rocky coastal {{ridge of}} grey {{sandstone}} and limestone, {{and much of}} the stone from the castle is largely taken from the ridge itself, probably when the site was first cleared. The castle has a rectangular plan and is divided into an inner and outer ward, with four large towers on each side. The main entrance to the castle is through the western barbican, an exterior defence in front of the main gate. The barbican features the earliest surviving stone machicolations in Britain. A postern gate originally led <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> where a small dock was built, allowing key visitors to enter the castle in private and for the fortress to be resupplied by boat. Conwy's outer ward was originally crowded with administrative and service buildings. The inner ward was separated from the outer by a wall, a drawbridge and a gate, protected by a ditch cut into the rock. Inside, it contained the chambers for the royal household, their immediate staff and service facilities. On {{the east side of the}} inner ward is another barbican, enclosing the castle garden.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} ripe for {{redevelopment}} by the landholding elite, {{who wished to}} have suitably grand townhouses to occupy while attending Parliament and the court. The vestiges of the Privy Garden became {{the site of a}} new street. In 1808 a row of houses called Whitehall Gardens was constructed on the site. Behind each house, long grassy gardens planted with rows of trees led directly <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> until they were cut off by the construction of the Victoria Embankment along the river bank between 1865 and 1870. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli lived in one of the houses between 1873 and 1875, while Sir Robert Peel lived in another (and died there in 1850 after falling from his horse on Constitution Hill). The trees outside the front entrance to Whitehall Gardens were the last survivors of the original Privy Garden, and stood until as recently as the late 1930s.|$|E

25|$|Wolfsberg. The walled town {{occupied}} {{both sides}} of the river Lavant in the Lavantal. The castle, mentioned in 1178 as ‘Wolfsperch’, was on an outcrop with walls stretching <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> On the W was the main portion of the town joined with a bridge over the Lavant. The town was the centre of the Archbishop of Bamberg’s estates in Carinthia and received a charter in 1331. The Merian print of 1679 shows {{the western part of the}} town with a N gate with a defensive bastion in front of it. It also shows a W gate and wall with round and square towers set into it, which was fronted by a wide water-filled ditch. Only one square tower, the Marterturm survives.|$|E
25|$|A well-made lane {{runs from}} Laigh Castleton <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Annick. The {{shape of the}} {{enclosure}} {{at the end of}} this road, the presence of piles of stones and what may have been a weir fairly conclusively show this to have been the site of a mill. The 1829 Robert Aitken's survey and the 1858 OS map indicates 'stepping stones' here (the old weir) and a ford a hundred metres or so upstream. A building is indicated, which may have been the grain store on the other side of the river, the ford would have provided easy access. A track from here, the grain store, to High Chapeltoun is shown on one of Aitken's maps. Ploughing in this field did not bring up any stones, suggesting that this was a wooden building.|$|E
25|$|About 1:30 PM on 8 August 1809, the 600 dragoons of General of Brigade Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt's brigade {{burst out}} of cover, trotted <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> bank, and splashed into the river. They rapidly navigated the deep part of the ford and soon reached the {{shallows}} on the south bank. The 1st Extremadura Hussar Regiment and an infantry battalion from the bridge defenders tried to oppose the French cavalry. Caulaincourt's troopers set upon the Spanish hussars and soon routed them. The victorious French horsemen regrouped and charged the infantry. With its adversaries galloping toward it, the battalion tried to form square, {{but was unable to}} close the rear face before the dragoons charged through the gap. As the square broke up, many Spanish foot soldiers were hewn down or surrendered.|$|E
