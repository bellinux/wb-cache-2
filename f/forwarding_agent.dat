2500|$|Born on Rottnest Island, Back {{played for}} Fremantle in the WACA grade cricket competition, {{and led the}} league's batting averages during the 1887–88 season, scoring 267 runs from ten innings {{at an average of}} 53.50. His only state-level matches played during Western Australia's tour of the eastern colonies in early 1893. He opened the batting for the side in both of its two {{first-class}} matches on the tour, against South Australia and Victoria, variously partnering with Percival Hussey, Harry Bennett, and Ernest Randell. In the first match, Back scored four and seven runs, and in the second match, a duck and one run, with Western Australia following on in both matches. He also played in two other matches on tour, against the Melbourne Cricket Club and a [...] "juniors" [...] representative team from Victoria. Little else is known of his life. Having apparently worked as a <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent</b> on the Fremantle wharves, Back died in Fremantle on 15 February 1911, and was buried in the Anglican section of Fremantle Cemetery the following day. He {{had been a member of}} a local fraternal organisation, the Oddfellows, before his death, as well as a founding member of the Fremantle District Cricket Club, who wore black armbands in their next match.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} transfer {{points for}} mail arriving from or destined to Europe and other locations were Nassau in the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Cuba. Ships carrying letters that were addressed to {{points in the}} Confederacy would deposit their cargo of mail {{at one of these}} transfer points. Here the inbound mail was handled by a <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent</b> who would remove the mail or inner cover and prepare it for transfer on a blockade runner. [...] Often the forwarding agents would apply their own markings to the cover of mail. Mail placed aboard a blockade runner would then, perhaps with some luck, make its way to the ports of New Orleans, Charleston or Wilmington, where it was received by Confederate postal operators who would then include it in with the regular Confederate mail for delivery. [...] The captain of the blockade runner would typically get two cents for every letter he delivered to port, which was a nominal sum, as his main source of revenue was from delivering his cargo. The average number of successful runs by a blockade runner was only about four, many of them meeting a fateful ending on their first run. Various ports along the coastline of the Confederacy saw the most traffic from blockade runners. Charleston in South Carolina was particularly well situated as a port for blockade runners with their shallow drafts, as was the Port in Wilmington in North Carolina which saw the most traffic. Because the lower Mississippi River was being blockaded effectively dividing the Western Confederate states from those east, New Orleans became one of the busiest of ports. Consequently, many blockade covers have postmarks from these locations.|$|E

When that <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent,</b> Mr. Aston, {{knew that}} we were in the town, he {{came to me and said}} that he had about fifty cases full of {{something}} heavy, as he supposed samples of ore, addressed to me to your care in England which he was proposing to ship on by the Benin. I answered 'Yes, that was all right,' and did not undeceive him about their contents. Then I asked how they had arrived, and if he had not received a letter with them. He replied that one morning before the warehouse was open, some natives had brought them down in a canoe, and dumped them at the door, telling the watchman that they had been paid to deliver them there by some other natives whom they met a long way up the river. Then they went away without leaving any letter or message. Well, I thanked Aston and paid his charges and there's an end of the matter. Those fifty-three cases are now in the hold invoiced as ore samples and, as I inspected them myself and am sure that they have not been tampered with, besides the value of the necklace the Asika gave me we've got £100,000 to begin our married life upon with something over for old Jeekie, and I daresay we shall do very well on that." ...|$|E
