Dalmatia and Istria <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> culinary influences of Italian and other Mediterranean cuisines which prominently feature various seafood, cooked vegetables and pasta, {{as well as}} condiments such as olive oil and garlic. The continental cuisine is heavily influenced by Hungarian, Austrian and Turkish culinary styles. In that area, meats, freshwater fish and vegetable dishes are predominant.|$|E
5|$|In late 2011, the FAA {{assigned}} a common type rating to the 787 and 777, allowing pilots qualified on either aircraft to operate both models, due to related design features. The smaller 787 {{was the first}} stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project. Reportedly, the 777 could eventually be replaced by a new aircraft family, Yellowstone 3, which would <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> technologies from the 787.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{literature}} and science fiction have put forward various {{models of the}} ways in which extraterrestrial and human civilizations might interact. Their predictions range widely, from sophisticated civilizations that could advance human civilization in many areas to imperial powers that might <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> the forces necessary to subjugate humanity. Some theories suggest that an extraterrestrial civilization could be advanced enough to dispense with biology, living instead inside of advanced computers.|$|E

Using computer simulations, artificial intelligence, text mining, complex statistical methods, and new analytic approaches like {{social network analysis}} and social sequence analysis, computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through bottom-up modelling of social interactions.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{after the}} war {{he worked as a}} bank clerk and later as a journalist. During this time he began writing plays and poetry. In 1941 Roa Bastos won the Ateneo Paraguayo prize for Fulgencia Miranda, {{although}} the book was never published. In the early 1940s he spent significant time on the yerba mate plantations in northern Paraguay, an experience he would later <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> in his first published novel, Hijo de hombre (1960; Son of Man). In 1942 he was appointed editorial secretary for the Asunción daily El País.|$|E
5|$|Mahaleo is a folk-pop {{band from}} Madagascar that is {{widely viewed as}} the most popular Malagasy group of all time. The band was founded by Dama (Rasolofondraosolo Zafimahaleo) with six of his classmates after first {{performing}} together during the rotaka student protests at their high school on 13 May 1972. Mahaleo's lyrics <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> the indirect language of traditional hainteny and ohabolana (Malagasy poetry and proverbs) to expose contemporary political and social issues and invite listeners to identify their own solutions.|$|E

5|$|Taraborrelli {{decided to}} focus on the singer's private life; who she really was. Many books about the superstar were based on {{previously}} published material, but Taraborrelli had ten years of research to <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> including interviews with people who had not spoken about Madonna in public and his own interviews with the icon. Taraborrelli and his team of private investigators interviewed Madonna's close friends, business associates, and family members including her father Silvio Ciccone.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} social {{scientific}} methods has also expanded. Social researchers <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-twentieth century led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of society. Conversely, {{the end of the}} 1990s and the beginning of 2000s have seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli's time as {{the pastor}} of Glarus and Einsiedeln was {{characterized}} by inner growth and development. He perfected his Greek and he took up the study of Hebrew. His library contained over three hundred volumes from which {{he was able to}} <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> classical, patristic, and scholastic works. He exchanged scholarly letters with a circle of Swiss humanists and began to study the writings of Erasmus. Zwingli took the opportunity to meet him while Erasmus was in Basel between August 1514 and May 1516. Zwingli's turn to relative pacifism and his focus on preaching {{can be traced to the}} influence of Erasmus.|$|E

He also <b>drew</b> <b>upon</b> Plutarch's Lives, and perhaps Lucian's Dialogues and a lost comedy on the subject of Timon, allusions to which survive from 1584.|$|R
5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could <b>draw</b> <b>upon,</b> the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Pierre Christin was {{dividing}} {{his time between}} Paris and Bordeaux, where {{he was working on}} founding the school of journalism at the Institut Universitaire de Technologie (IUT). Meeting up with Mézières one day, Christin suggested that they work on creating a comic strip together. Both had their experiences in the American West to <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> but felt, thanks to Lucky Luke, Jerry Spring and Blueberry, that the market for Westerns was already crowded. Instead, Christin suggested that they turn their hands to science fiction, a genre that, at that time, was not prevalent in French comics. Although Goscinny was not a science fiction fan, he wanted to promote innovation and originality in Pilote and so commissioned them to produce a strip.|$|E
5|$|Heathen festivals {{can be held}} on {{the same}} day each year, {{although}} they are often celebrated by Heathen communities on the nearest available weekend, so that those practitioners who work during the week can attend. During these ceremonies, Heathens often recite poetry to honor the deities, which typically <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> or imitate the Early Medieval poems written in Old Norse or Old English. Mead or ale is also typically drunk, with offerings being given to deities, while fires, torches, or candles are often lit. There are also regional meetings of Heathens known as Things. At these, religious rites are performed, while workshops, stalls, feasts, and competitive games are also present. In the U.S., there are two national gatherings, Althing and Trothmoot.|$|E

5|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{developed}} {{the concept of}} jutsu in order to explain the superhuman feats that ninja performed in the Naruto series. He intended the design for the ninja in Naruto to dispel preconceived notions about ninja popularized by other manga and to bring an original take to the presentation of ninja in manga. The use of hand seals substitutes for the incantations for magic found in other sources, and {{was based on the}} motions of ninja in various role-playing games. The hand seals are based upon the characters of the Chinese zodiac, which is a longstanding tradition in Japan, and Kishimoto used them specifically to <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> that tradition.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} the {{formation}} of the 4th Brigade in England, in response to a request made by the British War Office to the New Zealand government for another infantry division. Although their numbers were insufficient for a new division, personnel from New Zealand were arriving in the various NZEF depots in Europe at a much higher rate than they were being lost from the division due to casualties and attrition. By early 1917, there was a reserve of around 10,000 men available with which to <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> for the new brigade without adversely affecting the ability to replace existing troops in the field, in the short term at least. The brigade's core units were four infantry battalions designated as the 3rd Battalions of the Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury and Otago Regiments. Newly promoted Brigadier General Herbert Ernest Hart was appointed by Godley as the brigade's commander, and after a rigorous training programme, curtailed by orders to report to France, it embarked for the front on 29 May 1917. With four infantry brigades, the New Zealand Division was now the strongest Dominion formation fighting in France with 20,000 personnel. However, Russell did not like his division's four-brigade structure (the remainder of the British and Dominion infantry divisions had three brigades) as he continually had to fend off requests to use the extra brigade for labouring work in the corps rear area.|$|E
