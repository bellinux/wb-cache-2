40|$|The {{notion of}} a European Monetary Union can be {{interpreted}} in different ways. To most non-economists it probably implies a single European currency and a European central bank. To economists, however, a monetary union implies only (in {{the words of the}} 1970 Werner Plan) : 'the irrevocable fixing of parities and the total liberalization of capital movements'. To others still a monetary union might be reached if there is a widely used <b>European</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>currency.</b> This article argues that these paradigms imply different degrees of monetary integration, and that the benefits that can be expected from a monetary union for Europe depend on the degree of monetary integration. Which paradigm should be chosen, therefore, depends on the reasons for which a monetary union for Europe is deemed desirable. Copyright 1989 BPL. ...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} report IDEAS explores the current euro crisis {{by looking at}} the debates preceding the conception of the euro. How can the early days of EU monetary cooperation help us understand today's predicament? And what lessons can we draw from them for the euro? Emmanuel Mourlon-Druol is Pinto Fellow at LSE IDEAS. Today's debates about the viability of the eurozone bear a striking resemblance with those about the creation of a European single currency in the late twentieth century. The early steps of European monetary cooperation, the negotiations over the creation of the European Monetary System (EMS), those over the creation of the euro, {{as well as the other}} plans suggested which eventually failed (the proposal for a <b>European</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>currency</b> for instance), help us better understand the challenges that the euro faces today. Many of the issues at stake then are indeed still central to debates now. The question of the transfer of resources from richer to poorer member states, the adoption of a German-inspired interpretation of monetary policy, to take but two examples, are issues that anyone reading today's newspapers will be familiar with. This paper argues that looking at these past debates do not just provide an insight into the past – but also helps us better understand our current predicament...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to reappraise the European Community's {{progress}} towards Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and to set out the lessons which {{can be derived from}} this experience and from economic and political theory with regard to the kind of strategy which must be followed to achieve EMU in Europe. It compares the three monetary systems, Bretton Woods, the Snake and the EMS, which account for the development of European monetary relations in the post-war period and tries to explore the parallels and their respective strengths and weaknesses, to draw conclusions as to the conditions which are necessary for the successful operation of an adjustable-peg type of exchange rate system and to assess the chances of such a system to achieve full and permanent EMU in the Community. It looks into the economic and the political factors which account for the successes and failures so far, their relevance today, {{as well as some of}} the interconnections that exist between EMU and integration in other fields. The thesis concludes that the EEC has as yet failed to make the decisive break towards monetary union because the full implications of EMU and the commitment necessary to achieve it have not been understood or accepted by Europe's national governments. The co-ordination approach to EMU, which has underpinned the Community's efforts in this direction from the early 1960 s to the recent Delors proposals has been an inappropriate one for the task. The best way to achieve EMU in the Community, especially given the dramatic developments in Eastern Europe, is through the creation of a <b>European</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>currency</b> which would depoliticise monetary policy and would allow EMU to be implemented at a pace dictated by Europe's need for it, rather than by the twists and turns of national politics. Finally, the firm belief is stated that true EMU can only be realised within the framework of a federal Europe...|$|E
40|$|A {{plan for}} European Monetary Union was {{recently}} proposed {{based on the}} issue of a <b>parallel</b> <b>European</b> <b>currency,</b> the acceptance of which would be established by a market process, not by official edicts and which would be managed to achieve stable European-wide prices. This paper examines the desirability of, and problems associated with this particular approach. It represents yet a further attempt to show that the anti-union arguments are either wrong or they are positive, not normative propositions which lead to the prediction that union will not occur and do not lead to the prescription that it shouldn’t. The inflation records of the individual countries are first examined and the reasons for national differences in that rate are analysed. Then the implications of monetary union are analysed. Finally, the political objections to monetary union are considered. JEL: F 36, F 33 </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction [...] . ] To {{make the}} topic {{accessible}} to a bachelor thesis, {{and prevent the}} discussion from becoming too superficial, only a few representative <b>parallel</b> <b>currency</b> systems will be considered here. The second and third chapter will begin {{with a discussion of}} <b>parallel</b> <b>currencies</b> and currency competition throughout ancient, medieval, and modern Europe. Comparing the monetary history of Ancient Greece and Rome will illustrate the virtues of competing <b>parallel</b> <b>currencies.</b> A discussion of imaginary money' in medieval Europe will show that separation of the functions of money is a common feature of monetary history. The fourth chapter will look into flexible domestic exchange rates in China and Japan between the 17 th and 19 th century. The Chinese experience will demonstrate parallel currencies' ability to discover the boundaries of optimum currency areas, while the Japanese case will show how separating the functions of money can help protect agents from the detrimental effects of debasements. In the fourth chapter, the introduction of <b>parallel</b> paper <b>currencies</b> in America, such as the continentals and greenbacks, will be considered. These issues usually failed {{due to a lack of}} trust in the issuing authorities, illustrating the difficulties of introducing a weak <b>parallel</b> <b>currency.</b> Finally, the fifth chapter will discuss the role of stable and indexed <b>parallel</b> <b>currencies</b> as tools of monetary reform during hyperinflations - namely, the rentenmark in the German hyperinflation of 1932 and the tax peng 6 in the Hungarian hyperinflation of 1945 / 46. The conclusion will discuss the differences and communalities between the historical episodes. Last but not least, some tentative conclusions regarding the relevance of historical experience for the introduction of <b>parallel</b> <b>currencies</b> in the Eurozone will be drawn...|$|R

The magnitude of the premium, which has implications for economic performance, varies among countries and over time in the same country. Drawing on the literature, the paper develops a model which integrates the flow and portfolio motives for holding <b>parallel</b> <b>currency</b> on the demand side and a supply equation that recognizes the dependence of the supply of foreign exchange on the <b>parallel</b> <b>currency</b> premium, {{with a view to}} identify the primary economic determinants of the latter in select African countries.

40|$|The recent {{financial}} and economic crisis {{led to a}} deepening of fiscal problems in many countries all over the world. European countries were also hit hard by the economic downturn. The critical situation in Greece and its {{negative impact on the}} economic situation in the whole Euro zone has brought up many questions about the rigidity and functionality of the euro concept. A majority of economists and politicians support the idea of saving the Euro zone since the break up would be quite costly. There are many ideas regarding a solution to the current situation, {{and one of the most}} radical is the introduction of a <b>parallel</b> <b>currency</b> in the states which are trapped in the debt crisis. The aim of the thesis is to take a critical look at the historical development of different approaches to this theme with a focus on theories based on the devaluation as the solution. The <b>parallel</b> <b>currency</b> theory is compared to Euro zone break-up scenario and hard restructuring option and the positives and negatives of each approach are analysed. Finaly the simulation on the Greeek case is performed to prove or diproved the positive effects of <b>parallel</b> <b>currency</b> establishment.

40|$|Exchange {{restrictions}} are generally observed in externally-indebted, noncreditworthy countries with depleting international reserves, and a foreign trade structure which is presumably nonresponsive to nominal exchange rate changes. To {{the proponents of}} exchange restrictions, administrative-based allocation of a scarce resource is a viable economic option for countries that absorb external financial resources primarily {{in the form of}} official transfers. To the opponents of exchange restrictions, administrative-based methods of allocating reserves encourage <b>parallel</b> <b>currency</b> transactions. The incentives provided by the parallel premium have adverse resource allocation implications and welfare consequences. The model developed in this dissertation uses a general equilibrium framework to highlight the links between the goods market and the money market {{in a country where the}} foreign exchange market is bifurcated into an official and a <b>parallel</b> <b>currency</b> market. ^ Unlike in countries with market-based methods of allocating reserves—fixed or flexible, adjustment to excess demand pressures in nonunified systems occurs through changes which have real and monetary consequences. These changes include changes in the parallel premium, a depreciating home <b>currency</b> in the <b>parallel</b> market and loss of reserves. ^ The theoretical predictions are tested with quarterly data for India using time-series data. The chosen time frame witnessed a distinct shift in strategy in India from inward-orientation to outward-orientation. The model is also estimated for two distinct sub-periods to examine if the policy changes have significantly impacted India 2 ̆ 7 s <b>parallel</b> <b>currency</b> market. The results of the study are analyzed for drawing general policy inferences. ^ Exchange {{restrictions are}} not effective for realizing the intended objectives. Such restrictions encourage economic-rent seeking activities which entail social welfare loss.

40|$|In a {{surprisingly}} {{growing number of}} regions in Germany private "regional currencies" are issued as a cash substitute for the euro. Currently, these regional currencies are conceived almost exclusively as Schwundgeld (depreciative currency), which loses value on a predetermined timescale.

The paper shows that the issuance of unofficial <b>parallel</b> <b>currencies</b> is not a fundamentally new phenomenon neither in Germany nor in other European countries. The theoretical assumptions of the Schwundgeld concept (Silvio Gesell (1862 – 1930)) are highly flawed and suboptimal from a welfare-theoretical perspective. However, the current economic welfare losses resulting from the issuance of Schwundgeld are negligibly small.
