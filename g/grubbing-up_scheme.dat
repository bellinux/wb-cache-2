The latest reform of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for wine took effect on August the 1 st 2008 and introduced, among many initiatives oriented towards enhancing the competitiveness of the wine sector, a new voluntary three-year <b>grubbing-up</b> <b>scheme</b> from the 2008 / 2009 season, achieving a balanced wine market, reducing surplus production and providing an alternative for uncompetitive producers. This new policy is therefore mainly directed to increase product quality, as demanded from both domestic and foreign markets, without neglecting aspects relating to environmental safeguard in wine regions. Even grapevine nursery sector had been involved in guidelines set out in the new CMO for wine. This new regulatory framework, aiming to strengthen the entire chain, requires propagating material both with genetic-sanitary certification and consistent with recent market trends; in this meaning, it’s important to take account of either market signs concerning the varietal choices and the need to renew vineyards which have {{come to the end of}} their natural and economic life. Graft nursery activity, in fact, is closely correlated with wine market trend, both in terms of quantity and mainly quality, in relation to the meaning and the contents that the consumer assigns to the beverage "wine" (commodity, brand or private label, image or terroir, a mix of the three). However, it is common knowledge that market trends are unpredictable, just as consumer tastes can change abruptly; consequently, the market demand for propagating material is characterized by randomness too. Therefore, on planning the grapevine nursery production a key role is played on the one hand by nurserymen -on behalf of their knowledge of market trends, their experience, and their instinct too-, and on the other hand by the very specific combination of variety, clone and rootstock chosen by entrepreneurs depending on what will fit the profile of the their wine and what may fit their business requirement in the best way. The recently increased prestige of Sicilian viticulture and wines, the remarkable technical and managerial skills of entrepreneurs and the favourable climatic and soil environment, exert a positive influence on Sicilian graft nursery activity that takes on the meaning of an important economic activity. According to the latest available data (V General Census of Agriculture, 2000), this activity represents 12. 1...|$|E
5000|$|After the {{realisation}} {{that the}} surplus was a structural one {{rather than a}} temporary variation, the wine regulations were changed to be more interventionist in 1978, with a ban on additional vineyard plantations, which means that a system of planting rights was introduced to regulate replantations. Also, requirements to distil the surplus wine into industrial alcohol were introduced, a procedure {{often referred to as}} [...] "emergency distillation", although it has remained in force for decades. At about the same time, domestic wine consumption of simpler wine qualities started to drop within the larger wine producing countries of Europe, making it even harder to return to the previous state of market equilibrium. From the 1980s, this has meant a marked reduction in the total demand, in terms of quantity, {{despite the fact that the}} wine-importing countries of northern Europe have increased their consumption. Increasing wine exports from the New World, often in a style arrived at by market research rather than long tradition, also meant increased competition and changing tastes among wine consumers. As a result, the reduced total demand also included a shift in the demand towards higher quality level. Since it was realised that the vineyards in some locations would be unlikely to yield wines of the necessary quality, increased financial incentives for giving up vineyards, so-called <b>grubbing-up</b> <b>schemes</b> or vine pull schemes, were introduced in the late 1980s. This led to reduced overproduction, but a complete balance has so far never been achieved.|$|R
