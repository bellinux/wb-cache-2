Since then, the gravity method has been extensively used for outlining various geological structures. A series of typical applications of this method is discussed by Heiland (1940, p. 157) Because of the relatively high density contrast between rock and ice, {{gravimetric measurements}} have been used recently for determining subglacial <b>elevation</b> <b>contours.</b> This application of gravity measurements possibly originated with the Expeditions Polaires Francaises.

50|$|Swales {{as used in}} {{permaculture}} {{are designed}} to slow and capture runoff by spreading it horizontally across the landscape (along an <b>elevation</b> <b>contour</b> line), facilitating runoff infiltration into the soil. This type of swale is created by digging a ditch on contour and piling the dirt on the downhill side of the ditch to create a berm. In arid climates, vegetation (existing or planted) along the swale can benefit from the concentration of runoff. Trees and shrubs along the swale can provide shade which decreases water evaporation, however they increase transpiration, so their net effect on the hydrologic cycle is probably to reduce infiltration.|$|E

50|$|In {{structural}} geology, a homocline or homoclinal structure, (from old homo = same, cline = inclination) is a geological {{structure in}} which the bedding of a sequence of rock strata, either sedimentary or igneous, dips uniformly in a single direction having the same general inclination in terms of direction and angle. A homocline {{can be associated with}} either one limb of a fold, the edges of a dome, the coast-ward tilted strata underlying a coastal plain, slice of thrust fault, or a tilted fault block. When the homoclinal strata consists of alternating beds of rock that vary hardness and resistance to erosion, their erosion produces either cuestas, homoclinal ridges, or hogbacks depending on the angle of dip of the strata. On a topographic map, the landfroms associated with homoclines exhibit nearly parallel <b>elevation</b> <b>contour</b> lines that show a steady change in elevation in a given direction. In the subsurface, they characterize by parallel structural contour lines.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} based on two {{geographical}} datasets, namely, Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) <b>elevation</b> and <b>contour</b> <b>elevation.</b> The SRTM data is available for all locations in Sri Lanka. It follows {{the shape of the}} actual ground but not the actual elevation of the surface. This is due to errors introduced during processing. The contour data is obtained from the actual ground survey data of contour maps and using ArcGIS software. The survey data is more reliable, but more expensive. Since it does not contain ground level variations, Sri Lanka does not have <b>contour</b> <b>elevations</b> at all locations. Measuring <b>contour</b> <b>elevation</b> for all locations is a costly procedure. Therefore, finding a method to evaluate the approximated value of <b>contour</b> <b>elevation</b> with a less costly method is essential. Thus the objective {{of this study is to}} find a statistical model to predict the <b>contour</b> <b>elevation</b> based on SRTM data. Both types of data are available only for four locations: Paddhiruppu, Kegalle, Badulla, and Katharagama, in Sri Lanka. According to the geography of Sri Lanka, three clusters are distinguishable by elevation. These are the Central Highlands, the Plains, and the Coastal belt. Since the data used in this study are for four different locations and these locations fall into three different clusters, three regression models are fitted for each cluster and the models are validated. Multiple, linear regression analysis is used to fit the models. The t- test is used to test the significance of parameters while the F- test is used to test the significance of the overall model. Residual analysis is carried out to test the normality, homoscedasticity and auto correlation of the residuals. The goodness of the fitted model is evaluated by the coefficient of determination   2 R. Approximately 99 % of the variation is explained by the fitted models and 82 % by the validated model. Thus, if the SRTM data value is known, by choosing the appropriate model based on its cluster, the approximated <b>contour</b> <b>elevation</b> could be predicted...|$|R
