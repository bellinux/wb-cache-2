40|$|Following {{substantial}} {{discoveries of}} natural gas in recent years, Tanzania has new options for economic development. The country's policy makers are faced with having {{to make decisions about}} how best to utilize the gas in order to drive economic development The options before the government are whether to export the gas or to use it domestically. Exporting natural gas can be a very lucrative source of government revenues which can in turn be invested in improving education, access to healthcare or other areas to improve the general and economic well-being of the populace. Encouraging domestic use on the other hand may not be as lucrative in terms of government revenues, but is necessary for increasing participation along the gas value chain in particular and stimulating in other sectors of the economy that benefit from easy access to gas or its downstream products. In this study, I considered the options of using the gas in the production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) intended for export, as well the domestic manufacture of urea and electricity. I used a scenario analysis model to investigate and assess these options according to their direct economic value as well as their revenue generating potential. These two parameters were chosen as proxies for and economic growth and government ability to invest in public goods respectively. As part of the assessments carried out, special attention was paid to the different scenarios associated with meeting the government's national electrification plans as determined by their electricity demand forecasts. The results show that among the options considered, <b>domestic</b> <b>utilization</b> of the gas for power production will have greatest economic value while LNG exports hold the highest revenue potential. Furthermore, they demonstrate that even though using the natural gas for electricity production would be the most valuable option for the Tanzanian economy per unit of gas, allowing new generating capacity to be dominated by gas plants as has been done in some other gas rich countries would not be economically prudent. Instead a mix of technologies will provide the best balance between stimulating domestic gas consumption and providing cost effective electricity to consumers. Importantly, I find that future policy must ensure that <b>domestic</b> <b>utilization</b> of gas is not sacrificed in favor of exports even if it means reduced government revenues. by Ekenedilinna Umeike.

Particularly {{in view of}} access to essential medicines the TRIPS agreement permits countries to overwrite patent exclusivity in isolated cases and compulsory license a domestic manufacturer. Subsequently, export of compulsory licensed drugs was authorized {{to account for the}} lack in appropriate drug production capabilities of least developed countries. So far, this cross border compulsory licensing was used only once, in contrast to numerous <b>domestic</b> <b>utilizations.</b> While literature highlights political pressure and threads to foreign direct investment as general barriers for compulsory licensing the question remains why only least developed countries do not make use of this instrument. The work at hand contributes to the debate by identifying a discrimination of least developed countries which roots in the mechanics induced by the compulsory licensing process itself. A private generic manufacturer would not sell a compulsory licensed drug at marginal costs but determine the optimal duopoly competition price for a given structure of demand. Since potential licensees apply for compulsory licensing the optimal price is overwritten by negotiations and usually reduced signicantly. This does not hold for least developed countries seeking cross border compulsory licensing because the sequence of price bids and decision is dierent. As a result, cross border compulsory licensing loses its appeal, further reduced by royalty and transportation cost eects on the generic price...|$|R

40|$|The food {{transition}} {{process is}} now occurring {{much more quickly}} in developing countries than in developed nations, where it took over {{more than a century}} to achieve it. Two essential consequences of this process are a switch in the <b>domestic</b> <b>utilization</b> of cereals from human consumption to feeding of livestock and a much greater growth rate of meat and milk production today in developing countries than in developed nations. However, many developing countries continue to consume more animal products than they produce, and hence, are still dependent on imports for satisfying their increasing needs. They depend on trade not only directly through imports of animals and animal products, but also indirectly through imports of cereals and oilseeds for animal feed. The prospects are that the developing world will continue to drive world demand for all agricultural products, including animal products, in the next decades, and agricultural trade should increase. Current trends and future prospects raise the issue of how to ensure access to international and regional agricultural markets and stabilize food prices. This is exacerbated by the fact that exports, more specifically exports in animals and animal products, are highly concentrated among a few key players.

Therefore, the modelling of long-term renewable and <b>domestic</b> coal <b>utilization</b> is examined in terms of expansion cost and environmental impacts. The results show that in 2030, the required electricity generation to fulfil future demand is estimated 162 TWh. Under the BAU scenario, the share of coal is 33 % of total electricity generation mix. However, under the null coal import scenario the installed power plant from renewable sources increase to be 47 GW and coal utilization decreases to be 35 GW or 16 % of total electricity generation share.
