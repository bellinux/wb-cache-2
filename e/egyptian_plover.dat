25|$|Crocodiles {{have the}} most acidic stomach of any vertebrate. They can easily digest bones, hooves and horns. The BBC TV {{reported}} that a Nile crocodile that has lurked a long time underwater to catch prey builds up a large oxygen debt. When it has caught and eaten that prey, it closes its right aortic arch and uses its left aortic arch to flush blood loaded with carbon dioxide from its muscles directly to its stomach; the resulting excess acidity in its blood supply makes it much easier for the stomach lining to secrete more stomach acid to quickly dissolve bulks of swallowed prey flesh and bone. Many large crocodilians swallow stones (called gastroliths or stomach stones), which may act as ballast to balance their bodies or assist in crushing food, similar to grit ingested by birds. Herodotus claimed that Nile crocodiles had a symbiotic relationship with certain birds, such as the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>plover,</b> which enter the crocodile's mouth and pick leeches feeding on the crocodile's blood; with no evidence of this interaction actually occurring in any crocodile species, it is most likely mythical or allegorical fiction.|$|E
500|$|Ancient {{historians have}} {{described}} crocodilians {{from the earliest}} historical records, though often their descriptions contain as much legend as fact. The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus (c. 440 BC) described the crocodile in detail, though much of his description is fanciful; he claimed that it would lie with its mouth open to permit a [...] "trochilus" [...] bird (possibly an <b>Egyptian</b> <b>plover)</b> to enter and remove any leeches it found. The crocodile {{was one of the}} beasts described in the late-13th century Rochester Bestiary, based on classical sources, including Pliny's Historia naturalis (c. 79 AD) and Isidore of Seville's Etymologies. Isidore asserts that the crocodile is named for its saffron colour (Latin croceus, 'saffron'), and that it is often twenty cubits (...) long. He further claimed that the crocodile may be killed by fish with serrated crests sawing into its soft underbelly, and that the male and female take turns guarding the eggs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{technique}} {{used to construct}} a scrape nest varies slightly depending on the species. Beach-nesting terns, for instance, fashion their nests by rocking their bodies on the sand in the place they have chosen to site their nest, while skimmers build their scrapes with their feet, kicking sand backwards while resting on their bellies and turning slowly in circles. [...] The ostrich also scratches out its scrape with its feet, though it stands while doing so. Many tinamous lay their eggs on a shallow mat of dead leaves they have collected and placed under bushes or between the root buttresses of trees, and kagus lay theirs {{on a pile of}} dead leaves against a log, tree trunk or vegetation. [...] Marbled godwits stomp a grassy area flat with their feet, then lay their eggs, while other grass-nesting waders bend vegetation over their nests so as to avoid detection from above. Many female ducks, particularly in the northern latitudes, line their shallow scrape nests with down feathers plucked from their own breasts, as well as with small amounts of vegetation. [...] Among scrape-nesting birds, the three-banded courser and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>plover</b> are unique in their habit of partially burying their eggs in the sand of their scrapes.|$|E
25|$|Bird World, {{opened in}} 1975, {{features}} open aviaries in which guests can mingle with exotic birds such as <b>Egyptian</b> <b>plovers,</b> rhinoceros hornbills, and crested oropendolas and even two-toed sloths. Each area features naturalistic habitats and replicated tropic and aquatic ecosystems, with three major exhibits built without barriers so the birds can fly freely among zoo visitors. At the Bird World kitchen viewing window, visitors can see firsthand what the birds eat. There are four outdoor exhibits directly {{attached to the}} exterior of Bird World which are home to African penguins, Steller's sea eagles, kea and double-wattled cassowaries.|$|R
30|$|In {{comparison}} to historical economic thought, {{which has been}} deeply influenced by physics, terminologies such as “business ecosystem” and “symbiotic patterns of business alliances” invoke distinctively different attributes to explain the birth of firms and industries. To explain the birth of firms or startup ventures, biology and population ecology are theoretically applied to describe a system as a business ecosystem. An analytical framework for inter-organizational relations was proposed by Astley and Fombrun (1983) and Astley (1984). They proposed an approach called the collective strategy that incorporated the population ecology concept of symbiotic relationships. They applied the adjective “commensalistic” in their research, believing {{that the concept of}} symbiotic relationships could be applied to corporate strategy. In ecology, commensalism (Vandermeer and Goldberg 2003) is a situation in which one organism benefits from another without either being harmed, for example, the relationship between crocodiles and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>plovers.</b> To date, the concept of commensalism in collective strategy has been applied in the literature of management strategy (Bresser and Harl 1986; Bresser 1988; Dollinger 1990; Haak 2004). Rigorous empirical studies of this concept, however, have yet to be presented.|$|R

50|$|Protocooperation {{can occur}} in birds. The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>plover</b> removes insect pests from the backs of buffalo, antelope, giraffes, and rhinos. The cattle egret in America as well does the same task of {{removing}} the unwanted insects and parasites.|$|E
5000|$|Glareolidae [...] is {{a family}} of birds in the wader {{suborder}} Charadri. It contains two distinct groups, the pratincoles and the coursers.

However, Guggisberg (1972) had seen examples of birds picking scraps of meat from the teeth of basking crocodiles (without entering the mouth) and prey from soil very near basking crocodiles, so felt it was not impossible that a bold, hungry bird may occasionally nearly enter a crocodile’s mouth but not likely as an habitual behaviour.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{phylogeny}} of shorebirds (Aves: Charadriiformes) {{and their}} putative sister groups was reconstructed using approximately 5 kilobases {{of data from}} three nuclear loci and two mitochondrial genes, and compared to that based on two other nuclear loci. Results Charadriiformes represent a monophyletic group that consists of three monophyletic suborders Lari (i. e., Laridae [including Sternidae and Rynchopidae], Stercorariidae, Alcidae, Glareolidae, Dromadidae, and Turnicidae), Scolopaci (i. e., Scolopacidae [including Phalaropidae], Jacanidae, Rostratulidae, Thinocoridae, Pedionomidae), and Charadrii (i. e., Burhinidae, Chionididae, Charadriidae, Haematopodidae, Recurvirostridae, and presumably Ibidorhynchidae). The position of purported "gruiform" buttonquails within Charadriiformes is confirmed. Skimmers are most likely sister to terns alone, and plovers may be paraphyletic with respect to oystercatchers and stilts. The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>Plover</b> is {{not a member of}} the Glareolidae, but is instead relatively basal among Charadrii. None of the putative sisters of Charadriiformes were recovered as such. Conclusion Hypotheses of non-monophyly and sister relationships of shorebirds are tested by multilocus analysis. The monophyly of and interfamilial relationships among shorebirds are confirmed and refined. Lineage-specific differences in evolutionary rates are more consistent across loci in shorebirds than other birds and may contribute to the congruence of locus-specific phylogenetic estimates in shorebirds. </p...|$|E
40|$|How does, and how should, a {{librarian}} look at publishing in 1967 ? As a minor customer buying {{a small part}} of the output of a large industry? As a fellow member of the nation's communications apparatus ? As one of the last of the Mohicans upon whom the tribe of McLuhanites is about to count coup? Is the librarian like one of a boatload of frantic voyagers in immediate danger of drowning in a roaring river of print loosed by publishers? Or may librarians and publishers be thought of as linked in a symbiotic relationship like that of the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>plover</b> and the crocodile? The plover helps the crocodile as lookout and oral hygienist. In return he gets the delicious leeches he finds along the crocodile's gums. Both partners benefit. However one describes the publisher -librarian relationship it is obvious we each have important functions in the series of processes from the writing of a book to its publishing, and on to its selection, acquisition and presentation to the reader.

40|$|Comparative {{study of}} {{character}} {{evolution in the}} shorebirds is presently limited because the phylogenetic placement of some enigmatic genera remains unclear. We therefore used Bayesian methods to obtain a well-supported phylogeny of 90 recognized genera using 5  kb of mitochondrial and nuclear sequences. The tree comprised three major clades: Lari (gulls, auks and allies plus buttonquails) as sister to Scolopaci (sandpipers, jacanas and allies), and in turn sister to Charadrii (plovers, oystercatchers and allies), as in previous molecular studies. Plovers and noddies were not recovered as monophyletic assemblages, and the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>plover</b> Pluvianus is apparently not a plover. Molecular dating using multiple fossil constraints suggests that the three suborders originated in the late Cretaceous between 79 and 102  Mya, and at least 14 lineages of modern shorebirds survived the mass extinction at the K/T boundary. Previous difficulties in determining the phylogenetic relationships of enigmatic taxa {{reflect the fact that}} they are well-differentiated relicts of old, genus-poor lineages. We refrain from suggesting systematic revisions for shorebirds at this time because gene trees may fail to recover the species tree when long branches are connected to deep, shorter branches, as is the case for some of the enigmatic taxa...|$|E
40|$|The goal {{of spatial}} {{co-location}} pattern mining {{is to find}} subsets of spatial features frequently located together in spatial proximity. Example co-location patterns include services requested frequently and located together from mobile devices (e. g., PDAs and cellular phones) and symbiotic species in ecology (e. g., Nile crocodile and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>plover).</b> Spatial clustering groups similar spatial objects together. Reusing research results in clustering, e. g. algorithms and visualization techniques, by mapping colocation mining problem into a clustering problem would be very useful. However, directly clustering spatial objects from various spatial features may not yield well-defined colocation patterns. Clustering spatial objects in each layer followed by overlaying the layers of clusters may not applicable to many application domains where the spatial objects in some layers are not clustered. In this paper, we propose {{a new approach to}} the problem of mining co-location patterns using clustering techniques. First, we propose a novel framework for co-location mining using clustering techniques. We show that the proximity of two spatial features can be captured by summarizing their spatial objects embedded in a continuous space via various techniques. We define the desired properties of proximity functions compared to similarity functions in clustering. Furthermore, we summarize the properties of a list of popular spatial statistical measures as the proximity functions. Finally, we show that clustering techniques can be applied to reveal the rich structure formed by co-located spatial features. A case study on real datasets shows that our method is effective for mining co-locations from large spatial datasets. 1 This work was done when the second author was with the Universit...|$|E
