50|$|<b>Hypervolemia,</b> or fluid overload, is {{the medical}} {{condition}} {{where there is}} too much fluid in the blood. The opposite condition is hypovolemia, which is too little fluid volume in the blood. Fluid volume excess in the intravascular compartment occurs due to an increase in total body sodium content and a consequent increase in extracellular body water. The mechanism usually stems from compromised regulatory mechanisms for sodium handling as seen in congestive heart failure (CHF), kidney failure, and liver failure. It may also be caused by excessive intake of sodium from foods, intravenous (IV) solutions and blood transfusions, medications, or diagnostic contrast dyes. Treatment typically includes administration of diuretics and restriction of the intake of water, fluids, sodium, and salt.|$|E
50|$|Fluid {{balance is}} {{an aspect of}} the {{homeostasis}} of living organisms in which the amount of water in the organism needs to be controlled, via osmoregulation and behavior, such that the concentrations of electrolytes (salts in solution) in the various body fluids are kept within healthy ranges. The core principle of fluid balance is that the amount of water lost from the body must equal the amount of water taken in; for example, in human homeostasis, the output (via respiration, perspiration, urination, defecation, and expectoration) must equal the input (via eating, drinking, and parenteral intake). Euvolemia is the state of normal body fluid volume, including blood volume, interstitial fluid volume, and intracellular fluid volume; hypovolemia and <b>hypervolemia</b> are imbalances. Water is necessary for all life on Earth. Humans can survive for 4 to 6 weeks without food but only for a few days without water.|$|E
50|$|The ACT {{test can}} be used to monitor anticoagulation effects, such as {{high-dose}} heparin before, during, and shortly after procedures that require intense anticoagulant administration, such as cardiac bypass, cardiac angioplasty, thrombolysis, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous dialysis. It measures the seconds needed for whole blood to clot upon exposure to an activator of an intrinsic pathway by the addition of factor XII activators. The clotting time is based on a relative scale and requires a baseline value for a point of comparison due to inconsistencies between the source and formulation of the activator being used. It is usually ordered in situations where the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test may take an excessive amount of time to process or is not clinically useful. Prolongation of the ACT may indicate a deficiency in coagulation factors, thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction. Clotting time measurements can be affected by other drugs that such as Warfarin, aprotinin and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors and may also be affected by physical perturbations to the body such as hypothermia, <b>hypervolemia</b> or hypovolemia.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} {{and consequences of}} <b>hypervolemia</b> in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) have not been investigated. Specifically, its impact on blood pressure (BP) and relationship with N-terminal fragment of prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are unknown. The objectives {{of this study were}} to establish the prevalence of <b>hypervolemia</b> among clinically stable KTRs, investigate the predictors of posttransplant <b>hypervolemia,</b> assess its impact on blood pressure, and determine its relationship with NT-proBNP. Methods: This single-center cross-sectional study enrolled 123 clinically stable KTRs. Extracellular volume status was determined by multifrequency bioimpedance analysis. Mild and severe <b>hypervolemia</b> were defined as percentage volume expansion of greater than 7 % and greater than 15 %, respectively. Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were measured, with mean arterial pressure (MAP) calculated. Serum NT-proBNP was quantified using a noncompetitive immunoluminometric assay. Potential demographic, nutritional, and clinical predictors of extracellular volume status, BP, and NT-proBNP levels were assessed. Results: <b>Hypervolemia</b> was present in 30 % of KTRs, with 5 % classified as severe <b>hypervolemia.</b> Significant predictors of volume expansion were increased sodium intake, advancing age, and reduced fat mass (P< 0. 01 for all associations). <b>Hypervolemia</b> was the only independent predictor of elevated MAP, SBP, and DBP (P< 0. 001 for all associations). Raised NT-proBNP levels were independently associated with both <b>hypervolemia</b> (P= 0. 01) and allograft dysfunction (P= 0. 03). Conclusions: <b>Hypervolemia</b> is unexpectedly common among clinically stable KTRs. It is closely associated with elevated BP. The relationship with increased sodium intake signals potential therapeutic focus. Further study is warranted to prospectively investigate objective measures of extracellular volume status among KTRs...|$|E
40|$|Expansion {{of blood}} volume (<b>hypervolemia)</b> {{has been well}} {{documented}} in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies as a consequence of endurance exercise training. Plasma volume expansion can account for nearly all of the exercise-induced <b>hypervolemia</b> up to 2 - 4 wk; after this time expansion may be distributed equally between plasma and red cell volumes. The exercise stimulus for <b>hypervolemia</b> has both thermal and nonthermal components that increase total circulating plasma levels of electrolytes and proteins. Although protein and fluid shifts from the extravascular to intravascular space may provide a mechanism for rapid <b>hypervolemia</b> immediately after exercise, evidence supports the notion that chronic <b>hypervolemia</b> associated with exercise training represents a net expansion of total body water and solutes. This net increase of body fluids with exercise training is associated with increased water intake and decreased urine volume output. The mechanism of reduced urine output appears to be increased renal tubular reabsorption of sodium through a more sensitive aldosterone action in man. Exercise training-induced <b>hypervolemia</b> appears to be universal among most animal species, although the mechanisms may be quite different. The <b>hypervolemia</b> may provide advantages of greater body fluid for heat dissipation and thermoregulatory stability as well as larger vascular volume and filling pressure for greater cardiac stroke volume and lower heart rates during exercise...|$|E

30|$|The first {{question}} that should then be asked {{is whether or}} not cardiac output is increased.

30|$|In TTTS, {{imbalanced}} flow mainly over arterio-venous anastomoses {{leads to}} <b>hypervolemia</b> in one (recipient) and hypovolemia {{in the other}} fetus (donor). This shift {{is caused by the}} architecture of the vessels {{on the surface of the}} placenta. In all monochorionic twin pregnancies, there are arterio-arterial, veno-venous and arterio-venous anastomoses between the two vascular systems. It is the latter, often named ‘‘deep’’ anastomoses, which are responsible for a continuous increased net flow from the donor towards the recipient, leading to hypo- and <b>hypervolemia</b> in the respective twin [6, 7]. <b>Hypervolemia</b> in the recipient causes an increased renal blood flow, polyuria and polyhydramnios which is the most striking symptom of the recipient in TTTS. Furthermore, the recipient is at risk of developing progressive cardiomyopathy. This includes cardiac dysfunction, artrioventricular valve regurgitation, pulmonary outflow obstruction, abnormal blood flow in the ductus venosus and, finally, hydrops fetalis. The donor is characterized by hypovolemia and oligo-/anhydramnios. This is often associated with an empty bladder, growth restriction and abnormal Doppler flow in the umbilical artery [8].|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} {{multiple}} studies across diverse patient populations have clearly demonstrated that aggressive fluid resuscitation {{is associated with}} an increased risk of complications and death. The only published study conducted in adult patients that has demonstrated that early aggressive fluid resuscitation improves outcome is the EGDT study by Rivers et al. [2]. However, {{the results of this study}} do not appear to be biologically plausible (implausible effect size) [70], the elements of the protocol were not based on evidence-based interventions [71], the analysis of the results of study has come under scrutiny [72], and the results were not validated in a large randomized controlled trial [65]. While hypovolemia will result in decreased cardiac output (and blood pressure) with inadequate organ perfusion leading to organ dysfunction, overzealous fluid resuscitation and <b>hypervolemia</b> induces a cascade of events that similarly results in organ dysfunction. From an evolutionary point of view, humans have evolved to deal with hypovolemia and not <b>hypervolemia.</b> <b>Hypervolemia</b> is a recent (last 20 years) and largely iatrogenic phenomenon. The argument is no longer ‘wet or dry’ but ‘just the right amount of fluid’ [73],[74].|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE; To {{evaluate}} {{interactive effects}} of volemic status and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the plasma levels of {{atrial natriuretic factor}} (ANF) in assist-controlled mechanical ventilation (MV). DESIGN: Three successive protocols applied in randomized order to each participant. SETTING: Clinical investigation laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one young, healthy adults. INTERVENTIONS: The three protocols were as follows: (1) MV+PEEP, normovolemia; (2) MV+PEEP, hypervolemia; and (3) spontaneous breathing (SB), <b>hypervolemia.</b> In protocols 1 and 2, a preliminary period of SB lasting 2 h was followed by MV alone (0. 5 h), MV+ 20 cm H 2 O PEEP (1 h), and a recovery period of SB (1. 5 h). <b>Hypervolemia</b> was induced by the continuous i. v. infusion of 3 L of 0. 9 % NaCl in 5 h (protocols 2 and 3). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Heart rate, BP, and the plasma levels of immunoreactive ANF and catecholamines were measured serially. During <b>hypervolemia,</b> ANF significantly decreased when PEEP was added to MV (protocol 2 : from 31. 1 +/- 2. 7 to 20. 7 +/- 1. 5 fmol/mL; p < 0. 01). This did not occur in normovolemia (protocol 1 : from 20. 0 +/- to 16. 7 +/- 1. 2 fmol/mL; p = NS). The different effects of MV+PEEP in normovolemia and <b>hypervolemia</b> were not related to differences in circulating catecholamine levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate {{for the first time}} (to our knowledge) that volemic status modulates the response of plasma ANF to PEEP in humans. The role of ANF in the water and salt retention induced by MV with PEEP might be limited to hypervolemic conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{dopamine}} receptor blockade on natriuresis {{is dependent on}} the degree of <b>hypervolemia.</b> A number of different physiological factors and systems have been suggested to be responsible for the natriuretic effect following acute isotonic volume expansion (VE). The variation in suggestions may depend on the prevailing status of the systems governing fluid and electrolyte balance before VE, on the expansion medium and on the rate and degree of VE. A study was performed to determine whether the previously documented attenuating effect of dopamine receptor blockade on natriuresis induced by VE {{is dependent on the}} degree of <b>hypervolemia.</b> Anesthetized rats were pretreated with the dopamine receptor blockers haloperidol (1 mg ·kg- 1 body weight, i. p.), SCH 23390 (30 µg. hr- 1 · kg- 1 i. v.) or vehicle and then subjected to VE at 2, 5 or 10 % of body weight per hour. VE at 2, 5 and 10 % increased sodium excretion in vehicle-pretreated animals 6 -, 29 - and 130 -fold, respectively. In the haloperidol-pretreated animals the natriuretic response (accumulated sodium excretion) to VE was attenuated by 67 % (P < 0. 05), 46 % (P < 0. 05) and 22 % (NS) at the three degrees of expansion, respectively. The corresponding attenuation in SCH 23390 -treated animals were 60 % (P < 0. 05), 56 % (P < 0. 05) and 19 % (NS), respectively. The gradual decrease in attenuation indicates that at varying degrees of <b>hypervolemia,</b> different physiological systems contribute differently to the renal natriuretic response. The dopamine system seems to be relatively more important in promoting natriuresis at the lower (physiological) range of <b>hypervolemia</b> whereas in the high range other factors have a greater impact...|$|E
