50|$|The 90 degree V8 engine has part-hemispherical {{combustion}} chambers with two overhead valves per cylinder operated by push-rods {{from a single}} chain-driven camshaft positioned centrally {{high up in the}} vee. Aluminium alloy pistons with steel connecting rods run in a cast chrome-iron block with sand-cast high-tensile light alloy heads and crankcase housing a short stiff dynamically balanced crankshaft carried on five bearings. The nose of the crankshaft carries a torsional vibration damper, a <b>four-bladed</b> <b>fan,</b> and the pulley for the triangulated thin belt drive for the dynamo and water pump. The dynamo is located between the cylinder blocks. At the rear the drive is taken {{from the back of the}} camshaft for the distributor positioned high above the unit behind the two semi-downdraught SU carburettors. There is a separate exhaust system for each bank of cylinders. Light alloy is used for the valve covers, tappet blocks, sump and inlet manifolds. Cooling is by pump and fan with a thermostatic by-pass control.|$|E
500|$|Inside {{the ornate}} building's third floor {{courtroom}} is a stained glass skylight centered by a ten-pointed star. The room is adorned with six brass lamps, and chandeliers, which are clustered with glass globes. In its original state an old-fashioned, <b>four-bladed</b> ceiling <b>fan</b> {{hung from the}} courtroom ceiling. The third floor courtroom has been called, [...] "the building's single most distinctive interior space" [...] by Steve Bigolin. The furnishings in the courtroom, including the chandeliers, plasterwork, beveled glass doors and stained glass work are all original.|$|R
5000|$|ST-3 Pioneer 3 (Ka-Tuo-Zhe San-Hao 开拓者3号) is {{the first}} UAV {{developed}} by Divine Ark, which made its maiden flight on December 16, 2003, and the general designer is Mr. Kuan Tian-Jin (旷天金). ST-3 Pioneer 3 is designed to replace the imported Japanese VIP-200 unmanned blimp, and has greatly improved performance. For example, the payload is more than doubled and the remote control radius is twenty times than that of Japanese VIP-200 unmanned blimps sold to China. ST-3 Pioneer 3 is propelled {{by a pair of}} <b>four-blade</b> ducted <b>fans</b> driven by German engine. Specification: ...|$|R
40|$|Test {{procedures}} and a mounting configuration for the vibration testing of propeller fans {{have been developed}} and evaluated. The dynamic testing procedures are discussed in this article. To accurately interpret the acceleration data and properly identify the resonance frequencies, {{it is necessary to}} obtain a plot of the blade tip acceleration as a function of frequency over the frequency range of interests. Vibration measurements were made on a three-and <b>four-blade</b> propeller <b>fan</b> in a circular downflow unit heater. A subminiature accelerometer (1 gram) was attached to the leading tip of a specified fan blade. The acceleration signal was passed through a slip ring to a charge amplifier and then to a FFT analyzer. The normal operating condition tests yielded results that were in fair agreement with available theory...|$|R
2500|$|The initial VAM Pacers {{were the}} {{equivalents}} to the U.S. AMC Pacer DL models {{except for a}} noticeably longer list of standard equipment and included some features of the U.S. Limited models of 1979 and 1980. The VAM Pacer had had no model or trim level, and U.S. derivatives such as the Pacer X, the base model, and the Levis Pacer were not available. The VAM Pacer's standard engine was the gross [...] I6 with 7.7:1 compression ratio, 266 degree camshaft and a Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor coupled to a steel intake manifold, and featured a T-150 three-speed manual transmission with heavy duty clutch and a 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. All VAM Pacers came with heavy-duty suspension (front sway bar with stiff springs and shock absorbers), power brakes with front disks, power steering (rack and pinion unit), larger radiator with coolant recovery tank, rigid <b>four-bladed</b> cooling <b>fan,</b> and electronic ignition.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} was {{a standard}} all-metal semi-monocoque, with the side-by-side seats under a long, low rearward-sliding two-piece canopy, with its rear at the wing leading edge. The Albatross's undercarriage had two main wheels side by side, {{attached to the}} fuselage and retracting forward into it. Its tail wheel was steerable via the rudder bar. A modified motorcycle engine, located in {{the centre of the}} fuselage, drove a <b>four-blade</b> wooded ducted <b>fan.</b> This drew in air through intakes in the fuselage sides with slatted doors, closed when the engine was off, and exhausted ventrally just behind the trailing edge under the slender rear fuselage.|$|R
25|$|Both VAM Rebel-based Rambler Classics {{included}} {{almost the}} same equipment between the two body styles {{with only a few}} exceptions. The largest difference was in the front seats. The Classic 770 came with full-width bench seat while the Classic SST had individually adjustable units, even though some of the hardtops came with a front bench. The standard features included flow-through ventilation, front door flip-open air vents, four-wheel drum brakes, rigid <b>four-bladed</b> cooling <b>fan,</b> day-night rearview mirror, two-speed electric wipers, electric washers, luxury steering wheel, electric clock, 200km/h speedometer, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, AM Motorola radio with antenna, locking glove box, courtesy lights, dual rear ashtrays, four side armrests, front two-point seatbelts, dual coat hooks, dual dome lights on C-pillars (except 1969-1970 sedan), single dome light on headliner (1969-1970 sedan only), fold-down armrest integrated to the rear seat back, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, back-up lights, turn lights, and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment for both models included power drum brakes (standard with automatic transmission), power steering, automatic transmission (not available in 1967 and 1968), remote controlled driver and passenger outside mirrors, heater with front defroster, rubber-faced bumper guards, bumper tubes, and a locking gas cap, among others. Sales the two-door hardtop body style declined in 1970.|$|R
2500|$|The {{introductory}} 1974 Gremlins became unique {{by incorporating}} the front clip of the 1974 U.S. AMC Hornet models. VAM never attempted {{to hide the}} relation between the two models, which never harmed the sales or image of either model and was favored by the public. The launch of the Gremlin in Mexico also meant the resurrection of the [...] I6 engine that was discontinued in 1972. The engine was practically the same as in its final year except for a slightly lower compression ratio (8.3:1 instead of 8.5:1). The advertised output was still the same at 145 gross horsepower at 4,400 revolutions per minute and was restricted to one-barrel carburetors. In contrast, since 1973 all VAM-based Hornets had the [...] six as the standard and only engine. VAM Gremlins were basic economy cars with manual 3-speed transmission, four-wheel drum brakes, manual steering, front sway bar, column-mounted shifters only, rigid <b>four-bladed</b> cooling <b>fan,</b> folding bench seats, two-point front seatbelts, electric wipers and washers, monaural AM radio, cigarette lighter, front and rear ashtrays, locking glovebox, flip-open rear side vents, roof rack, full carpeting with driver's side rubber mat, padded sunvisors, sound-insulating cardboard-type headliner, dual coat hooks and round dome light. Options for 1974 included a column-mounted automatic transmission, power steering, power drum brakes, heater, parcel shelf, light group, remote-controlled driver and passenger side outside mirrors, sports steering wheel, bright molding package, and wheel trim rings. All VAM Gremlins used the AMC's three-pod instrument cluster from the domestic-built Hornet with a blank in the third gauge position from the factory. The introductory year production was 2,137.|$|R
