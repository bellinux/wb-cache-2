5|$|The PSD {{that emerged}} from the {{disintegration}} of PADESM was a powerful force in Malagasy politics throughout the First Republic. When Madagascar achieved independence in 1960, PSD leader Tsiranana was named the country's first president, a position he held until the rotaka protests forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>resign</b> in 1972. His administration was succeeded by the socialist nationalist Second Republic under Didier Ratsiraka.|$|E
5|$|Because Vice President Carlos Álvarez {{had already}} resigned, the Congress convened {{to appoint a}} new president. Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, {{governor}} of the San Luis Province, was in office for two months while calling for new presidential elections. Renewed demonstrations forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>resign</b> as well, and Eduardo Duhalde was appointed as the new president. He was able to complete De la Rúa's term of office.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in China, MacMurray fell into disagreement with Washington over U.S. policy towards the ruling Kuomintang (Nationalist) government, which had been demanding immediate revisions to or a cessation of the treaty system in place between the two countries. Whereas Washington wished to make concessions to the Nationalist government, MacMurray favored the enforcement of existing treaties. These differences of opinion led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>resign</b> in November 1929, whereupon he became a professor of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University.|$|E
2500|$|In late September, Akerman was {{appointed}} to a top Nova Scotia civil service job that required <b>him</b> <b>to</b> both <b>resign</b> from the Legislature and terminate his membership in the NDP.

50|$|Finishing 2nd on {{the table}} behind Melbourne Victory, Adelaide managed to reach the grand final, only to be thrashed 6-0.

And still I urge <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>resign.</b> I am not a rich man, even when such {{property}} as I have is compared to moderate fortunes of these days, but I would pay his salary willingly {{out of my own}} pocket rather than see him go....|$|R
5|$|The Scilly naval {{disaster}} of 1707, {{in which a}} fleet commanded by Sir Cloudesley Shovell foundered, highlighted mismanagement at the Admiralty, for which George was nominally responsible. Pressure grew to replace Admiral Churchill with someone more dynamic. By October 1708, five powerful politicians, known as the Whig Junto—Lords Somers, Halifax, Orford, Wharton and Sunderland—were clamouring {{for the removal of}} both Prince George and Churchill. Marlborough wrote to his brother telling <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>resign,</b> but Churchill refused, protected by Prince George.|$|E
5|$|Boyle {{sponsored}} a motion of non-confidence against the government. Despite enjoying {{the support of}} twelve Liberals, including Cushing, the motion was defeated and the government upheld. Rutherford attempted to quell the controversy by calling a royal commission, but pressure from many Liberals, including Bulyea, led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>resign</b> May 26, 1910; he was replaced by Arthur Sifton, hitherto the province's chief judge. In November, the royal commission issued its report. It found that the evidence did not show {{a conflict of interest}} on Rutherford's part, but the majority report was nevertheless highly critical of the former Premier. A minority report was much kinder, avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.|$|E
5|$|For its 1908–09 {{season the}} Metropolitan {{management}} {{brought in the}} Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini to share duties with Mahler, who made only 19appearances in the entire season. One of these was a much-praised performance of Smetana's The Bartered Bride on 19 February 1909. In {{the early part of}} the season Mahler conducted three concerts with the New York Symphony Orchestra. This renewed experience of orchestral conducting inspired <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>resign</b> his position with the opera house and accept the conductorship of the re-formed New York Philharmonic. He continued to make occasional guest appearances at the Met, his last performance being Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades on 5 March 1910.|$|E
50|$|He was {{licensed}} to preach in 1842, and October 3, 1850, was ordained {{pastor of the}} Congregational Church of Hamburg, {{in the town of}} Lyme. He married Lyme native Harriet A. Lord on August 12, 1851. With his wife and brother, Rev. Zalmon B. Burr, who was also his classmate, he went abroad in 1855, and spent nearly a year in travel. Burr continued in his pastorship throughout his life, until infirmity forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>resign</b> his pastorate in April, 1907; the church voted not to accept his resignation, but to continue the relationship of pastor as long as he lived.|$|R
50|$|Later, in 1556, Poullain was {{in charge}} of a quarrelsome French refugee {{congregation}} at Frankfurt. Jean Calvin himself had to intervene: Poullain was cleared of allegations against <b>him,</b> but had <b>to</b> <b>resign</b> his position, and Calvin questioned his judgement.|$|R
2500|$|With French's [...] "resignation" [...] imminent, Wilson, {{who appears}} to have {{remained}} loyal <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> attempted <b>to</b> <b>resign</b> and go on half pay (10 December) as he felt he could not serve under Haig or Robertson; Bonar Law and Charles E. Callwell attempted <b>to</b> dissuade <b>him.</b> Haig thought this unacceptable for such an able officer in wartime, and Robertson advised him that Wilson would [...] "do less harm" [...] in France than in England.|$|R
5|$|Hebel was {{interested}} in botany, natural history and other subjects. His literary work began with Allemannische Gedichte, which {{is perhaps the most}} popular work written in Alemannic. He had success with his calendar stories in the Badischer Landkalender, and later with Rheinländischer Hausfreund (Rhenish family friend), but a dispute between Catholics forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>resign</b> as editor of the calendar. In his last years he devoted himself increasingly to religion, becoming a prelate in 1819, but his wish to become a parish priest was never fulfilled. His last works were biblical stories for young readers, which served as textbooks until 1855. Hebel died 1826 in Schwetzingen. Goethe, Tolstoy, Gottfried Keller, Hermann Hesse and other writers have praised his works.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, he was {{consulted}} by Prime Ministers Joseph Lyons and Robert Menzies about defence matters. He campaigned {{for an increase}} {{in the size of the}} Australian Army, writing letters to newspapers, and a series of articles for Reveille, the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia's organ. After the outbreak of the Second World War, lobbied the Menzies government to appoint Blamey as Commander in Chief of the Army. In June 1940, he was appointed commandant of the Victorian Volunteer Defence Corps, the Australian version of the Home Guard, but ill-health forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>resign</b> in July 1940, to be replaced by Foott.|$|E
5|$|Lame duck {{president}} John Quincy Adams nominated Crittenden to the U.S. Supreme Court on December 17, 1828 but Senators {{who supported}} president-elect Jackson voted to postpone confirmation until Jackson could nominate his own man. After his brief service as Kentucky Secretary of State, {{the state legislature}} elected Crittenden to the second of his four non-consecutive stints in the U.S. Senate. Upon his election as president, William Henry Harrison appointed Crittenden as Attorney General, but 5 months after Harrison's death, political differences prompted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>resign</b> rather than continue his service under Harrison's successor, John Tyler.|$|E
25|$|On 17 June, Morsi {{appointed}} Adel el-Khayat, an Islamist possibly {{linked to}} the Luxor massacre where at least 58 tourists were brutally killed by al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya gunmen, as governor of Luxor with 17 other provincial governors. The move sparked protests by tourism workers and activists in Luxor outside el-Khayat's office forcing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> finally <b>resign</b> a week later {{in order to prevent}} bloodshed.|$|R
50|$|After holding {{meetings}} {{throughout the}} evening, Rudd addressed the media at 10:30pm {{to announce that}} Gillard had asked for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> either <b>resign</b> as Prime Minister or hold a leadership election the following day to determine the Leadership of the Labor Party. Rudd stated that a leadership election would take place the following day {{and that he would}} stand as a candidate.|$|R

5|$|The first president, Joseph R. Williams, {{designed}} {{a curriculum that}} required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, liberal arts, and practical training. The curriculum excluded Latin and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily manual labor, which kept costs down for both {{the students and the}} College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as elitist. They forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>resign</b> in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.|$|E
5|$|The libertines {{continued}} organizing opposition, insulting {{the appointed}} ministers, and challenging {{the authority of}} the Consistory. The council straddled both sides of the conflict, alternately admonishing and upholding Calvin. When Perrin was elected first syndic in February 1552, Calvin's authority appeared to be at its lowest point. After some losses before the council, Calvin believed he was defeated; on 24 July 1553 he asked the council to allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>resign.</b> Although the libertines controlled the council, his request was refused. The opposition realised that they could curb Calvin's authority, but they did not have enough power to banish him.|$|E
5|$|The {{party was}} {{according}} to political scientist Cas Mudde only very rarely accused of anti-Semitism – and even then, it was strongly condemned {{by the party}} leadership. When Roeland Raes {{cast doubt on the}} scale of the Holocaust in a television interview in 2001 for instance, the party leadership immediately called an emergency meeting, distanced itself from him and forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>resign.</b> The party also took screening measures against its local candidates to reveal any possible extremist connections, and rather wanted to risk not being able to fill its lists, rather than filling them with extremists. Particularly, the party wanted to distance itself from Holocaust denial, as it actively sought to reach out to Jewish voters in Antwerp.|$|E
50|$|Nick's {{private and}} working lives {{frequently}} overlapped, as {{his estranged wife}} Karen Newburn was a Ward Sister at the hospital. A reconciliation with her caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> respond to an emergency too late, costing a patient her life. Nick faced a tribunal, and pleaded guilty. Although the tribunal ruled not <b>to</b> discipline <b>him,</b> he decided <b>to</b> <b>resign.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Australian captain Allan Border {{threatened}} <b>to</b> <b>resign</b> if Australia {{did not win}} {{the four}} game One Day International series and then saw New Zealand go 2-0 up. Fortunately Australia won {{the last two games}} and Matthews was Man of the Match in the Fourth ODI at Eden Park, where he made 54, took 9-1-33-3 and held onto three catches in Australia's 44 run win. This allowed Border to announce that the team had improved enough for <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>resign,</b> much <b>to</b> the advantage of Australian cricket.|$|R
5000|$|On 5 May 2016, a {{spokesperson}} for Burnham confirmed {{that he had been}} approached by party officials in Greater Manchester, asking <b>him</b> <b>to</b> consider <b>resigning</b> from the Shadow Cabinet of Jeremy Corbyn in order to run in the upcoming mayoral election in 2017. It was also stated that, [...] "it is early days and no decision has been taken," [...] but that one would be made in coming weeks. It was speculated by some in the press that a decision <b>to</b> <b>resign</b> from Jeremy Corbyn's team could coincide with a poor performance by Labour in the local elections held on the same day.|$|R
