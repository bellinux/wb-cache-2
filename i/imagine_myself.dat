500|$|Speaking of his {{preparation}} for the scene, Barbette, who knew he was replacing the Vicomtesse, said, [...] "I tried to <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> a descendant of the Marquis de Sade, of the Comtesse de Chevigné...and {{a long line of}} rich bankers – all of which the Vicomtesse was. For a boy from Round Rock, Texas, that demanded a lot of concentration – {{at least as much as}} working on the wire." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2001, Ronald Isley {{stated that}} Aaliyah and the Isley Brothers had {{discussed}} a collaboration {{prior to her}} death. She had previously covered the Isley Brothers' single [...] "At Your Best (You Are Love)". By 2001, Aaliyah had enjoyed her now seven-year career and {{felt a sense of}} accomplishment. [...] "This is what I always wanted," [...] she said of her career in Vibe magazine. [...] "I breathe to perform, to entertain, I can't <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> doing anything else. I'm just a really happy girl right now. I honestly love every aspect of this business. I really do. I feel very fulfilled and complete." ...|$|E

I could scarcely <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> to be in the woods of Indiana, on the borders of the Wabash, while pacing the long resounding aisles, and surveying the stately colonnades of this church." ...|$|E
5000|$|..... As I {{was writing}} this song one Sunday, I <b>imagined</b> <b>myself</b> {{floating}} into space and {{looking down at}} my own body. I was <b>imagining</b> <b>myself</b> dying. Morbidly obsessed with these thoughts, I wrote this song about death. The next day I was told that Guy (Burchett), our 17 year-old messenger boy, had been tragically killed on his motorcycle the day before. Guy died on the day I wrote this song." ...|$|R
60|$|SHE. Just so. It {{put a lot}} {{of stuff}} into my head that I should never have dreamt of for <b>myself.</b> I <b>imagined</b> <b>myself</b> just like Candida.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, it's {{just to give}} one's self over to the Capitalistic System," [...] I <b>imagined</b> <b>myself</b> {{saying in}} good Socialist jargon; [...] "it's {{surrendering}} all one's beliefs. We MAY succeed, we MAY grow rich, but where would the satisfaction be?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The Salt Lake Tribune {{said that}} the album [...] "largely drops the punk-by-numbers that {{dominated}} past efforts {{to get a little}} more personal lyrically, thus becoming more approachable." [...] Alan Sculley of The Daily Herald explained that, [...] "Coming Home pretty much leaves any punk element behind. The songs still rock - just note the wallop delivered by [...] "Hold My Hand" [...] or [...] "Connected." [...] But the band pulls back on the tempos of virtually all of the songs." [...] Scene Point Blank writer Chris Abraham noted, [...] "Coming Home still encompasses the things that make New Found Glory great. Relatable lyrics, hooks so melodic and catchy that my hands are red from not buying a mitt, and, despite a mellower tone, I could still <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> going fucking nuts singing along to these songs live." [...] AbsolutePunk founder Jason Tate warned that, [...] "it's crucial you abandon any pre-conceived expectations for this album. If you're anticipating the band's previous albums re-hashed, you're going to be completely let-down. While the choruses and sing-a-long hooks could compete with the best on any of their previous albums - it's the slower melodic approach to the songs that truly makes the album come alive and fully breathe." [...] Rae Alexandra of Kerrang! magazine called the album a [...] "massive departure" [...] and suggested that, [...] "NFG are taking what will be, by far, the biggest gamble of their career. Some of you won't even recognise them immediately; it's not fast, it's not forced, but - in an entirely new way - it soars." [...] In an earlier Kerrang! article discussing the album, Alexandra wrote that [...] "It's Not Your Fault" [...] displays [...] "more maturity - and piano - than ever before", while [...] "When I Die" [...] is [...] "low key with orchestral accents", making it [...] "one of the most beautiful moments on Coming Home." [...] Corey Apar of AllMusic was in agreement and stated that [...] "from the album's packaging to the comfortable nature of the music, it actually feels more mature {{in a way that is}} catchy without seeming to care about radio accessibility." ...|$|E
6000|$|I saw her flush, and she answered, haughtily, [...] "You must {{excuse me}} if I refuse to <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> taking a servant's place, {{even for the}} sake of argument." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Speak for yourself, Mrs. Pettifer,' said Miss Pratt. 'Under no {{circumstances}} can I <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> resorting to a practice so degrading. A woman should find support {{in her own}} strength of mind.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... 5. The Gift of Fire [...] "So I <b>imagined</b> <b>myself</b> in {{conversation}} with Prometheus, who {{had come back to}} find out what we mortals had managed to do with the astounding powers that he had given to us alone of all creatures." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{came to me}} in {{the small}} hours that the real moral touchstone for this great doubting of mind was Marion. I lay {{composing}} statements of my problem and <b>imagined</b> <b>myself</b> delivering them to her--and she, goddess-like and beautiful; giving her fine, simply-worded judgment.|$|R
5000|$|This one I've had {{for quite}} a long time as a lyric written on a piece of paper...I was <b>imagining</b> <b>myself</b> as a kind of Johnny Cash figure and talking about bravado and angst and, you know, it's easy to {{complain}} and it's easy to bluff. It's very hard to do.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There, my man, {{that pretty}} bird {{has been sitting}} there ever since I can remember. How like it all looks to old times! I could <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> running in from Westminster on a saint's day.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> {{living without}} some {{opinions}}, but I should {{wish to have}} good reasons for them, and a wise man could help me to see which opinions had the best foundation, and would help me to live according to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her {{letting you}} see? No," [...] said Charlotte; [...] "the only thing I can <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> minding {{is what you}} yourself, if you don't look out, may let HER see." [...] To which she added: [...] "You may let her see, you know, that you're afraid." ...|$|E
500|$|Hayley Beck of CWG Magazine gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} EP, saying [...] "Honestly I could hear these songs being played in a nightclub, and I definitely never would've <b>imagined</b> <b>myself</b> dancing around to a Lifehouse track!" [...] She continues to describe the album, and describes the vocals as [...] "coarse vocals laid over a dancingly, mellow beat." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{idea for}} the {{character}} of Tintin {{and the sort of}} adventures that would befall him came to me, I believe, in five minutes, the moment I first made a sketch of the figure of this hero: that is to say, he had not haunted my youth nor even my dreams. Although it's possible that as a child I <b>imagined</b> <b>myself</b> in the role of a sort of Tintin." [...] Hergé, 15 November 1966.|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps I should admit on {{the title}} page that this book is [...] "By L. Frank Baum and his correspondents," [...] for I have used many {{suggestions}} conveyed to me in letters from children. Once on a time I really <b>imagined</b> <b>myself</b> [...] "an author of fairy tales," [...] but now I am merely an editor or private secretary {{for a host of}} youngsters whose ideas I am requestsed to weave into the thread of my stories.|$|R
6000|$|CURTIS--[Waving his remark aside.] One day, when I {{was trying}} to <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> without her, and finding nothing but hopelessness--yet knowing I must go--a thought {{suddenly}} struck me--a horrible but fascinating possibility that {{had never occurred to}} me before. [With feverish intensity.] Can you guess what it was? ...|$|E
60|$|And {{so it was}} arranged. Presently I {{was moving}} sombrely off through the darkness, Jeeves at my side, Aunt Dahlia calling after me {{something}} about trying to <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> {{the man who brought}} the good news from Ghent to Aix. The first I had heard of the chap.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that's another matter," [...] said Staniford. [...] "I confess I {{should be}} rather {{curious to know}} whether you liked Venice. I like it, but I can <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> sympathizing with people who detested it,--if they said so. Let me see what will give you some idea of it. Do you know Boston well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{we seem to}} be so cut {{off from}} every-day {{associations}} that I've <b>imagined</b> <b>myself</b> a sort of tourist, and I've been to that Catholic church over yonder, in hopes of seeing the Murillos and Raphaels--but I found it locked up, and so I trudged back without a sight of the masterpieces. But what's the reason that all the shops hereabouts have nothing but luxuries for sale? The windows are perfect tropics of oranges, and lemons, and belated bananas, and tobacco, and peanuts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wanted such charming {{children}}," [...] I explained--"my idea of charming children: {{the children}} I had <b>imagined</b> for <b>myself.</b> Even as babies you disappointed me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Styopa (Стёпа). Posledniye Novosti, No.6419, October 23, 1938, Paris. Written at Villa Beausoleil. [...] "I just <b>imagined</b> <b>myself</b> at {{the riding}} britzka coming from brother Yevgeny's estate {{which was on}} the border of Tulskaya and Orlovskaya guberniyas to the Boborykino station. Pouring rain. Early evening, the inn by the road and some kind of man at the doorway, using whip to clear his top-boots. Everything else clicked in so unexpectedly, that as I was {{starting}} it I couldn't guess how will it end," [...] Bunin wrote in My Stories' Origins.|$|R
60|$|I {{did my best}} to {{give him}} my ideas such as they were. And as they were still very vague ideas I have no doubt he found me rhetorical. I can <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> talking of the White Man's Burthen, and how in Africa it had seemed at first to sit rather staggeringly upon our under-trained shoulders. I spoke of {{slackness}} and planlessness.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{learning}} that Miss Taft {{was to be}} one of the members of the colony I accepted the trusteeship very readily. With three thousand dollars advance royalty in sight, I began to <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> establishing a little home somewhere in or near Chicago, and the idea of an inexpensive summer camp such as my artist friends had in mind, appealed to me strongly.|$|E
60|$|This longing grew upon me. I became restless with it. In {{the daytime}} I dreamed over my work. At night my sleep was broken and restless. At times I would even wander forth, at night into the park, and there, {{deep in the}} night shadow of the trees, <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> alone in the {{recesses}} of the dark woods remote from the toil and fret of our distracted civilization.|$|E
5000|$|She {{studied at}} the Moscow School No.856, and, a {{self-described}} 'ugly duckling', hated sports lessons there, because, being the smallest in the class, had to stand always the last in the line. [...] "I've always dreamt of becoming a doctor, and yet could never stop <b>imagining</b> <b>myself</b> on stage, singing or dancing," [...] she later remembered. At the age of ten she began to study ballet and for ten years, since fourteen, was regularly taking part dancing competitions. She enrolled into music school to learn piano, which she graduated in 1979.|$|R
6000|$|Such {{were the}} last words of my guide's drowsy, uninteresting tone of voice and glad {{to be rid of}} him, I strode out stoutly, in despite of large stones, briers, and BAD STEPS, which abounded in the road I had chosen. In the interim, I tried as much as I could, with verses from Horace and Prior, and all who have lauded the mixture of {{literary}} with rural life, to call back the visions of last night and this morning, <b>imagining</b> <b>myself</b> settled in same detached farm of the estate of Glentanner,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{analogy is}} in the rough at present. I haven't had time to {{condense}} and polish it. But you see the idea. Take my case, for instance. When I saw {{you a couple of}} days ago I knew in an instant that you were my affinity. But for years I had been looking for a woman almost your exact opposite. You are dark. Three days ago I couldn't have <b>imagined</b> <b>myself</b> marrying anyone who was not fair. Your eyes are grey. Three days ago my preference for blue eyes was a byword. You have a shocking temper. Three days ago--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know. The {{academic}} has its charm. There are moods {{in which}} I could <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> {{in love with}} an academic person. That regularity of line; that reasoned strictness of contour; that neatness of pose; that slightly conventional but harmonious grouping of the emotions and morals--you can see how it would have its charm, the Wedgwood in human nature? I wonder where Mrs. Mandel keeps her urn and her willow." ...|$|E
60|$|TARLETON. Good. Read Shakespear: {{he has a}} {{word for}} every occasion. [He takes the photographs, one in each hand, and looks {{from one to the}} other, pleased and interested, but without any sign of recognition] What a pretty girl! Very pretty. I can <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> falling in love with her when I was your age. I wasnt a bad-looking young fellow myself in those days. [Looking at the other] Curious that we should both have gone the same way.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot <b>imagine</b> <b>myself</b> {{in such a}} position. I could not, at any rate, {{have written}} such a letter as that, even if I would; {{and should have been}} afraid to write it if I could. I value peace and quiet too greatly to quarrel with my bishop,--unless, indeed, he should attempt to impose upon my conscience. There was nothing of that kind here. I think I should have seen that he had made a mistake, and have passed it over." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head. [...] "It would n't do. You would be horrified to learn even the things I <b>imagine</b> about <b>myself,</b> and {{shocked at the}} {{knowledge}} of evil displayed in my very mistakes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, what I KNOW {{about myself}} isn't really worth telling," [...] said Anne eagerly. [...] "If you'll only {{let me tell}} you what I <b>IMAGINE</b> about <b>myself</b> you'll think it ever so much more interesting." ...|$|R
5000|$|Young {{revealed}} {{the origin of}} the album's title when he said: I'm from the middle of nowhere in Minnesota you see, so the ocean has always been a curiously dreamy, ethereal, almost romantic thing to me. Over the years I {{spent a great deal of}} time with my eyes closed, <b>imagining</b> <b>myself</b> having the most wonderful adventures by the seaside. Doing things one can only do in dusk and glow and midsummer dreams, as if the back of my closed eyelids were a silver screen and I was a sentimental projectionist with hundreds of fanciful reels at hand, all ready to roll. Thus is the reasoning behind the title. Adam Young ...|$|R
