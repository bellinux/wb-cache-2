The 1922 referendum results were 8,774 for responsible government and 5,989 for joining South Africa.

25|$|Congress and the American {{states had}} {{no end of}} {{difficulty}} financing the war. In 1775 there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies, not nearly enough to cover existing transactions, let alone on a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen, and donations from patriotic citizens. Another was to delay actual payments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise it would be made good after the war. Indeed, in 1783 the soldiers and officers were given land grants to cover the wages they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781, when Robert Morris was named Superintendent of Finance of the United States, did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters. Morris used a French loan in 1782 {{to set up the}} private Bank of North America to finance the war.

40|$|I {{address the}} {{following}} {{issue in this}} paper: how does information sharing among banks about borrowers affect banks' competition, and ultimately, the interest rate borrowers pay for the loan they take? One would expect that <b>full</b> information <b>sharing</b> among banks reduces lenders' risk and results in lower lending rates than any other arrangement. This may be the reason why regulators of the banking industry {{would like to see}} <b>full</b> information <b>sharing</b> in most countries. I shall show below that the regulators' expectation is usually not fulfilled. <b>Full</b> information <b>sharing</b> will result in higher lending rates than any other form of information sharing under fairly general conditions. Despite its lucrative features, banks are not always keen on supporting <b>full</b> information <b>sharing.</b> Information sharing only about bad borrowers is the fully rational banks' dominant strategy if the proportion of bad borrowers is substantial. Myopic banks would opt for no information sharing if the proportion of bad borrowers is large. Fully rational banks would only choose <b>full</b> information <b>sharing</b> if the share of bad borrowers is small. Borrowers with good credit records, on the other hand, would prefer information sharing only about bad customers rather than full or no information sharing, for they pay lower interest rates under a black list than with any other form of information sharing or with no information sharing...|$|R

2500|$|These {{securities}} {{are more}} complex and an accurate prognoses of repayment more difficult than with other debt ratings. This {{is because they are}} formed by pooling debt — usually consumer credit assets, such as mortgages, credit card or auto loans — and structured by [...] "slicing" [...] the pool into multiple [...] "tranches", each with a different priority of payment. Tranches are often likened to buckets capturing cascading water, where the water of monthly or quarterly repayment flows down to the next bucket (tranche) only if the one above has been filled with its <b>full</b> <b>share</b> and is overflowing. The higher-up the bucket in the income stream, the lower its risk, the higher its credit rating, and lower its interest payment. This means the higher-level tranches have more credit worthiness than would a conventional unstructured, untranched bond with the same repayment income stream, and allows rating agencies to rate the tranches triple A or other high grades. Such securities are then eligible for purchase by pension funds and money market funds restricted to higher-rated debt, and for use by banks wanting to reduce costly capital requirements.|$|E
