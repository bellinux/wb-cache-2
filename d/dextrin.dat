25|$|Amylodextrin is {{a linear}} <b>dextrin</b> or short chained amylose (DP 20-30) {{that can be}} {{produced}} by enzymatic hydrolysis of the alpha-1,6 glycosidic bonds or debranching amylopectin. Amylodextrin colors blue with iodine.|$|E
25|$|Dextrins are white, yellow, {{or brown}} powders that are {{partially}} or fully water-soluble, yielding optically active solutions of low viscosity.

40|$|<b>Dextrins</b> are {{partially}} hydrolyzed starch products {{which are}} used {{in a wide range}} of applications. Hydrolysis can be performed by acid or enzymatic reaction. However the properties of <b>dextrins</b> are influenced by the type of reaction and the source of starch. The aim of the present study was to determine physicochemical properties of <b>dextrins</b> obtained from hydrolysis of starches (corn and wheat) and flours (wheat and cassava) by using sorghum malt amylases. Hydrolysis of starches and flours was performed at 65 °C, the hydrolysates were centrifuged and spray-dried for analysis. Physicochemical and structure of the powders were investigated. Results showed that the proportion of DP 2 (maltose and isomaltose) was higher in <b>dextrins</b> and more in <b>dextrins</b> from wheat flour. Low water activity and low dissolution time were found in all <b>dextrins.</b> XRD patterns revealed that the crystalline structure partially disappeared in some of them. At 30 % concentration, we noted a Newtonian behavior for the <b>dextrins.</b> The freeze-concentrated T 0 g and the peak melting temperature (T 0 m) determined by DSC (DSC) showed lowest values for <b>dextrins</b> from wheat. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the <b>dextrins</b> were quite stable until 200 °C. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare the prebiotic properties of starch <b>dextrins,</b> that is, resistant <b>dextrins</b> obtained from potato starch in the process of simultaneous thermolysis and chemical modification, which were selected based on previous research. Both prepared <b>dextrins</b> met the definition criterion of dietary fiber and also the basic prebiotic criterion – they were not degraded by the digestive enzymes of the initial sections of the gastrointestinal tract. The growth of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, as well as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, Bacteroides, and Clostridium strains isolated from feces of healthy people, showed that both studied <b>dextrins</b> were utilized as a source of assimilable carbon and energy by the strains. Furthermore, better growth (higher numbers of cells) counts of probiotic bacteria than those of fecal isolates indicated that the studied resistant <b>dextrins</b> showed a selective effect. Both <b>dextrins</b> might be considered as substances with prebiotic properties due to their chemical and physical properties and selectivity towards the studied probiotic bacterial strains...|$|R
25|$|All {{automotive}} antifreeze formulations, {{including the}} newer organic acid (OAT antifreeze) formulations, are environmentally hazardous {{because of the}} blend of additives (around 5%), including lubricants, buffers and corrosion inhibitors. Because the additives in antifreeze are proprietary, the safety data sheets (SDS) provided by the manufacturer list only those compounds which {{are considered to be}} significant safety hazards when used in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Common additives include sodium silicate, disodium phosphate, sodium molybdate, sodium borate, denatonium benzoate and <b>dextrin</b> (hydroxyethyl starch). Disodium fluorescein dyes are added to antifreeze to help trace the source of leaks, and as an identifier since some different formulations are incompatible.|$|E
25|$|The {{digestive}} {{functions of}} saliva include moistening food {{and helping to}} create a food bolus. This lubricative function of saliva allows the food bolus to be passed easily from the mouth into the esophagus. Saliva contains the enzyme amylase, also called ptyalin, which is capable of breaking down starch into simpler sugars such as maltose and <b>dextrin</b> that can be further broken down in the small intestine. Only about 30% starch digestion {{takes place in the}} mouth cavity. Salivary glands also secrete salivary lipase (a more potent form of lipase) to begin fat digestion. Salivary lipase plays a large role in fat digestion in newborn infants as their pancreatic lipase still needs some time to develop.|$|E
25|$|An {{improved}} {{method was}} introduced by Louis Seutin, (1793–1865) of Brussels. In 1815 Seutin {{had served in the}} allied armies in the war against Napoleon and was on the field of Waterloo. At the time of the development of his bandage he was chief surgeon in the Belgium army. Seutin’s “bandage amidonnee” consisted of cardboard splints and bandages soaked in a solution of starch and applied wet. These dressings required 2 to 3 days to dry, depending on the temperature and humidity of the surroundings. The substitution of <b>Dextrin</b> for starch, advocated by Velpeau, the man widely regarded as the leading French surgeon {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century, reduced the drying time to 6 hours. Although this was a vast improvement, it was still a long time, especially in the harsh environment of the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dextrins</b> are a {{group of}} low-molecular-weight {{carbohydrates}} produced by the hydrolysis of starch or glycogen. <b>Dextrins</b> are mixtures of polymers of D-glucose units linked by α-(1→4) or α-(1→6) glycosidic bonds.|$|R

40|$|Granular {{potato starch}} and {{amylopectin}} potato starch were methylated to molar substitutions (MS) up to 0. 29. Extensive alpha-amylase digestion gave mixtures of partially methylated oligomers. Precipitation of larger fragments by methanol yielded mainly alpha-limit <b>dextrins</b> (84  99 %). Methanol precipitates were extensively digested with beta-amylase yielding alpha,beta-limit <b>dextrins.</b> The average substitution level of branched glucose residues in the <b>dextrins</b> thus obtained was determined after per deuteriomethylation by using FAB mass spectrometry, and {{compared with that}} of the linearly linked glucose residues. The present work demonstrates that methylation does not show any preference for substitution at either branched or linearly linked glucose residues, taking into account the inherently lower amount of substitution sites at branched residues. The results corroborate earlier studies wherein it was found that substituents in branched regions are distributed almost randomly. In addition, the data enable the determination of the average degree of branching of partially methylated <b>dextrins...</b>|$|R

40|$|Amylose {{fractions}} of different peak Degree of Polymerisation (DP) (DP 20, DP 60, DP 400, DP 950) were complexed with docosanoic acid (C 22) and glyceryl monostearate (GMS) at 60 and 90 degreesC. Complexation yields, relative crystallinities, dissociation temperatures and enthalpies increased with amylose chain lengths (DP 20 -DP 60 -DP 400). Relative crystallinities and thermal stabilities of the DP 950 -complexes were {{slightly lower than}} those of the other amylose fractions, probably due to increased conformational disorders, resulting in crystal defaults. Molecular weight distributions of the complexes revealed that, irrespective to the complexation temperature, the critical DP for complex formation and precipitation was 35 and 40 for complexes with GMS and C 22, respectively, corresponding to the length needed to accommodate two GMS- or C 22 -molecules within an amylose helix. Complexation of <b>dextrins</b> with a well-chosen lipid, allows to separate starch derived <b>dextrins</b> with a predictable critical chain length as border. <b>Dextrins,</b> of sufficient DP will complex and precipitate, while the shorter <b>dextrins</b> will remain in solution.

40|$|Unit {{chain length}} {{distributions}} of amylopectins and their φ,β-limit <b>dextrins</b> (reflecting amylopectin internal part) from 11 Chinese sweetpotato genotypes {{were characterized by}} high performance anion-exchange chromatography after debranching, and {{were related to the}} thermal and pasting properties of granular starches. The weight-based unit chain length profiles of whole amylopectin and their internal parts both had three distinguishable major groups with approximate range of DP 6 - 36, 37 - 68, and > 69 for amylopectins and DP 3 - 25, 26 - 55, and > 55 for φ,β-limit <b>dextrins.</b> Among different genotypes, two different patterns of B fp (fingerprint B-chains, DP 3 - 7) were observed for φ,β-limit <b>dextrins,</b> whereas A fp (fingerprint A-chains, DP 6 - 8) for whole amylopectins were consistent. Reconstruction of amylopectins from their φ,β-limit <b>dextrins</b> revealed that B-chains with internal DP > 20 possessed an external chain length corresponding to the average value DP 12. 8. Wide genetic variations were recorded among structural parameters, of which several concerning the amylopectin internal part were highly correlated to the thermal and pasting parameters of sweetpotato starches, and suggested that the internal part of amylopectin is critical to the physical behavior of granular starch. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|<b>Dextrins</b> can be {{produced}} from starch using enzymes like amylases, as during digestion {{in the human body}} and during malting and mashing, or by applying dry heat under acidic conditions (pyrolysis or roasting). The latter process is used industrially, and also occurs on the surface of bread during the baking process, contributing to flavor, color and crispness. <b>Dextrins</b> produced by heat are also known as pyrodextrins. The starch hydrolyses during roasting under acidic conditions, and short-chained starch parts partially rebranch with α-(1,6) bonds to the degraded starch molecule. See also Maillard Reaction.|$|R
40|$|Starch {{in nature}} appears to contain {{two types of}} {{polymers}} of glucose, the amyloses, with a linear type of molecule showing a blue color with iodine, and the amylopectins, with highly branched structures, which give a red color with iodine. Beta amylase, capable of splitting maltose from the non-aldehydic end of a chain, can complete the hydrolysis of amyloses, but can carry the splitting of the amylopectins apparently only to the points of branching, producing limit <b>dextrins,</b> residual sub-stances of high molecular weight which give colors with iodine. Alpha amylase causes quick fragmentation of amyloses, amylopectins, or limit <b>dextrins</b> into reducing <b>dextrins</b> which yield no color with iodine. Since alpha amylase is labile to acid whereas beta amylase is stable to acid at low temperatures, it is possible selectively to inactivate alpha amylase by treating a diastase preparation at 0 °C. for 20 minutes in an acetate buffer solution at pH 3.
