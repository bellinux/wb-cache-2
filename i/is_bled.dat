Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This <b>is</b> <b>bled</b> from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E

The heart beats {{for a time}} as the animal <b>is</b> <b>bled</b> from its sliced gills. Relaxing the salmon like this when it is killed {{produces}} firm, long-keeping flesh. Lack of disease in wild populations and low stocking densities used in the cages means that New Zealand salmon farmers do not use antibiotics and chemicals that are often needed elsewhere.|$|E

This method, known as the doble pasta (meaning [...] "double paste") takes the skins from the early pressed rosé wine and adds them to the red wine (similar to the Italian ripasso method). The rosados are made like normal with a light, fruity style while the red wines made with the extra skins are darker in color and more deeply concentrated.|$|E

2500|$|In 1893, after {{receiving}} a letter from Cosima Wagner telling {{him that he had}} to read Gobineau's Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines, Chamberlain, who was fluent in French, duly complied with her request. Chamberlain accepted Gobineau's belief in an Aryan master-race, but rejected his pessimism, writing that Gobineau's philosophy was [...] "the grave of every attempt to deal practically with the race question and left only one honorable solution, that we at once put a bullet through our heads". Chamberlain's time in Vienna shaped his anti-Semitism and Pan-Germanism. Despite living in Vienna from 1889 to 1909 when he moved to Bayreuth, Chamberlain had nothing but contempt for the multi-ethnic, multi-religious Habsburg empire, taking the viewpoint that the best thing that could happen to the Austrian empire would be for it to be annexed by Germany to end the Völkerchaos (chaos of the peoples). Vienna had a large Jewish population (until 1938, Vienna was about [...] 10% Jewish), and Chamberlain's time in Vienna marked the only time in his life when he actually encountered Jews. Chamberlain's letters from Vienna constantly complain about how he was having to meet and deal with Jews, every one of whom he detested. In 1894 after visiting a spa, Chamberlain wrote: [...] "Unfortunately like everything else...it has fallen {{into the hands of the}} Jews, which includes two consequences: every individual <b>is</b> <b>bled</b> to the utmost and systematically, and there is neither order nor cleanliness". In 1895, he wrote: However, we shall have to move soon anyway, for our house having been sold to a Jew...it will soon be impossible for decent people to live in it...Already the house being almost quite full of Jews, we have to live in a state of continual warfare with the vermin which is a constant and invariable follower of this chosen people even in the most well-to-do classes. In another letter of 1895, Chamberlain wrote he was still influenced by French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's critique of the Jews as mindlessly materialistic, writing that Proudhon was [...] "one of the most acute minds of the century" [...] and [...] "I find many points of contact between the Wagner-Schiller mode of thought and the anarchism of Proudhon." [...] At the same time, Chamberlain's marriage to Anna began to fall apart as his wife was frequently sick and though she assisted her husband with his writings, he did not find her very intellectually stimulating. Chamberlain started to complain more and more that his wife's frequent illnesses forced him to tend to her and were holding back his career.|$|E

An additional group of ten males and ten females received the vehicle, 10  % ethanol in sterile saline, and served as the control. All rats received a dose volume of 5  mL/kg.
