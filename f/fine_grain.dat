5|$|Video {{fluoroscopy}} uses {{x-ray radiation}} to produce moving {{pictures of the}} mouth during articulation or swallowing. It is considered the gold standard in studies of dysphagia because {{of its ability to}} take videos of the entire digestive tract during swallowing events. It is often used to study and treat aspiration of food, what parts of the digestive tract are malfunctioning during swallowing, and positions in which swallowing is easiest. Only limited data is able to be collected as sessions are typically limited to three minutes due to the hazards of radiation exposure. and it does not allow for <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> analysis of tongue movements.|$|E
25|$|At {{director}} Howard Hawks' urging production partner Charles K. Feldman {{agreed to}} Bacall's scenes being re-written to heighten the 'insolent' quality that had intrigued critics and audiences in that film. By chance, a 35-mm nitrate composite master positive (<b>fine</b> <b>grain)</b> of the 1945 version survived. The UCLA Film Archive, {{in association with}} Turner Entertainment and with funding provided by Hugh Hefner, restored and released it in 1996.|$|E
25|$|Fuji films also {{integrate}} tabular grains {{in their}} SUFG (Super Unified <b>Fine</b> <b>Grain)</b> films. In their case, the SUFG grain {{is not only}} tabular, it is hexagonal and consistent in shape throughout the emulsion layers. Like the T-grain, it has a larger surface area in a smaller grain (about one-third the size of traditional grain) for the same light sensitivity. In 2005, Fuji unveiled their Eterna 500T stock, {{the first in a}} new line of advanced emulsions, with Super Nano-structure Σ Grain Technology.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the effect of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> on creep property of lamellar orientation controlled Ti- 43 mol% Al alloy, compressive creep tests were performed. Uniaxial compression process at αSingle-phase region and related compression process at (α＋γ) two-phase region made the lamellar interface almost parallel to the compression process plane. <b>Fine</b> <b>grains</b> were observed around the orientation controlled lamellar colonies after the process at (α＋γ) two-phase region. Volume fraction of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> increased with the decrease in true strain rate during the process. Further, in the same true strain rate, volume fraction of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> increased with the increase in true strain. These characteristics were almost the same in the case of dynamic recrystallization at the single-phase alloy. Thus, the formation of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> at (α＋γ) two phase region may indicate the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization. Minimum creep rate of the processed material increased with the increase in volume fraction of <b>fine</b> <b>grains.</b> The increase of creep rate of the entire material {{may be due to the}} preferential creep deformation of formed <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> by a diffusional creep mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The 75 -μm {{particle}} size {{is used to}} discriminate between <b>fine</b> and coarse <b>grains.</b> Further analysis of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> is typically based on the plasticity chart. Whereas pore-fluid-chemistry-dependent soil response is a salient and distinguishing characteristic of <b>fine</b> <b>grains,</b> pore-fluid chemistry is not addressed in current classification systems. Liquid limits obtained with electrically contrasting pore fluids (deionized water, 2 -M NaCl brine, and kerosene) are combined to define the soil "electrical sensitivity. " Liquid limit and electrical sensitivity can be effectively used to classify <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> according to their fluid-soil response into no-, low-, intermediate-, or high-plasticity <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> of low, intermediate, or high electrical sensitivity. The proposed methodology benefits from the accumulated experience with liquid limit {{in the field and}} addresses the needs of a broader range of geotechnical engineering problems. © ASCE...|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways insects can be fossilized and preserved including compressions and impressions, concretions, mineral replication, charcoalified (fusainized) remains, and their trace remains. Compressions and Impressions are the most extensive types of insect fossils, occurring in rocks from the Carboniferous to Recent. Impressions are like a cast or mold of a fossil insect, showing its form and even some relief, like pleating in the wings, but usually little or no color from the cuticle. Compressions preserve remains of the cuticle, so color distinguishes structure. In exceptional situations, microscopic features such as microtrichia on sclerites and wing membranes are even visible, but preservation of this scale also requires a matrix of exceptionally <b>fine</b> <b>grain,</b> such as in micritic muds and volcanic tuffs. Because arthropod sclerites are held together by membranes, which readily decompose, many fossil arthropods are known only by isolated sclerites. Far more desirable are complete fossils. Concretions are stones with a fossil at the core whose chemical composition {{differs from that of}} the surrounding matrix, usually formed as a result of mineral precipitation from decaying organisms. The most significant deposit consists of various localities of the Late Carboniferous Francis Creek Shale of the Carbondale Formation at Mazon Creek, Illinois, which are composed of shales and coal seams yielding oblong concretions. Within most concretions is a mold of an animal and sometimes a plant that is usually marine in origin.|$|E
25|$|At {{certain times}} of the year these beaches can be covered with dried seaweed from the {{extensive}} marine vegetation under the waters of Western Port, however when the seaweed is not in season, all of Somers beaches boast clean sand. The South Beach has an intricate system of rock pools, this is both of great interest to beachcombers, and something of a curse, as the beach is a difficult place to swim. The Merricks Creek Inlet is a tidal creek that flows with the tides of Western Port. About 50cm {{below the surface of the}} sandbed of the creek lies a darker sand that gives off a hydrogen sulphide smell when disturbed. Sand all these beaches is generally <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> mixed with crushed sea shells. Small reefs exist in a few places and can be seen at low tide, but these are only rocky reefs incapable of supporting coral. At low tide these reefs can make navigation near the beach difficult for watercraft and are clearly marked with buoys. A succession of big storm tides came in on 24 March, 25 March, 22 April, 23 April and 15 June 2011, severely eroding the sand dunes east the Merricks Creek. In 2012, the wooden wall that had fixed that path of the Merricks Creek since 1974, was taken down, as it was deemed unsafe and not adequately performing its job anymore. Starting in July 2012 and finishing in September 2012, a new rock wall was built, to fix the creek on a path straight into Westernport. For the three and a half years the wall has been in place, a noticeable buildup of sand has occurred east of the wall, while considerable erosion has occurred west of the wall. In November 2015, the entrance to the Merricks Creek was filled in with a sand groyne, as a short term solution to the constant hydrogen sulphide odour caused by the breakdown of sea grasses within the creek. As of June 2016, the sand groyne is still in place, and as such the surrounding beaches have benefitted with the buildup of sand.|$|E

40|$|We tried TL dating for {{the quartz}} {{inclusion}} from the fracture {{zone of the}} Tsuruga Fault. As the growth curves showed a tendency of saturation, we evaluated the equivalent doses by a curve fitting to a exponential function. Although the natural TL intensity of the <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> is {{lower than that of}} the coarse ones, the equivalent doses, and so the TL ages have no dependency on grain size. The differences of TL characteristics of samples show the circumstances well. ① The <b>finer</b> <b>grains</b> have the lower saturation level. ② All <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> do not always give the younger TL age. The fact that the decrease of effective trap number has extensively occurred to <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> after faulting is responsible for the former. The latter infers the existence of a certain limited grain size, for the sample of which, the paleodose is zeroed most effectively. TL age of the Tsuruga Fault is 33 ± 3 ka.

2500|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{determination of}} the structures of liquid metals. There {{was a need for}} structural studies of liquid sodium and sodium-potassium alloys because these were used as coolants in fast-breeder reactors. [...] Fulmer developed a high temperature x-ray diffractometer for investigating the structures of liquid metals and alloys. In addition to its studies of liquid alkali metals, Fulmer discovered that certain eutectics, such as those in the gold-silicon and gold-germanium systems, have a structure in the liquid phase that has to be disrupted on crystallization.

2500|$|Rock-fill dams are {{embankments}} of compacted free-draining granular {{earth with}} an impervious zone. The earth utilized often contains {{a high percentage}} of large particles, hence the term [...] "rock-fill". The impervious zone may be on the upstream face and made of masonry, concrete, plastic membrane, steel sheet piles, timber or other material. The impervious zone may also be within the embankment in which case it is referred to as a core. In the instances where clay is utilized as the impervious material the dam is referred to as a composite dam. To prevent internal erosion of clay into the rock fill due to seepage forces, the core is separated using a filter. Filters are specifically graded soil designed to prevent the migration of <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> soil particles. When suitable material is at hand, transportation is minimized leading to cost savings during construction. Rock-fill dams are resistant to damage from earthquakes. However, inadequate quality control during construction can lead to poor compaction and sand in the embankment which can lead to liquefaction of the rock-fill during an earthquake. Liquefaction potential can be reduced by keeping susceptible material from being saturated, and by providing adequate compaction during construction. An example of a rock-fill dam is New Melones Dam in California or the Fierza Dam in Albania.|$|E
