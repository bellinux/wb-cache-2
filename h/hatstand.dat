2500|$|Ovid Crohmălniceanu also {{proposed}} that Bonciu {{is in fact}} an Expressionist by accident, whose actual literary models are the proto-Expressionism of Vienna Secession and (even older) currents born into Austrian culture. Bonciu, he argues, gained an Expressionist profile by performing his own, independent, mix of literary themes: transcendence is borrowed from Neoromanticism, instinctual drive from Naturalism, subjectivity from Impressionism, and [...] "paneroticism" [...] from Jugendstil and Symbolism. Other literary historians presume the same connections. Dan Grigorescu suggests that Bonciu's Expressionism was mostly [...] "exterior", spread over Jugendstil, Impressionism, Surrealism and various eclectic mixtures; Marian Victor Buciu focuses on Bonciu as a meeting point between the [...] "Naturalist typology" [...] and Expressionism, noting that his Surrealism is less supplied. Nevertheless, Călinescu supposes an ideological link between Bonciu and the Romanian Surrealists at unu magazine, since a [...] "man with <b>hatstand</b> head" [...] sketch, by unu artists Jules Perahim, illustrated one of Bonciu's works. In Călinescu's interpretation, the [...] "grotesque" [...] drawing brings to life [...] "a moment of dementia", and this is analogous to Bonciu's own intentions: [...] "H. Bonciu, who despises realism and claims to be writing 'with the red of my arteries and the green of my cerebrospinal fluid', works in the same hieroglyphic mode." ...|$|E

60|$|A young man, cheaply {{dressed and}} strange in manner, {{appears in the}} garden; steals to the {{pavilion}} door; and looks in. Seeing that there is nobody, he enters cautiously until he has come far enough to see into the <b>hatstand</b> corner. He draws a revolver, and examines it, apparently {{to make sure that}} it is loaded. Then his attention is caught by the Turkish bath. He looks down the lunette, and opens the panels.|$|E
60|$|Major Brill, late of the Fenshire Volununteers, {{stood in}} front of the small piece of glass in the <b>hatstand,</b> and with a firm and {{experienced}} hand gave his new silk hat a slight tilt over the right eye. Then he took his cane and a new pair of gloves, and with a military but squeaky tread, passed out into the road. It was a glorious day in early autumn, and the soft English landscape was looking its best, but despite the fact that there was nothing more alarming in sight than a few cows on the hillside a mile away, the Major paused at his gate, and his face took on an appearance of the greatest courage and resolution before proceeding. The road was dusty and quiet, except for the children playing at cottage doors, and so hot that the Major, heedless of the fact that he could not replace the hat at exactly the same angle, stood in the shade of a tree while he removed it and mopped his heated brow.|$|E
60|$|Great George Street, Westminster, is {{the address}} of Doyle and Broadbent, civil engineers. On the {{threshold}} one reads that the firm consists of Mr Lawrence Doyle and Mr Thomas Broadbent, and that their rooms are on the first floor. Most of their rooms are private; for the partners, being bachelors and bosom friends, live there; and the door marked Private, next the clerks' office, is their domestic sitting room {{as well as their}} reception room for clients. Let me describe it briefly {{from the point of view}} of a sparrow on the window sill. The outer door is in the opposite wall, close to the right hand corner. Between this door and the left hand corner is a <b>hatstand</b> and a table consisting of large drawing boards on trestles, with plans, rolls of tracing paper, mathematical instruments and other draughtsman's accessories on it. In the left hand wall is the fireplace, and the door of an inner room between the fireplace and our observant sparrow. Against the right hand wall is a filing cabinet, with a cupboard on it, and, nearer, a tall office desk and stool for one person. In the middle of the room a large double writing table is set across, with a chair at each end for the two partners. It is a room which no woman would tolerate, smelling of tobacco, and much in need of repapering, repainting, and recarpeting; but this is the effect of bachelor untidiness and indifference, not want of means; for nothing that Doyle and Broadbent themselves have purchased is cheap; nor is anything they want lacking. On the walls hang a large map of South America, a pictorial advertisement of a steamship company, an impressive portrait of Gladstone, and several caricatures of Mr Balfour as a rabbit and Mr Chamberlain as a fox by Francis Carruthers Gould.|$|E

50|$|Coat rack, coat {{stand or}} a <b>hatstand</b> is {{an item of}} {{furniture}} on which clothes may be hung. A coat rack often refers {{to a set of}} hooks that are attached to a wall and is mainly used to hang coats and jackets. In a kitchen or bathroom environment the coat rack is often used to hang towels. In some cases, a coat rack refers to a self-standing piece of furniture. The self-standing variant is more often referred to as an <b>hatstand</b> and is mostly used to hang coats, jackets, umbrellas and hats.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hatstand</b> (UK), hatrack (US) or coat rack is {{a device}} used to store hats and often coats on, and {{umbrellas}} within. Some upscale catalogues in Europe market it as a portmanteau from the French words Porter (carry) and Manteau (cloak).|$|E
50|$|The {{common names}} Policeman's Helmet, Bobby Tops, Copper Tops, and Gnome's <b>Hatstand</b> all {{originate}} from the flowers being decidedly hat-shaped. Himalayan Balsam and Kiss-me-on-the-mountain {{arise from the}} plant originating in the Himalayan mountains. Ornamental jewelweed refers to its cultivation as an ornamental plant.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hatstand,</b> Table and Chair are a {{group of}} three erotic sculptures by British pop artist Allen Jones, created in 1969 and first {{exhibited}} in 1970. They have been described in retrospect as [...] "emblematic of the spirit of the 1960s" [...] and an [...] "international sensation." [...] At the time they were met with angry protests, particularly from feminists who saw them as an objectification of women.|$|E
50|$|Stylistically, Lotto used {{expressive}} {{gestures and}} somewhat under-size heads. The number of carefully painted details show {{the influence of}} Northern European paintings: they include the baldachin bed, the small window with sealed glasses, the shelf with a small still life, the <b>hatstand,</b> the stool with an hourglass, the prie-dieu and a scared cat which is fleeing. The baldachin {{was inspired by a}} relief by Andrea Sansovino at Loreto.|$|E
5000|$|... "Sunday Jumps": Astaire {{credits the}} idea for this solo to his long-time choreographic {{collaborator}} Hermes Pan. In it, Astaire parodies himself by dancing with a <b>hatstand</b> and appears to parody his rival and friend Gene Kelly by inserting a mock bodybuilding episode during which he kicks aside some Indian clubs in a reference to Kelly's [...] "Be A Clown" [...] routine with The Nicholas Brothers in The Pirate. The fame of the dance rests on Astaire's ability to animate the inanimate. The solo {{takes place in a}} ship's gym, where Astaire is waiting to rehearse with his partner Powell, who doesn't turn up, echoing Adele Astaire's attitude toward her brother's obsessive rehearsal habits to which the lyrics (unused and unpublished) also made reference. In 1997, Astaire's widow Robyn authorized Dirt Devil to use a digitally altered version of the scene where Astaire dances with a <b>hatstand</b> in a commercial; Astaire's daughter Ava objected publicly to the commercial, implying they had [...] "tarnished his image" [...] and saying it was [...] "the antithesis of everything my lovely, gentle father represented" ...|$|E
5000|$|Jones {{has taught}} at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, the University of South Florida, the University of California, the Banff Center School of Fine Arts in Canada, and the Berlin University of the Arts. His works reside {{in a number of}} collections; {{including}} the Tate, the Museum Ludwig, the Warwick Arts Centre and the Hirshhorn Museum. His best known work <b>Hatstand,</b> Table and Chair, involving fibreglass [...] "fetish" [...] mannequins, debuted to protests in 1970.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hatstand,</b> Table and Chair {{are three}} {{fibreglass}} sculptures of women transformed into items of furniture. They are each dressed with wigs, and are naked {{apart from their}} corsets, gloves and leather boots. Each is slightly larger than life-size. For Chair the woman lies curled on her back, a seat cushion on her thighs and her legs acting as a back rest. Table is a woman on all fours, with a sheet of glass supported on her back. For Hat Stand the woman is standing, 1.85 m tall, her hands upturned as hooks.|$|E
5000|$|Allen Jones {{was one of}} {{the first}} of the 1960s British Pop artists, and {{produced}} paintings and prints. A 1968 set of prints, In Life Class, has been cited as an immediate predecessor of his chair, table and <b>hatstand.</b> Each print is made of two halves, the bottom being a pair of women's legs in tights, the upper halves drawn in a 1940s fetishist graphic style, representing [...] "the secret face of British male desire in the gloomy post-war years". Jones enjoyed combining different visual languages to expose the historical constructions underlying them. He examined the cultural representations of the female body.|$|E
5000|$|Bidmead was {{instructed}} to include a monster in the script, something he was unhappy with since {{he felt that the}} Doctor Who monsters looked [...] "cheap" [...] and had limited dialogue. His two earlier stories, Logopolis and Castrovalva featured no monsters. The Tractators were inspired by woodlice, which had infested his flat. Dancers were hired to wear the Tractator costumes with the idea that they would coil and twist their bodies in line with the idea of woodlice, but the costumes proved too restrictive for this. The dancers were hired from Pineapple Studios. One glitch in the continuity of the series occurs in this story, as companion Kamelion is missing when the TARDIS is destroyed. The writers of The Discontinuity Guide theorise that he is disguised as the <b>hatstand.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Jones {{first group}} of erotic {{fibreglass}} sculptures, of a <b>Hatstand,</b> Table and Chair gained international attention when exhibited in 1970. The works were met with strong protests for perceived misogyny, which succeeded in making Jones a [...] "cultural hot potato". Laura Mulvey writing for Spare Rib magazine suggested the sculptures was inspired by latent castration anxiety. Almost a decade later, when they were put {{on display at the}} Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1978, they were attacked with stink bombs. Eight years later, on International Women's Day, Chair was damaged by paint stripper while exhibited at the Tate. According to art historian and curator, Marco Livingstone, writing in 2004: [...] "More than three decades later, these works still carry a powerful emotive charge, ensnaring every viewer's psychology and sexual outlook regardless of age, gender or experience." ...|$|E
