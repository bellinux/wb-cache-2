5|$|The {{setting was}} principally based on Norway, and the {{cultural}} influences in the film come from Scandinavian culture. Several landmarks in Norway appear in the film, including the Akershus Fortress in Oslo, the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, and Bryggen in Bergen. Numerous other typical cultural Scandinavian elements are {{also included in the}} film, such as stave churches, trolls, Viking ships, a hot spring, Fjord horses, clothes, and food such as lutefisk. A maypole is also present in the film, as well as the brief appearance of runes in a book that Anna and Elsa's father opens to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> trolls live. A scene where two men argue over whether to stack firewood bark up or bark down is a reference to the perennial Norwegian debate over how to stack firewood properly. The film also contains several elements specifically drawn from Sámi culture, such as the usage of reindeer for transportation and the equipment used to control these, clothing styles (the outfits of the ice cutters), and parts of the musical score. Decorations, such as those on the castle pillars and Kristoff's sled, are also in styles inspired by Sámi duodji decorations. During their field work in Norway, Disney's team, for inspiration, visited Rørosrein, a Sámi family-owned company in the village Plassje that produces reindeer meat and arranges tourist events. Arendelle was inspired by Nærøyfjord, a branch of Norway's longest fjord Sognefjorden, which has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; while a castle in Oslo with beautiful hand-painted patterns on all four walls served as the inspiration for the kingdom's royal castle interior.|$|E

5|$|When writing material, {{the band}} would write the music first before {{incorporating}} lyrics. King or Hanneman used a 24-track and drum machine to show band members the riff that they created, {{and to get}} their opinion.

2500|$|Although many {{authors of}} expository writing show a {{predisposition}} to capitalizing the initials {{of the expansion}} for pedagogical emphasis (trying to thrust the reader's attention toward where the letters are coming from), this sometimes conflicts with the convention of English orthography, which reserves capitals {{in the middle of}} sentences for proper nouns. Enforcing the general convention, most professional editors case-fold such expansions to their standard orthography when editing manuscripts for publication.

2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the album shifted when Maida traveled to Sudan and Darfur to shoot a documentary with War Child {{in the middle of}} recording. [...] "We were there for a couple of weeks, and we came back from that and went right back into the studio, and it was like: 'God, this song sucks. I’m not saying that anymore.' You start reflecting on lyrics and any message you’re trying to get out there, and it really altered everything again." [...] The band recorded in six-week spurts, traveling between studios in Toronto, Los Angeles and Maui, recording more songs. With no deadline from the record company, they kept recording and gaining more perspective. [...] "We'd get together, write, record, take two weeks off, go back in and we ended up doing that on and off for the last two-and-a-half or three years," [...] By this time, over forty songs were recorded including [...] "Picture", [...] "Don't Ask Why" [...] (Where Are You), [...] "Holy Ghost" [...] (Angels/Losing/Sleep) and [...] "Vampires", which was briefly considered for the album's title. The sessions became strained at times as the band couldn't <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> album was going. [...] "We had so many songs," [...] said Taggart, [...] "and we just started to go crazy."

40|$|It is {{believed}} that about 90 to 99 % {{of the mass of}} the universe is composed of a non-baryonic, non-luminous substance called dark matter. It is still unknown what exactly dark matter is, but one possible candidate is a population of Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMP). DRIFT 2 a (Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks) is a dark matter detector designed to search for WIMPS. The analysis for DRIFT 2 a involves looking at electric pulses (events) that correspond to ionization inside the detector due to interactions with WIMPs and other particles. One significant problem with those pulses is that due to hardware errors they are asymmetric and have an overshoot. The main purpose of this particular project is {{to find a way to}} get rid of the overshoot through software simulations and manipulations and restore the original correct pulse. This is necessary because once the original symmetric pulses are obtained the ionization due to diffusion inside the detector could be measured. Knowing the effect of diffusion on an electric signal, one can calculate the distance the event occurred from the MWPC (Multi-wire Proportional Chamber ? the ?processor? of the detector). <b>The</b> process of <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> event actually occurred is called Fiducializing the detector and is very important for the data analysis further on...|$|R

40|$|Here {{we propose}} a 'leap foward' with the {{application}} of Position Specific Isotope Analysis to Environmental Forensics, a topic which has a large un-tapped potential for biogeochemical / biodegradation studies. Compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) {{is a relatively new}} methods in Enviornmental Forenscis (<b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> contamination in the environment comes from). PSIA could uncover / unlock the questions that CSIA has opened up and leap-frog our understanding of the fate of contaminants in the environment. Isotopic fractionation is limited to reactions at the site or bond in the contaminant molecule associated with the rate-limiting biodegradation step. These fractionation effects are diluted in 'whole molecule' CSIA by the presence of non-reacting carbon atoms. Intramolecular isotope ratios however would be sensitive to such fractionation effects and could be used to determine the pathways and mechanism of degradation. Leveraging the resources of Prof. Kalin's EPSRC funded Platform Grant therefore provides the 'base-line real-world' access to sites and samples for this proposed 'Speculative Engineering' research, thereby allowing the research proposed here to solely focus on solving the question: Is PSIA useful for Environmental Forensics applications?Current convention would say that PSIA is impracticable for the 'real world', however we challenge this and firmly believe in the potential of this approach. There are many other areas of research that may benefit from a concerted speculative research effort on the Environmental Forensic application of PSIA, the results of which are certain to give some insight into the biogeochemical cycling of contaminant organic compounds released to the environment...|$|R
