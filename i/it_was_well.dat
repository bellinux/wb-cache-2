5|$|A play, The Doom Bar, about {{smuggling}} and wrecking {{was written}} in the early 1900s by Arthur Hansen Bush. Although there was no interest in London <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> received in America, and was scheduled to tour in Chicago and New York. A series of mishaps, blamed on the legendary wrecker Cruel Coppinger, culminating in a fire at Baltimore, caused the play to be considered cursed by America's actors' unions and its members were banned from appearing in it.|$|E

5|$|According to American {{composer}} David Schiff, his compatriot Leonard Bernstein used {{to imply}} that he had single-handedly rescued Mahler from oblivion in 1960, after 50years of neglect. Schiff points out that such neglect was only relative—far less than the (incomplete) disregard of Bach {{in the years after}} his death. Although Bernstein gave the Mahler revival further impetus, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> under way before 1960, sustained by conductors such as Stokowski, Dimitri Mitropoulos and John Barbirolli, and by the long-time Mahler advocate Aaron Copland.|$|E

5|$|Crawford {{continued}} her reign {{as a popular}} movie actress well into the mid-1930s. No More Ladies (1935) co-starred Robert Montgomery and then-husband Franchot Tone, and was a success. Crawford had long pleaded with MGM's head Louis B. Mayer to cast her in more dramatic roles, and although he was reluctant, he cast her in the sophisticated comedy-drama I Live My Life (1935), directed by W.S. Van Dyke. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> received by critics and made a larger profit than the studio had expected.|$|E

5|$|DiCaprio {{appeared}} in the mostly improvised short film called Don's Plum, {{as a favor to}} aspiring director R. D. Robb. When Robb decided to expand the black-and-white film to feature length, however, DiCaprio and costar Tobey Maguire had its release blocked by court order, arguing that they never intended to make it a theatrical release, as it would have commercial value thanks to their stardom. The film eventually premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival, where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> received by critics. DiCaprio's last film of the year 1995 was The Basketball Diaries, a biographical film about Jim Carroll.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a period}} of {{personal}} and legal troubles with drug addiction, Gil Scott-Heron recorded and released his first album of original material in sixteen years, I'm New Here (2010), {{with the assistance of}} XL Recordings-label head Richard Russell. Produced by Russell, the album served as a departure from Scott-Heron's earlier work, both musically and thematically, eschewing its soul, jazz, and funk styles and social commentary for more personal, reflective lyrics with ruminations on love, loss, and identity, set to contemporary electronic music. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> received by fans and music critics, who viewed it as a comeback for Scott-Heron.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether the tribe had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and drew the same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to be resolved in the favor of the tribe, citing The Menominee Tribe of Indians v.

In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the tribe had agreed {{to the site of the}} reservation was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> suited for hunting, with plenty of game.
