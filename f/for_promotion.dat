5|$|In the 1926–27 season, Cowan made 27 {{appearances}} as {{his club}} sought an immediate {{return to the}} top division. The race <b>for</b> <b>promotion</b> went to the final match, with Manchester City and Portsmouth both in contention for {{the second of the}} two promotion places. Cowan played in a resounding City win, an 8–0 victory against Bradford City. The watching crowd believed the result to be sufficient <b>for</b> <b>promotion,</b> but Portsmouth's match had been delayed by 15 minutes and was still in progress. A late Portsmouth goal meant the final scoreline in their match was a 5–1 win, enough to give Portsmouth second place on goal average by a margin of one two-hundredth of a goal. The club won the Second Division championship the following season, gaining promotion to the top flight. The Second Division championship was Cowan's first honour in professional football.|$|E

5|$|This period {{also saw}} a {{significant}} expansion in Georgia Tech's postgraduate education programs, driven largely by the Cold War and the launch of Sputnik; this effort received substantial support from the EES. Despite its slow start, with the first Master of Science programs in the 1920s and the first Doctorate in 1946, the program became firmly established. In 1952 alone, around 80 students earned graduate degrees while working at EES. Herschel H. Cudd, EES director from 1952 to 1954, created a new promotion system for researchers that is still in use. Many EES researchers held the title of professor despite lacking a doctorate (or a comparable qualification <b>for</b> <b>promotion</b> {{as determined by the}} Georgia Board of Regents), something that irritated members of the teaching faculty. The new system, approved in spring 1953, used the Board of Regents' qualifications <b>for</b> <b>promotion</b> and mirrored the academic tenure track.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1677, Royal Navy {{regulations}} <b>for</b> <b>promotion</b> to lieutenant required {{service as}} a midshipman, and promotion to midshipman required some time at sea.

While playing for Birmingham, Bruce was the subject of several bids from his old Manchester United colleague Bryan Robson to sign for Middlesbrough, but the transfer never happened.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, {{four types}} of {{midshipman}} existed: midshipman (original rating), midshipman extraordinary, midshipman (apprentice officer), and midshipman ordinary. Some midshipmen were older men, and while most were officer candidates who failed to pass the lieutenant examination or were passed over <b>for</b> <b>promotion,</b> {{some members of the}} original rating served, as late as 1822, alongside apprentice officers without themselves aspiring to a commission. By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.|$|E

5|$|During {{the long}} period of peace between 1815 and 1846 midshipmen had few {{opportunities}} <b>for</b> <b>promotion,</b> and their warrants were often obtained via patronage. The poor quality of officer training in the US Navy became visible after the Somers Affair, an alleged mutiny aboard the training ship USS Somers in 1842, and the subsequent execution of midshipman Philip Spencer. Spencer had gained his post aboard the Somers via the influence of his father, United States Secretary of War John C. Spencer.|$|E
