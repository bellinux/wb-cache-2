2500|$|The word {{gymnasium}} is the latinisation of the Greek noun γυμνάσιον (gymnasion), [...] "gymnastic school", <b>in</b> <b>pl.</b> [...] "bodily exercises" [...] {{and generally}} [...] "school" [...] {{which in turn}} is derived from the common Greek adjective [...] (gymnos) meaning [...] "naked", by way of the related verb γυμνάζω (gymnazo), whose meaning is [...] "to train naked", [...] "train in gymnastic exercise", generally [...] "to train, to exercise". The verb had this meaning because one undressed for exercise. Historically, the gymnasium was used for exercise, communal bathing, and scholarly and philosophical pursuits. The English noun gymnast, first recorded in 1594, is formed from the Greek γυμναστής (gymnastēs), but in Greek this word means [...] "trainer" [...] not [...] "gymnast". The palaistra was the part of the gymnasium devoted to wrestling, boxing and ball games.|$|E
60|$|General Appearance.--The {{capitulum}} (seen {{from above}} <b>in</b> <b>Pl.</b> III, fig. 4 a) is slightly compressed, almost globular, composed of thick membrane, with two large, ear-like, flexible, tubular, folded appendages, {{at the upper}} end, opening into the sack. These appendages are seated behind the rudimentary terga when such are present, or behind the spots which they would have held if not aborted. In a young condition they are tubular, but not folded; and often, according to Prof. Macgillivray, either one or both are at first imperforate. They are formed externally of the outer membrane of the capitulum (rendered thin where folded), and internally of a prolongation of the inner tunic of the sack; between the two, there is, as around the whole sack, a double layer of corium. A section across both appendages, near their bases, is given <b>in</b> <b>Pl.</b> III, fig. 4 b, showing how they are folded,--the chief fold being directed from below upwards, with a smaller fold, not always present, from between the two, outwards. The folds sometimes do not exactly correspond {{on opposite sides of}} the same individual; they are almost confined to the lower part, the orifice itself being often simply tubular. These appendages are sometimes very nearly as long as the whole capitulum: a section near their bases is sub-triangular. I shall presently make some remarks on their functions and manner of formation.|$|E
60|$|Mouth.--The {{mouth is}} well developed; it is {{represented}} as seen vertically from above, <b>in</b> <b>Pl.</b> V, fig. 2, magnified about 60 times; {{the positions of}} the cirri and the outline of the thorax are accurately shown by dotted lines; a lateral view is given in fig. 1. In the specimen figured, the longitudinal diameter of the mouth, including the labrum, was 5/400th of an inch. The muscles of the several trophi have transverse striæ, and are the strongest and most conspicuous of any in the body. The labrum is largely bullate, with its summit slightly concave; the trophi are arranged in a remarkable manner, in a semicircular line, so as to be opposed to the labrum rather than to each other: there are no teeth or spines on the crest of the labrum, which overhangs the oesophageal cavity.|$|E

60|$|Alimentary Canal.--The {{oesophagus}} is very narrow, and {{of remarkable}} length; from the orifice under the mandibles, it first runs back (in this respect not well represented <b>in</b> <b>Pl.</b> V, fig. 1,) under the bullate labrum, and then {{straight down the}} peduncle, where it terminates in the usual bell-shaped expansion, entering {{one side of the}} small globular stomach; the latter, at its lower end, is slightly constricted, and then is rather abruptly upturned. The rectum is of unparalleled length, and extremely narrow; it can be best detected after the dissolution by caustic potash of the softer parts, when its inner coat of chitine can be seen to be continuous, in the ordinary manner, with the outer integuments of the thorax. The anus, as already stated, is seated on a slight swelling, and consists of a small longitudinal slit (f, fig. 2), placed close outside the two very minute caudal appendages.|$|E
60|$|Attachment.--The {{surface of}} {{attachment}} is wide: the two cement-ducts, after {{running down the}} sides of the peduncle in a sinuous course, within the longitudinal muscles and close outside the ovarian tubes, pass through the corium, and then separately form the most abrupt loops or folds. These are represented <b>in</b> <b>Pl.</b> IX, fig. 2, in which a space about 1/10th of an inch square is given, as seen from the outside. At each of the bends, an aperture has been formed through the membrane of the peduncle, and cement poured forth. The manner in which the discs of cement (b) come out of the two ducts (a a), and reach the external surface, is shown in the section, figure 2 a´. The two tubes are firmly attached to the older layers of membrane, and are covered by the last-formed layers. In a young specimen, the cement-ducts were a little above 2/2000ths of an inch in diameter, which had increased, in a medium-sized specimen, to 5/2000. The cement-glands are retort-shaped, seated near each other, high up in the peduncle.|$|E
60|$|The one full-grown {{specimen}} of S. rostratum, in Mr. Cuming's collection, {{was in a}} good state of preservation, but dry. The three parasites were attached, as stated, close under the labrum, {{between it and the}} adductor muscle. They are constructed like ordinary Cirripedia, and have a mouth, thorax and cirri, enclosed in a capitulum, supported on a peduncle of moderate length and narrow. The entire length of the capitulum and peduncle, as far as could be ascertained in the shrivelled condition of the specimens, was 35/1000ths, and the greatest width of the capitulum 11/1000ths of an inch. Both capitulum and peduncle are hirsute with spines, nearly 1/1000th of an inch in length, mingled with shorter hairs in little rows of three and four together. The figure (5) <b>in</b> <b>Pl.</b> VI is merely a restoration, as accurate as could be made from the much shrivelled specimens. There are only three valves,--namely, an oval carina (a), seated rather high up on the capitulum, in a rudimentary condition and only 1/1000th of an inch in length, and a pair of scuta; these latter consist of a narrow, slightly curved plate, 8/1000ths in length, broadest at the lower end, where the breadth is 2/1000ths of an inch. The prehensile antennæ, {{at the end of the}} peduncle, have pointed hoof-like discs: I was not able to make out the other parts. It deserves notice, that in the young {{specimen of}} the ordinary form of S. rostratum, 1/10th of an inch in length, and therefore only thrice as long as the parasites, all the valves were perfect, and seemed to have followed the ordinary law of development.|$|E

60|$|The male organs {{have been}} well {{described}} by M. Martin St. Ange, whose observations have since been confirmed by R. Wagner.[18] The testes are small, often leaden-coloured, either pear or finger-shaped, or branched like club-moss,--these several forms sometimes occurring in the same individual; they coat the stomach, enter the pedicels, and even the basal segments of the rami of the cirri, and in some genera occupy certain swellings on the thorax and prosoma, and in others the filamentary appendages: the testes seen in the apex {{in one of these}} appendages in Conchoderma, is represented <b>in</b> <b>Pl.</b> IX, fig. 5. The two vesiculæ seminales are very large; they lie along the abdominal surface of the thorax, and generally (but not in some species of Scalpellum) enter the prosoma, where their broad ends are often reflexed; here the branched vessels leading from the testes enter. The membrane of the vesiculæ seminales is formed of circular fibres; and is, I presume, contractile, for I have seen the spermatozoa expelled with force from the cut end of a living specimen. The two canals leading from the vesiculæ generally unite in a single duct {{at the base of the}} penis; but in Conchoderma aurita, half-way up it. The probosciformed penis, except in certain species of Scalpellum, is very long; it is capable of the most varied movements; it is generally hairy, especially at the end; it is supported on a straight unarticulated basis, which in Ibla quadrivalvis alone (Pl. IV, fig. 9 a), is of considerable length; in this species, the upper part is seen to be as plainly articulated as one of the cirri; in Alepas, the articulations are somewhat less plain, and in the other genera, the organ can be said only to be finely ringed, but these rings no doubt are in fact obscure articulations. In the females of Ibla Cumingii and Scalpellum ornatum, there is, of course, no penis.|$|E
60|$|The Cirri are {{developed}} at first of considerable length, {{so that the}} young animal may soon provide itself with food; in Lepas australis they are of great length, the sixth pair consisting of seventeen or eighteen obscure segments. The extreme tips of the twenty-four rami of the six pair of cirri, are formed within the twenty-four, corresponding, little, bi-segmental rami of the six pair of natatory legs; but as the cirri are many times longer than these legs, they occupy in a bundle the whole thorax of the larva; no part whatever of the thorax of the Cirripede is formed within the thorax of the larva, but (together with the pedicels of the anterior cirri) within the cephalic cavity. As a consequence of this, the longitudinal axis of the thorax of the young Cirripede lies almost transversely to the longitudinal axis of the larva; and the Cirripede, from this transverse position of its thorax, comes to be, as it were, internally, almost cut in twain, and the sack thus produced. As soon as the young Cirripede is free and can move itself, the cirri are curled up, and the thorax is advanced towards the orifice of the capitulum, its longitudinal axis resuming the position of approximate parallelism to the longitudinal axis of the whole body, which {{it had in the}} larval condition. The reader will, perhaps, understand what I mean, if he will look at the mature Cirripede, figured <b>in</b> <b>Pl.</b> IX, fig. 4. In this, he will see that the body or thorax is united to the peduncle only by a small part below the mouth; on the other hand, if he imagines the whole bottom of the body (as high up as the letter h) united and blended into the peduncle, he will see the state in which these parts exist in the larva. Now, let him greatly shorten the cirri, so as to resemble the natatory legs of the larva, and then imagine a young Cirripede, with cirri of full length, formed within the old one, he will see that the new thorax supporting the cirri will have to be developed in an almost transverse position,--the animal consequently being internally almost separated into twain.|$|E
60|$|General Remarks.--As {{there are}} only two species as yet known, and as these {{resemble}} each other in every respect most closely, a generic description would be a useless repetition of the full details given under Ibla Cumingii. I have taken this latter species as the type, from having, owing to the kindness of Mr. Cuming, better and more numerous specimens. Ibla and Lithotrya are the only two recent genera in which the body of the animal is lodged within the peduncle; but there is no distinction of any importance, though useful for classification, between the capitulum and peduncle; and these two parts, as we have seen, tend to blend together in some species of Conchoderma and Alepas. The entire absence of calcareous matter in the valves and spines of the peduncle, at first appears very remarkable; but we have seen a similar fact in Alepas, and there is an approach to it in some varieties of Conchoderma aurita and C. virgata. In all four valves of Ibla, the umbones, or centres of growth, are at their upper points. The horny spines on the peduncle, are the analogues of the calcareous scales in Scalpellum and Pollicipes; and in this latter genus, two of the species have their scales, almost cylindrical, placed irregularly, with new ones forming over all parts of the surface, and not exclusively at the summit,--in which several respects there is an agreement with Ibla. The shape of the body (i. e. thorax and prosoma, Pl. IV, fig. 8 a´) is peculiar; but it is only a slight exaggeration of what we have seen in several genera, and shall meet again in some species of Scalpellum. The presence of hairs on the outer membrane of the prosoma is a peculiarity confined to this genus amongst the Lepadidæ, though observed in the sessile genus, Chthamalus. The caudal appendages in the I. quadrivalvis attain a greater length than in any other species of the family, being four times the length of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus. A far more important peculiarity is the fact of the oesophagus, in both species, running over or exteriorly to the adductor scutorum muscle, instead of, as in every other species, close under this muscle. I took great pains in ascertaining the truth of this singular anomaly: the course of the oesophagus is approximately represented <b>in</b> <b>Pl.</b> IV, fig. 8 a´ by faint dotted lines. The stomach has no cæca; the biliary folds are longitudinal; there is a marked constriction at the line corresponding with the junction of the thorax and prosoma. There are no filamentary appendages.|$|E

On the other hand a synod of learned Mussulmans {{is said to have}} decreed that as beverages of Kat and Cafta do not impair the health or impede the observance of religious duties, but only increase hilarity and good- humour, it was lawful to use them, as also the drink made from the boon or coffee-berry. I am not aware that Kat is used in Aden in any other way than for mastication. From what I have heard, however, I believe that a decoction resembling tea is made from the leaf by the Arabs in the interior; and one who is well acquainted with our familiar beverage assures me that the effects are not unlike those produced by strong green tea, with this advantage in favour of Kat, that the excitement is always of a pleasing and agreeable kind. [Note: [...] "Mr. Vaughan has transmitted two specimens called Tubbare Kat and Muktaree Kat, from the districts in which they are produced: the latter fetches the lower price. Catha edulis Forsk., Nat. Ord. Celastraceae, is figured in Dr. Lindley's Vegetable Kingdom, p. 588. (London, 1846). But there is a still more complete representation of the plant under the name of Catha Forskalii Richard, in a work published {{under the auspices of the}} French government, entitled, 'Voyage en Abyssinie execute pendant les annees 1839-43, par une commission scientifique composee de MM. Theophile Lefebvre, Lieut. du Vaisseau, A. Petit et Martin-Dillon, docteurs medecins, naturalistes du Museum, Vignaud dessinateur.' The botanical portion of this work, by M. Achille Richard, is regarded either as a distinct publication under the title of Tentamen Florae Abyssinicae, or as a part of the Voyage en Abyssinie. M. Richard enters into some of the particulars relative to the synonyms of the plant, from which it appears that Vahl referred Forskal's genus Catha to the Linnaean genus Celastrus, changing the name of Catha edulis to Celastrus edulis. Hochstetter applied the name of Celastrus edulis to an Abyssinian species (Celastrus obscurus Richard), which he imagined identical with Forskal's Catha edulis, while of the real Catha edulis Forsk., he formed a new genus and species, under the name of Trigonotheca serrata Hochs. Nat. Ord. Hippocrateaceae. I quote the following references from the Tentamen Florae Abyssinicae, vol. i. p. 134.: 'Catha Forskalii Nob. Catha No. 4. Forsk. loc. cit, (Flor. AEgypt. Arab. p. 63.) Trigonotheca serrata Hochs. <b>in</b> <b>pl.</b> Schimp. Abyss. sect. ii, No. 649. Celastrus edulis Vahl, Ecl. 1. 21.' Although In the Flora AEgyptiaco-Arabica of Forskal no specific name is applied to the Catha at p. 63, it is enumerated as Catha edulis at p. 107. The reference to Celastrus edulis is not contained in the Eclogae Americanae of Vahl, but in the author's Symbolae Botanicae (Hanulae, 1790, fol.) pars i. p. 21. (Daniel Hanbury signed.)] ...|$|E
60|$|Attachment.--Specimens are {{attached}} to various horny corallines, and occasionally to the peduncles of each other.[51] In both cases, supposing the coralline to be erect, the capitulum is placed upwards, with its orifice towards the branch {{to which it is}} attached, and consequently with its carina outwards. Where several are crowded in a group, their peduncles often become twisted and their positions irregular, with their orifices facing in any direction. This uniform position is simply the consequence of the larva attaching itself head-downwards, and from the position of the prehensile antennæ, necessarily with its sternal surface parallel and close to the branch of the coralline; hence the dorsal surface, which afterwards is converted into the carina, faces outwards. The peduncle, as already stated, often tapers, at its basal extremity, to a sharp point. In very young specimens, for instance in one with a capitulum only 1/20th of an inch in length, the method of attachment is the same as in Lepas and many other genera, namely, by cement proceeding exclusively from the antennæ of the larva; but in older and full-grown specimens, instead of the whole bottom of the peduncle becoming flattened and broadly attached, which would be here impossible, the cement is poured out through a straight row of orifices along the rostral edge, thus causing, by an excellent adaptation, a narrow margin to adhere firmly to the thin and cylindrical branches of the coralline. These orifices are represented, magnified seven times, <b>in</b> <b>Pl.</b> IX, fig. 7, in which the lower attached portion of the peduncle is split open and exhibited; they are circular, and stand at regular intervals, in a straight line; the higher orifices are larger, but further apart from each other than the lower ones; in one full-grown specimen, I counted ten of these orifices in a length of exactly a quarter of an inch. At each period of growth, the corium recedes a little from the attached portion of the peduncle; of which portion, the greater part is thus left empty and as incapable of further growth, as are the larval antennæ at the extreme point: in the specimen figured, the corium extended a little below the upper orifice. The prehensile antennæ, however, I must remark, do not strictly rise from the extreme point of the peduncle, but at a little distance from it, on the rostral surface; this simply ensues from the antennæ in the larva, being situated on the sternal surface, close to, but not actually {{on the front of the}} head. The two cement glands are seated high up on the sides of the peduncle, and remote from each other; they are small, unusually globular and transparent. The two cement-ducts (fig. 7 a a) proceeding from them, are 3/2000ths of an inch in diameter, and run in a zig-zag line; at the point where they pass through the corium to enter the lower attached portion of the peduncle, they become closely approximated, and partially imbedded in the membrane of the peduncle. Together they run along the rostral edge, giving out through each orifice a little disc of brownish cement, and finally they enter the larval antennæ. The peduncle, just above the attached portion, where still lined by corium, no doubt increases in diameter at each period of growth, and must, I presume, become pressed against the almost parallel branch of the coralline. The corium, at this same period, shrinks, or is absorbed, and the two cement-ducts come in contact with, and adhere to, the inner surface of the outer membrane of the peduncle; and then, by a process which I do not understand in this or any other Cirripede, apertures are formed both in the ducts and through the membrane, so that the cement passes through, firmly fastening the outer surface of the peduncle with its calcareous scales and spines, to the coralline.|$|E
