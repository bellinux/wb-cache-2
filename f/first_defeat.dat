5|$|The 1919 {{season began}} with high expectations; World War I was over, and key players had {{returned}} from service. However, things did not go Warner's way; {{at the beginning of}} the season, problems with the offensive line and on the flanks became apparent.

On 1 November 1914, the ships destroyed a British force at the Battle of Coronel and inflicted upon the Royal Navy its <b>first</b> <b>defeat</b> since the Battle of Plattsburgh in 1814. The East Asia Squadron, including both Scharnhorst-class ships, was subsequently annihilated at the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 2003, Arsenal {{opened up}} an eight-point lead {{at the top}} of the table, winning 2–0 against Charlton Athletic. The result was enough for Irish {{bookmaker}} Paddy Power to pay out on punters backing Arsenal to retain their lead, despite Manchester United having a game in hand. The gap was cut to two points after Arsenal suffered their <b>first</b> <b>defeat</b> in 2003, against Blackburn Rovers. By the time Arsenal played Everton on 23 March 2003, they were displaced {{at the top of}} the table by Manchester United. A goal by Vieira moved the team two points clear once more.|$|E

A solo goal by Henry at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu in the first leg, inflicted the home team's <b>first</b> <b>defeat</b> in 18 Champions League matches.

5|$|The only goal of {{the match}} came in the second half; Arsenal {{substitute}} Gilberto Silva on his debut collected a pass from Dennis Bergkamp and struck the ball through goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek's legs. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger praised the match-winner in his post-match interview, while opposing manager Gérard Houllier felt {{the result showed that}} his team needed more game time and attention to passing, in order to improve. The result meant Arsenal was the first team to win the Shield outright 11 times, while it marked Liverpool's <b>first</b> <b>defeat</b> at the Millennium Stadium.|$|E
5|$|This result marked Manchester United's <b>first</b> <b>defeat</b> of 1999. It was {{the second}} {{consecutive}} year that Arsenal beat United to win the Charity Shield.

United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, on the other hand, believed the defeat highlighted his players needed more game time.|$|E
5|$|Earl Ralph {{had secured}} {{control of the}} castle at Dol, and in September 1076 William {{advanced}} into Brittany and laid siege to the castle. King Philip of France later relieved the siege and defeated William at Dol, forcing him to retreat back to Normandy. Although this was William's <b>first</b> <b>defeat</b> in battle, it did little to change things. An Angevin attack on Maine was defeated in late 1076 or 1077, with Count Fulk le Rechin wounded in the unsuccessful attack. More serious was the retirement of Simon de Crépy, the Count of Amiens, to a monastery. Before he became a monk, Simon handed his county of the Vexin over to King Philip. The Vexin was a buffer state between Normandy and the lands of the French king, and Simon had been a supporter of William. William {{was able to make}} peace with Philip in 1077 and secured a truce with Count Fulk in late 1077 or early 1078.|$|E

5|$|Expectations {{were high}} with head coach António José Conceição Oliveira (Toni), {{who had been}} part of Benfica's wins in 1988–89 and 1993–94, {{starting}} his third complete season with the team. In the transfer market, the club shipped out regular starters from the past seasons and brought in new players, mixing the experience of Zlatko Zahovič and Ljubinko Drulović with acquisitions Pedro Mantorras and Simão Sabrosa. By December the team was still in the title race after seven wins and seven draws. However, that month the team suffered its <b>first</b> <b>defeat,</b> a close draw against Sporting, and their exit from the Taça de Portugal. These setbacks caused Toni to resign and be replaced by his assistant, Jesualdo Ferreira. After the change, Ferreira guided the team to third-place by late March, where several injuries in key players impacted their momentum. They finished the season with 17 wins, twelve draws and five losses, putting them in fourth place and keeping them out of the European league for another year.|$|E

Clemson was ranked nationally No. 5 at the time, and the Tigers suffered their <b>first</b> <b>defeat</b> of the season {{at the hands of}} the Yellow Jackets. Tevin Washington led the Yellow Jackets to a 31–17 upset victory by rushing for 176 yards on 27 carries and a touchdown, which was the most rushing yards ever by a Georgia Tech quarterback. In addition, Clemson's offense was almost completely shutdown by Georgia Tech's defense in the first half, and the Tigers were plagued by turnovers, which contributed to the win for the Yellow Jackets.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} 16 of the competition, Luton faced Ipswich Town of the Second Division. Without several senior players because of ineligibility and injury, Luton scored early through Brian Stein's strike, and then {{produced}} a solid defensive performance, reliant on goalkeeper Les Sealey {{to earn a}} place in the quarter-finals. The result marked Ipswich's <b>first</b> <b>defeat</b> of the season, having earlier recorded 10 wins and two draws at Portman Road. Luton hosted Bradford City in the fifth round of the competition on 19 January 1988. A mistake by Bradford goalkeeper Paul Tomlinson handed Luton the lead four minutes before the hour, when he gave away a free kick for handling the ball in his area. A shot from Danny Wilson in the 65th minute resulted in Luton's second goal; though his effort was saved by Tomlinson, the goalkeeper could not fend off the advancing Harford's header.|$|E
