[...] MIL-STD-810G, released in late 2008, Test Method 527, calls for multiple exciter testing. The vibration test fixture used to attach the DUT to the shaker table must be designed for the frequency range of the vibration test spectrum. Generally for smaller fixtures and lower frequency ranges, the designer targets a <b>fixture</b> <b>design</b> that is free of resonances in the test frequency range.

40|$|The <b>design</b> of {{machining}} <b>fixtures</b> is {{a highly}} complex process that heavily relies on designer experience and his/her implicit knowledge to achieve a good design. The determination of fixturing scheme is an optimizing problem with multi-objective and multiconstraint. In order to evaluate the fixturing scheme objectively, a <b>fixturing</b> <b>design</b> scheme selection objective system is developed according to the feature of multi-level and multi-index of <b>fixturing</b> <b>design</b> scheme. With location accuracy, contact force, workpiece deformation and successive fixturing as the objective functions, the optimization selection of mathematical model of <b>fixturing</b> <b>design</b> scheme is established, then it is solved by gray relation analysis and analytic hierarchy process. The method provides a qualitative and quantitative combining analysis for a <b>fixturing</b> <b>design</b> scheme: (a) verifying whether a particular fixturing scheme is valid with respect to locating stability, deterministic workpiece location, clamping stability and total restraint and (b) determining the optimal fitness value based on integrate performances.
