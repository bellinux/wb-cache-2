25|$|The 2009 Lisbon Treaty created two {{different}} ways for further amendments of the European Union treaties: an ordinary revision procedure which is broadly similar to the past revision process in that it involves convening an intergovernmental conference, and a simplified revision procedure whereby Part three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which deals with internal policy and action of the Union, could be amended by a unanimous decision of the European Council, provided there is no change to the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> of the EU, and subject to ratification by all member states in the usual manner.|$|E

He succeeded in obtaining a letter of encouragement from Cardinal John Joseph Wright, Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Clergy, but there was no approval from the Vatican congregation responsible for raising an association to the level desired by Lefebvre. Cardinal Wright's letter, dated 18 February 1971, said with regard to the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> of Cardinal Wright's own Congregation, that the association [...] "will be able to contribute much to accomplishing the plan drawn up by this Congregation for worldwide sharing of clergy".
