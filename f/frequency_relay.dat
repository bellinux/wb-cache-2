This coordination strategy is proposed {{for supporting the}} frequency stability and protecting the islanded MG against high-frequency deviations, which increased recently due to high penetration of (RESs), random load variations, and system uncertainty. These changes threaten the MG dynamic security and can cause under/over frequency relaying and disconnect some loads and generations, which may lead to cascading failure and system collapse. The simulations results proved that the proposed coordination has been achieved an effective performance for maintaining the MG dynamic security. Whereas, the LFC has been succeeded to readjust the frequency deviations to its allowable limits under different conditions of transients, load disturbances, and RESs penetration levels. However, in some cases of large disturbances and high RESs penetration, the LFC cannot maintain the frequency stability as the frequency fluctuates beyond the normal limits.

The active power deficit is covered by the battery, which changes its operation mode to discharge mode. As a result, the frequency decreases linearly and the converter of the PV increases the injected active power. At t =  6.6  s, the frequency becomes equal to 49.67  Hz (i.e. SoC =  60  %), and the wind generators reconnect to the microgrid, forming again a new combination of active power among the DERs. Since the microgrid load consumption can be fulfilled {{and there is a}} surplus of active power, the battery control changes to charging operation mode, as is shown in Fig.  7. The SoC of the battery increases, causing a respective increase in the common frequency. When the frequency exceeds 50.67  Hz, the PV converter decreases linearly its injected active power. When the frequency reaches 51  Hz (at t =  13.7  s), the PV zeroes its output, while the WGs disconnect from the microgrid, {{in order to protect the}} battery from overcharging.|$|E

Without eliminating the DSI properly, we can hardly analyzing the partial discharge accurately. Among the existing tools, adaptive filter receives much more attention than others, due to its ability of suppressing DSI without needing the prior knowledge of the interference frequency. In this contribution, we employ it to eliminate the DSI in partial discharge detection. For DSI with single main frequency, adaptive filter does work. However, when the number of main frequency increases from one to more, the performance of the filter degrades. In some case, it even diverges, without output. For solving this problem, we incorporate Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with the common adaptive filter, and propose a new scheme for suppressing DSI. By EMD, the DSI with multi-frequency are adaptively decomposed into different Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF), with different frequency component into different IMF. In this way, the problem of suppressing multi-frequency DSI is reduced to the problem of suppressing single-frequency DSI, and accordingly, the problem can be solved with ease...|$|E

Furthermore, sudden load events, and short circuits caused large frequency fluctuations, which threaten the system security and could lead to complete blackouts as well as damages to the system equipment.

Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of the presented technique was examined by varying the penetration level of RESs and reducing the system inertia.

Therefore, power systems designers are seeking to apply digital devices to handle the increasing complexity of power system, which improve the cost and usability. Subsequently, the digital technology has appeared in the protection system of microprocessor relays since 1980 and developing to those with communications interfaces in the a 990 s [20]. Today, digital relays have featured with high speed communication, which helped in replacing wires for safety interlocking, control and also circuit breakers tripping action. Furthermore, there are many applications of digital relays in transmission and generation system protection due to their flexibility, high performance level, and capability of operating under different temperatures compared to the classical electromechanical relays. Therefore, this study focuses on the digital protection device, (e.g. OUFR) to be coordinated with LFC for MG dynamic security. There are several studies have dealt this problem from the short circuit fault side only such as, the optimized time-based coordination of conventional over-current relays; which is the earliest protection technique for utility grids including micro-grids [21]. This method has a limit in its ability of multi-relay protection because of its high sensitivity to components parameters in high fault levels. Sheng et al. [22] presented a multi-agent method depend on assumptions of high fault current levels. However, this method has been developed to island the MG for any fault in the utility grid and also disconnecting most of distributed generations (DGs) for faults within the MG. Furthermore, some studies handled the frequency protection problems such as; Laghariet et al. [23] applied an intelligent computational technique for load shedding of the power system under faulted conditions. Moreover, Komsan and Naowarat [24] discussed the same issue by using the rate of change under <b>frequency</b> <b>relay</b> to improve the load shedding scheme in MGs. Further, Freitas et al. [25] presented a comparative study of the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and vector surge relays for distributed generation applications. However, they faced a very hard task in relays coordination as their design may not detect the islanded conditions within the required time. Teimourzadeh et al. [26] introduced a new Region of Attraction (ROA) based protection zone for the detection of MG security status. However, the proposed approach is an efficient index for providing a quick detection of MG security status. Jose Vieira et al. in [27] proposed the coordination of ROCOF and under/over frequency relays. However, this presented coordination has a drawback, which it did not compensate the frequency fluctuations within the allowable frequency limit due to the action of the relay is energized when the system frequency become out of the allowable limit. Such a problem can be overcome by designing the proposed coordination strategy of LFC and digital OUFR for an islanded MG system dynamic security.|$|E
