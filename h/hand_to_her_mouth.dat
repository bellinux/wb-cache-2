60|$|The {{sociology}} instructor was new. He was married, {{and therefore}} taboo, {{but he had}} come from Boston, he had lived among poets and socialists and Jews and millionaire uplifters at the University Settlement in New York, {{and he had a}} beautiful white strong neck. He led a giggling class through the prisons, the charity bureaus, the employment agencies of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Trailing {{at the end of the}} line Carol was indignant at the prodding curiosity of the others, their manner of staring at the poor as at a Zoo. She felt herself a great liberator. She put her <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> her forefinger and thumb quite painfully pinching her lower lip, and frowned, and enjoyed being aloof.|$|E

I had a little inspiration, since I saw you, but there doesn't seems to be {{anything}} in it, so far." [...] He addressed himself to Clementina, but he included Gregory in what he said. [...] "It struck me {{that he might have}} been running his board, and had used this drowning episode as a blind. But I've been around to his hotel, and he's settled up, all fair and square enough. The landlord tried to think of something he hadn't paid, but he couldn't; and I never saw a man try harder, either." [...] Clementina smiled; she put her <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> to keep from laughing; but Gregory frowned his distress in the untimely droning.|$|E
60|$|My wife here put her <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and {{pronounced}} the incredible sum in a whisper, with {{a species of}} sacred awe, common, as I have observed, to females in such interesting crises. In fact Mr. Ketchem, standing smiling and amiable by, remarked to me that really he hoped Mrs. Crowfield would not name generally what she gave for the article, for positively it was so far below the usual rate of prices that he might give offense to other customers; {{but this was the}} very last of the pattern, and they were anxious to close off the old stock, and we had always traded with them, and he had a great respect for my wife's father, who had always traded with their firm, and so, when there were any little bargains to be thrown in any one's way, why, he naturally, of course--And here Mr. Ketchem bowed gracefully over the yardstick to my wife, and I consented.|$|E

The Ex maintained Rodchenko's format, swapping Brik out for each record's primary vocalist and filling in the record's song titles and issue number, 6.1 through 6.6, as the shouted text. The corners of each record's cover bore the band's name {{along with those of}} any guests appearing on the recording.|$|R

60|$|No doubt, as a kinsman of the house, Mr. Esmond thought {{fit to be}} {{the last}} of all in it; he {{remained}} after the coaches had rolled away--after his dowager aunt's chair and flambeaux had marched off in the darkness towards Chelsey, and the town's people had gone to bed, who had been drawn into the square to gape at the unusual assemblage of chairs and chariots, lackeys, and torchmen. The poor mean wretch lingered yet for a few minutes, to see whether the girl would vouchsafe him a smile, or a parting word of consolation. But her enthusiasm of the morning was quite died out, or she chose to be in a different mood. She fell to joking about the dowdy appearance of Lady Betty, and mimicked the vulgarity of Mrs. Steele; and then she put up her little <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and yawned, lighted a taper, and shrugged her shoulders, and dropping Mr. Esmond a saucy curtsy, sailed off to bed.|$|E
60|$|When {{she reached}} the end of the long bridge she looked anxiously up the street by which she knew that he must come, endeavouring to {{discover}} his figure by the glimmering light of an oil-lamp that hung at an angle in the street, or by the brighter glare which came from the gas in a shop-window by which he must pass. She stood thus looking and looking till she thought he would never come. Then she heard the clock in the old watch-tower of the bridge over her head strike three-quarters, and she became aware that, instead of her lover being after his time, she had yet to wait a quarter of an hour for the exact moment which he had appointed. She did not in the least mind waiting. She had been a little uneasy when she thought that he had neglected or forgotten his own appointment. So she turned again and walked back towards the Kleinseite, fixing her eyes, as she had so often done, on the rows of windows which glittered along the great dark mass of the Hradschin Palace. What were they all doing up there, those slow and faded courtiers to an ex-Emperor, that they should want to burn so many candles? Thinking of this she passed the tablet on the bridge, and, according to her custom, put the end of her fingers on it. But as she was raising her <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> to kiss it she remembered that the saint might not like such service from one who was already half a Jew at heart, and she refrained. She refrained, and then considered whether the bridge might not topple down with her into the stream because of her iniquity. But it did not topple down, and now she was standing beyond any danger from the water at the exact spot which Trendellsohn had named. She stood still lest she might possibly miss him by moving, till she was again cold. But she did not regard that, though she pressed her cloak closely round her limbs. She did not move till she heard the first sound of the bell as it struck eight, and then she gave a little jump as she found that her lover was close upon her.|$|E
6000|$|He had, at last, {{found one}} person who could {{appreciate}} him. And in deliberate confidence he set to work to conquer her, and make her his own. It was a traitorous return, but a very natural one. And she, sweet creature! walked straight into the pleasant snare, utterly blind, because she fancied that she saw clearly. In the pride of her mysticism, she had fancied herself above so commonplace a passion as love. It was a curious feature of lower humanity, which she might investigate and analyse harmlessly as a cold scientific spectator; and, in her mingled pride and purity, she used to indulge Lancelot in metaphysical disquisitions about love and beauty, like that first one in their walk home from Minchampstead, from which a less celestially innocent soul would have shrunk. She thought, forsooth, as the old proverb says, that she could deal in honey, without putting her <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> But Lancelot knew better, and marked her for his own. And daily his self-confidence and sense of rightful power developed, and with them, paradoxical as it may seem, the bitterest self-abasement. The contact of her stainless innocence, the growing certainty that the destiny of that innocence was irrevocably bound up with his own, made him shrink from her whenever he remembered his own guilty career. To remember that there were passages in it which she must never know--that she would cast him from her with abhorrence if she once really understood their vileness? To think that, amid all the closest bonds of love, there must for ever be an awful, silent gulf in the past, of which they must never speak!--That she would bring to him what he could never, never bring to her!--The thought was unbearable. And as hideous recollections used to rise before him, devilish caricatures of his former self, mopping and mowing at him in his dreams, he would start from his lonely bed, and pace the room for hours, or saddle his horse, and ride all night long aimlessly through the awful woods, vainly trying to escape himself. How gladly, at those moments, he would have welcomed centuries of a material hell, {{to escape from the}} more awful spiritual hell within him,--to buy back that pearl of innocence which he had cast recklessly to be trampled under the feet of his own swinish passions! But, no; that which was done could never be undone,-- never, to all eternity. And more than once, as he wandered restlessly from one room to another, the barrels of his pistols seemed to glitter with a cold, devilish smile, and call to him,-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Two {{even smaller}} panels each depict a female figure with a halo on a plain golden background, with {{cypresses}} {{on either side}} of them, symbolising the Garden of Eden. According to their inscriptions they represent the Virtues of [...] "η αλιθηα" [...] (ἡ ἀλήθεια, Sincerity) and [...] "η ταινοσις" [...] (ἡ ταπείνωσις, Humility). Sincerity holds a cross in one <b>hand</b> and points <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> while Humility crosses her arms over her chest.|$|R
5000|$|One 1996 Media Graffiti titled Thank You Calvin, Thank You Kate {{garnered}} {{media attention}} {{at the time of}} its exhibition for Mace's playful [...] "manipulation."The title refers to fashion designer Calvin Klein and model Kate Moss.The target of the artist's embellishment, in this case, was a risqué magazine ad for Calvin Klein's Obsession perfume. The black and white ad showed a nude Kate Moss from her waist up with one <b>hand</b> raised <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> coyly and one bare breast visible.A pocket-sized figure added by Mace in pink ink clings to Kate's arm, fixated and reaching for her nipple — also subtly highlighted in pink — as a baby's pacifier falls from his mouth, agape.The image, as presupposed by the media, implies that Mace's figure prefers the real nipple over its plastic imitation, and the title implying the artist's gratitude for being provided such ripe source material.|$|R
6000|$|Then he {{was distracted}} from his pondering by tearful and joyful cries, and deeper voices of men. He {{looked up to}} {{recognize}} Blair's mother, father, sister; and men and women whose faces appeared familiar, but whose names he could not recall. His acute faculty of perception took quick note {{of a change in}} Blair's mother. Lane turned his gaze away. The agony of joy and sorrow--the light of her face--was more than Lane could stand. He looked at the sister Margaret--a tall, fair girl. She had paint on her cheeks. She did not see Lane. Her strained gaze held a beautiful and piercing intentness. Then her eyes opened wide, <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> went <b>to</b> cover <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and she cried out: [...] "Oh Blair!--poor boy! Brother!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In Late Gothic and Renaissance iconography, Invidia is personified {{invariably}} as a woman. Cesare Ripa's influential Iconologia (Rome, 1603) represented Invidia with {{a serpent}} coiled round her breast and biting her heart, [...] "to signify her self-devouring bitterness; she also raises one <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> to show she cares only for herself". The representational tradition drew on Latin authors such as Ovid, Horace, and Pliny, {{as well as}} Andrea Alciato's emblem book and Jacopo Sannazaro. Alciato portrayed her devouring her own heart in her anguish.|$|E

40|$|Imagine {{you see a}} woman biting into a sandwich, {{after which}} she grimaces and brings a <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> gagging. A similar {{expression}} is likely to appear on your face, and you may even start to feel a bit nauseated. In this thesis we show that such entwining of emotion perception and experience is evident {{at the level of}} the brain: seeing others’ emotional facial expressions involves some of the same regions as experiencing the emotions yourself. Mirroring or simulating motor aspects in the so-called mirror neuron system (MNS) plays an important role in this process. In contrast to what was previously thought, we show that abnormalities in the MNS cannot explain the whole constellation of clinical features associated with autism. We do find that adults with autism improve in mirroring as they age, which could be related to slight concurrent improvements in social functioning. In addition to autism, schizophrenia is characterised by social deficits. We show that, while the social profile of schizophrenia sometimes resembles that of autism when negative symptoms (such as flat affect) are more pronounced, differences in their underlying neural profiles are predominant. The inclusion of studies on both autism and schizophrenia in this thesis increases our knowledge of possible neurobiological mechanisms underlying social dysfunction in general, as well as of these disorders specifically. These insights could provide important new directions for the development of more effective therapies. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} investigate postures and manipulations of an infant with profound and multiple learning difficulties. The female subject, who is five years and five months old, is an infant with profound and multiple learning difficulties, suffering from hypotonus, atrophy {{of the brain and}} severe mental retardation. We made a hypothesis that postures and manipulations is mutually related and we also observed what behaviors appear in subject while the teaching materials were presented. Changing or unchanging her posture, she turned on the switch of the teaching material and ringed the chime by/with some parts of her body. While she changes her posture, there were behaviors that the switch was turned on by her mouth, chin and shoulder in sitting position on the chair. While she keeps her posture sitting up, we could see her behaviors; For example, (i) she reached the mirror in the supine position, (ii) she kicked the switch by her leg sitting on chair, (iii) she reached the switch putting her elbow on the desk, that is, she reached the switch after she carried her <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> In her position of sitting on the chair in front of the desk, she reached and slided the wooden knob along the board. At this moment, she controlled her posture moving her body forward and backward. Judging from the facts we mentioned above, our conclusion is that in an infant with profound and multiple learning difficulties the posture restricts the manipulation, otherwise the manipultion is performed in terms of changing the posture...|$|E
