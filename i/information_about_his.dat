5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usual practice elsewhere in the Historia ecclesiastica, Bede provides no <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> sources for the Cædmon story.

5|$|Not {{everything}} {{contained in}} the New Testament gospels {{is considered to be}} historically reliable. Views range from their being inerrant descriptions of the life of Jesus to their providing little historical <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> life beyond the basics. According to a broad scholarly consensus, the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), and not John, are the most reliable sources of information about Jesus.|$|E

5|$|In 1500, {{inspired}} by Palkuriki Somanatha (a bilingual poet in Kannada and Telugu), Singiraja synthesised an account {{on the life}} of Basavanna titled Maha Basavaraja Charitra (or Singiraja Purana), using the protagonist's vachana poems and giving details of his 88famous deeds, as well as <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> opponents in the court of Southern Kalachuri King BijjalaII. An eminent poet of this time was Guru Basava, known for his authorship of seven famous poems (Sapta Kavya), all but one being written in the shatpadi metre. He expounded on religious teachings in the form of formal discussions between the guru and disciple. His kavyas (classical epic poems) deal with spiritualism and extrasensory perception.|$|E

It is evident from Asser's account that he {{spent a good deal}} of time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred's mother-in-law, Eadburh (who is not the same Eadburh who died as a beggar in Pavia), on many occasions; and says that he has often seen Alfred hunting.|$|E

The survivors reunite at the Queen's chamber, and the commandos explain they have one hour before the Hive traps them inside automatically. Alice and Kaplan activate the Red Queen to find an exit. To force her cooperation, they rig a remote shutdown. As they escape through maintenance tunnels, zombies ambush them, and a reanimated J.D. bites Rain before getting killed. The group reaches safety, but Kaplan is bitten and separated.|$|E
5|$|Rejtan's {{dramatic}} {{attempt to}} prevent the partition earned him lasting recognition in Poland, one that began even during the proceedings, as he was lauded by some other deputies. His action was also praised as patriotic and respectable by the Prussian and Russian military commanders in Warsaw, who offered him a military escort {{to protect him from}} some confederates (particularly Poniński was holding a grudge against him). Soon, brochures and newspaper articles spread the <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> patriotic gesture throughout Poland and abroad. During the Great Sejm of 1788–92, a decree was passed, commending Rejtan, and deputies discussed a project to put a plaque to his name in the Sejm Chambers. His gesture in the Sejm was less famously repeated by Jan Suchorzewski during that period.|$|E

5|$|With Tychus {{acting as}} the middleman, the Raiders embark {{on a series of}} {{missions}} to find the remaining pieces of the Xel'Naga artifact, which they sell to the enigmatic Moebius Foundation in order to fund their revolution. Along the way, they meet with Gabriel Tosh, a rogue Dominion psychic assassin known as a Spectre, and Ariel Hanson, a researcher on the Zerg and leader of a small farming colony. The Raiders perform missions to help Tosh procure the raw materials to train new Spectres as well as to aid Hanson as she attempts to secure her colonists who are caught between the Zerg infesting their planets and the Protoss attempting to eradicate the infestation. Horner also arranges a series of missions to undermine Mengsk, recovering intelligence <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> war crimes and broadcasting them across the Dominion. Finally, Zeratul sneaks aboard the Hyperion to deliver a psychic crystal that allows Raynor to share visions involving an ominous prophecy where Zerg-Protoss hybrids and an enslaved Zerg swarm wipe out Humanity and the Protoss. The vision reveals that only Kerrigan has the power to prevent the eradication of all life in the sector and beyond.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ambush}} the two {{apparent}} shooters {{ran from the}} buildings and fled in a Ford sedan; the car was later discovered to have been set on fire and destroyed. Aiello's body was loaded into the taxicab and taken to Garfield Park Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The coroner eventually removed 59 bullets, weighing over a pound, from the body. He was shot more times than any single victim of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. A third machine gun position, which was ultimately not used, was later discovered by police in another nearby building, which had been rented {{a week before the}} murder by a man who gave the name Lon Celespe. Police, prosecutors and federal agents immediately and publicly speculated that Capone was behind the assassination, noting that the precision machine-gun ambush was typical of his attacks. However, at least one press story at the time speculated Moran could have been behind the hit. Prestogiacomo, fearful for his life, went into hiding for three days after Aiello's death before turning himself in to police. He was charged as an accessory before the fact of Aiello's murder, a charge also filed against John Sorce, an employee of Aiello's importing company. Detectives questioned whether Prestogiacomo provided Aiello's enemies with <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> whereabouts, something he vehemently denied. Police claimed Prestogiacomo was not cooperative and lied about his relationship with Aiello. The charges against Prestogiacomo went to a grand jury but were ultimately dropped. Frank Nitti was also wanted by police for questioning in connection with the murder.|$|E
