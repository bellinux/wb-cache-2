50|$|The <b>interest</b> <b>sensitivity</b> gap {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{techniques}} used in asset liability management to manage interest rate risk. The use of this technique was initiated in the middle 1970s in the United States when rising interest rates in 1975-1976 and again from 1979 onward triggered a banking crisis that later resulted in more than $1 trillion in losses when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation were forced to liquidate hundreds of failed institutions who had typically lent for long maturities at fixed interest rates (such as 30 year fixed rate mortgages) and borrowed for much shorter maturities. The interest rate sensitivity gap classifies all assets, liabilities and off balance sheet transactions by effective maturity from an interest rate reset perspective. A thirty-year fixed rate mortgage would be classified as a 30-year instrument. A 15-year mortgage with a rate fixed only for the first year would be classified as a one-year instrument. The interest rate sensitivity gap compares the amount of assets and liabilities in each time period in the interest rate sensitivity gap table. This comparison gives an approximate view of the interest rate risk of the balance sheet being analyzed. The interest rate sensitivity gap is much less accurate than modern interest rate risk management technology where the impact of a change in the yield curve can be analyzed using the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework based on the work of researchers such as John Hull, Alan White, Robert C. Merton, Robert A. Jarrow and many others.|$|E

The research purposes are {{to know about}} interest margin and <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity</b> on bank included LQ 45 category and to know which bank that has greatest interest margin and highest <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity.</b> Hypotesis used ini this research are interest margin and <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity</b> fluctuated. BRI Bank has greates interest margin and highest <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity.</b> Data analysis used in this research are Net Interest Margin (NIM) on percentage, gap ratio, and relative gap ratio. Net Interest Margin on percentage got from interest income minus interest cost and then divided by productive assets. Interest rate risk got from gap ratio each bank. Gap ratio calculated from Rate Sensitive Assets (RSA) divided by Rate Sensitive Liabilities (RSL). The next stage is calculate interest rate risk got from gap value divided by total assets and then subtracted one hundred percent. Test that used in this research is hypotesis test. This research shown result that NIM value and <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity</b> of bank’s LQ 45 category are fluctuated. BRI Bank has greatest average NIM value than other on year 2005 are 0. 0679, year 2006 are 0. 0611, and year 2007 are 0. 0591. This result shown BRI Bank has greatest profit than other banks.

40|$|The {{savings and}} loan crisis of the 1980 s {{revealed}} the vulnerability of some depository institutions to changes in interest rates. Since that episode, U. S. bank supervisors have placed more emphasis on monitoring the interest rate risk of commercial banks. Economists at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System developed a duration-based economic value model (EVM) designed to estimate the <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity</b> of banks. The authors test whether measures derived from the Fed’s EVM are correlated with the <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity</b> of U. S. community banks. The answer to this question is important because bank supervisors rely on EVM measures for monitoring and risk-scoping bank-level <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity.</b> The authors find that the Federal Reserve’s EVM is indeed correlated with banks’ <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity</b> and conclude that supervisors can rely on this tool to help assess a bank’s interest rate risk. These results are consistent with prior research that finds the average interest rate risk at banks to be modest, though the potential interaction between interest rate risk and other risk factors is not considered here.

We exploit this supply induced variation in interest rates to estimate the <b>interest</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of investment.

40|$|This study {{yields a}} {{contribution}} {{to a better understanding}} of the <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity</b> of real estate and should enable a more sophisticated interest rate risk management, especially for insurance companies and pension funds. This is achieved by modelling the whole life of a typical but simplified office investment property, based on a representative and exclusive data set for the Swiss investment real estate market. The interdependencies between interest rates, inflation, office market rents, current rent paid and expenses are modelled empirically. We perform Monte Carlo simulations that explicitly incorporate the uncertainty of the underlying stochastic processes, of their interdependencies and of modelling uncertainties, thus providing an indication of the final estimate’s uncertainty. Our results show that the <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity</b> of a typical office property is 13. 1 %, with a standard deviation of 7. 8 %.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity</b> of the US property/liability (P/L) insurers stock returns using various return generating process models incorporating different interest rate changes such as actual interest rate changes, unexpected interest rate changes and orthogonalized market returns. Design/methodology/approach – The study follows the 1974 two-index model by Stone. In the two-index model, three different interest rate indices are tested one at a time to examine if <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity</b> of the insurers stock returns, if any, is vulnerable to an interest rate index used. Findings – It is found that the US P/L insurers' stock returns are <b>sensitivity</b> to <b>interest</b> rate changes. The impact of actual interest rate changes on the stock returns is little different from that of unexpected interest rate changes, which is consistent with findings in the banking literature. When orthogonalized market returns are used in the models in lieu of actual market returns, the statistical significance on the estimated <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity</b> of the returns improves. Consistent with extant studies of financial institution's <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity,</b> the paper also reports that the <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity</b> of insurer stock returns is time varying. Research limitations/implications – Due to the data availability, the period studied is between 1992 and 2001. However, the sample period does not weaken the findings of the study. In addition, future research could incorporate the insurers' balance sheet items to investigate which balance sheet items (i. e. investment in bonds, stocks and other items on asset side and reserves and other items on liability side) explain most <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity.</b> Practical implications – Investors can adopt the findings of this study in creating or adjusting their portfolio with the US P/L insurers in it. The insurers stock returns are more sensitive to changes in long-term interest rate when the underwriting profit increases and the stock returns are more sensitive to changes in short-term interest rate when the underwriting profit decreases. Social implications – Although generalization is difficult and the conclusion is not as convincing as it could be because only one underwriting cycle is sampled, it is still noteworthy to recognize that the insurers' <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity</b> is closely related to the insurance industry's underwriting cycle or performance. Originality/value – This is the first study reporting the association between the <b>interest</b> rate <b>sensitivity</b> of the US stock returns and the underwriting performance.
