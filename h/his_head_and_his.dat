5|$|In Brussels, Rodin {{created his}} first {{full-scale}} work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure {{drew inspiration from}} Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally {{with his right hand}} atop <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.|$|E
500|$|With the {{lull in the}} fighting, and {{the onset}} of autumn rains, coupled with endless hills and {{deepening}} mud, Middleton's left knee, which had been uncomfortable {{for more than a}} year, was now becoming agonizing. He had hurt his right knee many years earlier playing football, but there was no immediate explanation for the pain in his left leg. Medics studied his leg, but had no answers. In late November Middleton went to the hospital in Naples, staying well into December, still without adequate diagnosis. He was able to hobble around, and did some staff work, then flew to General Eisenhower's headquarters in North Africa. He stayed there until mid-January, when he was sent to Walter Reed Hospital back in the United States. While Middleton was at Walter Reed, General Eisenhower communicated to General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, that he needed Middleton back overseas. Acknowledging Middleton's difficulty with his knees, Eisenhower said, [...] "I don't give a damn about his knees; I want <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> heart. And I'll take him into battle on a litter if we have to." [...] Command of the 45th Division went to Major General William W. Eagles.|$|E

"'Humfray Adderton, who at {{the trial}} of Wenlock Christison, did, as it were, bid {{defiance}} to Heaven, by saying to Wenlock, 'You pronounce Woes and Judgements, {{and those that are}} gone before you pronounced Woes and Judgements; but the Judgements of the Lord God are not upon us yet,' was suddenly surprised: having been, on a certain day, exercising his men with much pomp and ostentation, he was returning home in the evening, near the place where they usually loosed the Quakers from the cart, after they had whipped them, his horse, suddenly affrighted, threw him with such violence, that he instantly died; his eyes being dashed out of <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> brains coming out of his nose, his tongue hanging out at his mouth, and the blood running out at his ears: Being taken up and brought into the Courthouse, the place where he had been active in sentencing the innocent to death, his blood ran through the floor, exhibiting to the spectators a shocking instance of the Divine vengeance against a daring and hardened persecutor; that made a fearful example of that divine judgment, which, when forewarned of, he had openly despised, and treated with disdain.'

500|$|The Love-matic Grampa is a sitcom-style {{television}} series about Moe's love life. He receives {{advice from the}} ghost of Abraham Simpson, who was crushed by a store shelf containing cans of figs that toppled on him and subsequently [...] "while travelling up toward Heaven...got lost along the way" [...] and now possesses Moe's love tester machine. Moe ends up getting a date he meets at the bar. On Grampa's advice he takes his date out to a French restaurant and hides the Love Tester in the bathroom {{so he can get}} advice while at the restaurant. After Kearney, Dolph and Jimbo whack the machine because it said they were gay, it malfunctions and advises Moe to tell his date that [...] "her rump's as big as the Queen's, and twice as fragrant." [...] Moe returns with a bowl of snails dumped on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> dependence on the machine is revealed, so he confesses to receiving advice. His date is actually happy when she hears this, flattered that Moe would go to all that trouble for her. Grampa asks to be introduced to an attractive payphone in front of the restaurant, much to the mirth of Moe and his date.|$|E
2500|$|The Book of Revelation {{includes}} John's {{vision of}} the Son of Man: [...] "...and His feet were like unto burnt brass, <b>His</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>His</b> hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;" [...] , as if they burned in a furnace..." [...] in a vision (...) , but this vision is usually considered to refer to Jesus in heavenly form, not necessarily his appearance during his earthly life.|$|E
2500|$|One day {{he asked}} me to do his portrait. I agreed with joy, all the more so because <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> whole {{personality}} [...] {{seemed to me to be}} perfect models for emphasising the plastic elements I was trying to develop. His face with clearly demarcated surfaces that made up a passionate interplay of facets, his hair in dark masses projecting lightly in waves over his temples, his solidly constructed body - straightaway suggested to me equivalences, echoes , interpenetrations, rhythmic correspondences with the surrounding elements, fields, trees, houses. So I suggested painting him in my garden, where I found easily to hand an environment that was highly suitable for my model.|$|E

2500|$|Billy Strayhorn, {{originally}} {{hired as}} a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939. Nicknamed [...] "Swee' Pea" [...] for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly {{of the man and}} their collaborative working relationship, [...] "my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes {{in the back of my}} head, my brain waves in <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> in mine". Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music, but also arranged and polished many of Ellington's works, becoming a second Ellington or [...] "Duke's doppelganger". It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio. The 1930s ended with a very successful European tour just as World War II loomed in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1959, Sheriff Batton joined Otis F. [...] "Bill" [...] Minter, Sr. (1902-1960), his {{successor}} as police chief, and Dr. Thomas A. Richardson (1911-1976), the Webster Parish coroner, {{in the investigation}} of the mysterious death of Minden railroad engineer Marcelous Douglas Cheshire (1906-1959), who was found with a blow to <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wallet missing on January 4 {{in the parking lot of}} a local grocery store. He died three days later in a Shreveport hospital. Cheshire and his wife, later Ruth Cheshire Lowe (1906-1991), owned the Joy and the Joy Drive-In theaters in Minden, both long since closed. The investigation first focused on Duke E. Schultz (1929-1999), a then 30-year-old gasoline station attendant with a history of arrests, a suicide attempt, and mental instability. Batton said that he believed Cheshire was struck by a rubber hammer used in service station work. Nevertheless, after more than a half-century, the Cheshire death remains unsolved.|$|E
