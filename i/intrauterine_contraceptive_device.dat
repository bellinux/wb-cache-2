5000|$|Roman Catholic medical {{facilities}} refuse treatment which {{runs counter to}} their beliefs. Contraception among other treatments is not provided, complications due to existing contraception may not be treated. Users may be unaware of these restrictions, even unaware that their health provider is connected with the Roman Catholic Church till something goes wrong. For example a woman bleeding and in pain due to a misplaced <b>Intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> was refused treatment. We think {{that people should be}} aware that they may face limitations on the kind of care they can receive when they go to the doctor based on religious restrictions. It’s really important that the public understand that this is going on and it is going on in a widespread fashion so that people can take whatever steps they need to do to protect themselves.

50|$|Cusco's self {{retaining}} bivalved speculum is {{a surgical}} instrument used for vaginal and cervical examination. It has a jaw which opens {{up like a}} duck bill. It comes in three models : side scew, centre screw and in special narrow virgin size. The Cusco's speculum is usually 80mm long and 22 mm broad. However, smaller and larger sizes are available. Cusco's speculum is used for introducing an <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device,</b> taking a Pap smear, cauterization of vaginal erosion and for colposcopic examination. It is preferred in cryosurgery because it protects the anterior and posterior vaginal wall. The advantage of Cusco's speculum {{is that it is}} self-retaining. Therefore, an assistant's help is not needed to keep the speculum in place. It also acts as the vaginal wall retractor. However, it reduces the space in the vaginal cavity and therefore is not a preferred instrument for vaginal surgery. Since it covers most of the vaginal wall, small lesions on the vaginal wall may be masked by the blades of the device.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> is {{the most}} common method of {{reversible}} contraception in women. The <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> can perforate the uterus and can also migrate into pelvic or abdominal organs. Perforation of the urinary bladder by an <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> is not common. In West Africa, intravesi‑ cal migration of an <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> has been rarely reported. In this report, we present a case of an <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> migration into the urinary bladder of a 33 year old African woman at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana. Case report: A 33 year old African woman presented with persistent urinary tract infection of 7 months duration despite appropriate antibiotic treatments. An abdominal ultrasonography revealed a urinary bladder calculus which was found to be an <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> on removal at cystoscopy. She got pregnant whilst having the <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> in place and delivered at term. Conclusion: The presence of recurrent or persistent urinary tract infection in any woman with an intrauterine contra‑ ceptive device should raise the suspicion of intravesical migration of the <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device...</b>|$|E

40|$|Intrauterine {{contraceptive}} {{devices are}} being used in clinical practice since 1962. Due to their efficiency and low cost, intrauterine contraceptive devices {{are the most popular}} method of reversible contraception in developing countries. The incidence of migration of an <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device,</b> and related uterine perforation ranges from 0. 003 % to 0. 87 %. <b>Intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> may migrate into urinary bladder, appendix, rectum, colon, peritoneum, anterior abdominal wall or ovary.

40|$|Background: Use {{of modern}} {{contraceptive}} methods {{has been shown}} to reduce unwanted pregnancy, high parity and maternal mortality. Intrauterine contraceptive devices which are among the safest and most effective reversible contraceptives available, are particularly suitable for women in developing countries as they are affordable, convenient to use, do not require re-supply visits and are very cost-effective. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the socio-demographic characteristics of <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> acceptors, the pattern of insertions and complications at the University of Uyo Teaching hospital, Uyo. Method: The record cards of all clients who had <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> inserted at the family planning clinic over a six-year period were reviewed. Results: During the study period, there were 852 new contraceptive acceptors out of which 39. 7 &#x 0025; accepted the <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device.</b> The modal age group of the clients was 25 - 29 years (32. 5 &#x 0025;). Acceptance of <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> was most common among multiparous clients (65. 1 &#x 0025;). Majority of the acceptors were married (90. 0 &#x 0025;), Christians (98. 8 &#x 0025;) and 72. 8 &#x 0025; had at least secondary school education. Clinic personnel (65. 7 &#x 0025;) and friends/relatives (21. 3 &#x 0025;) were the most common sources of information on contraception. Most (93. 5 &#x 0025;) of the clients had their intrauterine contraceptive devices inserted within 7 days of menstruation. Lower abdominal pain (5. 5 &#x 0025;) and vulval/vaginal itching (5. 3 &#x 0025;) were the most common complications. Conclusion: The acceptors of intrauterine contraceptive devices in our center were young, multiparous and educated women. Increasing mass media involvement in the dissemination of accurate information about intrauterine contraceptive devices to the general populace, the introduction of postpartum and post-abortal <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> insertions and the encouragement of our grandmultiparous women to accept <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> would lead to an increase in its acceptance and use...|$|E

The results suggest that plastic <b>intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>devices</b> predispose to colonisation by actinomyces-like organisms, particularly after long-term use.

40|$|Infection with genital {{herpes simplex}} virus (HSV) remains a common viral sexually {{transmitted}} disease, often subclinical and a major worldwide problem of women of reproductive age group. Herpes cervicitis is an unusual presentation of Herpes simplex virus infection in females. The finding of herpes cervicitis on routine pap smear of an asymptomatic woman on <b>Intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> still further supports the need for increased awareness {{on the possibility of}} Herpes simplex virus infection among women, particularly those on <b>Intrauterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device.</b> The index case is a 28 years old Nigerian female who was referred to our Special Treatment Clinic on account of an abnormal pap smear cytology which was in keeping with Herpes cervicitis.
