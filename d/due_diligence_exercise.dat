40|$|AbstractSignificant {{reductions}} in CO 2 emissions to atmosphere from established industrial {{processes such as}} power generation and also cement, {{iron and steel production}} require increased, widespread deployment of commercial-scale CCS projects. Large-scale integrated projects (LSIPs) face different challenges than do smaller pilot and demonstration projects that have contributed much toward technical research. LSIPs have a much larger spatial scale of operation and a much larger temporal scale as they are expected to be operational for many decades and will require on-going monitoring, performance assessments, and must satisfy regulated reporting requirements. Among the most significant factors required to move an LSIP forward is the need to provide confidence internally to the project proponents that the technical appraisal of the project and the prospective business case can justify a final investment decision (FID) of tens to {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} or more. Many non-geological factors also have major influence over CCS project success such as regulatory environment continued uncertainty around national and international policy development around greenhouse gas mitigation, and uncertain public support. Considering the large commitment in financial and technical resources required to reach FID, perhaps neither the slow progress in LSIP development nor the highly visible project cancellations and postponements in this nascent industry should be unexpected. Although all project proponents are confronted with unique geological and non-technical issues there are common aspects that may be recognized within projects achieving FID that may be broadly instructive. Storage exploration and site appraisal is a lengthy process that will take years and should not be underestimated. Industrial scale CCS requires a firm and large commitment and investment in human, technical, and financial resources. Recent LSIPs that have achieved FID have employed dedicated full-time subsurface teams for years to reduce uncertainties in the storage plan. Multi-faceted projects such as large-scale CCS require decisions be made even though uncertainties exist at various stages of project lifecycle. There is a critical need to manage these uncertainties in all aspects of the project, particularly when dealing with changes in project scope or framework in order to reach milestones and decision gates. Projects may not always proceed linearly through lifecycles and may need to recycle back to an earlier development phase if appropriate. Interface management around project integration is a critical process that must be actively managed to consider exploration and appraisal requirements. For example, capture requirements feed into storage requirements, and storage limitations may impact capture considerations and project feasibility. Focused stakeholder engagement is required: projects must provide transparency to the community and the regulator; public reviews and technical <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>exercises</b> such as independent peer reviews bring confidence to the government; environmental assessments bring confidence to the community all of the above build confidence in the project...|$|R

40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&A) {{have become an}} important strategy for international expansion, even though numerous acquisitions fail to achieve their financial and strategic objectives. The risk associated with transactions partly depends {{on the extent to}} which the insight into the target company actually holds true. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is performed to eliminate this information asymmetry. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is an audit conducted prior to the planned transaction. It can be described as a purposeful and systematic investigation of business opportunity and risk during on-going sale negotiations. The importance of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is emphasized widely in the academic literature as well as among M&A practitioners. On the other hand, researches and practitioners have differing views on what and how much is enough for a <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> audit. Therefore, this study examines the role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> in a cross-border acquisition process. The main objective of the research is fulfilled by examining the reasons for conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence,</b> recognizing the elements affecting effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and analyzing the need and opportunities for enhancing the utilization of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> For the empirical part of this qualitative study five expert interviews were conducted among experienced Finnish acquirers and advisors. In addition, five expert interviews conducted for a distinct study were utilized as a secondary source of data. The results of this study present fundamental reasons for conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> However, conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is not always self-evident. Doubtful attitude towards <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> exists, though it is exceptional. Carefully planning the focus of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and compiling and managing the team conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> are identified as the main elements affecting effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> Altogether, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> can have plural roles which in this study are categorized as the confirmatory, preparative, and cross-functional roles of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> The older academic literature tends to emphasize the confirmatory role whereas the current academic discussion also supports the preparative role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> It can be argued that the roles of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> differ among experienced <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practitioners based on several factors. In attempt to increase the value of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> for acquirers, more than one role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is likely to exist.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of traditional <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practices {{and whether they}} contribute to Merger and Acquisition (M&A) success or failure is an ongoing debate in finance research. This research report contributes to the debate by examining the {{effectiveness of}} traditional <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> using a qualitative research approach. A dataset of traditional <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practices was compiled from the literature, which {{formed the basis for}} an interview which was conducted with corporate finance practices. The findings indicate that the traditional <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process is considered to be an evolving process, where <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practices of the last decade are considered to be significantly different from the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> required in acquisitions today. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is also considered to be indispensable, and its scope and importance underestimated. Furthermore, any perceived deficiency in a <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is not necessarily in concept, but rather in execution, with excessive focus on the accounting and legal aspects of a M&A, while neglecting the macro-environment, marketing, production, management and information systems. It is also concluded that most stakeholders have understood that failure to carry out proper <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> could be financially damaging to the parties transacting. In an attempt to determine what <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> means for the current as well as the future, this study uncovers a critical trend in the forms and manner of flawed <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practices and paves the way to a more strategic <b>due</b> <b>diligence,</b> which are useful for practitioners in the present and in the future for M&A success...|$|R

40|$|Product {{planning}} helps {{a company}} to strategically plan its current and future product platforms and offer product variants in the marketplace. Product platforming is widely touted as a successful strategy for mass cus-tomization. However, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> should be <b>exercised</b> before implement-ing any product platform strategy. The product planning exercise should account for future uncertainties. Traditional financial tools such as the net present value (NPV) are static since they do not compensate for any exoge-nous and endogenous uncertainties {{during the course of}} the project. The crux of the problem lies in the evaluation model that is used for evaluating the product planning projects. While many view uncertainties in a product planning project as problematic, it can also be viewed as a source of new opportunities. We argue that uncertainties should be an integral part of the evaluation model. If the future possibilities (or strategic options) are not considered in the evaluation model, a corporation may face a “myopic syndrome. ” In this article, we consider two important product planning decisions— platform decisions and product variant decisions. The platform decision involves strategic selection of a concept product platform from various pos-sible alternative concept product platforms. The product variant decision involves deciding how long a company should continue to offer its cur-rent product variant in the marketplace and whether the existing produc...|$|R

40|$|Cambridge University Press 2013. In {{the context}} of {{corporate}} accountability, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and complicity are two important concepts. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> as ‘the care that a reasonable person exercises to avoid harm to other persons or their property’. In the business context, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> refers to the ‘research and analysis of a company or organization done {{in preparation for a}} business transaction’, or the ‘duty of a firm’s directors and officers to act prudently in evaluating associated risks in all transactions’. Complicity, on the other hand, is described as ‘association or participation in… a wrongful act’. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> and complicity are thus different notions. This chapter will explore the various possible connections between these two concepts. Questions arising in this respect include, for example, whether the assessment and avoidance of the risk of complicity is part of a company’s <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> responsibility. If so, can complicity liability arise even though the company acted with <b>due</b> <b>diligence,</b> but harm nevertheless occurs? And can <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> responsibilities help to define the elements of complicity liability, with regard to both the question of which acts might result in liability of the company for third party wrongdoing, and which mental element is necessary in order to hold the corporation to account in such circumstances?

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M & A) {{are a big}} part of the corporate finance world. Everyday investment bankers arrange M & A transactions, which bring separate companies together to form larger ones. The key principle behind buying a company is to create shareholder value over and above that of the sum of the two companies. Two companies together are more valuable than two separate companies; at least that's the reasoning behind M & A. Before an M & A transaction, companies usually require some kind of evaluation of the company that is to be acquired. This evaluation is then used to determine whether the transaction should take place, and what the target price should be for the acquiring company. The most commonly known method used to do such an evaluation is known as a <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> The <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process can be a long drawn out process, which can be extremely disruptive to an organisation. <b>Due</b> <b>diligences</b> can take several months to complete in a complex organization. The issue surrounding the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process is that it is not a standardized procedure and each organization or specialist carries out the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process differently, when considering a merger and acquisition. The problem is that there is no one structure, format or model which can make the necessary information available to the decision-makers of the acquiring company without going through the complete <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process. If a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model was available, which could give pertinent information to decision-makers, huge <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> costs could be saved. Therefore the main study objective of this dissertation is to determine the value of a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> before an M & A, and whether a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model would be beneficial to decision-makers of manufacturing companies. The study will lead to the development of a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model that can be used by South African manufacturing organisations for M & A. A combination of the theoretical techniques, literature review data and the empirical study data will be used to determine what should be included in a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model, which can be used by decision-makers to determine whether or not to pursue the merger and acquisition.
