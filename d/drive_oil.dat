50|$|Fire {{flooding}} {{works best}} when the oil saturation and porosity are high. Combustion generates the heat within the reservoir itself. Continuous injection of air or other gas mixture with high oxygen content will maintain the flame front. As the fire burns, it {{moves through the}} reservoir toward production wells. Heat from the fire reduces oil viscosity and helps vaporize reservoir water to steam. The steam, hot water, combustion gas and a bank of distilled solvent all act to <b>drive</b> <b>oil</b> {{in front of the}} fire toward production wells.|$|E
50|$|Algeria's first {{president}} was the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN) leader Ahmed Ben Bella. Morocco's claim to portions of western Algeria {{led to the}} Sand War in 1963. Ben Bella was overthrown in 1965 by Houari Boumediene, his former ally and defence minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian; Boumédienne continued this trend. But, he relied {{much more on the}} army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialization <b>drive.</b> <b>Oil</b> extraction facilities were nationalised.

50|$|The key {{to winning}} the war on terror, therefore, {{is to create a}} {{substitute}} for oil. Zubrin argues that a mandate that all new cars sold in the United States be flex-fueled (FFV, for Flex-Fuel Vehicle, able to run on gasoline, ethanol or methanol, or any combination thereof) would very quickly make such vehicles the world standard, as occurred in the early 1980s with the introduction of catalytic converters. As a result, consumers would demand ethanol- and methanol-blended fuels due to their price competitiveness with gasoline, which would in turn prompt gas stations to instal biofuel pumps. Under such a situation, competition would <b>drive</b> <b>oil</b> prices down. Zubrin argues that biofuels should be subsidized in order to keep their price advantage over gasoline, as {{it is the only way}} to cripple OPEC.|$|E
50|$|With {{the slogan}} “The challenger“, the HATZ 1B-series was {{presented}} in 1996, showing a number of technical highlights. In a minimum of space, all the important functional components of the engine such as decompression device, injection pump <b>drive,</b> <b>oil</b> pump with oil pump pressure regulator, valve train system for inlet and outlet valve, governor, speed control lever with governor spring and the multi-functional mechanical control system are integrated in the governor housing. Due to these technical features, the B-series scores with a light-weight and compact design.Depending on their cylinder capacity, the air-cooled one-cylinder diesel engines of B-series are available at power ranges from 1.5 to 7.6 kW and a maximum speed of 3600 rpm. Furthermore, models with vertical or horizontal crankshaft are available. The B-series complies with the strict requirements of EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) Tier IV final in the US.|$|E

30|$|The Schoonebeek {{oil field}} is {{situated}} {{in the eastern part}} of the Netherlands at the German border. The oil is produced from the Bentheim barrier sands of Neocom/Valanginian age. A completely sealing fault divides the accumulation into two separate reservoirs. The southwestern part produces by solution-gas drive and the remainder of the field by edge-water drive. In the greater part of the field, the reservoir consists of a single, unconsolidated sand body. Schoonebeek pilot project is an inverted five-spot pattern.

Our findings are that oil price shocks driven by oil supply positively affect net oil-consumer countries faster than net oil-producer countries. Oil price shocks driven by aggregate demand are largely country-specific. Oil shocks driven by other demands influence net oil-producers faster than net oil-consumers negatively, and persistently mostly among net oil-producers.

40|$|AbstractThe {{fundamental}} {{theory of}} the Hydro-viscous Drive(HVD) and the structure principle of HVD set were reviewed. Through theoretical analyses on working performance of the HVD set, the point was made that {{the properties of the}} lubricant oil is among the most crucial factors that determines the performances of HVD sets. So the ideal properties that a good lubricating oil for HVD systems should have were discussed, such as viscosity and viscosity index. The characteristics of major types of lubricating oils are also described. Through extentive experiments, the performances of different lubricating oils when they used with HVD systems were compared. The experiment results lead us to recommend one specific type of lubricant oil, the No. 6 hydrodynamic <b>drive</b> <b>oil,</b> be used with HVD systems due to its superior properties...|$|E

Real options methodology is applied in analyzing the impact of oil price volatility on strategic investment of oil companies in the three regions. The empirical {{results show that the}} regional differences do exist, where the relationship between oil price volatility and oil companies' strategic investment in North America shows a reverse U shaped curve; meanwhile in Asia is exhibits a U shaped curve; while that in Europe shows a positive correlated linear relationship. These different regional results of oil price uncertainty could provide companies and governments essential information to make investment and policy decisions based on the according regions...|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of the forces that <b>drive</b> <b>oil</b> stock prices is extremely important given {{the size of the}} Oil &Gas industry and its links with the energy sector and the environment.

In this paper we focus on the long-run financial determinants of the stock prices of six major oil companies (Bp, Chevron-Texaco, Eni, Exxon-Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total-Fina-Elf) using multivariate cointegration techniques and vector error correction models. Weekly oil stock prices are analyzed together with the relevant stock market indexes, exchange rates, spot and future oil prices over the period January 1998 April 2003. The empirical results confirm the statistical significance of the major financial variables in explaining the long-run dynamics of oil companies stock values...|$|E

Here we report the genome sequence of Oleispira antarctica and show that compared with Alcanivorax borkumensis-the paradigm of mesophilic hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria-O. antarctica has a larger genome that has witnessed massive gene-transfer events. We identify an array of alkane monooxygenases, osmoprotectants, siderophores and micronutrient-scavenging pathways. We also show that at low temperatures, the main protein-folding machine Cpn 60 functions as a single heptameric barrel that uses larger proteins as substrates compared with the classical double-barrel structure observed at higher temperatures. With 11 protein crystal structures, we further report the largest set of structures from one psychrotolerant organism. The most common structural feature is an increased content of surface-exposed negatively charged residues compared to their mesophilic counterparts. Our findings are relevant {{in the context of}} microbial cold-adaptation mechanisms and the development of strategies for oil-spill mitigation in cold environments...|$|E
