2500|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is {{the biological}} treatment of liquid animal waste using bacteria {{in an area}} absent of air, which promotes the decomposition of organic solids. [...] Hot water is used to heat the waste {{in order to increase}} the rate of biogas production (Cornell University Manure Waste Management). The remaining liquid is nutrient rich and can be used on fields as a fertilizer and methane gas that can be burned directly on the biogas stove or in an <b>engine</b> <b>generator</b> to produce electricity and heat. Methane is about 20 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, which has significant negative environmental effects if not controlled properly. [...] Anaerobic treatment of waste is the best method for controlling the odor associated with manure management.|$|E

2500|$|By 1904 {{the area}} was {{recognised}} {{as a source of}} gravel and pits were established by 1907, especially on the east bank, and continue to produce aggregates and take in clean fill. Other landfilling ended in 2006, when a 1999 consent for a Hamilton City Council landfill expired. It had been started in October 1985 on a [...] sand pit (worked from about 1970 to 2000) and was replaced by Hampton Downs. It was closed earlier than originally planned, due to leachate problems. The 1999 consent required use of a vacuum to extract gas from the bores and leachate.

2500|$|Diesel <b>engine</b> <b>generator</b> {{sets are}} often used for prime power in {{communities}} not connected to a widespread power grid. [...] Emergency (standby) power systems may use reciprocating internal combustion engines operated by fuel oil or natural gas. [...] Standby generators may serve as emergency power for a factory or data center, or may also be operated in parallel with the local utility system to reduce peak power demand charge from the utility. [...] Diesel engines can produce strong torque at relatively low rotational speeds, which is generally desirable when driving an alternator, but diesel fuel in long-term storage can be subject to problems resulting from water accumulation and chemical decomposition. [...] Rarely used generator sets may correspondingly be installed as natural gas or LPG to minimize the fuel system maintenance requirements.|$|E

[...] After serving on the Portland-Seattle run it was retired in June 1939, as the imperative to increase the power of the City of Denver trains drove Union Pacific to cannibalize M-10001 and M-10004. [...] By December the diesel <b>engine,</b> <b>generator,</b> trucks, and the steam generator from the RPO/baggage car were removed and installed in a new carbody to become the third power unit on the CD-07 set for the City of Denver.
