25|$|On 24 September 2009 Delhi Lieutenant Governor granted Sharma 30-day parole from jail, on {{the grounds}} that he needed to attend to his ailing mother, attend the last rites of his {{grandmother}} and also look after the family business which was suffering in his absence. But, the basis for the parole was proved unfounded as Sharma's grandmother had already died in 2008. During the second extension of the parole for another 30 days, Sharma was seen partying in a discothèque in Delhi. His mother, whose illness was also the basis for the parole, was seen at a media briefing promoting a ladies cricket tournament at his <b>family-run</b> <b>hotel</b> in Chandigarh. It was also later revealed that the parole was granted despite an objection from the Delhi police.|$|E

5000|$|For years, Negril's beach {{has been}} rated {{as one of}} the top ten beaches in the world by many travel magazines. The beach's length is the stuff of legends—it is {{actually}} little more than four miles in length, but tourists and travel writers insist on the [...] "seven-mile" [...] label. The north end of the beach is home to the large, all-inclusive resorts, and to the south are the smaller, <b>family-run</b> <b>hotels.</b> This combination gives the Negril area a large variety of rooms, services and prices.|$|R

40|$|The study {{explored}} work-family balance among Irish hotel employees. Employees of a 5 *, 4 * and 3 * hotels {{were surveyed}} in a unionised hotel group, a non-unionised hotel group and two <b>family-run</b> <b>hotels,</b> including a 4 * and a 3 *. Two thirds {{of those surveyed}} were front-line employees {{and a total of}} 246 (22 %) returned questionnaires were used for data analysis. Regarding work-family supports, there was a considerable range varying from hotels with no supports, hotels with one support and hotels with all eight supports available. Company benefits were not associated with numerical flexibility, but company benefits were associated with functional flexibility and work-life balance supports. This would suggest an integrated approach to human resource management (HRM), whereby some companies engage in a modern employee-focused approach, whereas other companies tend to be more traditional. The study enhances the literature on the link between HRM practices and work-family balance in the hotel sector...|$|R

50|$|The Henking Hotel and Cafe was a {{historic}} building at 15-21 Lyman Street in Springfield, Massachusetts. The four story hotel brick and stone building {{was built in}} 1880 for Gustave and Elizabeth Gruendler, German immigrants who had operated hotels elsewhere {{in the city for}} some time. Upon their death the building was taken over by Henry Henking, who had worked for the Gruendlers. He changed the name of the hotel and remodeled its facade in a Georgian Revival style. His son Gus took over the business upon his death in 1906, and further expanded the business, building a banquet space adjacent. The hotel was strategically located opposite an entrance to the railroad station, and the business of the small <b>family-run</b> <b>hotel</b> was good despite competition from larger hotels nearby.|$|E
50|$|The {{house was}} left to various people until William Shanahan and his wife Angela bought it in 1970. The house {{was in a state}} of semi deriliction at this stage. Oriel House (the name having been changed from Oriel Court) was officially opened as a hotel in 1983 and was a <b>family-run</b> <b>hotel.</b> The house {{retained}} its old world charm whilst owned by the Shanahan family. They had the vision to use salvaged items (before doing so became a pastiche)to create the atmosphere which was unique, rather than out of a catalogue, like many other manufactured bars and hotels. The front door to the cellar bar, for instance, came from Cork City Goal in Sundays Well. The doors to the hotel were from the Savoy Cinema in the city, as was some of the seating used in the cellar area at one time. The counter in the lounge of the hotel area came from a bank in the city centre, as did the one in the small bar in the cellar area. Some of the tables came from Saint Augustins Church. One of the stools was made from a toilet seat. The copper cowls on the fireplaces were from recycled copper cylinders created by a local traditional travelling craftsman. The bedrooms were individually decorated with antique furniture such as beds from Kilkenny Castle, rather than the one style for all rooms used in the current hotel.|$|E
40|$|Just {{a couple}} of months ago I was on {{vacation}} in southern Italy. My wife and I were staying on the little volcanic island of Ischia just off the coast from Naples. We were staying in a quaint little <b>family-run</b> <b>hotel</b> right on the beach. It was a gorgeous sunny October day with bright blue skies. We spent the day swimming in the crisp clear blue ocean in front of our hotel and walking over the hillsides in the olive groves enjoying countryside. It was a near perfect day. Now was the best part of the day – dinner. We were to have dinner at the restaurant run by the same family that operated our small hotel. We were ravenously hungry after our day’s activities and ready for the perfect Mediterranean meal. The family was at the restaurant to greet us with smiles and hugs and warm Italian charm. Our small table wa...|$|E
