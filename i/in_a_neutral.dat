5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is an {{oxidizing}} agent. Depending on the reaction, {{this may}} be due to the Pb2+(aq) ion, which has a standard reduction potential (E0) of −0.125V, or the nitrate ion, which under acidic conditions has an E0 of +0.956V.

5|$|As Northern Ireland's most {{dominant}} club side, Linfield have been regular campaigners in European football. The club first participated in European competition in 1959 against Göteborg in the 1959–60 European Cup. In {{the first round}} of the 1961–62 European Cup, Linfield were drawn to face an East German team, Vorwärts. The away leg was played, which Linfield lost 3–0. However, Vorwärts were denied visas for entry into the UK to play the second leg, and (similarly to Glenavon the previous season) travelling to play the game <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> country was not financially viable for Linfield. They were therefore forced to withdraw from the competition.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Germany {{simply had}} no battleships. The Armistice with Germany {{required}} {{that most of}} the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in Scapa Flow, Scotland. The Treaty of Versailles specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were scuttled by their German crews on June 21, 1919 just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any capital ships.|$|E

5|$|After {{a two-year}} {{absence from the}} Copa Libertadores, Atlético {{qualified}} for the 1981 edition as runner-up of the 1980 Campeonato Brasileiro, which it had lost to Flamengo. The refereeing in the finals had been controversial, as Atlético forward Reinaldo was sent off with a straight red card after scoring a brace. Brazil's representatives were once again drawn into Group 3, together with Olimpia and Cerro Porteño, whom Atlético faced {{for a second time}} in a group stage of the Libertadores. The two encounters between the Brazilian clubs ended 22, and both won two and drew two matches against the Paraguayans, meaning Atlético and Flamengo were tied on points. According to the competition's rules, a one-game playoff <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> stadium had to be played between the clubs to decide which one would advance to the semifinals.|$|E
5|$|Rovers won {{once again}} in an away game against Upton Park at West Ham Park by a {{scoreline}} of 3–0 in the fifth round. The match was more competitive than the scoreline might suggest, as Blackburn were a goal down at half time but won the game after a goal by John Inglis and two by Joe Lofthouse in the second half. At Birmingham <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> venue, they defeated Notts County in the semi-final 1–0. As with Olympic against Queen's Park, Notts also complained of events that took place during their semi-final. They argued that Rovers had illegally fielded Inglis, a player from Glasgow who had played for Rangers and was only drafted it to the Blackburn team to improve their cup performance. A letter was produced by Rovers {{to show that he}} had been expelled from Rangers because he continued to play for the English team instead. Notts wanted the match to be replayed without Inglis, but the FA did not uphold the complaint.|$|E
5|$|Such trusts will be invalid {{in several}} circumstances; {{charitable}} trusts {{are not allowed}} to be run for profit, nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the charitable purpose). In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> manner is acceptable. Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is no relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries. This results in two things; firstly, the trustees of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against the trustees. Rather, the beneficiaries are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.|$|E

5|$|The three {{ships were}} the Italian 8,500-ton {{merchant}} vessel Duchessa d'Aosta, the second a large German tug Likomba, the third a diesel-powered barge Bibundi. Duchessa d'Aosta had a working radio which {{was considered a}} threat, {{with the potential to}} provide details of Allied naval movements. Her declared cargo was 3 million pounds of wool, 316,610 pounds of hides and skins, 1.3 million pounds of tanning materials, 4 million pounds of copra, 544,660 pounds of crude asbestos fibre and over 1.1 million ingots of electrolytic copper. The first page of the ship's cargo manifest, was not presented to the port authorities and the ship's captain refused to provide them with any details, which led to speculation it was also carrying arms or ammunition. In his visits to the island, SOE agent Leonard Guise kept the ships under observation, and in August 1941 submitted a plan to seize Likomba and disable Duchessa d'Aosta. Approval for the military operation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> port was given by the Admiralty on 20 November 1941.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neutral</b> position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E

Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, {{will affect the}} Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma moments, the Karma moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good Karma.|$|E
