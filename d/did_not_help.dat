5|$|Atrocities {{continued}} {{during the}} German retreat from Southern France as German soldiers plundered and burned down towns. French civilians were brought before ad-hoc military courts {{and sentenced to}} death because of alleged partisan activities. These atrocities <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> to subdue the French uprising. Instead, the German reprisals had the opposite effect and encouraged the French population to engage in partisan fighting.|$|E
5|$|The British {{educational}} policies segregating {{the different}} races — providing minimal public education for Malays, and leaving non-Malays {{to their own}} devices — <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> matters. The Malays, predominantly rural-dwellers, were not encouraged to socialise with the more urban non-Malays. The economic impoverishment of the Malays which set them apart from the better-off Chinese also fanned racial sentiments.|$|E

5|$|Champollion, {{a liberal}} and {{progressive}} minded man, {{lived in a}} period of political turmoil in France which continuously threatened to disrupt his research in various ways. During the Napoleonic wars he was able to avoid conscription, but his Napoleonic allegiances meant that he was considered suspect by the subsequent Royalist regime. His own actions, sometimes brash and reckless, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> his case. His relations with important political and scientific figures of the time, such as Joseph Fourier and Silvestre de Sacy helped him, although in some periods he lived exiled from the scientific community.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} year, Amazing {{contained}} primarily reprinted material. It was proving difficult to attract new, high-quality material, and Gernsback's slowness at paying his authors <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>help.</b> Writers such as H.P. Lovecraft, H.G. Wells, and Murray Leinster all avoided Amazing because Gernsback {{took so long}} to pay for the stories he printed. The slow payments were probably known to many of the other active pulp writers, which would have further limited the volume of submissions. New writers did appear, but the quality of their stories was often weak.|$|E

5|$|The Mongols {{attacked}} the Dalmatian cities {{for the next}} few years but eventually withdrew without major success, as the mountainous terrain and distance were not suitable for their style of warfare. They pursued Béla IV from town to town in Dalmatia. The Croatian nobility and Dalmatian towns such as Trogir and Rab helped Béla IV to escape. After this failure, the Mongols retreated and Béla IV rewarded the Croatian towns and nobility. Only the city of Split <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> Béla IV in his escape.|$|E
5|$|The close {{relations}} with Byzantium, however, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> Prince Vladimir.

Vladimir retreated with his army and many of his people to his fortress on a hill named Oblik, close to the southeastern tip of Lake Skadar. According to the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, he performed a miracle there: the hill was infested with venomous snakes, but when he offered up a prayer to the Lord, their bites became harmless.|$|E

5|$|The infrequency of Tchaikovsky's musical successes, {{won with}} {{tremendous}} effort, exacerbated his lifelong sensitivity to criticism. Nikolai Rubinstein's private fits of rage critiquing his music, most famously attacking the First Piano Concerto, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> matters. His popularity grew, however, as several first-rate artists became willing to perform his compositions. Hans von Bülow premiered the First Piano Concerto and championed other Tchaikovsky works both as pianist and conductor. Other artists included Adele Aus der Ohe, Max Erdmannsdörfer, Eduard Nápravník and Sergei Taneyev.|$|E
5|$|The league {{was unusually}} competitive; {{a mistake in}} early April caused Benfica to lose much of their lead.

A crucial win against Sporting brought back thei title hope, and a week later Benfica won their first league title in ten seasons. The season ended with a loss against Vitória de Setúbal in the Taça de Portugal Final, preventing Benfica from winning their first double since 1987.|$|E
5|$|Alexios {{was able}} to recover a number of {{important}} cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor.

Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with the Byzantines, but he agreed to become Alexios' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108, which marked the end of the Norman threat during Alexios' reign.|$|E

5|$|As dawn {{broke and}} {{visibility}} cleared, the sailors on Ceylon, Vénus and Victor realised {{that they were}} within sight of Saint Denis on Île Bourbon, and thus vulnerable to counterattack from Rowley's flagship Boadicea. Despite hasty repairs, neither Ceylon nor Vénus were seaworthy by 07:30, when British lookouts on the island spotted the three ships and sent word to Rowley. Within ten minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from Africaine to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering Victor to tow Ceylon, but progress was slow and strong winds, which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> the dismasted Ceylon and Vénus, repeatedly broke the tow rope.|$|E
5|$|Having had {{the crown}} {{restored}} to her daughter, Elizabeth immediately proceeded to reward {{those who had}} helped her, giving a castle in Gimes to Blaise Forgách, {{the master of the}} cupbearers, who had mortally wounded Charles. In April, Sigismund was brought to Hungary by his brother Wenceslaus and the queens were pressured into accepting him as Mary's future co-ruler by the Treaty of Győr. Having Charles murdered <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> Elizabeth as much as she hoped it would, however, as Charles's supporters immediately recognized his son Ladislaus as heir and fled to Zagreb. Bishop Paul pawned church estates in order to collect money for an army against the queens.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that his last fight was an 85-minute contest at Shrewsbury in July 1790. This was widely reported in the London press and that of provincial cities but was subsequently denied by newspapers more local to the event. There were unsuccessful attempts after that date to match him against Ben Bryan (sometimes known as Ben Brian, Ben Brain or Ben Bryant), who had by that time defeated Johnson. Indeed, these attempts, conducted by Daniel Mendoza, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> {{the cause of his}} employment with Boulton and Watt as the firm thought that they were a distraction and expressed concern regarding his commitment to his work.|$|E

5|$|Tallstar's Revenge was {{released}} on 2 July 2013. It {{tells the story of}} Tallstar, whose father dies when he is an apprentice during a tunnel collapse. As a result, he attempts to avenge his father Sandgorse's death by killing the cat (a rogue named Sparrow) whom he believes <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> his father escape the tunnel and is therefore responsible. Tallstar leaves his Clan to track down Sparrow and briefly travels with a house cat named Jake, who is later revealed to be the father of Firestar (the main protagonist of the original six books). When he meets up with Sparrow, Tallstar discovers that his father actually sacrificed himself to allow the other cat to escape and does not carry through with his intended vengeance, instead saving Sparrow's life when Sparrow slides down a cliff and near a road.|$|E
5|$|This {{trend was}} {{documented}} by the Dean of Manchester, Reverend William Herbert. He collected samples and compiled information on {{many aspects of}} the saffron crocus. He was concerned about the steady decline in saffron cultivation {{over the course of the}} 17th century and the dawn of the Industrial Revolution; the introduction in Europe of easily grown maize and potatoes, which steadily took over lands formerly flush with corms, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>help.</b> In addition, the elite who traditionally comprised the bulk of the saffron market were now growing increasingly interested in such intriguing new arrivals as chocolate, coffee, tea, and vanilla. Only in the south of France or in Italy and Spain, where the saffron harvest was culturally primal, did significant cultivation prevail.|$|E
5|$|Villani and the Buonaccorsi {{had gained}} an unsavory {{reputation}} {{as early as}} 1331, when Villani was tried (and cleared) for barratry {{for his part in}} building the new third circuit of walls around Florence. Charles, Duke of Calabria had granted the Buonaccorsi the right to tax three of the six districts of Florence, which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> Villani's reputation amongst his fellow citizens. In early June 1342, partners and agents of the Buonaccorsi suddenly fled Florence, Avignon, and Naples, following bankruptcy proceedings by creditors, nearly all of whom had deposits in the Buonaccorsi bank. Like other Florentine bankers and companies having difficulty with bankruptcy at the time, in September 1342 they supported the move to invite WalterVI of Brienne to become the next signor of Florence. Walter later suspended all legal actions taken against the Buonaccorsi and other company partners for nearly a year.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe study {{adaptive}} {{information of}} varying cardinality for linear problems defined on a separable Banach space. It {{is known that}} for linear problems adaptive information of fixed cardinality <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> in the worst case setting. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> also in the average case setting with Gaussian measures. We prove that in the worst case setting a similar result holds for information of varying cardinality. In the average case setting with Gaussian measures, information of varying cardinality can be more powerful than information of fixed cardinality. However, optimal information has a structure which is almost as simple as nonadaptive information of fixed cardinality. We also give a condition under which varying cardinality <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help.</b> These results are useful for deriving tight bounds on complexity, which is also studied in this paper...|$|R
