In this system, the cells {{act as the}} activation source {{as well as the}} target cells for the DNA damage. The study was performed using 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene and cyclophosphamide, as pro-mutagens and mitomycin C as a <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> <b>mutagen.</b> In both cell lines a significant micronucleus induction was observed after exposure to each test compound, starting from 25 nM for 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, 8 μM for benzo[a]pyrene, 0. 5 mM for cyclophosphamide and 0. 4 μM for mitomycin C. A period of 24 h treatment and 48 h growth was sufficient for induction and expression of micronuclei. The two hepatoma lines behave in a similar way with regard to the pro-mutagen activation. The results obtained in this study with these differentiated hepatoma lines demonstrate that they are metabolically competent to activate the promutagens 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene and cyclophosphamide into their biologically active metabolites as measured by micronucleus induction in our experiments. However, the variable dose responses to 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene in some of the repeated experiments, suggest unstable activity of enzymes involved in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons metabolism in these cell lines.

40|$|Purpose: Determination of the {{mutagenic}} potential of new biologically active compounds {{is of great}} concern for preliminary toxicity testing and drug development. Methods: The mutagenic and antimutagenic effects of some quinoline- and isoquinoline-sulfonamide analogs of aripiprazole (1 - 8), which display potent antidepressant, anxiolytic, and antipsychotic properties, were evaluated using the Vibrio harveyi assay and OSIRIS Property Explorer software. Additionally, the Ames test {{was used as the}} reference. Results: In silico prediction showed that compounds 5 (N-(3 -(4 -(2, 3 -dichlorophenyl) piperazin- 1 -yl) propyl) quinoline- 7 -sulfonamide) and 6 (N-(4 -(4 -(2, 3 -Dichlorophenyl) piperazin- 1 -yl) butyl) quinoline- 7 -sulfonamide) trigger a mutagenic structural alert. However, this was not confirmed by in vitro assays, as none of the tested compounds displayed mutagenic activity against all tested strains of bacteria. Moreover, compounds 1 - 8 displayed a protective effect against the mutagenicity induced by a <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> <b>mutagen</b> NQNO. The most beneficial antimutagenic properties showed compound 5 which exhibited strong antimutagenic properties in all tested V. harveyi strains. High antimutagenic potency of this compound was confirmed in the Ames TA 100 assay system. Conclusion: Newly synthesized azinesulfonamide analogs of aripiprazole may be considered as genotoxically safe as they do not display mutagenic activity on the tester strains. Moreover, the tested compounds demonstrated significant antimutagenic properties that can be valuable for prevention of the NQNO genotoxicity. Additionally, it appears that the Vibrio harveyi assay can be applied for primary mutagenicity and antimutagenicity assessment of chemical substances, thus, representing a useful alternative tool for compounds safety evaluation...|$|E

The crude compound extracted from Eclipta alba was considered as antimutagen and analyzed in this experiment. Two strains of Salmonella typhimurium, TA 163 and TA 96 {{were used to}} analyze the test. These two strains are confirmed as histidine requiring mutant strains. When the mutagen is added to the culture, the strain is mutated back, thereby loosing the histidine dependence for its growth. By this study, the crude compound of Eclipta alba prevents the strain to be mutated back to the non dependence for the genotyping of the Salmonella strains were performed by histidine requirement, rfa mutation analysis, UVrB mutation, R-factor analysis toxicity tests and antimutagenicity assay.   The antimutagens obtained from the plant extract were determined for antimutagenic activity against <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> <b>mutagens</b> and mutagen needing activation. For <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> <b>mutagens,</b> NPD (N- nitro-o-phenyl diamine), MNNG (N- methyl-N-nitro-N-nitro soguanidine) and NaNa 3 (sodium azide) with 1 mg of the plant extract gives 98 %, 95. 2 % and 90. 7 % inhibition the reverted colonies were observed whereas the mutagen needing activation 2 -AAf (2 -acetyl aminofluorine) gives 96. 6 % inhibition was observed. These above results indicated that the extract could inhibit the mutagenicity induced by <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> <b>mutagens</b> as well as mutagens needing activation.

40|$|To whom {{requests}} for reprints should be addressed The broccoli constituent sulforaphane (l-isothiocyanate- 4 -methylsulfinylbutane) has previously been shown to protect rats against 9, 10 -dimethyl-lr 2 -benz[a]anthracene tumori-genesis, thought to be due, at least in part, to induction of phase II detoxification. We investigated the ability of sulforaphane to also inhibit the phase I enzyme cytochrome P 450 isoenzyme 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1), {{which is responsible for}} activation of several carcinogens, including dialkylnitros-amines. Using the / 7 -nitrophenol hydroxylation assay in microsomes from livers of acetone-treated Sprague-Dawley rats, sulforaphane was shown to be a potent competi-tive inhibitor of CYP 2 E 1 with a Kx of 37. 0 ± 4. 5 uM. In view of this result, we studied the capacity of sulforaphane to inhibit the genotoxicity of /V-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). Sulforaphane at concentrations of> 0. 8 uM inhibited the mutagenicity of NDMA (4. 4 mg/plate) in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 100 after pre-incubation for 45 min with cytosol extract from livers of Balb/c mice pre-treated with acetone. Unscheduled DNA synthesis induced by NDMA (33. 5 (lM) in mouse hepatocytes was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by sulforaphane at 0. 064 - 20 uM. Sulforaphane was unable to inhibit muta-genicity of sodium azide (5 (ig/plate), a <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> <b>mutagen,</b> in the Salmonella assay. It was not itself genotoxic in hepatocytes, as measured by unscheduled DNA synthesis, or mutagenic in the strain of Salmonella employed and cytotoxic only at high concentrations (5 = 03 mM). These findings suggest that inhibition of CYP 2 E 1 by sulforaphane may offer chemoprotection against carcinogenic substrates of this enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Dissertation (PhD) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2004. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This thesis {{provides}} the first scientific {{evidence on the}} cancer modulating properties of two unique South African herbal teas, rooibos (Aspalathus Iinearis) and honeybush (Cyclopia intermedia) utilizing in vitro {{as well as in}} vivo carcinogenesis assays by: • Demonstrating the in vitro antimutagenic activity of aqueous extracts of the herbal teas against the metabolic activated mutagens, 2 -acetylaminofluorene (2 - AAF) and the mycotoxin, aflatoxin B 1 (AFB,) as well as, to a certain extent, against the <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> <b>mutagen,</b> hydrogen peroxide, utilizing the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. • Increasing the activity of hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes, glutathione Stransferase alpha and UPD-glucuronosyl transferase, and reduced the oxidative stress by stabilizing the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) resulting in an increased hepatic reduced to oxidized glutathione ratio (GSG:GSSG). No toxic effects were noticed in rats consuming the herbal teas for 10 weeks as their sole source of drinking fluid. • Demonstrating the ex vivo modulation of 2 -AAF- and AFB 1 -induced mutagenesis by sub- cellular hepatic fractions of rats consuming the herbal teas in the Salmonella mutagenicity assay. Hepatic cytosolic fractions protected against mutagenesis of both mutagens, while the microsomal fractions exhibited a reduced capacity to metabolize AFB 1 to its active mutagenic metabolite. • Providing evidence for the in vivo modulation of tumour promotion using the liver as well as the two-stage skin carcinogenesis animal models. The unprocessed herbal teas arrested proliferation of the placental form of glutathione-Stransferase (GSTP+) altered cells as well as reduced the total number of enzyme altered foci in the liver of rats. Topical application of polyphenolic fractions of the various herbal teas prior to 12 - 0 -tetra-decanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) tumour promotion, reduced tumour formation in mouse skin initiated with 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[ajanthracene (DMBA). The protective effect was illustrated by a decreased tumour incidence, a reduction in tumour volume as well as a delayed onset of tumour development. The f 1 avanol/proanthocyanidin content of the fractions could playa major role in the protection against skin tumour promotion. • Proposing possible mechanisms whereby rooibos and honeybush herbal teas could exert their cancer modulating properties with respect to in vitro and ex vivo antimutagenicity, in vivo oxidative status and reduced tumour promotion. • Providing evidence that the herbal teas mimic the cancer modulating properties of green and black teas although differences exist, presumably due to differences in the polyphenolic constituents. • Suggesting that rooibos and honeybush herbal teas may play an important role as chemopreventive agents in the modulation of cancer. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Hierdie tesis bevat die eerste ondersoek na die effek van waterige en polifenoliese ekstrakte van rooibos (Aspalathus Iinearis) en heuningbos (Cyclopia intermedia) op verskeie aspekte van kankerontwikkeling. Die twee kruietees is uniek aan Suid-Afrika en kan 'n belangrike rol speel in die voorkoming van kanker. Verskillende in vitro so wei as in vivo studies het die volgende getoon: • Antimutageniese aktiwiteite teen die metabolies-geaktiveerde mutagene, 2 - asetielaminofluoreen (2 -AAF) en die mikotoksien, aflatoksien B 1 (AFB 1) in die Salmonella fyphimurium mutagenisiteitstoets. 'n Beperkte mate van beskerming is ook verleen teen die oksidatiewe mutageen, waterstofperoksied, sonder metaboliese aktivering. • Verhoogde aktiwiteite van die fase II ensieme, glutatioon S-tranferase alfa en UDP-glukuronidase, wat liggaamsvreemde verbindings metaboliseer. Die kruietees verlaag die oksidasietoestand soos weerspieel word deur 'n toename van gereduseerde glutatioon tot die geoksideerde vorm in die lewer van rotte wat 10 weke hierdie kruietees gedrink he!. Die kruietees het geen toksiese uitwerking op die rotte gehad nie. • Antimutageniese aktiwiteite van subselluiE~re fraksies van die lewer teenoor 2 - AAF en AFB 1 in die Salmonella toets. Die sitosolfraksie van die rotlewer bied beskerming teen die ge"induseerde mutagenese van beide mutagene, terwyl die mikrosomale fraksie ook die metaboliese aktivering van AFB 1 na die aktiewe mutageniese metaboliet verminder. • In vivo modulering van kankerpromosie met behulp van bekende rotlewer en muisvel kankerontwikkelingsmodelle. In die lewermodel het die ongeprosesseerde kruietees beide die ontwikkeling en getal van GSTP+ fokusse onderskeidelik vertraag en verminder. In die geval van die velkankermodel het aanwending van polifenoliese fraksies van die kruietees beskerming gebied teen die ontwikkeling van velkankers by muise. Die aantal en grootte van die tumors het afgeneem terwyl die verskyning daarvan ook vertraag is. • Verskeie meganismes waardeur rooibos- en heuningboslee moonllik kanker kan moduleer word voorgeslel. Verskille in die polifenoliese sameslelling asook hul onderskeie konsenlrasies kan 'n belangrike rol speel in die kankerveranderende effekle van die lees. • Oal gereelde inname van rooibos- en/of heuningboslee moonllik 'n belangrike rol kan speel in die voorkoming van dieel- en omgewings-geYnduseerde kankers...|$|E

These high priority DBPs are among the by-products to be analyzed for the USEPA’s Integrated Disinfection By-product Research Project (Four Lab Study) developed to evaluate the toxicity of the complex mixture of DBPs present in treated water. The traditional method for characterization of halogenated furanones involves liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and a time intensive derivatization step for gas chromatography analysis. In order to remove the derivatization step and provide a more efficient method to characterize halofuranones in the Four Lab Study’s water sample, a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed, using electrospray ionization. Halofuranones MX, MBA, BMX- 1 and BMX- 3 were successfully quantified through LC-ESI-MS/MS at the ng/L level in treated water samples. Method linearity was observed (r 2 ≥ 0. 98) with accurate and reproducible results. Compared to current detection methods, this LC-MS/MS method provides a faster yet highly sensitive and selective method to quantify halofuranones at the ng/L level...|$|R

A pilot-plant study with alternative disinfectants was carried out with stored water of the Rivers Rhine and Meuse. It was demonstrated that the increase of <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> <b>mutagens</b> after treatment with chlorine dioxide {{is similar to the}} effect of chlorination. Ozonation of Rhine water reduced the mutagenic activity for Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 both with and without metabolic activation. UV alone hardly affects the mutagenicity of the stored river water for S. typh. TA 98. In all studies, practically no mutagenic activity for S. typh. TA 100 was found. Although remarkable changes in the concentration of individual organic compounds are reported, the identity of the mutagens detected is yet unclear. Compounds of possible interest due to their removal by ozonation are 1, 3, 3 -trimethyloxindole, dicyclopentadiene and several alkylquinolines. Compounds which might be responsible for the increased mutagenicity after chlorination are two brominated acetonitriles and tri(2 -chlorethyl) phosphate. Furthermore, the concentration procedure with adsorption on XAD resin and the subsequent elution step may have affected the results. It is proposed to focus further research more on the less volatile by-products of disinfection than on the trihalomethanes...|$|R

The Ames Salmonella/microsome assay was used along with chemical analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to evaluate the genotoxicity of soil and groundwater samples from a former wood treatment facility. Soil samples were taken from land treatment unit cells undergoing bioremediation under various environmental conditions. Groundwater samples were taken during three points of remediation in a pump and treat/dual bioreactor system. In general, soil samples tested positive for genotoxicity with metabolic activation and negative without metabolic activation in the Salmonella/microsome assay.

In all three cell lines a significant clastogenic and SCE inducing response was observed after exposure to each test compound. Furthermore, activities of the two enzymes aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and aldrinepoxidase, which play major roles in the cytochrome P 450 -dependent metabolism, could be determined in all cell lines.

40|$|The {{development}} of oral hepatitis C virus <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> antivirals has revolutionized the therapeutic field. Nowadays, multiple safe and highly effective antiviral regimens are commercially available to treat adults with hepatitis C infection. These new regimens {{for the first}} time, genuinely raise the prospects of eradicating hepatitis C virus. However, many challenges remain: from identifying infected individuals to optimizing treatment and ensuring global access to antiviral therapy to all population groups, including children. The only drugs currently approved for children with chronic hepatitis C virus infection are pegylated interferon and ribavirin. There are four registered ongoing pediatric trials assessing safety and efficacy of <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> antivirals but their current completion timelines are years away. Herein, we summarize {{the state of the}} art of <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> antivirals development for adult and children and highlight the crucial importance of overcoming barriers to treating children with hepatitis C virus...|$|R

Therefore new strategy are interested in finding a potent phytotherapeutic agent with non toxic properties. The goal of the present study to evaluate the potential of Doash- leaves water extracts Origanum majorana (2 % w/v) as antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic effects against known• [...] . mutagens classes (heterocyclic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrosoamines and <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> carcinogens) in vivo and in vitro. The antimutagenic activity was determined by Ames test using different strains of Salmonella Typhimurium. Results obtained showed that, Doash extract possesses powerful antimutagenic against different mutagene. In vivo study revealed that treatment of rats with Doash extracts for one day or 30 days caused a decrease in hepatic cytochrome P 450 enzymes such as CYP 2 B, CYP 2 El and CYPIA, the latter P 450 subfamily being closely associated with the inhibition of chemical carcinogens inactivation. Aqueous Doash tea extract diminishes the excretion of indirect <b>acting</b> <b>mutagens</b> in rats treated with (2 -Amino- 3 -methylimidiazol-[4, 50 -f]quinoiine) IQ or (2 - hydroxyamino- 3 -methyl- 3 H-imidazo[4, 5,f] quinoline) PhIP; the antimutagenic effect associated with elevation of hepatic CYPIA 2 expression which is involved in the metabolism of carcinogens (IQ and PhIP). HPLC/MS analysis of Doash extract showed that a highest peak related to high terpens contents. Based on these records, it appears that Doash tea extract can in vivo affect the mutagenicity of various structurally diverse promutagens including many food-borne carcinogen, by decreasing cytochrome P 450 -mediated activation. It was concluded that, daily intake of Doash tea may protect against the conversion of promutagene to mutagene and scavenging carcinogen from environmental contact. More study is needed to examine the mechanistic action of active ingredients of Doash extract fractions on cellular and molecular level. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
