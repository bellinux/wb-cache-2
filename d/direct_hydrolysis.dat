The higher affinity sites bind 45 nmol calcium/mg membrane protein with a KD of 3 µM. Adrenalectomy increases the number of the higher affinity sites and the corresponding KD. Plasma membranes exhibit a (Na+-K+) -independent-Mg 2 +-ATPase activity which is not activated by calcium between 0. 1 µM and 10 mM CaCl 2. Calcium can, with less efficiency, substitute for magnesium as a cofactor for the (Na+-K+) -independent ATPase. Both Mg 2 +- and Ca 2 +-ATPase activities are identical with respect to pH dependence, nucleotide specificity and sensitivity to inhibitors. But when calcium is substituted for magnesium, there is no detectable membrane phosphorylation from [γ- 32 P] ATP as it is found in the presence of magnesium. The existence of high affinity binding sites for calcium in liver plasma membranes is compatible with a regulatory role of this ion in membrane enzymic mechanisms or in hormone actions.
