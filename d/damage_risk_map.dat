40|$|The flood {{damage of}} {{engineering}} structures in rivers because of scour near pumping stations, bridge structures – abutments, guide banks, dams, etc. leads to considerable environmental and economical losses. The reason of scour is multiple floods and therefore scour hole parameters near structures under clear-water conditions are summed up and increase from flood to flood. When depth of scour hole reaches critical value for foundations, structure usually is destroyed. To estimate the engineering structures safety and stability the flood damage risk assessment {{should be performed}} and in necessary cases protection measures {{should be used to}} prevent engineering structures from failure. A method for flood damage risk assessment at abutments is presented. We propose to calculate flood damage risk factor using two scour calculation methods: calculation method of scour development at abutments during the multiple floods and calculation method of equilibrium depth of scour at abutments. The theoretical analysis of the equilibrium depth of scour calculation method is made. The flood damage risk factor of abutment can be calculated as a ratio between hs, the scour depth during/after the multiple floods of certain probability, and hequil., the equilibrium depth of scour hole at the abutments of the same probability. For critical conditions, when the developed scour hole is close to the equilibrium conditions, emergency protection measures should be taken and such bridge construction should be included into flood <b>damage</b> <b>risk</b> <b>map...</b>|$|E

Different methodologies for the computation of flood depth and inundation extent of varying flood return periods (hazard) are compared.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of 2007 / 60 /EC Directive requires European countries to implement flood hazard and flood <b>risk</b> <b>maps</b> {{by the end}} of 2013. Flood risk is the product of flood hazard, vulnerability and exposure, all three to be estimated with comparable level of accuracy. The route to flood risk assessment is consequently much more than hydraulic modelling of inundation, that is hazard mapping. While hazard maps have already been implemented in many countries, quantitative <b>damage</b> and <b>risk</b> <b>maps</b> are still at a preliminary level. A parsimonious quasi- 2 -D hydraulic model is here adopted, having many advantages in terms of easy set-up. It is here evaluated as being accurate in flood depth estimation in urban areas with a high-resolution and up-to-date Digital Surface Model (DSM). The accuracy, estimated by comparison with marble-plate records of a historic flood in the city of Florence, is characterized in the downtown's most flooded area by a bias of a very few centimetres and a determination coefficient of 0. 73. The average risk is found to be about 14 € m − 2 yr − 1, corresponding to about 8. 3 % of residents' income. The spatial distribution of estimated risk highlights a complex interaction between the flood pattern and the building characteristics. As a final example application, the estimated risk values have been used to compare different retrofitting measures. Proceeding through the risk estimation steps, a new micro-scale potential damage assessment method is proposed. This is based on the georeferenced census system as the optimal compromise between spatial detail and open availability of socio-economic data. The results of flood risk assessment at the census section scale resolve most of the risk spatial variability, and they can be easily aggregated to whatever upper scale is needed given that they are geographically defined as contiguous polygons. Damage is calculated through stage–damage curves, starting from census data on building type and function, for the main categories in the study area: structures, household contents and commercial contents. This method is tested {{in the area of the}} St. Croce district in Florence, one of the most seriously affected in the famous 1966 flood...|$|R

40|$|Hurricane surge floods {{have caused}} devastating damage along coastal areas {{all over the}} world. Yet many {{recent studies have shown}} that global warming could {{increase}} the hurricane flooding damage by hurricane intensification and sea level rise. Hence, the ability to predict surge elevations and to use this information for damage estimation is fundamental for saving lives and protecting property. In this study, we developed a framework that allows one to acquire information of hurricane flooding damage (e. g. structural damage, population being affected, flooded area, etc.) for different hurricanes. This framework is based on Surge Response Functions (SRFs). SRFs are physical scaling laws derived from a suite of discrete ADvanced CIRCulation Model (ADCIRC) simulations and represent surge values as a function of hurricane parameters. The advantage of this SRF-based approach is {{that a large number of}} storms can be efficiently evaluated and considered in the analysis, without losing accuracy in the surge estimates. To extrapolate the surge water elevation inland, SRF zones were defined within which the water elevation was considered horizontal. Individual parcel flood damage was calculated based on the flood water depth and damage vs. water depth curves included in the Federal Emergency Management Agency?s (FEMA) application HAZUS. Parcel data (property value, population) and business data (employee size, and sales volume) are collected and used to conduct risk analysis under different future climate scenarios. Expected changes for future climate scenarios (i. e., IPCC scenarios B 1, A 1 B and A 1 FI for the 2030 ?s and 2080 ?s) were considered by accounting for projected sea surface temperature increases and sea level rise, which modify the probability distribution of hurricane central pressure and change the baseline of damage calculation, respectively. Flood <b>risk</b> estimates and <b>maps</b> are developed for Corpus Christi in Texas, and Gulfport in Mississippi. For the case of Corpus Christi, it was found that, as the projected sea surface temperature increased, higher surge values are more likely to occur, as expected, resulting in higher expected <b>damage.</b> The <b>risk</b> <b>map</b> of Port Aransas in the Corpus Christi area, for example, shows that the risk is in the range of 1 % to 4 % of the property value for current climate conditions, and shifts to 1 % to 8 % for the 2030 ?s and 1 % to 14 % for the 2080 ?s. The concept of the parameterized hurricane damage analysis is also used to construct a web-based game ?VisHurricane? which is intent to be used as an educational tool for K- 12 students to arise their attention of current issues on climate change and potential future hurricane surge flooding risk...|$|R
