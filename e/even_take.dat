5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are {{responsible}} for several unique volcanological objects. Small volcanic particles are carried and formed by the wind, chilling quickly into teardrop-shaped glassy fragments known as Pele's tears (after Pele, the Hawaiian volcano deity). During especially high winds these chunks may <b>even</b> <b>take</b> the form of long drawn-out strands, known as Pele's hair. Sometimes basalt aerates into reticulite, the lowest density rock type on earth.|$|E
5|$|According to Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen, it took long {{to persuade}} Meisdalshagen to <b>even</b> <b>take</b> the post as Minister of Finance, {{and he was}} more {{interested}} in agro-economical questions than traditional planning of the economy. It was even said that Gerhardsen's Cabinet had an interest in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where he had driven through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, measured in the amount of money earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the Main Agreement for Agriculture, , was introduced. It regulated future price negotiations, and institutionalized the negotiating partners: the state {{on one side of the}} table, the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other.|$|E
5|$|Lance Henriksen was {{concerned}} {{that it would be}} out of character for Frank Black to recklessly take untested drugs, and suggested adding a line of dialogue—"I don't <b>even</b> <b>take</b> aspirin"—to the script to help clue the audience in to the fact that his involvement in the clinical trial was an attempt to aid his daughter. The episode begins with a quotation translated from classical Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero's treatise De finibus bonorum et malorum—"I remember the very things I do not wish to; I cannot forget the things I wish to forget". The phrase is found at the beginning of Book II of the work.|$|E

5|$|Receiving {{light and}} other signals from distant astronomical sources can <b>even</b> <b>take</b> much longer. For example, {{it has taken}} 13billion (13) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they {{appeared}} 13billion years ago, {{when the universe was}} less than a billion years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} {{crossover}} between {{many different}} Nintendo franchises, including Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, Donkey Kong, Metroid, Mother, F-Zero, Yoshi, Kirby, and Pokémon. It presents a cast of characters and locations from these franchises and allows players to use each character's unique skill sets and <b>even</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the stage's offensive events to inflict damage, recover health, and ultimately attempt to knock opponent characters off the stage. It received mostly positive reviews from the media and was commercially successful, selling over 5million copies worldwide by 2001, with 2.93million sold in the United States and 1.97million copies sold in Japan. As {{a result of this}} success, the game spawned a series of sequels for each successive Nintendo console.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of his fortune, however, came from moneylending. Up until their expulsion in 1290, the major moneylenders in England were Jews, who were not covered by Christian bans on usury. During the reign of Henry III, however, the Jews were taxed at extortionate rates, and many were forced to sell acquired debts at reduced prices. These debts were lucrative, because the buyers were not bound by the existing contract. They could demand higher rates, or sometimes <b>even</b> <b>take</b> forfeit in land. Stratton {{was one of the}} greater beneficiaries of the opportunities offered by trading in Jewish debts. From at least 1271 he was also associated with the Riccardi, a major Italian financier family.|$|E

5|$|There are {{texts in}} which Isis travels {{in the wider}} world. She moves among {{ordinary}} humans who are unaware of her identity, and she even appeals to these people for help. This is another unusual circumstance, for in Egyptian myth, gods and humans are normally separate. As {{in the first phase}} of the myth, she often has the aid of other deities, who protect her son in her absence. According to one magical spell, seven minor scorpion deities travel with and guard Isis as she seeks help for Horus. They <b>even</b> <b>take</b> revenge on a wealthy woman who has refused to help Isis by stinging the woman's son, making it necessary for Isis to heal the blameless child. This story conveys a moral message that the poor can be more virtuous than the wealthy and illustrates Isis's fair and compassionate nature.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{displays}} are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones. Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission. The manus flutter is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its primary feathers in its wings. A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts. Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack. Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting {{to bring down the}} leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may <b>even</b> <b>take</b> place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.|$|E
25|$|Despite their importance, the {{population}} of little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) in the region appear to be diminishing. Although not all the species protected in this ZEPA SPA can be listed, the protected area is a migratory crossing site and wintertime nesting area that, along with the Riberas de Castronuño (Valladolid) nature reserve, is frequented by many waterfowl (cranes, geese, etc.), some of which <b>even</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the area ephemeral ponds for nesting during humid winters.|$|E

25|$|A virgin queen is a {{queen bee}} {{that has not}} mated with a drone. Virgins are {{intermediate}} in size between workers and mated, laying queens, and are much more active than the latter. They are hard to spot while inspecting a frame, because they run across the comb, climbing over worker bees if necessary, and may <b>even</b> <b>take</b> flight if sufficiently disturbed. Virgin queens can often be found clinging to the walls or corners of a hive during inspections.|$|E
25|$|In some {{countries}} such anglicisation {{is seen as}} relatively benign, {{and the use of}} English words may <b>even</b> <b>take</b> on a chic aspect. In Japan, marketing products for the domestic market often involves using English or pseudo-English brand names and slogans. In other countries, anglicisation is seen much more negatively, and there are efforts by public-interest groups and governments to reverse the trend; for example, the Académie française in France insists on the use of French neologisms to describe technological inventions in place of imported English terms.|$|E
25|$|Many of our {{important}} source documents, {{such as the}} Assyrian King List, are the products of government and religious establishments. They often have a built-in slant {{in favor of the}} king or god in charge. A king may <b>even</b> <b>take</b> credit for a battle or construction project of an earlier ruler. The Assyrians in particular have a literary tradition of always putting the best possible face on history. The tablets or inscriptions in question still have value, though one does have to keep the slant in mind.|$|E

Lithuania started well, winning {{the first quarter}} 29–17, and leading 34–23 in the second. However, the Italians managed {{to take the lead}} before half time and a close game ensued. Lithuanians were able to tie the game in the third quarter (53–53) and <b>even</b> <b>take</b> the lead in the fourth (78–73); however, at the buzzer the Italians celebrated a 91–100 victory, shattering the Lithuanian dream of Olympic gold.|$|E

25|$|From 1819 until Emmerich's {{death in}} 1824, Brentano filled many {{notebooks}} with accounts of her visions involving {{scenes from the}} New Testament {{and the life of}} the Virgin Mary. Because Emmerich only spoke the Westphalian dialect, Brentano could not transcribe her words directly, and often could not <b>even</b> <b>take</b> notes in her presence. Brentano would quickly write a set of notes based on what he remembered of the conversations he had with Emmerich in standard German when he returned to his own apartment. Brentano edited the notes later, years after the death of Emmerich.|$|E
25|$|The {{intuitive}} {{concept of}} dimension of a geometric object X {{is the number}} of independent parameters one needs to pick out a unique point inside. However, any point specified by two parameters can be instead specified by one, because the cardinality of the real plane is equal to the cardinality of the real line (this can be seen by an argument involving interweaving the digits of two numbers to yield a single number encoding the same information). The example of a space-filling curve shows that one can <b>even</b> <b>take</b> one real number into two both surjectively (so all pairs of numbers are covered) and continuously, so that a one-dimensional object completely fills up a higher-dimensional object.|$|E
25|$|In February 2004 Nikolai Moiseyev, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of Russian Federal Space Agency (FSA) told journalists that the Kliper project had been included in the Russian federal space program for 2005-15. At that point he announced that if the program is implemented successfully the first launch may <b>even</b> <b>take</b> place in five years' time. Kliper had been developed since 2000 and reportedly relied heavily on research studies as well as proposals for a small Russian lifting body spacecraft from the 1990s. Externally its design was comparable to the cancelled European minishuttle Hermes or the NASA study X-38. It was planned to be the successor to the veteran spacecraft Soyuz, which has been built in various modifications since 1961.|$|E
