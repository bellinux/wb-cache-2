30|$|The {{magnitude}} squared coherence {{is determined}} using the “mscohere” subroutine in MATLAB. Filtered time sequence data from two separate pixel locations are inputs to the subroutine. The sampling frequency {{is also an}} input to the “mscohere” subroutine. This subroutine uses Welch’s Overlapped Segment Averaging procedure. Use of this procedure requires input information related to window type, window size, and size of overlapped region. The averaging scheme employs <b>Hanning</b> <b>windowing.</b> The window size is equivalent to {{one quarter of the}} length of the filtered time sequence array of grayscale data. This is the same as a quarter of the number of shadowgraph flow visualization images acquired and analyzed. For example, there are 21, 620 images captured during the test on 05 April 2018, so each window consists of 5405 data points (21, 620 divided by 4).

Thus the image(s) must be regridded into a spatially uniform, or angularly uniform, coordinate system with some pre-defined resolution. Frequently the ending resolution is not the resolution at which the data was observed with. The registration algorithm designer and end product user are presented with a multitude of possible resampling methods each of which modify the spatial frequency content of the data in some way. The {{purpose of this paper}} is threefold: (1) to show how an imaging system modifies the scene from an end to end optical systems analysis approach, (2) to develop a generalized resampling model, and (3) empirically apply the model to simulated radiometric scene data and tabulate the results. A <b>Hanning</b> <b>windowed</b> sinc interpolator method will be developed based upon the optical characterization of the system. It will be discussed in terms of the effects and limitations of sampling, aliasing, spectral leakage, and computational complexity. Simulated radiometric scene data will be used to demonstrate each of the algorithms. A high resolution scene will be "grown" using a fractal growth algorithm based on mid-point recursion techniques. The result scene data will be convolved with a point spread function representing the optical response.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe problem of propagation of vertically polarized radiowaves in an inhomogeneous atmosphere and over rough ocean surfaces is solved using the parabolic equation method. The {{solution of the}} parabolic equation is accomplished {{through the use of}} the Fourier split-step algorithm. Formulation of the equations is based upon (1) recognizing that the Fourier kernels of the transform equations in the split step algorithm represent planes waves and (2) compensating for the effects of rough ocean surfaces by using a rough surface reduction factor directly in the spectral domain. To accomplish this a redefinition of the Fourier transform pair is done to ensure mathematical consistency. The formulation also incorporates the first and second derivatives of the refractivity index to accommodate steep gradients in the refractivity profile. <b>Hanning</b> <b>windows</b> are used in both the spatial and wavenumber domains to contain computational requirements.
