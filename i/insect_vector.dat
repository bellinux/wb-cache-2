5|$|In 1881, Dr. Carlos Finlay, a Scottish {{physician}} practising in Havana, {{theorized that}} yellow fever was transmitted by a specific mosquito, later designated Aedes aegypti. The theory remained controversial {{for twenty years}} until confirmed in 1901 by Walter Reed. This was the first scientific proof of a disease being transmitted exclusively by an <b>insect</b> <b>vector,</b> and demonstrated that control of such diseases necessarily entailed control or eradication of its <b>insect</b> <b>vector.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Chagas-endemic areas, {{the main}} mode of {{transmission}} is through an <b>insect</b> <b>vector</b> called a triatomine bug. A triatomine becomes infected with T. cruzi by feeding on the blood of an infected person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{wildlife}} reservoirs for Trypanosoma cruzi in the United States include opossums, raccoons, armadillos, squirrels, woodrats, and mice. Opossums {{are particularly}} important as reservoirs, because the parasite can complete its life cycle in the anal glands of this animal without having to re-enter the <b>insect</b> <b>vector.</b> Recorded prevalence of the disease in opossums in the U.S. ranges from 8.3% to 37.5%.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} parasites {{can affect the}} lungs, {{including}} Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Plasmodium malariae. These organisms typically enter the body through {{direct contact with the}} skin, ingestion, or via an <b>insect</b> <b>vector.</b> Except for Paragonimus westermani, most parasites do not affect specifically the lungs but involve the lungs secondarily to other sites. Some parasites, in particular those belonging to the Ascaris and Strongyloides genera, stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction, which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia. In other infections, such as malaria, lung involvement is due primarily to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation. In the developed world these infections are most common in people returning from travel or in immigrants. Around the world, these infections are most common in the immunodeficient.|$|E
25|$|Beet curly top virus (BCTV) is a {{pathogenic}} plant virus of {{the family}} Geminiviridae, containing a single-stranded DNA. The Geminiviridae family consists of four types (Curtovirus, Mastrevirus, Topocuvirus, and Begomovirus) based on their host range, virus genome structure, and type of <b>insect</b> <b>vector.</b> BCTV is a Curtovirus affecting hundreds of plants. The only known vector is the beet leafhopper, which is native to the Western United States.|$|E

The caterpillars were to be dropped in Peru on coca fields {{as part of the}} American War on Drugs. As recently as 2002 U.S. entomological anti-drug efforts at Fort Detrick were focused on finding an <b>insect</b> <b>vector</b> for a virus that affects the opium poppy.|$|E

50|$|The fungi produce asexual spores which {{disperse}} by wind, {{water or}} by <b>insect</b> <b>vectors</b> spreading the infection.|$|R
25|$|The life-cycles of Plasmodium species involve several {{different}} stages {{both in the}} insect and the vertebrate host. These stages include sporozoites, which are injected by the <b>insect</b> <b>vector</b> into the vertebrate host's blood. Sporozoites infect the host liver, giving rise to merozoites and (in some species) hypnozoites. These move into the blood where they infect red blood cells. In the red blood cells, the parasites can either form more merozoites to infect more red blood cells, or produce gametocytes which are taken up by insects which feed on the vertebrate host. In the insect host, gametocytes merge to sexually reproduce. After sexual reproduction, parasites grow into new sporozoites, which move to the insect's salivary glands, from which they can infect a vertebrate host bitten by the insect.|$|E
2500|$|Plant viruses {{need to be}} {{transmitted}} by a vector, most often insects such as leafhoppers. One class of viruses, the Rhabdoviridae, has been proposed to actually be insect viruses that have evolved to replicate in plants. The chosen <b>insect</b> <b>vector</b> of a plant virus will often be the determining factor in that virus's host range: it can only infect plants that the <b>insect</b> <b>vector</b> feeds upon. This was shown in part when the old world white fly {{made it to the}} United States, where it transferred many plant viruses into new hosts. Depending on the way they are transmitted, plant viruses are classified as non-persistent, semi-persistent and persistent. In non-persistent transmission, viruses become attached to the distal tip of the stylet of the insect and on the next plant it feeds on, it inoculates it with the virus. Semi-persistent viral transmission involves the virus entering the foregut of the insect. Those viruses that manage to pass through the gut into the haemolymph and then to the salivary glands are known as persistent. There are two sub-classes of persistent viruses: propagative and circulative. Propagative viruses are able to replicate in both the plant and the insect (and may have originally been insect viruses), whereas circulative can not. Circulative viruses are protected inside aphids by the chaperone protein symbionin, produced by bacterial symbionts. [...] Many plant viruses encode within their genome polypeptides with domains essential for transmission by insects. In non-persistent and semi-persistent viruses, these domains are in the coat protein and another protein known as the helper component. A bridging hypothesis has been proposed to explain how these proteins aid in insect-mediated viral transmission. The helper component will bind to the specific domain of the coat protein, and then the insect mouthparts — creating a bridge. In persistent propagative viruses, such as tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), there is often a lipid coat surrounding the proteins that is not seen in other classes of plant viruses. In the case of TSWV, 2 viral proteins are expressed in this lipid envelope. It has been proposed that the viruses bind via these proteins and are then taken into the insect cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis.|$|E
