5|$|Seeking to {{capitalize}} on its new wide-body's potential for growth, Boeing offered an extended-range model, the 767-200ER, {{in its first year}} of service. Ethiopian Airlines placed the <b>first</b> <b>order</b> for the type in December 1982. Featuring increased gross weight and greater fuel capacity, the extended-range model could carry heavier payloads at distances up to , and was targeted at overseas customers. The 767-200ER entered service with El Al Airline on March 27, 1984. The type was mainly ordered by international airlines operating medium-traffic, long-distance flights.|$|E
