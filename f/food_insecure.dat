A Logistic regression model was estimated based on this data with the household food security status (that is <b>food</b> secure and <b>insecure)</b> as the dependent variable and a set of demographic variables as explanatory variables. It was found that about 26 percent of the sampled households are food secure. Further analysis identified household income, household size, marital status, employment status, age and gender of the household head as important determinants of food security. While other variables of importance positively influenced food security, household size and the marital status of the household head were negatively associated with household food security.

The results show that there are significant differences in the proportion of food expenditure among the households of food-secure and food-less secure to the households of food-vulnerable and food-insecure. In each level of household food-secure, household expenditure on instant foods and drinks shows the highest proportion compared to other food groups. The more <b>insecure</b> <b>foods</b> in a household, the higher expenditure proportion for tobacco. In each household group based on the level of food-secure, the households in urban areas have a smaller proportion of rice expenditure compared to the households in rural areas.

40|$|This study uses {{data from}} the December 2003 Food Security Supplement of the CPS to compare the food {{insufficiency}} and insecurity measures with objective measures of food expenditures and objective and subjective measures of food needs. The study examines the general relationships between these variables and finds that reports of food hardships are positively associated with food expenditures and negatively associated with needs. The study goes on to examine reports of food hardships at low very levels of food expenditures, where we conjecture that most people should experience food problems. When expenditures are scaled by an objective measure of needs, {{there is no point}} along the expenditure distribution where {{more than half of the}} survey respondents report experiencing being <b>food</b> insufficient or <b>insecure.</b> However, when expenditures are scaled by a subjective threshold, we observe near-universal reporting of food problems at low levels of expenditures.

40|$|Famine is a localized, {{temporary}} and severe food shortage, often {{perceived as being}} provoked by drought, ecological depletion, or conflict. All these have considerable impacts; however, famine has many other underlying factors. In essence, a mix of poverty fuelled by inequality, unregulated trade, and <b>insecure</b> <b>food</b> systems are what underpin famine. Malthusian theory believes that population growth will increase at a much faster rate than food, putting continual pressure on means of subsistence, suggesting that famine, disease and war ultimately balance human numbers with food supply (Madeley, 2000, p. 37). However, Frank Notestein’s demographic transition theory (Kirk, 1996) provides a counter-acting argument whilst Shiva (2002, p. 37) informs that ‘the world today produces more food per inhabitant than ever before’. It is from this perspective and through a lens of human agency that this paper will identify the causes of famine and analyse counter-measures in order to portray that famine is preventable. Dreze and Sen (1989, p. 47) explain: Famines {{in the modern world}} are preventable by human action…many countries, even some very poor ones, manage consistently to prevent them…when people die of starvation there is almost invariably some massive social failure, whether or not a natural phenomenon had an initiating role in the causal process...|$|R

40|$|Farming systems {{analysis}} is a {{holistic approach to}} the understanding of total livelihood and food security of farm families. A sound knowledge of the prevailing farming systems in an agro ecological zone is pertinent to the generation of agricultural and food security policies for farming families. This ensures that innovations to be developed are suitable to meet the economic needs of the various homogeneous groups and have a high probability of being accepted by the farm families. An earlier study identified 7 factors as some of the proxy variables representing the pillars of food security in rural Nigeria (Obamiro, Doppler and Kormawa, 2003). The study was carried out among 150 farm families in rural areas of Osun state. This present study classified the same set of farm families into 2 farming systems from the same set of data (perennial and permanent rain fed farming systems). The classification is necessary to determine if there are differences in the factors discriminating between the <b>food</b> secure and <b>insecure</b> between each of the farming systems.

Over half of agricultural workers in California, contributing to the state's agriculture economy and providing the nation with over half of all fruits and vegetables, are undocumented. Despite undocumented laborers contributing to the agriculture industry, farm work and labor is among {{one of the lowest}} paid occupations in the U.S. Many undocumented communities suffer from food insecurity due to low wages, forcing families to purchase economically viable unhealthy food. Though existing food pantry and food stamp programs aid in reducing the amount of <b>food</b> <b>insecure</b> individuals, undocumented immigrants are ineligible for social service programs and studies have found that limited English acts as a barrier to food stamp program participation. Due to a lack of education, encounters with government agents, language barriers, undocumented individuals pose higher rates of food insecurity and hunger when compared to legal citizens. The Trump administration is attempting to draft new stricter immigration policies; undocumented individuals who fear being deported under the new policies, limit their interactions with government agencies, social service programs (e.g., food stamps), increasing their susceptibility to food insecurity.|$|E

Much less {{is known about the}} food experiences of homeless people, a group who are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. This study explored the food experiences of street youth, {{one of the fastest growing}} segments of the homeless population in Canada. To gain an in-depth understanding of food insecurity within the context of daily life, ethnographic research was undertaken with street youth at one inner-city drop-in centre in Toronto, Canada. Results of this study reveal that street youth's access to food was precarious amidst the instability and chaos of street life. The day-to-day lives of the street youth encountered in this study were characterized by a constant struggle to find safe, secure shelter, generate income, and obtain sufficient food. In this context, food was a precious commodity. Food access was inextricably linked to and contingent upon conditions of health, shelter, and income. Food access was precarious since everyday food sources-purchased food and charitable <b>food</b> assistance-were ultimately <b>insecure.</b> "Squeegeeing" (washing car windows), the primary source of income for youth in the study, was dependent on the weather, political and public will, and youth's physical health, and thus did not generate enough money to continuously meet basic food needs. Charitable food assistance was considered poor quality and was associated with food sickness. The often unsavoury atmosphere of charitable food programmes, their locations, capacity, and idiosyncratic rules, policies, and hours of operation also affected access. Findings from this study extend the current understanding of food insecurity to homeless youth and offer insight into current responses to hunger and homelessness.

40|$|In Brazil, the {{increasing}} middle class has raised food demand substantially. The Brazilian Savannah (Cerrados) {{is one of}} the rare places where agriculture can expand and address this new demand without jeopardizing the environment. Cerrados has a strictly divided dry and wet season. The dry season lasts from May to September. This long period contributes to various problems such as water shortages, conflicts and <b>insecure</b> <b>food</b> production. Without irrigation, only two crops can be grown per year in this region. Production suffers with a recurrent drought. Because agricultural production is uncertain, irrigation has an important role in this context, but its expansion is limited by water availability. Water conflicts have already occurred in some watersheds, which may jeopardize agriculture and decrease the livelihood of rural communities. In general, water for irrigation is limited to surface water. Therefore, it is important to investigate alternative sources of water, like groundwater. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the groundwater potential for expanding the irrigated area in a small-scale catchment (Buriti Vermelho, DF, Brazil). The current water demand was investigated and simulated by an Irrigation Strategies Simulation Model (MSEI). A daily water balance was computed, which quantified catchment storage over time. In addition, groundwater behavior and availability were investigated by recession curve analysis. The irrigated area was changed using two scenarios that showed different effects in both catchment surface water balance and groundwater levels. A decline in groundwater levels is seen in all scenarios one year after the beginning of extra extraction. With time, water levels may decline beyond the natural recovery capacity, which will certainly penalize poorer farmers and result in areas being taken out of agricultural production...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{representations}} of mean climate conditions, especially {{in areas of}} complex terrain, {{are an important part}} of environmental monitoring systems. As high-resolution satellite monitoring information accumulates with the passage of time, it can be increasingly useful in efforts to better characterize the earth's mean climatology. Current state-of-the-science products rely on complex and sometimes unreliable relationships between elevation and station-based precipitation records, which can result in poor performance in <b>food</b> and water <b>insecure</b> regions with sparse observation networks. These vulnerable areas (like Ethiopia, Afghanistan, or Haiti) are often the critical regions for humanitarian drought monitoring. Here, we show that long period of record geo-synchronous and polar-orbiting satellite observations provide a unique new resource for producing high-resolution (0. 05 °) global precipitation climatologies that perform reasonably well in data-sparse regions. Traditionally, global climatologies have been produced by combining station observations and physiographic predictors like latitude, longitude, elevation, and slope. While such approaches can work well, especially in areas with reasonably dense observation networks, the fundamental relationship between physiographic variables and the target climate variables can often be indirect and spatially complex. Infrared and microwave satellite observations, on the other hand, directly monitor the earth's energy emissions. These emissions often correspond physically with the location and intensity of precipitation. We show that these relationships provide a good basis for building global climatologies. We also introduce a new geospatial modeling approach based on moving window regressions and inverse distance weighting interpolation. This approach combines satellite fields, gridded physiographic indicators, and in situ climate normals. The resulting global 0. 05 ° monthly precipitation climatology, the Climate Hazards Group's Precipitation Climatology version 1 (CHPclim v. 1. 0, doi: 10. 15780 /G 2159 X), is shown to compare favorably with similar global climatology products, especially in areas with complex terrain and low station densities...|$|R

However, the country continues to battle with poor anthropometric status of children (stunting, wasting and underweight). The country also faces high incidences of food insecurity. It is estimated that {{one third of the}} country’s population is <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>insecure,</b> with about 10 million of Kenyans suffering from chronic food insecurity (ROK, 2011). The worst affected are children, who are deprived of sufficient nutrients required for proper growth and development. This study seeks to analyse the relationship between household food security and the anthropometric status of children. Specific objectives include identifying the prevalence and predictors of poor anthropometry, identifying the extent of food insecurity in the country and investigating the link between food security and the anthropometric status of children. The research uses data from the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (2005 / 2006). The survey which was carried out for a period of 12 months covered the entire country and collected data on the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the households. It also collected data on child anthropometric measurements and households’ food consumption patterns. The statistical software package STATA SE v. 12 is used to run ordinary linear (OLS) and logistical regressions in order to analyse the relationship between household food security and the anthropometric status of children. Results show that the prevalence of malnutrition is high in the country with stunting coming out as the main form of malnutrition. Dietary diversity, a measure of food security, is found to be highest in the urban areas. Results from the regression analysis show that a Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) is positively associated with better anthropometry, with the prevalence of malnutrition decreasing with an increase in the score. The study also found that other risk factors associated with poor anthropometry are age of the child, gender, area of residence, diarrhoea, education, household size and income.

Increased land-use and a higher amount of built areas in and around the city of Buenos Aires leads to losses in ecosystem services. Argentina’s economic situation has also led to an <b>insecure</b> <b>food</b> market, especially affecting the poor population. Apart from providing food security, urban agriculture connect people and can help {{to create a sense of}} community. Urban agriculture also facilitate several ecosystem services. With the growth of dense urban structures, loss of ecosystem services and need for food security, urban agriculture could play an important role for a future sustainable development. Based on this, we were interested in urban agriculture and its chances to strengthen the adaptive capacity and resilience in Buenos Aires. The aim with this project is to map ecosystem services at urban agricultural sites in Buenos Aires. Therefore, the objective is to study literature on urban agriculture, ecosystem services and Argentina and to conduct a field study to map ecosystem services in Buenos Aires. The objective is also to create a matrix to give an overview of the findings on the sites. The field study consist of six case studies on urban agricultural sites in Buenos Aires, where ecosystem services are mapped at a small scale. The study was conducted in November and December 2015 as a Minor Field Study, realized by a stipend from SIDA. A theoretical framework on ecosystem services and research on urban agriculture, as well as a background study on Argentina, serve as a foundation for the empirical study. Our mapping of ecosystem services on sites and research show that urban agriculture provide many ecosystem services. Urban agriculture create a sense of community and other social values.

40|$|Dietary {{diversity}} is {{an indicator of}} the access dimensions of household food security as it relates to income, area, and seasonality. Dietary diversity refers to the number of different individual food items (food variety) and food groups (food group variety) consumed over a given reference period (Ruel, 2002 : 3). This may accurately predict individual nutrient adequacy and thus household food security. Inability to access enough food for a sustainable and healthy life indicates food insecurity. Food accessing refers to obtaining food for all household members at all times through own production, exchange and/or purchase. Food access depends on an adequate, stable, local food supply, and includes the availability and utilization of food (Steyn, Labadarios&Huskissom, 1999 : 32). Lack of food resources often leads to food insecurity due to, among other, limited dietary diversity (different foods items or food groups) (Bellamy, 1998 : 24). Emphasis on dietary diversity can eliminate nutrient deficiency by increasing individual food and food group variety, thereby improving health. The aim of this research is to identify and describe the contribution of food access strategies to dietary diversity of farm worker households by identifying their dietary diversity level and its contribution to household food security. A cross-sectional research design was used to collect data from all the adult women (18 - 65 years) (N= 21) responsible for the food in a complete community of farm worker households on a farm (Oranje farm) in the Free-State province of South Africa. A structured questionnaire was used to gather data on demographics, food access strategies with special reference to food production, purchasing, bartering, gathering and payment in kind, as well as dietary diversity. The two most common food accessing strategies used were purchasing (general dealers) and gathering (wild leaves, hunting, and fishing). Most people depended on own food production (86 %) such as the cultivation of vegetables (spinach, green beans, pumpkin, turnip, tomatoes, cabbage) and fruit (apricots, peaches). Food bartering is seldom practiced (19 %) due to customs and lack of knowledge. Food received as payment in kind (maize meal) was common (76 %). The choice method of food access was buying (76 %), gathering (19 %) and producing (4 %). People seldom ate outside their own home (76 %), except children receiving food at school from the school feeding scheme (90 %). Dietary diversity was limited for cereals consisting mainly of maize meal porridge, bread, vegetables such as wild leafy vegetables, tomatoes, onions, and potatoes, fruit (apples), unpasteurised milk, protein (eggs, chicken) and other (tea, sugar, oil, curry powder). The mean for the food variety score of the 109 food items per day varied from 23. 0 to 27. 9 between five seasons which relates to three to four different food items per day. Food variety score were thus lower in all the seasons when considering nutritious food. The food group diversity score was also calculated over nine nutritious food groups used over seven days. The food group diversity scores was high in almost all the seasons. The mean food group diversity score of the nine food groups varied from 7. 9 to 8. 8 between five seasons which relates to one and almost two food groups per day. Although most food groups were consumed in seven days, resulting in “high” dietary diversity, the numbers of food items (individual food variety) eaten within the various food groups was low. This study showed {{that it was possible to}} predict household food security of household members by simply calculating the food variety score and food group diversity score of a household as an indication of dietary diversity. The result revealed which households was <b>food</b> secure on <b>insecure,</b> and provided an overall picture of the dietary diversity of the whole community. Overall this results indicated that limited food access strategies were utilized or that many of the strategies were not used optimally, resulting in limited dietary diversity, ultimately affecting the household food security status of farm worker households. This information can be used to formulate strategies and develop interventions to increase the number of food access strategies utilized and to food improve utilization thereof in order to improve dietary diversity and household security.

This is an increase from the estimated 11 percent (2.6 million people) deemed to be extremely poor in WFP’s first survey in September 2004. The May 2006 survey also indicated that a further 8.3 million people would be rendered <b>food</b> <b>insecure</b> if they were not provided with a PDS ration, compared to 3.6 million people in the previous survey. [...] An earlier survey, conducted in July 2005, found that acute malnutrition rates for children was nine percent overall, but with rates for children between 6 and 12 months old reaching 13 percent and 12 percent for those aged between one and two years.|$|E
2500|$|Depletion of {{aquifers}} without building upstream dams as {{a sustainable}} alternative water source could precipitate a Malthusian catastrophe in India's <b>food</b> <b>insecure</b> states Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with over 300 million combined population. [...] With India already experiencing a Naxalite–Maoist insurgency in Bihar, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh, Nepalese reluctance {{to agree to}} water projects could even seem an existential threat to India.|$|E
2500|$|... 89 {{percent of}} the American {{households}} were food secure throughout the entire year of 2002, meaning that they had access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life {{for all of the}} household members. The remaining households were <b>food</b> <b>insecure</b> at least some time during that year. The prevalence of food insecurity rose from 10.7% in 2001 to 11.1% in 2002, and the prevalence of food insecurity with hunger rose from 3.3% to 3.5%.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the WFP {{continues}} to provide emergency food provisions to about 1.1 million Iraqis. [...] WFP has {{assisted in the}} establishment of a Food Security Unit, located in the Iraq Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation, which collects food security information. [...] The PDS is still a major contributor in stabilizing the food supply in Iraq. For the poor and <b>food</b> <b>insecure,</b> the PDS represents by far the single most important food source in their diet.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, 16.1 million American {{children}} {{were living in}} poverty. Outside of the 49 million Americans living in <b>food</b> <b>insecure</b> homes, 15.9 million of them were children. In 2013, child poverty reached record high levels in the U.S., with 16.7 million children living in <b>food</b> <b>insecure</b> households. Many of the neighborhoods these children live in lack basic produce and nutritious food. 47 million Americans depend on food banks, more than 30% above 2007 levels. Households headed by single mothers {{are most likely to}} be affected. 30 percent of low-income single mothers cannot afford diapers. Inability to afford this necessity can cause a chain reaction, including mental, health, and behavioral problems. Some women are forced to make use of one or two diapers, using them more than once. This causes rashes and sanitation problems as well as health problems. Without diapers, children are unable to enter into daycare. The lack of childcare can be detrimental to single mothers, hindering their ability to obtain employment. [...] Worst affected are Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, Florida, and the District of Columbia, while North Dakota, New Hampshire, Virginia, Minnesota and Massachusetts are the least affected. 31 million low-income children received free or reduced-price meals daily through the National School lunch program during the 2012 federal fiscal year. Nearly 14 million children are estimated to be served by Feeding America with over 3 million being of the ages of 5 and under.|$|E
2500|$|Although many whites {{had left}} Zimbabwe after independence, mainly for {{neighbouring}} South Africa, {{those who remained}} continued to wield disproportionate control of some sectors of the economy, especially agriculture. In the late-1990s whites accounted for less than 1% of the population but owned 70% of arable land. Mugabe raised this issue of land ownership by white farmers. In a calculated move, he began forcible land redistribution, which brought the government into headlong conflict with the International Monetary Fund. Amid a severe drought in the region, the police and military were instructed not to stop the invasion of white-owned farms by the so-called 'war veterans' and youth militia. This {{has led to a}} mass migration of White Zimbabweans out of Zimbabwe. At present almost no arable land is in the possession of white farmers; the country has also experienced a debilitating food shortage with the exodus of its White minority, turning the [...] "breadbasket of Africa" [...] into one of Africa's most <b>food</b> <b>insecure</b> states.|$|E
