500|$|In late April 2011, Grace Potter {{from the}} American rock band Grace Potter and the Nocturnals sang a rootsy {{acoustic}} rendition of [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] along with strategic handclaps and drummer Matthew Burr's backbeat. Potter said that choosing to cover [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] was easy {{because she is}} [...] "big-voiced". She elaborated: [...] "As I was watching the video, I was watching for the visual candy. Then <b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> began {{falling in love with}} the song." [...] Jessica Letkemann of Billboard magazine complimented the cover, writing: [...] " [...] may usually rock with a 60s feel while Texas-born Beyoncé is a queen of R, but one thing the two women undoubtedly have in common is an amazing set of pipes." ...|$|E

For a moment I froze {{in front of the}} computer, {{thinking}} about writing a letter of complaint to the company for sending us the wrong font. After a while I checked the Bembo Italic and <b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> began to realise that the fonts were Bembo. I calmed down enough to recall that the typeface was originally designed for metal type, and most of the specimens and texts I saw were set in metal type in text size. That was why the images of the characters did not overlap. I knew that a metal typeface was cut or designed separately for each size, but a film composition or digital face is a kind of compromise having proportions designed for reduction and enlargement. I was overwhelmed to see the huge gap. Then I looked into the types used in Western offset-litho prints to see the digital Bembo types in use... the types that were originally designed for hot-metal often looked too light and feeble... Bembo Book is more or less what I expected." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kidman {{attended}} Lane Cove Public School and North Sydney Girls' High School. She {{was enrolled}} in ballet at three and showed her natural talent for acting in her primary and high school years. She says that she was first inspired to become an actress upon seeing Margaret Hamilton's performance as the Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz. Kidman has revealed that she was timid as a child, saying, [...] "I am very shy– really shy– I even had a stutter as a kid, which <b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> got over, but I still regress into that shyness. So I don't like walking into a crowded restaurant by myself; I don't like going to a party by myself." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{was leaning}} back in my chair, with a {{satisfied}} soul, and nibbling at some raisins, while <b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> drank my coffee, when the outer door opened, and Uncle Chipperton entered.|$|E

60|$|I did {{not reply}} at once. I cannot wrap up the deeper {{emotions}} {{and put them back}} on their shelf directly I have no further immediate use for them. <b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> adjusted myself to the new key of the conversation.|$|E
60|$|We got rather {{near him}} this time, as he turned, facing us, and slowly swam in the {{direction}} of my bait. I could see the barracuda shining astern. Dan stopped the boat. <b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> let out line. The swordfish drifted back, and then sank.|$|E
60|$|While <b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> manoeuvered {{in front}} of the lion, Emett slipped behind the rock, lunged for the long tail and got a good hold of it. Then with a whoop he ran around the rock, {{carrying}} the kicking, squalling lion clear of the ground.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> turned <b>slowly</b> away. The {{hall porter}} {{followed}} me. He was drawing something from his waistcoat pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're right," [...] <b>I</b> said <b>slowly.</b> [...] "I shall {{let this}} thing rest. But the photographs, Jack--the apparatus--the affair of the inquest?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> came <b>slowly</b> {{back to the}} table, {{and stood}} facing her across it. She {{looking up at me}} with very piteous eyes.|$|R
60|$|She sighed, {{and looked}} {{towards the door}} of Felicia's room. Then she fluttered away down the corridor, and <b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> retraced my steps. Felicia {{came out in a}} few minutes and sat by her uncle's side. The others had all departed, and we were left alone.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> {{walked toward}} the tramp-tree, {{revolving}} various matters in my mind. We had not spent much money on the place during the winter, and we now had a small sum which we intended to use for {{the advantage of the}} farm, but had not yet decided what to do with it. It behooved me to be careful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ganymede," [...] said <b>I</b> <b>slowly,</b> [...] "when {{we return}} to Paris--if you do not die of fright 'twixt this and then--I'll {{find a place for}} you in the kitchens. God send you may make a better scullion than a follower!" [...] Then, {{vaulting}} over the wall, [...] "Attend me, some half-dozen of you," [...] I commanded, and stepped out briskly towards the barn.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] <b>I</b> said <b>slowly.</b> [...] "You {{had made}} me, as people say, {{in love with}} you.... I don't know--if you {{remember}} everything...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] <b>I</b> {{answered}} <b>slowly,</b> {{after the}} manner of one who deliberates, [...] "if you are persuaded that your conclusions touching Bardelys are correct." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jane," [...] <b>I</b> said <b>slowly,</b> hardly {{liking to}} frame the words, [...] "there's {{something}} strange about this room. He wasn't cruel to me, was he?" ...|$|R
60|$|As {{his heavy}} boots thumped {{on the ladder}} they jarred the whole cabin. My very desperation filled me with the fierceness of a cornered animal. I caught sight of a short branch of the {{thickness}} of a man's arm, and, grasping it, <b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> raised myself. When Bud's black, round head appeared above the loft I hit it with all my might.|$|E
60|$|But I mustn't {{dwell on}} the days that followed--the long quiet days of lazy dreaming on the raft, during which <b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> built up my strength, which had been {{shattered}} by privation. They were days, dear reader, of deep and quiet peace, and yet I cannot recall them without shedding a tear for the brave man who made them what they were.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{unfolding}} {{the last}} {{writing of the}} poor fellow whom the Indians had styled Weeum the Good, <b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> translated it into the Indian language. It {{was not an easy}} task; for, besides feeling that it stirred the heart of the listener with powerful emotions, I had great difficulty in taking my eyes off her changeful face, so as to read the manuscript.|$|E
6000|$|... "I trust so," [...] <b>I</b> {{answered}} <b>slowly,</b> as <b>I</b> {{watched the}} frown deepen {{on the old}} man's face. I dreaded the next question, which came promptly: ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{waited a}} second. [...] "No," [...] <b>I</b> answered, <b>slowly.</b> [...] "I {{have not been}} practising of late. I am looking about me. I travel for enjoyment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your pulse is {{weak and}} very rapid," [...] <b>I</b> said <b>slowly,</b> in a {{professional}} tone. [...] "You {{seem to me to}} have fallen into a perilous condition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One by one <b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> {{opened the}} folds of the letter; feeling, while I did so, the strangest incapability of fixing my {{attention}} on the very lines that I was burning to read. But why dwell any longer on sensations which I can't describe? It will be more to the purpose if I place the letter itself, for future reference, on this page of my journal.|$|E
60|$|I {{would have}} asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon me. <b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> descended. For nearly three months, I had never been called to Mrs. Reed's presence; {{restricted}} so long to the nursery, the breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on which it dismayed me to intrude.|$|E
6000|$|Doubtless she {{had climbed}} up {{the stern of the}} boat and had descended into the depths of the wreck to rescue her beloved book, the reading of which had so long been {{interrupted}} by my harsh decrees. Could I break in on this one hour of rapture? I had not the heart to do it, and as <b>I</b> <b>slowly</b> moved away, there came to me the last words that I ever heard from Rudder Grange: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> came <b>slowly</b> {{back and}} stood by my table. She was sitting with her hands clasped together, looking into the fire. She looked very girlish and frail.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was another}} long silence. [...] "So {{that is how}} we stand," [...] I said {{with an air of}} having things defined. <b>I</b> walked <b>slowly</b> to the door.|$|R
60|$|And as <b>I</b> read, <b>slowly</b> my long-cherished anger evaporated, and {{the real}} Mary, outspoken and simple, whom I had {{obscured}} by a cloud of fancied infidelities, returned to me....|$|R
