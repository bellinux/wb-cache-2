25|$|The inner {{elements}} of a microphone are {{the primary source of}} differences in directivity. A pressure microphone uses a diaphragm between a fixed internal volume of air and the environment, and responds uniformly to pressure from all directions, so it is said to be omnidirectional. A pressure-gradient microphone uses a diaphragm that is at least partially open on both sides. The pressure difference between the two sides produces its directional characteristics. Other elements such as the external shape of the microphone and external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone's <b>directional</b> <b>response.</b> A pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to sounds arriving from front or back, but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the two. The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar patterns are derived by creating a capsule that combines these two effects in different ways. The cardioid, for instance, features a partially closed backside, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics.|$|E

50|$|In {{cognitive}} psychology, the Eriksen Flanker Task {{is a set}} {{of response}} inhibition tests used to assess the ability to suppress responses that are inappropriate in a particular context. The target is flanked by non-target stimuli which correspond either to the same <b>directional</b> <b>response</b> as the target (congruent flankers), to the opposite response (incongruent flankers), or to neither (neutral flankers). The task is named for Barbara. A. Eriksen & Charles W. Eriksen, who first published the task in 1974, and also for the flanker stimuli that surround the target. In the tests, a <b>directional</b> <b>response</b> (usually left or right) is assigned to a central target stimulus. Various forms of the task are used to measure information processing and selective attention.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} directionally {{selective}} (DS) retinal ganglion cells to respond selectively to stimulus motion {{in one direction}} is a classic unresolved example of computation in a local neural circuit. Recent evidence indicates that DS responses occur first in the retina in the dendrites of starburst amacrine cells (interneurons presynaptic to the ganglion cells). We report that the <b>directional</b> <b>responses</b> of starburst-cell dendrites and DS ganglion cells are highly sensitive to the polarity of the transmembrane chloride gradient. Reducing the transmembrane chloride gradient by ion substitution or by blocking the K–Cl cotransporter resulted in the starburst cells responding equally to light moving in opposite directions. Conversely, increasing the chloride gradient by blocking the Na–K–Cl cotransporter eliminated responses to light moving in either direction. Moreover, in each case, blocking the chloride cotransporters or reducing the transmembrane chloride gradient eliminated the <b>directional</b> <b>responses</b> of DS ganglion cells in a manner opposite that of the starburst cells. These results indicate that chloride cotransporters {{play a key role}} in the generation of direction selectivity and that the <b>directional</b> <b>responses</b> of starburst cells and DS ganglion cells are exquisitely sensitive to the chloride equilibrium potential. The findings further suggest that the <b>directional</b> <b>responses</b> of DS ganglion cells are mediated in part by the directional release of γ-aminobutyric acid from starburst dendrites and that the asymmetric distribution of the two cotransporters along starburst-cell dendrites mediates direction selectivity. A model of direction selectivity in the retina that incorporates these and other findings is discussed...|$|R

50|$|Chemorepulsion {{is enabled}} {{by the same}} gradient-sensing {{capability}} that governs chemotaxis. The gradient signal of the chemokinetic agent is received through specific receptors on the cell surface and is transduced through intracellular machinery to generate the <b>directional</b> <b>response.</b> The cell moves up a gradient of a chemoattractant or down a gradient of a chemorepellent. In addition to axon growth cones, the model organism Dictyostelium discoideum {{has been instrumental in}} determining the mechanisms that mediate chemorepulsion and immunorepulsion. The mechanisms of gradient-sensing and cell polarization in D. discoideum are remarkably conserved in human neutrophils.|$|E
5000|$|In {{replication}} of the deflector loft experiments, similar findings were produced, though when anosmic pigeons where employed, they displayed {{the same degree}} of error in orientation as had previously been observed. Therefore, suggesting that the detection of odours may not have been associated with the defector loft effect. Indeed, the flight directions could simply reflect a <b>directional</b> <b>response</b> to wind experienced in the loft or by “other non-odorous factors”, such as light reflection. [...] Researchers support these suggestions by noting the lack of highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions in seed-eating birds such as pigeons. It could be argued, therefore, that pigeons are not dominated by olfactory landmarks when constructing a navigatory map.|$|E

Yet boat noise, {{which can cause}} stress and avoidance behaviour, and may cause masking via reduction of perceptual space, is common around coral islands and continental shelf habitats due to boat activity associated with fishing, tourism and transport of passengers and cargo. In a choice chamber experiment with settlement-stage coral reef fish larvae of the species Apogon doryssa, the <b>directional</b> <b>responses</b> of larvae were tested to 5 different noise types: Reef, Reef+Boat, Ocean, Ocean+Boat and White noise.

Significant <b>directional</b> <b>responses</b> were not observed during White noise, Ocean noise or Ocean+Boat noise playback.

50|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown the ocelli of some insects (most notably the dragonfly, but also some wasps) are capable of form vision, as the ocellar lens forms an image within, or close to, the {{photoreceptor}} layer. In dragonflies it has been demonstrated that the receptive fields of both the photoreceptors and the second-order neurons can be quite restricted. Further research has demonstrated these eyes not only resolve spatial details of the world, but also perceive motion. Second-order neurons in the dragonfly median ocellus respond more strongly to upwards-moving bars and gratings than to downwards-moving bars and gratings, but this effect is only present when ultraviolet light {{is used in the}} stimulus; when ultraviolet light is absent, no <b>directional</b> <b>response</b> is observed.

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} {{discusses}} several {{investigations of the}} peripheral neural code for the directional axis of acoustical particle motion in the saccule of two fishes: goldfish (Carassius auratus) and toadfish (Opsanus tau). Most saccular afferents are directional {{in the manner of}} hair cells, having a cosine-shaped <b>directional</b> <b>response</b> pattern. The saccular sensory epithelia are orientated almost vertically in a parasagittal plane. In the horizontal plane, these epithelia are orientated obliquely with respect to the midline. Hair-cell stereocilia project perpendicularly. Thus, <b>directional</b> <b>response</b> patterns of saccular afferents tend to be orientated in azimuth parallel to the orientation of the epithelia in the head. The oblique angle of the toadfish saccule is greater than that of the goldfish, and the range of best directions in the horizontal plane for each species reflects those differing orientations. The azimuth of acoustical particle motion could be computed by comparing the relative activation of the two saccules, as is the case for the ears of most terrestrial vertebrates. The spatial patterns of saccular hair-cell orientation of most fishes thus appear to have little function in azimuthal source location, but for toadfish are probably most important for determining the elevation of monopole sources...|$|E

As the input fingerprint image is not uniformly illuminated so we have used the bandpass filter for the elimination of non-uniform illumination and for the creation of frequency ridge image before giving it to DDFB. The final enhanced result is constructed on a block-by-block basis by comparing energy of all the directional images and picking one that provides maximum energy. ...|$|R
