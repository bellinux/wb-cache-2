25|$|In Pittsburgh, <b>jitney</b> {{refers to}} an {{unlicensed}} taxi. They are plentiful in low-income communities where regular taxi service is scarce. As enforcement is lax, <b>jitney</b> drivers have even created cooperatives to support {{each other and to}} establish <b>jitney</b> stands. They are known to gather at the parking lots of grocery stores in low-income communities. Some <b>jitney</b> drivers accept requests for service by phone from their regular customers.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} whether to legalize jitneys has been {{considered}} several times by Pennsylvania's Public Utilitiy Commission since at least 1975. The thinking behind the proposal is that jitneys often service areas regular Yellow Cab drivers will not go, thus picking up slack in transportation needs. Famed Pittsburgh playwright August Wilson wrote a play called <b>Jitney,</b> {{which was published in}} 1982.|$|E

The village should study the possibility of establishing a <b>jitney</b> or shuttle bus service that would not only allow visitors to bypass the steep climb up Main Street from the waterfront to downtown but continue westward to the residential areas of the village and town. Other measures to enhance the connection include signage, improved walkways and lighting, and leaving space for river views.|$|E
2500|$|Transportation – All {{private cars}} would {{be banned from}} Manhattan Island. [...] Buses and taxicabs would be permitted, {{with the number of}} cabs increased. [...] Parking lots would be built outside Manhattan at {{strategic}} locations. [...] A monorail, built around the circumference of Manhattan, would service these lots, stopping also at rail stations and water ferry terminals. [...] A free bus and <b>jitney</b> service would operate in Midtown, the city's most congested area. [...] Publicly owned bicycles would be available to all at no cost.|$|E
2500|$|One {{criticism}} of the LIRR {{is that it has}} not improved service to the [...] "east end" [...] of Long Island as the twin forks continue to grow in popularity as a year-round tourist and residential destination. Demand is evidenced by flourishing for-profit bus services such as the Hampton <b>Jitney</b> and the Hampton Luxury Liner and the early formative stages of a new East End Transportation Authority. Local politicians have joined the public outcry for the LIRR to either improve the frequency of east end services, or turn the operation over to a local transportation authority.|$|E

2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{tourists}} to the 1863 Gettysburg Battlefield typically arrived at the borough by train and paid fees for horse-drawn <b>jitney</b> taxis to travel over the battlefield on primitive wagon roads of the private Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association. [...] The GBMA owned less than [...] of the battlefield's much larger area, and nearly all military engagement areas were privately owned and had twelve small GBMA-owned monument plots of [...] [...] Some owners rented land for camping, sold souvenirs/refreshments, and by 1894 required top dollar prices for real estate purchases. [...] Similarly, the original battlefield roads had fallen into disrepair after the GBMA funds had become nearly exhausted by late 1882. [...] Despite the preceding 1884 Round Top Branch steamtrain railroad that operated across the field of Pickett's Charge and Hancock Avenue to Round Top Station, an 1892 meeting next-door at the Round Top School formed an opposition committee of Cumberland Township voters (William H. Tipton was the only attendee favoring the trolley, and the township subsequently granted road right-of-way.) ...|$|E

50|$|Many <b>jitneys,</b> {{including}} some of those owned by Spanish Transportation, use local streets {{in the vicinity of}} the PABT, namely 42nd Street, as a drop-off and pick-up point for passengers and parking, which has led to congestion and complaints.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} her that he drove rather too carefully, too slowly. He took curves and corners evenly. His face was as empty of expression, as unmelodramatic, as that of a <b>jitney</b> driver.

6000|$|Again he risked the scorn of {{conductors}} and <b>jitney</b> drivers. He found Queen Anne Hill, {{found the}} residence of Mr. Eugene Gilson. He sneaked about it, slipped into the gate, prowled toward the house. Flabby from the intensity of study, he longed for the stimulus of Claire's smile. But as he {{stared up at the}} great squares of the clear windows, at the flare of white columns in the porch-lights, that smile seemed unreachable. He felt like a rustic at court. From the shelter of the prickly holly hedge he watched the house. It was [...] "some kind of a party?--or what would folks like these call a party?" [...] Limousines were arriving; he had a glimpse of silken ankles, frothy underskirts; heard easy laughter; saw people moving through a big blue and silver room; caught a drifting tremor of music.|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh!" [...] he growled. [...] "Quite {{some folks}} living here. Don't suppose they spend such a whale {{of a lot}} of time {{thinking}} about Milt Daggett and Bill McGolwey and Prof Jones. I guess most of these people wouldn't think Heinie Rauskukle's store was so gosh-awful big. I wasn't scared of Minneapolis--much--but there they didn't ring in mountains and an ocean on you. And I didn't have to go up on the hill and meet folks like Claire's relations, and figure out whether you shake hands catch-as-catch-can or Corinthian. Look at that sawmill chimney--isn't it nice of 'em to put the fly-screen over it so the flies won't get down into the flames. No, they haven't got much more than a million feet of lumber in that one pile. And here's a bum little furniture store--it wouldn't cost more 'n about ten times all I've got to buy one of those Morris chairs. Oh Gooooooosh, won't these houses ever stop? Say, that must be a <b>jitney.</b> The driver snickered at me. Will the whole town be onto me? Milt, you're a kind young fellow, and you know what's the matter with Heinie's differential, but they don't need you here. Quite a few folks to carry on the business. Gosh, look at that building ahead--nine stories!" ...|$|E
