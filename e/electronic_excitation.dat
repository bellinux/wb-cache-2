40|$|The cluster {{expansion}} method {{is applied to}} <b>electronic</b> <b>excitations</b> {{and a set of}} effective cluster density of states (ECDOS) are defined, analogous to effective cluster interactions (ECI). The ECDOS are used to generate alloy thermodynamic properties as well as equation of state (EOS) of <b>electronic</b> <b>excitations</b> for the fcc Ni-Al systems. When parent clusters with small size, the convergence of the expansion is not so good but the electronic density of state (DOS) is well reproduced. However, the integrals of the DOS such as the cluster expanded free energy, entropy and internal energy associated with <b>electronic</b> <b>excitations</b> are well described {{at the level of the}} tetrahedron-octahedron cluster approximation, indicating the ECDOS is applicable to produce electronic ECI for cluster variation method or Monte Carlo calculations. On the other hand, the Gruneisen parameter, calculated with first-principles methods, is not any longer a constant and implies that the whole DOS profile should be considered for EOS of <b>electronic</b> <b>excitations,</b> where ECDOS adapts very well for disordered alloys and solid solutions.

25|$|Pope's group {{reported}} in 1965 {{that in the}} absence of an external electric field, the electroluminescence in anthracene crystals is caused by the recombination of a thermalized electron and hole, and that the conducting level of anthracene is higher in energy than the exciton energy level. Also in 1965, W. Helfrich and W. G. Schneider of the National Research Council in Canada produced double injection recombination electroluminescence for the first time in an anthracene single crystal using hole and electron injecting electrodes, the forerunner of modern double-injection devices. In the same year, Dow Chemical researchers patented a method of preparing electroluminescent cells using high-voltage (500–1500 V) AC-driven (100–3000Hz) electrically insulated one millimetre thin layers of a melted phosphor consisting of ground anthracene powder, tetracene, and graphite powder.

2500|$|Each {{one of the}} {{assumptions}} listed below adds {{to the complexity of}} the problem's solution. As the density of a gas increases with rising pressure, the intermolecular forces play a more substantial role in gas behavior which results in the ideal gas law no longer providing [...] "reasonable" [...] results. At {{the upper end of the}} engine temperature ranges (e.g. combustor sections – 1300 K), the complex fuel particles absorb internal energy by means of rotations and vibrations that cause their specific heats to vary from those of diatomic molecules and noble gases. At more than double that temperature, <b>electronic</b> <b>excitation</b> and dissociation of the gas particles begins to occur causing the pressure to adjust to a greater number of particles (transition from gas to plasma). Finally, all of the thermodynamic processes were presumed to describe uniform gases whose velocities varied according to a fixed distribution. Using a non-equilibrium situation implies the flow field must be characterized in some manner to enable a solution. One of the first attempts to expand the boundaries of the ideal gas law was to include coverage for different thermodynamic processes by adjusting the equation to read pVn = constant and then varying the n through different values such as the specific heat ratio, γ.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the quantum}} {{mechanical}} picture, the vibrational levels and vibrational wavefunctions {{are those of}} quantum harmonic oscillators, or of more complex approximations to the potential energy of molecules, such as the Morse potential. Figure 1 illustrates the Franck–Condon principle for vibronic transitions in a molecule with Morse-like potential energy functions in both the ground and excited electronic states. In the low temperature approximation, the molecule starts out in the v = 0 vibrational level of the ground electronic state and upon absorbing a photon of the necessary energy, makes a transition to the excited electronic state. The electron configuration of the new state {{may result in a}} shift of the equilibrium position of the nuclei constituting the molecule. In the figure this shift in nuclear coordinates between the ground and the first excited state is labeled as q 01. In the simplest case of a diatomic molecule the nuclear coordinates axis refers to the internuclear separation. The vibronic transition is indicated by a vertical arrow due to the assumption of constant nuclear coordinates during the transition. The probability that the molecule can end up in any particular vibrational level is proportional to the square of the (vertical) overlap of the vibrational wavefunctions of the original and final state (see Quantum mechanical formulation section below). In the electronic excited state molecules quickly relax to the lowest vibrational level of the lowest <b>electronic</b> <b>excitation</b> state (Kasha's rule), and from there can decay to the [...] electronic ground state via photon emission. The Franck–Condon principle is applied equally to absorption and to fluorescence.|$|E
