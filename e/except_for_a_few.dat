5|$|For {{almost all}} of its long history, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> brief periods, Paris was governed {{directly}} by representatives of the king, emperor, or president of France. The city was not granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly until 1974. The first modern elected mayor of Paris was Jacques Chirac, elected 20 March 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1793. The current mayor is Anne Hidalgo, a socialist, elected 5 April 2014.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} {{operational}} existence, {{the brigade}} remained in Reserve status <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> brief mobilizations in the Active Duty force. It was ordered into active military service on 24 March 1970 at Fort Tilden, New York, before being reverted to reserve status two days later. The brigade received its distinctive unit insignia on 28 January 1971 and its shoulder sleeve insignia on 20 December 1973.

5|$|In 1962, Gygax {{got a job}} as an {{insurance}} underwriter at Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. His family continued to grow, and after his third child was born, he decided to move his family back to Lake Geneva. <b>Except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months he would spend in Clinton, Wisconsin, following his divorce, and his time in Hollywood while he was the head of TSR's entertainment division, Lake Geneva would be his home {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Frederick {{realized}} the gambit by 2:30 pm. By 3:00pm, the entire Prussian army had struck camp, loaded their tents and gear, and fallen into line. Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz took his 38 squadrons of cavalry {{and moved toward}} the Janus and Pölzen, small hills between Rossbach and Reichertswerben. <b>Except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> moments, the advance was hidden entirely from view. He was followed by Colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller's battery of 18 guns, which positioned themselves temporarily on the reverse of the Janus between the infantry's left and the cavalry's right. Seven squadrons remained in Rossbach to contain Saint-Germain's advanced post.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia kept East Timor {{shut off}} from the rest of the world, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{claiming}} that the vast majority of East Timorese supported integration. This position was followed closely by the Indonesian media such that an East Timorese acceptance of their integration with Indonesia was taken for granted by, and was a non-issue for, the majority of Indonesians. East Timor came to be seen as a training ground for the officer corps in tactics of suppression for Aceh and Papua, and was pivotal in ensuring military sector dominance of Indonesia.|$|E

50|$|Early in {{the history}} of {{compiler}}s, compiler optimizations were not as good as hand-written ones. As compiler technologies have improved, good compilers typically generate code good enough to generally no longer warrant the much higher effort to program hand-optimized code in assembly language (<b>except</b> <b>for</b> in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> special cases).|$|R
5|$|Many half-tracks, jeeps {{and trucks}} foundered in deep water; those {{that made it}} ashore soon became jammed up on the {{narrowing}} beach, making easy targets for the German defenders. Most of the radios were lost, making the task of organizing the scattered and dispirited troops even more difficult, and those command groups that did make the shore found their effectiveness limited to their immediate vicinity. <b>Except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> surviving tanks and a heavy weapons squad here or there, the assault troops had only their personal weapons, which, having been dragged through surf and sand, invariably needed cleaning before they could be used.|$|E
5|$|The {{restoration}} works {{carried out}} on the fort in 1947 involved addition of a powder magazine, removal of dilapidated parts of the bastions and building an additional wooden building for housing {{the office of the}} governor. The governor’s residence on the ramparts of the fort was also renovated. A prison was also built within the fort, which consisted of four rooms. The refurbished fort was now used more as a prison than for defending the Kingdom. The cannons were rusting and the fort was mostly empty of personnel <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> soldiers and the Governor of Maui who lived there.|$|E
5|$|Turner was {{discovered}} in 1936 at the Top Hat Malt Shop in Hollywood, California. At the age of 16, she was signed to a personal contract by Warner Bros. director Mervyn LeRoy, who took her {{with him when he}} moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1938. Turner attracted attention in her first film, LeRoy's They Won't Forget (1937), and she later starred in featured roles, often as an ingenue. Her auburn hair was bleached blonde for a 1939 film at MGM, and she remained blonde {{for the rest of her}} life, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> film roles.|$|E

5|$|As {{a clandestine}} army {{operating}} in an enemy-occupied country, and separated by {{over a thousand}} kilometers from any friendly territory, the Home Army faced unique challenges in acquiring arms and equipment. It was able to overcome these difficulties to some extent and to field {{tens of thousands of}} armed soldiers. Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (<b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> instances during the Warsaw Uprising, such as the Kubuś armored car). Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.|$|E
5|$|During the {{pre-production}} phase, Venkatesh allocated bulk {{dates and}} the film's shoot {{was expected to}} be completed in a single schedule. Principal photography began in the locales of Kerala on 8 March 2014. Filming continued in the Idukki district of Kerala, where the original was primarily shot. The film's spokesperson told IANS that most of the film would be shot in Kerala, at locations similar to the original, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> scenes. Sripriya chose Kerala for two reasons– its greenery, and to avoid local interference from crowds that would ensue if shot in Andhra Pradesh, where Venkatesh is a star. After filming crucial scenes at a few villages near Kochi for more than three weeks, the film's unit shot at Araku and Simhachalam beginning mid April 2014. Subsequently, they planned to continue at Vizianagaram.|$|E
5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months after her father died.|$|E
50|$|In 1396 a high portico (protiro) {{was added}} to the west front, which was rebuilt in 1467. From about 1477 the Ferrarese {{painters}} Francesco del Cossa and Ercole de' Roberti worked in the Garganelli Chapel on the creation of a cycle of frescoes which later had a significant influence on Niccolò dell'Arca and Michelangelo. The frescoes were lost in subsequent reconstruction <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very <b>few</b> fragments.|$|R

5|$|In {{the night}} sky, Betelgeuse {{is easy to}} spot {{with the naked eye}} owing to its {{distinctive}} orange-red color. In the Northern Hemisphere, beginning in January of each year, it can be seen rising in the east just after sunset. By mid-September to mid-March (best in mid-December), it is visible to virtually every inhabited region of the globe, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> research stations in Antarctica at latitudes south of 82°. In May (moderate northern latitudes) or June (southern latitudes), the red supergiant can be seen briefly on the western horizon after sunset, reappearing again a few months later on the eastern horizon before sunrise. In the intermediate period (June–July) it is invisible to the naked eye (visible only with a telescope in daylight), unless around midday (when the Sun is below horizon) on Antarctic regions between 70° and 80° south latitude.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Children of Mana features a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls a main character, chosen from one of four options. Each of the characters have different ratings from one to five in four areas: the damage they do with magic, the speed that they can attack, {{and the amount of}} health and mana they have. The game plays out nearly identically regardless of which character is chosen, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> quests specific to each character. Unlike previous {{games in the}} series, the main character typically has no companions during the game; however, a cooperative multiplayer option is present for up to four players, who all appear on each player's screens. This multiplayer mode is only present with local WiFi, and progress is only saved on the host player's game.|$|E

500|$|In {{its base}} form, a PIE root {{consists}} of a single vowel, preceded and followed by consonants. <b>Except</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very <b>few</b> cases, the root is fully characterized by its consonants, while the vowel may alternate in accordance with inflection or word derivation. Thus, the root [...] can also appear as , with a long vowel as [...] or , or even unsyllabic as , in different grammatical contexts. This process is called ablaut.|$|R
