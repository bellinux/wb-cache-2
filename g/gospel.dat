5|$|Prior to the {{category}} Best Soul <b>Gospel</b> Performance, Male or Female {{there were two}} categories separated by gender: Best Soul <b>Gospel</b> Performance, Female and Best Soul <b>Gospel</b> Performance, Male. Both awards were presented from 1984 to 1989. The first gender-neutral award was presented in 1990. In 1991, another category restructure resulted in the soul <b>gospel</b> categories being divided into awards for Best Contemporary Soul <b>Gospel</b> Album and Best Traditional <b>Gospel</b> Album (previously known as Best Soul <b>Gospel</b> Performance, Contemporary and Best Soul <b>Gospel</b> Performance, Traditional from 1978 to 1983), both of which lasted until the 53rd Grammy Awards in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} classify the <b>Gospel</b> of the Hebrews {{as one of}} {{the three}} Jewish–Christian gospels, along with the <b>Gospel</b> of the Nazarenes and the <b>Gospel</b> of the Ebionites. Others suggest that these three titles may have been referring to one and the same book. All are known today only from fragments preserved in quotations by the early Church Fathers. The relationship between the Jewish–Christian gospels and a hypothetical original Hebrew <b>Gospel</b> remains a speculation.|$|E
5|$|The Ebionite <b>gospel</b> is {{one example}} of a type of <b>gospel</b> harmony that used the <b>Gospel</b> of Matthew as a base text but did not include the <b>Gospel</b> of John; it is {{believed}} to pre-date Tatian's Diatessaron (c.170) which included all four canonical gospels. The <b>gospel</b> has a parallel to a quotation in a mid-2nd-century homily known as 2 Clement, suggesting that both may be dependent on a harmonizing tradition from an earlier 2nd century source. The harmonized <b>gospel</b> sayings sources used by Justin Martyr to compose his First Apology and Dialogue with Trypho were similarly based on the Synoptic Gospels. According to scholar George Howard, harmonization was a widely used method of composition in the early Patristic period. Many of the heterodox variants found in the <b>Gospel</b> of the Ebionites may have been adopted from a larger pool of variants that were in circulation; an example is the appearance of a great light that shone during Jesus' Baptism which is also found in the Diatessaron.|$|E
50|$|The Echternach <b>Gospels</b> (Paris, Bib. N., MS. lat. 9389) were produced, presumably, at Lindisfarne Abbey in Northumbria {{around the}} year 690. This {{location}} was very significant {{for the production of}} Insular manuscripts, such as the Durham <b>Gospels</b> (ms. A.II.17) and the Lindisfarne <b>Gospels</b> (ms. Cotton Nero D. IV). The scribe of the Durham <b>Gospels</b> is believed to have created the Echternach <b>Gospels</b> as well. The Echternach <b>Gospels</b> are now in the collection of France’s Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris.|$|R

50|$|On the one hand, some {{scholars}} have maintained that Egerton's unknown author composed by borrowing from the canonical <b>gospels.</b> This solution has not proved satisfactory for several reasons: The Egerton <b>Gospel's</b> parallels to the synoptic <b>gospels</b> lack editorial language peculiar to the synoptic authors, Matthew, Mark, and Luke. They also lack features that are common to the synoptic <b>gospels,</b> a difficult fact to explain if those <b>gospels</b> were Egerton's source.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Gospel</b> of the Hebrews is {{preserved}} in fragments quoted or summarized by various early Church Fathers. The {{full extent of}} the original <b>gospel</b> is unknown; according to a list of canonical and apocryphal works drawn up in the 9th century known as the Stichometry of Nicephorus, the <b>gospel</b> was 2200 lines, just 300 lines shorter than Matthew. Based on the surviving fragments, the overall structure of the <b>gospel</b> appears to have been similar to the canonical ones. It consisted of a narrative of the life of Jesus which included his baptism, temptation, transfiguration, last supper, crucifixion, and resurrection. The <b>gospel</b> also contained sayings of Jesus. The events in the life of Jesus have been interpreted in a way that reflects Jewish ideas present in a Hellenistic cultural environment.|$|E
5|$|The early Church Fathers {{believed}} {{there was only one}} Jewish–Christian <b>gospel,</b> perhaps in different versions; however, scholars have long recognized the possibility there were at least two or three. Jerome's references to a <b>Gospel</b> of the Hebrews, or variants of that name, are particularly problematic because it is unclear which <b>gospel</b> he is referring to as the source of his quotations. Hegesippus, Eusebius, and Jerome all used an Aramaic <b>gospel,</b> which Jerome referred to as the <b>gospel</b> used by a Jewish Christian sect known as the Nazarenes. <b>Gospel</b> of the Nazarenes is the name adopted by scholars to describe the fragments of quotations believed to originate from an Aramaic <b>gospel</b> that was based on traditions similar to the <b>Gospel</b> of Matthew. A third <b>gospel</b> was known only to Epiphanius of Salamis, which he attributed to a second Jewish Christian group known as the Ebionites. Scholars have conventionally referred to seven fragments of a Greek <b>gospel</b> harmony preserved in quotations by Epiphanius as the <b>Gospel</b> of the Ebionites. The existence of three independent Jewish–Christian gospels with distinct characteristics has been regarded as an established consensus. However, that conclusion has recently been challenged with respect to the composition of the <b>gospel</b> known to the Nazarenes and its relationship to the <b>Gospel</b> of the Hebrews. The relationship between the <b>Gospel</b> of the Hebrews and the other Jewish–Christian gospels, as well as a hypothetical original Hebrew <b>Gospel,</b> is uncertain and has been an ongoing subject of scholarly investigation.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the <b>Gospel</b> of the Ebionites, the <b>Gospel</b> of the Hebrews, and the <b>Gospel</b> of the Nazarenes remains unclear. All the Jewish–Christian gospels survive only as fragments in quotations, so {{it is difficult to}} tell if they are independent texts or variations of each other. Scholar Albertus Klijn established the modern consensus, concluding that the <b>gospel</b> harmony composed in Greek appears to be a distinctive text known only to Epiphanius. Scholar Marie-Émile Boismard has claimed the Ebionite <b>gospel</b> is partly dependent upon a hypothetical Hebrew <b>gospel</b> as a source; however this conjecture remains a minority view. Its putative relationship to the <b>gospel</b> text known to Origen as the <b>Gospel</b> of the Twelve remains a subject of scholarly debate.|$|E

5|$|Eusebius {{listed the}} <b>Gospel</b> of the Hebrews in his Antilegomena {{as one of}} the disputed {{writings}} of the early Church. Despite this, the Church Fathers occasionally used it, with reservations, as a source to support their exegetical arguments. Eusebius reports that the 2nd century Church Father Hegesippus used the <b>gospel</b> as a source for writing his Hypomneumata ("Memoranda") in Rome (c.175–180). The Alexandrian Fathers – Clement, Origen, and Didymus the Blind – relied directly on the <b>gospel</b> to provide prooftexts as a supplement to the canonical gospels. Clement quoted from the <b>gospel</b> as part of a discourse on divine Wisdom. Origen used it to compare differing views {{of the relationship between the}} Word and the Holy Spirit. Jerome claimed to have used the <b>gospel</b> as a prooftext, although he may have relied in part on excerpts from the commentaries of Origen. He quoted from it as a proof from prophecy based on Isaiah11.2 to explain how Jesus was the fulfillment of messianic expectations. The <b>Gospel</b> of the Hebrews was excluded from the canon by the Catholic Church with the closing of the New Testament canon at the end of the 4th century, and was no longer cited as a source in Church literature.|$|E

According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent on the question of his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical <b>gospel)</b> showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the <b>Gospel</b> of Thomas, the <b>Gospel</b> of Mary, and the <b>Gospel</b> of Philip.|$|E

5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{who see the}} <b>gospel</b> nativity stories as later apologetic accounts created to establish the Messianic status of Jesus regard the Star of Bethlehem as a pious fiction. Aspects of Matthew's account which have raised questions of the historical event include: Matthew {{is the only one}} of the four gospels which mentions either the Star of Bethlehem or the Magi. In Mark 6:1-4, the author of the <b>Gospel</b> of Mark, considered by modern text scholars to be the oldest of the Gospels, does not appear to be aware of the Bethlehem nativity story.. Scholars suggest that Jesus was born in Nazareth and that the Bethlehem nativity narratives reflect a desire by the <b>Gospel</b> writers to present his birth as the fulfillment of prophecy. The Matthew account conflicts with that given in the <b>Gospel</b> of Luke, in which the family of Jesus already live in Nazareth, travel to Bethlehem for the census, and return home almost immediately.|$|E
