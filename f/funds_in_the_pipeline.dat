The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), that had almost shelved the plan, is on a rethink mode with additional <b>funding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although the FFC <b>funding</b> was now <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> {{production}} faced {{its most}} serious challenge when, on 11 November 1990, Ted Albert died suddenly {{from a heart}} attack (the film is dedicated to him). This threw the entire project into doubt, but Ted Albert's widow Popsy decided that it should go to completion in honour of her husband, so she took over as executive producer, with Miall as producer. With her blessing, Ted's family company Albert Music invested AUD 1 million, with the remaining AUD 300,000 sourced from private investors. Even after completion, the team were greeted with stiff resistance from exhibitors: Luhrmann recalled that one exhibitor walked out before the film had even finished, declaring that Luhrmann was ruined and that he would never work again.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Finite element {{analysis}} software ANSYS is used {{to establish}} a three-dimensional finite element model of <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> corrosion defects by applying the boundary conditions of square wave excitation to simulate the distributions of current and induced magnetic field <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> under various defect volumes. The {{results of the study}} show: When there is no corrosion defect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> electric current <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> is basically even distribution. The magnetic field is distributed for the symmetrical vortex shape from head to foot, and it has not obviously gather phenomenon. When there are some corrosion defects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline,</b> <b>the</b> electric current forms partial symmetrical vortex shape in both sides of the corrosion defect, and it is obviously assembled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> defect place. The simulation results of the different size defects show that the maximum magnetic field strength and the maximum current value increase with the defect depth increasing, while the output voltage decreases with the defect depth increasing. For the analysis of the stress distributions of <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> corrosion defect with certain size under different pressures, {{it was found that the}} maximum stress is 596 MPa when the bearing limit work pressure of <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> is 7 MPa, which is smaller than the yield strength with ensuring the safely running of <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> with defects...|$|R
