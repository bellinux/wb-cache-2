25|$|When the YOH-4A was {{eliminated}} by the Army, Bell went about {{solving the problem}} of marketing the aircraft. In addition to the <b>image</b> <b>problem,</b> the helicopter lacked cargo space and only provided cramped quarters for the planned three passengers. The solution was a redesigned fuselage, sleeker and aesthetically appealing, adding 16ft3 (0.45m3) of cargo space in the process. A Bell executive contributed to this redesign by drawing on a sketch two lines extending the fuselage to where it meets the tail. The redesign was designated Bell 206A, and Bell President Edwin J. Ducayet named it the JetRanger, denoting an evolution from the popular Model 47J Ranger.|$|E

The participants were to complete a task that asked them to act as a board of directors of a winery with an <b>image</b> <b>problem.</b> They were to find and discuss alternatives, and at the end submit their alternative with rationale. Collocated groups worked at a table together, while distributed groups did the same task at separate computers that allowed for electronic, networked communication. The same technology was used by both collocated and distributed groups.|$|E

Kurt later eavesdrops on the directors and hears them question whether he is masculine enough for the role.

Kurt is also running for class president, and accepts campaign help from Brittany (Heather Morris), who wants to highlight his unique character by comparing him to a unicorn. Kurt feels her proposed campaign materials highlight only his gay side, and is upset when she goes against his wishes and posts them anyway. He discusses his <b>image</b> <b>problem</b> with his father, Burt (Mike O'Malley), who recommends that he embrace his uniqueness. Kurt later changes his mind about his campaign's approach and apologizes to Brittany, but is surprised to learn that she too has decided to run for class president.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to {{the first}} {{generation}} Ridgeline, Honda's second attempt at a mid-size truck for the North American market has the automotive press changing its tune, yet it still has an <b>image</b> <b>problem.</b> [...] Gearheads.org wrote the [...] "2017 Honda Ridgeline still won’t get respect but should" [...] stating, its [...] "downside {{is going to be}} looks" [...] with its [...] "soft rounded pudgy panda look rather than a sharp chiseled warhorse." [...] A New York Daily News reporter said, [...] "You’d think that the most utilitarian of passenger vehicle styles –-the pickup truck-– would be a completely logical purchase. [...] If that were the case, the Ridgeline would outsell all of the other midsize trucks by a landslide, boasting the best combination of safety, utility and drivability in the class. [...] But the Toyota Tacoma and Chevrolet Colorado both have something that the Ridgeline almost completely lacks: ...bravado." [...] That being said, Car and Driver magazine proclaimed, [...] "The Ridgeline’s roomy cabin, ample storage, smooth ride, and innovative touches make its rivals seem outdated. ...it not only has cargo space, but also the makings of a great tailgate party..." [...] Motor Trend magazine summed up their view by says they liked [...] "its smooth ride and sharp handling," [...] disliked [...] "the high price, clumsy infotainment system, and plain design," [...] and nominated the new Ridgeline as one of its finalist for their 2017 Truck of the Year competition.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though no}} mention {{is made of}} the words [...] "Labour", [...] "Conservative" [...] and [...] "Liberal Democrat", it is {{strongly}} implied throughout the four series {{that this is a}} dramatised reflection of real-life political parties and events rather than a parallel universe. Each political party is portrayed in equally unflattering terms, each being shown as inept, accident-prone and generally inefficient, and each having their own unique problems. For instance, the ruling party of the first three seasons, to which Abbot and Murray belong, is portrayed as being hampered by its many warring factions and internal strife, which reflects the real-life factionalism and power struggles within the Labour Party both during and after Tony Blair's leadership and the rise to power of Gordon Brown's faction (roughly identified as the [...] "Nutters" [...] in the series), as well as its pragmatic approach to politics. On the other side, the Opposition party to which Mannion belongs is portrayed as suffering from an <b>image</b> <b>problem,</b> being seen as backward, old-fashioned and unprogressive, and having a relatively young, inexperienced leader running a PR overhaul to broaden the party's appeal – a reference to the then Conservative Party leader David Cameron, whose attention to image in his early years of leadership was often derided both inside and outside his party. Additionally, the smaller coalition party of which Fergus Williams is a member is portrayed as having similar principles to Murray's party, and is widely accused of having betrayed its own principles by entering into a coalition with Mannion's party, referencing similar accusations made against the Liberal Democrats after the 2010 coalition was formed. Most parallels are drawn from personal conversations between characters, rather than actual policies, however – indeed, most of the actual policies that are seen being implemented are quite mundane, and have no political or ideological significance.|$|E

Participants were female university students (N = 143) aged 18 to 21 years old, obtained through purposive sampling. This survey used Likert type scale (2 scales) and a pictorial scale as the research instruments. The data collected were analyzed with descriptive statistics and cross tabulation of demographic questionnaire. The results showed that there was a gap between the desired body perception and the real one. The prominent behavior was compulsive behavior. Body <b>image</b> <b>problems,</b> which comprised of body image dissatisfaction, cognitive distortion, and body image compulsive behavior were also experienced by some young women in normal population even when their body mass index were normal...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{particularly}} interested in the <b>image</b> inpainting <b>problem</b> using directional complex tight wavelet frames. Under the assumption that frame coefficients of images are sparse, several iterative thresholding algorithms for the <b>image</b> inpainting <b>problem</b> have been proposed in the literature. The outputs of such iterative algorithms are closely linked to solutions of several convex minimization models using the balanced approach which simultaneously combines the $l_ 1 $-regularization for sparsity of frame coefficients and the $l_ 2 $-regularization for smoothness of the solution. Due to the redundancy of a tight frame, elements of a tight frame could be highly correlated and therefore, their corresponding frame coefficients of an image are expected to close to each other. This is called the grouping effect in statistics. In this paper, we establish the grouping effect property for frame-based convex minimization models using the balanced approach. This result on grouping effect partially explains the effectiveness of models using the balanced approach for several <b>image</b> restoration <b>problems.</b> Inspired by recent development on directional tensor product complex tight framelets (TP-CTFs) and their impressive performance for the <b>image</b> denoising <b>problem,</b> in this paper we propose an iterative thresholding algorithm using a single tight frame derived from TP-CTFs for the <b>image</b> inpainting <b>problem.</b> Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can handle well both cartoons and textures simultaneously and performs comparably and often better than several well-known frame-based iterative thresholding algorithms for the <b>image</b> inpainting <b>problem</b> without noise. For the <b>image</b> inpainting <b>problem</b> with additive zero-mean i. i. d. Gaussian noise, our proposed algorithm using TP-CTFs performs superior than other known state-of-the-art frame-based image inpainting algorithms...|$|R
