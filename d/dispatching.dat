5|$|In late 1990 {{consideration}} {{was given}} to deploying a squadron of F/A-18s to the Middle East {{as part of an}} expanded Australian contribution to the Gulf War. The Department of Defence opposed <b>dispatching</b> the aircraft on the grounds that doing so would greatly strain the fighter force in Australia, and this option was not adopted by the government. As a result, the Hornets' only role in the war was to support the training of the Royal Australian Navy warships which were sent to the Gulf by conducting mock attacks on the vessels as they sailed from Sydney to Perth.|$|E

However, single <b>dispatch</b> has several limitations. Consequently, {{a growing number of}} programming languages enables a multiple <b>dispatch,</b> where the method to be executed is selected by the dynamic type of all arguments of method call. Here, different multiple <b>dispatch</b> simulation techniques in java programming language, which otherwise supports only single <b>dispatch,</b> are discussed.

50|$|On 28 December 2012, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress {{passed an}} {{amendment}} to the Labour Contract Law. The changes will come into force on 1 July 2013 and mainly affect labour <b>dispatch.</b> The Amendment increases the registration requirements for labour <b>dispatch</b> agencies, improves how <b>dispatched</b> employees are remunerated, clarifies the scope of eligible positions and assigns liabilities to host employers. Labour <b>dispatch</b> is highly relied upon in China to staff companies, both domestic and foreigninvested. Under a typical labour <b>dispatch</b> arrangement, a <b>dispatch</b> agency enters into an employment contract with an employee and then enters into a <b>dispatch</b> agreement with a host employer, pursuant to which the employee is <b>dispatched</b> to the host employer. Under this scheme, the <b>dispatch</b> agency, instead of the host employer, assumes all obligations and liabilities of an employer, such as paying social security contributions and severance for the employees. There have been debates on the use of labour <b>dispatch</b> because it makes it easier for employers to evade liabilities, and thus <b>dispatched</b> employees often have less protection than regular employees. When promulgated in 2007, the Labour Contract Law compromised on this issue by intentionally leaving certain provisions ambiguous and general. As a result, the use of labour <b>dispatch</b> has continued to grow even after the law was introduced. The purpose of the Amendment is to tighten the rules on labour <b>dispatch.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hierarchical <b>dispatch</b> structure for efficient distribution network pricing. The <b>dispatch</b> coordination {{problem in the}} context of hierarchical network operators are addressed. We formulate decentralized generation <b>dispatch</b> into a bilevel optimization problem in which main network operator and the connected distribution network operator optimize their costs in two levels. By using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and Fortuny-Amat McCarl linearization, the bilevel optimization problem is reduced into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Equivalence between proposed hierarchical <b>dispatch</b> and centralized <b>dispatch</b> is proved. The model is solved in GAMS platform. IEEE 14 -bus meshed network and IEEE 13 -node radial network are connected to be an illustrative example offering numerical <b>dispatch</b> results. Three scenarios representing distributed generation (DGs) successive development stages are analyzed. Hierarchical <b>dispatch</b> achieves same results as traditional centralized <b>dispatch</b> in the three considered scenarios. Distribution network nodal prices are obtained. Intrinsic advantages of the proposed hierarchical <b>dispatch</b> are to reduce the <b>dispatch</b> complexity with increasing DGs penetration and provide distribution locational marginal prices (DLMP).
