50|$|IECCs were {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to the traditional switch or button panel control, which in turn replaced mechanical lever frames. From the start, they controlled Solid State Interlockings (SSIs), a software version of the traditional <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking,</b> but existing <b>relay</b> interlockings may also be controlled from an IECC. The system can control as many miles of track as required, but typically around 50-100 miles.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose is}} to {{interpret}} train-lined commands and configure the traction equipment to receive or generate high-voltage power {{in order to move}} or slow the vehicle, and to regulate the effort provided to the level commanded. Equipment Type The primary equipment associated with the propulsion system is the traction motor. The most common traction motor is a compound wound-direct current motor with series and shuntwound fields. There are separately excited dc motors. Newer vehicle orders are tending toward ac induction motors. A coupler provides the fixation of the traction motor to a gear box, which provides speed reduction and is fixed to the axle. Power circuits in the propulsion system are configured using either pneumatics or low voltage to actuate the high-current contactors, usually through <b>interlocking</b> <b>relay</b> logic.

50|$|Nürnbergerstraße {{station is}} {{classified}} by Deutsche Bahn {{as a category}} 3 station. It has a <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> of class DRS60, which is now operated from Wailblingen.|$|R
50|$|A <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> {{installation}} in Weetzen remotely {{controls the}} signal boxes at Wennigsen, while the Barsinghausen signal box controls those at Egestorf and Bantorfas well as Barsinghausen.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} project, a new {{platform}} underpass {{equipped with}} escalators was built in Mannheim Hauptbahnhof and a new <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> was put into operation in 1982.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, {{the signal}} box was {{provided}} with a new <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> system, and in 1976, the goods platform was abolished. It was upgraded to a Premium station on 7 June 1996.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} {{equipped}} with route <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> technology for managing tracks and signalling. The rail yard has 2 washing lines for maintenance or train rakes. It has also got a coach care facility with capacity of 2 coaches.|$|R
50|$|The {{railway station}} is crossed by a bridge, which carries {{district}} route 4. It has a signal box containing a push-button <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> without automatic course setting built by Siemens and designated as Wf. It {{used to be}} called Wnf.|$|R
50|$|On 1 December 1988, a <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> of the SpDr L 60 {{class was}} taken into operation, it {{gradually}} took remote control of signalling at the surrounding stations: Sulzdorf and Gaildorf West in March 1989 and Schwäbisch Hall on 1 January 1990.|$|R
50|$|Signal box Hattenheim Hf {{was located}} in the station building. It used a <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> of class Dr S2, which was put into {{operation}} in 1954. The signal box {{was taken out of}} operation on 3 October 2014 at 3:30 am to be replaced by an electronic interlocking.|$|R
50|$|At the Rajendra Nagar Terminal and Patna Junction route <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> (RRI) {{system were}} {{installed}} between 7 February 2012 till 12 February. The presence of RRI system allows computer operated change of tracks for running trains. The presence of RRT system improves {{the safety of}} the railway traffic in the region.|$|R
5000|$|Dyce {{lost its}} {{semaphore}} signals in October 2007 when new colour light signals were brought into use. The lever frame {{was removed from}} the signal box (renamed from [...] "Dyce Junction" [...] to [...] "Dyce") and a new <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> and 'NX' (entrance-exit) panel was installed, initially housed inside a temporary signal box.|$|R
50|$|On 14 April 1969, the Isb and If signal {{boxes were}} {{replaced}} by a new combined signal box called If, which took over {{the functions of the}} Bf and Bn signal boxes in Dreieich-Buchschlag. It is a <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> of class Sp Dr S 60 (a Siemens pushbutton interlocking introduced in 1960). The interlocking is still operating today.|$|R
50|$|Leipzig-Wahren station did {{not receive}} a central signal box, only a signal box at its exit with a track-diagram <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> of the GS II DR type. Also, colour-light signals were not {{installed}} throughout the station and were essentially only used as entry signals and on the passenger tracks. Electrodynamic track brakes were installed on the marshalling-yard hump.|$|R
50|$|The East West Line is {{currently}} equipped with Westinghouse fixed block signalling system with Automatic train control (ATC) under Automatic train operation (ATO) GoA 2 (STO). The subsystems consist of Automatic train protection (ATP) to govern train speed, Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) {{to track and}} schedule trains and a <b>Relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> system that prevents incorrect signal and track points to be set.|$|R
50|$|The station had two signal boxes, one in {{the eastern}} part of the station and {{one in the}} west. Meanwhile, they have been taken out of use. Since the 1990s, the {{signalling}} at the station has been controlled from Hinterweidenthal station, two kilometres west on the line from Landau to Rohrbach by means of a <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> of the Sp Dr S60 class.|$|R
50|$|Between 1977 and 1982 a new <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> system (class SpDrS60) was installed, {{replacing}} the electro-mechanical interlocking {{at the eastern}} end of the station and three push button interlockings {{in the rest of the}} station area. In the mid-1980s, the new signal box controlled 74 km of line with 721 appliances (including 250 sets of points and derails as well as 66 main signals).|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} three {{platform}} tracks, comprising the “home” platform beside the station building and an island platform. To the east there are freight sidings and a freight siding {{to a nearby}} enterprise. To the West {{there is a connection}} to a former site of the sugar manufacturer Südzucker, which operated an extensive system of tracks. Since 1970, the rail traffic has been controlled by a <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> of Dr L2 type {{was located}} in the station {{building}} and controlled the station's two through tracks, {{as well as the}} two marshalling yards with a loading ramp north and south of the line. It was put into operation in 1956 and has been remotely-controlled from the Saarbrücken control centre since 1 September 1972. Operations were directed by an on-site dispatcher, who implemented the control commands sent from the control centre. The signal box was no longer occupied from 1 September 1982 and direct control of the signalling and points was assumed by the Saarbrücken centre. When the electronic interlocking in Saarbrücken was commissioned in October 1998, the <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> was taken out of service. Since November 2003, the dispatcher responsible for local operations has been located in the Karlsruhe operations centre. The decommissioning of the signal box and the changeover to the electronic interlocking also resulted in the reclassification of the station from a full station (Bahnhof) to a halt (Haltepunkt).Until the beginning of the 1970s, the on-site dispatcher was responsible for ticket sales.|$|R
25|$|The old {{signalling}} system was overlaid during resignalling in 2017 {{but is still}} able to operate. The old {{signalling system}} consists of Westinghouse fixed block signalling system with Automatic train control (ATC) under Automatic train operation (ATO) GoA 2 (STO). The subsystems consist of Automatic train protection (ATP) to govern train speed, Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) to track and schedule trains and a <b>Relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> system that prevents incorrect signal and track points to be set.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s Radebeul West Station was rebuilt in {{preparation}} for a future mixed-gauge operation and correspondingly large clearance gauge so that it could handle Soviet broad-gauge wagons (1520 mm gauge). A modern signal box with <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> (WSSB GS II Sp 64 b type) was installed during the reconstruction of the station with four platform tracks. This was the first of this type installed by Deutsche Reichsbahn. It went into operation on 27 March 1969.|$|R
50|$|Signalling {{systems are}} also being {{upgraded}} by adopting state-of-the-art technology. The semaphore signalling system is being replaced by a colour light signalling system. Use of colour light signals results in better visibility of signalling aspects to the drivers of the running trains and this makes train running safer and operationally more efficient. The interlocking system is also being changed to panel or route <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking.</b> Besides speedier movement of traffic, these up-gradation measures contribute towards increased safety.|$|R
50|$|The former {{entrance}} {{building was}} built in 1848 and 1849 in the Neoclassical style. It was expanded in 1896. There is a memorial stone dedicated to the House of Wittelsbach on the station forecourt. It consists of an iron plate and was erected in 1880. The entrance building and the memorial stone are both classified as historical monuments. The station itself was previously controlled by a Siemens press button <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> without automatic route-setting, which is now out of operation.|$|R
50|$|By 1980, the {{signalling}} systems {{had been}} upgraded on the Berlin-Halle line {{in preparation for}} the electrification of the line. Ludwigsfelde station received a new interlocking of the GS II sp64 class, with an existing signalbox being used as the operations room. Automatic block signalling was installed on the line towards Thyrow. During upgrading the line to 200 km/h, the <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> was taken out of service in 2000 after just twenty years of operation and replaced by an electronic interlocking of the Simis C class.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} a {{terminal}} station; trains {{must go back}} {{the same way as}} they come. With many trains arriving at the same time platforms are not always available. In case any train is late, the other trains are stopped at Duvvada or Vizianagaram. The Route <b>Relay</b> <b>Interlocking</b> (RRI) system, an arrangement of signal apparatus that prevents conflicting movements through an arrangement of tracks such as junctions or crossings, is reported {{to be one of the}} major causes for these trains being delayed after Duvvada Station.|$|R
50|$|Following council {{approval}} of the project in June 1953, construction began in February 1954. The project involved both the building of new railway facilities {{and the construction of}} the new station building. All the tracks and signals had to be connected to a newly built signal box, {{which was one of the}} most modern <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> systems of the time. Rail services were maintained throughout the work. A total of 250,000 cubic metres of soil was moved in order to allow the railway embankment to be raised by more than 4 metres over 2.1 km.|$|R
50|$|Around 1880 {{the station}} {{building}} {{was built to}} a design of the architect Hans Kleinschmidt. A <b>relay</b> <b>interlocking</b> in a gantry signal box spanning two tracks was put into operation in 1937. The Bingen Stadt signal box (Bnb) and the three signal boxes of Bingerbrück Ostturm (Bot), Bingerbrück Kreuzbach (Bkb) and Bingerbrück Westturm (Bwt) in the nearby Bingen Hbf were decommissioned on 3 February 1996 and replaced by the central interlocking Bf on the railway bridge at Bingen Hbf. Today, the Bingen Stadt Bnb signal box is protected as a monument.|$|R
