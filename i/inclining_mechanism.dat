50|$|All the machines, {{regardless}} of capacity, were about 7 inches (18 cm) wide and from 4 up to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) tall (the tallest ones had an <b>incline</b> <b>mechanism).</b> A 20-digit machine was 2 ft 4 in (70 cm) long while the length a 10-digit machine was around 1 ft 6 in (45 cm).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With the {{deepening}} of researching on parallel mechanism, {{a variety of}} parallel mechanism and corresponding modeling method are presented, but these methods are not universal. So this paper deals with a class of spoke <b>inclined</b> parallel <b>mechanism</b> as the object, {{trying to get the}} general modeling method of kinematics and dynamics, which will pro-vide convenient on this kind of parallel mechanism. Kinematics model with inverse selection criteria is established using geometric method, dynamics model is established by Lagrange method, then the mapping relationship between input-output displacement and driving force of the parallel mechanism are presented; Set 45 ° angle as an example, the prototype of spoke <b>inclined</b> parallel <b>mechanism</b> is developed based on dSPACE real-time simulation system, the validation experi-ments and rotation performance test experiments are done using the methods combining the theoretical modeling and ex-perimental validation. The experimental results show that the mathematical model is correct, the parallel mechanism has the advantage of low inertia and large angle, the maximum angle of the prototype can reach 51. 4 °. The parallel mecha-nism in this paper can be used for automobile coating and manufacturing, and the research will lay the foundation for fur-ther application in mechanical industry...|$|R
2500|$|The Great <b>Incline</b> cable <b>mechanism</b> was {{engineered}} by Andrew Smith Hallidie of San Francisco cable car fame. It climbed [...] with approximately [...] of cable spliced into a complete loop which raised {{and lowered the}} cars of the Incline. At the Echo summit an incline powerhouse was erected to house the winding motor and gear works which powered the [...] grip wheel. The wheel consisted of 72 clamping “finger” mechanisms which bit down on the cable creating a smooth, non-slip actuation of the winding cable.|$|R

40|$|We {{perform a}} laboratory-scale {{experiment}} of submarine avalanches on a rough inclined plane. A sediment layer is prepared and thereafter tilted {{up to an}} angle lower than the spontaneous avalanche angle. The sediment is scrapped until an avalanche is triggered. Based on the stability diagram of the sediment layer, we investigate different structures for the avalanche front dynamics. First we see a straight front descending the slope, and then a transverse instability occurs. Eventually, a fingering instability shows up similar to rivulets appearing for a viscous fluid flowing down an <b>incline.</b> The <b>mechanisms</b> leading to this new instability and the wavelength selection are discussed.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} {{flame front}} for the inverse wave (with trailing combustion front) of filtration combustion of solid fuel. This problem naturally demands coupled Euler-Lagrange approach, as it contains phenomena that are inherent for gaseous or disperse phase. It is found that propagation of plane combustion front becomes unstable under certain conditions; as a result, the front spontaneously <b>inclines.</b> The thermo-hydrodynamic <b>mechanism</b> (originating from temperature dependence of gas permeability) is responsible for inclination developing...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge about {{dispersion}} is {{of utmost}} importance for understanding populations’ reaction {{to changes in the}} environment. Expansion of a population range brings with it both spatial sorting and over time, spatial selection. This means that dispersion rates increases over time at the expanding edge. Most studies have so far been performed on continuously expanding populations. This study aims to bring more knowledge about dispersal biology in dynamic systems. I studied dispersal traits in two permanent and two seasonal vegetation habitats of an isopod (Asellus aquaticus), for which differentiation between habitat types has previously been shown. I quantified differences in displacement (dispersal rate) and three morphological traits, head angle (body streamline) and leg of the third and seventh pair of legs. Isopods from the seasonal vegetation had higher displacement rates than animals from permanent vegetation. This <b>inclines</b> that <b>mechanisms</b> driving spatial selection in expanding population ranges also exist in dynamic systems. The more streamlined isopods found in seasonal sites further points towards spatial sorting by dispersion capability. Because no effect of permanence was found on leg length and there was no correlation between streamlining and displacement, the higher dispersion among animals from seasonal habitats most likely derives from behavioral differences...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive {{studies of}} afterlife beliefs suggest that belief in {{life after death}} is {{intuitive}} and founded on pan-cultural cognitive processes. In the past decade, researchers have established that as children increasingly understand biological death, they also increasingly attribute continued mental functioning to dead people yet are less inclined to attribute continuing biological attributes to the deceased. Thus, Bering and others argue that natural cognitive <b>mechanisms</b> <b>incline</b> us to believe in psychological immortality. Research on afterlife beliefs has been conducted primarily in cultures that have historically dominant afterlife beliefs, not in those Asian contexts that are alleged to be skeptical of an afterlife, those alleged to be Confucian. If a culture as vast and influential as China 2 ̆ 7 s were not to evidence afterlife beliefs, some foundational claims of the cognitive science of religion would, very likely, be refuted. Graham claims that pre-Han philosophy knows nothing of a mind-body dichotomy, arguing that it emerged in China centuries later through the influence of Indian Buddhism. Rosemont and Ames claim that the Chinese have a relational, not substantial conception of the self or soul. Jullien claims that for the Chinese no dualism is possible. 2 ̆ 2 If the Chinese lacked a conception of mind-body dualism, then they likely lacked a standard conception of the afterlife. If intuitive dualism is pan-cultural and is instigative of afterlife beliefs, we should expect to find representations of disembodied spirits in the earliest Chinese historical texts. We take Slingerlands work as our starting point. Rather than focus on xin, however, we focus on Chinese terms associated with soul or spirit [...] hun and po [...] and their movements in life, death and the afterlife. We construct an intuitive database from pre-Qin texts to determine the nature and prevalence of soul/spirit terms {{and the relationship of}} soul/spirit to body, and discuss whether these representations correspond to claims to intuitive dualism and afterlife beliefs argued for by cognitive science...|$|R
