5|$|Thirteen {{years before}} the present, Robert Fassl (W. Earl Brown) sits in his van. He later {{approaches}} a home and claims {{to be there to}} repair the cable. As Fassl holds up a piece of paper to show it to the family who called for the repair, blood spatter splashes across the paper. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sees the house's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood. Abruptly, two police officers burst into the house and apprehend Fassl. One of the officers who goes to check out the kitchen turns to reveal he is John Doggett (Robert Patrick) as a young NYPD officer.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

60|$|Bennet {{has come}} down very quietly. Fanny, from where he stands, {{is the only one}} who sees him. He stands looking at her, his features, as ever, immovable. At sight of him her eyes and mouth open wider and wider. The words die away from her tongue. Vernon has turned away to put a log on the fire, and so has not seen her expression-- only hears her sudden silence. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sees Bennet.|$|E
6000|$|... “Any squirming skunk {{can talk}} like that. He {{was so busy}} with the drawers that {{the first thing he}} heard was a shout, Great Heavens. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> there was the door open (Cloete had left the key in the lock) and Captain Harry holding on, well above him, very fierce {{in the light of the}} burning papers. His eyes were {{starting}} out of his head. Thieving, he thunders at him. A sailor! An officer! No! A wretch like you deserves no better than to be left here to drown.|$|E

Five years ago I was on a raft as big as this, and right along here it was a bright moonshiny night, and I was on watch and boss of the stabboard oar forrard, and one of my pards was a man named Dick Allbright, and he come along to where I was sitting, forrard--gaping and stretching, he was--and stooped {{down on the edge of}} the raft and washed his face in the river, and come and set down by me and got out his pipe, and had just got it filled, when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> says-- ...|$|E

All of a sudden I see Mr. Morrison set down his glass {{and stare at the}} other chap as though he'd seen {{something}} that had given him a turn. I leaned over the counter and had a look, too. There he sat--this tall, fair chap {{who had been in the}} place so long--with his big pocket-book on the table in front of him, and even from where I was I could see that there was a great pile of bank-notes sticking out from it. All of a sudden <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sees Mr. Morrison a-watching him and me from behind the counter. Back he whisks the pocket-book into his pocket, calls me for my bill, gives me two mouldy pennies for a tip, buttons up his coat and walks out." ...|$|E
60|$|The whore skulks {{about in}} lodgings, is visited in the dark, disowned upon all {{occasions}} before God and man; is maintained, indeed, for a time, but is certainly condemned {{to be abandoned}} at last, and left to the miseries of fate and her own just disaster. If she has any children, her endeavour is {{to get rid of}} them, and not maintain them; and if she lives, she is certain to see them all hate her, and be ashamed of her. While the vice rages, and the man is in the devil's hand, she has him; and while she has him, she makes a prey of him; but if he happens to fall sick, if any disaster befalls him, the cause of all lies upon her. He is sure to lay all his misfortunes at her door; and if once he comes to repentance, or makes but one step towards a reformation, he begins with her--leaves her, uses her as she deserves, hates her, abhors her, and sees her no more; and that with this never-failing addition, namely, that the more sincere and unfeigned his repentance is, the more earnestly <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> the more effectually he looks in, the more his aversion to her increases, and he curses her from the bottom of his soul; nay, it must be a kind of excess of charity if he so much as wishes God may forgive her.|$|E
60|$|The rest of {{the course}} is a reduced magnificence, in spite of {{interesting}} bits, of the battered pomp of the Pesaro and the Cornaro, of the recurrent memories of royalty in exile which cluster about the Palazzo Vendramin Calergi, once the residence of the Comte de Chambord and still that of his half-brother, in spite too of the big Papadopoli gardens, opposite the station, the largest private grounds in Venice, but of which Venice in general mainly gets the benefit in the usual form of irrepressible greenery climbing over walls and nodding at water. The rococo church of the Scalzi is here, all marble and malachite, all a cold, hard glitter and a costly, curly ugliness, and here too, opposite, {{on the top of}} its high steps, is San Simeone Profeta, I won't say immortalised, but unblushingly misrepresented, by the perfidious Canaletto. I shall not stay to unravel the mystery of this prosaic painter's malpractices; he falsified without fancy, and as he apparently transposed at will the objects he reproduced, one is never sure of the particular view that may have constituted his subject. It would look exactly like such and such a place if almost everything were not different. San Simeone Profeta appears to hang there upon the wall; but it is {{on the wrong side of}} the Canal and the other elements quite fail to correspond. One's confusion is the greater because one doesn't know that everything may not really have changed, even beyond all probability--though it's only in America that churches cross the street or the river--and the mixture of the recognisable and the different makes the ambiguity maddening, all the more that the painter is almost as attaching as he is bad. Thanks at any rate to the white church, domed and porticoed, on the top of its steps, the traveller emerging for the first time upon the terrace of the railway-station seems to have a Canaletto before him. He speedily discovers indeed even in the presence of this scene of the final accents of the Canalazzo- -there is a charm in the old pink warehouses on the hot fondamenta--that he has something much better. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down at the gathered gondolas; he has his surprise after all, his little first Venetian thrill; and as the terrace of the station ushers in these things we shall say no harm of it, though it is not lovely. It is the beginning of his experience, but it is the end of the Grand Canal.|$|E

"To the contagionist, filled {{as he is}} {{with the}} dread of final [...] causes, having no faith in destiny, nor in the fixed will of God, [...] and {{with none of the}} devil-may-care {{indifference}} which might stand [...] him instead of creeds--to such one, every rag that shivers in the [...] breeze of a plague-stricken city has this sort of sublimity. If by [...] any terrible ordinance he be forced to venture forth, he sees death [...] dangling from every sleeve; and, as he creeps forward, he poises his [...] shuddering limbs between the imminent jacket that is stabbing at his [...] right elbow and the murderous pelisse that threatens to mow him [...] clean down as it sweeps along on his left. But most of all he [...] dreads that which most of all he should love--the touch of a woman's [...] dress; for mothers and wives, hurrying forth on kindly errands from [...] the bedsides of the dying, go slouching along through the streets [...] more willfully and less courteously than the men. For a while it [...] may be that the caution of the poor Levantine may enable him to [...] avoid contact, but sooner or later, perhaps, the dreaded chance [...] arrives; that bundle of linen, with the dark tearful eyes at the top [...] of it, that labors along with the voluptuous clumsiness of Grisi [...] --she has touched the poor Levantine with the hem of her sleeve! From [...] that dread moment his peace is gone; his mind for ever hanging upon [...] the fatal touch invites the blow which he fears; he watches for the [...] symptoms of plague so carefully, that sooner or later they come in [...] truth. The parched mouth is a sign--his mouth is parched; the [...] throbbing brain--his brain does throb; the rapid pulse--he touches [...] his own wrist (for he dares not ask counsel of any man lest he be [...] deserted), he touches his wrist, and feels how his frighted blood [...] goes galloping out of his heart. There is nothing but the fatal [...] swelling that is wanting to make his sad conviction complete; [...] immediately, he has an odd feel under the arm--no pain, but a little [...] straining of the skin; he would to God it were his fancy that were [...] strong enough to give him that sensation; this is the worst of all. [...] It now seems to him that he could be happy and contented with his [...] parched mouth, and his throbbing brain, and his rapid pulse, if only [...] he could know that there were no swelling under the left arm; but [...] dares he try?--in a moment of calmness and deliberation he dares [...] not; but when for a while he has writhed under the torture of [...] suspense, a sudden strength of will drives him to seek and know his [...] fate; he touches the gland, and finds the skin sane and sound but [...] under the cuticle there lies a small lump like a pistol-bullet, that [...] moves as he pushes it. Oh! but is this for all certainty, is this [...] the sentence of death? Feel the gland of the other arm. There is [...] not the same lump exactly, yet something a little like it. Have not [...] some people glands naturally enlarged?--would to heaven he were one! [...] So he does for himself the work of the plague, and when the Angel of [...] Death thus courted does indeed and in truth come, he has only to [...] finish that which has been so well begun; he passes his fiery hand [...] over the brain of the victim, and lets him rave for a season, but [...] all chance-wise, of people and things once dear, or of people and [...] things indifferent. Once more the poor fellow is back at his home [...] in fair Provence, and sees the sundial that stood in his childhood's [...] garden--sees his mother, and the long-since forgotten face of that [...] little dear sister--(he sees her, he says, on a Sunday morning, for [...] all the church bells are ringing); <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down through the [...] universe, and owns it well piled with bales upon bales of cotton, [...] and cotton eternal--so much so that he feels--he knows--he swears he [...] could make that winning hazard, if the billiard-table would not [...] slant upwards, and if the cue were a cue worth playing with; but it [...] is not--it's a cue that won't move--his own arm won't move--in [...] short, there's the devil to pay in the brain of the poor Levantine; [...] and perhaps, the next night but one he becomes the 'life and the [...] soul' of some squalling jackal family, who fish him out by the foot [...] from his shallow and sandy grave." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, Bowie {{starred in}} an XM Radio {{commercial}} {{in which he}} falls through {{the roof of a}} motel. Upon standing, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> states [...] "I'll never get used to that." ...|$|E

5000|$|On {{the first}} night, when the cossacks take {{her body to}} a ruined church, he is {{somewhat}} frightened but calms himself when he lights more candles in the church to eliminate most of the darkness. As he begins to say prayers, he imagines to himself that the corpse is getting up, but it never does. Suddenly, however, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> finds that the witch is sitting up in her coffin. She begins to walk around, reaching out for someone, and begins to approach Khoma, but he draws a circle of protection around himself that she cannot cross.|$|E
50|$|As Gould sees Deacon's body {{being carried}} away, {{he takes out}} Deacon's Book of Mormon, places the photo of Deacon's wife into Deacon's hands and keeps the book, which Deacon had offered to him earlier, and wishes him to rest in peace. After this, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sees a P-51 Mustang fighter flying over, {{signaling}} that the weather is improving, and the turning of the tide in the Battle. Gould encounters a now captured Rudolph, nods to him, with Rudolph answering back in kind, and then helps an injured German soldier whom he recognizes from the massacre {{at the start of}} the film.|$|E

50|$|Mimaki has a court {{ritual in}} which the new translator, Toyo, comes and {{declares}} the Sun God is still within Himiko. Mimaki is disturbed by this. Nashime breaks down crying. The film flashes forward several years, and Nashime is walking in the forest, old and fragile, still crying over Himiko. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sees a helicopter. The camera pans {{out of the forest}} to reveal that it is atop a kofun, or ancient keyhole-shaped burial mound, surrounded by a suburban neighborhood with offices, houses, factories and a highway, revealing the film as a mythical fable shrouded from, yet within, modern times. The credits roll with aerial shots of more ancient tumuli and their modern surroundings.|$|E
