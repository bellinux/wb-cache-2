40|$|In recent years, the {{development}} of a high power <b>transistor</b> <b>element</b> is proceeding. A high power inverter circuit using power transistors are finding a good number of applications in induction heating and melting. Turn off time of power transistors occupies 5 -lOμs of switching characteristics. A driving method to give base inputs for a half period is widely used for a inverter circuit. But this method has the following defects, the short-circuit current flows through two transistors because the other pair transistors turn on before one pair transistors turn off. So the switching loss is increased, the maximum output and the efficiency are decreased. In this paper, a driving method to give base inputs for the less period as compared with a half period is discussed. Using this method, the foregoing defects is lost and the driving frequency is able to become higher. In addition, it become clear that the square waveform output is given using this method in the case of R-L load...|$|R

40|$|Terahertz (THz) {{wireless}} communication systems over 300 GHz can offer broad bandwidth, {{but they have}} limitations, such as high precision fabrication requirements, high fabrication cost and lossy system components. This thesis introduces a THz communication system concept based on low-cost and high precision micromachining techniques, also a new design approach to achieve a low loss system for THz communication components and systems. In order to minimise the components and systems losses, this thesis proposes a design approach for filtering amplifiers which removes the lossy planar matching and interconnection circuits to complete the transistor amplifiers design. The technique also adds filters resulting in a combined filtering amplifier. To enable this, an analytical design method for filtering amplifiers based on the conventional passive coupling matrix for filters is expanded for the filtering amplifiers. Novel coupled resonator circuits, including a general transistor model {{for the first time}} is investigated and a new [T] matrix is introduced to facilitate the <b>transistor</b> <b>element.</b> Complete mathematical formulas are provided in this thesis for the coupled resonator circuits for transistor amplifiers. Two physical design examples at X band are provided in this thesis to demonstrate the usage of the novel coupling matrix with a simple mathematical synthesis. A waveguide filtering amplifier is demonstrated using waveguide resonators. This waveguide amplifier reflects the design considerations and methods for future THz amplifier developments. Good correlations between mathematical synthesis results and physical measurements are achieved for the waveguide filtering amplifier, with 3 clearly observed poles in passband, verifying the order of the filters. ...|$|R
