Experiments were conducted in a circulating fluidized bed, having perforated plates as <b>internals</b> covering wide range in the operating parameters. The effects of various operating parameters, i. e., initial moisture content, temperature, and flow rate, of the heating medium and solid circulation rate on the rate of drying have been critically examined. It has been observed from the present investigation {{that the presence of}} <b>internals</b> enhances the solids holdup in the riser of circulating fluidized bed. The drying efficiency of a circulating fluidized bed with <b>internals</b> has been compared with the drying performance of a circulating fluidized bed without <b>internals</b> under the same operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|Highly {{cohesive}} powders aggregate into wide-size-disuibution fluidized agglomerates in fast bed, {{which can}} severely aggravate the fluidizing quality. In {{order to reduce}} the agglomerate size of highly cohesive powders in riser, "floating internals" are added into riser to cause the breakage of agglomerates. Floating <b>internals</b> are floated by the two-phase flow of gas and cohesive particles in riser. However, the floating <b>internals</b> should not be entrained into particle return system, and, should not have any reaction with powders or gas. Therefore the fast fluidization of cohesive particles with floating <b>internals</b> is different from the circulating fluidization of fine-coarse particle mixtures. Experiments on floating <b>internals</b> were conducted in a glass riser of 3. 25 m in height and 0. 075 m I. D, and four kinds of cohesive powders and floating <b>internals</b> were involved. Experimental results showed that appropriate matching of floating <b>internals</b> with cohesive particles could effectively avoid the formation of over-large agglomerates in the riser. A model has also been developed to predict the largest agglomerate size which floating <b>internals</b> could break under certain operating conditions. Comparing with experimental values, the predicted results of the model are reasonable and acceptable...|$|R
40|$|<b>Internals</b> of {{different}} types are required {{in a number of}} industrial applications of bubble columns to achieve the desired mixing or to remove the heat of reaction to maintain desired temperature and isothermal conditions of operation. Some of these applications include Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, methanol synthesis, and production of dimethyl ether (DME). The presence of <b>internals</b> however can alter the column hydrodynamics and mixing patterns which could influence reactor performance. A fast response probe capable of capturing bubble dynamics, as well as detecting flow direction is used to study the effect of <b>internals</b> on local heat transfer and column hydrodynamics in a bubble column with and without solid particles. It captured the temporal variations in heat transfer coefficients due to changes in local hydrodynamic conditions. Measurements obtained in presence {{of different}} configurations and combinations of <b>internals</b> are compared with those without <b>internals</b> to elucidate the effects of <b>internals</b> design and configurations. Comparisons are based on average values and fluctuating component of local temporal variations of the heat transfer coefficient obtained with the fast response probe. The average gas holdup, center line liquid, and bubble rise velocities obtained with and without <b>internals</b> are also compared. The observed differences are discussed based on the insights provided by these comparisons. The heat transfer coefficient and gas holdup increases in presence of <b>internals.</b> Relationships between local heat transfer measurements and hydrodynamic conditions with <b>internals</b> are shown and discussed. The observed increase in heat transfer coefficients with scale can be related to increase in liquid circulation velocity with column diameter, which in turn is related to an increase in large bubbles rise velocity...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{influence}} of interfacial forces, including drag force and lateral forces (lift force, turbulent dispersion force and wall force) on the hydrodynamics in pilot-scale bubble columns with <b>internals</b> is analyzed. The {{results indicate that}} the lateral forces may be optional for the hollow columns, but they are required to accurately predict flow characteristics in the bubble columns with <b>internals.</b> Furthermore, it has been found that the bubbly flow behavior in the bubble columns with <b>internals</b> is more sensitive to the lateral forces in comparison with those without <b>internals,</b> and the complex geometry significantly alters the response of bubbly flow to the interfacial forces. In addition, despite the insignificant effect on gas holdup, the presence of <b>internals</b> gives rise to an enhancement of large-scale liquid circulation due to the remarkable decrease of turbulent viscosity.

40|$|Our {{previous}} studies have shown evident technical superiorities of oil shale pyrolysis in a newly devised fixed bed reactor with particularly designed <b>internals</b> (Fuel Processing Technology, 138, 2015 : 147 - 155). This study is furthered to optimize the operating conditions {{by focusing on the}} reaction pressure to enhance the yield and quality of shale oil in the fixed bed reactor with <b>internals.</b> Reducing the pyrolysis pressure increased the shale oil yield in comparison with the pyrolysis under atmospheric pressure. This influence due to reducing reaction pressure appeared to be higher in the reactor with <b>internals</b> than in the reactor without any <b>internals.</b> Moreover, there were higher yield of aliphatic components and fewer aromatic species in the reactor with <b>internals,</b> essentially indicating the suppressed secondary reactions to the produced primary shale oil in the new reactor. In this reactor the shale oil yield reached 97. 57 % of the Fisher Assay yield (8. 24 wt. % dry basis) at a furnace heating temperature of 1000 degrees C under reduced pressure conditions. Consequently, there is actually some synergistic effect between <b>internals</b> and reducing pressure so that adopting <b>internals</b> and using vacuum condition can grant the indirectly heated fixed bed reactor great potential to achieve high yield and high quality of shale oil in oil shale pyrolysis.

40|$|Twenty-three {{undergraduate}} {{college students}} participated in four weekly frontalis EMG biofeedback sessions. Subjects were initially divided into <b>internals</b> and externals by the Health Locus of Control scale, and assigned to a biofeedback or control condition. Training {{was followed by a}} post-test with the Health Locus of Control scale. It was predicted that <b>internals</b> would achieve greater EMG decreases than externals. It was also hypothesized that biofeedback externals would achieve great er pretest to post-test (internally directed) changes in health locus of control scores than the control externals. Pretest to post-test EMG levels were obtained {{for each of the four}} sessions for both the biofeedback and control conditions. Some support for the fir s t hypothesis was indicated by a significant interaction between condition and health locus of control group, based on EMG change scores (pretest session one minus post-test session four). Results of a Scheffe test on mean pairs indicated significant differences between biofeedback <b>internals</b> and control <b>internals,</b> and biofeedback <b>internals</b> and control externals. Thus, among the <b>internals,</b> those in the biofeedback condition achieved greater EMG decreases than those in the control condition, and under the biofeedback condition, <b>internals</b> exhibited greater EMG decreases than externals. A nonparametric sign test on the health locus of control regressed change scores was nonsignificant, failing to support the second hypothesis...|$|R
