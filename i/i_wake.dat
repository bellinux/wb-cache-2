At 11:10p.m. (PDT), while they were stopped at a red light at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in front of the Maxim Hotel, a vehicle occupied by two women pulled up on their left side. Shakur, who was standing up through the sunroof, exchanged words with the women and invited them to Club 662. At 11:15p.m. (PDT), a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac with an unknown number of occupants pulled up to the sedan's right side, rolled down a window, and rapidly fired gunshots at Shakur. He was hit four times, twice in the chest, once in the arm, and once in the thigh. One of the bullets went into Shakur's right lung. Knight was hit in the head by fragmentation. The bodyguard, Frank Alexander, stated that, when he was about to ride along with the rapper in Knight's car, Shakur asked him to drive the car of Shakur's fiancée, Kidada Jones, instead, in case they needed additional vehicles for the drive from Club 662 to the hotel. The bodyguard reported in his documentary, Before <b>I</b> <b>Wake,</b> that, shortly after the assault, one of the convoy's cars drove off after the assailant but that he never heard from the occupants.|$|E

500|$|Clarke {{has been}} {{described}} by Stephen Banfield as the most distinguished British female composer of the inter-war generation. However, her later output was sporadic. She suffered from dysthymia, a chronic form of depression; the lack of encouragement—sometimes outright discouragement—she received for her work also made her reluctant to compose. Clarke did not consider herself able to balance her personal life and the demands of composition: [...] "I can't do it unless it's the first thing I think of every morning when <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> and the last thing I think of every night before I go to sleep." [...] After her marriage, she stopped composing, despite the encouragement of her husband, although she continued working on arrangements until shortly before her death.

[...] "Dame" [...] is a R-lite" [...] with tune hip-hop influences. Los Angeles Times music critic Enrique Lopetegui wrote that the album is [...] "basically {{a continuation of the}} singer's favorite turf - ... woman-melting ballads." [...] The first track on the album, [...] "Si Te Vas", is a song about the narrator who yearns to remain with his lover: ("Every morning when <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> up, I feel anxiety in my soul, I want to listen to your voice, I want to feel your kisses"). The power ballads in the album are [...] "Que Tú Te Vas", [...] "Abrázame", [...] "Un Día Más", and the title track.

500|$|... "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is {{the longest}} of the 1819 odes with 8 stanzas {{containing}} 10 lines each. The poem begins by describing {{the state of the}} poet, using negative statements to intensify the description of the poet's physical state such as [...] "numbless pains" [...] and [...] "not through envy of thy happy lot" [...] (lines 1–5). While the ode is written [...] "to a Nightingale", the emphasis of the first line is placed upon the narrator rather than the bird, and Helen Vendler suggests that the negation of the reader as a party in the discourse happens just as the song of the nightingale becomes the [...] "voice of pure self-expression". In the third stanza, the poet asks the nightingale to [...] "Fade far away", casting it off just as the narrator in [...] "Ode to Indolence" [...] rejects the Love, Ambition, and Poesy and the poet in [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] banishes the figures on the urn to silence. In the fourth stanza, the poet states that he will fly to the nightingale rather than it to him, moving upon the [...] "wings of Poesy", which leaves Walter Jackson Bate to believe that while the poet intends to identify with the bird by describing the poem as being [...] "to" [...] it, the real identification in the narrative exists between the poet and his perceptions of the nightingale's song. In its closing, the poem questions whether the bird's song has been real or part of a dream: [...] "Was it a vision, or a waking dream? / Fled is that music:—do <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> or sleep?" [...] (lines 79–80), and the theme of imagination once again arises as the poet appears, according to Timothy Hilton, unable to distinguish between his own artistic imagination and the song which he believes to have spurred it into action.|$|E

500|$|Livingstone's {{success with}} the {{congestion}} charge and rejuvenation of Trafalgar Square led the Labour leadership to reconsider their position on him, with Blair re-admitting him to the party and asking that he stand as their Mayoral candidate for the 2004 election. Livingstone eagerly agreed, and Labour Mayoral candidate Nicky Gavron volunteered to take a subordinate position as his deputy. In campaigning for the election, Livingstone highlighted his record: the congestion charge, free bus travel for under 11s, 1000 extra buses, and 5000 extra police officers, whereas his main competitor, the Conservative Steve Norris, campaigned primarily on a policy of abolishing the congestion charge. Livingstone continued to court controversy throughout the campaign; in June 2004 he was quoted on The Guardians website as saying: [...] "I just long for the day <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> up and find that the Saudi Royal Family are swinging from lamp-posts and they've got a proper government that represents the people of Saudi Arabia", {{for which he was}} widely criticised. That same month he came under criticism from sectors of the left for urging RMT members to cross picket lines in a proposed Underground strike because the latest offer had been [...] "extremely generous", leading RMT general secretary Bob Crow to step down as a TfL board member. In the London mayoral election, 2004, Livingstone was announced as the winner on 10 June 2004. He won 36% of first preference votes to Norris's 28% and Liberal Democrat Simon Hughes's 15%. When all the candidates except Livingstone and Norris were eliminated and the second preferences of those voters who had picked neither Livingstone or Norris as their first choice were counted, Livingstone won with 55% to Norris's 45%.|$|E
500|$|Bell {{said that}} at first Anna was written plainer and more general. [...] "In {{the first draft of}} the script she was written more, in my opinion, prissy. She was kind of {{specific}} and very girly," [...] which Bell didn't find appealing. She admitted that she had always {{wanted to be part of}} Disney animated feature, but she [...] "wanted to be a very specific type of princess", who [...] "was way more awkward than the normal princesses", not someone with too good postures or too well-spoken. As she was offered the role of Anna, she came up with a lot of suggestions for the directors. They were responsive and allowed the actress to mould the character the way she wanted, since they wanted the film to be truthful. Bell significantly made specific changes to Anna, including the infusion and incorporation of the actress' own personality to the character, [...] embodying a relatable heroine, which received full support from the directors. She called the scene where Anna first meets Hans is a [...] "typical Disney moment", as they come too close physically and find out that they both fall in love with each other. Bell wanted Anna's words to reflect what she herself would say in real life, which included some [...] "nonsensical rambling". [...] "I think I said, [...] "This is awkward. You're not awkward. Me, I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait—what?" [...] Words just spill out of her mouth too quickly and she has to backtrack." [...] Bell continued. Or the whole scene where she wakes up in the beginning with saliva all over the face, Bell [...] "wanted her to also have hair in her mouth", which took inspiration from her own real life. [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> up like that. Then you have hair in your mouth, and you start coughing. The animators totally got what I was trying to do. It's cool, and way more fun when stuff is realistic like that, instead of the perfection of waking up with mascara on." [...] Anna's snorting and tripping over also drew inspirations from Bell's real life. Bell's recording sessions were also videotaped to assist in animating the character, and animators took into considerations even subtle things like the actress' biting her lip a lot. According to director Jennifer Lee, Anna is a bit flawed.|$|E
500|$|He {{received}} {{interest from}} Micky Adams' Port Vale, {{and joined the}} club on trial in July 2010. Acknowledging [...] "it's a last-chance saloon", Roberts said [...] "I've learnt just {{not to be a}} plonker for all my life." [...] He joined the team on their July pre-season trip to Ireland, as Adams, already convinced of the player's talents, wanted to test Roberts' ability to stay away from his off-the-field demons. Roberts seemed to enjoy a good start to his Vale career, and after Adams' typically relentless pre-season fitness regime he claimed [...] "I've turned the corner...I think I've got my act together but I've just got to keep living each day as it comes and as long as <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> up clean that's all that I need". He signed a six-month contract {{at the end of the}} month. He started the season well, maintaining discipline off the pitch, and his first team place on it, forging a midfield partnership with Anthony Griffith. As early as September he entered negotiations with the club to extend his contract, and Roberts quickly signed an extended contract to keep him at the club until the end of the season. However Micky Adams left the club in December 2010, and Roberts did not enjoy a happy relationship with new manager Jim Gannon. Gannon dropped him to the bench after Roberts admitted he did not enjoy playing in a more advanced position; Vale fans showed their support for the player by chanting his name throughout a 1–0 win over Rotherham. He then picked up a three-match ban after receiving a red card for violent conduct in a reserve match against Nottingham Forest. Gannon defended Roberts, believing the player was unlucky to be dismissed after he responded to a 'reckless' challenge by David Morgan by shoving Morgan to the ground. In March, speculation that he would leave Vale Park at the end of the season (or earlier) increased, as it was reported by BBC Radio Stoke that the club had informed the player he could leave on loan. However Gannon denied this on the club's website, stating that there was [...] "no substance" [...] to the report. In fact he went on to say [...] "he has a huge part to play" [...] in the club's promotion campaign. His teammates also showed their support for him by celebrating goals with Roberts' celebration style during his absence; club captain Marc Richards also dedicated his two goals against Shrewsbury Town to Roberts. Gannon's reign was quickly terminated, but Roberts still struggled to regain his form under caretaker-manager Mark Grew.|$|E
