5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>late</b> <b>teens</b> and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E
5|$|While 18thcentury metal mines {{had worked}} on the {{principle}} of adult men digging the ore and women and children picking and cobbing the ore ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19thcentury working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work of picking. Girls <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>late</b> <b>teens</b> forced the broken ore through a broad mesh to sort the ore ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large chunks of ore left by the riddling process into smaller chunks. Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting chunks, separating the valuable ore from waste rock. Grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing sorted ore to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240lb; 1016kg) of broken ore per day, {{depending on the type of}} stone. In the tin mines, in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, cobbing and bucking did not take place. Instead, the chunks of spalled ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate the coarse 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the tin ore from the surrounding dust and grit.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Students {{of health}} {{education}} are often {{offended by the}} transitions and challenges they face while encountering diverse people, ideas and academic workloads. They may be offended because of reasons not only related to their societal background but also to <b>their</b> basic competence <b>in</b> managing transitions. In the Asian scenario, students enter {{the first year of}} professional education <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>late</b> <b>teen</b> age along with the definition of self which was created by their parents. There are different issues that arise in this age group that may positively shape or negatively affect the personalities of students. They need to achieve a sense of balance between personal and professional traits on their own. Several students are often unable to cultivate the expected required qualities, which leads to an abject state of mind and hinder their progress. We identified the most common personal and professional hurdles in the lives of dental students and we provided experiential solutions to overcome the hurdles by using a sociable approach through an integrated, continuing education program. Methods: Designing and implementing a cohesive, amalgamated and inspiring personal and professional enhancement action program for dental students. Results: Feedback from students reflected that the needs and expectations of students vary with academic phase. In addition students expressed that this program series inculcated some positive skills, and overall, they are satisfied with the utility of the program. Conclusion: Personal and professional enhancement of students in accordance with individual needs as well as with expected requirements needs a committed administrative action plan. Our results in this context are encouraging and can be considered for application in dental institutions...|$|R

Another study indicated that dysmenorrhea was present in 36.4% of participants, and was significantly associated with lower age and lower parity. Childbearing is said to relieve dysmenorrhea, but this does not always occur. One study indicated that in nulliparous women with primary dysmenorrhea, the severity of menstrual pain decreased significantly after age 40. A questionnaire concluded that menstrual problems, including dysmenorrhea, were more common in females who had been sexually abused.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} rural girls’ {{aspirations}} of becoming migrants {{in a setting}} where girls are subjected to social constraints curtailing <b>their</b> movements <b>in</b> {{the midst of an}} otherwise mobile society, where mothers and grandmothers frequently recall <b>their</b> experiences <b>in</b> Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, and boys set off on <b>their</b> first migration <b>in</b> <b>their</b> mid- or <b>late</b> <b>teens.</b> However, the high level of mobility affects both intergenerational relations {{and the ways in which}} girls can justify their wish to migrate. Based on multi-sited ethnographic research between 2002 and 2008 in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire, the paper explores the ways in which images of success and material wealth of transnational migrants feed into adolescent girls’ imaginations of migration and its outcome. Furthermore, the paper examines how everyday relationships in rural households influence girls’ imagination about <b>their</b> future position <b>in</b> the family. The aim is thus to understand how local conceptualisations of womanhood and migration practices both create a frame for female youth’s life worlds and provide them with a range of role models whose spatial and social mobility allow them to transcend boundaries but also opens up for new demands on their resources. The paper argues that the social status ascribed to migrants in rural communities push adolescent girls to circumvent constraints on their mobility by marrying earlier and to avoid challenging their husband by accepting using their economic resources on the migrant household instead of enhancing their social status by sending remittances to their own famil...|$|R
40|$|This study {{started out}} as we {{wanted to create a}} campaign, which would keep amateur cycle athletes from using doping. We did, however, realize that the key to the {{solution}} might be found elsewhere – namely {{in the early years of}} the rider’s active sports life. Competition is a natural part of any sport, but in this study we find certain aspects of the competitive environment to be troublesome, as it might be the first step towards a more radical behaviour, such as the use of doping. Thus we decided, that the main focus of this study would be to examine and evaluate the possibility of dialogue between the coach and the youth riders regarding the competitive behaviour in the member clubs of the Danish Cycling Federation (DCU), and furthermore to examine if the dialogue could change this behaviour. During this study, we have discovered how the dialog between the coach and the youth riders regarding the phenomenon of this study, the competitive behaviour in the DCU, is close to non- existent. Whereas the coaches are aware of the possible consequences of the competitive behaviour, they believe they lack the tools to facilitate this dialogue. This fact has shown to be problematic, as the possible consequences of the behaviour could push the youth riders into believing that it is necessary to use legal performance-enhancing products, which could, in the long term, lead to the belief that it is necessary to use performance-enhancing drugs such as doping later on. This behaviour could be implied in the youth riders’ cognition from an early age, as the DCU and the clubs show a great interest in the results after a race. These results are posted on their own homepages and on the social media. This proves a conflict of interest, as the DCU only recommends that the youth riders start competing <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>late</b> <b>teen</b> years, whereas they, at the same time, post the results of children down to 9 years of age. However, it is not only the DCU and the clubs who show a great interest in posting race results. The parents of the children are very interested <b>in</b> showing how <b>their</b> children are doing in the sports, and thus opening the possibility of allowing the children to use performance-enhancing products in order to make them do better. The coaches are, to a certain degree, aware of this, but as the dialogue, regarding this topic, never happens, it is all allowed to stay as a part of this environment. Be believe, that this could be changed Konkurrencens pris by the use of an agent of change, and thereby create a new understanding of the matter amongst the youth riders and <b>their</b> parents <b>in</b> order to keep a focus on what the DCU defines as good sportsmanship. We have reached this conclusion by using the theories of Mikhail Bakhtin and Martin Buber (as put to use by Louise Phillips) and Brenda Dervin. We seek to change the existing understanding within the youth riders and their parents by understanding the topics and realities they meet within the culture, as shown by phenomenology, and then change their understanding by the use of dialogue between the youth riders and their parents and the agent of change to change the behaviour, as shown by the social constructivism. We believe, that by educating the coaches to know of the results found in this study the coaches themselves could be the agents of change if given the correct tools to facilitate this dialogue. We have conducted empirical research in order to find out how the youth riders and the coaches understand this topic of the behaviour themselves. By making surveys and by interviewing our target group we have sought to find the solution to the doping problem within the sport. As it turned out, the problem could stem from implying a certain behaviour of competing from an early age. We also discovered how the possibility of having a dialogue regarding the topic between the coach and the youth rider exists, but as of now, the coaches do not feel ready to facilitate this dialogue. Our recommendation is therefore to conduct further research into the matter to determine how the parents view the topic, how their relationship towards the coach is in order to find out whether the coach could facilitate a dialogue with the parents or not. This would be done to find out how (or if) it is possible to define or change a belief within the parents regarding the behaviour of <b>their</b> children <b>in</b> the sports. Furthermore, we believe it is possible to create a ‘tool’ of sorts to give the coaches guidelines as a way of facilitating this dialogue. The dialogue would need an intersubjective relation between i. e. a coach and a youth rider to establish the understanding of the topic and thereby creating a sense- making within the youth rider...|$|R

Most references to the Kibei Nisei have focused on <b>their</b> marginalized status <b>in</b> larger society by emphasizing the difficulties that they had in adjusting to American society because of their experiences of being raised and educated <b>in</b> Japan during <b>their</b> childhoods. Particularly, their World War II era experiences of polarizing pressures of identity choice between Japan and the United States have received substantial attention in previous studies. In this paper, the author emphasizes how aspects of their positive marginality developed over the course of their lives. This study relies on life stories of fourteen Okinawan Kibei Nisei elders in Hawai'i who were sent to Okinawa at an early age and retuned to Hawai'i <b>in</b> <b>their</b> mid to <b>late</b> <b>teens.</b> The author collected their life stories through conducting intensive interviews and participating in Okinawan community events and gatherings in Hawai'i over the time period of a year and half from February 2004 to May 2005. Their life stories reveal the following points. First, Okinawan Kibei Nisei generated their stories by selecting unique experiences that they had <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives because of their selfidentification as "Kibei Nisei" and "Uchinanchu" and reconstructed the meaning of these experiences from their present point of view. They gave meaning to their sorrows of their past experiencing Okinawa's poverty, the forced imposition of a standardized Japanese education in Okinawa, and the sense of dual dissonance as both Kibei Nisei and Okinawan immigrants upon returning to Hawai'i. Second, their life stories reveal that over time they came to define themselves in relation to the larger Okinawan community in Hawai'i. As described <b>in</b> <b>their</b> life stories, from the time of their return, the Kibei Nisei bore a sense of responsibility to foster an appreciation of Okinawan culture and pride as Okinawans in Hawai'i, and to challenge discrimination by mainland Japanese immigrants. In addition, the life stories also reveal that their social status within the Okinawan community in Hawai'i rose as an interactive process in the socio-historical development of the Okinawan community in Hawai'i. In this paper, the author treats Okinawan Kibei Nisei as active agents by demonstrating how they reframed their status from being politically, economically and historically marginalized according to the social structure of the society in which they were situated, and were able to establish a positive foundation for their lives, from their unique position to bridge the cultural, social, linguistic and geographical divide...|$|R
