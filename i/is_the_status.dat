5|$|Much of the {{variation}} lies {{in the definition of}} species, and whether closely related taxa are considered separate species or subspecies. Thus, a very wide view of each species, such as Webb's results in few species, while a very narrow view such as that of Fernandes results in a larger number. Another factor <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of hybrids, given natural hybridisation, with a distinction between 'ancient hybrids' and 'recent hybrids'. The term 'ancient hybrid' refers to hybrids found growing over a large area, and therefore now considered as separate species, while 'recent hybrid' refers to solitary plants found amongst their parents, with a more restricted range.|$|E

25|$|Another {{issue of}} {{contention}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of the Russian language. Russian today {{is defined as}} a foreign language by the Law on State Language. Ethnic Russians and other Russian speakers have protested against plans to require 60% of secondary school subjects to be taught in the Latvian language. Some representatives of the Russian-speaking community in Latvia claim discrimination by the country's authorities with these calls frequently supported by Russia.|$|E

25|$|Another longstanding {{point of}} {{contention}} between the Lakota and the United States <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of the Black Hills of South Dakota, which were part of Sioux reservation lands until they were taken without compensation by the US government and opened for gold mining following {{the collapse of the}} Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868). In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court decision United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians awarded $105 million to eight tribes of Sioux Indians as compensation ($17.1 million for the market value of the land in 1877 and $88 million in 5% per annum simple interest between 1877 and 1980), but the court did not award land. The tribal governments of the Lakota have refused the settlement.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the duties}} of the Czech President can be said to be {{ceremonial}} to one degree or another, especially since the President has relatively few powers independent of the will of the Prime Minister. A good example of this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> as {{commander in chief of the}} military. No part of these duties can take place but through the assent of the Prime Minister. In matters of war, he is in every sense merely a figurehead, since the constitution gives all substantive constitutional authority over the use of the armed forces to the parliament. In fact, the only specific thing the constitution allows the president to do with respect to the military is to appoint its generalsbut even this must be done with the signature of the Prime Minister.|$|E

40|$|The {{focal point}} of this study <b>is</b> <b>the</b> social <b>status</b> and <b>the</b> {{political}} <b>status</b> of women in Somalia as depicted in the novels of Nuruddin Farah (1945 -). Based on their roles in the novels, <b>the</b> female characters <b>are</b> classified as <b>the</b> traditional Somali woman who symbolizes what <b>is</b> now <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of women in Somalia; the, transitional Somali. woman who symbolizes what <b>is</b> becoming <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of women in Somalia; the liberated modern Somali woman who symbolizes what should <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of women in Somalia; and the modern Western woman who, because of her Western values and liaisons with Somali males, serves as a contrast to the Somali woman in every classification. The study contends that changes in <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of women in Somalia are related to changing forces in Somali religion, politics and economics, while showing that Farah is justly called a feminist because of his sympathetic treatment of issues raised in African feminism, such as female genital mutilation, forced polygamous marriage, oppression of barren women, and “muledom. 2 ̆...|$|R

2500|$|Amnesty International had {{concerns}} {{about the nature and}} circumstances surrounding Osama bin Laden's death. [...] "We are seeking information from the US and Pakistani authorities about how many people were in the compound {{at the time of the}} operation, what happened to them and specifically what <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> and current whereabouts of the survivors," [...] said Claudio Cordone, Senior Director at Amnesty International. Since he was unarmed, they raised concerns that there was no attempt to capture him alive. While condemning bin Laden for crimes against humanity, Amnesty International stressed the importance of doing so in compliance with international law.|$|E
2500|$|An {{issue of}} {{continuing}} controversy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> and return of Biharis, also called Stranded Pakistanis to Pakistan. Numbered around 540,000, these communities had migrated to what became East Pakistan from the Indian state of Bihar after {{the partition of}} India in 1947. During the liberation war, these communities supported the Pakistani government and later wanted to emigrate to Pakistan, which stalled and hesitated. By 1982 about 127,000 had been repatriated, leaving about 250,000 people still demanding repatriation. In 1985 there was some progress in this area when Pakistani president Zia-ul-Haq agreed to accept the [...] "stranded Pakistanis." [...] In a 2002 visit to Bangladesh, Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf signed numerous bilateral agreements but {{said he could not}} allow the emigration of Biharis to Pakistan for the time being.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{issues related}} to {{differences}} between the structures of rugby union and the Olympics were sorted out before the 2016 Olympic Games. The issue of a combined British team has proven {{less of a problem}} in rugby union. [...] WR chief executive Mike Miller endorsed the concept of a combined British sevens team in 2011 for the 2016 Olympics and beyond. Another issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of Northern Ireland. World Rugby recognises the Irish Rugby Football Union as the sport's governing body for the entire island of Ireland. By contrast, the International Olympic Committee recognises the British Olympic Association as the governing body of the UK Olympic team, while the Olympic Council of Ireland usually fields teams representing all of Ireland in case of sports organised on an all-Ireland basis. Northern Irish sevens players play for the Irish team.|$|E

2500|$|Another ongoing dispute <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of two inter-connected eruvin in Brooklyn: The Flatbush eruv and the Boro Park eruv [...] The Boro Park eruv, {{from its}} initial construction, was not {{accepted}} {{by most of}} the Hasidic community though acceptance there has increased over time and was rejected {{by most of the}} non-Hasidic [...] "Lithuanian yeshiva" [...] communities.
