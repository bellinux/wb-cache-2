The LED <b>indictor</b> driving circuit includes battery charger and discharger (LED driving circuit). In this research, buck converter {{is used as}} a charger, and forward converter with active clamp circuit is adopted as a discharger to drive the LED <b>indictor.</b> Their circuit structures use switch integration technique to simplify them and to form the proposed hybrid converter, which has a less component counts, lighter weight, smaller size, and higher conversion efficiency. Moreover, the proposed hybrid converter uses a perturb-and-observe method to extract the maximum power from PV arrays. Finally, a prototype of an LED <b>indictor</b> driving circuit with output voltage of 10 V and output power of 20 W has been implemented to verify its feasibility.

40|$|To {{solve the}} problem of {{insufficiency}} in microscopic performance of foamed asphalt binder, surface energy theory was utilized to analyze the foaming behavior and wettability of asphalt binder. Based on the surface energy theory, the Wilhelmy plate method and universal sorption device method were employed to measure the surface energy components of asphalt binders and aggregates, respectively. Combined with the traditional evaluation <b>indictor</b> for foamed asphalt, the relationship between the foaming property and surface energy of asphalt binder was analyzed. According to the surface energy components, the wettability of asphalt binder to aggregate was calculated to verify the performance of foamed asphalt mixture. Results indicate that the foaming behavior of asphalt will be influenced by surface energy, which will increase with the decline of surface energy. In addition, the surface energy of asphalt binder significantly influences the wettability of asphalt binder to aggregates. Meanwhile, there is an inversely proportional relationship between surface energy of asphalt binder and wettability. Therefore, it can be demonstrated that surface energy is a good <b>indictor</b> which can be used to evaluate the foaming behavior of the asphalt binder. And it is suggested to choose the asphalt binder with lower surface energy in the process of design of foamed asphalt mixture...|$|E

40|$|In {{consideration}} of rising development of ecotourism in Taiwan and enhancing the inherence of natural resource system in forest-based sites of Taiwan, {{the purpose of}} this study attempted to establish an assessing model of “Selecting Forest-Based Sites for Ecotourism”. It was expected that the model would be applied to develop ecotourism in various natural recreation sites in the future, especially forest-based sites. Analytic Hierachy Process (AHP) was adopted as the major method in establishing the evaluation factors and evaluation <b>indictors</b> of the two-hierarchy assessment model in this syudy. The study first reviewed research papers to choose the suitable evaluation factors. By analyzing, organizing and considering frequency distribution, 31 evaluation factors about selecting a site for ecotourism were obtained. Then a questionnaire survey was conducted. After using factor analysis, six evaluation factors were extracted and they were the components of the first hierarchy in the assessment model. Such as management mechanism, physical environment mechanism, natural resource potential, cultural resource potential, fundamental facility and tourism benefit. Depending on the relationship between hierarchies and AHP's requirement, 20 evaluation <b>indictors</b> were chosen as the secondary hierarchy. 為因應國內生態旅遊之蓬勃發展，及考量台灣森林地區自然資源體系之本土特性，本研究乃嘗試建立一「森林生態旅遊地之評估模式」，期能藉由森林地區應用生態旅遊活動之探討，而提供未來國內各自然旅遊地推展生態旅遊之模式應用。 研究中利用階層分析程序法(AHP) ，建構包括評估因子與評估指標之二層級模式架構。首先由文獻分析彙整中、與專家定量之頻度分析，篩選出 31 項相關於生態旅遊地之評估因子，再利用因素分析獲得層級一，六大類評估因子。依據層級一上下從屬之關係，並考量AHP不大於九個數目之要求，篩檢出 20 項元素以為第二層級之評估指標，由此獲得整體層級體系之建立。依據本研究之資料分析與結果討論，可得下列結論：本研究所建立之「森林生態旅遊地評估模式」主要包括六大類評估因子，即經營體制、實質環境機制、自然資源潛力、人文資源潛力、基礎性設施與旅遊效益等，及其各下屬之 20 項評估指標...|$|R
