40|$|While {{contemporary}} {{approaches to}} SIMD ray tracing typically rely on traversing packets of coherent rays through a binary data structure, we instead <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>of</b> traversing individual rays through a bounding volume hierarchy with a branching factor of 16. Though obviously less efficient than high-performance packet techniques for primary rays, we demonstrate that for less coherent secondary ray distributions {{this approach is}} at least competitive with (and often faster than) typical packet traversal techniques...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>of</b> gasification for energy recovery of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in Brazil. First, {{an overview of the}} Brazilian MSW generation and management {{as well as of the}} gasification technology is presented. In order to figure out the possible composition of the syngas, a BFB gasifier is modelled and simulated using Aspen Plus 8 ®. A sensitivity analysis is performed on the gasifier according to the steam to solid waste ratio; energy and exergy performance parameters are utilized for estimating the efficiency of the gasifier. The produced syngas is supposed to be burnt and used for heat and power production through a Rankine steam cycle in a cogeneration plant. The plant is simulated with a range of representative thermal input found according to the MSW generation. Low-pressure steam is supposed to be used in absorption chillers for chilled water production. First and Second Law efficiency parameters are employed for the evaluation of the cogeneration plant. A thermoeconomic analysis is finally developed in order to allocate the cost of the products using an exergy basis...|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. Corporate {{governance}} {{has become}} {{an important part of}} doing business today, especially {{in the aftermath of the}} massive corporate failures that have occurred in the recent past. Corporate governance legislation and corporate social responsibilities have placed pressure on companies to implement an internal audit function within their organisations. As such boards of directors (boards) have to decide whether they should incur the cost internally by implementing an in-house internal audit function and thereby employing more resources or pay an outsourced service provider to perform this function. This study looks at the fundamental considerations that should be taken into account in determining whether outsourcing the internal audit (IA) function will adequately and effectively address this obligation. Fundamental considerations that should be taken into account in assessing and <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>of</b> outsourcing <b>the</b> IA function were formulated on the basis of the literature review performed. Subsequent to this relevant questions associated with these fundamental considerations were formulated. These questions boards or those charged with corporate governance should be focused on in assessing and <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>of</b> outsourcing <b>the</b> IA function. The fundamental considerations and relevant questions were then analysed by means of semi-structured interviews to access the validity and appropriateness of these fundamental considerations and relevant questions. The study concludes that the fundamental considerations formulated and relevant questions are valid and appropriate in assisting organisations in deciding on the most effective and efficient manner in which to staff their internal audit function and thereby comply with corporate governance legislation and corporate social responsibilities. Most interviewees believed that a degree of co-sourcing or partial outsourcing was the most beneficial practice in general. This is dependent, however, on an evaluation of all the pertinent considerations by each organisation...|$|R

40|$|Protection of Economic Competition - Agreements Distorting Competition The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{agreements}} distorting economic competition, traditionally {{referred to as}} cartels. Cartels are various forms of explicit and implied agreements among participants in economic competition which are capable of affecting the competition {{in a negative way}} and result not only into damaging other competitors, but also mostly into damaging the consumers. The main purpose of this thesis is to present a comprehensive view on the issues of agreements distorting economic competition from the point of the Czech and European substantive legal regulation and take into account some aspects of their practical assessment. Another purpose was to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>of</b> sanctioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prohibited agreements, both public enforcement and private enforcement of claims of the subjects that suffered loss resulting from the agreements. A partial purpose was to suggest possible future regulation of chosen areas. Chapter One is an introduction and includes delimitation of aims of the thesis. Chapter Two deals with the essence of the agreements and the concept itself. It also explains briefly, which particular impacts can these agreements practically have. Chapter Three delimits the boundary between the illegal cartel [...] ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} a pipeline for structure-from-motion (SfM) with mixed camera types, namely omnidirectional and perspective cameras. For {{the steps of}} this pipeline, we propose new approaches or adapt the existing perspective camera methods to make the pipeline effective and automatic. We model our cameras of different types with the sphere camera model. To match feature points, we {{describe a}} preprocessing algorithm which significantly increases scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) matching performance for hybrid image pairs. With this approach, automatic point matching between omnidirectional and perspective images is achieved. We robustly estimate the hybrid fundamental matrix with the obtained point correspondences. We introduce the normalization matrices for lifted coordinates so that normalization and denormalization can be performed linearly for omnidirectional images. We <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>of</b> estimating camera poses in hybrid pairs. A weighting strategy is proposed for iterative linear triangulation which improves the structure estimation accuracy. Following the addition of multiple perspective and omnidirectional images to the structure, we perform sparse bundle adjustment on the estimated structure by adapting it to use the sphere camera model. Demonstrations of the end-to-end multi-view SfM pipeline with the real images of mixed camera types are presented...|$|R

In Distribution System Design (DSD) Problem for CSHR, {{it is critical}} to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>of</b> service stations, which is termed as Service Station Evaluation Problem in Catering Service of High-speed Railway (SSEP-CSHR). As a preparation work for DSD, SSEP-CSHR needs to be solved without detailed information and being accompanied with uncertainty. Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (F-QFD) has been given in the literatures to deal with vagueness in Facility Location Evaluation (FLE). However, SSEP-CSHR that includes identifying and evaluating stations requires not only dealing with the vague nature of assessments but also confirming them. Based on evidence theory, this paper introduces the framework to give the truth of proposition “x is A. ” Then it is incorporated into a two-phase F-QFD with an approximate reasoning to enable the truth of the decisions to be measured. A case study that refers to 85 alternative stations on Chinese high-speed railway will be carried out to verify the proposed method. Analysis shows that the proposed evaluation method enhances scientific credibility of FLE and allows decision makers to express how much is known...|$|R
