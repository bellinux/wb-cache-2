The principal non-linearity {{in the development of the}} socioeconomic systems that are managed under conditions of uncertainty and partial observability of the functioning processes, has helped to formulate the expediency of their forecasting based on neural networks.

40|$|Recently is a "good" {{discussion}} about the labour costs (wages). By the example of agriculture we {{argue that there is}} no straightforward relations between the raise in productivity and wages. The number of labour work and the total costs of labour in agriculture decreased since 1989. The <b>gross</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> (GAP) calculated by the index of agricultural prices (IAP) presents the change in GAP only, not the real value of GAP in CPI. Thus, the productivity per worker and per one SKK of labour costs increased steeply (200  % or 300 %). However, if the calculation of GAP is done by CPI, than the real GAP of 1996 decreased to one third of 1989 GAP. Thus the productivity decreased to 70 % in 1991 - 1992, but recently raised to the quality of 1989. On the other hand, the productivity of labour costs increased to 164 % respecitvely 174 % in comparison to 1989. More-over, the other costs of production decreased to 32 % that of 1989. The productivity of such costs has not changed largely. After decreasing till 1993 it raised to 115 % that of 1989.

Results indicated that the percentages of the area of grassland, woodland, basic farmland and orchard to the total productive land area were 44 %, 22 %, 20 % and 14 % respectively according to this new land use scenario. Based on the datasets of 197 counties in the Loess Plateau, the estimated forage potential would amount to 104 881 028 ton/a (hay), which can raise 104 881 028 productivity sheep unit/ a. According to the unchanged price in 1999, pastoral gross product value would amount to 52 440. 51 million yuan RMB/a, which is as much as 5. 3 times of that in 1999 and exceeds the <b>agricultural</b> <b>gross</b> <b>product</b> in 1999 by 14 %. In addition, there are ca. 59 % of counties whose mean pastoral product value per person would be more than 1 000 yuan RMB/a, while ca. 41 % of counties whose mean pastoral product value per person would be less than 1 000 yuan RMB/a.
