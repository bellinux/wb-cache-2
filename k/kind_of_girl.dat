Mignon has described her as open, honest, outdoor <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl.</b> Stating that like herself Bridget {{had grown up with}} keen interests for climbing trees, cycling and swimming in rivers, non typical female interests. She also branded Bridget as a 'sporty tomboy'. During an interview, Mignon said that Bridget's relationship with Declan changes her and she feels more independent from her family. She also becomes more determined as a person.|$|E
25|$|During 1981 and 1982, Webb {{recorded}} {{her next}} album, I'm Not That <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>Girl,</b> which was eventually released in 1983. Although {{not based on}} a musical, the album had a running story concerning {{a woman who is}} reunited with a former lover. The album culminates with her on the way to their wedding. The songs were composed by David Hentschel and Don Black and were very much in a contemporary pop vein. Phil Collins played drums on the album and Kiki Dee contributed backing vocals. Despite the album's strong pedigree in terms of personnel, it failed to chart and was Webb's final album on the Polydor label.|$|E
500|$|Lexie entertained several {{relationships}} {{throughout her}} time on Grey's Anatomy. In her early appearances, she maintained {{a friendship with}} George O'Malley, until developing romantic feelings towards him. Rhimes offered the insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They’re really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater. At least, that's what Lexie is hoping. She is my <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl.</b> The girl who likes the guy {{because he is a}} GOOD guy and that's what George is. He is a good guy and that's something that Lexie could use now. She's going through her own challenges what with Meredith and losing her own mother and trying to keep things afloat. I’m rooting for Lexie. She's my <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> and I hope that she gets what she deserves: love. And more kisses. There should always be that." [...] Lexie's most significant relationship was with Mark Sloan. Following her death, Rhimes said: ...|$|E

500|$|Gail {{tries to}} use the fact that Kylie gave Max up against her. Lane {{revealed}} {{that it did not}} work because Kylie revealed her past hardships and gained sympathy from David. The scenes also offered viewers the chance to gain a better perspective on who Kylie is and learn about her past. The night before their wedding, Gail unsuccessfully tries to pay Kylie one thousand pounds to leave for good. Lane said that Kylie had the audacity to come back after [...] "£25K for Max" [...] so [...] "£1000 to give up a salon and someone she loves is nothing", though she still keeps the money. Up until this point Kylie had been [...] "playing the game with Gail", but she was not on [...] "Kylie's radar". Kylie then realises how determined Gail is to ruin her wedding. Lane said [...] "Gail has taken a pretty intense disliking to Kylie, so of course Kylie is going to fight her corner—that's the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> she is." ...|$|E
500|$|USA Today writer Steve Jones {{named it}} one of the {{standout}} tracks of the album and commented that [...] "she seems most at ease when she's playing the teasing tart". Talia Kraines of the BBC commented that Spears needed more songs like [...] "Womanizer", saying [...] "Britney 2.0 needs to be full of wild dancefloor driven moves". Simon Price of The Independent commented the song borrows its electronic sound from Goldfrapp. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times complimented Spears' delivery and the lyrics, saying the song is [...] "about the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> power that's focused on besting one obnoxious man, is also [...] and contemporary at the same time– more feminism as individualism". Mike Newmark of PopMatters called the song [...] " [...] a meaty, high-voltage shuffler helmed by the Outsyders, who do an admirable job of recreating the chemistry of Spears and Danja on last year’s single 'Gimme More'".|$|E
500|$|Early in the tour, Vicious {{wandered off}} from his Holiday Inn in Memphis, Tennessee, looking for drugs. He {{was found in a}} {{hospital}} with the words [...] "Gimme a fix" [...] on his chest; he had written them with a marker pen. During a concert in San Antonio, Texas, Vicious called the crowd [...] "a bunch of faggots", before striking an audience member across the head with his bass guitar. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he received simulated oral sex on stage, later declaring [...] "that's the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> I like". Suffering from heroin withdrawal during a show in Dallas, Texas, he spat blood at a woman who had climbed onstage and punched him in the face. He was admitted to hospital later that night to treat various injuries. Offstage he is said to have kicked a female photographer, attacked a security guard, and eventually challenged one of his own bodyguards to a fight—beaten up, he is reported to have exclaimed, [...] "I like you. Now we can be friends." ...|$|E
5000|$|Thomas {{says the}} song's about [...] "the wrong <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> that we've {{probably}} all dated," [...] though as {{a band of}} mostly married men for the last decade, they turned to other sources of inspiration. [...] "Luckily, you have single friends who are making really bad decisions, so you can draw on their experiences," [...] he laughed.|$|R

5000|$|Some Girls {{has been}} {{described}} as: [...] "...a comedy about the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> more usually seen in worrying documentaries about inner city teens." [...] Bernadette Davis has said: [...] "As far as I know, there aren't any other comedies about <b>girls</b> <b>of</b> this age. Inbetweeners has shown what a rich area for comedy this age group is - but girls are very different and I thought they should have their own show." ...|$|R
500|$|McAdams reprised {{her role}} as Irene Adler in the mystery/action-adventure sequel , but the female lead role was played by Noomi Rapace. Joel Silver, the film's producer, has said that [...] "we always {{intended}} {{to have a different}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> for each movie" [...] in the vein of Bond girls. He found it [...] "complicated" [...] to persuade McAdams to return in a smaller role: [...] "She loved being with us, but she hoped to have a bigger role." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal felt [...] "she vanishes all too soon in this overproduced, self-enchanted sequel, and so does the spirit of bright invention that made the previous film such a pleasant surprise." [...] Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post remarked that she [...] "exhibits far more personality and roguish charm in her few moments here than she did in all of the previous film. Freed from the constraints of being the de-facto love interest, McAdams relishes the chance to go full-villain." [...] The film has grossed over $543million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|The {{chorus of}} the song follows, which Madonna {{performs}} in a high-pitched voice: [...] "Don't play the stupid game / Cause I’m a different <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> / Every record sounds the same / You’ve got to step into my world / Give me all your luvin', give me your love / Give me all your love today." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Lanford Beard observed that the song [...] "blends Katy Perry-meets-Gwen Stefani chanting, echoes of Ashlee Simpson's regrettable foray into New Wave-y synth-guitar sounds, and a 'Hold It Against Me' redux breakdown." [...] John Mitchell of MTV News commented that the instrumentation {{of the song}} consists of [...] "glittery synths, marching band drums, claps and a catchy-as-hell chorus." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called the song an [...] "'80s-inspired electro-thumper complete with a cheerleader chant of 'L-U-V Madonna!'" [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin" [...] is written in the key of D major and has a moderately fast tempo of 144 beats per minute. It follows a basic chord progression of D–G–A in the verses, and D–F–C–G in the chorus and intermediate bridge. Madonna's vocals span from the tonal nodes of C4 to A4.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E

There are all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls,</b> and Lottie means no {{more harm than}} Ellen does. She's the kind that can't help attracting; but I always knew that Ellen was attractive, too, if she would only find it out. And I knew {{that as soon as}} {{anything}} worth while took up her mind she would never give that wretch another thought." ...|$|R

5000|$|Some Girls {{has been}} {{described}} as: [...] "...a comedy about the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> more usually seen in worrying documentaries about inner city teens. The series centres around a group of 16/17 year old pupils at a Comprehensive School in London." [...] Davis herself said about the show: [...] "As far as I know, there aren't any other comedies about <b>girls</b> <b>of</b> this age. Inbetweeners has shown what a rich area for comedy this age group is - but girls are very different and I thought they should have their own show." ...|$|R
500|$|Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News praised Kim Possible as [...] "an {{entertaining}} {{show that}} should indeed appeal to tweens, younger kids {{and even their}} parents" [...] that [...] "plays with the superhero format {{in a way that}} doesn't take itself too seriously but doesn't play down to the viewers." [...] Tracy McLoone of PopMatters reviewed, [...] "Kim Possible includes adult-friendly humor, in the event that parents feel the need to watch tv (sic) with their kids. But nobody in or watching the series will ever be offended or over-stimulated, or even surprised." [...] While accepting main character Kim as a positive role model and acknowledging that the series sometimes teaches [...] "good lessons", Besty Wallace of Common Sense Media expressed concern about the show's emphasis on action and violence, explaining, [...] "lessons may get muddled and nearly lost as the heroes shimmy up rope ladders dangling from helicopters and dodge spinning tops of doom. As long as you're not expecting too {{much in the way of}} educational value, you'll probably have plenty of fun with this one." [...] Writing for Bustle, Sarah Freymiller opined, [...] "Ultimately, Kim Possible was just a solid show. It didn't skimp on plot or dialogue in favor of Wile E. Coyote explosions, and its tongue-in-cheek humor allowed it to be self-aware and hip at the same time." [...] Conversely, Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection Among Girls author Lyn Mikel Brown was less receptive towards Kim herself, criticizing the show for promoting the beautiful and thin heroine as [...] "your basic average girl" [...] and apparent reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the fact that her [...] "biggest threat" [...] is Bonnie as opposed to evil. According to Brown, [...] "Being the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> who's accepted or befriended by boys underscores a girl's power and sets her against other girls." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{the book}} Heroism and Gender in War Films (2014), the lyrics of [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] "outline the perfect woman". The phrase [...] "Honor to us all" [...] is {{constantly}} reiterated throughout the song. Its [...] "witty" [...] lyrics are intended to be highly ironic, expressing that a daughter can only honor both herself and her family by marrying, {{as demonstrated by the}} phrase [...] "A girl can bring her family great honor in one way, by striking a good match". Beginning with the line [...] "This is what you give me to work with", the performers then offer an extensive list of examples and qualities required to create an ideal bride, providing both oral and visual examples {{of what it means to}} be a woman, including the lyrics [...] "Wait and see, when we're through, boys will gladly go to war for you" [...] and [...] "With good breeding and a tiny waist you'll bring honor to us all." [...] According to The Criterion: A Journal in English contributor Joshi Aditi, the song also expresses the [...] "inner desire of the male" [...] using the lyrics [...] "Men want girls with good taste, calm, obedient/Who work fast-paced", which is later confirmed in the all-male musical number [...] "A Girl Worth Fighting For". The line [...] "scarier than the undertaker, we are meeting our Matchmaker" [...] appears towards the end of the song. Lyrically, [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] also makes heavy use of the literary device alliteration, as heard during its final verse [...] "Destiny, guard our girls/And our future as it fast unfurls/Please look kindly on these cultured pearls/Each a perfect porcelain doll". Thought Catalog contributor Chelsea Fagan felt that the song's lyrics make it appropriate for single women whose loved ones are constantly pressuring them to pursue romantic relationships despite the fact that they would much rather remain single: [...] "the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> who doesn’t need to be put into a tight-waisted outfit to go find herself a husband and pop out a bunch of sword-wielding sons. You’ve got other plans".|$|E
2500|$|Cindy was {{designed}} by designers Roberto Ferrari and Yusaku Nakaaki, among others. A character crucial to the story and gameplay, Cindy was first introduced in the Episode Duscae demo. Tabata described her as [...] "the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> who {{is very good at}} dealing with men". In response to negative comments about her appearance in player feedback for Episode Duscae, Nakaaki stated she had not been deliberately sexualized, but that the team had perhaps put too much [...] "heart and soul" [...] into her design. They chose to make adjustments so players would be more comfortable with her. Originally, Cindy's breasts jiggled so much that Tabata had to ask the team to tone it down.|$|E

2500|$|The album {{opens with}} the track [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] {{and the track}} has been {{compared}} to artists M.I.A., Daphne & Celeste and The Ting Tings, featuring a [...] "breakdown section" [...] where Roberts raps as well as singing traditional vocals. The second track, [...] "Lucky Day", is a dance-pop song and has gathered comparisons to artists Katy Perry and David Guetta. The 1960s style track lyrically talks about falling in love, with Roberts explaining [...] "The song is about a boy not playing along but in the end you win him over and it's your lucky day. You can take it however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing". Roberts' voice {{has been described as a}} [...] "springy" [...] vibrato, with breathy background vocals featuring sounds effect including repeated kissing noises. The next track, [...] "Yo-Yo", {{has been compared to}} the sound of Kate Bush and described as [...] "wistful", featuring the lyrics [...] "I'm the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> who likes to dream a lot". It opens with an 808 kick drum, and the track [...] "thumps to a dramatic, 50's girlpop pastiche". The [...] "unhinged" [...] choruses featuring explicit words, lyrics such as [...] "Don’t want to be the last to know-oh oh oh", and during the middle-eight of the track the 1950s theme [...] "completely goes out the window" [...] for a classic club mix featuring a drum machine. [...] "Cinderella's Eyes", the fourth track, has been compared to past tracks by Girls Aloud, with a [...] "slomo disco" [...] style where Roberts performs falsetto, suggesting a Kate Bush influence. [...] "Porcelain Heart" [...] is the fifth track, featuring an [...] "eerie twinkle of descending notes". The track has been described as [...] "Italo-disco" [...] with a [...] "single-minded pulse", with Roberts shouting the word [...] "Heart" [...] before the track breaks into a synth section.|$|E

5000|$|Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly took a major {{swipe at}} the group for their overemphasis of Scherzinger as the lead singer. Watson said, [...] "there are two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> groups: those {{anchored}} by a superstar (the Supremes, Destiny's Child), and those made up of charismatic personalities endowed with limited individual gifts (Spice Girls, TLC). The Pussycat Dolls are neither—they're a brand, not a band. This follow-up to 2005's multi-platinum PCD finds lead Doll Nicole Scherzinger in the spotlight, and she's no Beyoncé. As for the others, well...can you name them? Do you even know how many there are?" ...|$|R
