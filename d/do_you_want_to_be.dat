500|$|Senior {{executives}} at publishers Michael Joseph {{and at the}} Sunday Times, which serialised the book, received threatening phone calls and a visit from private investigator Eugene Ingram, {{who worked for the}} Church. Another private investigator, Jarl Grieve Einar Cynewulf, told Sunday Times journalists that he had been offered [...] "large sums of money" [...] to find a link between Miller and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as the Church reportedly believed that the CIA was driving investigations into its tax affairs in the U.S. According to Cynewulf, Miller's mail and phones were intercepted and his home was under constant surveillance. The newspaper reported that Cynewulf had chased its reporter and photographer through the streets of Bristol, armed with a pistol which he fired at them, saying, [...] "You'd better go now unless you want to end up in a wooden box. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> another Hungerford martyr?" ...|$|E
500|$|By May 1999, {{the group}} was nearing {{platinum}} status for Dude Ranch and sales targets were higher for Enema of the State. The Los Angeles Times ran a Sunday feature on the band two days prior to release, noting that [...] "The musicians are sanguine about chances to repeat or exceed the sales of Dude Ranch, noting the always-shifting sands of pop culture and that they've already done better than they'd ever anticipated." [...] Momentum began to build when US radio stations received advance copies of Enema of the State. MCA issued Enema of the State on June 1, and the release peaked at number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album chart was gripped by the Backstreet Boys' Millennium, but Enema of the State still managed to move 109,000 units that week. The band was supporting Lagwagon in Europe when MCA executives phoned the trio about rising record sales. Joey Cape, frontman of Lagwagon, remarked that [...] "They were selling, like, 90,000 records a day [...] I was saying things like, 'What are you doing here? Go home! Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on tour with Lagwagon right now?" [...] At a show shortly following {{the release of the}} album, DeLonge was approached by Noodles from The Offspring to congratulate him. [...] "He looks at me right in the eyes and he goes, 'You're next,'" [...] remembered DeLonge, who blushed and shook off the compliment.|$|E

500|$|Kennedy {{finally decided}} to seek the Democratic {{nomination}} in the 1980 presidential election by launching an unusual, insurgent campaign against the incumbent Carter, {{a member of his}} own party. A midsummer 1978 poll had shown Democrats preferring Kennedy over Carter by a 5-to-3 margin. During spring and summer 1979, as Kennedy deliberated whether to run, Carter was not intimidated despite his 28percent approval rating, saying publicly: [...] "If Kennedy runs, I'll whip his ass." [...] Carter later asserted that Kennedy's constant criticism of his policies was a strong indicator that Kennedy was planning to run for the presidency. Labor unions urged Kennedy to run, as did some Democratic party officials who feared that Carter's unpopularity could result in heavy losses in the 1980 congressional elections. Kennedy decided to run in August 1979, when polls showed him with a 2-to-1 advantage over Carter; Carter's approval rating slipped to 19percent. Kennedy formally announced his campaign on November 7, 1979, at Boston's Faneuil Hall. He had already received substantial negative press from a rambling response to the question [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> President?" [...] during an interview with Roger Mudd of CBS News broadcast a few days earlier. The Iranian hostage crisis, which began on November 4, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which began on December 27, prompted the electorate to rally around the president and allowed Carter to pursue a Rose Garden strategy of staying at the White House, which kept Kennedy's campaign out of the headlines.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1979, Kennedy finally {{announced}} his candidacy {{for the presidency}} when he challenged incumbent President Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination for the 1980 election. On November 4, 1979, CBS broadcast a one-hour television special, presented by Roger Mudd titled Teddy. The program consisted of an interview with Kennedy, interspersed with visual materials. Much of the show was devoted to the Chappaquiddick incident. During the interview, Mudd questioned Kennedy repeatedly about the incident {{and at one point}} directly accused him of lying. During the interview, Kennedy also gave what one author described as an [...] "incoherent and repetitive" [...] answer to the question [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> President?" [...] He called the American-supported Shah of Iran [...] "one of the most violent regimes in the history of mankind." [...] The program inflicted serious political damage on Kennedy. Carter alluded to the Chappaquiddick incident twice in five days, once declaring that he had not [...] "panicked in the crisis." [...] Kennedy lost the Democratic nomination to Carter, who lost the general election to Ronald Reagan in a landslide, but he remained a senator until his death in 2009. He won all seven elections for the US Senate after the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Forty {{minutes into}} the session, Jeane asked Candace [...] "Baby, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> born?" [...] Candace faintly responded [...] "no"; this would {{ultimately}} be her last word. To this, Ponder replied, [...] "Quitter, quitter, quitter, quitter! Quit, quit, quit, quit. She's a quitter!". Jeane Newmaker, who said later she felt rejected by Candace's inability to be reborn, was asked by Watkins to leave the room, in order that Candace would not [...] "pick up on (Jeane's) sorrow". Soon thereafter, Watkins requested the same of McDaniel and Brita St. Clair, leaving only herself and Ponder {{in the room with}} Candace. After talking for five minutes, the two unwrapped Candace and found that she was motionless, blue on the fingertips and lips, and not breathing. Upon seeing this, Watkins declared, [...] "Oh there she is, she's sleeping in her vomit." [...] Whereupon the mother, who had been watching on a monitor in another room, rushed into the room, remarked on Candace's color, and began CPR while Watkins called 9-1-1. When paramedics arrived ten minutes later, McDaniel told them that Candace had been left alone for five minutes during a rebirthing session and was not breathing. The paramedics surmised that Candace had been unconscious and possibly not breathing for some time. Paramedics were able to restore the girl's pulse and she was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Denver; she was declared brain-dead the next day, the consequence of asphyxia.|$|E
2500|$|After {{performing}} Camelot for six months, in July 1961, Burton met producer Walter Wanger {{who asked}} him to replace Stephen Boyd as Mark Antony in director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra. Burton was paid $250,000 for four months work in the film. The gigantic scale of the film's troubled production, Taylor's bouts of illness and fluctuating weight, Burton's off-screen relationship with the actress, (which he gave the sardonic nickname [...] "Le Scandale") all generated enormous publicity; Life magazine proclaimed it the [...] "Most Talked About Movie Ever Made". Fox's future appeared to hinge on what became the most expensive movie ever made until then, with costs reaching almost $40million. During filming, Burton met {{and fell in love}} with Elizabeth Taylor, who was then married to Eddie Fisher. According to Alpert, at their first meeting on the set while posing for their publicity photographs, Burton said, [...] "Has anyone ever told you that you're a very pretty girl?" [...] Taylor later recalled, [...] "I said to myself, Oy gevalt, here's the great lover, the great wit, the great intellectual of Wales, and he comes out with a line like that." [...] Bragg contradicts Alpert by pointing out that Burton could not stand Taylor at first, calling her [...] "Miss Tits" [...] and opined to Mankiewicz, [...] "I expect she shaves"; he saw her simply as another celebrity with no acting talent. All that changed when, in their first scene together, Burton was shaky and forgot his lines, and she soothed and helped him; it was at this instance, according to Taylor, that she fell for him. Soon the affair began in earnest; both Fisher and Sybil were unable to bear it. While Fisher fled the sets for Gstaad, Sybil went first for Céligny and then headed off to London. Olivier, shocked by Burton's affair with Taylor, cabled him: [...] "Make up your mind, dear heart. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a great actor or a household word?". Burton replied [...] "Both".|$|E
