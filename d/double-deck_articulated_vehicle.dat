40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to address the problems}} of modeling, path planning and path following for an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> in a realistic environment and in the presence of multiple obstacles. In greater detail, the problem of the kinematic modeling of an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> is revisited through the proposal of a proper model in which the dimensions and properties of the vehicle can be fully described, rather than considering it as a unit point. Based on this approach, nonlinear and linear error kinematics models are proposed that are also able to account for the effect of the slip angles, a factor that can cause dramatic deterioration in the overall performance of the vehicle. Subsequently, two different concepts for addressing the problem of path following for <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicles</b> are proposed. The first concept is based on a switching model predictive control architecture, which relies on multiple switching linear error dynamics models of the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> to account for the effect of varying the slip angles and cruising speed as well as the mechanical and physical constraints of the vehicle. The second proposed control concept is a novel nonlinear sliding mode controller that introduces continuous sliding surfaces to reduce chattering effects while tracking a reference trajectory. The sliding mode controller is utilized based on the extracted nonlinear error coordinates of the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated through multiple experimental tests on a small scale using a fully realistic <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Finally, in the path planning part of the thesis, artificial potential field and bug algorithms are addressed. More specifically, the potential field path planning algorithm is modified by considering the nonlinear kinematic model of the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> and correspondingly adapting the repulsive and attractive coefficients. In the case of the well-known bug algorithm, a suitable navigation method for an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> for local path planning based on a minimum set of sensors and with decreased complexity for online implementation is also proposed. Furthermore, the performance of the modified potential field method has been experimentally evaluated in multiple path planning scenarios using the previously mentioned small-scale realistic <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Godkänd; 2015; 20150508 (thanay); Nedanstående person kommer att disputera för avläggande av teknologie doktorsexamen.

All these vehicles should have their load floor located as low as possible because the floor placed too high may cause that the total height of the vehicle and the load carried will interfere with the road infrastructure (tunnels, overpasses, electric traction over the roadway, etc.), and the highly located centre of mass negatively affects the stability of motion [3]...|$|R

40|$|In this article, a {{complete}} analysis towards {{the development of}} a switching modeling and control framework for an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle,</b> under the effect of varying slip angles will be presented. The established nonlinear kinematic model, of the nonholonomic <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle,</b> will be transformed into an error dynamics model, which in the sequel will be linearized around multiple nominal slip angle cases. The proposed control architecture will consist of a switching control scheme, based on multiple model predictive controllers, for the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> under varying slip angles. The controllers will be developed in order to improve the performance of the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle's</b> path tracking, while compensating the varying slippage effect. The current measured slip angle is being considered as the switching rule and a corresponding switching control scheme is being defined, being able to apply constraints on the states, the control signal and the output variables. Both the non-slip and slip models will be derived to highlight the significance of accounting for slips in path following control and their significant effect on deteriorating the performance of the overall control scheme when not considered. Multiple simulation results will be presented to prove the efficacy of the overall suggested scheme. Validerad; 2015; Nivå 2; 20141103 (thanay...|$|R

40|$|The braking {{coordination}} between tractor and semitrailer {{is vital to}} the safety of <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Traditional evaluation about braking coordination is based on the pressure measurement along air braking pipeline, which needs to change original braking structure to install gauges and cannot directly reflect the final braking coordination of different wheels. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel dynamic measurement system for evaluating the braking coordination of <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicles.</b> During the brake test, all wheel velocities of the whole <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> are synchronously obtained through a specially designed distributed acquisition platform. To effectively eliminate gross errors and noises in wheel angular velocity data, a 3 -order autoregressive (AR) model and an improved-thresholding wavelet filtering algorithm are developed. Further, a novel direct evaluation method about braking coordination is proposed according to the differences in angular velocity dropping time of all wheels. Finally, the overall system is assessed through real field tests. The results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that dynamic {{responses}} induced by in-motion vehicles on highway bridges are always greater than that of stationary vehicles. Such high dynamic responses would damage both bridge structure and road pavement. This prompts the need to study the causes of high dynamic responses. Many investigations have been conducted to identify the causes of high dynamic responses. Previous investigations show that parameters of both vehicle and bridge will cause high dynamic responses, e. g. road roughness and vehicle suspension. Much {{attention has been paid to}} study the causcs of the high dynamic responses induced by heavy lorries. Two types of vehicle hames are commonly used for heavy lorries, i. e. articulated and rigid. The present study aims to identify whether <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicles</b> or non-articulated vehicles are more bridge-friendly. On purpose of the identification of bridge-friendly vehicles, a comparative study has been made. In the comparative study, identification of the bridge friendly vehicle is made from comparing impact factors induced from both typcs of vehicle running across a medium span bridge with specific vehicle parametcrs covering a wide range of 3 -axle heavy lorries. Results show that dynamic responses induced from the non-articulated vehicle are always greater than that of the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Besides, the non-articulated vehicle would induce high impact factors than the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> As a result, the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> is more bridge-fiiendly than the non-articulated vehicle...|$|R
