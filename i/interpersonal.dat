5|$|A person's {{adjustment}} to cancer depends vitally {{on the support}} of their family and other informal carers, but pain can seriously disrupt such <b>interpersonal</b> relationships, so people with cancer and therapists should consider involving family and other informal carers in expert, quality-controlled psychosocial therapeutic interventions.|$|E
5|$|Although Jevons {{originally}} {{focused on}} the issue of coal, the concept has since been extended to the use of any resource, including, for example, water usage and <b>interpersonal</b> contact. It is perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics.|$|E
5|$|Students will {{undertake}} {{paid employment}} within companies {{relevant to their}} programmes. Students {{will be able to}} develop specific professional competencies in their chosen field, which may lead towards professional advancement. IWSP will also give students the opportunity to develop professional networks and <b>interpersonal</b> skills.|$|E
5|$|Aimed at older {{children}} and teenagers, the programme {{was based on}} the activities of a children's newspaper, the Junior Gazette, produced by pupils from the local comprehensive school. In later series it was depicted as a commercial venture. The show interspersed comedic elements with the dramatic. As well as addressing <b>interpersonal</b> relationships (particularly in the Lynda-Spike story arc), the show tackled issues such as solvent abuse, child abuse and firearms control.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{first began}} {{developing}} Inside Out in 2010, after noticing {{changes in his}} daughter's personality as she grew older. The film's producers consulted numerous psychologists including Dacher Keltner from the University of California, Berkeley, who helped revise the story by emphasizing the neuropsychological findings that human emotions affect <b>interpersonal</b> relationships and can be significantly moderated by them.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his ability}} to {{translate}} what is a complicated treatise into an easily readable and understandable prose for a beginner, Khoo's Sun Tzu series were well received and continue to grow in scope and depth in later years. He additionally manages to add realism by injecting real-life situations culled from his 15 years in management, that provoke much thought and encourage readers to assess their own performance, and take positive measures to become more effective in their workplace and <b>interpersonal</b> relationships.|$|E
5|$|Once filming on {{the movie}} was completed, Berg began to explore {{adapting}} the story for television. Berg later said he had regretted having to jettison many of the <b>interpersonal</b> topics from the book {{because of the time}} constraints of a feature film. Creating a TV series, particularly one based on fictional characters, allowed him to address many of those elements in-depth.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{in eight}} British studios from July to December 1982, with an {{accompanying}} short film {{released in the}} same year, production of The Final Cut was dominated by <b>interpersonal</b> conflict. Although it {{reached the top of}} the UK Albums Chart, the album received mixed reviews. Waters left the band in 1985, and The Final Cut thus remains the last Pink Floyd studio album he worked on.|$|E
5|$|Released in November 1991, Loveless was rumoured to {{have cost}} over £250,000 and {{bankrupt}} Creation Records, claims which Shields has denied. Critical reception to Loveless was almost unanimous with praise although {{the album was}} not a commercial success. It peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart but failed to chart elsewhere internationally. McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation Records soon {{after the release of}} Loveless, due to the album's extensive recording period and <b>interpersonal</b> problems with Shields.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} task which Gaudí faced, not {{in terms}} of the number of works, but in terms of their complexity, required the collaboration of a large number of assistants, artists, architects and craftsmen. Gaudí always led the way, but allowed expression of the individual abilities of all of his collaborators. A test of his expertise both in his field and in <b>interpersonal</b> communication was demonstrated in bringing together a large number of diverse professionals and creating an integrated team.|$|E
5|$|The final segment {{in which}} the cast comes {{together}} is entitled Sharing Stories, where a story is told that explores <b>interpersonal</b> relationships and emotions. The episodes are bookended with a Song of the Week; a pop-style feature song which corresponds with the weekly theme and sets an educational topic for the week's episodes.|$|E
5|$|The strip {{centers on}} the mixed {{marriage}} between a rabbit, Kevin and a grey wolf, Kell Dewclaw. In their society, their major difference is their diet: Kevin is a herbivore and Kell is a carnivore. Their family includes three children: Lindesfarne, a hedgehog adopted from Kevin's first marriage; Rudy, a wolf/fox hybrid born during Kell's first marriage; and their only biological child Coney, a carnivorous rabbit. The comic's plot revolves around species-related humor, satire, and <b>interpersonal</b> conflict.|$|E
5|$|After Sesame Streets first season, {{its critics}} forced its {{producers}} and researchers to address more overtly such affective goals as social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict. These issues were addressed through <b>interpersonal</b> disputes among its Street characters. During the 1980s, the show incorporated the real-life {{experiences of the}} show's cast and crew, including the death of Will Lee (Mr. Hooper) and the pregnancy of Sonia Manzano (Maria) to address affective concerns. In later seasons, Sesame Street addressed real-life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|As medical {{professionals}} become better {{informed about the}} interdependent relationship between physical, emotional, social, and spiritual pain, and the demonstrated benefit to physical pain from alleviation of these other forms of suffering, they may be inclined to question the patient and family about <b>interpersonal</b> relationships. Unless the person has asked for such psychosocial intervention – or at least freely consented to such questioning – {{this would be an}} ethically unjustifiable intrusion into the patient's personal affairs (analogous to providing drugs without the patient's informed consent).|$|E
5|$|Cultura Profética (in English, Prophetic Culture) is a Puerto Rican reggae band {{formed in}} 1996. The band has {{undergone}} several lineup changes, but founding members Willy Rodríguez (bass guitar, vocals), Boris Bilbraut (drums, vocals), Eliut González (guitar), and Omar Silva (guitar, bass guitar) {{have remained in}} the group throughout its history. Despite primarily performing reggae music, Cultura Profética has experimented with genres such as bossa nova, tango, jazz, and salsa. Lyrically, the group discusses socio-political and ecological issues including Latin American identity and environmental concerns, as well as <b>interpersonal</b> relationships and love.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} <b>interpersonal</b> and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E
5|$|Released as the {{follow-up}} to the duo's 1996 album ATLiens, Aquemini expands {{on the previous}} record's outer space-inspired compositions by incorporating live instrumentation. The commercial success of ATLiens allowed for more creative freedom for the group, {{which led to the}} members self-producing the majority of the tracks. The band employed a large number of musicians for the album, who frequently entered and exited the studio throughout the recording process and had a major influence on the writing development of the album's songs. Lyrically, Aquemini explores various themes including human nature, addiction, and <b>interpersonal</b> relationships.|$|E
5|$|The band {{wanted to}} expand on the {{commercial}} success of the 1975 album Fleetwood Mac, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and <b>interpersonal</b> strife among Fleetwood Mac members; these experiences shaped the album's lyrics. Influenced by pop music, the record's tracks were recorded {{using a combination of}} acoustic and electric instruments. The mixing process delayed the completion of Rumours, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release in 1977, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} of Private Practice, a nine-episode American {{television}} series created by Shonda Rhimes, ran from September 26 to December 5, 2007. It {{tells the story}} of Addison Montgomery, a world-class neonatal surgeon, as she adjusts to her move from Seattle to Los Angeles and a new job at Oceanside Wellness Group, a private medical practice. The episodes also focus on the <b>interpersonal</b> relationships between Addison's co-workers, Naomi Bennett, Sam Bennett, Cooper Freedman, Dell Parker, Violet Turner and Pete Wilder, as well as St. Ambrose Hospital chief of staff Charlotte King.|$|E

25|$|<b>Interpersonal</b> {{psychotherapy}} (IPT) is {{a relatively}} brief form of psychotherapy (deriving from both CBT and psychodynamic approaches) that has been increasingly studied and endorsed by guidelines for some conditions. It focuses on the links between mood and social circumstances, helping to build social skills and social support. It aims to foster adaptation to current <b>interpersonal</b> roles and situations.|$|E
25|$|Social {{sharing of}} {{emotions}} {{can be defined}} as an “interpersonal process” wherein, after an emotional event, “individuals will initiate <b>interpersonal</b> behaviours in which discussing this event and their reactions to it is central”. In other words, the social sharing of emotions is the process of reactivating the emotion at a more symbolic level, all taking place as part of ensuing <b>interpersonal</b> interactions.|$|E
25|$|Pacifism may {{be based}} on moral {{principles}} (a deontological view) or pragmatism (a consequentialist view). Principled pacifism holds {{that at some point}} along the spectrum from war to <b>interpersonal</b> physical violence, such violence becomes morally wrong. Pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and <b>interpersonal</b> violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found. Pacifists generally reject theories of Just War.|$|E
