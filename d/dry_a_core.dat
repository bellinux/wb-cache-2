Bacteriol. 83 : 960 – 967. 1962. —Dormant and germinated spores of Bacillus cereus strain terminalis were examined for water properties. Respectively, they exhibited a mean density of 1. 28 and 1. 11 g/ml, a water content of 64. 8 and 73. 0 %, {{and a total}} water uptake of 66. 6 and 75. 6 %, based on spore weight, or 86. 0 and 83. 9 %, based on spore volume. The results confirmed a previous report that internal and external water are in virtually complete equilibrium, but refuted a prevailing hypothesis that heat resistance is attributable to <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> <b>core.</b> <b>A</b> model of spore ultrastructure that evolved from the cumulative results pictures a moist, dense, heteroporous <b>core.</b> <b>A</b> new hypothesis is formulated as an explanation for thermostability in spores and possibly in other instances; it postulates the occurrence of <b>an</b> insolubly gelled <b>core</b> with cross-linking between macromolecules through stable but reversible bonds so as to form a high-polymer matrix with entrapped free water...|$|R

We have investigated fibrillar aggregates of polyglutamine peptides below, at, and above the toxicity limit of around 37 glutamine residues using solid-state NMR and electron microscopy. Experimental data are consistent with <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> fibril <b>core</b> of at least 70 - 80 A in width for all constructs. Solid-state NMR dipolar correlation experiments reveal a largely beta-strand character of all samples and point to tight interdigitation of hydrogen-bonded glutamine side chains from different sheets. Two approximately equally frequent populations of glutamine residues with distinct sets of chemical shifts are found, consistent with local backbone dihedral angles compensating for beta-strand twist or with two distinct sets of side-chain conformations. Peptides comprising 15 glutamine residues are present as single extended beta-strands. Data obtained for longer constructs are most compatible with a superpleated arrangement with individual molecules contributing beta-strands to more than one sheet and an antiparallel assembly of strands within beta-sheets...|$|R

Together, they show the presence of <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> micelle <b>core,</b> with <b>a</b> hydrophobic environment similar to a liquid alkane, a well-defined head-group layer at the interface, and an outer layer of strongly bound bromide counterions. Water molecules penetrate the micelle as far as the innermost head site, adopting a sequence of orientations that is akin to that observed at planar interfaces with vapor or immiscible organic solvents. Water molecules at the exterior of the micelle are highly polarized by the electrical double-layer formed by cationic head-groups and bromide anions, orienting themselves with their dipole vector pointing towards the micelle core...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo study {{weathering}} behavior under water-unsaturated conditions, flow-through dissolution experiments using a porous rhyolite {{were performed}} under both saturated and unsaturated conditions.

The {{proportion of the}} reactive surface area under the unsaturated condition to that under the saturated condition, Auns/As, was 0. 46 after 1 day and increased to 0. 90 in 6 days. Because Auns/As was always greater than water saturation, the surfaces of air- filled pores seemed to be wetted with a water film and dissolved. The water film thickness {{was estimated to be}} 2 – 3 nm. The reason for Auns/As < 1 may be that the flushing efficiency of dissolved elements in the water film was not enough to keep the concentration far from equilibrium, and thereby the dissolution rate in the water film was decreased...|$|R

30|$|The Lucas-Washburn {{equation}} {{is a fundamental}} expression used to describe capillary rise in geologic media {{on the basis of}} pore radius, liquid viscosity, surface tension, contact angle, and time. It is known that a radius value significantly smaller than the main pore radius must be used in the equation in order for the predictions to fit the experimentally measured values. To evaluate this gap between theoretical predictions and experimental data, we conducted several capillary rise experiments using Berea sandstone. First, to investigate conditions in which pores of any size are available for capillary rise, an experiment was conducted using <b>a</b> <b>dried</b> <b>core.</b> Next, to adjust the size distribution of pore water before the capillary rise, gas pressure was applied to <b>a</b> water-saturated <b>core</b> and water was expelled from pores of r[*]>[*] 10  μm; then, capillary rise was initiated. Under this condition, capillary rise occurred only in the pores of r[*]>[*] 10  μm. The same experiment was conducted for r[*]=[*] 3, 1, and 0.36  μm. When narrower pores were made available for capillary rise, the overall rate of rise decreased and approached the rate observed when the sample was dry initially. This observation suggests that the capillary rise in narrow pores plays {{a significant role in the}} overall rate. Based on these results, we propose a conceptual capillary rise model that considers differing radii in branched pores and provide an example of a quantitative description of capillary rise.|$|R
25|$|The {{ruins of}} the city {{remained}} undocumented for around 3,700 years until R. D. Banerji, {{an officer of the}} Archaeological Survey of India, visited the site in 1919–20, identifying the Buddhist stupa (150–500 CE) known to be there and finding a flint scraper which convinced him of the site's antiquity. This led to large-scale excavations of Mohenjo-daro led by Kashinath Narayan Dikshit in 1924–25, and John Marshall in 1925–26. In the 1930s, major excavations were conducted at the site under the leadership of Marshall, D. K. Dikshitar and Ernest Mackay. Further excavations were carried out in 1945 by Ahmad Hasan Dani and Mortimer Wheeler. The last major series of excavations were conducted in 1964 and 1965 by Dr. George F. Dales. After 1965 excavations were banned due to weathering damage to the exposed structures, and the only projects allowed at the site since have been salvage excavations, surface surveys, and conservation projects. However, in the 1980s, German and Italian survey groups led by Dr. Michael Jansen and Dr. Maurizio Tosi used less invasive archeological techniques, such as architectural documentation, surface surveys, and localized probing, to gather further information about Mohenjo-daro. <b>A</b> <b>dry</b> <b>core</b> drilling conducted in 2015 by Pakistan's National Fund for Mohenjo-daro revealed that the site is larger than the unearthed area.|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the final results}} of the XR 2 - 1 boiling water reactor (BWR) metallic melt relocation experiment, conducted at Sandia National Laboratories for the U. S.

The objective of this experiment {{was to investigate the}} material relocation processes and relocation pathways in <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> BWR <b>core</b> following <b>a</b> severe nuclear reactor accident such as an unrecovered station blackout accident. The imposed test conditions (initial thermal state and the melt generation rates) simulated the conditions for the postulated accident scenario and the prototypic design of the lower core test section (in composition and in geometry) ensured that thermal masses and physical flow barriers were modeled adequately. The experiment has shown that, under dry core conditions, the metallic core materials that melt and drain from the upper core regions can drain from the core region entirely without formation of robust coherent blockages in the lower core. Temporary blockages that suspended pools of molten metal later melted, allowing the metals to continue draining downward. The test facility and instrumentation are described in detail.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the Tibetan Plateau on the South Asian monsoon is {{examined}} using a hierarchy of atmospheric general circulation models. During the premonsoon season and monsoon onset (April–June), when westerly winds over the Southern Tibetan Plateau are still strong, the Tibetan Plateau triggers early monsoon rainfall downstream, particularly over the Bay of Bengal and South China. The downstream moist convection is accompanied by strong monsoonal low-level winds. In experiments where the Tibetan Plateau is removed, monsoon onset occurs about a month later, but the monsoon circulation becomes progressively stronger and reaches comparable strength during the mature phase. During the mature and decaying phase of monsoon (July–September), when westerly winds over the Southern Tibetan Plateau almost disappear, monsoon circulation strength is not much affected {{by the presence of}} the Tibetan Plateau. <b>A</b> <b>dry</b> dynamical <b>core</b> with east–west-oriented narrow mountains in the subtropics consistently simulates downstream convergence with background zonal westerlies over the mountain. In a moist atmosphere, the mechanically driven downstream convergence is expected to be associated with significant moisture convergence.
