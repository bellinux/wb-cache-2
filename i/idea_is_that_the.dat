5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E
5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{possible}} explanations {{for the evolution of}} this sexual difference in bill shape. The most widely supported is that it allowed birds of different sexes to utilise different food sources. This divergence may have arisen {{because of a lack of}} competitors in these foraging niches in the North Island forest ecosystems. The other <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ivory-coloured bill, which contrasted sharply with the bird's black plumage, may have been used to attract a mate. In animals that use sexually dimorphic physical traits to attract a mate, the dimorphic feature is often brightly coloured or contrasts with the rest of the body, as with the huia. It has been suggested that as the female was the main provider of food for the chicks by regurgitation, this sex evolved the longer bill to obtain the protein-rich invertebrate diet required for the chicks.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} war time <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> public swap their {{precious metal}} rings for the State air defence's relief ring, made of iron.|$|R
3000|$|In 2008, Bashirov et al., {{among other}} things, {{initiated}} {{a new kind}} of spaces, called multiplicative metric spaces (MMS for short). <b>The</b> main <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> usual triangular inequality was replaced by a ‘multiplicative triangle inequality’ as follows: [...]...|$|R
5|$|Matt Groening {{originally}} pitched <b>the</b> idea <b>that</b> Homer {{would travel}} through time in Time and Punishment. His original <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> time-travel would <b>be</b> {{the result of}} Homer simply jamming {{his hand in the}} toaster, but it was rejected by the other writers.|$|R
25|$|Another <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Viking {{population}} had exceeded the agricultural potential of their homeland. This {{may have been}} true of western Norway, where there were few reserves of land, but it is unlikely the rest of Scandinavia was experiencing famine.|$|E
25|$|In one {{application}} Blowfish's slow key changing {{is actually}} a benefit: the password-hashing method used in OpenBSD uses an algorithm derived from Blowfish that makes use of the slow key schedule; the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> extra computational effort required gives protection against dictionary attacks. See key stretching.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} {{technique used}} above can be greatly extended {{to many other}} types of equations. The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> operator uxx with the zero boundary conditions can be represented {{in terms of its}} eigenvectors. This leads naturally to one of the basic ideas of the spectral theory of linear self-adjoint operators.|$|E
25|$|Nechayev had {{a list of}} 387 {{people who}} were sent 560 parcels of {{leaflets}} for distribution April–August 1869. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> activists would <b>be</b> caught, punished and radicalized. Amongst these people was Vera Zasulich, who got five years exile because of a crudely coded letter sent by Nechayev.|$|R
50|$|He strove in {{building}} modern hospitals, medicine schools and colleges, and successfully built the Dojin hospital and its affiliated medical school. He {{was also a}} supporter of the free press, including journals which satirized him. His <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> freedom of the press is a must to supervise the government.|$|R
2500|$|Two {{papers were}} {{published}} by scientists of the NASA Sea Level Change Team in October 2014 {{in the same}} issue of Nature Climate Change.

25|$|In mathematics, a stiff {{equation}} is a differential equation for which certain numerical methods for solving the equation are numerically unstable, unless the step size {{is taken to}} be extremely small. It has proven difficult to formulate a precise definition of stiffness, but the main <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> equation includes some terms {{that can lead to}} rapid variation in the solution.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} that challenges the co-authorship <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> basic theory of co-authorship was originally hypothesised in the 18th and 19th centuries {{due to a}} distaste {{for the treatment of}} Joan. Critics were uncomfortable attributing such a harsh depiction to Shakespeare, so they embraced the co-authorship theory to 'clear his name', suggesting that he could not have been responsible for the merciless characterization.|$|E
25|$|Alford’s most {{speculative}} <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> King’s Chamber generated {{low frequency}} sound via its ‘airshafts’, the purpose being to re-enact {{the sound of}} the earth splitting open at the time of creation. This theory is an attempt to explain the builders’ use of stacked roofs with enormous granite beams above the chamber’s ceiling. Egyptologists, however, do not see a mystery in these roofs and would therefore reject this as an unnecessary hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 19th century the marginalist {{school of thought}} emerged. This field mainly was started by Stanley Jevons, Carl Menger, and Léon Walras. <b>The</b> key <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> price <b>was</b> set by the most {{expensive}} price, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> price at the margin. This was a substantial change from Adam Smith's thoughts on determining the supply price.|$|R
50|$|As {{the centre}} is {{dedicated}} to the natural elements which were so fundamental to Utzon's work, it <b>is</b> hardly surprising <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> invited to be its architect. Utzon's <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> centre should grow out of nature {{as a response to the}} soul, reflecting silence, tranquillity and contemplation, so difficult to find in today's world.|$|R
25|$|The film {{contains}} a cautionary {{message from the}} aliens. The earliest use of this concept in film was probably in The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), and it had since seen frequent use in science fiction films. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> self-destructive behavior of humanity was the real threat, not any external source of danger.|$|R
25|$|The basic <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> overall binding {{free energy}} can be {{decomposed}} into independent components {{that are known}} to be important for the binding process. Each component reflects a certain kind of free energy alteration during the binding process between a ligand and its target receptor. The Master Equation is the linear combination of these components. According to Gibbs free energy equation, the relation between dissociation equilibrium constant, Kd, and the components of free energy was built.|$|E
25|$|Many Moon-landing {{conspiracy}} theories {{have been put}} forward: claiming either that the landings did not happen and that NASA employees have lied, or that the landings did happen {{but not in the}} way that has been told. Conspiracists have focused on perceived gaps or inconsistencies in the historical record of the missions. The foremost <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> whole manned landing program was a hoax from start to end. Some claim that the technology to send men to the Moon was lacking or that the Van Allen radiation belts, solar flares, solar wind, coronal mass ejections and cosmic rays made such a trip impossible.|$|E
25|$|Another kind of {{production}} involves {{the creation of}} programs {{for the analysis of}} computational systems. In the NKS framework, these themselves should be simple programs, and subject to the same goals and methodology. An extension of this <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> human mind is itself a computational system, and hence providing it with raw data in as effective a way as possible is crucial to research. Wolfram believes that programs and their analysis should be visualized as directly as possible, and exhaustively examined by the thousands or more. Since this new field concerns abstract rules, it can in principle address issues relevant to other fields of science. However, in general Wolfram's idea is that novel ideas and mechanisms can be discovered in the computational universe, where they can be represented in their simplest forms, and then other fields can choose among these discoveries for those they find relevant.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 19th century the marginalist {{school of thought}} emerged. The main innovators of this {{approach}} where Stanley Jevons, Carl Menger, and Léon Walras. <b>The</b> key <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> price <b>was</b> set by the subjective value of a good at the margin. This was a substantial change from Adam Smith's thoughts on determining the supply price.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> European Parliament {{should act}} as a {{constituent}} assembly, although Spinelli was prepared to make compromises {{on the way to}} secure broad majorities behind the process.

25|$|Quatinga Velho is a Brazilian {{village in}} the Quatinga {{district}} of the Mogi das Cruzes municipality, which is becoming well-known because of the basic income-project which is taking place there. The project started 2008 and is organized by the non-profit organization ReCivitas. The funding {{has so far been}} based entirely on private donations. In June 2011 83 people in the village got 30 Brazilian reals per person and month. The organization hopes that all people in the village will eventually get the basic income, and also that similar projects will get going in other villages in and outside Brazil. The organizers are currently building a social bank, so that the basic income in the future can be financed through investments rather than donations. The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bank will operate as an investment bank, but the profit will go to basic income instead of a dividend to shareholders and managers. One plan is to use some of the first revenue to support the basic income project in Otjivero, Namibia, and then to initiate similar projects in different parts of Brazil.|$|E
500|$|The second <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Giant {{dates to}} the time of the Romans in Britain (i.e. Romano-British), because the Giant resembles the [...] Roman god Hercules, who was based on the Greek god Heracles.|$|E
500|$|The third <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Giant is of Celtic origin, {{because it}} is stylistically similar to a Celtic god on a skillet handle found at Hod Hill, Dorset, and dated to around [...] AD 10 to AD 51.|$|E
25|$|Swiss Re's {{low level}} plan met the {{planning}} authority's desire to maintain London's traditional streetscape with its relatively narrow streets. The {{mass of the}} Swiss Re tower was not too imposing. Like Barclays Bank's former City headquarters in Lombard Street, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> passer-by in neighbouring streets would be nearly oblivious to the tower's existence until directly underneath it.|$|R
30|$|After <b>that,</b> a {{challenge}} <b>was</b> posed: {{it consisted of}} a playful activity, a kind of board on which each step involved a different aspect of the planning and creation of <b>the</b> cooperative. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> MBA students should provide advice in each step. For this purpose, they were divided according to their abilities in different areas (production, people management and marketing).|$|R
25|$|The tree-kills {{originally}} were {{attributed to}} a severe drought that affected California in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Another <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> kills <b>were</b> {{the result of a}} pathogen or other biological infestation. However, neither idea explained why all trees in the affected areas were killed regardless of age or health. Then, in March 1990, a U.S. Forest Service Ranger became ill with suffocation symptoms after being in a snow-covered cabin near Horseshoe Lake.|$|R
500|$|Aaron Stewart-Ahn was {{selected}} to direct the video based on his previous work directing the video for Death Cab For Cutie's [...] "Stable Song", as well as work documenting the band's live performances. [...] Stewart-Ahn said that the theme of travel had been inspired by Death Cab for Cutie's earlier song [...] "Transatlanticism", {{as well as his}} own extensive experience traveling solo, adding that [...] "I’ve always felt that travel is a defining human experience that changes you forever, and hope that this depiction of wanderlust, obsessiveness, repetition, and loneliness conveys some of that.” [...] He also said [...] "The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band is performing in an incredibly cold environment while this woman is traveling around the world, moving toward progressively warmer climes. [...] The farther she gets from the song's obsessive protagonist, the more her world opens up, and the less reliable his memories of her become." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} Young Guns, Cantor {{summarized}} Keynesian economics {{with the following}} opinion, [...] "The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government {{can be counted on}} to spend more wisely than the people." ...|$|E
2500|$|The basic <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{automorphism}} j codes the [...] "power set" [...] of our [...] "universe" [...] {{into its}} externally isomorphic copy [...] inside our [...] "universe." [...] The remaining objects not coding subsets {{of the universe}} are treated as urelements.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 TfL {{had wanted}} to bring the Thameslink network into the London Underground network or have the route branded as a London Overground route. This would have meant the network being re-branded. The {{drawback}} to this <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> planned routes to Cambridge, King's Lynn, Ashford (Kent), Littlehampton and Eastbourne would have been abandoned and the improvements would have only benefited London and commuter belt towns within 15 to 20 miles of the city.|$|R
50|$|He {{became a}} full {{professional}} in 1952, {{moving back to}} <b>the</b> NCU so <b>that</b> he could ride {{a new series of}} pro races started at Herne Hill velodrome by a journalist, Johnny Dennis, of <b>The</b> Bicycle. Dennis's <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> experience would help British riders break through on the continent. They competed every other week, individually and in pairs. Bedwell's partner was another Londoner, Derek Buttle. There were more than 20 professional riders in Britain.|$|R
50|$|A similar <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> range-extension trailer {{which is}} {{attached}} only when going on long trips. The trailers {{can either be}} owned or rented only when necessary.|$|R
