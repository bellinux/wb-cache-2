50|$|Fecal {{impaction}} {{and attempts}} at removal can have severe and even lethal effects, {{such as the}} rupture of the colon wall by catheter or an acute angle of the <b>fecaloma</b> (stercoral perforation), followed by septicemia. A small fecalith is one cause of both appendicitis and acute diverticulitis. It may also lead to stercoral perforation, a condition characterized by bowel perforation due to pressure necrosis from a fecal mass or <b>fecaloma.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Fecolith, {{also called}} a <b>fecaloma</b> or faecaloma, {{is an extreme}} form of fecal impaction, often {{characterized}} by calcification. The term fecalith literally means a [...] "stone" [...] made of feces (lith=stone). It is a hardening of feces into lumps of varying size and may occur anywhere in the intestinal tract but is typically found in the colon. It is also called appendicolith when it occurs in the appendix and is sometimes concomitant with appendicitis. They can also obstruct diverticula.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case of a 47 -month-old female {{suffering}} from acute urinary bladder neck obstruction and bilateral hydro-nephrosis secondary to a <b>fecaloma.</b> <b>Fecaloma</b> is defined as an accumulation of inspissated feces in the colon or rectum giving the appearance of an abdominal mass.

Chronic constipation is very common at outpatient clinic. However, acute urinary retention and voiding difficulty caused by <b>fecaloma</b> in the giant Duhamel pouch has never been reported in Korea. We would like to present our case with acute urinary retention due to a <b>fecaloma</b> and suggest that <b>fecaloma</b> might be considered as one of the causes for acute urinary retention, especially in cases with previous Duhamel operation for repair of Hischsprun...|$|E
50|$|Distal or sigmoid, <b>fecalomas</b> {{can often}} be disimpacted {{digitally}} or by a catheter which carries a flow of disimpaction fluid (water or other solvent or lubricant).

50|$|Stercoral {{perforation}} is the perforation or rupture of the intestine's walls by {{its internal}} contents, such as foreign objects, or, more commonly, by hardened feces (<b>fecalomas)</b> which may form in long constipations or other diseases which cause obstruction of transit, such as Chagas disease, Hirschprung's disease, toxic colitis and megacolon.|$|R
25|$|Megacolon is an {{abnormal}} dilation {{of the colon}} (also called the large intestine). The dilation is often accompanied by a paralysis of the peristaltic movements of the bowel. In more extreme cases, the feces consolidate into hard masses inside the colon, called <b>fecalomas</b> (literally, fecal tumor), which can require surgery to be removed.|$|R
40|$|<b>Fecaloma</b> is {{a mass of}} {{hardened}} feces being impacted {{mostly in}} rectum and sigmoid. The most common sites of the <b>fecaloma</b> is the sigmoid colon and the rectum. There are several causes of <b>fecaloma</b> and have been described in association with Hirschsprung’s disease, psychiatric patients, Chagas disease, both inflammatory and neoplastic, and in patients suffering with chronic constipation. Up to now several cases of giant <b>fecaloma</b> {{has been reported in}} the literature most of them presenting with megacolon or urinary retention. We herein report a case of giant <b>fecaloma</b> leading to bowel obstruction who was successfully treated by surgery. A 30 -yrar-old man presented with sign and symptoms of acute bowel obstruction. He underwent exploratory laparotomy and enterotomy. He was found to have a giant <b>fecaloma</b> causing bowel obstruction in the jejunum. He was discharged after the operation with good condition.

40|$|Background: <b>Fecaloma</b> is {{a mass of}} feces {{accumulated}} that is {{much harder}} in consistency than a fecal impactation. The aim of this report is to give {{a brief review of}} this entity and discuss the treatment options for these cases. Case presentation: We present the case of a 12 -year-old boy who developed a <b>fecaloma</b> associated with chronic constipation. This is a rare case on a child which was treated by a sigmoid colectomy after failure of conservative measures of evacuation. Conclusion: <b>Fecaloma</b> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with history of chronic constipation and abdominal mass.

40|$|A <b>fecaloma</b> {{refers to}} a mass of {{accumulated}} feces that is much harder than a mass associated with fecal impaction. Fecalomas are usually found in the rectosigmoid area. A 10 -year-old male with chronic constipation was admitted because of increasing abdominal pain. An abdominal computed tomography scan and a simple abdominal x-ray revealed rapidly evolving mechanical obstruction in the small intestine. Most of the fecalomas are successfully treated by conservative methods such as laxatives, enemas and rectal evacuation. When conservative treatments have failed, surgical intervention may be needed. In this case, an emergency operation was performed and a 4 × 3 × 2. 5 cm <b>fecaloma</b> {{was found in the}} distal ileum. We thus report a case of ileal <b>fecaloma</b> inducing small bowel obstruction in a patient with chronic constipation, who required surgical intervention. When symptoms of acute small intestinal obstruction develop in a patient with chronic constipation, a <b>fecaloma</b> should be considered in differential diagnosis...|$|E
5000|$|As the fecal matter {{gradually}} stagnates and accumulates in the intestine, {{increase in}} volume occurs until the intestine becomes deformed and acquires characteristics {{similar to that}} of a tumor. It may occur in chronic obstruction of stool transit, as in megacolon and chronic constipation. Some diseases, such as Chagas disease, Hirschsprung's disease and others damage the autonomic nervous system in the colon's mucosa (Auerbach's plexus) and may cause extremely large or [...] "giant" [...] <b>fecalomas,</b> which must be surgically removed (disimpaction). Rarely, a fecalith will form around a hairball (Trichobezoar), or other hygroscopic or desiccant nucleus.|$|R
40|$|A 78 -year-old woman {{presented}} to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. Her WBC count was within normal limits, and a physical examination revealed abdominal distention and perianal tenderness. Written {{informed consent was obtained}} from patient for computed tomography (CT). Scout radiography revealed signs of colonic obstruction and fecal impaction in the colon (Figure 1). According to CT, the colon was distended with intraluminal <b>fecalomas,</b> pericolonic/perirectal fat stranding, wall edema and extraluminal bubbles of gas in the rectum, suggesting that perforation had already occurred (Figures 2 a, b). On the 3 -dimensional CT image, densities due to <b>fecalomas</b> were observed (Figure 3). During surgery, focal perforation on the posterior wall of the rectum was found to be consistent with stercoral ulceration. Despite fecal diversion and antibiotic therapy, the patient died secondary to sepsis. Stercoral colitis is an inflammatory colitis that is caused by increased intraluminal pressure from impacted fecal material in the colon. When stercoral colitis is associated with colonic perforation, a 35 % mortality rate has been reported [1]. In approximately 75 % of such cases, ulcers are found in the sigmoid colon or rectum [2]. If stercoral colitis with ulceration is present, focal thickening or pericolonic fat stranding can be observed by CT. The presence of extraluminal gas or an abscess suggests that perforation has already occurred. Surgery should be a last resort for stercoral colitis. If necessary, treatment with surgery usually includes resection of the affected bowel, colostomy and a Hartmann’s pouch. In conclusion, {{it is important to recognize}} this serious condition and begin treatment as soon as possible. Figure 1.

40|$|An 85 -year-old {{man with}} a history of stroke presentedwith a three-day history of bloody stool. He hadchronic {{constipation}} treated with herbal medicine, but the constipation had become worse over the past two months. On physical examination, there was marked tenderness of the lower abdomen and right hemiparesis. The patient’s hemoglo-bin level was reduced at 6. 39 g/L. A plain abdominal radiograph showed large amounts of feces in the colon and rectum. Com-puted tomographic scans of the abdomen showed thickening of the rectal wall (Figure 1) and feces in the colon and rectum. A colonoscopy following gentle rectal irrigation showed several hard <b>fecalomas</b> inside the ascending colon and trans-verse colon, and a large, irregular ulcer with active bleeding from a visible vessel within the ulcer base in the rectum (Fig-ure 2). Endoscopic hemostasis with epinephrine injection was successfully performed. Biopsy specimens taken from the ulcer showed chronic and acute inflammation. The patient wa...|$|R
40|$|Stercoral {{perforation}} of {{the colon}} due to <b>fecaloma</b> is a rare disease and less than 100 cases have been described in the literature. The disease mainly involves the rectosigmoid colon. The condition is correlated with longstanding decubitus, chronic constipation, abuse of laxatives and/or constipating agents (anticholinergics, neuroleptics, etc).

40|$|Background: Colonic {{obstruction}} is {{a relatively}} common condition in emergency care, with a mortality rate of up to 20 %. In 90 % of cases it results from colonic or rectal adenocarcinoma, volvulus, or stenosis secondary to diverticular disease. When fecal impaction is the underlying cause, the condition is usually managed conservatively, but may on occasion become complicated and even require surgical intervention. Based on the proven efficacy of Coca-Cola® to dissolve gastric phytobezoars, we report a case of colonic obstruction secondary to sigmoid <b>fecaloma.</b> Case report: A 58 years old woman arrived at the Emergency Room (ER) with persistent constipation {{for the last six}} days. An abdominal CT scan showed a large fecal mass at the sigmoid colon with retrograde dilated colonic loops. Cleansing enemas and oral lactulose were administered, which failed to resolve the clinical presentation, so we then proceeded to inject Coca-Cola® within the <b>fecaloma</b> using a sclerosing needle, and then washed the <b>fecaloma</b> surface also with Coca-Cola®. After a few minutes we started to fragment the fecalith, the consistency of which had been notably decreased. Discussion: The use of Coca-Cola® for gastric washes in the management of phytobezoars is well established. Since fecaliths are partly composed of these same substances than phytobezoars, the use of Coca-Cola® might well be warranted against them as in our patient, without surgery. Our case report is the second one published in the literature, in which Coca-Cola® helped solve colonic obstruction secondary to <b>fecaloma...</b>|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{elaborate}} {{an animal}} model {{with the objective}} of studying the continence of the biological valves surgically performed in the left colon of rats. METHODS: Thirty four rats were operated on and divided into three groups (G). G 1 (sham) animals which underwent laparotomy only; G 2 (perineal amputation without valves) : animals which underwent amputation of the anal sphincter complex combined with a perineal colostomy; G 3 (abdominoperineal amputation combined with valves) : animals which underwent abdominoperineal amputation combined with three, equidistant and circumferential (360 (0)), extra-mucosal seromyotomies, of the descending colon, which were sutured to create biological valves combined with perineal colostomy. Animals were euthanized in the late postoperative period and surgical valves were saved for histopathological study. RESULTS: Surgical procedure provoked intestinal dilation, as well as segmented chambers along the descending colon. Retained <b>fecalomas</b> between the valves and proximal to them were also noted. Six rats died of intestinal obstruction due to fecal impaction at the surgical site. The sequence of events was: stasis, obstruction, distention, perforation, peritonitis and death. Histopathology showed inflammation due to foreign body type reaction around the sutured colon causing partial concentric stenosis, capable of interfering normal mechanical activity of the distal colon. This process resulted in retardation of the intestinal transit. CONCLUSION: Extra-mucosal seromyotomies, with seromuscular suture, can be used as an operative procedure capable of causing retardation in the intestinal transit of rats...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Chronic {{constipation}} is {{very common}} in elderly patients. As {{a result of this}} situation <b>fecaloma</b> is also frequently seen at these ages. However, the stercoral perforation caused by <b>fecaloma</b> is a rare situation to occur. The rectosigmoid colon is the most affected colonic segment. It is seen in older patients with concomitant diseases and a low quality of life. Presentation of case: Here in this case, we have to report an 83 – year-old male patient who came to the emergency room with complaints of abdominal pain and constipation for two days. He had Type II Diabetes Mellitus, had a cardiac stent and also Alzheimer’s disease. We diagnosed a rectosigmoid perforation due to a large <b>fecaloma.</b> This case presentation was prepared in accordance with the scare checklist guidelines (Agha et al., 2016 [1]). Discussion: Constipation and faecal impaction are common entities, particularly in elderly and bedridden patients. Fecalomas are collections of dehydrated, hardened stool. They rarely can cause colonic ischemia and/or stercoral perforation. Stercoral perforation is the perforation or rupture of the intestine walls by a stercoraceous mass. Stercoral perforation is a very dangerous, life-threatening situation, as well as a surgical emergency, because the spillage of contaminated intestinal contents into the abdominal cavity leads to peritonitis, a rapid bacteremia with many complications. Conclusion: Fecalomas can cause stercoral perforations. This situation can be confused with other causes of acuteabdomen in these patients. Early surgery can be life saving...|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{constipation}} is {{a disorder}} frequently encountered in clinical practice. Here, {{we describe the}} use of ultrasonography as {{a new approach to}} the follow-up of adult patients with functional chronic constipation. Specifically, we report two cases of functional chronic constipation: fecal retention in the rectum and not fecal retention in the rectum. In the not fecal retention in the rectum patient, ultrasonography showed no evidence of fecal retention in the rectum, including no rectal <b>fecaloma,</b> whereas in the fecal retention in the rectum patient, fecal retention in the rectum was clearly recognized. Moreover, ultrasonography can guide the choice of laxative, enema, or appropriate manual maneuver to treat chronic constipation. As a simple and noninvasive method for assessing functional chronic constipation in adults, ultrasonography not only provides important clinical information but can also aid in determining the location of fecal retention...|$|E
40|$|Tubular colonic {{duplication}} presenting {{in adults}} is rare {{and difficult to}} diagnose preoperatively. Only a few cases {{have been reported in}} the literature.

The abdominal-pelvic computed tomography scan showed segmental bowel wall thickening thought to be small bowel, and dilatation with stasis of intraluminal content. The provisional diagnosis was small bowel duplication. She was scheduled for single port laparoscopic resection. However, a T-shaped tubular colonic duplication at sigmoid colon was found intraoperatively. Resection of the large T-shaped tubular colonic duplication containing multiple impacted large <b>fecaloma</b> and primary anastomosis was performed. There was no perioperative complication.

40|$|PURPOSE: Surgical {{treatment}} of chagasic megacolon has suffered innumerable transformations over the years. Poor {{knowledge of the}} disease physiopathology {{is one of the}} reasons. METHODS: From January 1977 to December 2003, 430 patients were submitted to surgical treatment for chagasic megacolon. Of these procedures, 351 were elective and 79 emergency operations carried out at the University Hospital of Ribeirão Preto. Four elective operations, most frequently used, should be singled out: anterior rectosigmoidectomy (52. 71 %), left hemicolectomy (18. 23 %), Duhamel-Haddad operation(15. 95 %), and total colectomy (5. 98 %). From the 79 exploratory laparotomies performed on an emergency basis, 53 (67. 09 %) required intestinal resection. From the 430 patients operated upon, 268 (62. 33 %) progressed without recurrence of intestinal constipation, and 71 (15. 51 %) had a recurrence. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Based on the data collected, left hemicolectomy had the highest constipation recurrence rate compared to other operating procedures; anterior retosigmoidectomy had less complication episodes and a larger recurrence of intestinal constipation in comparison to the Duhamel-Haddad operation. Emergency operations, mainly for the {{treatment of}} volvulus and <b>fecaloma,</b> presented high morbidity and mortality and required extensive intestinal resections, stomas and reoperations...|$|E
40|$|Abdominal {{compartment}} syndrome (ACS) {{is defined as}} an elevated intraabdominal pressure with evidence of organ dysfunction. The majority of published reports of ACS are in neonates with abdominal wall defects and in adults following trauma or burns, but it is poorly described in children. We describe the unusual presentation of an 11 -year-old boy {{with a long history}} of chronic constipation who developed acute ACS requiring resuscitative measures and emergent disimpaction. He presented with a 2 -week history of increasing abdominal pain, nausea, diminished appetite and longstanding encopresis. On exam, he was emaciated with a massively distended abdomen with a palpable <b>fecaloma.</b> Abdominal XR confirmed these findings. Within 24 hours of presentation, he became tachycardic and oliguric with orthostatic hypotension. Following two enemas, he acutely deteriorated with severe hypotension, marked tachycardia, acute respiratory distress, and a declining mental status. Endotracheal intubation, fluid boluses, and vasopressors were commenced, followed by emergent surgical fecal disimpaction. This resulted in rapid improvement in vital signs. He has been thoroughly investigated and no other condition apart from functional constipation has been identified. Although ACS secondary to constipation is extremely unusual, this case illustrates the need to actively treat constipation and what can happen if it is not...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction We {{report a}} very rare case of {{isolated}} hypoganglionosis first diagnosed during early pregnancy, which should be discussed from an obstetric and a gastroenterological point of view. Case presentation A pregnant 18 -year-old Caucasian woman presented at twelve weeks of gestation with lower abdominal pain, mild constipation and a large abdominal mass. Abdominal and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a megarectum and megasigmoid, and our patient was managed with medical therapy during her pregnancy, which occurred without major incidents. At the onset of labor, a <b>fecaloma</b> obstructing the pelvic outlet was detected, which required manual disimpaction. However, during the procedure a sudden continuous fetal bradycardia was detected. An emergency Cesarean section was performed but the fetus suffered hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. One year after the delivery, our patient underwent a sigmoid resection. A histopathological analysis revealed a reduction of nerve cells in the myenteric and submucous plexus, suggesting hypoganglionosis. Conclusion Although there are some reports of pregnancies complicated by megacolon, they are too few and too old to delineate guidelines for clinical orientation. In our article, we discuss several issues regarding the management of these rare intestinal innervation disorders during pregnancy that we believe will enhance their obstetric and gastroenterological management during pregnancy. </p...|$|E

On physical examination, patient had central cyanosis, single second heart sound, A grade III/VI continuous murmur in left clavicular area, abdominal distension and large sized smooth and movable abdominal mass in right upper quadrant of abdomen. Transthoracic echocardiography showed VSDpulmonary atresia and small patent ductus arteriosis. Plain abdominal X Ray showed right sided abdominal mass. Ultra sonography showed a mass lesion in RT upper quadrant of abdomen with diameters of 5 cmX 12 cm that was suggestive of <b>fecaloma.</b> Soap enema was performed and after that abdominal mass disappeared and abdominal distension was improved. Rectal biopsy 5 cm from anal verge showed absence of ganglion cells in the intramural and sub mucosal plexuses. Ten day later, barium enema was performed.

40|$|Introduction: Children with late-presenting Hirschsprung’s disease (HD) are classically {{treated by}} a staged {{operation}} with enterostomy. An alternative may be one-stage laparoscopy-assisted endorectal pull-through, which has cosmetic advantages. This case-series report describes {{the outcomes of}} children with late-presenting HD who underwent this procedure. Presentation of cases: Eight older (> 3 years) children (five males, three females) underwent one-stage laparoscopy-assisted endorectal pull-through in 2010 – 2012. A retrospective review revealed their median age was 9. 9 (range, 3. 4 – 14) years. The transitional zone was rectosigmoid junction in 4 patients, and was rectum in 4 patients. For bowel preparation, five patients required rectal irrigation under general anesthesia. The median operating time was 263  min. There were no intraoperative or early post-operative complications. Patients started a diet a median of 5 days after the operation and were discharged a median of 11. 5 days. During the median follow-up period of 37 months, seven (87. 5 %) had acquired voluntary bowel movements and 12. 5 % had grade 1 soiling. However, five (62. 5 %) of the patients still had constipation. The constipation was manageable with diet or laxatives in four patients but one patient continued to require regular enemas.

40|$|Background: Fecal {{impaction}} (FI) is {{a common}} problem in the elderly and other at-risk groups, such as patients with a neuro-psychiatric disease. It {{has been associated with}} medical problems and high morbi-mortality. A systematic review of this topic might be useful to improve the knowledge in this area and helpful to make an appropriate and early diagnosis. Methods: A PubMed systematic search was performed using relevant keywords. Case reports published in English, Spanish or French till June 2014 were included if they had a diagnosis of FI and a medical complication secondary to it. Each case was classified based on its principal complication. The main objective is to create a classification of FI complications based on published clinical cases. Results: 188 articles met inclusion criteria, comprising 280 clinical cases. Out of the total, 43, 5 % were over 65 years old, 49 % suffered from chronic constipation, 29 % had an underlying neuropsychiatric disease and 15 % were hospitalised or institutionalised. A total of 346 medical complications secondary to FI were collected. They were divided according to gastrointestinal tract involvement and then classified based on their anatomical and pathophysiological mechanism into three groups: Complications secondary to <b>fecaloma</b> effect on the intestinal wall (73. 4 %), on the intestinal lumen (14 %) and on adjacent structures (12. 6 %). Conclusions: FI causes complications that might be fatal. The elderly, underlying neuropsychiatric disease and hospitalised or institutionalised patients integrate the high-risk group in which FI must be suspected. The first FI complications classification is presented to improve the knowledge about this entity...|$|E
