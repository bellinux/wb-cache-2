500|$|Critics {{have also}} accused the UN of bureaucratic inefficiency, waste, and corruption. In 1976, the General Assembly {{established}} the Joint <b>Inspection</b> <b>Unit</b> {{to seek out}} inefficiencies within the UN system. During the 1990s, the US withheld dues citing inefficiency and only started repayment {{on the condition that}} a major reforms initiative was introduced. In 1994, the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) was established by the General Assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog. In 1994, former Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the UN to Somalia Mohamed Sahnoun published [...] "Somalia: The Missed Opportunities", a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in Somalia, showing that, between the start of the Somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the Siad Barre regime in January 1991, the UN missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies; when the UN tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the UN's excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. If radical reform was not undertaken, warned Mohamed Sahnoun, then the UN would continue to respond to such crisis with inept improvisation. In 2004, the UN faced accusations that its recently ended Oil-for-Food Programme—in which Iraq had been allowed to trade oil for basic needs to relieve the pressure of sanctions—had suffered from widespread corruption, including billions of dollars of kickbacks. An independent inquiry created by the UN found that many of its officials had been involved, as well as raising [...] "significant" [...] questions about the role of Kojo Annan, the son of Kofi Annan.|$|E

40|$|Measuring {{productive}} efficiency {{provides information}} on the likely effects of regulatory reform. We present a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) of a sample of 38 vehicle <b>inspection</b> <b>units</b> under a concession regime, between the years 2000 and 2004. The differences in efficiency scores show the potential technical efficiency benefit of introducing some form of incentive regulation or of progressing towards liberalization. We also compute scale efficiency scores, showing that only units in territories with very low population density operate at a sub-optimal scale. Among those that operate at an optimal scale, there are significant differences in size; the largest ones operate in territories with the highest population density. This suggests that {{the introduction of new}} units in the most densely populated territories (a likely effect of some form of liberalization) would not be detrimental in terms of scale efficiency. We also find that <b>inspection</b> <b>units</b> belonging to a large, diversified firm show higher technical efficiency, reflecting economies of scale or scope at the firm level. Finally, we show that between 2002 and 2004, a period of high regulatory uncertainty in the sample’s region, technical change was almost zero. Regulatory reform should take due account of scale and diversification effects, {{while at the same time}} avoiding regulatory uncertainty.

This {{study was conducted to}} measure the level of momentary exposure to X-Ray in operators and personnel working in security gates of Imam Khomeini airport. In this cross-sectional study, the X-Ray machines used in security gates of Imam Khomeini airport are HEIMANN. The radiation was measured in both men’s and women’s <b>inspection</b> <b>units,</b> with curtain down and curtain up when passengers’ luggage coming out of the machine, around the machine, operators’ seat located half a meter and one meter from the machine. The X-Ray was measured using smartlon. The results were analyzed using t-test, and level of X-Ray was compared to occupational standard limit of American conference of governmental industrial hygienists, 25 μsvh- 1. Total mean of X-Ray measured in different positions of HEIMANN machine was 1. 02 μsvh- 1 ± 0. 9032 μsvh- 1.
