For many fusion applications, in particular for surveillance tracking, this enables a user to explore new approaches by exploiting multiple sensor systems. When the link capacity is very low or temporarily unavailable, a common centralized tracking scheme is Track-to-Track Fusion (T 2 TF) [1]. However, T 2 TF neglects valuable <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>LOTs,</b> as track initialization is performed only on local sensor data. Therefore, we address the challenge of TBD and track maintenance (TM) in distributed sensor applications by processing all information available depending on the available bandwidth.|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the industrial and commercial lawn uses of acephate, a watershed was developed with commercial buildings, {{parking lots and}} roads in order to {{evaluate the}} potential loading of acephate to aquatic environments from these types of uses. Because <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>lot</b> sizes and fractions of impervious surfaces were not available, the water shed was set up so that different lot sizes and impervious fractions could be evaluated, and lot size and number which generated the highest EECs was chosen for use in risk assessment. The water shed for this assessment {{was assumed to be}} {{the same size as the}} standard farm pond watershed of 10 ha (100, 000 m 2) and the water body use was the 1 ha standard pond. A 1000 m 2 building was placed <b>on</b> each <b>lot,</b> and it was assumed that half of each lot was parking lot. In addition, a sidewalk was placed around the edge of each lot. Each <b>lot</b> was <b>on</b> its own block with a road grid separating the lots. The watershed was assumed to be square, so the length and width of the water shed was square root of 100, 000 m 2, or 316 m. Roads bordered the whole watershed. Roads were assumed to be 18 m (~ 59 ft) wide. The area of each road is 316 m x 18 m or 5692 m 2. Total area of roads, is the number of roads single road area times the number of roads minus the area of intersections.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Identification of {{predictors}} of outlet strut fracture {{is important for}} recipients of large (≥ 29 mm) 60 -degree Björk-Shiley convexo-concave mitral valves {{when it comes to}} decision making on prophylactic explantation. An association between the manufacturing process of Björk-Shiley convexo-concave valves and the risk of fracture has been suggested. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine which items from the manufacturing records, in addition to known risk factors, were predictive of fracture of large 60 -degree Björk-Shiley convexo-concave mitral valves. Methods: All Dutch recipients (n = 2264) of Björk-Shiley convexo-concave valves were followed up until fracture, death, reoperation, or end of the study (July 1, 1996). Information was abstracted from the manufacturing records of large 60 -degree Björk-Shiley convexo- concave mitral valves (n = 655) in Dutch recipients and included items that described the manufacturing process and items for which an association with strut fracture had been suggested. Manufacturing records were available for 637 valves (97 %), including 25 fractured valves. Results: Multivariate analysis identified age at implantation (hazard ratio 0. 95, 95 % confidence interval 0. 93 - 0. 97), lot size (< 175 valves versus ≥ 175 valves; hazard ratio 6. 6, 95 % confidence interval 2. 2 - 20. 1), number of hook deflection tests performed (0 or 1 versus ≥ 2; hazard ratio 4. 7, 95 % confidence interval 1. 4 - 16. 2), number of disks that were used (1 versus ≥ 2; hazard ratio 5. 9, 95 % confidence interval 1. 9 - 18. 5), and lot fracture percentage (hazard ratio 1. 6, 95 % confidence interval 1. 4 - 1. 8) as independent {{predictors of}} fracture. Although the added predictive value of a model with these 5 variables was sizable compared with a model containing age only, it was only slightly better than a model with age, lot size, and lot fracture percentage. Conclusion: If the serial number of a large 60 -degree Björk-Shiley convexo-concave mitral valve is known, manufacturing information can add significantly to the prediction of fracture. <b>Information</b> <b>on</b> <b>lot</b> size and lot fracture percentage should be made available to clinicians for risk assessment of prophylactic explantation.

40|$|Potato virus Y (PVY) is a {{very serious}} problem {{throughout}} most major seed potato producing states. Seed potato producers in Minnesota and North Dakota were surveyed in early 2005 to assess their perception of the profitability and risks associated with using crop borders to manage PVY in seed lots. Five of the 23 producers responding (a 25 % response rate) said they had used crop borders in 2004. These 23 producers entered 152 seed lots into state seed certification programs. On average, producers had less than 0. 1 seed lots rejected for PVY based on summer inspection. The average number of seed lots rejected in winter trials was 1. 7. Of the 152 seed lots, these producers said they had entered into state seed certification programs, they reported detailed <b>information</b> <b>on</b> 108 <b>lots.</b> Generations 1 and 2 were the most likely generations to be protected by a crop border. Of these 108 seed lots, 104 passed summer inspection for PVY. Seventy-four percent of the 89 lots sent in for the winter test were reported to have passed. The use of crop borders was significant in explaining whether a seed lot had passed the winter test or not. Thirty-one (97 %) of the 32 seed lots that were planted within a crop border passed the winter test while 31 (54 %) of the 57 seed lots that were not planted with a crop border passed the winter test. No relationship was found between the choice of border crop and passing the winter test. Producers also were asked to state their agreement or disagreement with several statements regarding their knowledge and opinions on use of crop borders. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|The {{failure of}} two {{transistors}} in the Altitude Switch Assembly for the Solid Rocket Booster {{followed by two}} additional failures a year later presented a challenge to failure analysts. These devices had successfully worked for many years on numerous missions. There was no history of failures {{with this type of}} device. Extensive checks of the test procedures gave no indication for a source of the cause. The devices were manufactured more than twenty years ago and failure <b>information</b> <b>on</b> this <b>lot</b> date code was not readily available. External visual exam, radiography, PEID, and leak testing were performed with nominal results Electrical testing indicated nearly identical base-emitter and base-collector characteristics (both forward and reverse) with a low resistance short emitter to collector. These characteristics are indicative of a classic failure mechanism called punchthrough. In failure analysis punchthrough refers to an condition where a relatively low voltage pulse causes the device to conduct very hard producing localized areas of thermal runaway or "hot spots". At {{one or more of these}} hot spots, the excessive currents melt the silicon. Heavily doped emitter material diffuses through the base region to the collector forming a diffusion pipe shorting the emitter to base to collector. Upon cooling, an alloy junction forms between the pipe and the base region. Generally, the hot spot (punch-through site) is under the bond and no surface artifact is visible. The devices were delidded and the internal structures were examined microscopically. The gold emitter lead was melted on one device, but others had anomalies in the metallization around the in-tact emitter bonds. The SEM examination confirmed some anomalies to be cosmetic defects while other anomalies were artifacts of the punchthrough site. Subsequent to these analyses, the contractor determined that some irregular testing procedures occurred at the time of the failures heretofore unreported. These testing irregularities involved the use of a breakout box and were the likely cause of the failures. There was no evidence to suggest a generic failure mechanism was responsible for the failure of these transistors...|$|R
