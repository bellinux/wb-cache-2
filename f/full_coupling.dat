The non associated Mohr-Coulomb criterion is used for the description of the behaviour of earth material.

Comparison of the undrained, <b>full</b> <b>coupled</b> and drained analyses shows that the undrained analysis overestimates the natural frequency of the dam and consequently could lead to a miss estimation of its response. The <b>full</b> <b>coupled</b> analysis predicts an important attenuation in the dam response, which could result from the role of the water flow in the dissipation of the seismic energy in addition to the influence of the induced pore-water pressure excess on the reduction of the effective stresses in the dam.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} of the wave induced ship structural vibrations. The presented method is fully integrated in both the linear frequency domain and non-linear time domain seakeeping calculations.

A method based on the <b>full</b> <b>coupling</b> of 3 DFEM structural model and 3 DBEM hydrodynamic model is presented. The choice of the <b>full</b> <b>coupling</b> with the 3 DFEM structural model is necessary due to the particular structural characteristics of the container ships, in particular their open midship section, which is hard to model using non-uniform beam model.

40|$|Mathematical {{models in}} many fields often consist of coupled sub–models, {{each of which}} {{describe}} a different physical process. For many applications, the quantity of interest from these models may be written as a linear functional of {{the solution to the}} governing equations. Mature numerical solution techniques for the individual sub–models often exist. Rather than derive a numerical solution technique for the <b>full</b> <b>coupled</b> model, it is therefore natural to investigate whether these techniques may be used by coupling in a block Gauss–Seidel fashion. In this study, we derive two a posteriori bounds for such linear functionals. These bounds may be used on each Gauss–Seidel iteration to estimate the error in the linear functional computed using the single physics solvers, without actually solving the <b>full,</b> <b>coupled</b> problem. We demonstrate the use of the bound first by using a model problem from linear algebra, and then a linear ordinary differential equation example. We then investigate the effectiveness of the bound using a non–linear coupled fluid–temperature problem. One of the bounds derived is very sharp for most linear functionals considered, allowing us to predict very accurately when to terminate our block Gauss–Seidel iteration.

40|$|We {{explore a}} {{mathematical}} model that couples together a thermomechanically evolving subglacial channel, distributed cavity drainage, and basal sliding along a subglacial flood path fed by a jökulhlaup lake. It allows water transfer between channel and cavities and a migrating subglacial water divide or 'seal' to form between floods. Notably, it accounts for <b>full</b> <b>coupling</b> between the lake and subglacial drainage {{in terms of both}} discharge and pressure, unlike models that neglect the pressure coupling by imposing a known history of lake discharge at the channel inlet. This means that flood hydrographic evolution and its impact on glacier motion are consistently determined by our model. Numerical simulations for a model alpine lake yield stable limit cycles simulating repeating jökulhlaups, with the channel drawing water from the cavities at a varying rate that modulates basal sliding during each flood. A wave of fast sliding propagates down-glacier at flood initiation, followed by deceleration as the growing channel sucks water from the cavities. These behaviours cannot be correctly simulated without the <b>full</b> <b>coupling.</b> We show that the flood's peak discharge, its initiation threshold and the magnitude of the 'fast sliding' wave decrease with the background water supply to the cavities...|$|E
