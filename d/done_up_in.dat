25|$|Name had met Warhol fleetingly at Serendipity 3, {{where he}} was a waiter, and then later again through Ray Johnson, who brought Name to an event at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Johnson had {{attended}} Black Mountain College in the 1940s and the younger Linich was a fan of that circle's pre-Beat, zen way of interacting with the world. Name met Warhol again when the collagist, pre-Pop and graphic artist Johnson brought Andy to one of Linich's haircutting parties in his East Village apartment and Warhol saw the place <b>done</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> silver foil and paint.|$|E
500|$|In October 1957 Palewski was {{appointed}} as France's ambassador to Italy. Mitford's meetings with him, {{which had become}} increasingly rare because of [...] his many political and social commitments, were now reduced to a single visit a year, supplemented with occasional letters. [...] Mitford mainly concealed her true feelings on this separation, although one acquaintance noted her increasingly [...] "savage" [...] teasing of friends, which was perhaps a safety valve: [...] "If she would only tell one she is unhappy one would do what one could to comfort her". In March 1958 Mitford's father, Lord Redesdale, died. After the cremation, she informed her sister Jessica, [...] "the ashes were <b>done</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the sort of parcel he used to bring back from London, rich thick brown paper & incredibly neat knots".|$|E
500|$|Lewis first {{ran for the}} CCF in the 1940 federal {{election}} in York West. [...] He placed a distant third, receiving 8,330 fewer votes than the second-place Liberal candidate, Chris J. Bennett. [...] Despite his poor showing in his first election, the party asked Lewis {{to run in the}} 1943 by-election in the Montreal, Quebec, federal riding of Cartier, made vacant by the death of Peter Bercovitch. Lewis' opponents included Fred Rose of the communist Labor–Progressive Party. It was a vicious campaign, immortalized by A.M. Klein in an uncompleted novel called Come the Revolution. [...] The novel was broadcast in the 1980s on Lister Sinclair's Ideas programme on CBC Radio One. [...] If the Communist rhetoric could be believed, [...] "Lewis was a Fascist <b>done</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> brown." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{may have}} got a wrong {{impression}} from our talk," [...] added Jake Tate. [...] "We handle things in a rougher way down in this oil country than you <b>do</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> New York. Davenport will straighten out everything with your father." ...|$|R
500|$|City of Honolulu was rebuilt to [...] and had {{accommodations}} for around 450first-class and 50third-class passengers. Her hull was painted all white for [...] service, and she sported period designs in her common areas. The dining room, {{large enough to}} seat 300 in a single sitting, was decorated in a Grecian theme, and featured 18stained glass windows designed by San Diego architect Carleton Winslow. The smoking room was <b>done</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a Tudor style; the music room was decorated in a combined French and Italian Renaissance manner; and the writing room was in Adam style. The suites were all done in either Adam, Queen Anne, or Louis XVI styles. The ship featured six passenger elevators, and a swimming pool patterned on a Pompeian design. One {{of the few remaining}} traces of her pre-war German decoration was the rosewood railing on her grand staircase.|$|E

2500|$|The brick tea is {{packaged}} [...] {{either in}} the courtyard or in the street outside, and {{it is quite a}} complicated process. When the coolies bring it in from Ya'an, it has to be repacked before being consigned upcountry, for in a coolie's load the standard subunit is four bricks lashed together, and these would be the wrong shape for animal transport. So they are first cut in two, then put together in lots of three, leaving what they call a gam, which is half a yak's load. Tea {{which is going to be}} consumed reasonably soon is <b>done</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a loose case of matting, but the gams, which are bound for remote destinations, perhaps even for Lhasa, are sewn up in yakhides. These hides are not tanned but are merely dried in the sun; when used for packing they are soaked in water to make them pliable and then sewn very tightly around the load, and when they dry out again the tea is enclosed in a container which is as hard as wood and is completely unaffected by rain, hard knocks, or immersion in streams. The Tibetan packers are a special guild of craftsmen, readily identifiable by the powerful aroma of untanned leather which they exude.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou wouldst wish to {{know what}} I was <b>doing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> that forked tree?" [...] he asked her with calm dignity after a while, when the hedges of the flower garden came in sight. [...] "I was making a home for thee, {{according}} to the commands of the Lord." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, upon my honour," [...] he said, {{looking out}} of the window into the Montpelier Gardens, [...] "a very nice {{situation}} indeed. How much better they do these things in such a place as this than we <b>do</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> London! What dingy houses we live in, and how bright they make the places here!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, papa, do {{tell me what}} it is; I know it {{is about}} the hospital, and what they are <b>doing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> London, and what that cruel {{newspaper}} has said; but if there be such cause for sorrow, let us be sorrowful together; we are all in all to each other now: dear, dear papa, do speak to me." ...|$|R
