500|$|Mr. McClure tried {{three men}} on this disagreeable task, {{but none of}} them did it very well, so a month ago it was thrust upon me. You may imagine me {{wandering}} around the country grubbing among newspaper files and court records for the next five months. It is the most laborious and sordid work I have ever come upon, and it takes every hour of my time and as much vitality as I can put into it. ... You can't know, never having done it, how such work does sap your poor brain and wring it dry of anything you'd like to pretend was there. I jump about like a squirrel in a cage and wonder how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> and why I am doing it. I never in my life wanted to do this sort of thing. I have a clean conscience on that score. Then why am I hammering away at it, I'd like to know? I often wonder whether I shall ever write another line of anything I care to.|$|E
500|$|The Molloy {{character}} {{is based on}} actor David Niven's performance as the character A. J. Raffles, a gentleman thief, in the 1939 film Raffles. The music heard {{at the beginning of}} the episode during the burglaries is taken from the film The Pink Panther, in which Niven played The Phantom, a similar character. Flanders tells Homer that his Shroud of Turin beach towels were stolen during one of the burglaries. Apu protects the Kwik-E mart with a rifle in a way similar to many of the images of Korean Grocery store owners during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.] Homer's dream of riding a nuclear bomb into oblivion is a reference to the famous scene from the film [...] Homer's line [...] "So I said, Look buddy, your car was upside-down when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here.</b> And as for your grandmother, she shouldn't have mouthed off like that!" [...] is a reference to Flannery O'Connor's short story [...] "A Good Man Is Hard to Find". The scene of Homer and Principal Skinner talking in front of the museum is a reference to a scene from the television series Dragnet. In a reference to the plot of the 1963 film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Molloy sends the residents of Springfield on a hunt for a treasure that is buried under a big letter. The ending sequence of the episode also references the film by using the same music and camera angles. In another scene that references It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Bart tricks American actor Phil Silvers into driving his car into a river, just like Silvers's character did in the film.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Tao Ruspoli, Cockburn said, [...] "No doubt about it, since <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> in the early 70s things have gone downhill. The Left is in terrible shape. What's the leading obsession of the Left right now? This whole, I think, mad idea that Bush and Cheney organised {{the attack on the}} World Trade Towers. I think it's absolutely insane. I think [...] are capable of monstrous evil, I just think the theories they have - of no plane hitting the Pentagon - is nutty. It's like flying saucers." [...] He noted that his friend Chuck Spinney had a friend on the plane who was later identified by his dental records because his teeth were found inside the Pentagon. Cockburn writes in standard incisive wit [...] "This doesn’t faze the conspiracists. They’re immune to any reality check. Spinney “worked for the government.” They switched the dental records. The Boeing 757 was flown to Nebraska for a rendez-vous with President Bush, who shot the passengers, burned the bodies on the tarmac and gave Spinney’s friend’s teeth to Dick Cheney to drop through a hole in his trousers amid the debris in the Pentagon." ...|$|E

60|$|ANNA--[Acutely embarrassed in her turn.] Hello--father. She {{told me it}} was you. <b>I</b> yust <b>got</b> <b>here</b> {{a little}} while ago.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No; I {{suppose they}} would call it money under false pretences. I only ran dark; it was a girl <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>here</b> with me that did the trick.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> {{my first}} glimpse of the {{wonderful}} perfection of the German railway system.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pard Wils, I'm not reboundin' {{as natural}} as I'd like. I reckon I've lived some years before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> an' a {{lifetime}} since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I. Never {{was here}} before. I've only a vague {{idea of how}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> and mustn't go far with you lest I lose myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everywhere," [...] said Bob, [...] "up {{and down}} the street, all through the hotel. I asked Lem Hallowell, and he didn't know where you were. <b>I</b> only <b>got</b> <b>here</b> last night myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no money, but <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>here</b> what is {{fine and}} jolly. It is yours." [...] And he {{handed over the}} {{contents}} of the precious tin can he had brought with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{put into}} the upper story {{of one of their}} houses but, after ten days, my wounds healed {{sufficiently}} to allow me to walk; and <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>here</b> without any serious adventure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} think so," [...] she replied. [...] "Seems to me I've had {{nothing else to}} do since <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> but buy frocks and things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw them," [...] Charnock {{answered}} with a languid hint of meaning. [...] "Didn't {{want to join the}} procession and thought they might load up my rig if <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> on time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{have you}} know," [...] said the visitor, with lofty dignity, [...] "that {{my name is}} Mrs. Robinson, {{and if you want}} to know how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> I came in a kerridge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Miss Clack, I {{have been}} only waiting to see you! Chance set me free of my London engagements to-day sooner than I had expected, and <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> in consequence, earlier than my {{appointed}} time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet; {{remember}} that <b>I</b> only <b>got</b> <b>here</b> last night." [...] She appeared to herself ignobly weak. [...] "I {{had had no}} idea what she was doing; I was taken completely by surprise. She managed it wonderfully." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{me about}} your wife, Alderling," [...] I said, and he {{answered}} {{with a sort of}} scream, [...] "I wanted you to ask me! Why didn't you ask me before? What did you suppose <b>I</b> <b>got</b> you <b>here</b> for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know how}} tired I was till <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here.</b> Gee," [...] he said, boyishly, [...] "that door-knob {{at the back}} of my head is red-hot! You're good to me," [...] he added, humbly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh!" [...] Mr. Pike muttered gruffly, {{while we}} were exclaiming over our fresh discovery. [...] "Look at the sunset <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> to the north. It ain't doing so badly now, I leave it to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Worn {{out as he}} was, {{the doctor}} noticed the grimness of his tone. [...] "The nearer the better," [...] he said. [...] "I don't quite know how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> but you {{scarcely}} seem at ease." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} didn't {{expect to see}} me," [...] he said; [...] "I've but just arrived. Literally, <b>I</b> only <b>got</b> <b>here</b> this evening. You see I've lost no time in coming to pay you my respects. I knew you were at home on Thursdays." ...|$|R
6000|$|YANK--Yuh call me? Well, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> noive, too! <b>Here's</b> my hand. Yuh wanter blow tings up, don't yuh? Well, dat's me! I belong! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The blind; it {{is quite}} up. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> it was half down, then someone pulled it up. That's what {{finished}} me. I felt as though I had been hit {{on the head with}} a stick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything shockingly exaggerated, of course," [...] she declared. [...] "I {{have really}} been plagued to death since <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> with interviewers, {{and that sort of}} person. I wonder if you know how glad I am to see you again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right, Mr. Lake," [...] he said. [...] "You {{just keep}} right on staying there. I'm {{coming back to}} drain you--if that hoodoo doesn't catch me. I don't know how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> but I'll know by the way I go out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Regular? There's no law in Marco. We've got to {{make our}} own laws. Let it {{be a matter of}} conscience. Boys, this man Hardman ruined my father. I heard that from a {{reliable}} source at Littleton before <b>I</b> ever <b>got</b> <b>here.</b> Don't you think it honest for Dad to take this money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I think he'll {{get over}} his bashfulness, {{and so will}} some of the others," [...] {{answered}} Songbird Powell. [...] "And {{let me tell you}} one thing--when <b>I</b> first <b>got</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> thought the men were a pretty rough crowd, but the more I get to know them, the more I'm satisfied they're all right at heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a {{long ways}} down, and had one bad tumble, too, in a dirty little gully; {{and it was pretty}} nigh day when I turned to come back. An' then when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up <b>here</b> <b>I</b> thought I would look fur John Walker's boat--fur I knew he kept it tied up somewhere down this way--and save myself all that walk. I found the ole boat--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sartain--I want {{no better}} title. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> first, and tuck up the land, and shall {{continue}} to tuck it up, as I want it. There's no use in being mealy-mouthed, for I {{like to speak}} out, though the landlord's son be by!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Madame Munster {{looked at}} him again; and then, smiling: [...] "And I have {{certainly}} had time, since <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> to ask myself why I came. However, I never ask myself idle questions. Here I am, {{and it seems to}} me you ought only to thank me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You did {{not expect}} me perhaps--wonder how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here!</b> Jakes let me in; he has got a proper respect for marital rights, has Jakes. You looked so pretty, I could not {{make up my mind}} to disturb you. Quite a romantic meeting, is it not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'By such toilsome labour as this <b>I</b> <b>got</b> him <b>here</b> as my steward. And I {{wanted to}} see him your husband, Cytherea!--the husband of my true lover's child. It was a sweet dream to me.... Pity me--O, pity me! To die unloved is more than I can bear! I loved your father, and I love him now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is he coming out?" [...] {{demanded the}} terrible voice, [...] "or have <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to wait <b>here</b> all night? Why don’t he come outside, and I’ll break every {{bone in his}} body." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sanborn's laugh had an odd little quaver. [...] "Why, {{so far as}} I know, I guess it's all right. Damn queer, though. <b>I</b> wish we'd <b>got</b> <b>here</b> in daytime.... But {{maybe that}} wouldn't help." ...|$|R
