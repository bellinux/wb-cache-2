5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} moved into dark skies, {{and although it}} faded as it receded from the Sun it remained {{one of the most}} prominent objects in the sky. On 30 September, observers, including Finlay and E. E. Barnard, began to notice that the comet's nucleus was elongated and broken into two pronounced bright balls of light, and by 17 October it was clear that it had broken into at least five fragments. Observers reported that the relative brightness of the fragments varied <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|Horses {{and other}} members of the genus Equus are adapted by {{evolutionary}} biology to eating small amounts of the same kind of food all day long. In the wild, horses ate prairie grasses in semi-arid regions and traveled significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition. Therefore, their digestive system was made to work best with a small but steady flow of food that does not change much <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{proclamation}} of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial {{institutions like the}} Force Publique to function <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day,</b> and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.|$|E
5|$|In {{the time}} that Gates was there, {{research}} focused mainly on honey production, brood diseases, wax extraction and horticultural pollination in the cucumber and cranberry industries. From 1913 to 1920 the laboratory was also operated by a superintendent, John L. Byard, hired on by Gates to maintain the facilities <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day</b> as well as perform wax extractions and other services to beekeepers from around the state. Following Gates' resignation in 1918, the school ceased to offer its summer beekeeping school, many of its state extension services, and the college went through several different professors before hiring Frank R. Shaw as the new professor of beekeeping in 1931. With Shaw's retirement in 1969, the laboratory was rededicated to urban and medical entomology research, with the former beekeeping program falling into relative obscurity.|$|E

Forces of 20 g, 50 g or 100 g were delivered to the left maxillary first molars of fifteen 10 -week-old rats for 14 days. Each rat was subjected to micro-computed tomography scanning at 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 28 and 42 days after force removal. The root resorption crater volume, tooth movement relapse and alveolar bone microarchitecture were measured at each time point. <b>From</b> <b>day</b> 3 <b>to</b> <b>day</b> 14, the root resorption volume decreased significantly in each group. In the 20 -g force group, the root resorption volume gradually stabilized after 14 days, whereas in the 50 -g and 100 -g force groups, it stabilized after 28 days. In all groups, tooth movement relapsed significantly <b>from</b> <b>day</b> 0 <b>to</b> <b>day</b> 14 and then remained stable. <b>From</b> <b>day</b> 3 <b>to</b> <b>day</b> 10, the 20 -g group exhibited faster relapse than the 50 -g and 100 -g groups.

5|$|Jupiter {{demonstrates}} bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, {{which are}} transient and only occur {{at times of}} heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day.</b> They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (less than 1000km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles; the satellites' auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter's ionosphere with those of its largest moons, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals. Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost {{all parts of the}} electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3keV), they are brightest in the mid-infrared (wavelength 3–4μm and 7–14μm) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions (wavelength 80–180nm).|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day.</b> In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E
5|$|The East Riding {{generally}} has cool summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day</b> {{as well as}} from season to season. The latitude of the area means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing with them unsettled and windy weather, particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fair weather. In winter, anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought, particularly on the Wolds. For its latitude this area is mild in winter and cooler in summer due to the influence of the Gulf Stream in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Air temperature varies on a daily and seasonal basis. The temperature is usually lower at night, and January is the coldest time of the year. The two dominant influences on the climate of the area are the shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the Pennines and the proximity of the North Sea.|$|E

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{feeding experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine growth and survival of milkfish larvae reared on various feeding regimes involving the use of artificial diets. Two larval diets (Feed A and Feed B) containing 45 % protein and 10 % lipid were fed either alone or in combination with Brachionus <b>from</b> <b>day</b> 8 <b>to</b> <b>day</b> 21. The feed in the control treatment were Brachionus (10 ind/ml) <b>from</b> <b>day</b> 8 <b>to</b> <b>day</b> 14 and Artemia (2 - 3 ind/ml) <b>from</b> <b>day</b> 15 <b>to</b> <b>day</b> 21.

No significant differences were observed in survival rates, total length, wet weight and dry weight among fish fed combination of Brachionus and Feed B and the control feed (Brachionus and Artemia). These promising results indicate {{the possibility of using}} Feed B as partial replacement or supplement to live food. However, lowest survival rates, total length, and weight were obtained in fish fed either Feed A or Feed B alone, indicating that the test artificial diets given solely <b>to</b> milkfish larvae starting <b>from</b> <b>day</b> 8 can not support good growth and survival. Further studies on the development of improved artificial diets for larval milkfish need to be done...|$|R

The results showed that feed time would also influence uridine’s effects. Feeding uridine in late phase was more beneficial on charge heterogeneity, which made basic species better controlled (Fig. S 4 in Additional file 5). In conclusion, uridine’s effects on cell growth and charge variants were related with its feed strategy, and these findings can provide more choices for process optimization.|$|R
5|$|The area {{generally}} has warm summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day</b> {{as well as}} from season to season. Its latitude means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing unsettled and windy weather particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fine weather. In winter anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought. The two dominant influences on the climate of the Whitby area are shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the North York Moors and the proximity of the North Sea. Late, chilly springs and warm summers are a feature of the area but there are often spells of fine autumn weather. Onshore winds in spring and early summer bring mists or low stratus clouds (known locally as sea frets) to the coast and moors.|$|E

Methionine synthase was present in all tissues from the first gestational day investigated and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase was present in all tissues throughout the neurulating period. Our {{results indicate that the}} homocysteine—methionine cycle, which is crucial to transmethylation reactions, is functional during the neurulating period in embryonic tissue. Owing to the absence of cystathionine-ß-synthase at this stage of development in embryonic tissue, the homocysteinyl moiety is conserved in the homocysteine—methionine cycle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} the role of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in chronic pain including thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. Chronic inflammatory nociception of rats was produced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and data was collected until day 28 following injection. Results Thermal hyperalgesia was evident <b>from</b> <b>day</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>day</b> 28 with peak at day 7, while mechanical allodynia persisted <b>from</b> <b>day</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>day</b> 14 and was greatest at day 7. Intrathecal administration of AMG 9810 at day 7, a selective TRPV 1 antagonist, significantly reduced thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. TRPV 1 expression in DRG detected by Western blotting was increased relative to baseline throughout the observation period. Double labeling of TRPV 1 with neuronal marker neurofilament 200 (NF 200), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or isolectin B 4 (IB 4) was used to distinguish different subtypes of DRG neurons. TRPV 1 expression was increased in the medium-sized myelinated A fiber (NF 200 positive) neurons and in small non-peptidergic (IB 4 positive) neurons <b>from</b> <b>day</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>day</b> 14 and was increased in small peptidergic (CGRP positive) neurons <b>from</b> <b>day</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>day</b> 28.
