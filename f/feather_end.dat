50|$|Feather {{shuttles}} need to {{be properly}} humidified for at least 4 hours prior to play in order to fly the correct distance at the proper speed and to last longer. Properly humidified feathers flex during play, enhancing the shuttle's speed change and durability. Dry feathers are brittle and break easily, causing the shuttle to wobble. Saturated feathers are 'mushy', making the feather cone narrow too much when strongly hit, which causes the shuttle to fly overly far and fast. Humidification boxes are often used, but a simple moist sponge inserted in the <b>feather</b> <b>end</b> of the closed shuttle tube will work nicely. Water should never touch the cork of the shuttle. Shuttles are tested prior to play {{to make sure they}} fly true and at the proper speed, and cover the proper distance. Different weights of shuttles are used to compensate for local atmospheric conditions. Both humidity and height above sea level affect shuttle flight. A proper shuttle will generally travel from the back line of the court to just short of the long doubles service line {{on the opposite side of}} the net, with a full underhand hit from an average player.|$|E

The <b>feather</b> <b>end</b> had been cut off below the pith, right where the hollow trunk begins, and into this delicate, translucent receptacle the scale gold had been poured.

The newcomer seated himself, hitched his sword-belt round {{so that he could}} lean both hands upon the hilt, and sat, stiff and immovable, awaiting the Lord Seneschal's pleasure. From his desk across the room the secretary, idly chewing the <b>feathered</b> <b>end</b> of his goose-quill, took silent stock of the man from Paris, and wondered.|$|R
50|$|The dinosaur's tail is {{long and}} <b>feathered,</b> with <b>end</b> <b>feathers</b> up to 30 cm long, equalling {{approximately}} 30% {{of the length of}} the animal's skeleton. This length exceeds the previous record length of 7 in for feathers from non-avian dinosaurs. The elongated tail feathers are thought to have helped provide softer and safer landings. They could have controlled pitch, a feature useful for a heavier animal, that would have attained a faster gliding speed.|$|R

The cross, a heraldic device, and utilized by the Indians in Oklahoma, is {{symbolic of the}} morning star and {{is representative of the}} dawn of the 14th Field Artillery. The fourteen drops of water correspond to the numerical designation of the regiment. The irregular placement of the drops is to represent a dried peyote, a species of small cactus, one of the sacred emblems of the Comanche and Kiowa Indians. The war bonnet pierced by the arrow of Satanta, a noted Kiowa chief of the mid-19th century, is really a spear with a <b>feathered</b> <b>end</b> and leather grip.

None of his messengers were yet returned, nor had any sent word that they were upon the trail of my followers. My heart sank a little, and such hope as I still fostered was fast perishing. Indeed, so imminent did my doom appear and so unavoidable, that {{later in the day}} I asked for pen and paper that I might make an attempt at setting my earthly affairs to rights. Yet when the writing materials were brought me, I wrote not. I sat instead with the <b>feathered</b> <b>end</b> of my quill between my teeth, and thus pondered the matter of the disposal of my Picardy estates.|$|R
50|$|The arrow-like {{projectiles}} of a crossbow {{are called}} bolts. These are much shorter than arrows, {{but can be}} several times heavier. There is an optimum weight for bolts to achieve maximum kinetic energy, which varies depending on the strength and characteristics of the crossbow, but most could pass through common mail. In ancient times, the bolts of a strong crossbow were usually several times heavier than arrows. Modern bolts are stamped with a proof mark to ensure their consistent weight {{and do not have}} fletching, i.e. <b>feathered</b> <b>ends</b> like those commonly seen on arrows. Crossbow bolts can be fitted with a variety of heads, some with sickle-shaped heads to cut rope or rigging; but the most common today is a four-sided point called a quarrel. A highly specialized type of bolt is employed to collect blubber biopsy samples used in biology research.|$|R

60|$|Old Marrow-Bone was {{the first}} to be smoked out. A light fan of air drifted the smoke away at the time so that I saw clearly. He broke out through the smoke, {{stepping}} on a burning coal and screaming with the sudden hurt of it, and essayed to climb up the cliff. The arrows showered about him. He came to a pause on a ledge, clutching a knob of rock for support, gasping and sneezing and shaking his head. He swayed back and forth. The <b>feathered</b> <b>ends</b> of a dozen arrows were sticking out of him. He was an old man, and {{he did not want to}} die. He swayed wider and wider, his knees giving under him, and as he swayed he wailed most plaintively. His hand released its grip and he lurched outward to the fall. His old bones must have been sadly broken. He groaned and strove feebly to rise, but a Fire-Man rushed in upon him and brained him with a club.|$|R

60|$|There was a flush on {{his face}} and a sparkle in the eyes that looked pensively before him what time he gnawed the <b>feathered</b> <b>end</b> of his quill. In his ears still rang the acclamations that had greeted his {{brilliant}} speech in the Assembly that day. He was of the party of the Mountain--as was but natural in a protege of the Seagreen Robespierre--a party more famed for its directness of purpose than elegance of expression, and in its ranks there was room and to spare for such orators as he. The season was March of '93--a season marked by the deadly feud raging 'twixt the Girondins and the Mountain, and in that battle of tongues La Boulaye was covering himself with glory and doing credit to his patron, the Incorruptible. He was of a rhetoric not inferior to Vergniaud's--that most eloquent Girondon--and of a quickness of wit and honesty of aim unrivalled in the whole body of the Convention, and with these gifts he harassed to no little purpose those smooth-tongued legislators of the Gironde, whom Dumouriez called the Jesuits of the Revolution. His popularity with the men of the Mountain and with the masses of Paris was growing daily, and the crushing reply he had that day delivered to the charges preferred by Vergniaud was likely to increase his fame.|$|R

2500|$|The chimney swift's genus name, Chaetura, is a {{combination}} of two Greek words: chaite, which means [...] "bristle" [...] or [...] "spine", and oura which means [...] "tail". This is an apt description of the bird's tail, as the shafts of all ten tail <b>feathers</b> (rectrices) <b>end</b> in sharp, protruding points. The specific name pelagica is derived from the Greek word pelagikos, which means [...] "of the sea". This is thought to be a reference to its nomadic lifestyle rather than to any reference to the sea, a theory strengthened by the later assignment of the specific name pelasgia (after the nomadic Pelasgi tribe of ancient Greece) to the same species by other ornithologists. Its common name refers to its preferred nesting site and its speedy flight.|$|R
6000|$|The single {{question}} of policy on which General McClellan differs from Mr. Lincoln, stripped of the conventional phrases in which he drapes it, is Slavery. He can mean nothing else when he talks of [...] "conciliation and compromise," [...] of receiving back any State that may choose to return [...] "with a full guaranty of all its constitutional rights." [...] If it be true that a rose by any other name will smell as sweet, it is equally true {{that there is a}} certain species of toadstool that would be none the less disgusting under whatever alias. Compromise and conciliation are both excellent things in their own way, and in the fitting time and place, but right cannot be compromised without surrendering it, and to attempt conciliation by showing the white <b>feather</b> <b>ends,</b> not in reconcilement, but subjection. The combined ignorance of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus as to what had been going on while they were in their cavern would hardly equal that of General McClellan alone as to the political history of the country. In the few months between Mr. Lincoln's election and the attack on Fort Sumter we tried conciliation in every form, carrying it almost to the verge of ignominy. The Southern leaders would have none of it. They saw in it only a confession of weakness, and were but the more arrogant in their demand of all or nothing. Compromise we tried for three quarters of a century, and it brought us to where we are, for it was only a fine name for cowardice, and invited aggression. And now that the patient is dying of this drench of lukewarm water, Doctor Sangrado McClellan gravely prescribes another gallon. If that fail to finish him, why, give him a gallon more.|$|R
