40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on <b>herd</b> <b>behaviour</b> in financial markets {{in the context of}} the sequential trading model and points out the importance of incorporating ambiguity into the framework. Although Ford et al.

This article adopts the smooth model suggested by Klibanoff et al. (2005), and applies Gollier's (2006) value function to describe decision makers' welfare under ambiguity. Using very general assumptions, we prove that if the value functions of market makers and traders are homogeneous, <b>herd</b> <b>behaviour</b> will never happen even if ambiguity exists; if some types of traders have different attitudes towards ambiguity from market makers, then <b>herd</b> <b>behaviour</b> will happen with a positive probability. Our numerical simulation suggests that <b>herd</b> <b>behaviour</b> is one of the reasons behind stock price bubbles, and the probability of <b>herd</b> <b>behaviour</b> is positively correlated with the ambiguity of the distribution of stock returns as well as the disparity between traders and market makers' attitudes towards this ambiguity. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> is {{the elusive}} phenomena. It means {{collective}} actions behaved by individuals under uncertain conditions (Adler and Adler 1984). Whereas the current financial market {{has an important}} character which is its uncertainty and fuzziness. Hence, investors sometimes have conformity in mind. This has already illuminated in the earlier economic theory. Keynes (1936) reckons that long-term investors probably {{are not willing to}} make decision based on their private information and own opinions because they want to avoid being considered as imprudence and not tallying with conventionality. As he mentioned in this paper, that the failure according with tradition can bring more benefits to reputation than success which is not according with tradition. In the stock market, when investors trade with similar stocks, <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> takes place. Besides, fund investors in the stock market, for instance, mutual funds, tends to have <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> easier than individual investors theoretically. The reason is fund investors are able to receive much high quality information than individual investors. They follow one another; eventually cause <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> (Lakonisok et al 1992). <b>Herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> will affect the stock price, driving stock prices away or closer to the intrinsic value. Both rational and irrational <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> will lead to wrong or warp estimation of asset value. In addition, <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> can be used to explain many phenomena such as stock price over-fluctuation, collapse of stock market and speculative bubbles etc. Therefore, researches on <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> will bring credit to the investors and market controllers both theoretically and empirically. Empirical analysis indicates that due to frequently government interfere and serious information asymmetry, <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> exists in the Chinese Stock market when market is fluctuating in the extreme market condition (i. e. bull market and bear market). Especially when the market is advancing, <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> tends to be much obvious.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> on financial markets and measure the <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> impact on the accuracy of analysts' earnings forecasts. Design/methodology/approach – Two alternative measures of <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour,</b> on analysts' earnings forecasts are proposed. The first measure identifies herding as the tendency of analysts to forecast near the consensus. The second measure identifies herding as the tendency of analysts to follow the most accurate forecaster. This paper employs the method of The Generalised Method of Moments in order to relax any possible biases. Findings – In both measures employed, a positive and significant relation is found between the accuracy of analysts' earnings forecasts and <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour.</b> According to the first measure analysts exhibit <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> by forecasting close to the consensus estimates. According the second herding measure, it is found that analysts tend to herd towards the best forecaster at the time. Finally, it is concluded that the accuracy of analysts' forecasts increases as herding increases. Research limitations/implications – The present study triggers concerns for further research in the modelling of analysts' forecasting behaviour. Originality/value – This paper proposes that a measure based on human biases is the best way to estimate and predict the analysts' earnings forecast future accuracy. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I study {{the effect of}} {{decision}} importance on propensity to engage in <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> and what is bounded rational, optimal, utility maximizing strategy for agents. In the beginning, prior literature on <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> and decision importance is reviewed. The only research connecting these two issues was done in psychology. Therefore a comparison and critique of psychological research versus experimental economics is provided in the methodological part. The main part of this thesis is designing an experiment aimed at differentiation of the propensity to engage in <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{with respect to the}} importance of the decisions being made. People decide in a cascade among two option according to signals obtained. Eight different treatments are run, each with different size of monetary reward as a motivation. Everyone gets two signals, one private and one public. In situations when these signals are contradictory and of the same informativeness, decisions are measured and compared among treatments. Main hypothesis is that people {{are less likely to be}} influenced by other people's decisions as the task importance rises. Also data analysis is outlined.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate market participants’ gregarious behaviour in Baltic stock markets, namely Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia during the period January 2003 -December 2013. The <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> derives from the investors’ irrationality, who trade financial assets based on their positive expectations about prices future growth, generating manias among other market participants, thus ignoring the real return rates and the risk levels of their investments. The investors’ irrational behaviour is influenced by actions, feelings and impulses that are intertwined: mimicry, fear, trust, greed, optimism, pessimism, euphoria, panic. These features highlight an erroneous perception of investors in point of unsustained increase in prices, which has been generated by the stock prices deviations from their fundamental value. Under these premises, optimism, overreaction and speculative bubbles are appearing on the market and may constitute triggering factors of a financial crash. The probability of the occurrence of the speculative bubbles and financial crashes is influenced by the continuous entry on the market of new investors and less informed participants, which often act based on impulse, following a benchmark, without considering their own analysis and information that they hold. The existence of a “collective behaviour” of the investors, which is manifested by their tendency to imitate other market participants actions and to “follow the herd”, so ignoring their own beliefs, may increase market sensitivity to shocks and the probability of the occurrence of the systemic risk. In order to identify the investors’ <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour,</b> I have applied an adjusted CSSD model proposed by (Yao, Ma, Peng He, 2014), which implies the inclusion of two additional variables, the first one, to reduce the effect of multicollinearity and a second one, a lag term of the dependent variable, in order to improve the power of the model.

40|$|This {{study shows}} that due to <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour</b> and {{possible}} capital outflows, emerging market countries are vulnerable to multiple equilibria situations and currency crises. It uses a model by Jeanne (1997), where currency crises can be formed by multiple equilibria and self-fulfilling expectations. We determine the country fundamentals according to balance of payments approach. In this study we introduce capital flows, which depend from crisis probability, into the model. The capital flows are further assumed to follow <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour,</b> which produces a reason and mechanism for the large capital outflows witnessed during the recent crises. The range of country fundamentals, where self-fulfilling crises are possible, is now larger than without capital flows and <b>herding</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Consequently, the country fundamentals have to be better, if the country wants to stay totally out of crises. The model further points out lender interdependence as one shortcoming in the current structure of international capital markets. An empirical application of the model to the Mexican and Asian crises shows that when the possible capital outflows are included, the fundamentals of most emerging market countries were inside the range of multiple equilibria in 1994 and 1996, and so self-fulfilling crises were possible. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Herd</b> <b>Behaviour</b> {{is often}} cited {{as one of the}} forces behind excess {{volatility}} of stock prices as well as speculative bubbles and crashes in financial markets. This paper examines if social interaction and <b>herd</b> <b>behaviour,</b> modelled within a multi-agent framework, can explain these characteristics. The core of the model is based on the social learning literature which takes place in a small world network. We find that when the network consists entirely of herd agents then expectations become locked in an information cascade. Herd agents receive a signal, compare it with those agents with whom they are connected, and then adopt the majority position. Adding one expert agent enables the population to break the cascade as information filters from that agent to all other agents through contagion. We also find that moving from an ordered to a small world network dramatically increases the level of volatility in agent expectations and it quickly reaches a higher level (at which point increasing the randomness of the network has little effect). Increasing the influence of the experts, by increasing the number of connections from these agents, also increases volatility in the aggregate level of expectations. Finally it is found that under certain network structures <b>herd</b> <b>behaviour</b> will lead to information cascades and potentially to the formation of speculative bubbles...|$|R
