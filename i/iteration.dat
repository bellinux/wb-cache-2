5|$|The RTHK Chinese Gold Song Awards {{are given}} {{annually}} by Radio and Television Hong Kong. Ceremonies are held {{once a year}} between late December to early January, and honour works produced in the previous year. An exception to this rule occurred in 2003, when the 25th and 26th editions of the awards show were both held in the same year. The 25th <b>iteration,</b> held in January 2003, served as the 2002 edition; the 26th <b>iteration,</b> held in December 2003, served as the 2003 edition.

30|$|Results in columns {{eight and}} nine show the the {{performance}} of the players after learning (training). The columns show that after learning, out of the same thirteen <b>iterations</b> that were used before learning, the fuzzy player wins a total of ten <b>iterations</b> (additional wins of two <b>iterations</b> and these therefore means losses to the opponent) while the opponent wins only three <b>iterations.</b> After learning, the two additional <b>iterations</b> won by the fuzzy player, as shown in the table, are <b>iterations</b> 4 and 8. Therefore, these means that the opponent has lost two additional <b>iterations</b> as a result of zero sum concept.|$|R
