60|$|His message {{began to}} be {{received}} by Mr. Wendigee when that gentleman was engaged in quite a different investigation. The reader will no doubt recall the little excitement that began the century, arising out of an announcement by Mr. Nikola Tesla, the American electrical celebrity, that he had received a message from Mars. His announcement renewed attention to fact that had long been familiar to scientific people, namely: that from some unknown source in space, waves of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>disturbance,</b> entirely similar those used by Signor Marconi for his wireless telegraphy, are constantly reaching the earth. Besides Tesla {{quite a number of}} other observers have been engaged in perfecting apparatus for receiving and recording these vibrations, though few would go so far to consider them actual messages from some extraterrestrial sender. Among that few, however, we must certainly count Mr. Wendigee. Ever since 1898 he had devoted himself almost entirely to this subject, and being a man of ample means he had erected an observatory on the flanks of Monte Rosa, in a position singularly adapted in every way for such observations.|$|E

50|$|When the {{recording}} of ECG signal is finished (usually after 24 or 48 hours), {{it is up to}} the physician to perform the signal analysis. Since it would be extremely time demanding to browse through such a long signal, there is an integrated automatic analysis process in the software of each Holter device which automatically determines different sorts of heart beats, rhythms, etc. However the success of the automatic analysis is very closely associated with the signal quality. The quality itself mainly depends on the attachment of the electrodes to the patient body. If these are not properly attached, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>disturbance</b> can influence the ECG signal resulting in a very noisy record. If the patient moves rapidly, the distortion will be even bigger. Such record is then very difficult to process. Besides the attachment and quality of electrodes, there are other factors affecting the signal quality, such as muscle tremors, sampling rate and resolution of the digitized signal (high quality devices offer higher sampling frequency).|$|E
