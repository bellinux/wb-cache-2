One crucial technology area enabling all space exploration is electric power systems. In this paper, the author evaluates surface power technology options {{in order to identify}} leading candidate technologies that will accomplish lunar design reference mission three (LDRM- 3). LDRM- 3 mission consists of multiple, 90 -day missions to the lunar South Pole with 4 -person crews starting in the year 2020. Top-level power requirements included a nominal 50 kW continuous habitat power over a 5 -year lifetime with back-up or redundant emergency power provisions and a nominal 2 -kW, 2 -person unpressurized rover. To help direct NASA's technology investment strategy, this lunar surface power technology evaluation assessed many figures of merit including: current technology readiness levels (TRLs), potential to advance to TRL 6 by 2014, effectiveness of the technology to meet the mission requirements in the specified time, mass, stowed volume, deployed area, complexity, required special ground facilities, safety, reliability/redundancy, strength of <b>industrial</b> base, <b>applicability</b> to other LDRM- 3 elements, extensibility to Mars missions, costs, and risks.

Preferred energy storage technologies included lithium-ion battery and Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Regenerative Fuel Cells (RFC). Several AC and DC power management and distribution architectures and component technologies were defined consistent with the preferred habitat power generation technology option and the overall lunar surface mission.

40|$|According {{to recent}} researches, it is {{desirable}} to extend <b>Industrial</b> Robots (IR) <b>applicability</b> to strategic fields such as heavy and/or fine deburring of customized parts with complex geometry. In fact, from a conceptual point of view, anthropomorphic manipulators could effectively provide an excellent alternative to dedicated machine tools (lathes, milling machines, etc.), by being both flexible (due to their lay-out) and cost efficient (20 - 50 % cost reduction as compared to traditional CNC machining).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on a {{research}} project to monitor the temperature profile along a power cable using the fibre optic Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) technology. Based on the temperature measured by a DTS system, real time condition monitoring of power cables can be achieved. In this thesis, there are three main research themes. 1. Develop a DTS system for industrial applications. The entire hardware system and measuring software are developed to be an industrial product. Multiple functions are provided for the convenience of users to conduct temperature monitoring, temperature history logging and off-line simulation. 2. Enhance the robustness of the DTS system. An algorithm for signal compensation is developed to eliminate the signal fluctuation due to disturbance from the hardware and its working environment. It ensures robustness of the system in <b>industrial</b> environments and <b>applicability</b> to different system configurations. 3. Improve the accuracy of the DTS system. A calibration algorithm based on cubic spline fitting is developed to cope with non-uniform fibre loss in the system, which greatly improved the accuracy of the temperature decoding in real applications with unavoidable nonlinear characteristics.

Firstly, this research identified the most relevant socio-technical aspects of` requirements-driven collaboration among agile teams through an online survey conducted on industry practitioners, as communication and awareness. Secondly, a framework was proposed to study the identified socio-technical aspects of requirements-driven collaboration among agile teams and a prototype was developed to partially automate the framework. Thirdly, an empirical investigation was conducted by studying four IT-based projects carried out in four different organizations. This empirical investigation led to the practical implementation of the proposed framework to study the requirements-driven collaboration among agile teams.

40|$|Advances in the {{development}} and integration of small battery-powered sensing devices have enabled the design of applications where a group of sensors cooperate in monitoring their environment. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are today used {{in a wide variety of}} areas like e. g. habitat monitoring, battle field surveillance, disaster management, health monitoring or <b>industrial</b> control. Their <b>applicability</b> is often reduced by limitations in the sensor nodes power supply, communication bandwidth, processing capabilities and buffer size. Many researchers have put effort in overcoming these shortcomings, with a special focus on maximizing the battery lifetime of a single node as well as the lifetime of the network as a whole. A list of possible applications can be found in [Akyildiz]. As applications become more and more mission-critical, it is crucial that the collected sensor data arrive at the sink within a specified time limit. Guaranteeing a certain quality of service (QoS) to a user or an application is difficult because of the unpredictable nature of the wireless link and the often unstable topology of the sensor network (due to node failure or mobility). Very little research has been done in the field of QoS for WSNs [Chen] [Wang] and many interesting research questions are still unanswered. This state-of-the-art document aims at giving an overview on routing and medium access issues in WSNs and at summarizing some of the most interesting solutions. The requirements on WSN protocols are very dependent on the application in which the WSN will be used. Aspects as energy-efficiency, latency, Quality of Service (QoS), mobility, distribution density or cost all influence the choice of protocol and its parameters. There is therefore no single protocol that matches all types of WSN and the best results can only be achieved by tailoring the protocol for a specific application or scenario.

40|$|Embedded systems, as {{for example}} {{communication}} and control systems, are being increasingly {{used in our}} daily lives and hence require thorough and systematic testing before their actual use. Many of these systems interact with their environment and, therefore, their functionality is largely dependent on this environment whose behavior can be unpredictable. Robustness testing aims at testing {{the behavior of a}} system in the presence of faulty situations in its operating environment (e. g., sensors and actuators). In such situations, the system should gracefully degrade its performance instead of abruptly stopping execution. To systematically perform robustness testing, one option is to resort to Model-Based Robustness Testing (MBRT), which is a systematic, rigorous, and automated way of conducting robustness testing. However, to successfully apply MBRT in industrial contexts, new technologies need to be developed to scale to the complexity of real industrial systems. This thesis presents a solution for MBRT on industrial systems, including scalable robustness modeling and executable test case generation. One important contribution of this thesis is a scalable RobUstness Modeling Methodology (RUMM), which is achieved using Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM). It is a complete, automated, and practical methodology that covers all features of state machines and aspect concepts necessary for MBRT. Such methodology, relying on a standard (Unified Modeling Language or UML) and using the target notation as the basis to model the aspects themselves, is expected to make the practical adoption of robustness modeling easier in <b>industrial</b> contexts. The <b>applicability</b> of the methodology is demonstrated using an industrial case study. Results showed that the approach significantly reduced modeling effort (98 % on average), improved separation of concerns, and eased model evolution. The approach is further empirically evaluated using two controlled experiments involving human subjects and results showed that the proposed methodology significantly improves the readability of models as compared to modeling using standard UML notations. Another important contribution of this thesis is an efficient approach for solving constraints (written in Objects Constraint Language (OCL)) on the operating environment of a system, which is mandatory for emulating faulty situation in the environment for the purpose of MBRT. A set of novel heuristics is devised for various OCL constructs, which are required for the application of search algorithms. The heuristics have been empirically evaluated on an industrial case study for robustness testing and the results showed to be very promising and significantly better than the existing works in the literature on OCL constraint solvers. A final contribution of the thesis is robustness test case generation from the models developed using RUMM. Test case generation also includes scripts generation for environment emulation, which is mandatory for automated robustness testing again using an industrial case study. In preliminary experiments, the execution of test cases found one critical, robustness fault in a deployed industrial system...|$|R

Die Interaktion erfolgt bei solchen fensterorientierten Bediensystemen mittels koordinatengebender Interaktionsgeräte. Im Bürobereich wird dabei als Interaktionsgerät überwiegend eine Computermaus eingesetzt.

Unter anderem wird zwar zur Lösung dieser Probleme eine Vielzahl von alternativen Interaktionsgeräten (wie z. B. Trackballs, Touchscreens, Joysticks, Mousepads, Mousebuttons, etc.) eingesetzt, allerdings ist deren Gebrauchstauglichkeit für die Benutzer nicht geklärt bzw. fragwürdig.

The {{commonly}} used windows-orientated user interfaces in offices {{are more and}} more often applied in the field of industry. The interaction in these windows-orientated operating systems, as they have been developed for the operation system Windows of the market leader Microsoft, occurs by means of coordinate determining interaction devices. In the field of offices a computer mouse is mostly used as interaction device. However an industrial application in a rough environment is not feasible unless it is protected against pollution. Further problems e. g. the non-available surface when a board is used and the machine vibrations in case of a non-coupled operating system are resulting from the industrial environment. Numerous alternative interaction devices are used to solve these problems, however their usability for the user could not be clarified and is rather questionable. Hence the aim {{is to be able to}} evaluate the usability of interaction devices. The evaluation of interaction devices must take into account the whole human being as user with its capabilities and capacities in order to avoid an excessive and onesided demand during the work process. A comparative investigation was carried out for alternative pointing devices to determine the usability of pointing devices for humans and their <b>industrial</b> suitability. The <b>applicability</b> and validity of the test methods are evaluated by determining the influence of various identification features such as experience of the user, operating position of the user, position of the interaction device and device design.

40|$|The use of time-of-day (TOD) pricing as a load {{management}} tool for electric utilities has recently gained wide interest. Although utilities have successfully used TOD pricing for some <b>industrial</b> customers, its <b>applicability</b> {{in the residential}} sector is untested. The Federal Energy Administration (and now the Department of Energy) has funded several experiments to test the implications of TOD pricing for residential customers. The major objective {{of this study is}} to analyze the Arizona TOD pricing experiment. Data from the first six months of the experiment had been analyzed previously in several different studies. Summaries of their methodologies and results are presented in Chapter 1. Many of these earlier analyses were unable to identify significant TOD price responses. A major deficiency in all was their failure to account properly for participation incentive payments. Consequently, meaningful inferences regarding residential responses to TOD prices cannot be drawn from these misspecified models. Chapter 2 contains a description of the experiment and the data is generated. The basic observation is monthly kilowatt hours consumed by each household in three time periods. Special attention is given to the derivation of the incentive payment inherent in the experimental design. This payment depends on experimental rates and patterns of pre-experimental usage. Specific adjustments to the data are required due to variations in billing cycle lengths and days. Details of these procedures and information on how the samples were edited are discussed in Chapter 3. The conclusion of this chapter presents data which reveal that households did significantly shift consumption from high to low cost periods. Chapter 4 contains a description of the hypothesized models and statistical methodology. Since this study focuses on household responses to TOD prices while controlling for impacts of experimental design, theoretically derived models are not tested. Income, TOD prices, heating or cooling degree-days, the electricity-using capacity of the households' appliance stocks, and incentive payments are the major determinants of consumption investigated. Ordinary least squares techniques are used to estimate TOD demand models for each month, for the summers of 1976 and 1977, and for the winter of 1976 / 77. Since the experimental design was modified in May, 1977, an analysis of covariance was done to test for structural changes. The results presented in Chapter 5 emphasize the importance of including the incentive payment in the TOD models. Without this term, no TOD price is significant. With it, TOD prices and the other independent variables are shown to be significant determinants of consumption. Statistical results are very impressive for the models estimated from the 18 months of cross-sectional data. Since the incentive payments depended partially on the rates to which customers were assigned, calculation of price elasticities had to be modified accordingly. Simple elasticities measured price responses which ignored the impact of the incentive payment. Since the incentive did not depend on experimental usage, it is the appropriate measure of household responses to TOD prices. Total price elasticities are used to measure TOD price responses under the specific Arizona experimental environment. A number of important conclusions are discussed in Chapter 6. The most important deal with the treatment of the incentive payment. When it is properly modeled, meaningful price coefficients can be estimated. Also, the results strongly suggest that households earmarked this payment for electricity purchases. Partial derivatives of the incentive were much larger than those for income. Misleading billing information may have produced this unexpected result. In May, 1978, billing procedures were improved. An analysis of these data should shed more light on this important matter...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{bioreactor}} (MBR) {{technology for}} treatment of organically contaminated wastewater {{is one of the}} notable developments in recent years. MBR technology is based on the ongoing development of biological water treatment with suspended biomass, where membranes are used to separate the biologically treated water from the biomass. Major benefits of MBR compared to existing technologies are the improved effluent quality and lower footprint. Both characteristics are of special interest in industrial applications, because in addition to environmental issues, the possibility exists for the direct/ indirect reuse of the treated water within the <b>industrial</b> process. However, <b>applicability</b> of MBRs relies on their technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness. Both criteria are primarily dependent on the filtration performance of the membrane unit, which determines membrane surface area required and operating costs, {{as well as on the}} cleaning efficiency or the treated effluent quality. In the municipal sector, there is substantial experience with MBR filtration and cleaning performance, due to the number of operating installations and similarity of the wastewater to be treated. In general, municipal MBR performance varies little between applications. In contrast, significant variations exist between industrial wastewater sectors, due to the highly application-dependent characteristics of industrial wastewaters. To date, most of the plants reflect specific applications and there is little detailed or transferable knowledge available to account for these differences in performance. In addition, much of the existing knowledge remains primarily with the technology providers and operators of MBR systems. In order to develop a basis for the optimal introduction of MBR technology within the industrial sector, a more accurate and comprehensive investigation of the differences in performance is required. Consequently, the primary goals of this work were to identify the key factors of MBR performance, to develop suitable methods for the characterization, quantification and – where feasible – prediction of MBR performance. Based on the gathered knowledge, advanced approaches for the improvement of MBR performance have been developed. Investigations of MBR performance were carried out by treating different water sources in MBR systems. Wastewaters were derived from the chemical, pharmaceutical, textile and paper industry as well as heavily loaded process wastewaters from solids disposal and biotreatment and sludge handling. The wastewaters used represent a wide range with respect to the types and concentrations of contaminants to be eliminated and their biodegradability. Consequently, a wide variety of filtration and cleaning performance was achieved during MBR treatment. For some of the treated wastewaters, a lack of performance indicated that MBR technology was not technically or economically viable. The biodegradability of soluble or low molecular weight organic compounds is a key factor in achieving the desired cleaning performance. A detailed assessment can be undertaken in analytical laboratory testing. In comparison, the molecular weight cut off of the applied micro- or ultrafiltration membranes is of minor importance. Desired filtration performance and especially variances from municipal applications are primarily determined by the fouling factors "colloidal fouling" and "scaling". Suitable methods have been developed to evaluate or forecast the fouling and scaling potential of mixed liquors and raw wastewaters. Further investigations indicated a high potential for optimizing performance. As an alternative to advanced treatment downstream the MBR, improvements in cleaning performance can be achieved by simultaneous addition of powdered activated carbon. Improvements of filtration performance through reduction of fouling and scaling potential were also successfully tested by upstream or simultaneous removal of related compounds. All approaches for optimization were critically evaluated to identify if and under which conditions a sustainable and economical increase in performance could be achieved. It is anticipated that the knowledge gathered in this work will help to solve operational problems of existing MBRs, improve MBR cost-effectiveness and further expand the applicability of MBRs to previously problematic industrial wastewater applications...|$|R
