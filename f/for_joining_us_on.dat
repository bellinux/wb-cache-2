And up next, a movie long thought to be lost before it was rediscovered and presented at last year's TCM Classic Film Festival. From Citation Films in nineteen sixty — Private Property. Oates and Corey Allen play a couple of sketchy drifters named Duke and Boots. They're hitchhiking their way across Southern California — for a threatening version of George and Lenny in Of Mice and Men. They spy an attractive woman driving a Corvette. Duke and Boots follow her home, take up residence in the vacant house next door, with the intention of spying on her and then seducing her.|$|E

The older men would do as good service here, were the castle besieged in our absence; of which, however, there is but slight chance; but for work against the Welsh, they would be of little use." ...|$|R
