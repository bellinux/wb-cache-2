Yet more than a precept, the observance should be seen as a need rising from the depths of Christian life.

Though she participated <b>fully</b> <b>in</b> the life of James' court and maintained a court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, she rarely took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private difficulties with James, she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England, conducting herself with discretion and graciousness in public.

5|$|Macdonald {{consistently}} {{called for}} a more equitable redistribution of wealth, so that poorer provinces such as Nova Scotia, could share <b>fully</b> <b>in</b> Canada's prosperity. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald deserves credit for the introduction, in 1957, of an equalization scheme designed to enable poorer provinces to provide comparable levels of services to their citizens. Macdonald's advocacy of provincial autonomy however, fell victim to the centralizing tendencies of a post-war welfare state in which the federal government increasingly assumed greater control over national social programs.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald's {{more than}} 15 years as premier brought {{fundamental}} changes. Under his leadership, the Nova Scotia government {{spent more than}} $100million paving roads, building bridges, extending electrical transmission lines and improving public education. Macdonald dealt with the mass unemployment of the Great Depression by putting the jobless to work on highway projects. He felt direct government relief payments would weaken moral character, undermine self-respect and discourage personal initiative. However, he also faced the reality that the financially strapped Nova Scotia government {{could not afford to}} participate <b>fully</b> <b>in</b> federal relief programs that required matching contributions from the provinces.|$|E
5|$|Over the bridges, the new key is set <b>fully</b> <b>in</b> {{the minor}} mode, {{avoiding}} the Dorian inflections present in previous Harrison songs. These sections begin on an E minor chord, which, in Roman numeral analysis, represents a v minor in the tonic of A and an iv minor {{in the new}} key. At {{the end of each}} bridge, the return to the home key is effected via an E major chord, marking the only use of the expected G note in the A major scale.|$|E

5|$|A Warrior Who Fought Custer was {{published}} in April 1931 to mostly good reviews. However, W. J. Ghent, writing in the New York Times, criticized the claim made by Wooden Leg that many of Custer's men had committed suicide rather than face death {{at the hands of}} the Indians. Although sales of the Wooden Leg book did well, better than Marquis had expected, this controversy was to prove a hindrance to his chances of future book publications. Marquis believed he had multiple Indian sources verifying this account, and there were no surviving whites to contradict it. He planned to develop the idea more <b>fully</b> <b>in</b> a future book, eventually to become Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself.|$|E

It is planned to replace all the current buildings, which date back to 1951.

Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
5|$|Now <b>fully</b> <b>in</b> {{the town}} of Lockport, NY31 and NY93 proceed {{northeast}} through an open area of the town as a four-lane divided highway. The two routes continue to {{the western edge of}} the city of Lockport, where they intersect with Upper Mountain Road and the Lockport Bypass. The overlap ends here as NY93 turns southeastward onto the two-lane bypass. Along the bypass, NY93 briefly enters the city limits as it runs past several industrial facilities and intersects with Hinman Road (CR903) just ahead of a bridge over the Erie Canal. Past the waterway, the bypass takes a more southerly course through an undeveloped part of {{the town of}} Lockport to a junction with Robinson Road (CR123) on the Lockport–Pendleton town line. The Lockport Bypass ends here, leaving NY93 to turn eastward onto Robinson Road.|$|E
