40|$|Although exercise-induced {{hematuria}} is a {{well known}} finding in long distance running, it is extremely rare in cycling. We describe a case of gross atraumatic hematuria after mountainbiking. The only pathologic finding in our patient was a small hyperemic zone in the bladder mucosa suggesting a local traumatic origin due to repeated contact of the <b>flaccid</b> <b>bladder</b> wall against the bladder base. This {{in contrast with the}} renal origin commonly seen in marathon runners. It is a benign hematuria that usually resolves within a day without specific treatment. The best treatment is prevention by means of good bladder filling. Neoplasm of the urothelium should be ruled out in differential diagnosis. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case of urinary {{retention}} and constipation secondary to Herpes zoster {{in the distribution of}} the second and third sacral dermatomes in a 68 -year-old woman. Vesical irritability was not observed. Cystometry revealed a <b>flaccid</b> type <b>bladder.</b> Cell count of spinal fluid increased but clinical symptoms and physical findings of myelitis were not observed. A Foley catheter was left indwelling for five days due to urinary retention. After removal of the catheter, bladder paresis gradually improved. Skin eruption and disturbance of urination completely improved about three weeks later. Forty-seven cases of bladder involvement secondary to Herpes zoster including our case {{have been reported in the}} Japanese literature...|$|R
40|$|Although SCIWORA {{has been}} {{reported}} more prevalent in children, few case reports published SCIWORA in adults. Twenty seven year old man transferred to our rehabilitation unit with paraplegia arose after fall from height of 8 and concurrent blunt trauma to thoracic region. The neurological level was of T 11 American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of both brain, and spine didn%u 2019 t prove any significant abnormalities except the protrusion of intervertebral discs at the levels of T 8 - 9, and T 9 - 10. Urodynamic study findings were compatible with <b>flaccid</b> neurogenic <b>bladder.</b> He enrolled in the neurological rehabilitation program. After neurological rehabilitation program partial improvement observed in his functional status. The diagnosis of SCIWORA without any abnormality in the spine with MRI may be challenging. Therefore the diagnosis might retard until the termination of spinal shock...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{provides}} an overview of the spinal cord injury focusing mainly on aspects related to rehabilitation. Spinal cord injury affects young people in an active phase of life, determining severe handicaps. Most of the lesions are traumatic, caused by car accidents. Until fifty years ago, the survival of individuals with spinal cord injury was very reduced and {{the leading cause of death}} was renal failure. Due to developments in medical knowledge and technical advances, the survival rates have significantly improved. The causes of death have also changed being respiratory complications, particularly pneumonia, the leading causes. Immediately after a spinal cord lesion there is a phase of spinal shock which is characterized by <b>flaccid</b> paralysis and <b>bladder</b> and bowel retention. Progressively there is a return of the spinal cord automatism with the beginning of some reflex activities. Based on neurological evaluation it is pos-sible to predict motor and functional recovery and establish the rehabilitation program. We can consider three phases on the rehabilitation program: the first while the patient is still in bed, directed to prevent or treat complications due to immobility and begin sphincters reeducation; the second phase is intended to achieve wheelchair autonomy; the last phase is training in ortostatism. The rehabilitation program also comprises sports and recreational activities, psychological and social support in order to achieve an integral of the individual with a spinal cord injury...|$|R
