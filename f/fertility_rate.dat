50|$|Total <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> {{are higher}} {{among women in}} rural areas than among women in urban areas, as {{evidenced}} from low-income, middle-income and high-income countries. Field {{researchers have found that}} <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> are high and remain relatively stable among rural populations. Little evidence exists to suggest that high-fertility parents appear to be economically disadvantaged, further strengthening the fact that total <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> tend to be higher among women in rural areas. On the other hand, studies have suggested that a higher population density is associated with decreased <b>fertility</b> <b>rates.</b> It is shown through studies that <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> differ between regions in ways that reflect the opportunity costs of child rearing. In a region with high population density, women restrain themselves from having many children due to the costs of living, therefore lowering the <b>fertility</b> <b>rates.</b> Within urban areas, people in suburbs are consistently found to have higher fertility. Thus, it is proven that the residence of women {{plays a major role in}} <b>fertility</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R

This paper is an attempt {{to examine the effects of}} a change in <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> on population structure, labor supply, and employment in relation to physical capital stock for the next four decades. This study also evaluates the effects of a possible reversal change in <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> on the variables mentioned above. The study is carried out in three stages. In the first stage, population of Turkey is projected with Leslie matrix defined by age-specific <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> and survival rates.

In the third stage, the predictions obtained through the first two stages are combined. Thus, the question of what should be the warranted growth rates of physical capital stock in order to employ labor force projected under different <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> is answered. According to the results, increases in <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> lead to an increase in labor supply with a 15 year lag, even if <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> have remained unchanged in their current level.

The second is that, somehow surprisingly, female secondary education rates are much less available worldwide than <b>fertility</b> <b>rates,</b> FPRs or GDP per capita. The inclusion of female secondary education would make our countries’ longitudinal equations too short to run.

This issue of California Counts focuses on two: race/ethnicity and nativity, or mother’s place of birth.
