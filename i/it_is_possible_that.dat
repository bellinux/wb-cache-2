In their walk they had come exactly to the spot in which Eleanor had been provoked into slapping Mr. Slope's face.

5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> {{other planets}} with shorter orbital periods than HAT-P-33b {{exist in the}} system. However, {{at the time of}} HAT-P-33b's discovery, not enough radial {{velocity}} measurements had been collected to determine if this is so.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> {{settlements}} {{have existed}} {{in the area around}} Rivington since the Bronze Age. Arrowheads, a flint knife, scrapers and the remains of cremations were excavated from a Bronze Age cairn at Noon Hill in 1958 and 1963–64. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the name Coblowe on the eastern bank of the Lower Rivington Reservoir derives from the Old English hlaw, a hill, which denoted an ancient barrow or burial place. Evidence for the existence of a settlement here in Anglo-Saxon times is found in the Rivington and Coblowe names.|$|E

5|$|Large-scale gene {{transfer}} has also occurred between {{the ancestors of}} eukaryotic cells and bacteria, during the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> eukaryotes themselves originated from horizontal {{gene transfer}}s between bacteria and archaea.|$|E

5|$|The {{radiocarbon}} dating {{of the human}} remains {{does not provide a}} date for the construction of Coldrum Long Barrow itself; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the individuals died either some time before or after the monument's construction.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{suggestion}} {{holds the}} 21,636-year precession cycles solely responsible.

5|$|Almost all the {{surviving}} source material is of questionable reliability. The two witnesses who gave evidence, Robert Stubbs and James Kelsall, were strongly motivated to exonerate themselves from blame. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the figures concerning {{the number of}} slaves killed, {{the amount of water}} that remained on the ship, and the distance beyond Jamaica that Zong had mistakenly sailed are inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{creation}} of literature was predominantly a male scribal pursuit, some works {{are thought to have}} been written by women. For example, several references to women writing letters and surviving private letters sent and received by women have been found. However, Edward F. Wente asserts that, even with explicit references to women reading letters, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> women employed others to write documents.|$|E
60|$|He {{was almost}} as badly stunned by the {{significance}} of Swenson's news as Swenson himself.
