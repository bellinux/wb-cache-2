Mentioned by Marco Polo in the 13th century, this remote and isolated archipelago {{consists of four}} islands and two rocky islets delineating the southern limit of the Gulf of Aden. The site has a rich biodiversity. Nowhere else <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>do</b> 37% of Socotra's 825 plants, 90% of its reptiles and 95% of its snails occur. It is home to 192 bird species, 253 species of coral, 730 species of coastal fish, and 300 species of crab and lobster, {{as well as a}} range of Aloes and the Dragon's Blood Tree (Dracaena cinnabari). The cultural heritage of Socotra includes the unique Soqotri language.|$|E
25|$|As the {{combustion}} flue gas exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This {{is called the}} air preheater. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains nitrogen along with combustion products carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters or electrostatic precipitators. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes {{be used in the}} manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>do</b> not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution. Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has been doing the same for over 25 years. China is now beginning to grapple with the pollution caused by coal-fired power stations.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, when Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta {{outlined}} {{a plan to}} withdraw U.S. combat troops by 2013 if possible, Romney criticized the announcement, saying, [...] "Why <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>do</b> {{you go to the}} people that you’re fighting with and tell them the date you’re pulling out your troops?" [...] Romney's 2012 presidential election campaign website similarly criticized the Obama Administration for announcing a timetable for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, and reiterated his position that in a Romney presidency, decisions about when to withdraw troops would be made based on the advice of commanders in the field, not electoral politics.|$|E
2500|$|Solar {{cells have}} a great {{potential}} to help rural electrification. [...] An estimated two million villages near the equator have limited access to electricity and fossil fuels and that approximately 25% of people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>do</b> {{not have access to}} electricity. [...] When the cost of extending power grids, running rural electricity and using diesel generators is compared with the cost of solar cells, many times the solar cells win. [...] If the efficiency and cost of the current solar cell technology is decreased even further, then many rural communities and villages around the world could obtain electricity when current methods are out of the question. [...] Specific applications for rural communities would be water pumping systems, residential electric supply and street lights. [...] A particularly interesting application would be for health systems in countries where motorized vehicles are not overly abundant. [...] Solar cells could be used to provide the power to refrigerate medications in coolers during transport.|$|E
