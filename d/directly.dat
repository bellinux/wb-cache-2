5|$|Amelle Berrabah {{stated that}} the group was <b>directly</b> {{involved}} {{in the development of}} the perfumes. Jade Ewen commented that the group was <b>directly</b> involved in the creation of the perfumes, such the choices for their scents and ingredients and the packaging, over a six-month period. The group members expressed interest in creating further products following their perfumes, such as make-up and clothing lines.|$|E

5|$|During the Kamakura and Muromachi period, samurai wore a short sword {{known as}} koshigatana in {{addition}} to the long tachi. Koshigatana were stuck <b>directly</b> into the belt {{in the same way as}} later the katana and uchigatana. They had a mounting without a guard (tsuba). The corresponding style is known as aikuchi ("fitting mouth") as the mouth of the scabbard meets the hilt <b>directly</b> without intervening guard.|$|E

5|$|Gamma ray {{astronomy}} observes astronomical objects at {{the shortest}} wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed <b>directly</b> by satellites such as the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays <b>directly</b> but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} {{to be involved in the}} majority of cases, either <b>directly</b> or indirectly. Some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect (1–2%); most are due to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, either <b>directly</b> or indirectly. These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E

5|$|I-17 {{enters the}} valley {{from the north}} as the Black Canyon Freeway, in the New River and Anthem area before a four-level {{interchange}} with Loop 101. It then continues <b>directly</b> southward on the 27th and 25th Avenue alignments in northern Phoenix, passing Metrocenter Mall as it heads <b>directly</b> for downtown. Another four-level stack awaits I-17 when it meets Interstate 10 immediately northwest of downtown at The Stack.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Margaret MacVicar {{founded the}} Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) to enable {{undergraduates}} to collaborate <b>directly</b> with {{faculty members and}} researchers. Students join or initiate research projects ("UROPs") for academic credit, pay, or on a volunteer basis through postings on the UROP website or by contacting faculty members <b>directly.</b> A substantial majority of undergraduates participate. Students often become published, file patent applications, and/or launch start-up companies based upon their experience in UROPs.|$|E

5|$|In July 2015, {{after nearly}} {{ten years of}} Eris being {{considered}} the ninth-largest object known to <b>directly</b> orbit the sun, close-up imagery from the New Horizons mission more accurately determined Pluto's volume to be slightly larger than Eris's, rather than slightly smaller as previously thought. Eris is now the tenth-largest object known to <b>directly</b> orbit the sun by volume, though not by mass.|$|E
5|$|In {{the member}} states of the European Union, if the {{parliament}} has only one chamber, it is wholly <b>directly</b> elected in all cases. If there are two chambers, the lower house is <b>directly</b> elected in all cases, while the upper house can be <b>directly</b> elected (e.g. the Senate of Poland); or indirectly elected, for example, by regional legislatures (e.g. the Federal Council of Austria); or non-elected, but representing certain interest groups (e.g. the National Council of Slovenia); or non-elected (though by and large appointed by elected officials) as a remnant of a non-democratic political system in earlier times (as in the House of Lords in the United Kingdom).|$|E

5|$|Mossy fibers project <b>directly</b> to {{the deep}} nuclei, but also give rise to the {{following}} pathway: mossy fibers → granule cells → parallel fibers → Purkinje cells → deep nuclei. Climbing fibers project to Purkinje cells and also send collaterals <b>directly</b> {{to the deep}} nuclei. The mossy fiber and climbing fiber inputs each carry fiber-specific information; the cerebellum also receives dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic inputs that presumably perform global modulation.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities {{are run by}} mayors, who {{are elected}} to {{four-year}} terms, and by <b>directly</b> elected municipal councils. Bulgaria is a highly centralised state, where the national Council of Ministers <b>directly</b> appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding.|$|E

5|$|On 3 May 2012, Bristol held a {{referendum}} on the question of a <b>directly</b> elected mayor replacing one elected by the council. There were 41,032 votes in favour of a <b>directly</b> elected mayor and 35,880 votes against, with a 24% turnout. An election for the new post was held on 15 November 2012, and Independent candidate George Ferguson became Mayor of Bristol.|$|E

5|$|Physically, some insects {{move their}} flight muscles <b>directly,</b> others indirectly. In insects with direct flight, the wing muscles <b>directly</b> {{attached}} to the wing base, so that a small downward movement of the wing base lifts the wing itself upward. Those insects with indirect flight have muscles that attach to and deform the thorax, causing the wings to move as well.|$|E

5|$|The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system {{comprising}} the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either <b>directly</b> or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun <b>directly,</b> the largest eight are the planets, {{with the remainder}} being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.|$|E

5|$|The central figure's {{mouth is}} {{positioned}} <b>directly</b> on its neck, {{rather than on}} a distinct face. It bares its teeth {{as if in a}} snarl, and is blindfolded by a drooping cloth bandage—a device likely drawn from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ. This creature faces the viewer <b>directly</b> and is centralised by a series of converging lines radiating {{from the base of the}} pedestal.|$|E
