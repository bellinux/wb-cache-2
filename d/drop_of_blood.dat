25|$|Emperor Napoleon I plotted {{to replace}} the royal family of the Kingdom of Spain. Pursuant to his design, he ordered several key points, {{including}} Barcelona, to be seized in February 1808. On 29 February, General of Division Giuseppe Lechi's Imperial French troops were marching through Barcelona, ostensibly to help fight Portugal. Lechi staged a military review, {{but it was a}} cover for gaining control of the citadel. As the soldiers marched past the main gate of the fortress, they suddenly turned left and rushed inside. Without spilling a <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> the Imperial troops herded the baffled Spanish garrison out of the fortifications and occupied the place. Among other key points, the French also grabbed San Sebastian, Pamplona and Figueras. On 2 May 1808, the infuriated Spanish people rose in rebellion against their French occupiers.|$|E

This blood was swallowed by a washer woman, who gave birth to Chen Jinggu (陳靖姑) or Lady Linshui (臨水夫人); the hair was turned into a female white snake and sexually used men and killed rival women.

25|$|Some animists also view {{plant and}} fungi life as persons and {{interact}} with them accordingly. The most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the former's collection of the latter for food, and for animists this interaction typically has {{to be carried out}} respectfully. Harvey cited the example of Maori communities in New Zealand, who often offer karakia invocations to sweet potatoes as they dig the latter up; while doing so there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the Maori and the sweet potatoes, with both understood as having arrived in Aotearoa together in the same canoes. In other instances, animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable. Among some modern Pagans, for instance, relationships are cultivated with specific trees, who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts, such as flowers, sap, or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a wand; in return, these Pagans give offerings to the tree itself, which can {{come in the form of}} libations of mead or ale, a <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> from a finger, or a strand of wool.|$|E

500|$|Among Waugh's {{neighbours}} in Stinchcombe was Diana Oldridge, {{known in}} the Waugh family as [...] "Tanker".

500|$|An {{important}} part of the concept of the soul in Ancient Egyptian religion was thought to be the heart, or ib. The ib or metaphysical heart was believed to be formed from one <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> from the child's mother's heart, taken at conception. To ancient Egyptians, the heart was the seat of emotion, thought, will, and intention. This is evidenced by Egyptian expressions which incorporate the word ib, such as Awi-ib for [...] "happy" [...] (literally, [...] "long of heart"), Xak-ib for [...] "estranged" [...] (literally, [...] "truncated of heart"). In Egyptian religion, the heart was the key to the afterlife. It was conceived as surviving death in the nether world, where it gave evidence for, or against, its possessor. It was thought that the heart was examined by Anubis and a variety of deities during the Weighing of the Heart ceremony. If the heart weighed more than the feather of Maat, which symbolized the ideal standard of behavior. If the scales balanced, it meant the heart's possessor had lived a just life and could enter the afterlife; if the heart was heavier, it would be devoured by the monster Ammit.|$|E
