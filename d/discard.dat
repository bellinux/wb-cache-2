Although Plante had used his mask in {{practice}} since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a sinusitis operation, head coach Toe Blake was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play. However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot fired by Andy Bathgate three minutes into a game against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask. Blake agreed on the condition that Plante <b>discard</b> the mask when the cut healed. The Canadiens won the game 3–1. During the following days Plante refused to <b>discard</b> the mask, and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the economics of}} catch <b>discarding</b> in fisheries. To study this issue a simple dynamic fisheries model is constructed.

In contrast, the individual transferable quota (ITQ) fisheries management regime tends to generate an excessive incentive for <b>discarding</b> catch.

In each area, five species constituted the majority of the marketable catch (> 97 %) : sardine (Sardina pilchardus), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), round sardinella (Sardinella aurita), bogue (Boops boops) (in both areas), mackerel (Scomber japonicus; in the Aegean Sea) and picarel (Spicara smaris; in the Ionian Sea). <b>Discarded</b> quantities were on average 4. 6 % and 2. 2 % of the total catch in terms of weight in the Aegean and Ionian Seas respectively. <b>Discards</b> on the marketable ratio fluctuated over years and seasons without showing any particular trend. At the species level, sardine and mackerel were seldom <b>discarded</b> while large amounts of anchovy were <b>discarded</b> only during its recruitment period (autumn), when juvenile fish dominate the population.

The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat almost nothing else. The menhaden are swallowed whole after the head has been removed.

Results revealed <b>discards</b> were strongly positively correlated with the biomass harvested. In the higher productive zone, in Northern Catalonia, <b>discards</b> varied significantly with the season of the year, whereas in the low productive zone, in the Balearic Islands, <b>discards</b> depend {{on the characteristics of}} the biocenosis of the bottom substratum. In the coastal and shelf fisheries, the highest average biomass for retained and <b>discards</b> catches were recorded in spring and summer in Northern Catalonia and autumn and winter in the Balearic Islands. In the slope fishery the maximums were recorded in spring in Northern Catalonia and autumn in the Balearic Islands. By fishing tactic and zone, in the Northern Catalonia <b>discards</b> for coastal and shelf were mainly of fish (44 ± 25 % and 25 ± 12 % respectively). This concurs with the fact that in northern Catalonia bigger quantities of pelagic and epi-benthopelagic species with seasonal fluctuations increase in spring and summer.
