5|$|Shulgin's {{professional}} activities {{continued to}} lean {{in the direction}} of psychopharmacology, furthered by his personal experiences with psychedelics. But during this period he was unable to do much independent research. His opportunity for further research came in 1961 after his development of Zectran, the first biodegradable pesticide, a highly profitable product. In his book PIHKAL, Shulgin limits his pesticide days at <b>Dow</b> <b>Chemical</b> to one sentence in 978 pages. <b>Dow</b> <b>Chemical</b> Company, in return for Zectran's valuable patent, gave Shulgin great freedom. During this time, he created and patented drugs when Dow asked, and published findings on other drugs in journals such as Nature and the Journal of Organic Chemistry. Eventually, <b>Dow</b> <b>Chemical</b> requested that he no longer use their name on his publications.|$|E

5|$|After {{serving in}} the Navy, Shulgin {{returned}} to Berkeley, California, and in 1954 earned his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley. Through the late 1950s Shulgin completed post-doctoral {{work in the fields}} of psychiatry and pharmacology at University of California, San Francisco. After working at Bio-Rad Laboratories as a research director for a brief period, he began work at <b>Dow</b> <b>Chemical</b> Company as a senior research chemist.|$|E

5|$|A {{class action}} lawsuit, Cook v. Rockwell International Corp., was filed in January 1990 against Rockwell and <b>Dow</b> <b>Chemical</b> (due to the {{indemnity}} of nuclear contractors, the award {{would have been}} paid by the federal government). Sixteen years later, the plaintiffs were awarded $926 million in economic damages, punitive damages, and interest. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently threw out the verdict and ordered a retrial. A further appeal was rejected without comment by the United States Supreme Court in June 2012.|$|E

Total world production, for comparison purposes expressed as HCl, is estimated at 20Mt/year, with 3Mt/year from direct synthesis, and the rest as secondary product from organic and similar syntheses.

5|$|The storm {{attained}} tropical characteristics near 0000UTC while situated {{south of}} Louisiana and was subsequently designated a tropical depression. Ship communications {{off the coast}} on July24 relayed winds of 23–50knots and a barometric pressure of 1007.5mbar (29.75inHg), which indicated it was a tropical storm on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Radar imagery taken near 0733CST (1333UTC) from a <b>Dow</b> <b>Chemical</b> plant in Freeport, Texas evidenced that Debra was a full-fledged Category1 hurricane on the scale, with a prominent spiral appearance that was not perceived by the radar the previous afternoon.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} gradually strengthened, and by 1200UTC on June23, {{it reached}} tropical storm status. Over Texas, airborne radars and the <b>Dow</b> <b>Chemical</b> Company radar in Freeport indicated curved convective banding {{associated with the}} storm. Though no wall cloud was reported, the Kelly Air Force Base reported a cloud center. Late on June23, the storm intensified slightly further, and peaked with winds of 45mph (75km/h). Early on June24, the tropical storm made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas. After moving inland, the storm quickly weakened back to a tropical depression. Over the following 24hours, the depression executed a small cyclonic loop over southern Texas. On July26, the depression accelerated to the north-northeast, and eventually dissipated over northern Illinois on July29 at 0000UTC.|$|E

5|$|When World War II {{threatened}} tropical {{sources of}} natural latex for rubber, Sarnia {{was selected as}} the site to spearhead development of synthetic petroleum-based rubbers for war materials, and Polymer Corporation was built by <b>Dow</b> <b>Chemical</b> {{at the request of the}} Government of Canada. Large pipelines bring Alberta oil to Sarnia, where oil refining and petrochemical production have become mainstays of the city's economy. Shell Canada, Imperial Oil, and Suncor Energy (Sunoco) operate refineries in Sarnia. Large salt beds found under the city became a source of chlorine and other significant ingredients which contributed to the success of Chemical Valley. Chemical companies operating in Sarnia include NOVA Chemicals, Bayer (Lanxess and H.C. Starck), Cabot Corporation and Ethyl Corporation.|$|E
5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, Shell Oil {{evacuated}} about 40{{workers from}} drilling operations. BP and Chevron also evacuated workers from platforms {{in the western}} and central Gulf, though neither predicted substantial effects on production. A few oil refineries on land were closed, such as one operated by Marathon Oil in Texas City, Texas. Governor of Texas Rick Perry issued a disaster declaration for 17Texas counties that were threatened by Tropical Storm Edouard. Perry activated up to 1,200National Guard troops, a 70member rescue team, six helicopters, and an incident management team that brings food and water to affected areas. Under the order, about 200buses became available in San Antonio and Houston to help in evacuations. <b>Dow</b> <b>Chemical</b> shut down their plants in Clear Lake and La Porte. The United States Coast Guard also ceased cargo operations to the Galveston-Houston area by late on August4. Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal declared a statewide emergency. In Cameron Parish, Louisiana the Office of Emergency Preparedness ordered a mandatory evacuation, where Sheriff's deputies also erected roadblocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} jointly written by Kumar and David Brooks Miller. In order {{to present the}} correct {{technical}} and medical facts in the film, Kumar analysed documents of the court proceedings, forensic evidences and interviewed several survivors of the tragedy and also the staff members of the Union Carbide plant. Bhopal Group for Information and Action and many activists fighting {{for the rights of}} the victim of the disaster wanted to stop the film's screening, called it an insult to the victims, blamed the filmmakers of distorting the facts related to the disaster, diverting attention from <b>Dow</b> <b>Chemical</b> Company which acquired Union Carbide in 2001 and for portraying Anderson as a person who wanted to help the people but was unable to do so. Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson. Kumar also denied these allegations and said that the organisations had seen an older script. He added that making the film was a life-changing experience for him. A Prayer for Rain was added to the film's title because had it rained on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer people would have died.|$|E
50|$|Some of Dr. Kamlet’s other {{invention}}s {{dealt with}} animal feed. One such invention used newsprint for cattle feed. When the newsprint {{was replaced by}} alfalfa then the digestibility increased by 25% (Kamlet, 1955). Dr. Kamlet also used a “non-protein nitrogen supplement” in feeds and fodder. And he obtained a patent {{for the use of}} biuret for animal feed (Kamlet, 1956). <b>Dow</b> <b>Chemicals</b> bought this patent from Kamlet Laboratories for $250,000 along with any foreign royalties. Subsequently, <b>Dow</b> <b>Chemicals</b> sold it to the Shah of Iran for $1 million.|$|R

5|$|On January 31, 2004, a victim's rights group, the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/dioxin (VAVA), filed {{a lawsuit}} in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, against several U.S. {{companies}} for liability in causing personal injury, by developing, and producing the chemical, and claimed {{that the use of}} Agent Orange violated the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, 1925 Geneva Protocol, and the 1949 Geneva Conventions. <b>Dow</b> <b>Chemical</b> and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the U.S. military, and were named in the suit, along with the dozens of other companies (Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Thompson Chemicals, Hercules, etc.). On March 10, 2005, Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Eastern District – who had presided over the 1984 U.S. veterans class-action lawsuit – dismissed the lawsuit, ruling there was no legal basis for the plaintiffs' claims. He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under international law {{at the time of its}} use by the U.S.; the U.S. was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide; and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government. Weinstein used the British example to help dismiss the claims of people exposed to Agent Orange in their suit against the chemical companies that had supplied it.|$|E
