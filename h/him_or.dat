5|$|Already in his {{lifetime}} his works were adapted for theatrical, operatic and musical presentations and for the emerging film industry. Writers and poets devoted works to <b>him,</b> <b>or</b> used <b>him</b> <b>or</b> his works as inspiration. Painters created works inspired by Sienkiewicz's novels, and their works were gathered in Sienkiewicz-themed albums and exhibitions. The names of his characters were given {{to a variety of}} products. The popularity of Quo Vadis in France, where it was the best-selling book of 1900, is shown by the fact that horses competing in a Grand Prix de Paris event were named for characters in the book. In the United States, Quo Vadis sold 800,000 copies in eighteen months. To avoid intrusive journalists and fans, Sienkiewicz sometimes traveled incognito.|$|E

5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them. It {{may be used in}} combination with another remedy, most commonly a quashing order. In such a case, the quashing order will set aside the unlawful decision, and the {{mandatory order}} will require the public body to reconsider the matter. A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have legal proceedings taken against <b>him</b> <b>or</b> her for doing so.|$|E
5|$|Around 1844, {{she married}} a free black man named John Tubman. Although {{little is known about}} <b>him</b> <b>or</b> their time together, the union was {{complicated}} because of her slave status. Since the mother's status dictated that of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages – free people of color marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.|$|E
5|$|As {{a coping}} mechanism, self-harm can become psychologically {{addictive}} because, to the self-harmer, it works; it enables <b>him</b> <b>or</b> her {{to deal with}} intense stress in the current moment. The patterns sometimes created by it, such as specific time intervals between acts of self-harm, can also create a behavioural pattern that {{can result in a}} wanting or craving to fulfill thoughts of self-harm.|$|E

5|$|Charles's arrival was well-prepared. He was {{accompanied}} by his Hungarian supporters and Elizabeth was unable to raise an army against <b>him</b> <b>or</b> prevent him from convoking a diet, in which he obtained an overwhelming support.

5|$|George was {{succeeded by}} his son, George Augustus, {{who took the}} throne as George II. It was widely assumed, even by Walpole for a time, that George II planned to remove Walpole from office but was {{prevented}} from doing so by his queen, Caroline of Ansbach. However, Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George II {{had little choice but}} to retain <b>him</b> <b>or</b> risk ministerial instability. In subsequent reigns the power of the prime minister increased further at the expense of the power of the sovereign.|$|E

5|$|Girlfight {{was filmed}} over 24 days in New York and New Jersey. For scenes inside the gym where Diana and Tiny train, the filmmakers {{shot in a}} {{warehouse}} in Jersey City. The initial boxing sequences were shot from a spectator's view outside of the ring but later sequences were filmed more intimately from inside the ring. Cinematographer Patrick Cady used camera rigs that allowed the actors to hit <b>him</b> <b>or</b> the camera itself to mimic {{the feeling of being}} hit.|$|E
5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided <b>him</b> <b>or</b> not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
