40|$|Objective: An {{association}} between maternal HELLP syndrome and fetal long chain 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency has been proposed. LCHAD catalyzes {{the third step}} in the β-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria. Whereas about 75 % of LCHAD-deficient patients carry a G-to-C mutation at nucleotide position 1528 (Glu 474 Gln, <b>E</b> <b>474</b> Q) on both chromosomes, compound heterozygosity for <b>E</b> <b>474</b> Q on one chromosome and a second different LCHAD mutation on the other {{can be observed in}} up to 25 % of LCHAD-deficiency cases; only very few patients carry two mutations different from <b>E</b> <b>474</b> Q. Genetic analysis of the mother alone is insufficient in case of compound heterozygosity. Since information on the fetal carrier status of the <b>E</b> <b>474</b> Q mutation in maternal HELLP syndrome is rare, we investigated the frequency of the <b>E</b> <b>474</b> Q mutation in families where the mother had HELLP syndrome. Methods: The occurrence of the <b>E</b> <b>474</b> Q mutation was analyzed by PCR and RFLP in 103 mothers with HELLP syndrome, in 82 children of affected pregnancies and in 21 fathers in families where fetal DNA was not available. In addition, 103 control women with only uncomplicated pregnancies were investigated. Results: The mutation <b>E</b> <b>474</b> Q was not detected in the study population. Conclusion: Neither maternal nor fetal heterozygosity for the <b>E</b> <b>474</b> Q mutation is a relevant factor of HELLP syndrom...|$|E

40|$|Quinazoline- 2, 4 -diones, such as PD 0305970, are new DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (topo IV) inhibitors with potent {{activity}} against gram-positive pathogens, including quinolone-resistant isolates. The mechanistic {{basis of}} dione activity vis-à-vis quinolones is not understood. We present evidence for Streptococcus pneumoniae gyrase and topo IV that PD 0305970 and quinolones interact differently with the enzyme breakage-reunion and Toprim domains, DNA, and Mg 2 +-four components that are juxtaposed in the topoisomerase cleavage complex to effect DNA scission. First, PD 0305970 targets primarily gyrase in Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, unlike quinolones, which select predominantly for gyrA (or topo IV parC) mutations in the breakage-reunion domain, unusually the dione selected for novel mutants with alterations that map to {{a region of}} the Toprim domain of GyrB (R 456 H and <b>E</b> <b>474</b> A or <b>E</b> <b>474</b> D) or ParE (D 435 H and E 475 A). This “dione resistance-determining region” overlaps the GyrB quinolone resistance-determining region and the region that binds essential Mg 2 + ions, each function involving conserved EGDSA and PLRGK motifs. Second, dione-resistant gyrase and topo IV were inhibited by ciprofloxacin, whereas quinolone-resistant enzymes (GyrA S 81 F and ParC S 79 F) remained susceptible to PD 0305970. Third, dione-promoted DNA cleavage by gyrase occurred at a distinct repertoire of sites, implying that structural differences with quinolones are sensed at the DNA level. Fourth, unlike the situation with quinolones, the Mg 2 + chelator EDTA did not reverse dione-induced gyrase cleavage nor did the dione promote Mg 2 +-dependent DNA unwinding. It appears that PD 0305970 interacts uniquely to stabilize the cleavage complex of gyrase/topo IV perhaps via an altered orientation directed by the bidentate 3 -amino- 2, 4 -dione moiety...|$|E

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 103 rd Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research celebrado en Chicago (US) del 31 de marzo al 4 de abril de 2012. [...] et al. The BRAFV 600 E point {{mutation}} represents {{the most common}} oncogenic event in sporadic papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) pathogenesis. Although {{at a much lower}} frequency, different missense {{point mutation}}s (K 601 <b>E,</b> G <b>474</b> R, G 469 R) and complex genetic alterations, such as rearrangements (AKAP 9 -BRAF) or frameshift mutations (V 600 E-K 601 del, V 599 ins, V 600 D-FLAGT 601 - 605 ins, T 599 I-VKSRdel), have also been reported in PTC. In contrast with PTC, no other alteration different from the V 600 E substitution has been shown in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC). In this study, we sought to determine the functional relevance of particular amino acid residues, within the BRAF kinase domain, that we found mutated in some ATC. Fifty-four ATC were investigated for the existence of mutations at the activation loop, the glicine-rich phosphate-binding loop and the AKT binding sites of BRAF by means of PCR-SSCP and direct sequence. The structural-conformational changes behind punctual, unreported BRAF mutations and their effect on BRAF catalytic activity, substrate binding and downstream MAPK signalling were evaluated. Besides the V 600 E mutation, two additional point mutations (G 615 <b>E</b> and G <b>474</b> R) were detected within the BRAF kinase domain. The prevalence of both mutations, G 615 E (11 % = 6 ATC) and G 474 R (7. 4 % = 4 ATC), was much lower than that of V 600 E (20 % = 11 ATC). Interestingly, structural biology studies showed that G 615 <b>E</b> and G <b>474</b> R induced profound conformational changes within the BRAF kinase domain that resulted in reduced catalytic activity, decreased substrate binding and impaired downstream signalling. The G 474 R mutant, by preventing the N lobe from folding into a well ordered beta sheet structure, caused a broken or distorted phosphorylation-loop (P-loop). Because the P-loop is pivotal for ATP coordination and phosphotransfer reactions, the kinase activity of the BRAF G 474 R mutant was severely compromised and BRAF was unable to phosphorylate the downstream substrate. The G 615 E mutant by disrupting the structural integrity of the activation segment in the C lobe could in addition inhibit substrate binding. Significantly, none of the ATC bearing the G 615 E or the G 474 R mutation expressed the phospho-p 44 / 42 MAPK (Thr 202 /Tyr 204), which specifically recognizes the dually phosphorylated and active forms of ERK 1 and ERK 2. This observation not only supported the existence of impaired BRAF kinase activity in vivo but also suggested the abrogation of intracellular MEK/ERK signalling in those tumours. In summary, this study demonstrates that G 615 <b>E</b> and G <b>474</b> R behave similarly to D 594 V and the kinase-dead BRAFK 483 M mutant, knocking-down BRAF catalytic activity and downstream MEK/ERK signalling. These results should significantly impact on the rationale of future treatment modalities for patients with deadly ATC. Clinical trials involving the inhibitor of threonine/serine kinases Sorafenib or kinase specific inhibitors targeting constitutively active BRAF will prove inefficient therapeutic strategies in patients with G 615 <b>E</b> or G <b>474</b> R mutations.

Finally, the efficacy of SMX-TMP was monitored in vivo in a cutaneous wound model (hairless rat) infected with this bioluminescent bacterium by using a bioluminescence imaging system. E. coli was transformed by electroporation with a shuttle vector (pRB 474) containing the firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase gene, resulting in a bioluminescent phenotype. It was found that pH 5. 0 was optimal for incorporation of the susbstrate d-luciferin for the luciferase reaction.

The analytical approach taken to estimate the complex mixtures that comprise this additive involved, selective solvent extraction of the intact esters using a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and ethyl acetate, alkaline hydrolysis of the esters to liberate sucrose, and then GC-MS measurement of the liberated sucrose using GC-MS after acidic hydrolysis to glucose and fructose and then silylation. The method was developed to aid future estimates of intake of this food additive. The method determines the total sucrose esters content of a food sample and does not attempt to discrimination between individual sucrose esters when present as a mixture in a food sample. A single (average) factor is used to convert the liberated sucrose content into sucrose ester content. The method was applied to analysis of 8 different food types (including bakery wares, sugar confectionery, dairy product, margarine, meat pies and a sauce) spiked with 0. 5 to 1 % of a mixture of 3 sucrose esters that spanned the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB) range 1 - 16.

The March 7 event was one of the three eastern SEP events (east of E 15) in Table  2, the other two being 22 September 2011 (N 09 <b>E</b> 89; 2, <b>474</b> km/s) and 15 May 2013 (N 12 E 64; 2, 294 km/s). The CMEs were very fast (> 2, 200 km/s) and the latitudes were in the right range. However, the > 10 MeV event sizes were very small (35 to 41 pfu) and the events were observed only in the lowest energy channels. Fortunately, STB was well connected to these eastern events, so it was possible to check the size of the SEP event from STB data.|$|R
40|$|A proteína NSP de begomovírus facilita o transporte do DNA viral do núcleo para o citoplasma e coopera com a proteína de movimento MP para promover o transporte do DNA viral às células adjacentes não infectadas através dos plasmodesmas. A proteína NSP interage com membros da família LRR-RLK (leucine- rich repeat {{receptor}} like kinase), designados NIK (NSP-Interacting Kinase). A ligação de NSP na alça de ativação de NIK inibe a atividade quinase, e conseqüentemente, a proteína viral inibe a atividade de autofosforilação desses receptores e sua atividade de defesa antiviral. Estudos de mutagênese na alça de ativação de NIK demonstraram que o resíduo Treonina <b>474</b> <b>é</b> fosforilado {{in vitro}} e exerce uma função crucial para atividade de quinase que é requerida para sinalização antiviral. Mutação no resíduo de Thr- 474 para aspartato resulta no mutante T 474 D que exibe ativação constitutiva, atividade de fosforilaçao do substrato aumentada e menor efeito inibidor de NSP. Este trabalho teve como objetivo caracterizar o domínio quinase de NIK na resposta de defesa antiviral em tomateiros. Tomateiros foram transformados com a construção que codifica para NIK super ativa (35 S-AtNIK-T 474 D). Os transformantes primários foram selecionados por PCR e a expressão do transgene em linhagens independentes foi confirmada por RT-PCR normal e em tempo real. A super expressão da NIK 1 <b>e</b> NIK- T <b>474</b> D super ativa em tomateiros promoveu um alongamento de entrenós, mas afetou negativamente o desenvolvimento do sistema radicular, demonstrando uma possível comunicação cruzada entre a via de sinalização antiviral mediada por NIK e vias de sinalização de desenvolvimento. Experimentos de infectividade foram conduzidos em linhagens transgênicas superexpressando AtNIK ou AtNIK-T 474 D, utilizando o vírus ToYSV-[MG-Bi 2]. Super expressão de NIK super ativa alterou a taxa de infecção por ToYSV e interferiu no desenvolvimento dos sintomas. Comparado com as plantas não transformadas e a linhagem transgênica 35 S-AtNIK 1 - 6 superexpressando NIK normal, a taxa de infecção foi inferior e os sintomas mais atenuados em linhagens transgênicas independentes superexpressando AtNIK-T 474 D. Estes resultados confirmam in planta o papel essencial da fosforilação do resíduo de Treonina <b>474</b> de NIK <b>e</b> indicam a possibilidade de se desenvolverem estratégias de tolerância a geminivirus mais eficientes. The begomovirus NSP (nuclear shuttle protein) facilitates {{the transport of}} viral DNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and cooperates with the movement protein MP to promote the translocation of viral DNA to the adjacent, uninfected cells through plasmodesmata. NSP interacts {{with members of the}} LRR-RLK (leucine-rich repeat receptor like kinase) family, designated NIKs (NSP-Interacting Kinase). Binding of NSP to the activation loop of NIK inhibits kinase activity and hence the viral protein suppresses receptor autophosphorylation and defense responses. Mutagenesis assays in the activation loop of NIK have demonstrated that the threonine 474 residue is phosphorylated in vitro and plays {{a crucial role in the}} kinase activity that is required for signaling. Replacement of Thr- 474 with aspartate produces the T 474 mutant, which exhibits constitutive activation, enhanced substrate phosphorylation activity and less inhibitory effect by NSP binding. The goal of this investigation was to analyse the NIK kinase domain in defense responses against begomovirus in tomato. The NIK mutant T 474 D cDNA was placed under the control of 35 S promoter into a binary vector for plant transformation (35 S-AtNIK-T 474 D). Primary transformants were selected by PCR and the expression of the transgene was confirmed by normal and quantitative RT- PCR in independently transformed lines. NIK and NIK-T 474 D overexpression in tomato plants affected the overall developmental performance of transgenic lines, which display elongated stems and a root system less developed. These phenotypes were consistent with a cross-communication between the NIK-mediated antiviral signaling and developmental signaling pathways. Infectivity assays were carried out in AtNIK- and AtNIK-T 474 D-overexpressing lines, with the virus ToYSV-[MG-Bi 2]. Overexpression of super active AtNIK-T 474 D altered the infection rate by ToYSV, and interfered in symptom development. As compared to untransformed plants and NIK- overexpressing 35 S-AtNIK 1 - 6 transgenic lines, independent transgenic AtNIK-T 474 D lines displayed lower infection rate and attenuated symptoms. These results confirmed in planta the essential role for phosphorylation of the Thr- 474 residue for NIK function and underlined the possibility for the development of more efficient tolerance strategies against geminiviruses...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we present a {{qualitative}} and quantitative assessment of more than 10 yr of aerosol number size distribution data observed in the Arctic environment (Mt. Zeppelin (78 ° 56 ' N, 11 ° 53 ' <b>E,</b> <b>474</b> m a. s. l.), Ny Ålesund, Svalbard). We provide statistics on both seasonal and diurnal characteristics of the aerosol observations and conclude that the Arctic aerosol number size distribution and related parameters such as integral mass and surface area exhibit a very pronounced seasonal variation. This seasonal variation seems {{to be controlled by}} both dominating source as well as meteorological conditions. Three distinctly different periods can be identified during the Arctic year: the haze period characterized by a dominating accumulation mode aerosol (March–May), followed by the sunlit summer period with low abundance of accumulation mode particles but high concentration of small particles which are likely to be recently and locally formed (June–August). The rest of the year is characterized by a comparably low concentration of accumulation mode particles and negligible abundance of ultrafine particles (September–February). A minimum in aerosol mass and number concentration is usually observed during September/October. We further show that the transition between the different regimes is fast, suggesting rapid change in the conditions defining their appearance. A source climatology based on trajectory analysis is provided, and it is shown that there is a strong seasonality of dominating source areas, with Eurasia dominating during the Autumn–Winter period and dominance of North Atlantic air during the summer months. We also show that new-particle formation events are rather common phenomena in the Arctic during summer, and this is the result of photochemical production of nucleating/condensing species in combination with low condensation sink. It is also suggested that wet removal may {{play a key role in}} defining the Arctic aerosol year, via the removal of accumulation mode size particles, which in turn have a pivotal role in facilitating the conditions favorable for new-particle formation events. In summary the aerosol Arctic year seems to be at least qualitatively predictable based on the knowledge of seasonality of transport paths and associated source areas, meteorological conditions and removal processes...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the feasibility {{and safety of}} subtotal splenectomy by laparoscopy with inferior pole preservation and to determine {{the viability of the}} splenic remnant. Methods: Twenty male Wistar rats weighing between 365 g and 474 g (mean 417. 92 ± 36. 15 g SD) were operated and randomly assigned to two groups : Group 1 rats were killed on postoperative day 10 (n = 10), and Group 2 on the postoperative day 80 (n = 10). Both the inferior splenic pole and the superior part of the spleen, which was used as a control to measure inferior pole viability, were weighed and morphologically examined. Results: The technique was feasible in all cases. There were two postoperative deaths on immediate postoperative and one not well defined. The average weight percentage of the inferior pole, measured indirectly on the 10 th day, was 53. 67 % ± 11. 59 % and on the 80 th day was 62. 69 % ± 6. 89 %. The inferior pole was necrotic, with abscess formation in one case (5. 9 %) and appeared normal in all other cases. Microscopy showed features that were compatible with normality.

40|$|Introduction: There {{are five}} melanocortin receptors (MC 1 - 5) : these are G-protein-coupled receptors {{expressed}} in {{the central nervous system}} and in peripheral tissues. MC 4 and MC 5 have roles in controlling appetite, immuno-modulation, exocrine function, erectile dysfunction and grooming behaviour 1. The melanocortin receptor accessory proteins (MRAP 1 and 2) influence MC receptor transport. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is the precursor for the alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormones and adrenocorticotrophic hormone, which bind to MC 4 and MC 5 receptors 1. Aims: 1. To characterise MC 4, MC 5 and MRAP 1 distribution in the reproductive tissues of female mice (hypothalamus, pituitary gland, uterus and ovary). 2. To investigate if MC 4, MC 5 and MRAP 1 expression changes with age or pregnancy. Method: Virgin C 57 BL/ 6 female mice aged 2, 6, 9, 10 and 14 weeks and pregnant (aged 9 weeks plus 13 days post coitus) were sacrificed by schedule 1. Tissue RNA was extracted by TRIzol/RNA cleanup (Qiagen) and cDNA synthesised using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Thermoscientific). Appropriate reference genes were determined using GeNorm selection kit and software (Primerdesign; Biogazelle respectively). The following genes were the most stable and used in SYBRgreen RTqPCR according to precisionPLUS master mix protocol (Primerdesign for normalisation 2 of MC 4, MC 5 and MRAP 1 expression: Qiagen primers). Tissue	Reference gene 1 	Reference gene 2 Hypothalamus	YWHAZ	CANX Pituitary gland	EIF 4 A 2 	CANX Ovary	GAPDH	ATP 5 B Uterus	CYC 1 	RPL 13 A Results: MC 4 and MC 5 were {{expressed in the}} hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary and uterus. MC 4 and MC 5 expression was higher in 2 week old mice in the hypothalamus (n= 3, p= 0. 0056 and < 0. 0001) and uterus (n= 3, p= 0. 0119 and < 0. 0001, respectively) compared to all other age groups using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc test. Pregnancy did not affect either MC 4 or MC 5 expression. MRAP 1 was expressed in the hypothalamus, ovary and pituitary and was unaffected by age. MRAP 1 expression was greater in the ovary and decreased in the hypothalamus of pregnant compared to non-pregnant mice (n= 3, p= 0. 0004). Conclusion: The role of the two MC {{in the development of the}} hypothalamus and uterus in young mice requires further investigation. The changes in MRAP 1 expression with pregnancy could result in changes in the signalling ability of both MC 4 and MC 5 since MRAP 1 has been shown to alter cAMP production resulting from activation of these two receptors in vitro 3.

Dentre estas, destacou-se a de prefixo MP 388 - 6, que atingiu o nível mais elevado de produção do experimento. As progênies de 'Mundo-Novo', em conjunto, produziram 44 % a mais do que as de Bourbon-Amarelo e, estas, 60 % a mais do que as de Bourbon-Vermelho e Caturra-Vermelho. A altura e o diâmetro da copa atingiram valores médios mais elevados para as progênies de 'Mundo-Novo'. Verificaram-se correlações positivas e altamente significativas entre altura média da planta e diâmetro médio da copa com a produção das progênies. As progênies mais produtivas revelaram rendimento (relação entre peso de café maduro e beneficiado) de aproximadamente 6, 0 e porcentagem de sementes normais, do tipo chato, acima de 80. Quanto ao tamanho das sementes do tipo chato, duas progênies 'Mundo-Novo' S 1, MP <b>474</b> <b>e</b> MP 452, apresentaram peneira média maior, permi-tindo seleção de plantas com essa característica e com elevada produção.

Atua como primeiro hospedeiro intermediário de diversos trematódeos de importância médica. As populações são compostas majoritariamente por fêmeas partenogenéticas que possuem um marsúpio onde se desenvolvem os juvenis. Os objetivos foram verificar: a presença de machos; se existem flutuações na produção de ovos e juvenis ao longo do tempo; quando a maturidade sexual é atingida e, a existência de parasitos relacionando sua presença com o número de ovos e juvenis. Para a contagem de ovos e juvenis, foram utilizadas fêmeas coletadas bimestralmente de setembro/ 07 a outubro/ 10, separadas em quatro classes de tamanho, segundo o diâmetro da concha: Classe I: 9 mm. Separamos cinco fêmeas/classe, totalizando 20 fêmeas/coleta, exceto nas amostras de setembro/ 07 (16 exemplares), abril/ 09 (19 exemplares) e de abril/ 10 (13 exemplares), totalizando 348 fêmeas. Para observação dos parasitos, ovos e juvenis o teto da cavidade palial foi retirado e o marsúpio dissecado. Classificamos os juvenis em classes de acordo com o número de voltas: com menos de duas; com duas a quatro e com mais de quatro. Os dados foram analisados utilizando Excel e SYSTAT 12. Para a histologia da gônada e do marsúpio, utilizamos cinco exemplares coletados mensalmente de setembro/ 12 a fevereiro/ 13, de cada classe de tamanho, totalizando 20 espécimes/coleta, exceto em outubro/ 12, quando 16 espécimes foram usados, pois somente um espécime da Classe IV foi encontrado. Os espécimes foram fixados em formalina Millonig de Carson, descalcificados em EDTA, incluídos em parafina e corados em hematoxilina e eosina. Foram encontrados 16 machos. Quantificamos 24. 694 ovos <b>e</b> 31. <b>474</b> juvenis, com as seguintes médias: Classe I: 0 ovos e 0, 31 juvenis; Classe II: 24, 19 ovos e 47, 56 juvenis; Classe III: 114, 84 ovos e 155, 78 juvenis; Classe IV: 146, 76 ovos e 158, 41 juvenis. O teste de Kruskal-Wallis mostrou que existe variação significativa no número de ovos e juvenis ao longo do ano (p < 0, 01 para ambos) e entre o número de ovos e juvenis entre as diferentes classes de tamanho de concha (p < 0, 01 para ambos). Foram contabilizados 27. 877 juvenis com menos de duas voltas, 3. 251 juvenis com duas a quatro voltas e 346 juvenis com mais de quatro voltas. Dentre 348 fêmeas, 111 estavam parasitadas (32 % do total) por Centrocestus formosanus (Nishigori, 1924). O Teste de Mann-Whitney, levando em consideração todas as fêmeas, demonstrou que fêmeas parasitadas apresentaram menor número de ovos e juvenis que as não parasitadas (p< 0, 01). Excluindo as fêmeas da Classe 1, o resultado do teste foi o mesmo (p< 0, 01). Concluímos que: a população de M. tuberculata da Vila do Abraão não é formada somente por fêmeas; as fêmeas se reproduzem o ano todo, pois foram encontrados ovos e juvenis em todas as coletas; que quanto maior a fêmea há mais ovos e, em média, há mais juvenis no marsúpio; que a maturidade sexual é alcançada com aproximadamente 3 mm de diâmetro de concha, devido a presença de ovócitos vitelogênicos tardios e, que o parasitismo afeta negativamente M. tuberculata, reduzindo o número de ovos e juvenis formadosMelanoides tuberculata (Müller, 1774), {{an exotic}} {{freshwater}} snail of Afro-Asiatic origin, was first recorded to Vila do Abraão, Ilha Grande, Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro, in 2005. It acts as first intermediate host for trematodes of medical importance. The populations are mostly composed by parthenogenetic females {{that have a}} brood-pouch, where occurs {{the development of the}} juveniles. The objectives were to verify the presence of males; to check if there are fluctuations in the production of eggs and juveniles along time, to determine when sexual maturity is reached and to check for parasites and relate their presence with the number of eggs and juveniles. To count eggs and juveniles, we used females collected bimonthly from September/ 07 to October 07 / 10, separated into four classes according to the diameter of the shell: Class I: 9 mm. We selected five females/class, totaling 20 females/collect, except for the samples of September/ 07 (16 specimens), April/ 09 (19 specimens) and April/ 10 (13 specimens), totaling 348 females. To observe parasites, eggs and juveniles, the molluscs had the roof of the cavity and brood-pouch dissected. The juveniles were separated into classes according to the number of shell whorls: less than two whorls, with two to four whorls, and more than four whorls. The data was analyzed using an Excel spreadsheet and the statistic package SYSTAT 12. For histology of gonad and brood-pouch, five specimens of each of the four size classes, collected monthly from September/ 12 to February/ 13 were used, totaling 20 specimens/collect except to the sample from October/ 12, with 16 specimens since only one specimen from Class IV was found. The specimens were fixed in Carsons Millonig formalin, decalcified with EDTA, embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. We found 16 males. We count 24. 694 eggs and 31. 474 youngs in total, showing the following averages: Class I: 0 eggs and 0. 31 juveniles, Class II: 24. 19 eggs and 47. 56 juveniles, Class III: 114. 84 eggs and 155. 78 juveniles, Class IV: 146. 76 eggs and 158. 41 juveniles. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there are significant variation in the number of eggs and juveniles along the year (p< 0. 01 for eggs and juveniles). It was found {{a significant difference between the}} number of eggs and juveniles according to different shell size classes (p< 0. 01 for both). We count 27. 877 juveniles with less than two whorls, 3. 251 with two to four whorls and 346 juveniles with more than four whorls. We found 111 females parasitized by Centrocestus formosanus (Nishigori, 1924) out of 348 females (32 % of total). The Mann-Whitney test showed that the parasitized females presented a smaller number of eggs and juveniles compared to the nonparasitized (p< 0. 01 for both). The Mann-Whitney test excluding females from Class 1 show the same result with p< 0. 01 for both. We conclude that the population of M. tuberculata from Vila do Abraão isnt composed only by females; the females reproduce during all the year, because eggs and juveniles were found in all the field surveys, and larger females have more eggs and, on average, more juveniles in the brood-pouch; the reproductive maturity should begin with approximately 3 mm shell diameter, because we observed late vitelogenic oocytes in the ovary and that parasitism affects negatively M. tuberculata, reducing the number of eggs and juveniles forme...|$|R

Este é um estudo retrospectivo através da revisão de prontuários dos pacientes submetidos à mobilização, coleta e infusão de células-tronco hematopoiéticas periféricas para transplante autogênico, com o objetivo de avaliar estes procedimentos, identificar as características da população atendida e verificar a mortalidade relacionada ao transplante e sobrevida global dos pacientes transplantados. Foram incluídos 176 pacientes (78 F/ 98 M) do Serviço de Hematologia-Oncologia do Hospital Universitário de Santa Maria, no período de dezembro de 1996 a dezembro de 2011. Os diagnósticos incluíram: Mieloma Múltiplo (54), Linfoma de Hodgkin (47), Linfoma não Hodgkin (35), Leucemia Mielóide Aguda (16) e outras neoplasias (24), como Câncer de Mama, Tumor de Wilms, Sarcoma de Ewing, Neuroblastoma, Amiloidose, Tumor de Testículo, Meduloblastoma, Macroglobulinemia, Tumor de SNC. A mediana de idade dos pacientes foi de 42 anos (1 a 69 anos). Antes da mobilização de célulastronco, todos os pacientes já haviam sido submetidos a algum tratamento relacionado a doença de base e 31 % haviam recebido radioterapia prévia. Os esquemas de mobilização incluíram fator de crescimento hematopoiético (G-CSF) associado ou não a diferentes quimioterapias. Foram {{realizadas}} 203 mobilizações <b>e</b> <b>474</b> leucoaféreses. O número desejado de células CD 34 + na coleta foi de 2, 0 x 106 /kg, sendo que a maioria dos pacientes (89, 8 %) alcançou a quantidade esperada. A mediana de células nucleadas totais coletadas foi de 7, 01 x 108 /kg e de células CD 34 + foi de 2, 63 x 106 /kg, com mediana de duas leucoaféreses por paciente (1 a 6). Dos 176 pacientes do estudo, 120 foram submetidos a transplante autogênico de células-tronco hematopoiéticas do sangue periférico, sendo que três pacientes receberam duas infusões cada. A mediana de células nucleadas totais infundidas foi de 6, 46 x 108 /kg e de células CD 34 + foi de 3, 17 x 106 /kg. Após a infusão das células-tronco hematopoiéticas, a recuperação dos neutrófilos ocorreu entre 7 e 28 dias (mediana 10 dias), enquanto as plaquetas entre os dias 8 e 79 (mediana 12 dias), sendo que em três pacientes não houve recuperação plaquetária. Foi encontrada correlação entre a quantidade de células CD 34 + infundidas e recuperação de neutrófilos e plaquetas. A taxa de mortalidade relacionada ao transplante foi de 5 %. A probabilidade de sobrevida global do grupo em um ano foi de 79, 8 % e em cinco anos de 55, 1 %. Em conclusão, este estudo demonstrou que a maioria dos pacientes atingiu a quantidade desejada de células CD 34 + através das mobilizações e coletas e os resultados obtidos com os transplantes autogênicos foram semelhantes aos descritos na literatura. The transplantation of hematopoietic {{peripheral blood}} stem cells {{is one of the}} therapeutic choices for the treatment of various hematological and oncological diseases, extending disease-free survival and, in some cases, providing the cure of the patient. This is a retrospective study in which the medical records of patients who underwent mobilization, collection and infusion of peripheral hematopoietic stem cells for autologous transplantation were analyzed with the objective of evaluating these procedures, identifying the characteristics of the population assisted and verifying the transplant-related mortality and overall survival of transplanted patients. The study analyzes 176 patients (78 F/ 98 M) of the Hematology-Oncology Service of the University Hospital of Santa Maria (HUSM) in the period between December 1996 and December 2011. The diagnoses included: Multiple Myeloma (54), Hodgkin Lymphoma (47), Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (35), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (16) and other neoplasias (24) such as Breast Cancer, Wilms Tumor, Ewings Sarcoma, Neuroblastoma, Amyloidosis, Testicular Tumor, Medulloblastoma, Macroglobulinemia, CNS Tumor. The median age of the patients was 42 years (1 to 69 years). Before the stem cells mobilization, all the patients had already been submitted to some kind of treatment related to the disease and 31 % had received previous radiotherapy. The mobilization schema included hematopoietic growth factor (G-CSF) associated our not whit different chemotherapies. The number of mobilization and leukapheresis carried out were 203 and 474 respectively. The desired number of CD 34 + cells in the collection was 2, 0 x 106 /kg, considering that the majority of patients achieved the quantity expected. The median of total nucleated cells collected was 7, 01 x 108 /kg and of CD 34 + cells it was of 2, 63 x 106 /kg, with a median of two leukapheresis per patient (1 to 6). Of the 176 patients in this study 120 patients were submitted to autologous transplantation, three received two infusions each. The median of total nucleated cells infused was 6, 46 x 108 /kg and of CD 34 + cells was 3, 17 x 106 /kg. After the infusion of hematopoietic stem cells, the recovery of neutrophils occurred between 7 and 28 days (median 10 days), while the platelets between 8 and 79 (median 12 days), considering that three patients did not have platelet recovery. The correlation between the quantity of CD 34 + cells infused and the recovery of neutrophils and platelets was verified. Transplantrelated mortality was 5 %. The probability of overall survival of the group in a year was of 79, 8 % and 55, 1 % in five years. In conclusion, this study demonstrated {{that the majority of the}} patients achieved the desired number of CD 34 + cells through mobilization and collection and the results obtained with autologous transplantation were similar to those described in the literature...|$|E

H 577 P BSE 2015 Gaoxxix, 193 pages :color illustrationsIt is {{reported}} that wind energy plays {{a significant role}} in the global renewable energy power markets with an increased installation capacity. However,most operating wind farm cannot generate as much power as predicted because of the wake effect. The inaccurate wake model and unsuitable turbine layout can enlarge this difference. Therefore, this research project aims to investigate the turbine wake model analytically and experimentally and then,to propose a program to conduct the turbine layout optimization in a large wind farm. Based on these, the offshore wind power potential of the Hong Kong offshore areas is assessed and the optimal layout pattern of wind turbines under Hong Kong offshore wind power exploitation conditions is recommended, which is very useful for Hong Kong offshore wind energy utilization. Firstly, the thesis develops a new model based on the Jenson's wake model, which regards the velocity deficit in a wake at a specific downwind distance as a linear one, with no consideration of the wind velocity profile on the radial direction. The new proposed wake model overcomes the shortcomings of Jenson's wake model and develops it to a 2 D model using Gaussian function. The results from this model can well express the turbine wake characteristics such as the velocity deficit, wake width and centerline. Based on this model, the velocity deficit profiles at both downwind and radial directions can be calculated. The other improvement from this new model is that, when determining the turbine layout in a wind farm, the local velocity field of a turbine in the wake caused by upwind one is determined and calculated by the relative distance of the two turbines at two directions (downwind and radial) instead of downwind distance only. Moreover, a multiple wake model is developed to describe the wake profile generated by numbers of turbine in a row. The multiple wake model is the superposition of the Gaussian functions and in which, the sub-wake characteristics of each turbines can also be expressed with parameters in the formula. In order to validate the accuracy of the new model, the measured wind data from a 300 MW operating wind farm, i. e. the CWEX- 13 located in Iowa of the United States, are analyzed. The undisturbed wind,wind after one row of turbine and wake after two rows were measured. The wind conditions at different downwind distance of four-turbines-in-row were measured too. The wake characteristics, such as the wake width,velocity deficit under different atmospherics stabilities and turbulence intensities are studied. For the first time,the wakes are distinguished as the inner wake and outer wake, depending on the relative locations of the turbines. The inner and outer wake characteristic are quantified and compared with each other. Results show that, the velocity deficit,immediately behind the turbine,is initially about 70 %- 75 % for the inner wake and, 55 %- 60 % for outer wake. Notably, significant velocity deficit is still apparent even as far as 10 D behind the turbines, about 30 %- 35 %. The same thing happens for the wake width. At the very beginning when the flow pass through the turbines, the wake expansion is 1. 7 D for outer turbines while 1. 6 D for the inner one. Noted that D represents the turbine rotor diameter. Another important conclusion is that, the outer wakes vanish faster than the inner wake (The inner deficit is 1. 164 multiples of the outer deficit while the inner wake width is 0. 87 multiples of that of the outer one). In this thesis,it is concluded that the ambient stability does not have significantly influence on the velocity deficit and wake width for these four turbines. The second main contribution from this thesis is a proposed Multi-Population Genetic Algorithm (MPGA) simulation model for wind turbine layout optimization which is a long-history research hotspot started from 1983. The optimal turbine layout pattern can increase the power generation of the wind farm, reduce the wake interaction between wind turbines,which otherwise would increase dynamic mechanical load and cause higher fatigue load. Many researchers have been working on this topic with different methods, and the proposed MPGA program has been validated by solving the same wind farm optimization issues. More power generation with a lower cost of energy (COE) demonstrates the advancement of this model. For this optimization program, the focus in this thesis goes further. The new proposed wake model is used in this program with a comprehensive cost model, which considers the local wind farm development conditions including labour cost. By using this optimization simulation model, together with wind farm size, wind data and turbine characteristics as inputs,the simulation model can generate the optimal layout for the turbines with total power generations, COE and wind farm efficiency and so on. It {{is reported}} that, for the Case of 'constant wind speed of 12 m/s with variable wind direction',using the newly-developed Jenson-Gaussian wake model in the MPGA optimization program make the power generation and wind farm efficiency decreased than that of the Jenson's wake model. The power loss caused by wake effect is about 20 %, which is in accordance with previous literatures. Three layout patterns can be chosen before the program is started, i. e. aligned, staggered and scatter ones. Besides, the offshore wind developing conditions in Hong Kong are studied. The total water area suitable for offshore wind farm development is determined after considering the local water conditions, wind condition and water area usage purposes. The potential offshore wind farm area in and beyond Hong Kong's boundary (2 km) is about 357. 78 km 2 (21. 68 % of the HK's water area). Finally, four typical offshore wind farm sites located at different water areas in Hong Kong are selected. Using the MPGA optimization program, the top ten optimal layout patterns for each potential site are proposed. The Hong Kong offshore wind power potential is reported with the COE and wind farm efficiency. It is estimated that the optimal wind turbine layout separation is 14. 5 D in prevailing wind direction and 11. 0 D in cross wind direction (D represent the turbine rotor diameter). The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is calculated in HK$ terms, i. <b>e.</b> 1. <b>474</b> /kWh (aligned), 1. 467 /kWh (staggered), nd 1. 290 /kWh (scattered). APG (annual energy generation) is determined to be 40. 80 × 10 x/y 8 kWh (aligned), 40. 42 × 10 x/y 8 kWh (staggered), and 33. 98 × 10 x/y 8 kWh (scattered), representing 9. 48 % (aligned), 9. 39 % (staggered), and 7. 89 % (scattered) of the annual electricity consumption for HK in 2012. The results can provide guidance for the government or private developers to develop the offshore wind farms in Hong Kong. In summary,this research project developed a new analytical wake model and proved its practicability as the basic velocity deficits calculation models. The wake characteristics based on the new model are estimated. The newly-developed MPGA optimization program has a good performance on wind turbine layout optimization within wind farm and also, its availability in solving the real-world offshore wind farm turbine micro-siting has been validated. The optimization for Hong Kong offshore wind farm with the offshore wind energy assessment process can provide a new thought and filled the research gaps for the wind farm development and wind energy assessment in this research area.
