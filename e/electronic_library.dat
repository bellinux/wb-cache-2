5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the blast makes Rei realize that he was human all along, and that {{everyone else in the}} town were Phiroids. After collecting some supplies, the three of them leave the town and make it to the facility where Rei originally woke up, which still has some electricity. Tipi gives Rei access to an <b>electronic</b> <b>library</b> on a tablet shortly before her battery is no longer able to function. Rei and Shiona stay in the facility for a time until Shiona eventually succumbs to the gunshot wound which had damaged her internal components. Rei puts Shiona and Tipi in cryogenic pods before leaving with the music box in an attempt to find a world where humans and Phiroids can coexist. Sometime later, Shiona wakes up in a facility with her memories wiped, but she is told that there was a music box with her when she was found. The environment has recovered and human civilization is once again prosperous and highly technological. Shiona is taken back to the town where humans and Phiroids once again coexist. She is reunited with Tipi, who also had her memories wiped. Prompted by the tune playing from the music box, Shiona sings the song which is now known worldwide.|$|E

25|$|To {{this day}} some still lobby for the re-use of the College Green House of Parliament. In 2006, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Eamon Ryan, met with Bank of Ireland's chief {{executive}} and chair to propose that the building {{be used as an}} <b>electronic</b> <b>library.</b> In 2010, Minister of State, Seán Haughey, proposed that the building be handed over to the state in return for the Irish state's bailout of the bank during the Irish banking crisis. Both suggestions were rejected by the bank. Other suggestions included that the building be used to house the bank's former art collection, that it be used as an office for an elected Lord Mayor of Dublin or that it house the Dáil or Seanad and act as a parliament building again. In 2011, Jimmy Deenihan, Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, wrote to the bank setting out proposals to acquire the building as a venue for the state to use as a cultural venue and requesting a meeting with the bank's Governor. Teachta Dála Kevin Humphreys in 2012 also called for the bank to return the building to the state.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{variance}} between professionals {{on the use of}} terminology to describe and define this form of child maltreatment may lead to a loss of focus on children 2 ̆ 7 s welfare. The author {{argues that the}} label Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy has outlived its use and recommends the adoption of a new label 2 ̆ 7 Fabrication or Induction of Illness in a Child 2 ̆ 7. The article presents a critical analysis of the titles of 410 unique library entries collated from <b>electronic</b> <b>libraries</b> to discern the prevalence of labels to denote the fabrication or induction of illness in children. The article also reviews recent developments in the UK courts and some critical observations on the challenges to the field. The author notes with concern that there {{does not appear to be}} a preponderance of service user narratives or critical perspectives in the literature. The adoption of a more critical orientation and the acknowledgement of critical service user narratives may be a useful focus for future research. The paper reviews the merits of <b>electronic</b> <b>libraries</b> to efficiently discern an up to date reading list on a particular theme or issue. <b>Electronic</b> <b>libraries</b> can be of particular use to research minded practitioners and as a tool to support evidence based practice.
