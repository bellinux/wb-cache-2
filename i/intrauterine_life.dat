40|$|The newborn’s {{transition}} from <b>intrauterine</b> to extrauterine <b>life</b> {{is marked by}} a chain of rapid and complex physiological changes. For example, this adaptive process is characterised by the {{transition from}} foetal ‘respiratory’ activity to normal ventilation. 1 Onset of respiration stimulates a series of cardiopulmonary changes – e. g. increase in pulmonary blood flow and closure of the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus – as the newborn makes the transition from foetal to neonatal circulation. Furthermore, in utero, the foetus is dependent on the placenta and swallowed amniotic fluid for its nutrition. Pivotal, too, is the physiological transition that occurs as the foetus, once born, replaces the placenta with his gastrointestinal (GI) tract to obtain nutrition. Enteral feeding, preferably breast milk, is vital for optimal growth and development of the newborn. 2 Therefore, adequate gut development and maturation is indispensable in maintaining neonatal health...|$|R

Fetal tissues from 23 second-trimester abortuses were examined. The presence of HIV- 1 nucleic acid sequences was determined by the polymerase chain reaction and used to define infection of the fetus.

40|$|The {{prostate}} is {{an accessory}} sex gland that develops under precise androgenic control.

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the prostates of old male gerbils exposed to testosterone during <b>intrauterine</b> and postnatal <b>life</b> using morphological, biometrical, stereological, Kariometric, immunohistochemical, and immunofluorescence analyses. Our findings demonstrate that prenatal and pubertal exposure to testosterone increases the susceptibility to the development of prostate diseases during aging. The presence of a more proliferative gland associated with foci of adenomatous hyperplasia in animals exposed to testosterone during the prenatal and pubertal phase show that the utero life and the pubertal period are important phases for prostatic morphophysiology establishment, which is a determinant for the health of the gland during aging.

Among other hormones, leptin plays a major role in the regulation of the overall metabolism and has multiple neuroendocrine (adeno- and neuro-hypophysis axes and the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis) and immune functions. The hormone exerts its actions beginning in the early life time period, regulating the intrauterine and early extrauterine life growth and development, as well as the adaptation to extrauterine life, neonatal thermogenesis and response to stress. Recent findings also support a role of leptin in the process of fetal bone remodeling and brain development. Therefore, it is of interest to explore the physiology of leptin in early life, as well as those factors that may perturb the balance of the hormone with pathological consequences in terms of confining an increased risk for disease in later life.

A failure to decrease or a spontaneous increase of genomic instability can promote infertility, pregnancy losses, chromosomal and genomic diseases, cancer, immunodeficiency, or brain diseases depending on developmental stage at which it occurs. Paradoxically, late ontogeny is associated with increase of genomic instability that is considered a probable mechanism for human aging. The latter is even more appreciable in human diseases associated with pathological or accelerated aging (i. e. Alzheimer’s disease and ataxia-telangiectasia). These observations resulted in a hypothesis suggesting that somatic genomic variations throughout ontogeny are determinants of cellular vitality in health and disease including <b>intrauterine</b> development, postnatal <b>life</b> and aging.
