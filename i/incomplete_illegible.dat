50|$|Paper-based {{documentation}} {{has been}} found to be inferior in comparison with electronic documentation. This is caused by the inherent nature of paper being difficult to update, time-consuming in a recording. Thus, the records are often <b>incomplete,</b> <b>illegible,</b> repetitive and missing signatures.Electronic nursing documentation systems have the potential to improve the quality of documentation structure and format, process and content in comparison with paper-based documentation, as demonstrated in a comparative study of electronic and paper-based nursing admission forms. However, improvement in documentation quality is not necessarily to be brought about by the introduction of electronic nursing documentation system to replace paper-based documentation. For example, Wang et al. that although the electronic nursing assessment form contained more documented assessment forms, which covered a wider range of resident care needs, they did not perform better than the previous paper-based assessment forms according to the quality criteria of completeness and timeliness. Therefore, further work on the usage of the electronic documentation systems may focus on improving form design and usage. There is also a need for improvement in compliance with standards in order to better meet the clients' care needs.|$|E
40|$|Cases {{from the}} files of Action for Victims of Medical Accidents which had {{resulted}} in stillbirth, perinatal or neonatal death and long term mental or physical handicap were reviewed. In 41 cases there was both a detailed letter from the parents and an independent review by a senior obstetrician. The reviewer's main criticisms were of inadequate fetal heart monitoring, lack of involvement of senior staff and inadequate records. The fetal heart trace was missing in 7 cases and {{over half of the}} remaining 34 traces available were misinterpreted or not acted on. In 17 cases junior doctors failed to recognize fetal distress and managed a delivery {{that they did not have}} the experience to deal with. In a further 6 cases, senior staff were called but did not come. Records were criticized for being <b>incomplete,</b> <b>illegible</b> or missing. In a few cases unjustified alterations appeared to have been made. Women reported that on some occasions staff ignored their worries, were unsympathetic and gave too little information. Some parents also experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining a clear explanation of the nature and cause of their child's condition...|$|E
40|$|Background: MediCapt is {{a mobile}} application, {{currently}} under development, that digitises a medical intake form for sexual violence survivors {{such that it}} captures and preserves court-admissible evidence. The medical intake forms currently in use tend to produce <b>incomplete,</b> <b>illegible,</b> or even inconsistent reports that are often dismissed in court. MediCapt replaces paper documents and will be designed with prompts that help doctors avoid common mistakes, remind them of the necessary information needed for a forensic medical examination, and catch inconsistencies before the form is completed. MediCapt v 1. 0 was piloted in Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in January, 2014, with seven clinicians, {{all of whom were}} participants in Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) trainings on forensic documentation. We then tested MediCapt in the field to gather feedback on the usability of MediCapt within the DRC that would inform ongoing development. Methods: PHR is employing a process of “collaborative design” in the development of MediCapt. This process seeks and incorporates feedback from the ultimate end-users and is in iterative process. We conducted a 3 month field test of MediCapt with seven clinicians in both North and South Kivu from March to May, 2014. During this field test, clinicians were asked to (1) provide feedback on various aspects of the app including ease of use, and (2) complete several tasks including the inputting of patient case scenarios to simulate real-life patient information. Findings: Clinicians initially reported a lack of usability, and suggested that the form on the application be shorter. They suggested enhanced features including a camera function and ability to draw on a pictogram, and that the system be able to accommodate use by not only clinicians but also others within the justice process. Interpretation: Using the lessons learned from both the pilot and field-test of the first MediCapt version reported here, we developed MediCapt v 2. 0, which was tested with Congolese clinicians in January, 2015. Feedback from this testing will be reflected in the next version of MediCapt due later in 2015. In addition to improving documentation of individual cases, MediCapt, when in wide use, will also address gaps in data collection. By aggregating the data from the uploaded medical forms, Physicians for Human Rights will have access to de-identified information on cases of sexual violence that can inform humanitarian responses across various regions. MediCapt will also strengthen the security of medical data, improve standardisation of forensic assessments, and enhance the quality of the forensic medical evidence to ultimately support effective prosecutions of sexual violence cases. Challenges related to the application's development include ensuring proper security standards and data encryption, developing strategies to overcome low network connectivity in end users' environments, and users' fluency with a smart-phone-based application. A robust monitoring and evaluation plan is being concurrently developed to track the early testing phases of the application.

40|$|Intake and Output (I/O) {{records in}} {{hospitals}} were often {{found to be}} <b>incomplete</b> and <b>illegible.</b> The form used to record I/O is not user-friendly — i. e., they feature miniscule boxes, ‘total’ lines that do not correspond with shift changes and lack of instructions. Complaints often received from Specialists & Doctors regarding calculation errors or no totalling of I/O. Moreover, Nursing Sisters objective rounds often saw incompleteness of I/O chart. This study aims to identify the types of mistakes in recording the existing I/O chart. The second aim {{is to find out}} whether shift totalling of I/O chart helps in reducing mistakes. We try to determine whether the identified mistakes were repeated in the new I/O Chart. This study was conducted from October till December 2010 in 9 selected wards in Sibu Hospital.

40|$|Objectives: Quantitative {{evaluation}} of safety after {{the implementation of}} a computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system, stratification of residual risks to drive future developments. Design: Comparative risk analysis of the drug prescription process before and after the implementation of CPOE system, according to the Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) method. Measurements: The failure modes were defined and their criticality indices calculated {{on the basis of the}} likelihood of occurrence, potential severity for patients, and detection probability. Criticality indices of handwritten and electronic prescriptions were compared, the acceptability of residual risks was discussed. Further developments were proposed and their potential impact on the safety was estimated. Results: The sum of criticality indices of 27 identified failure modes was 3813 for the handwritten prescription, 2930 (− 23 %) for CPOE system, and 1658 (− 57 %) with 14 enhancements. The major safety improvements were observed for errors due to ambiguous, <b>incomplete</b> or <b>illegible</b> orders (− 245 points), wrong dose determination (− 217) and interactions (− 196). Implementation of targeted pop-ups to remind treatment adaptation (− 189), vital signs (− 140), and automatic edition of documents needed for the dispensation (− 126) were the most promising proposed improvements. Conclusion: The impact of a CPOE system on patient safety strongly depends on the implemented functions and their ergonomics. The use of risk analysis helps to quantitatively evaluate the relationship between a system and patient safety and to build a strategy for continuous quality improvement, by selecting the most appropriate improvements to the syste...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background ART is a multi-centre {{randomised}} {{trial of}} cardiac surgery which provided {{a unique opportunity}} to evaluate the data from a large number of centres from a variety of countries. We attempted to assess data quality, including recruitment rates, timeliness and completeness of the data obtained from the centres in different socio-economic strata. Methods The analysis was based on the 2 -page CRF completed at the 6 week follow-up. CRF pages were categorised into "clean" (no edit query) and "dirty" (any <b>incomplete,</b> inconsistent or <b>illegible</b> data). The timelines were assessed {{on the basis of the}} time interval from the visit and receipt of complete CRF. Data quality was defined as the number of data queries (in percent) and time delay (in days) between visit and receipt of correct data. Analyses were stratified according to the World Bank definitions into: "Developing" countries (Poland, Brazil and India) and "Developed" (Italy, UK, Austria and Australia).
